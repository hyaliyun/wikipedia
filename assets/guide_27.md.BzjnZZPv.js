He was a product of the Colchester United Academy, going on to make one first-team substitute appearance for the club. He has also represented Folkestone Invicta, Halstead Town, East Thurrock United and AFC Sudbury. Career Born in Chelmsford, Webb joined the Colchester United Academy at the age of 11. He featured regularly in Colchester's senior youth sides prior to his 16th birthday and finished as top scorer in both of his apprenticeship years with the club. His willingness and ability saw him awarded a professional contract in the summer of 2007, signing a deal alongside fellow youth-team products Tom Devaux, Medy Elito and Anthony Wordsworth. Webb made his first and only first-team appearance for Colchester during an injury and suspension crisis during their second-ever season in the Championship, featuring as a substitute at the first-ever competitive fixture at Shrewsbury Town's New Meadow stadium on 14 August 2007. As the fixture went to extra time and Colchester conceding in the 106th minute, Webb was brought on as a replacement for defender John White in the 112th minute as the U's desperately searched for a goal. It wasn't to be a dream debut for Webb as Colchester were defeated 1‚Äì0. In February 2008, Webb was sent on loan for one month to Folkestone Invicta. He was then released at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season as Colchester were relegated from the Championship to League One. He was released alongside Tom Devaux, Danny Granville, Luke Guttridge and Kevin Watson, while Aidan Davison and Teddy Sheringham retired. Following his release from Colchester, Webb travelled to Spain to join the Glenn Hoddle Academy, before joining Harlow Town. He then signed for Halstead Town prior to the 2009‚Äì10 season. He signed for AFC Sudbury in May 2010, scoring two goals in 21 appearances prior to his release from the club in January 2011. Webb then returned to the club in March 2011, where he remained until the end of the season. Summer 2011 saw Webb depart Sudbury, joining Tilbury, with whom he stayed until the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. He once again returned to Sudbury for the beginning of the 2012‚Äì13 season, but yet again departed to Tilbury in December 2012.

It skirted the Hokonui Hills, and operated as a through route between 31 July 1880 and 1 April 1971, with the short section from Lumsden to Balfour continuing as the Balfour Branch until 15 January 1978. Construction The Waimea Plains Railway was built in order to improve communication between Dunedin and the Lake Wakatipu district. At the time, construction of the Otago Central Railway had barely begun and the only other way to reach the region by rail - the most efficient form of transport in the days before modern road transport ‚Äì involved a detour south via Invercargill. The Waimea Plains Railway Company was formed in 1878 in New Zealand under the District Railways Act of 1877, and began construction on 11 January 1879. The easy terrain meant construction was swift, with the last rail laid on 24 May 1880 and the official opening a couple of months later on 21 July. The Waimea Plains Railway Company was part of several companies speculating in land settlement in Southland set up by politicians including Robert Stout and William Larnach, along with the New Zealand Agricultural Company (set up in London in 1879) and then the New Zealand Land and Loan Company. By 1879 these companies were precarious financially, and the whole scheme was \\"little short of a scam\\". Bourke says that Governor George Grey not agreeing to purchase the Waimea Plains Railway Company in 1879 was the reason for subsequent fall of the Grey ministry. This and several other private railway companies were later purchased by the new Stout-Vogel ministry. Stout's financial affairs were covered up in 1893 by Richard Seddon, Stout's rival in the Liberal Party, provided that Stout left politics.Kelburn, King Dick and the Kelly Gang: Richard Seddon and Political Patronage by Kevin Bourke, pp 86-87 (2008, Hit or Miss Publishing, Wellington) After some disputes with the government over ownership and distribution of profits, the government acquired the line under the District Railways Act in 1886 and integrated it in the New Zealand Railways Department on 13 November 1886, according to New Zealand Railways Geographical Mileage Table (1957) and the An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand (1966). (David Leitch and Brian Scott give the date as 31 March in Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, while Geoffrey B. Churchman and Tony Hurst state 30 July in The Railways Of New Zealand: A Journey Through History). Stations The following stations were on the Waimea Plains Railway, with in brackets the distance from the junction with the Main South Line at Gore: * Gore (0 km) * Croydon (7 km) * Otamita (12 km) * Mandeville (17 km) * Pyramid (24 km) * Riversdale (29 km), junction with the Waikaia (Switzers) Branch * Waimea (34 km) * Kingston Crossing (38 km) * Balfour (43 km) * St Patricks (50 km) * Lintley (55 km) * Lumsden (59 km), junction with the Kingston and Mossburn Branches Operation When the Waimea Plains Railway opened, New Zealand was slipping into the Long Depression and traffic justified trains only three days a week. As the Kingston Branch ran on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the Waimea Plains Railway ran on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. When the national economy improved in the 1890s, so did services on the line, and a passenger express ran from Kingston to Gore three days a week; this became known as the \\"Kingston Flyer\\" and a tourist service now replicates this on 14 kilometres of track between Kingston and Fairlight on the Kingston Branch. Although the preserved Kingston Flyer uses two AB class locomotives, the initial Flyers used K and V class engines. Passenger numbers declined in 1937 when regular services were withdrawn on the Kingston Branch north of Lumsden, and although the possibility of railcars was considered, the line's passenger services ceased on 17 September 1945. Like the Kingston Branch, the Waimea Plains Railway had regularly seen a significant number of passenger excursions on top of normal services throughout its history, and these continued for over a decade after 1945. 1956 was the last year passenger trains ran each way on the same day over the Waimea Plains, and the last excursions came during the next year's Easter holiday period. Freight trains initially operated out of Lumsden and ran five days a week until 1956. Services were re-organised to operate from Gore in 1959 and operated thrice- weekly. In 1930 and 1952, the line was not considered to be a branch and thus was not assessed in the branch line commissions of those two years, but in 1967, it was announced that its future was under review. The district negotiated a reprieve for three years, promising extra traffic, and DJ class diesel locomotives replaced steam locomotives on the line in January 1969, but less than 24,000 tonnes were carried annually and through trains ceased running in October 1970, replaced with two shunting services, one from Gore to Riversdale and the other from Lumsden to Kingston Crossing, leaving a 9 km gap of line unused, although the tracks were still in place and closure of most of the line came on 1 April 1971. A number of excursion trains ran on the line in its final weeks. Demolition of the line from Balfour back to Gore began in the later part of 1971. Although there were proposals to retain the line from Gore to Mandeville as an industrial siding to serve a proposed freezing works in the area, this proposal never eventuated and the line was lifted from Balfour all the way back to Gore. The last 2 km section of line from the junction points at Gore to the Gore Gravel and Crushing Company's plant was retained as an industrial siding until it too was closed on 1 October 1972. The 16 kilometres from Lumsden to a silo at Balfour remained open for the transport of wheat, but the quantity was not enough to justify the continued existence even of the truncated portion of the line, and it closed on 15 January 1978. Today Although both nature and human development have taken their toll on what remains of the railway, some remnants survive. Some of the formation has been destroyed by farming, but much of it can still be traced. Both goods shed and passenger shelter still stand at Kingston Crossing, while at the site of Waimea station two points levers are positioned by the old loading bank. Another loading bank exists at St Patricks, complete with a mounted nameboard. In Balfour, the sealed station platform is now a part of a children's playground, and in the former junction town of Lumsden, the station building is used as a tourist centre. The other junction station in Gore remains with a platform as a stop on the Main South Line between Dunedin and Invercargill, although its passenger service (The Southerner) ceased in 2002.

Early life  Wurm was born in Budapest, the second child to the German-speaking Adolphe Wurm and the Hungarian-speaking Anna Novroczky. He was christened Istvan Adolphe Wurm. His father died before Stephen was born. Both of his parents were multilingual, and Wurm showed an interest in languages from an early age. Attending school in Vienna and travelling to all parts of Europe during his childhood, Wurm spoke roughly nine languages by the time he reached adulthood, a gift he inherited from his father, who spoke 17. Wurm went on to master at least 50 languages. Career Wurm grew up stateless, unable to take the nationality of either of his parent or of his country of residence, Austria. That enabled him to avoid military service and attend university. He studied Turkic languages at the Oriental Institute in Vienna, receiving his doctorate in linguistics and social anthropology in 1944 for a dissertation on Uzbek. In 1946, he married fellow student Helene (Helen) Maria Groeger, a specialist in African ethnography. He taught Altaic linguistics at the University of Vienna until 1951. After reading some works by Sidney Herbert Ray, Wurm became interested in Papuan languages and began a correspondence with Arthur Capell, a lecturer in linguistics at the University of Sydney. Wurm began teaching himself Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu from books and took up a position in London. In 1954, the Wurms moved to Australia, where Capell had organised for Wurm a post in the Anthropology Department at the University of Sydney. In 1957, the Wurms moved to Canberra, where Stephen took up a post as Senior Fellow within the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS, now Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs) at the new Australian National University (ANU). The same year, the Wurms received Australian citizenship. From then on, the main focus of Wurm's research was the study of the languages of New Guinea, but he also carried out research on a number of Australian Aboriginal languages. At the Australian National University, he was Professor of Linguistics from 1968 to 1987. He was elected fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia in 1976.  Legacy  In tribute to the scholarship of the man, the journal Oceanic Linguistics titled an article on Wurm \\"Linguist Extraordinaire\\". In recognition of Wurm's outstanding contribution, the Stephen Wurm Graduate Prize for Pacific Linguistic Studies was inaugurated in 2008.

Description The island features numerous sandy beaches facing the Gulf of Mexico, as well as a park called \\"South Lido Park\\", which has a beach and a woodland trail. The island is well developed with a wide variety of luxury hotels and beach houses, and has a seasonal nightclub scene. While not as popular as Siesta Key Beach, Lido Key Beach is reviewed as a more private beach that is more relaxing for the tourists who come from around the world to visit it. Weddings and other private parties will often book a section of the beach for their guests. History In 1926, Lido Key opened to automobile traffic, the Lido Beach Casino opened, and John Ringling, Samuel Gumpertz, and Owen Burns built a $30,000 pavilion, dock, and bathhouses just south of where the Lido Beach park sits presently. However, by the 1950s, poor management resulted in the deterioration of the casino. It was demolished in 1969, and remodeled and modernized by 1970.

Jones produced several albums for Albert King (including I'll Play the Blues for You, The Blues Don't Change and I Wanna Get Funky), and became the producer and manager for the Bar-Kays. He produced all of their records including their last records for Mercury Records. He formed their production company, and produced other acts such as Kwick on EMI and executively produced Ebony Webb, also on EMI. Jones was also a successful songwriter, with his songs recorded by musicians including Elvis Costello, Sam & Dave, Clarence Carter, and Albert King. Songs he co-composed include \\"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\\", \\"Drownin' on Dry Land\\", \\"Heart Fixing Business\\", \\"If the Washing Don't Get You, The Rinsing Will\\", and \\"Hard to Handle\\". Jones started out as a bass player, and ended up owning his own recording studio, (Onyx) a.k.a American Recording Studio, in Memphis, Tennessee. He gave many artists and musicians opportunities to work in the recording industry, long before there were college classes on the music business. Jones knew a hit record and blossomed at Stax Records as a writer, producer and recording engineer. He lived to be in the studio and helped to make a name for Ardent Studios. He stayed in Studio A of Ardent for almost 10 years. He was the producer for Chocolate Milk's 1982 album, Friction.

Hamilton was born in High Point, North Carolina, the youngest of eleven children of a Methodist minister. Hamilton served during World War II in the United States Army. He began his service at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania training to be an engineer, but in preparation for the Normandy Invasion his unit (among others) was sent to Camp Claiborne, Louisiana to train as infantry. Hamilton was shipped with his unit to Europe where he was in combat with the 84th Infantry Division in France, the Netherlands and Germany in the Rhineland campaign, assault on the Siegfried Line and the Battle of the Bulge during which he was injured and returned to England for medical attention including to his frozen feet which caused him pain and problems for almost sixty years. Hamilton was discharged from the Army in 1945 and returned to North Carolina to resume his studies. He earned a B.A. cum laude from High Point College and a B.D. and Ph.D. from the Duke University Divinity School in 1954. That same year he was appointed as a professor at North Carolina State University where he also ran the YMCA. In 1955 Hamilton was appointed Dean of the College and Professor of Christian Thought at Kentucky Wesleyan College in Owensboro, Kentucky. In 1959 at age 35 Hamilton became president of the college. At the time Kentucky Wesleyan was in the midst of steep operating deficits and academic and enrollment problems. Under Hamilton's leadership the college improved its financial situation, quickly mounting operating surpluses, and also greatly increased its enrollment and bolstered its faculty with increased pay and benefits and the addition of many highly regarded new professors. Kentucky Wesleyan reached its peak enrollment during Hamilton's tenure. Successful fundraising also allowed for the construction of several new buildings on the campus; in one campaign Hamilton enlisted the students to raise $250,000 to build a new library, and they did. Hamilton also gave great attention to Kentucky Wesleyan's athletic programs and during his tenure the school, with its student body and athletic teams racially integrated somewhat ahead of many others, won its first few Division II basketball national championships (1966, 1968 and 1969) and established a program that is still today the most successful in Division II competition. In 1970, after eleven years as president at Kentucky Wesleyan, Hamilton accepted the presidency of Central Methodist College in Fayette, Missouri. Central Methodist, like Kentucky Wesleyan prior to Hamilton's arrival, faced declining enrollment, shaky finances and low morale. The 1970s were difficult times for small colleges across the United States and Central Methodist in particular entered the decade with a difficult financial future. Hamilton introduced new programs to attract new students, including organizing the Allied Health Consortium among various Missouri schools. Hamilton also tirelessly worked to build new ties between the college and Missouri's Methodist churches and to recruit new students. An office (using donated facilities procured by Hamilton) was opened in St. Louis to assist with school business and recruitment. Hamilton improved conditions for the school's faculty by installing telephones in their offices, instituting health insurance as part of their employment benefits, and raising faculty pay. Hamilton also established the school's first sabbatical program for faculty and made it a regular part of college affairs. He also instituted faculty evaluations, conducted by faculty and students. The curriculum was expanded and college governance was opened up, allowing for greater participation by more people and interests. Hamilton also established a nursing program which continued as an important part of the college long after his departure. Hamilton added new academic and athletic scholarships. In 1973 the school's rugby team finished third in the national championship tournament, and the first women's athletic teams at the college were established during Hamilton's term as president. Hamilton also arranged to have the tombstones of Daniel Boone and his wife returned to the college. Also while at Central Methodist, Hamilton was ordained as a Methodist minister. Hamilton left Central Methodist in 1976. He returned to Kentucky and served as Assistant State Treasurer for the state of Kentucky from 1976 through 1980 and as executive director of the Department of Corporations in the Kentucky Secretary of State's office in 1980. His later positions included Vice President for Development, Timken Mercy Medical Center, Canton, Ohio, 980 through 1983; president of the Deaconess Hospital Foundation, Evansville, Indiana, 1983 through 1984 (he was also assistant pastor at Aldersgate United Methodist Church in Evansville in that time), and vice president for planned giving for the Ohio Presbyterian Retirement Services Foundation in Columbus, Ohio from 1985 to his retirement. In 1963 and 1965 Hamilton returned to his alma mater, High Point College, to give the commencement address and to receive an honorary L.H.D. degree. He also twice studied at Oxford University in England. After battling heart problems, Hamilton died in Columbus, Ohio in 2003 and was buried with military honors at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. He was survived by his wife, four children, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Further Reading and Sources *Central Methodist College 1961-1986, Bartlett C.

The novels are written in a hard- boiled detective fiction style, with elements of traditional mystery and dialogue-based humor. Garrett, during his adventures in his home city of TunFaire and across Karenta and the Cantard, has to deal with elves, vampires, centaurs, trolls, and numerous mixed breeds, along with gods, wizards, witches and more. Unlike most fantasy series, the Garrett P.I. novels focus more on the detective aspects of the story and less on the magical. Background TunFaire is a large city in the kingdom of Karenta. It is home to an uneasy mix of humans, dwarves, elves, ogres, pixies, ratmen and various other races, along with numerous mixed breeds in seemingly endless combinations, with humans predominating. Corruption, poverty, crime and general lawlessness abound. Karenta has been involved in a generations-long war with the kingdom of Venageta over control of the Cantard, a region that houses most of the world's silver mines. (Silver is necessary for magic.) Male humans are subject to a mandatory five years of military service, which many do not survive (including Garrett's father and brother). However, anyone who can prove they are at least one quarter non-human is exempt. This is a source of much resentment, exacerbating racial tensions.

Garrett is an ex-marine with a knack for figuring things out. He is in his early 30s at the beginning of the series, 6'2\\" tall, with blond (or dirty blond) hair and blue eyes. He struggles to stay in shape due to his laziness and affinity for beer. Garrett survived his five years of mandatory military service as a marine in the ongoing war with Venageta. When he returned home to TunFaire, he began his freelance investigative service. Garrett avoids work as much as possible, doing just enough to make ends meet at the beginning of the series. However, he comes into a substantial fee at the end of Sweet Silver Blues, which allows him to buy a house (with a room for the Dead Man) and hire Dean as cook and housekeeper. He initially has one steady source of income, a retainer from Max Weider to keep the insider theft at the latter's breweries in check. Later (in Angry Lead Skies), he is given a small ownership share in the highly profitable Amalgamated Manufacturing Combine (for his efforts which lead to its formation). He is involved romantically with several women over the series, the most prominent being Tinnie Tate, with whom he has a tumultuous, on again-off again relationship. He has a self-declared preference for redheads. However, he ends up seriously involved with the Windwalker Furious Tide of Light at the end of Gilded Latten Bones. Garrett's weakness for beautiful women often results in him trying to rescue them from their troubles. Unlike his friend, Morley Dotes, Garrett has a conscience and avoids killing whenever possible, even when it would be sensible to do so. =Morley Dotes= Morley is a half-dark-elf assassin and entrepreneur who owns his own restaurant and bar, originally called The Joy House but later renamed The Palms. Morley has a reputation as being the best street fighter in TunFaire, and he suffers none of the pangs of guilt that Garrett does when dealing with his opponents. He is vain and conceited, a dedicated vegetarian and health nut who constantly chases after women, married or otherwise. With his charm and exotic good looks, he usually gets them, yet he still claims that Garrett has an easier time attracting young ladies than he does. Morley Dotes acts as a foil to Garrett in that killing does not bother him, as it does Garrett. In several of the novels, this difference is highlighted, not so much to shed light on or vilify Morley, but to expose Garrett's dark nobility. Morley and Garrett, despite their differences, are best of friends. As the series progresses, we see their friendship grow even stronger, although neither one would readily admit it. As Morley matures, he seems to take more of a role managing his restaurant and less of a role in the world of crime, although he is always up for an adventure with Garrett when the time comes. Morley Dotes first appears in Sweet Silver Blues. =Saucerhead Tharpe= \\"Saucerhead\\" Tharpe, given name Waldo, is a professional thug and bodyguard. He is a friend of Garrett and Morley, and his line of work lies somewhere between theirs‚Äîhe will beat people up for money, but will not kill for hire. He is a bit slow of thought, but has a deeply ingrained sense of nobility, and once he accepts payment for a job he will see it through or die trying. Physically, Saucerhead is a remarkably large and ugly human. He is much taller than Garrett's 6'2\\", incredibly strong, and almost impossible to kill. Though these qualities may imply a bit of ogre or giant blood in his background, Tharpe claims to be of pure human stock. Although he is typically attracted to small, feisty women, late in the series he falls for Garrett's friend Winger. Saucerhead Tharpe first appears in Sweet Silver Blues. =The Dead Man= Garrett's partner, known only as the Dead Man, is a member of a very rare species called the Loghyr. About four hundred years previous to Sweet Silver Blues, he is killed when stuck with a knife. However, the Loghyr spirit prevails long after death, so his minds (plural) are still functional, as are his formidable mental powers. Within a certain range of his corpse, the Dead Man is telepathic and telekinetic. He is able to communicate through direct mind contact, as well as read and control the minds of unwilling subjects. He can lift physical objects up to the size of a small person, perhaps larger. The full extent of his powers is uncertain, and Garrett suspects he can do far more than he normally lets on. The Dead Man is also a deductive genius, often helping Garrett solve cases, though he prefers to give limited advice and force Garrett to think for himself. He entertains himself by running military simulations, using \\"armies\\" of mind-controlled insects that go through maneuvers on the walls of his room. The Dead Man's body weighs about four hundred and fifty pounds and spends all its time in an oversized chair in Garrett's house. He is a little ragged around the edges where the vermin have pecked at him, but Loghyr flesh corrupts extremely slowly. Despite being dead, he does have to \\"sleep\\" from time to time, apparently abandoning his body for weeks and even months at a time while he rebuilds his energy. The Dead Man and Garrett are friends as well as business partners. Garrett has been known to refer to the Dead Man as Chuckles, Smiley, Old Bones, and His Nibs. The Dead Man first appears in Sweet Silver Blues. =Dean= Dean Creech is Garrett's housekeeper and cook. Dean is elderly, around 70 years old, and he watches the house while Garrett is away. Dean dislikes cleaning the Dead Man's room, and is somewhat unnerved by the presence of the Dead Man. Dean is generally critical of Garrett's lady friends, with the exceptions of Tinnie Tate and Maya Stump, whom he adores. Dean acts as a sort of loving but harsh wife/mother to Garrett. He cooks and cleans, and snipes and grumbles about how much Garrett is or is not working, how he is eating, who he consorts with, or how late he sleeps in the morning. Dean hopes that Garrett will someday settle down with one of his many spinster nieces. Dean first appears in Bitter Gold Hearts. =Tinnie Tate= Tinnie Tate is Garrett's on-again off-again girlfriend. She is a short, fiery redhead in her mid 20s with long, straight hair, green eyes, a few freckles, and an attractive body. She lives in the Tate family compound with her cousin, Rose Tate, and her uncle, Willard Tate, among others. Her relationship with Garrett is often strained by Garrett's promiscuity, but when push comes to shove, Garrett and Tinnie truly love each other. A marriage between the two is a possibility, although each is ready for such a commitment. Tinnie Tate first appears in Sweet Silver Blues. In Cruel Zinc Melodies, Garrett introduces Tinnie as his fianc√©e (primarily to stop her from insulting an attractive sorcerer from the Hill who is showing an interest in Garrett), without talking it over with her first. Though Tinnie criticizes Garrett for this later, they avoid a discussion about it until the end of the book. At the beginning of the subsequent novel Gilded Latten Bones, Tinnie and Garrett have been living together some time without marriage. However, their relationship is strained because Garrett feels that Tinnie is excessively controlling his life. They agree to have Tinnie's mind modified (by the Dead Man) to rid her obsession for control. Their relationship goes through an informal breakup and the modification is aborted. =Playmate= Playmate is a black man close to seven feet tall, though Garrett often exaggerates his height as closer to nine feet. He also has colored scars on his face. Despite his fierce appearance, he does not have a mean bone in his body. Playmate owns a stable close to Garrett's house, and he often provides horses and carriages to Garrett when he needs them. Garrett thinks Playmate would make an excellent preacher, but Playmate's dedication is to his stable, first and foremost. Playmate first appears in Sweet Silver Blues. =Winger= Winger is a country bumpkin turned thug-for- hire. She is tall (roughly Garrett's height) and attractive, though strong and built like a brick outhouse. Garrett likens her to Saucerhead, but with better teeth and long blonde hair. Winger is impulsive with a penchant for schemes that get her and everyone around her into hot water. Her taste in clothing is atrocious, and she is something of a kleptomaniac. She has about as much of a conscience as Morley Dotes. Garrett and Winger have a history. Garrett is not entirely sure why he and Winger are friends, but they are, and he counts Winger as one of the few people who would rise up to defend him under any circumstances. Winger first appears in Dread Brass Shadows. =Chodo Contague= Chodo Contague is the Kingpin of the Outfit, TunFaire's organized crime syndicate. He rose to the position following the assassination of the previous Kingpin, which came at the end of Sweet Silver Blues and is orchestrated by Morley Dotes. Although he is about 60 years old and wheelchair-bound by an unspecified condition, Chodo is still a very menacing figure; there is a ruthlessness about him that makes even his henchmen seem kind by comparison. As head of the Outfit, he is one of the most powerful men in TunFaire. Due to several of Garrett's actions in the first few novels of the series, Chodo feels that he owes him a number of favors. Being a mafia don, Chodo has his own personal sense of loyalty and respect, but at the same time, Chodo only favors Garrett as long as their goals coincide. At the end of Dread Brass Shadows, Chodo suffers a stroke that seemingly turns him into a vegetable. At the end of Whispering Nickel Idols, he is on the road to recovery. Chodo Contague first appears in Bitter Gold Hearts. =Crask and Sadler= Crask and Sadler are Chodo Contague's bodyguards and right hand men. They are cold, ruthless killers who follow Chodo's directions to the letter, and both are vicious fighters on a par with Saucerhead Tharpe and Morley Dotes. Although Crask and Sadler often team up with Garrett on raids and stakeouts, it is always an uneasy truce between the parties. Crask and Sadler would as soon kill Garrett as help him if Chodo Contague gave the order. In Dread Brass Shadows, Crask and Sadler turn against Chodo Contague and, with the aid of Garrett and Winger, they attempt to assassinate him. When Chodo suffers a stroke, Crask and Sadler take over as heads of the Outfit, under the pretense that Chodo is still giving them orders. At the end of Red Iron Nights, Belinda Contague snatches power back from Crask and Sadler, and the two flee TunFaire. Crask and Sadler first appear in Bitter Gold Hearts, and they die at the end of Faded Steel Heat. =Belinda Contague= Belinda Contague is the daughter of Chodo Contague. She has black hair, very pale skin, and prefers to wear all black clothing. Despite her choice of attire, she is very attractive. Belinda suffers from conflicting emotions. Part of her wishes to be normal, so she could be carefree and spend time with Garrett, for whom she has a tender spot in her heart. However, for the most part, she is just as ruthless and cruel as her father. Although she confesses to Garrett often that she wishes she could get rid of this part of herself, she knows well enough that she never will. Belinda Contague first appears in Red Iron Nights. By Faded Steel Heat, she has secured control over the Outfit in her stroke-incapacitated father's stead, and remains its queenpin from that point onward. =Westman Block= Westman Block is first the Captain, then Colonel of the city Watch. Unlike previous, corrupt heads of the Watch, Block is a true champion of law and order, and along with Deal Relway, he establishes the Guard, an offshoot of the Watch that governs the TunFaire secret police. Block can usually be found at the headquarters of the Watch, in the Al-Khar. By the time of Gilded Latten Bones he has become General of the renamed Civil Guard. Westman Block and Garrett have a mutual respect for one another, although they are not necessarily friends. Block is often willing to overlook some of Garrett's more unseemly actions in exchange for his help in solving difficult crime cases plaguing TunFaire. Westman Block first appears in Red Iron Nights. =Deal Relway= Deal Relway, referred to simply as Relway, is a pioneer and advocate of a New Order, where law, order, and justice will reign supreme. He starts out working for the Watch and quickly works his way up to being the Director of the TunFaire secret police. By the later novels in the series, Garrett fears that Relway's influence is starting to approach that of Chodo Contague's, just on a different side of the law. The relationship between Relway and Garrett is tenuous, at best. Relway is what is known in TunFaire as a \\"unique\\", meaning that his ancestry can be traced back to several different races of humanoid. He is short, ugly, and easily overlooked, particularly when in disguise. Deal Relway first appears in Red Iron Nights. =Pular Singe= Pular Singe is a ratgirl, renowned as being the best tracker in the city of TunFaire. She is incredibly smart for her species (making her a little smarter than the average human), speaking Karentine (though she has a problem with sibilants) and learning how to read and write. She has a voracious appetite and has a great fondness for stewed apples. She has a huge crush on Garrett, though it seems to have ended. Some ratpeople clans, hers included, list family name first, so her actual given name is Singe. Garrett, though he has no interest in Singe romantically, enjoys having her around, as she is a huge help in his cases and she constantly amazes Garrett with her ability to learn and mature. She lives in his house and maintains his accounts along with other duties. Pular Singe first appears in Faded Steel Heat. Minor recurring characters =Rose Tate= Rose Tate, daughter of Willard Tate and cousin to Tinnie Tate, is a red-haired beauty, short but well-built. She is also cruel and self-serving, with a shrewish temperament. Garrett and Rose do not particularly get along, but Morley and Rose appear to have a tryst in Sweet Silver Blues. Rose Tate first appears in Sweet Silver Blues. =Willard Tate= Willard Tate is the patriarch of the Tate Shoe Company and a cobbler at the very peak of his trade. He is old and bent with the weight of years, but he has a powerful will and a shrewd business sense. The Tates, who tend to be short and claim a hint of elvish in their blood, are master craftsmen who have worked hard to become one of the wealthier families in TunFaire. The Tates, a very large, extended family, live in an enormous compound that is part home, part factory. In Angry Lead Skies, Willard Tate helps fund a manufacturing project spearheaded by Garrett. Willard Tate first appears in Sweet Silver Blues. =Maya Stump= Maya Stump was an abused child whom Garrett took under his wing. She becomes a member of the Sisters of Doom, a street gang made up exclusively of abused girls when children. In Cold Copper Tears, she is the warchief of the Doom, but resigns in exchange for the gang helping Garrett during a case. Garrett and Maya are good friends, and Maya is one of the few women Dean approves of as a match for Garrett, although he is uncertain due to her age. Maya eventually breaks off her and Garrett's relationship because Garrett is unwilling to commit to her. In Cruel Zinc Melodies, it is mentioned that Maya has settled down and gotten married. Maya Stump first appears in Cold Copper Tears. =Max Weider= Max Weider started from nothing and founded a vast brewing empire that supplies TunFaire and is one of its wealthiest residents. Garrett once stopped insider theft serious enough to threaten the business and was then put on permanent retainer to check around every now and again. Max suffers the loss of much of his family in Faded Steel Heat, and dotes on his surviving daughter, Alyx. Max Weider is mentioned throughout the series, but he makes his first appearance in Faded Steel Heat. =Linda Lee= Linda Lee is an attractive librarian and friend of Garrett's who works at the Royal Library. She is just over five feet tall, with brown hair and big brown eyes. Although there is some attraction between the two, Linda mainly just helps Garrett when he is in need of historical information. Linda Lee first appears in Deadly Quicksilver Lies. =Glory Mooncalled= Glory Mooncalled is a mercenary general, initially serving the Venageti, but he is treated so badly that he switches sides. Eventually he turns rogue and seeks to establish his own republic in the Cantard. The Dead Man is fascinated by Glory Mooncalled, and he often tries to predict Mooncalled's next move by playing wargames in his room using hordes of small bugs as markers for Mooncalled's forces. Although Glory Mooncalled is referenced throughout the series, he only makes a brief appearance in Faded Steel Heat. =John Stretch= John Stretch, whose given name is Pound Humility, is Pular Singe's half-brother. Although he and Garrett start out on the wrong foot, John Stretch helps out Garrett in his later cases. John Stretch is a community leader of the rat people, and has the unique ability to get into the heads of ordinary rats, communicate with them, see and smell what they do, as well as possibly control them. John Stretch first appears in Angry Lead Skies. Geography and locations =TunFaire= TunFaire is the capital of the kingdom of Karenta. It is a large, sprawling city, home to people and creatures of all types. Some of the areas of TunFaire include: *Wizard's Reach: The area in which Garrett's house is located. *The Hill: Where the major sorcerers, wealthy individuals, and war leaders of TunFaire live. *The Bustee: The poorest and most dangerous neighborhood in TunFaire. *The Safety Zone: An area where species can intermix without fear of prejudice, created by Morley Dotes and home to The Joy House. *The Dream Quarter: Home to the major churches and chapels of TunFaire. *The Tenderloin: A mafia-controlled red light district where anything can be purchased for the right price. *The Dead Zone: The political area of the city. The Joy House (The Palms) The Joy House is a bar and restaurant in the Safety Zone, owned and operated by Morley Dotes. Morley's henchmen can often be found working the bar. The establishment serves only vegetarian and non-alcoholic fare. Morley lives in an apartment suite on the second floor, reached by a set of stairs near the bar; a speaking tube allows the bartender to communicate with him. In Petty Pewter Gods, Morley decides to renovate the Joy House, turning it into The Palms, a more upscale establishment that caters to TunFaire's elite. The Bledsoe Infirmary An imperial charity, the Infirmary is supposed to provide medical care for the indigent population of TunFaire. Due to lack of funding, few patients at the Bledsoe receive any medical attention at all. The Bledsoe is also the city's insane asylum. It has been said that the poor conditions are not as much due to financial problems but the corrupt administration. The hospital workers even make money by providing the insane patients for home entertainments. The Al-Khar The Al-Khar is an old, decrepit building that serves as the main jail in TunFaire. It is also the headquarters for the city Watch. =Karenta= Karenta is the kingdom in which TunFaire is located. Karenta has been at war with another kingdom, Venageta, for over a hundred years. Part way through the series, this war will abruptly end, leading to unrest in the city of TunFaire. =The Cantard= The Cantard is a huge geographical region eight hundred miles to the south of TunFaire. The Cantard contains the majority of the world's silver mines (in Garrett's world silver is a necessary material for the working of magic), which has led to a generations-long war between Karenta and Venageta. Most of the countryside is desert, while the coastal fringe is hemmed by swampy islands. Law and Disorder =The Watch= The Watch is the police force of the city of TunFaire. The Watch is notoriously slow to respond to incidents and is extremely corrupt. Later in the series, the Watch undergoes a major overhaul as Westman Block and Deal Relway take over, turning it into a well-oiled machine for law and order over the course of a few novels. Block and Relway are supported in their efforts by Prince Rupert, bringing further legitimacy to the unit, which is renamed the Civil Guard by the time of Gilded Latten Bones. =The Outfit= The Outfit is a name for the organized crime syndicate in TunFaire. Although the individual in charge of the Outfit changes over the course of the series, the Outfit as a whole always retains significant power. The Outfit owns the entire Tenderloin, and they have business ventures in various other parts of the city, as well. Races =Intelligent= *Breeds - individuals of mixed racial backgrounds; short for half-breeds. *Centaurs *Dwarves *Elves *Fairies *Grolls - a mixture of troll and giant. *Humans *Loghyr - an extremely rare race of long-lived humanoids with advanced mental powers including telekinesis, telepathy, and mind control. *Ogres *Pixies *Ratkind - large rat people created by sorcery; they perform many of the city's menial jobs. *Shapechangers *Trolls *Vampires =Semi-Intelligent= *morCartha - a small, winged, semi-intelligent race that mainly live in the rainforests up near Thunder Lizard country. =Animals= *Mammoths *Rocs *Thunder Lizards - Dinosaurs by another name, found in abundance in the wilderness. Sometimes kept as guard beasts, or hunted for their thick hides, which make good boot-leather. *Unicorns - wildly divergent from the usual mythological unicorns in fiction, these are aggressive, carnivorous beasts, possibly created by sorcerers much as are the ratmen. They run in herds under a single dominant male, and hunt using trained dogs. *Thunder Lizards - similar to dinosaurs, ranging in size from small to several stories tall, they feature prominently in the series both as protectors of the Contague estate as well as supplying hide for the Tate family business. Allusions =Allusions to other works= *The characters from this series parallel characters from the Nero Wolfe series: **Garrett parallels Archie Goodwin **The Dead Man parallels Nero Wolfe **Dean parallels Fritz **Tinnie Tate parallels Lily Rowan **Morley Dotes may be named in honor of New York District Attorney Dick Morley. *There are also similarities to the Travis McGee series by John D. MacDonald: **Garrett parallels Travis McGee **The book titles follow naming conventions: All McGee books reference a color (e.g. The Deep Blue Good-by and Dress Her in Indigo), while all Garrett book titles include an adjective, metal, and a plural noun (e.g. Sweet Silver Blues through Gilded Latten Bones). *Garrett is named in honor of Randall Garrett, best known as the author of the Lord Darcy stories. =Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science= *According to Glen Cook, TunFaire is loosely modeled after St. Louis, Missouri.. *The character names Tama Montezuma and Marengo North English appear on exit signs 191 and 216 along Interstate 80 in Iowa. . =Allusions in other works= *An \\"investigator from TunFaire\\" is mentioned in Wm Mark Simmons' The Dreamland Chronicles. Garrett's ladies As with many other stories of this type, the main character is a bit of a ladies man, and frequently loves the women he interacts with on his cases. Throughout the series, his list of girlfriends has added up to quite a few: *Kayean Kronk - Garrett's first love, rescued in book 1 although their relationship was long past *Tinnie Tate - Longtime on- and-off girlfriend, beginning in book 1 (Sweet Silver Blues), though it's not until book 3 (Cold Copper Tears) that the relationship becomes explicitly defined. Became engaged to Garrett in Cruel Zinc Melodies, but by Gilded Latten Bones they realize she's more obsessed than in love, and break up again. *Amiranda Crest - Only appearance in Bitter Gold Hearts - Killed after one night with Garrett. *Amber daPena - Only daughter of Stormwarden Raver Styx - Bitter Gold Hearts *Maya Stump - Introduced in Cold Copper Tears, but dumped Garrett by Red Iron Nights. *Eleanor - A sad encounter in Old Tin Sorrows, now memorialized in a painting Garrett keeps in his office. *Jennifer Stantnor - Only appearance in Old Tin Sorrows. Their relationship didn't work out. *Winger - A friend with benefits, introduced in Dread Brass Shadows. *Belinda Contague - Mentioned in Dread Brass Shadows, first appearance in Red Iron Nights.

He most recently served as an offensive advisor for the Dallas Renegades of the XFL. Previously, Mumme served as the head football coach at Iowa Wesleyan College, Valdosta State University, the University of Kentucky, Southeastern Louisiana University, New Mexico State University, McMurry University, and Belhaven University. Mumme is known for being one of the founders of the air raid offense. Playing career A native of San Antonio, Texas, Mumme played football as a receiver for Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas, Texas, going on after graduation\\"A Look at 'Air Raid' Hal Mumme Football,\\" Scout.com, December 30, 2004. to play at New Mexico Military Institute and at Tarleton State University. While an undergraduate, he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. Coaching career Mumme's coaching career began as the offensive coordinator at Foy H. Moody High School in Corpus Christi, Texas from 1976 through 1978. In 1979, he was the head coach at Aransas Pass High School. Mumme was an assistant coach (quarterbacks and receivers) under Bill Yung at West Texas State University in 1980 and 1981, offensive coordinator also under Yung at UTEP from 1982 through 1985, and head coach at Copperas Cove High School from 1986 through 1988. During his time as a high school and college assistant coach Mumme developed an unorthodox, pass-oriented offensive attack that proved very successful at moving the ball, gaining yardage and scoring points. The unusual attack, utilizing short passes to multiple receivers and backs out of the backfield, allowed Mumme's teams to compete against more talented and athletic opponents. BYU head coach LaVell Edwards was a major influence on Mumme's offensive strategy. =Early career= In 1989, Mumme became head coach at Iowa Wesleyan College. While finishing 7‚Äì4 in his first season, he eventually led the team to the national quarterfinals in 1991, the first playoff appearance in the school's history. Mumme's 1990 team led the nation in passing offense and the 1989 and 1991 squads finished second nationally in that category. Mumme finished at Iowa Wesleyan with a 25‚Äì10 record and was the NAIA District Coach of the Year in 1989 and 1991. Mumme took over as head coach at Valdosta State University in 1992. Mumme's record at Valdosta State was 40‚Äì17‚Äì1. In both 1994 and 1996 he led the team to the NCAA Division II playoff quarterfinals; Valdosta State had never made the playoffs previously. The team was consistently ranked in the Division II top 20 and was ranked #1 in the nation in Division II for part of the 1996 season when they won their first Gulf South Conference championship. In 1994 Valdosta State defeated the University of Central Florida 31‚Äì14, an upset over the team picked by Sports Illustrated in the preseason to win the NCAA Division I-AA national football championship. Quarterback Chris Hatcher won the Harlon Hill Award as player of the year in NCAA Division II football. =Kentucky= On December 2, 1996 the University of Kentucky announced that it had hired Mumme to replace Bill Curry as head coach of its football program.1997 Kentucky Football Media Guide, p. 140. Kentucky had gone 9‚Äì24 (.273) through the prior three years.Kentucky Historical Scores1997 Kentucky Wildcats Football Media Guide, p. 209. In Mumme's first year the team improved to a 5‚Äì6 record. The season highlight was a win over #20 Alabama,September 29, 1997 AP poll at AP Poll Archive 1997 Kentucky Wildcats Football Media Guide, pp. 168, 209. a team Kentucky had not beaten since 1922.1997 Kentucky Wildcats Football Media Guide, pp. 205‚Äì209. Led by sophomore quarterback Tim Couch, Kentucky's offense set multiple school, SEC and NCAA records.1999 Kentucky Wildcats Football Media Guide, pp. 172‚Äì181. In 1998 Kentucky won its season opener against Louisville at the christening of Papa John's Cardinal Stadium by the lopsided score of 68‚Äì34. Kentucky improved to 3‚Äì0 with wins over Eastern Kentucky University and Indiana and was ranked #25 in the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll.1999 Kentucky Wildcats Football Media Guide, p. 164. Losses to #8 Florida and at #22 Arkansas followed. Kentucky then defeated South Carolina and #21 LSU. A close loss to Georgia on a missed last-second field goal was followed by victories over eventual SEC West champion Mississippi State and Vanderbilt. At 7‚Äì3 and ranked #25 in the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll, Kentucky then lost its regular season finale at Tennessee. Tim Couch was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy. Kentucky then played in the Outback Bowl, Kentucky's first New Year's Day bowl in 47 years.1999 Kentucky Wildcats Football Media Guide, p. 169. Despite jumping out to a 14‚Äì3 lead, Penn State won 26‚Äì14. Couch elected to forgo his senior season and enter the 1999 NFL Draft, where the Cleveland Browns selected him with the #1 overall pick. In 1999 Kentucky finished the regular season 6‚Äì5 before losing the 1999 Music City Bowl to Syracuse, 20‚Äì13. Season highlights included victories over #20 Arkansas, LSU, South Carolina, Vanderbilt and Indiana. The 2000 Wildcats dropped to 2‚Äì9, with victories against only South Florida and Indiana. Press reports detailing a growing investigation into NCAA rules violations cut the legs out from under the team, and they lost their final eight games. In early 2001, Mumme resigned amid numerous NCAA rules violations, largely payments to recruits. The team was eventually found to be in violation of more than three dozen recruiting violations. His former recruiting coordinator, Claude Bassett, was deemed the worst offender. Bassett had been forced to resign in 2000 for giving gifts to prospects and writing papers for them, and was slapped with an eight-year show-cause penalty, which effectively blackballed him from the collegiate ranks until 2009.http://espn.go.com/page2/tvlistings/show87transcript.html As a result, they were banned from post-season play in 2002 and lost 19 scholarships over the next three seasons. Mumme, however, was not given any individual sanctions. He was replaced by his offensive line coach Guy Morriss. Mumme's final record at Kentucky was 20‚Äì26, after a 20‚Äì18 start and an 18‚Äì17 record in his first three years, compared to Kentucky's 9‚Äì24 mark in the three years before his arrival. =Southeastern Louisiana= After a hiatus of 18 months Mumme returned to football as the 12th head coach for the Southeastern Louisiana Lions in Hammond, Louisiana. The school had terminated its football program in 1985 but decided to compete again and did so in 2003 at the NCAA Division I-AA level. The team finished its first season 5‚Äì7 and posted a 7‚Äì4 mark in 2004. The program posted a 51‚Äì17 win over #6 McNeese State and entered the Top 25 in the national I-AA rankings. Southeastern Louisiana ranked first among NCAA Division I-AA teams in total offense per game (537.1 yards) and passing offense per game (408 yards) in 2003.Southeastern Louisiana University Lions football coaching records =New Mexico State= In December 2004 Mumme was named the head coach at Division I-A New Mexico State University, replacing Tony Samuel. Samuel had run an option offense at the school and the transition to Mumme's passing offense was difficult. New Mexico State finished 0‚Äì12 in Mumme's first season (2005). Entering the 2006 season Mumme's career record as a Division I head coach was 32‚Äì49. In the first game of the 2006 season, Mumme's New Mexico State team beat his former team, Southeastern Louisiana, 30‚Äì15. The 2006 New Mexico State squad went on to post a 3‚Äì9 record for the season, and for part of the season, led all Division I-A football programs in total offense and passing offense. New Mexico State finished 4‚Äì9 in 2007. While the coach at New Mexico State, Mumme was the subject of a lawsuit brought by four Muslim NMSU players and the ACLU, who claimed that Mumme subjected them to a hostile work environment on account of their religion. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, when NMSU agreed to pay a sum of $165,000 to the four players. Neither Mumme nor NMSU admitted to any wrongdoing in the case. Mumme was fired on December 1, 2008 after finishing 3‚Äì9 during the 2008 season, including 7 consecutive losses to end the season. He was replaced by former UCLA defensive coordinator DeWayne Walker. =McMurry= Mumme was hired by Division III McMurry University on April 12, 2009. After an 0‚Äì10 season in 2008, Mumme led McMurry to a 4‚Äì6 season in 2009 and improved to 6‚Äì4 in 2010 which was the first winning season for McMurry football since 2000. In 2011 Mumme led McMurry to a record of 9-3 which included an NCAA Division III playoff appearance, the first playoff appearance for McMurry since 1980. McMurry won their first ever playoff game against Trinity 25-16 before losing in the second round to ASC rival University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. The season also included a victory over NCAA Division I UT-San Antonio and archrival Hardin-Simmons. For the 2012 season McMurry switched to NCAA Division II, the first game of that season being with the Abilene Christian University Wildcats in Shotwell Stadium, (which McMurry lost 51-0). The 1971 game that the Abilene Christian Wildcats won by 53 to 20 had been the last in an old rivalry which had Abilene Christian leading with 24 victories 15 losses 0 ties. =Belhaven= On January 17, 2014, NAIA school Belhaven University announced Mumme as its new head football coach. Mumme inherited a team that had gone 3‚Äì8 the year before. In the 2014 season the Blazer football team went 2‚Äì9, going winless in Mid-South Conference play. During his second season in charge, Belhaven moved to NCAA Division III. In the first year as an NCAA school, Mumme led the team to a 2‚Äì8 record, with two wins coming in their new conference, the American Southwest Conference. The team finished the 2016 season with the same record as the previous season, 2‚Äì8, with wins in the opening and final game of the year. =Jackson State= On December 17, 2017, Mumme joined Jackson State as offensive coordinator. After only three games into the 2018 season, he announced his resignation \\"to pursue other professional opportunities\\"; at the time, the 1‚Äì2 Tigers were averaging 13.6 points per game. =Dallas Renegades= In November 2018, Mumme joined the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football in November, but left the team after less than two weeks. On May 16, 2019, Bob Stoops hired Mumme as the offensive coordinator for the Dallas Renegades of the XFL. During a game on March 1, 2020, Mumme was injured in a collision with a player on the sideline, prompting Stoops to promote offensive line coach Jeff Jagodzinski to offensive coordinator, though Mumme remained with the team as an advisor. Personal life Mumme was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early 2009; the cancer was reportedly caught early and his prognosis is good. His wife, June, is a breast cancer survivor and is active with the Susan G. Komen Foundation.Former UK Coach Mumme Has Cancer Yahoo Sports, February 3, 2009 Mumme has two daughters and a son, Matt, who is the offensive coordinator for Nevada Wolf Pack.

Biography Booker emerged in the late 1980s as a prominent urban contemporary R&B; artist and producer. He began recording music after being signed by his godfather, Barry White, to his production company in 1984. Later, he played keyboards with the short- lived Epic Records band Tease for three years. Booker, known throughout the industry as a keyboard player, is considered by his music peers to be a bass player. Booker received his recording contract in an unlikely manner. He gave his demo tape to the manager of Gerald Albright to showcase his skills as a musician, but had forgotten about the songs on the other side of the tape that contained original songs with his vocals. As a result, he was offered a recording contract with Atlantic Records. Booker signed a recording contract with Atlantic to release his debut album Chuckii in 1989 in which he played all the instruments and sang all vocals. The album fared well on the strength of hit singles \\"(Don't U Know) I Love U\\" and the #1 R&B; single \\"Turned Away\\". The follow-up final album Niice 'N Wiild was released in 1992 and yielded another chart-topping R&B; hit \\"Games\\". Chuckii also wrote, performed and produced the single \\"Crypt Jam\\" from the CD soundtrack Tales from the Crypt. Booker also made a cameo in the movie House Party 3 as a piano player in the hotel lobby scenes which starred Kid N' Play, Bernie Mac and Chris Tucker. Booker produced for several recording artists throughout the years, including Troop, which yielded two #1 singles (\\"All I Do Is Think of You\\" & \\"Spread My Wings\\"), his godfather Barry White, Janet Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Kool & the Gang and many more. He was the musical director, producer and keyboardist for Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour as well as the opening act. Booker got the gig after he was invited by Jackson to the premiere of her long-form video Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. Although Booker went to the premiere to mingle with celebrities, he was caught off guard when Jackson asked him after the screening to be her musical director for the tour. In the mid- to late '90s, Booker was also the music director and keyboardist for TLC and their CrazySexyCool tour as well as New Edition Home Again Tour and Faith Evans on her \\"Keep The Faith\\" U.S. tour. He was the pianist for Tina Turner for her Wildest Dreams Tour in 1997, replacing Kenny Moore, who succumbed to a heart attack during the tour. Booker was also involved with one of the biggest R&B; tours of 2008 as musical director with Mary J. Blige on her \\"Heart Of The City\\" tour alongside Jay-Z as co-headliner. Chuckii also served as musical director for acts such as Tevin Campbell, Chante Moore, Brownstone and recently, Keyshia Cole. In recent production, Booker was one of the producers for Lionel Richie's album Coming Home released in 2007 as well as producer and arranger for Richie's Collection of Holiday Classics album for NBC, Sounds of the Season. Booker has carved a sizeable niche for himself as a record producer for artists such as Lalah Hathaway, Troop, En Vogue, Angela Winbush, Diana Ross, Anastacia, Commissioned, Lionel Richie, and Bette Midler. Personal life Chuckii comes from a vast musical background family which includes his uncle, a jazz flautist and his grandmother, who is a gospel pianist. His mother, Selestiine Booker, has played and recorded with such Gospel artists as James Cleveland and Norman Hutchins - Booker attended the Pasadena Art Center College of Design on a scholarship program specializing in Graphic Arts. He is known to have one of the most extensive comic book collections ranging from popular Marvel and DC comics to obscure paperback novels. He was co-owner of the private recording and mixing studio Aire L.A. Studios in Glendale, California.

History Top Buzz were originally formed in 1988 by MC Patrick Jarrett (\\"Mad P\\"), DJ Mikee B and DJ Jason Kaye. All originate from areas in north London, Tottenham and Enfield respectively. They were one of the first to popularise the darker sounds of jungle techno as it began to emerge from the hardcore rave sounds from 1991. The band released the Livin' in Darkness EP on Basement Records in 1992, which encapsulates much of the flavour of the era.

A distinct feature was the ragga MCing of MC Patrick, strongly influenced by Jamaican dancehall. Patrick often referred to the team as \\"Two Blacks and a Bubble\\", a reference to their ethnic origins, with 'bubble' referring to Bubble and Squeak, the Cockney rhyming slang for Greek (Jason K is a Greek Cypriot).

It first aired on January 6, 2006, and was released on VHS and DVD on January 31\\\\. The film was the highest rated program on cable for the week with 5.4 million viewers. Plot For his school assignment, Josh must write an essay on the greatest adventure of his life, to which he struggles to think of anything fun or fufilling he has ever done. Drake is frustrated at his band manager for booking him and his band inappropriate gigs at boring venues, so Josh offers to become his new manager, using this experience to write his essay, which Drake reluctantly accepts. When their parents, Audrey and Walter, leave to go on a ten-day cruise, Drake and Josh drive their sister Megan to the airport to visit her friend Jessica in Denver, Colorado. However, Drake and Josh accidentally put Megan on the wrong flight to Los Angeles, California. Megan is angry at the boys for putting her on the wrong flight, but uses Walter's credit card to book a limousine service and a luxurious stay at the Chambroulay Hotel, which she comes to enjoy. When Drake and Josh fly to LA to find Megan and keep an eye on her, Josh meets a music producer in the hotel bathroom while playing one of Drake's songs on his laptop. The producer decides to book Drake an appearance on TRL for the next day. However, Josh finds out that his G.O. (an MP3 player) was accidentally replaced on the flight with that of Milo McCreary, containing blueprints for counterfeit money. When McCreary and his companion Brice Granger confront Drake and Josh on the G.O., the boys attempt to escape, driving around LA in a Viper stolen from Tony Hawk. When they think they have lost them, Drake and Josh get pulled over by FBI agents. But, the two \\"cops\\" actually turn out to be two more bad guys who work for McCreary and Granger. The criminals kidnap Drake and Josh and take them to a warehouse, locking them away. Back when Drake and Josh were at the San Diego airport, Josh had watched the news about some crooks who stole a monetary printing press from the U.S. Treasury Department three days before. Josh figures out that McCreary and Granger stole the printing press to forge counterfeit money. After making $500 million, the crooks plan to drown Drake and Josh in a lake. Meanwhile, Megan is disappointed at Drake and Josh abandoning her again and initially enjoys her free time in peace, but soon becomes concerned about them when she finds Granger's wallet in her hotel room. The following morning, she has her limo driver take her to the warehouse, where she finds Drake and Josh. She tries to alert the Los Angeles Police Department, but the phone connection goes out. Therefore, she sneaks into the warehouse and turns on the large fan, which blows around all of the money. In all of the ensuing chaos, Drake and Josh finally escape and battle the crooks in large fight until the police come and arrest the crooks for counterfeiting money. Megan uses some of the money she acquired from the warehouse to help her get to Denver, giving a portion as a tip to the limo driver. As a reward for capturing the crooks, the police offers to give Drake an escort to Sunset Studios for his TRL appearance using Tony Hawk's Viper, which Hawk's manager gives them permission to use because Hawk has three more Vipers. Drake and Josh arrive at TRL in time, where Drake performs his new song, \\"Hollywood Girl\\". After his performance, the producer tells Drake he will pull some strings to allow him to audition for Spin City Records in New York City. With success in Drake's hands and Josh finally having something to write about for his greatest adventure, Drake and Josh cruise around and enjoy LA with two girls who have become fans of Drake's music during his TRL performance.

That u and v are periods of a function ∆í means that :f(z + u) = f(z + v) = f(z)\\\\, for all values of the complex number z. The doubly periodic function is thus a two-dimensional extension of the simpler singly periodic function, which repeats itself in a single dimension. Familiar examples of functions with a single period on the real number line include the trigonometric functions like cosine and sine. In the complex plane the exponential function ez is a singly periodic function, with period 2œÄi. As an arbitrary mapping from pairs of reals (or complex numbers) to reals, a doubly periodic function can be constructed with little effort. For example, assume that the periods are 1 and i, so that the repeating lattice is the set of unit squares with vertices at the Gaussian integers. Values in the prototype square (i.e. x + iy where 0 ‚â§ x < 1 and 0 ‚â§ y < 1) can be assigned rather arbitrarily and then 'copied' to adjacent squares. This function will then be necessarily doubly periodic. If the vectors 1 and i in this example are replaced by linearly independent vectors u and v, the prototype square becomes a prototype parallelogram that still tiles the plane. The \\"origin\\" of the lattice of parallelograms does not have to be the point 0: the lattice can start from any point. In other words, we can think of the plane and its associated functional values as remaining fixed, and mentally translate the lattice to gain insight into the function's characteristics. If a doubly periodic function is also a complex function that satisfies the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations and provides an analytic function away from some set of isolated poles ‚Äì in other words, a meromorphic function ‚Äì then a lot of information about such a function can be obtained by applying some basic theorems from complex analysis. * A non-constant meromorphic doubly periodic function cannot be bounded on the prototype parallelogram. For if it were it would be bounded everywhere, and therefore constant by Liouville's theorem. * Since the function is meromorphic, it has no essential singularities and its poles are isolated. Therefore a translated lattice that does not pass through any pole can be constructed. The contour integral around any parallelogram in the lattice must vanish, because the values assumed by the doubly periodic function along the two pairs of parallel sides are identical, and the two pairs of sides are traversed in opposite directions as we move around the contour. Therefore, by the residue theorem, the function cannot have a single simple pole inside each parallelogram ‚Äì it must have at least two simple poles within each parallelogram (Jacobian case), or it must have at least one pole of order greater than one (Weierstrassian case). * A similar argument can be applied to the function g = 1/∆í where ∆í is meromorphic and doubly periodic. Under this inversion the zeroes of ∆í become the poles of g, and vice versa. So the meromorphic doubly periodic function ∆í cannot have one simple zero lying within each parallelogram on the lattice--it must have at least two simple zeroes, or it must have at least one zero of multiplicity greater than one. It follows that ∆í cannot attain any value just once, since ∆í minus that value would itself be a meromorphic doubly periodic function with just one zero.

It stood in the Asakusa district of City of Tokyo (now Tait≈ç, Tokyo) from 1890 until its demolition following the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923. The , as it was affectionately called by Tokyoites, was Tokyo's most popular attraction, and a showcase for new technologies. It housed Japan's first electric elevator. History The Ry≈çunkaku quickly became a landmark and symbol of Asakusa after its opening in 1890. It was a major leisure complex for visitors from all over Tokyo. When the 1894 tremor weakened the structure, it was reinforced with steel girders. However, the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 destroyed the upper floors, and damaged the whole tower so severely that it had to be demolished. Architecture and technology The Ry≈çunkaku was designed by Scottish engineer W. K. Burton in the late 1880s, not long after his arrival in Japan. It was a tower of red bricks over a wood frame, in renaissance revival style. All twelve floors had electric lighting. The two electric elevators were designed by Ichisuke Fujioka, a founder of Toshiba. They served the first through eighth floors, and could carry up to 10 persons each. However, for safety reasons, they were shut down after only half a year of operation. Building uses The Ry≈çunkaku's second through seventh floors held 46 stores selling goods from around the world. A lounge was on the eighth floor, and art exhibitions were held on the ninth floor. The tenth through twelfth floors were observation decks from which all of Tokyo could be seen, and on clear days, Mount Fuji. Many artistic and cultural events were held in the Ry≈çunkaku, including Western music concerts, geisha photograph exhibitions, and beauty contests. A well-known store was the place where wood-block prints were made for Sugoroku, a popular Japanese board game. The Ry≈çunkaku in literature As the Ry≈çunkaku's fame spread, it appeared in the works of contemporary authors such as Tanizaki Junichiro, Ishikawa Takuboku, Kitahara Hakushu and Kaneko Mitsuharu. The edifice's opening was commemorated in Ogawa Kazumasa's most famous work, Types of Japan, Celebrated Geysha of Tokyo in Collotype and From Photographic Negatives Taken by Him, published around 1892.http://www.baxleystamps.com/litho/ogawa/ogawa_geysha.shtml Ry≈çunkaku with Jintan billboard Trivia *To celebrate the sunrise on New Year's Day, 1891, balloons with telephone tickets and tower tickets were released from the Ry≈çunkaku top floor.

It discontinued military operations on 1 November 1999 as a result of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which specified that US military facilities in the former Panama Canal Zone be closed and the facilities be turned over to the Panamanian government. The airport is located six miles southwest of Balboa, at the southern (Pacific) end of the Panama Canal. Most of the area around it was uninhabited and formed part of the Panama Canal Zone watershed, although Panama City could be reached by crossing the nearby Bridge of the Americas. After demilitarization, the facility reopened as Panam√° Pac√≠fico International Airport in 2014. Overview For over 50 years, Howard Air Force Base was the bastion of US air power in Central and South America. In its heyday, it was the center for counter-drug operations, military and humanitarian airlift, contingencies, joint-nation exercises, and search and rescue. It boasted fighters, cargo planes, tankers, airborne warning and control aircraft, operational support airlift \\"executive\\" jets, and search and rescue helicopters. It was also home to a host of transient U.S. Army and U.S. Navy aircraft. Personnel assigned to tenant commands at Howard AFB tracked drug traffickers from South America, and its cargo aircraft, primarily rotational Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft from the active duty U.S. Air Force, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, provided theater airlift for United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) contingencies, exercises, and disaster relief, and conducted search and rescue in the vast region. Only a portion of the transports, several special-mission C-130s, two C-27 Spartan aircraft, and executive jets belonged to the host unit, the 24th Composite Wing, later redesignated the 24th Wing. Although Regular Air Force C-130 aircraft rotated to Howard AFB for 90-day detachments in the 1970s and early 1980s in the support mission called CORONET OAK, this mission was later transferred to the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, which then provided C-130s for VOLANT OAK.I was the detachment commander there Vought A-7 Corsair II and later General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters also rotated through Howard AFB. History Carved out of the jungle 500 yards from the Pacific Ocean, Howard Air Base opened in 1942. It was named after Major Charles H. Howard (1892‚Äì1936), who flew in Panama in the late 1920s. The only five-star general in Air Force history, Henry H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold played a prominent role in the history of Howard AFB and military aviation in Panama. As a captain, Arnold led the first air unit, the 7th Aero Squadron, to the Isthmus on March 29, 1917. Within a week, he left for Washington, DC, and more pressing duties there. When he returned to Panama in May 1939, he was a major general and chief of the Army Air Corps. The purpose of his visit was to select a site for a new air base. He chose what is now Howard AFB and suggested the name Howard Field, in honor of Major Charles H. Howard, a personal friend and former subordinate who had served in Panama during the period 1926‚Äì1929 and who had been part of Arnold's crew on his famed flight of B-10 bombers to Alaska in 1934. Major Howard died in an air crash on October 25, 1936. On December 1, 1939, the new air base officially became Howard Field. Construction began shortly thereafter and the first troops arrived on May 15, 1941. Howard Field hosted both fighter and bomber aircraft during the World War II era. The base was inactivated on January 1, 1950 and its real estate turned over to the Army. The Air Force continued to use Howard as a deployment site for joint training exercises during the 1950s, and by December 1961 all USAF flying operations in Panama relocated to Howard. On October 1, 1963, the Air Force officially reclaimed Howard from the Army and the base played a central role in US military operations in Latin America ever since, largely due to its 8500-foot runway and its status as the only jet-capable US air field south of the Rio Grande. Control of the Panama Canal changed hands on 31 December 1999, from the United States to Panama. Department of Defense elements began drawing down more than a year earlier, in anticipation of the deadline established by the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977. The last of the fixed-wing US aircraft departed Howard Air Force Base on 1 May 1999. On 1 November 1999, the 24th Wing inactivated and Howard Air Force Base was turned over to the Panamanian government.

This style is probably best known as one element of the flatpicking style in bluegrass music, and it closely resembles a banjo roll, the main difference being that the banjo roll is fingerpicked rather than flatpicked. A typical element of the technique is the use of three pitches played repeatedly within a four-pulse rhythm. This results in a continual shifting of the pitches vis- a-vis the accented pulse. The three pitches are usually played on three adjacent strings‚Äîone per string. The pick direction can vary, depending on the required emphasis and the melody. Forward \\"roll\\" on G (DDU) Using \\"D\\" for down\\" and \\"U\\" for \\"up\\" (and slashes to indicate groups of three), mandolin player Jesse McReynolds used a crosspicking roll of :D - U - U / D - U - U / D - U . . . creating a repeating pattern of notes that expresses the melody. Guitarist George Shuffler used a pick pattern of :D - D - U / D - D - U / D - D . . . . The traditional banjo roll form is :D - D - U / D - D - U / D - D . . . this helps to accentuate the \\"threes\\" nature of the pattern against the \\"four\\" rhythm. The other way is using strict alternate picking: :D - U - D / U - D - U / D - U. . . . This may be more comfortable for players who are using alternate picking for most of their playing. In actuality, one (or more) of the three pitches may be varied from one repetition of the pattern to the next, for instance the top note could be toggled up and down one step. Mandolin McReynolds was the earliest exponent of the crosspicking bluegrass style on the mandolin. He developed his crosspicking style with his brother in the band Jim & Jesse. McReynolds influenced later mandolin players such as Sam Bush. Guitar George Shuffler introduced crosspicking to the acoustic guitar; Shuffler developed the technique as a \\"fill\\" for back-up and leads while playing with the Stanley Brothers. Among the most well-known crosspickers are Doc Watson and Clarence White, whose styles influenced other guitarists, including Tony Rice. Among rock guitarists, King Crimson Robert Fripp has made cross-picking a signature technique,Baldwin, Douglas (November 2007). \\"Guitar Heroes: How to Play Like 26 Guitar Gods from Atkins to Zappa\\", edited by Jude Gold and Matt Blackett, Guitar Player, p.111. which has influenced many other guitarists, particularly in progressive rock.: Fripp teaches the technique to his students in Guitar Craft.

The mall opened on August 29, 1990 and has three anchor stores: Bass Pro Shops, Dillard's, and Target. A 10 unit food court on the upper level of the mall features restaurants such as Subway and Sbarro. The food court features a double-decked animal-themed carousel. History When opened in 1990, Savannah Mall was expected to succeed Savannah's older Oglethorpe Mall. Savannah Mall was considered upscale and featured stores exclusive to the market like Blockbuster Music, Abercrombie & Fitch, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, United Colors of Benetton, and The Disney Store. Belk and J.B. White opened with the mall. Parisian and Montgomery Ward opened in 1991. Montgomery Ward's building was slated for Jordan Marsh, but plans for this were canceled when the chain folded. Montgomery Ward pulled out of the mall in 1998 when the company began struggling. Also that year Dillard's acquired J.B. White and retired the JB White name. Parisian and Belk both left the mall in early 2003. At this point, many stores were leaving the mall and by 2005, there were more than 20 vacancies, with some stores relocating to Oglethorpe Mall, and others exiting the Savannah market altogether. In August 2003, Bass Pro Shops opened in the space vacated by Parisian. Target opened its first Savannah area store in the mall in October 2004. Target demolished the Belk building to construct a new, two-level building. Target occupies the second level, and Burlington Coat Factory re-entered the Savannah market with a location on the first floor in 2006. Steve & Barry's opened in 2004 in the former Montgomery Ward. A.C. Moore opened as a junior anchor in 2007. In 2008, the mall's owners undertook multimillion-dollar renovations with improvements focused on energy conservation, lighting and additional ADA access. The mall also received a new logo and modern features like Wi-Fi internet access. Today As of 2020, the mall has a handful of local businesses and about 10 national chain stores such as Hibbett Sports, Sbarro, and Victorias‚Äôs Secret. However, most of the mall is vacant. Texas Roadhouse relocated out of the mall in 2019. Similarly, in early 2020 Burlington relocated to a nearby vacant Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us. A.C. Moore closed with the rest of the company.

By his second wife, Mary Stackpoole, his father has two other sons William and Thomas, who both achieved distinction. McMahon was commissioned into the 44th Foot, and later transferred to the 48th Foot and the 87th Foot. He served as a Member of Parliament for Aldeburgh from 1802 to 1812. He was Paymaster of Widows Pensions in 1812. He was Keeper of the Privy Purse, Auditor of the Duchy of Cornwall, and Secretary to the Duke of Cornwall. A proposal that he receive a salary of ¬£2,000 as Private Secretary was rejected by Parliament in 1812. McMahon was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1812, and died in 1817, having been made a Baronet shortly before his death.

High school career Jenkins had an outstanding prep career while playing for Hueneme High School in Oxnard, California, and he garnered much national attention during his senior season. On November 9, 1995, he set the national record for most yards rushing in a single gamehttp://usfootballnet.com/links/content.asp?x=1&syn;_st=0&syn;_c=,117&syn;_g=&syn;_a=&syn;_l=1&syn;_loc=,state&syn;_t=3,1&syn;_curr=11&printable;=true during a 52-34 victory over Rio Mesa High School. Jenkins carried the ball 30 times for 619 yards and 7 touchdowns. The previous record of 608 yards had been set by John Bunch in Arkansas in 1974. Jenkins' total shattered the California state record of 507 yards, set by David Dotson of Valley View High School in 1991. The national record stood until 2006, when Paul McCoy of Matewan High School rushed for 658 yards in a single game. College career Jenkins was heavily recruited by many schools across the country, but chose to play at Brigham Young University because BYU had shown interest in him long before his record-breaking single-game performance. His freshman season with the Cougars (1996) was impressive: he rushed for 733 yards and scored a team- high 14 touchdowns (including 11 rushing TDs) despite being a backup to Brian McKenzie the entire season. He also led the Cougars in kickoff returning; for his efforts, he was named WAC Freshman of the Year.http://www.byucougars.com/Profile.jsp?ID=1585 With help from Jenkins, BYU beat Kansas State University in the Cotton Bowl Classic and finished the year with a 14-1 record, becoming the first team in the history of Division I-A football to win 14 games in a season. In the off-season, BYU suspended Jenkins for violating the school's honor code. He was forced to sit out the entire 1997 season, but returned as BYU's full-time starter at tailback in 1998. He was the Cougars' top offensive weapon that season, rushing for 1,307 yards (at the time, the second-highest total in school history). He also totaled 15 touchdowns, which tied for the second-highest total in school history. He was named to the 1998 All-WAC 2nd Team. In a 46-43 victory over San Jose State, Jenkins rushed for 250 yards (the second-highest total in BYU history) and scored 5 touchdowns, which tied a school record. In 1999, Jenkins was again disciplined by BYU for violating the honor code. Because it was a second offense, he was expelled from the school.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1998/12/25/jenkins_expelled/ He transferred to Northern Arizona University. He played one season for the Lumberjacks, but made a big impact while he was there. He rushed for 1,051 yards and 7 touchdowns, and added 67 receptions for 716 yards and 10 touchdowns.http://recruiting.scout.com/a.z?s=73&p;=8&c;=1&nid;=292857 For his efforts, he was named to the All-Big Sky 2nd Team. Professional career Jenkins entered the NFL in 2000 as a rookie free agent. He joined the San Diego Chargers and almost immediately became the team's top kickoff returner. In his rookie season, he set franchise records for most kickoff returns (67) and most kickoff return yards (1,531), eclipsing totals set by Andre Coleman in 1995. He returned a kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown against the New Orleans Saints in Week 2, and was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In 2001, he was even better. He averaged 26.6 yards per kickoff return, leading the entire NFL in that category. He totaled 1,541 yards in kickoff returns,http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/stats?playerId=2427 which broke the team record he had set in 2000. In a game against the Oakland Raiders, he totaled 250 yards in kickoff returns, which set another team record. In the game, he had a 93-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and added a 67-yard return to start the second half. Jenkins also had an 88-yard touchdown return against the Denver Broncos, and added a 72-yard return against the Buffalo Bills. He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for October 2001, and was chosen as an alternate for the AFC's Pro Bowl team. Jenkins was limited by injuries in 2002, but still managed to return 40 kickoffs for 925 yards (an average of 23.1 yards per return). In just three seasons, Jenkins had become the Chargers' all-time leader in kickoff return yards with 3,997. In 2003, Jenkins signed a free agent contract with the Raiders. In the 2003 season, he was again limited by injuries (a severe ankle sprain). He played in just seven games, returning 25 kickoffs for 553 yards. When the Raiders needed to clear space on their roster for the addition of veteran quarterback Rob Johnson, they decided to waive Jenkins. Jenkins spent the 2004 off-season with the Saints, but was waived by the team before the regular season began. In September 2004, he signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. He saw limited action in his first season in the CFL; in five games, he rushed 11 times for 50 yards and caught 4 passes for 30 yards. He did not see much action in his second season, either: he rushed 11 times for 84 yards and added 3 receptions for 13 yards. The Stampeders released Jenkins in September 2005.

It was developed by John Hawkesworth and starred Anthony Andrews as Lieutenant Brian Ash, an officer in the Royal Engineers (RE). The series chronicles the exploits of the fictional 97 Tunnelling Company,The tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers in World War I were numbered 170-185 and 250-258. Seven of them (170-173 and 178-180), were revived in 1939-1940, serving on Malta and Gibraltar, but not in bomb disposal. which has been made a bomb disposal unit, and specifically 347 Section of the company, to deal with the thousands of unexploded bombs (\\"UXBs\\") in London during the Blitz. As with all his fellow officers, Ash must for the most part learn the techniques and procedures of disarming and destroying the UXBs through experience, repeatedly confronted with more cunning and deadlier technological advances in aerial bomb fuzing. The series primarily features military storylines, though among them is a romantic thread featuring an inventor's married daughter, Susan Mount (Judy Geeson), with whom Ash falls in love, and other human interest vignettes. The programme was partly based on Unexploded Bomb - The Story of Bomb Disposal, the memoirs of Major A. B. Hartley, MBE, RE; its episodes were written by Hawkesworth and four screenwriters. The series was filmed in 1978 in and around the Clapham, Streatham and Tooting areas of south London.Hartley (1958), p. 272 Lt. Col. E. E. Gooch, RE (AER), rtd. was the technical adviser. The programme appeared on the US PBS as a segment of Masterpiece Theatre from 4 January to 5 April 1981.

Books Hartley's book, a non-fiction memoir of technical information and anecdotes, provided some of the major story developments. Danger UXB, a novel based on the series and written by Michael Booker, was published by Pan Books in 1978, and an annual was published by World Distributors in 1980. A non- fiction book titled Danger UXB by Melanie Jappy was published in 2001 by Macmillan. It was based on the two-part Channel 4 documentary series Danger Unexploded Bomb (15-22 February 2001), rather than the drama series. Production Many of the bomb-disposal scenes were filmed in what appeared to be deep, freshly dug holes lined with wooden shoring (the way real bomb disposal often happened). In fact, these scenes were shot using two different physical sets intercut: a short above-ground wooden fence that appeared to be the top of the shaft down to the bomb (but was not in fact excavated); and a 30-foot above-ground hollow wooden tower with a muddy area inside at the bottom (often shot from above, looking down). A side of the bottom was also removable to facilitate \\"bottom-of-shaft\\" close-ups. Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations References * oclc 6456857. *Salmon, Gregor (2012). Navy Divers.

Circus magnate John Ringling purchased the St. Armands Key property in 1917 and planned a development which included residential lots and a shopping center laid out in a circle. As no bridge to the key had yet been built, Ringling engaged an old paddle-wheel steamboat, the \\"Success,\\" to service as a work boat. John Ringling financed the construction of a bridge connecting the key to the mainland and became the first person to drive across it in 1926.  St. Armands Circle  St. Armands Key features a large traffic circle with a small park in the center. The traffic circle is known as St. Armands Circle or \\"The Circle.\\" The area is largely commercial, containing more than 130 stores and restaurants. The circle contains many restaurants, tobacco shops, clothing stores, and other retail outlets. The Circle also features a statue walk that features works originally purchased by John Ringling.

Born in New Orleans, Louisiana at his family's home located at 319 Bourbon Street, he batted and threw right- handed. Lafitte pitched for the Georgia Institute of Technology baseball team in 1906 and 1907. He also was a starter in the first intercollegiate basketball game ever played by Georgia Tech. He made his debut with the Detroit Tigers in 1909. After an 11-8 season with the 1911 Tigers, Lafitte told manager Hughie Jennings that he wanted to leave early the following season to resume dental school. Jennings told him if he left early to keep on going. Lafitte did. He became a dentist, but also pitched in the Federal League. He returned to baseball in 1914 as a member of the Brooklyn Tip-Tops of the fledgling Federal League. That season he became the first pitcher to throw a no-hitter without throwing a shutout in a 6-2 victory over the Kansas City Packers on September 19. In 1914, he split his final season between the Tip-Tops and the Buffalo Blues. He served in the U.S. Army during both World Wars. Baseball helped him earn a degree in dentistry, and he practiced dentistry for 42 years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, retiring in 1961.

Since the pirate Jean Lafitte's life span was c.1776-c.1823, it is not possible that Ed Lafitte was his descendant. It is unknown if they were more distantly related.

She was the first actress who played Alice Kramden in The Honeymooners with Jackie Gleason and earlier, during the 1930s, was a prominent comedic supporting and leading actress in Hollywood films such as Bed of Roses and The Bowery. She performed in a dozen Broadway productions between 1925 and 1968. However, her career was interrupted in the 1950s as a result of blacklisting, leading to her departure from The Honeymooners. Early life Pert L. Kelton was born in 1907 in Great Falls, Montana.

Both of her parents were travelling song-and-dance performers in vaudeville; and her aunt, Jane Kelton, was also a professional actress in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In fact, it was her Aunt Jane who is credited with giving Pert her unusual name. According to Kelton family history, Jane suggested the name to Pert's mother while reminiscing about her career and describing her favorite theatrical role, that of the character \\"Pert Barlow\\" in a play called Checkers.\\"Who's Who in the Cast: Pert Kelton\\", Playbill, March 1958, a cast profile included in preview for The Music Man, which premiered at the Majestic Theatre, New York, N.Y., December 19, 1957.

Upon her return to the United States with her family, Pert was enrolled in private schools for her early formal education and for extensive training in dance, voice, and drama. By age 12, after appearing for a while with her parents as \\"The Three Keltons\\", she began appearing as a solo act or \\"single\\" in vaudeville; and by age 17 she was performing on Broadway, initially as a cast member in Jerome Kern's 1925 musical comedy Sunny, starring Marilyn Miller.\\"Inside the Playbill: Come Blow Your Horn‚ÄîOpening Night at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre\\", profile of Pert Kelton in Playbill, February 1961.

Films Pert and her parents had moved to California to work in Hollywood films by the latter half of 1927. Her first credited movie role there was as the character Rosie in First National Pictures' 1929 release Sally, a production based on the Broadway hit by the same name. With regard to the Kelton family's living arrangements in this period, the federal census of 1930 documents that Pert was residing in Los Angeles at the \\"Warner-Kelton Hotel\\", later called the Hotel Brevoort (and Tropical Gardens) and sharing room 666. That same census identifies all three of the Keltons as employed actors in \\"motion pictures\\". Pert was a young comedienne in A-list movies during the 1930s, often portraying the leading lady's wisecracking friend. She had a memorable turn in 1933 as dance hall singer \\"Trixie\\" in The Bowery alongside Wallace Beery, George Raft, Jackie Cooper, and Fay Wray. Directed by Raoul Walsh, the film is based on the story of Steve Brodie, the first man who reportedly jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge in 1886 and lived to brag about it. Kelton at one point in the film sings to a rowdy, appreciative crowd in an energetic dive, using a curious New York accent to good comedic effect, with Beery and Raft arguing afterwards over her attentions. In Gregory LaCava's 1933 pre-Code comedy Bed of Roses, Kelton plays Minnie, a witty prostitute who is a partner in crime with Lorry, portrayed by Constance Bennett. The two women in the plot are fond of getting admiring men helplessly drunk before robbing them, at least until getting caught and tossed into jail. Kelton has all the best lines, surprisingly wicked and amusing observations that would never be allowed in an American film after the Hollywood Production Code was adopted. Nevertheless, in 1933 her performance in Bed of Roses was widely praised by critics in leading newspapers and trade papers.Green, Abel (1933). \\"Bed of Roses\\", review, Variety, July 4, 1933, p. 16.

After her appearance in the 1939 film Whispering Enemies, she redirected her career, returning again to theatre and to performing increasingly on radio and later on the rapidly expanding medium of television. She did not return to the \\"big screen\\" until 1962, when she was cast as Mrs. Paroo in The Music Man. Radio and return to New York By April 1940, Pert had left California and was living in New York City again, sharing a $65-per-month apartment in Manhattan on West 55th Street with three other women, two of whom were employed as dancers in the theatre and the third as a secretary.\\"The Sixteenth Census of the United States: 1940\\", enumeration date April 23, 1940, Manhattan Borough, New York County, New York. FamilySearch. Retrieved September 6, 2017. A federal census taker canvassing Manhattan that year concisely identified Kelton in his enumeration ledger as \\"Actress, Theatre & Movies\\" and recorded her given age as only 28, although in the spring of 1940 Pert was actually 32 years old. If not a mistake in documentation, it is possible that Kelton herself, feeling the pressures to maintain a youthful profile within the image-conscious realm of entertainment, \\"shaved\\" a few years off her age when answering census questions at that time. Her documented lack of consistent employment during the previous year may be indicative too of the professional pressures she was experiencing after her film career in Hollywood began to wane in the late 1930s. According to the United States Census of 1940, Kelton was employed for only six weeks during the entire year of 1939, a total time of employment far less than the weeks worked by her roommates over the same period. Once Kelton had resettled in New York during the early 1940s, she began to work in theatre again, and she became a familiar voice on radio as well, performing on programs such as Easy Aces, It's Always Albert, The Stu Erwin Show, and on the 1941 soap opera We Are Always Young. Later, In 1949, she did the voices of five different radio characters on The Milton Berle Show. She was also a regular cast member of The Henry Morgan Show; and in the early 1950s, she performed the role of the tart maid in the Monty Woolley vehicle The Magnificent Montague.  Television  Kelton appeared in Henry Morgan's Great Talent Hunt, first aired January 26, 1951, hosted by Henry Morgan, and with Kaye Ballard, Art Carney, and Arnold Stang. Kelton was the original Alice Kramden in The Honeymooners comedy sketches on the DuMont Television Network's Cavalcade of Stars. These sketches formed the eventual basis for the 1955 sitcom The Honeymooners. Jackie Gleason starred as her husband Ralph Kramden, and Art Carney as their upstairs neighbor Ed Norton. Elaine Stritch played Trixie, the burlesque dancer wife of Norton, for one sketch before being replaced by Joyce Randolph. Kelton appeared in the original sketches, generally running about 10 to 20 minutes, shorter than the later one-season half-hour series episodes and 1960s hour-long musical versions. However, she abruptly was dropped from her role because of being blacklisted and she was replaced by Audrey Meadows. Rather than acknowledge that she was blacklisted, her producers explained that her departure was based on alleged heart problems. In his book The Forgotten Network, David Weinstein wrote Kelton remained on Cavalcade of Stars through the final season of the series (1951-1952), and suggests that it may have been because Jackie Gleason had resisted attempts at having her dropped. Kelton performing with Phil Silvers in a 1963 CBS comedy special In the 1960s, Kelton was invited back to Gleason's CBS show to play Alice's mother in an episode of the hour-long musical version of The Honeymooners (also known as The Color Honeymooners), with Sheila MacRae as a fetching young Alice. By this time, the original age discrepancies were reversed, with Ralph married to a much younger Alice than himself. In 1963, Kelton appeared on The Twilight Zone, playing the overbearing mother of Robert Duvall in the episode \\"Miniature.\\" The next year she guest-starred on the popular family sitcom My Three Sons. In this episode \\"Stage Door Bub\\", Kelton portrays Thelma Wilson, a veteran itinerant stage actress who longs for a settled domestic life but soon realizes that that lifestyle is actually ill-suited for her personality.\\"Stage Door Bub\\", My Three Sons, S04E24, originally broadcast February 27, 1964.

Broadway  In her 1925 Broadway debut in Sunny, Kelton had played the character Magnolia and performed a song with the same title as the play. Years later, she was twice nominated for Tony Awards: in 1960, as Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Musical) for Frank Loesser's Greenwillow; and in 1967-1968, as Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Dramatic) for Spofford. Her most memorable Broadway role, however, was her portrayal of the impatient Mrs. Paroo, the Irish mother of the town librarian Marian Paroo (Barbara Cook), in Meredith Willson's The Music Man, which premiered at the Majestic Theatre in New York in December 1957. She reprised her Broadway character in the film adaptation of The Music Man in 1962.  Hotel owner  Pert Kelton was part owner of the Warner-Kelton Hotel, built in the late 1920s, at 6326 Lexington Avenue in Los Angeles, Pert and her parents resided in the hotel during the late 1920s until at least 1930.. (A February 20, 1928, article in the Standard-Examiner (Ogden, Utah) incorrectly identifies the hotel as the Walton-Kelton Hotel.) The hotel catered to actors, poets and musicians such as Cary Grant, Orry Kelly, Rodgers and Hart, Monroe Salisbury, Sadakichi Hartmann, and later, Elizabeth Short. The building had a small outdoor theater, in a garden to the south, with a wishing well that may have inspired the song \\"There's a Small Hotel\\" from the musical On Your Toes (1936). It also housed a speakeasy in the basement. A sign above the hotel entrance reads \\"Joyously Enter Here\\". It later was the home of the California Television Society.

Background In 2004, Moore left Epic Records because of creative differences, so she and the label released this album and her greatest hits album The Best of Mandy Moore to end her contract. Moore was reportedly displeased with both albums because they had songs from her first two albums she has disowned since that period of her career. The compilation and The Best of Mandy Moore did not receive any promotion or participation from Moore and did not chart on the Billboard 200 albums chart at all.

Its buildings at No. 627 Canton Road, at the junction of Public Square Street, were erected in 1922Brief Information on Proposed Grade II Items, pp.211-212 after relocation from the junction of Public Square Street and Shanghai Street. The station closed on 22 May 2016 (except for the reporting centre, which will remain open to the public). A new station of the same name opened on that date at No. 3 Yau Cheung Road. History Yau Ma Tei Police Station was built in 1922. Additions were made after World War II, including a 1957 extension wing to serve as barracks and an accommodation block, to the west of the existing station. During the 1966 riots the police station was attacked by a mob but the police managed to suppress it rapidly. Architecture The neoclassical Main Block is built in Edwardian Free Style. There is a traditional portico on both sides of Canton Road and Public Square Street.Film Services Office: Yau Ma Tei Police Station The main entrance is a semi-circular portico set in the indented corner at the junction of Public Square Street and Canton Road. Such indented corners are features often used for feng shui reasons. Conservation status On 18 December 2009 the building was classified as a Grade 2 historic building. Part of the new wing which was constructed in 1950's is proposed to be underpinned as part of the reprovisioning works associated with the construction of the three-laned Central Kowloon Route in order to retain the structure of the existing structural form for the benefit of future generations. The original building has a large side gate opening onto Public Square Street, to the right of the main entrance. This gate has been permanently locked since at least the late 1970s, because opening is deemed unlucky after a number of shooting incidents involving officers who left the station via the gate. In one corner of the compound there is a small shrine to ward off the bad fung-shui which some believe to be created by the adjacent Gascoigne Road Flyover. In the wake of growing heritage conservation awareness following the demolition of the Star Ferry Pier in Edinburgh Place, lawmakers are threatening to block funding of the project. Cultural appearances The Yau Ma Tei Police Station is the location of a scene of the 2001 film Rush Hour 2. However, because the scene called for an explosion, the real filming had to be done in a movie studio, where wires and other special effects could be used. The station was also featured in the 2007 TVB programme On the First Beat. It was used multiple times for shots of the canteen, locker rooms, and other locations.

Ikki is the Phoenix Bronze Saint and older brother of Andromeda Shun. Although he initially appears as the first antagonist that the main characters must defeat, he later becomes a powerful ally. Character outline =Personality= In terms of personality, Ikki is almost the opposite of his younger brother, Shun, and his fellow Saints. Ikki is a loner, cold and harsh. When he first appears in the manga, fellow Saint Wolf Nachi points out that it is hard to believe Ikki and Shun are related due to the differences in their personalities. However, after the \\"Black Saints\\" arc, it is revealed that underneath his rough exterior lies a compassionate and kind soul. Kanon, in the \\"Poseidon\\" arc and Pandora, in the \\"Hades\\" arc, note that Ikki is still guided by his deep love and loyalty for his younger brother, for his friends and for Athena. Although he dislikes teamwork, he comes to battle whenever Athena's Saints need his help and often arrives at critical moments to save his younger brother and friends from certain death. He has a noble, complex and mature character, who never hesitates to sacrifice himself for his friends. =Abilities= The Phoenix Cloth represents the constellation of Phoenix, which is associated to the immortal bird that is reborn from its ashes found in the folklore and mythologies of diverse cultures. Reflecting this association, the Cloth has the ability to reform itself if pulverized and possibly change into a new form as it does so ‚Äì other Cloths require a great amount of a Saint's blood to repair. Ikki himself is extraordinarily resilient and hard to kill. On several occasions throughout the story, he returns from death and it is implied that every time he does so, he receives a boost in strength. Having been born under the sign of Leo, Ikki also dons the Leo Gold Cloth on one occasion, during the fight against Thanatos, the god of death, in Elysion. While Ikki is ranked as a Bronze Saint, his potential places him above most Silver Saints. His strength is common knowledge among his peers and fellow Bronze Saints. As a child, Ikki was known as the toughest of the one hundred orphans recruited by the Graude Foundation and would often defend his younger brother, Shun. During his battle against Virgo Shaka, Ikki awakens his seventh sense, which places him at the same level as a Gold Saint in terms of power. In the \\"Hades\\" arc, he also awakens the eighth sense, which allows him to descend to the world of the dead without being subject to its laws. Appearances =In Saint Seiya= In order to take revenge on Mitsumasa Kido, the head of the Graude Foundation who had Ikki endure a living hell of rigorous training on Death Queen Island to become a Saint since an early age, Ikki interrupts the Galaxian Wars tournament to steal the Sagittarius Gold Cloth from the Graude Foundation and challenges the other Bronze Saints to fight him and the Black Saints. After a long series of struggles, Pegasus Seiya, Andromeda Shun, Cygnus Hy≈çga and Dragon Shiry≈´ eventually defeat them. Overcoming his grudge, Ikki begins to assist the Bronze Saints in their fights to protect Athena and retake Sanctuary from Gemini Saga. His intervention is crucial in defeating the Gold Saint Virgo Shaka and Saga himself. In the \\"Poseidon\\" arc, Ikki aids the Bronze Saints by defeating Lyumnades Ca√ßa and battling Sea Dragon Kanon. Although he is unable to beat Kanon, Ikki succeeds in extracting valuable information from the Marine General about Poseidon that led to Athena's victory over the god of the Sea. Ikki does not appear in the \\"Hades\\" arc until the Saints are already in the Underworld. He defeats Garuda Aiacos and then confronts Hades himself, who had gained possession of his younger brother's body. Ikki attempts to rip the god out of Shun's body, and is punished for it with death. Not even the god of the Underworld could keep the Phoenix down, however, and Ikki eventually travels to Elysion where he participates with the other Bronze Saints in the battles against Thanatos, Hypnos and Hades. =In other media= Ikki as seen in the Saint Seiya anime, wearing the anime-only first version of the Phoenix Cloth. Ikki reappears in Saint Seiya: Next Dimension, the ongoing canonical sequel and prequel to Saint Seiya authored by Kurumada that deals with the aftermath of the war against Hades. After Athena visits Mount Olympus to meet her sister Artemis and ask for her help to cure Seiya from the curse Hades inflicted on him, Andromeda Shun is attacked by Artemis's soldiers, the Satellites, and their commander Lascomoune. Shun manages to defeat the Satellites, but not Lascomoune, who nearly takes his life. Ikki then intervenes to protect his brother and defeats the commander of the Satellites. Afterwards, he follows Athena and Shun into the past, to the war against Hades that took place in the eighteenth century. Ikki is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of the Leo successor to Aiolia, from the Gold Saint of the eighteenth century Leo KaiserSaint Seiya Next Dimension volume. 10 cap.70 He also appears briefly in the spin-off manga Saint Seiya Episode.G authored by Megumu Okada, as Leo Aiolia and Scorpio Milo think of the next generation of Saints who will write future history. Several minor changes were made to Ikki's design in the anime adaptation of the series. The Phoenix Cloth, which is orange in the manga, appears as multicolored in the anime adaptation. Ikki's black hair also changed colors, as it is common practice for characters with black hair in the original manga to receive dark blue hair in the anime adaptation to avoid palette problems with the character's head outline and confusion with the backgrounds. In the Saint Seiya movies, Ikki always appears helping Andromeda Shun and using the same methods to defeat his opponents. In the Heaven Chapter: Overture movie, however, Ikki is unable to defeat the Angel of Artemis until he fights alongside his younger brother and the two combine techniques to kill him. Later, he is seen with Shun going towards the place where Seiya is fighting Apollo. Reception In the section Right Turn Only! from Anime News Network, writer Liann Cooper noted that the fight between Ikki and Shun was a plot twist \\"skirmish\\". Mania Beyond Entertainment's Mark Thomas found Ikki to be one of the most interesting characters from the series, having liked his early role as an antagonist and his subsequent appearances as a partner for the Bronze Saints. His powers were also praised by Thomas, who noted he was \\"far too good for the Bronze Cloth\\", but was saddened with how he disappeared during his fight against Virgo Shaka. The character has also appeared in the Gin Tama interrupting most plot twists from horror stories causing protagonist Gintoki Sakata to fear they might get sued. IGN stated that Ikki was different from Seiya as he only acts whenever his allies are in problem in contrast to being a conventional hero like them. According to a guidebook, Ikki is the first and only user of the Phoenix Cloth. IGN found that the reason for why Ikki became its owner is unknown but multiple fans have made hypothesis in regards to it. HobbyConsolas found that the Netflix series adapted well the duel between Ikki and Seiya.

Its source of freshwater has been increased from natural historical levels by urban runoff.Noted in National Estuary Program Coastal Condition Report. The Siesta Key Bridge, carrying Siesta Drive, crosses the bay at its southern end. The bay and its surrounding area appeared on the earliest maps of the area, being named Zarazote on one dating from the early 18th century. Hunting in the area had supported native populations for more than ten thousand years as Florida attracted some of the earliest human settlements in the hemisphere. Following the retreat of the glaciers, ocean levels rose creating the current coastline and the natural bounty of Sarasota Bay provided food for inhabitants for over five thousand years before Europeans began exploration of the area in 1513 and later, establishing settlements along its shores. Sarasota Bay, the largest and deepest coastal bay between Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, is one of twenty- eight estuaries in the country that have been named by the U.S. Congress as an estuary of national significance.

It was the first single from the band's thirteenth studio album A Momentary Lapse of Reason. It reached number 70 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 1 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart in September, 1987, remaining three consecutive weeks at the top position in the autumn of the same year. Meanwhile, the song failed to chart on the official U.K. top 40 singles charts. On the other hand, in Spain, the song peaked at number 1 on the Los 40 Principales chart. Background The song was primarily written by David Gilmour, who developed the music from a 1986 demo by Jon Carin. The notable rhythm pattern at the beginning of the song was already present in the demo, and Carin stated that it was influenced by Steve Jansen or Yukihiro Takahashi. The lyrics describe Gilmour's thoughts on flying, for which he has a passion (being a licensed pilot with multiple ratings), though it has also been interpreted as a metaphor for beginning something new, experiencing a radical change in life, or, more specifically, Gilmour's feelings about striking out as the new leader of Pink Floyd after the departure of Roger Waters. Gilmour confirmed the latter interpretation on the Pink Floyd 25th Anniversary Special in May 1992. Also an avid pilot, drummer Nick Mason's voice can be heard at around the middle of the song. \\"Learning to Fly\\" was included on Pink Floyd's greatest hits collection Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. The track was regularly performed live on the band's two post-Roger Waters tours, with touring guitarist Tim Renwick playing the song's guitar solos (although David Gilmour played the solos on the studio version of the track). A live version is included on Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse. At the end of the final solo in both versions, a guitar lick from the second verse of \\"Young Lust\\" (\\"Oooh, baby set me free\\") is played. Music video The music video was directed by Storm Thorgerson, a longtime collaborator of Pink Floyd who had designed many of their album covers, and filmed on West Wind Ridge, a mountain in Kananaskis Country near Canmore, located some 50 to 75 km west of the city of Calgary, Alberta during rehearsals for the band's A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. The video combined performances of the band with a Native American, played by Canadian actor Lawrence Bayne, working in a field who then runs and jumps off a cliff to turn into a red-tailed hawk. The footage of the stage show shows the band performing \\"Learning to Fly\\" but features the more colourful light-show used for live performances of \\"One of These Days\\". The red/orange airplane is a Beech Model 17 Staggerwing. The original video also depicts a factory worker who turns into an aeroplane pilot as well as a child who breaks free from his mother and dives off a cliff into a deep river, swimming away. The video went to #9 on MTV's Video Countdown in November 1987 and was the #60 video of MTV's Top 100 Videos of 1987.

History of the Cause of Canonization According to the Vatican, here is the chronology of the process of canonization: =From death to beatification= *1975 - 1980: After Escriva's death on June 26, 1975, the Postulation for the Cause of his beatification and canonization started receiving thousands of reports of favors granted through his intercession; the postulation also received testimonies about his holy life. These came from people all over the world. *1980: Solicitation of the opening of the Cause of beatification and canonization of Msgr. Escriva from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on the 5th anniversary of his death. *1981: Granting of nihil obstat by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Promulgation by Cardinal Vicar of the Decree opening the Cause. On March 14, Creation by the Archbishop of Madrid of a tribunal, which, along with the tribunal constituted by the Vicariate of Rome, would receive the testimonies of those witnesses who either lived in Spain or preferred to give their testimony in Spanish. On May 12, Opening of the Roman process on the life and virtues of the Servant of God. On May 18, Opening of the process in Madrid under Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon. *1982: Creation of another tribunal to document a miracle attributed to the intercession of the Servant of God. This presided over by Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon. The miracle had occurred in 1976 with the sudden cure of a Carmelite nun suffering from terminal cancer. On April 3, this tribunal was concluded and a certified copy of the proceedings was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. *1984: Conclusion of the Madrid process on the life and virtues of the Servant of God under Cardinal Angel Suqu√≠a, the new Archbishop of Madrid. A complete, certified copy of the proceedings was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. On November 20, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints during its Ordinary Congress declared that the process on the miracle was valid. *1986: Conclusion of The Roman process on the life and virtues of the Servant of God under Cardinal Vicar of Rome. :Beginning of Preparation of the Positio, a compilation of documents to be examined by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The Positio would include the testimonies from both processes (in Rome and Madrid), a critical study on the life and heroic virtues of the Servant of God, testimonies obtained in both tribunals in Rome and Madrid together with abundant documentary appendices. It would be submitted and examined by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. From the material collected in the Roman and Madrid tribunals, under the direction of Father Ambrogio Eszer, O.P., Relator for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. *1987: Declaration of the validity of the Roman and Madrid processes on the heroic virtues of the Servant of God and their conformity with all legal prescriptions by The Congregation for the Causes of Saints *1988: In June, Submission of the Positio on the life and virtues of the Servant of God to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints for its definitive study. The document contained more than 6,000 pages in 4 volumes. *1989: On September, Affirmative Verdict on the Position by the Meeting of Theologian Consultants *1990: On March 20, Affirmative Verdict by the Ordinary Congregation of Cardinals and Bishops. On April 9, the Pope ordered the publication of the Decree on the heroic virtues of the Servant of God. After the promulgation of this Decree, the Postulation could present to the Congregation the Positio of the Madrid process on the proposed miraculous cure. On June 30, the Medical Consultants of the Congregation, in their technical report, concluded that the cure could not be explained by natural causes. On July 14, after examining the case, the Meeting of Theologian Consultants affirmed the miraculous character of the cure and attributed its cause directly to the intercession of the Servant of God. *1991: On June 18, Affirmative Verdict on the proposed miracle by the Ordinary Congregation of Cardinals and Bishops. On July 6, the Pope promulgated the Decree, which declared the miraculous nature of the cure. Having fulfilled all the legal requirements established for the causes of saints, the Pope decided to proceed to the beatification. *1992: Beatification of Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer in Rome on May 17. =From beatification to canonization= *1993: News about the miraculous cure of Dr. Manuel Nevado Rey. With the help of Dr. Nevado, the Postulation documented and carried out an exhaustive study on the disease he had suffered. Once the extraordinary character of the cure was clear, on December 30, the Postulation submitted the documentation and petitioned the Bishop of Badajoz (a diocese in Southern Spain) to open a process on the miracle. *1994: The diocesan investigation was carried out by the Episcopal Curia of Badajoz from May 12 - July 4. This was followed by a formal study carried out by the Congregation for Causes of the Saints after the diocesan proceedings were sent to Rome. *1996: On April 26, Declaration of full compliance by the Congregation that the process of the miracle had fully complied with the prevailing legal norms and praxis (Decree of Validity). *1997: On July 10, Unanimous affirmation by the Medical Consultants of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints of Dr. Nevado's cure of a cancerous state of chronic radiodermatitis in its third and irreversible stage to be very quick, complete, lasting and scientifically unexplainable. *1998: On January 9, Unanimous affirmation by the Theologian Consultants of the Congregation of the preternatural character of the cure and attributed the disappearance of the disease to the invocation of Blessed Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer. *2001: On September 21, Unanimous confirmation of the miracle by the Ordinary Congregation of Cardinal and Bishop members of the Congregation.Vatican: The Miracle Approved for the Canonization, September 21, 2001 The decree on the miracle was read before the Pope on December 20.Jos√© Cardinal Saraiva Martins: DECREE SUPER MIRO (on the miracle) of Blessed Josemar√≠a Escriv√° de Balaguer, Rome, December 20, 2001 *2002: On February 26, the Pope presided over the Ordinary Public Consistory of Cardinals, which gave its approval for the canonization of several Beati. Among them was Blessed Josemaria Escriva, whose canonization date was announced for October 6, 2002. Canonization Day Escriv√° was canonized by Pope John Paul II on 6 October 2002 in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican. During the canonization, there were 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around the world, general superiors of many orders and religious congregations, and representatives of various Catholic groups. One-third of the world's bishops (an unprecedented number) petitioned for the canonization of Escriv√°. (Messori 1997) During the days of the canonization event, Church officials commented on the universal reach and validity of the message of the founder, echoing John Paul II's decree Christifideles Omnes on Escriv√°'s virtues which said that \\"by inviting Christians to be united to God through their daily work, which is something men will have to do and find their dignity in as long as the world lasts, the timeliness of this message is destined to endure as an inexhaustible source of spiritual light, regardless of changing epochs and situations.\\" Criticism of the process of canonization Opus Dei's prelatic church, Our Lady of Peace, located in its central headquarters in Rome: Below the altar lie the mortal remains of St. Josemar√≠a. Opus Dei critics take issue with what they see as Escriv√°'s lightning canonization.ODAN's Opposition to the Canonization of Josemaria Escriv√° de Balaguer, September 11, 2002 They argue that the whole process was plagued by irregularities. Kenneth L. Woodward, the longtime religion editor and senior writer for the American newsmagazine Newsweek, says that the ‚ÄòDevil‚Äôs advocate‚Äô system was bypassed and witnesses hostile to Escriv√° were not called. According to him, it is not true that eleven critics of Escriv√°‚Äôs canonization were heard. He says there was only one. He says the \\"consultors\\" were mainly Italian and members of Opus Dei: this stopped Escriv√°‚Äôs many critical Spanish peers from upsetting the procedure, but it also broke the convention that \\"consultors\\" should be the fellow countrymen of the proposed saint. He also states that Opus Dei argued that Escriv√° was too \\"international\\" to need this.A coming-out Party in Rome , Kenneth L. Woodward. (1992, May 18) Newsweek. Serious charges were brought that Opus Dei prevented critics of Escriv√° from testifying at church tribunals called to investigate his life. Several former members were refused a hearing. Among them: Maria del Carmen Tapia, Father Vladimir Feltzman and John Roche. The positio claims, for instance, that Escriv√° lost his temper only once, yet many former members who knew him will insist he was routinely abusive of anyone suspected of being an enemy of Opus Dei. Former numerary Maria del Carmen Tapia relates this in her book Beyond the Threshold: A Life in Opus Dei.Maria del Carmen Tapia: Beyond the Threshold: A Life in Opus Dei Opus Dei officials have claimed that Escriv√°'s cause had been unanimously approved. However, Newsweek stated that two of the judges, Luigi De Magistris, deputy head of the Vatican's Apostolic Penitentiary, and Justo Fern√°ndez Alonso, rector of the Spanish National Church in Rome, did not approve the cause. In fact, one of the dissenters wrote that beatifying Escriv√° could cause the church \\"grave public scandal.\\"Woodward, Kenneth L., \\"A Questionable Saint,\\" Newsweek, Jan. 13, 1992 The journal Il Regno, published in Bologna by the congregation of the Priests of the Sacred Heart (the Dehonians), reproduced, in May 1992, the confidential vote of one of the judges in Escriv√°'s cause of beatification, in which the judge asks that the process be suspended and raises questions about the undue haste of the proceedings, the near absence of testimony from critics in the documentation gathered by the postulators, the failure of the documentation to properly address issues about Escriv√°'s relations with Francoist Spain and with other Catholic organizations, and suggestions from the official testimonies themselves that Escriv√° lacked proper spiritual humility.. The text of the vote for suspension is available here. This document does not identify the judge by name, but he indicates that he met Escriv√° only once, briefly, in 1966, while serving as a notary for the Holy Office, which implies that the judge in question was De Magistris. In his vote (which its own contents date to August 1989), De Magistris also argues that the testimony from the main witness, Msgr. √Ålvaro del Portillo, who was Escriv√°'s confessor for 31 years, should have been excluded from the proceedings. John Allen Jr. comments that, according to some observers, De Magistris suffered as a result of his opposition to Escriv√°'s beatification. De Magistris became head of the Apostolic Penitentiary in 2001, an important position in the Vatican bureaucracy which normally is followed by elevation to the cardinalate, but he retired less than two years later and was made a cardinal only in 2015 by Pope Francis. According to Kenneth Woodward, author of \\"Making Saints: How the Catholic Church Determines Who Becomes a Saint, Who Doesn't, and Why,\\" Opus Dei members put hundreds of bishops under financial pressure in order to have them send positive reports about Escriv√° to the Vatican. Especially in the Third World, bishops were allegedly told that financial contributions from Opus Dei might be in jeopardy if they did not answer the request for positive testimony. According to Woodward, 40% of the testimony came from just two men, (Alvaro) Portillo (deceased Opus Dei prelate and Escriv√°'s successor) and his assistant Father Javier Echevarria, (current Opus Dei prelate). On the other hand, supporters refer to Fr. Rafael Perez, an Augustinian, \\"one of the best experts\\" on canonization and who was the judge of Escriv√°'s Madrid Tribunal. He says that the process was fast because first, Escriv√°'s figure is \\"of the universal importance;\\" second, the Postulators \\"knew what they were doing;\\" third, in 1983 the procedures were simplified in order to present \\"models who lived in a world like ours.\\" Fr. Flavio Capucci, the Postulator, also reported that the 6000 postulatory letters to the Vatican showed \\"earnestness.\\" His team submitted 16 volumes on Escriv√°'s life including the published criticisms against him. The Tribunals listened to 92 witnesses, most of whom were non- members, much above the minimum. Among them were 11 ex-members. Of the 92, 66 were Spaniards who went to the Madrid court. Each one was asked 252 questions on Escriv√°'s life, 10 of which were based on the criticisms. Together with the investigative material, the 980 court sessions make this \\"the longest process to date.\\" Perez also noted that the Tribunal's work is very rigorous and it \\"listens only to people who are credible\\" and not to those who \\"just want to cause harm.\\" He also said that \\"money can never make a saint,\\" but \\"genuine interest.\\" Opus Dei supporters say that the other accusations including a slur against the bishops of the Catholic Church are baseless allegations which anyone can think up. Supporters also say that the attacks against the founder's beatification in 1992 have turned into acceptance and support by the time of the canonization in 2002. (Documentation Service Vol V, 3, March 1992) Escriv√°'s canonization was one of the first to be processed after the 1983 Code of Canon Law streamlined the procedures for canonization, and so it moved more quickly than was typical before. Even under the old procedures, the canonization of St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux took twenty-seven years, roughly the same as Escriv√°‚Äôs, while Mother Teresa, under the new procedures, was canonized nineteen years after her death. According to John Allen, Jr., Mother Teresa's process was quick not \\"simply because her postulator did a good job. It was clear that John Paul II wanted it to happen. Similarly with Escriva, the pope's long track record of support and devotion...left no doubt where he wanted the process to end. That, in fact, is probably the single most telling argument against the hypothesis that Opus Dei 'bought' or 'manipulated' the beatification and canonization. There was no reason why they had to.\\" \\"The most defensible conclusion,\\" says Allen, \\"seems to be that Opus Dei may have played hard and fast, but they played by the rules.\\" (Opus Dei, p. 265) Escriv√°'s books, including Furrow, The Way, Christ is Passing By, and The Forge, continue to be read widely both by members of Opus Dei and by other Catholics attracted to his spirituality, which emphasizes the laity's calling to daily sanctification (a message also to be found in the documents of Vatican II). Pope John Paul II made the following observation in his homily at the beatification of Escriv√°: :\\"With supernatural intuition, Blessed Josemar√≠a untiringly preached the universal call to holiness and apostolate. Christ calls everyone to become holy in the realities of everyday life. Hence work too is a means of personal holiness and apostolate, when it is done in union with Jesus Christ.\\" References * Allen, John, Jr. (2005).

It stretches from the European Square (northeast) through the Maidan and to Bessarabska Square (southwest) where the Besarabsky Market is located. Along the street are the offices of the Kyiv City Council which contains both the city's council and the state administration, the Main Post Office, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy, the State Committee of Television and Radio Broadcasting, the Central Department Store (TsUM), the Ukrainian House, and others. The entire street was completely destroyed during World War II by the retreating Red Army troops and rebuilt in the neo-classical style of post-war Stalinist architecture. Among prominent buildings that did not survive were the Kiev City Duma, the Kyiv Stock Exchange, Hotel Natsional, and the Ginzburg House. The street has been significantly renovated during the modern period of Ukraine's independence. Today, the street is still significant to administrative and business city organizations, as well as a popular tourist attraction. As of 2010, Khreshchatyk is included in the Top 20 of most expensive shopping streets in Europe. History The name of Khreshchatyk is believed to be derived from the Slavic word krest or khrest (cross). It lies in a valley that is crossed by several ravines. When looked at from above, the valley resembles a cross. A small river, the Khreshchatyk River, a tributary of Kyiv's Lybid River, ran along much of the valley, and still runs underground along much of the street. =Russian Empire= For a long time, Khreshchatyk remained an undeveloped ravine between several neighborhoods of Kyiv: Podil ‚Äì the commercial neighbourhood, the Upper City ‚Äì the administrative neighbourhood, and Pechersk neighbourhood built around the Pechersk Lavra (\\"Monastery of the Caves\\"). The development of the area only started in the 19th century. The ravine was filled and accelerating construction quickly followed. By the middle 19th century, Khreshchatyk was developed as Kyiv's main thoroughfare in the climate of rapid growth of the city during the Industrial Revolution in Imperial Russia. The street soon became the center of Kyiv's commercial life, as the city itself developed into the main commercial center in the Empire's south-west. In 1892, the first electric tram line in the Russian Empire ran in Kyiv and by 1894, the line was extended to Khreshchatyk. The street was served by the tram for about 40 years. =Revolution= During the period of chaos after the Russian Revolution of 1917, many buildings on Khreshchatyk were heavily damaged as the city changed hands many times between Ukrainian, German, Polish, and Bolshevik forces. On 9 May 1920, the Polish army under General Rydz-Smigly celebrated their capture of Kyiv by a ceremonial parade on Khreshchatyk. They were driven out by the Bolshevik counter-offensive within weeks. =Interbellum= City Duma building was heavily damaged during the World War II bombings of Kyiv. Between the wars, Khreshchatyk underwent major development and reconstruction. Between 1923 and 1937, the street was named after V.V. Vorovsky, an early Bolshevik diplomat assassinated in Switzerland. In the mid-1930s, the tram lines were deconstructed, and the trams replaced by trolleybuses. =World War II= During World War II, almost every building on the street was mined with explosives by the retreating Red Army troops. In September 1941, after German troops occupied the city, explosions were set off by radio-controlled fuses from over 400 kilometres away. The demolition of over three hundred buildings on Khreshchatyk became the first operation in history where the long-distance radio-controlled explosions were used for military purposes. Much of the surviving historic center of Kyiv was demolished. This unprecedented method of warfare caused panic and brought heavy casualties among both the occupiers and city's remaining civilian population. Under German occupation, the street was renamed Eichhornstrasse, after the German World War I Field Marshal Hermann von Eichhorn supreme commander of Army Group Kiev (Heeresgruppe Kiew) and simultaneously military governor of Ukraine during the previous German occupation, who had been assassinated in Kyiv in 1918.Mirror of the Century in Zerkalo Nedeli, 13‚Äì19 July 1996. =Soviet Ukraine= Khreshchatyk and its Stalinist architecture seen in the early 1980s. Following the war, Khreshchatyk was rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s. The street was widened to 75‚Äì100 meters and new buildings were erected in the Neoclassical Stalinist architectural style. Important buildings of the new ensemble include the City Council House (Kyivrada), the Central Post Office (Poshtamt) and Trade-Union House (Budynok Profspilok). It was used for demonstrations and parades in honor of 1 May (until 1969), Victory Day (9 May) and the October Revolution. The street was one of Kyiv's first landmarks that was serviced by the Kyiv Metro in 1960, (see Khreshchatyk (Kyiv Metro)) and was the system's first transfer station when the second line opened in 1976. On 1 May 1986, a few days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident, Soviet authorities held a traditional May Day parade on Khreshchatyk, to \\"calm people\\" and \\"prevent panic\\" caused by the disaster. Thousands of Kyivans, including many children, were exposed to dangerous doses of radiation. In the late 1980s, the porch of the Central Post Office building partially collapsed during heavy rain, killing a dozen people and injuring some. The porch was rebuilt in the following years according to its original design. On 24 July 1990, the first ceremonial raising of the Ukrainian national flag took place on Khreshchatyk, on the large flagstaff of the Kyiv City Council. Due to its central location, the street became the traditional place for political rallies. =Independent Ukraine= Imperial, Stalinist and modern buildings on the Khreshchatyk Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Ukraine becoming independent, the avenue gained a wider context as the central street of the country. During the late 1990s, a complex reconstruction took place, and most of the buildings were cosmetically cleaned up from elements, structurally upgraded and enhanced with colourful illumination. Modern electronic billboards and screens were also installed. In 2000‚Äì01, Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti, became the centre of the mass protest campaign known as Ukraine without Kuchma. Allegedly to keep the protesters out, the city Mayor (Oleksandr Omelchenko at that time) ordered a major reconstruction of the street, which led to significant rebuilding of Maidan Nezalezhnosti, and construction of two large underground shopping malls. In the winter of 2004, Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti became the centre of the main public protests of the Orange Revolution. The protesters' main tent encampment was situated in the street, and many Khreshchatyk buildings served as makeshift feeding and warming sites for the protesters, including the City Council House. In its peak, over a million people from all around Ukraine attended the rally.

The supporting cast features Jackie Cooper, Fay Wray, and Pert Kelton. Plot In the Gay Nineties, on New York's Bowery, saloon owner Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery), finds that his rival, Steve Brodie (George Raft), has thrown a muskmelon at his window. The happy-go-lucky Brodie explains that he threw the melon on a dare. As Connors threatens to fight him, the two learn of a fire in neighboring Chinatown. Both men call upon their volunteer fire brigades, and wager $100 on which will be the first to throw water on the fire. Although Brodie is first to arrive, he finds Connor's young pal, Swipes McGurk (Jackie Cooper), sitting on a barrel placed over the fire hydrant preventing Brodie from using it first. Connors arrives and the rival fire fighters brawl as the fire reduces the building to a smoldering ruin, presumably incinerating the crowd of Chinese trapped inside who had been screaming for help at the window. Brodie vows revenge on Connors, leading to a $500 bet that a boxer, whom Brodie calls \\"The Masked Marvel\\", can beat \\"Bloody Butch\\" a prizefighter that Conners manages. Conners accepts, and the \\"Marvel\\" knocks out Bloody Butch with one punch. After the fight, the \\"Marvel\\" is revealed to be John L. Sullivan (George Walsh). Connors meets a homeless girl named Lucy Calhoun (Fay Wray) and takes her to his apartment, where he lives with Swipes, and lets her spend the night. In the morning, he is pleasantly surprised (and Swipes annoyed), to find that Lucy has cleaned up the place and cooked breakfast. Swipes later locks Lucy in a closet and, when Connors finds her, spanks him. Humiliated, Swipes packs and leaves. That night, Brodie invites Swipes to move in with him, which he does. Finding out about Lucy, Brodie attempts to seduce her, thinking that she is Connors' mistress. She bites his hand, drawing blood, and after learning her identity, he apologizes and asks if he can call on her. They soon fall in love, and Brodie reveals his ambition to run a saloon bigger than Connors'. When two brewers offer to sponsor him if he can bring his name into prominence, Brodie decides to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge as a stunt. Connors bets his saloon against a free burial that Brodie won't survive. Scheming to avoid actually jumping, Brodie gets a life-sized dummy made up to look like him and arranges for Swipes to throw it off the bridge at the time of the jump. As a crowd of 100,000 gathers at the bridge, Swipes finds the dummy missing. Swipes observes, in dialogue that sounds eerily current to the modern ear, \\"They were hip to us so they copped it.\\" Despite Swipes's pleas, and left without any other option, Brodie vows to make the jump anyway, so that no one can say he didn't take a dare. Meanwhile, temperance activist Carrie Nation and her band of women arrive at Connors' saloon to tear it down with axes and hatchets. When he sees Brodie lifted in a parade after making the jump, however, Connors encourages the activists to destroy the saloon, which they do. Brodie re-opens the refurbished saloon, and when war is declared against Spain, Connors enlists in an effort to get away from the Bowery, where he is no longer a big shot. When he returns to his apartment to pack, he finds that Swipes has returned and reconciles with the boy. Professional rivals of Brodie's then find Connors and deceitfully tell him that Brodie did not actually jump from the bridge, showing him the dummy. Connors demands Brodie give his saloon back. Brodie denies using the dummy, and the two have a long fight on a barge in the East River to settle their differences. After Connors returns victorious, he is arrested for assault and battery with intent to kill. Brodie, however, refuses to implicate him. As Brodie recovers, Connors visits his hospital only to begin another fight, but Swipes stops them and urges them to become friends. After they shake hands, Connors dares Brodie to join him in Cuba. At a parade for departing soldiers, Connors tells Lucy to kiss Brodie goodbye, and after she does, she also kisses Connors. The men lament not being able to say goodbye to Swipes, but they soon see, to their delight, that he is hiding in an artillery box on the supply wagon just ahead of them.

The movie features Wallace Beery as saloon owner Chuck Connors, George Raft as Steve Brodie, the first man to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and live, Jackie Cooper as a pugnacious child, Fay Wray as the leading lady, and Pert Kelton as a bawdy dance hall singer. (There had been some talk that Clark Gable would play the Raft role.) Walsh later wrote that directing Beery and Raft \\"was like trying to keep the peace between a lion and a tiger\\" although he said \\"both men were big hearted, generous to a fault. Professional jealousy waned after each had registered his beef. Later, the became good friends.\\" The film is an absorbing presentation of the views and behaviors common at the time. The movie opens with a close-up of a saloon window featuring a sign saying \\"Nigger Joe's\\" in large letters (the name of an actual Bowery bar from the period). Cooper's character has a habit of throwing rocks at people's windows in Chinatown. When Beery's character berates him for doing so, Cooper's character responds, \\"They was just Chinks\\", whereupon Beery immediately softens, saying \\"Awww...\\" while affectionately mussing the boy's hair. At one point, Cooper's character breaks a window, knocking over a kerosene lamp and causing a lethal fire that spreads through the block. Frantic Chinese people trapped in the fire are shown desperately trying to escape, followed by a depiction of the ashes of their building in which they presumably died. The Bowery bears some resemblances to a concurrent movie She Done Him Wrong, a film starring Mae West and Cary Grant released earlier the same year by a different studio (Paramount Pictures) featuring Wallace Beery's older brother Noah Beery, Sr. in a similar role as a Bowery saloon owner sleeping with Mae West's character. Raoul Walsh had directed a groundbreaking film about the Bowery as far back as 1915. Regeneration (1915), shot on location in the Bowery, was the first full-length gangster movie, featuring tattered clothing on cast members far more ragged than anything seen in a more recent film and actual 1915 Bowery locations. The Bowery was produced by Twentieth Century Pictures. The Bowery was one of 11 films in which Wray portrayed the leading lady in 1933, including the original version of King Kong. Reception The film was Twentieth Century's second most popular movie of the year. The film was one of United Artists more popular films of the year. Raft would go on to make several more films for Daryl F Zanuck despite never being under long-term contract to him. Proposed Remake In 1943 it was announced 20th Century Fox would remake the film as a musical, Bowery After Midnight, with William Bendix in the Beery role. In 1946 the project was going to be called Brooklyn Bridge and star Victor Mature in the Raft part. In 1948 George Jessel was going to star. However, this project never got past the planning phase.

In 1578 king Stefan Batory created the Crown Tribunal in order to reduce the enormous pressure on the Royal (Sejm) Court. This placed much of the monarchs juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Tribunal (Trybuna≈Ç Litewski). Tribunal consisted of 27 secular deputies elected from nobility (szlachta) each year during the sessions of local parliaments (sejmiks) and 6 ecclesiastical deputies who were elected by their respective Chapters. The tribunal was headed by a Tribunal President (prezydent in Crown, prezes in Lithuanian Tribunal) and a Marshal (marsza≈Çek trybuna≈Çu). The Marshal was chosen from and by the judges themselves, while the President dealt with ecclesiastic matters (and was himself a high-ranking priest). Two main locations of the Crown Tribunal were the towns of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski (for lands of Greater Poland, held in autumn and winter) and Lublin (for lands of Lesser Poland, in spring and summer). Until 1590 some sessions were held in ≈Åuck, and since 1764 in Pozna≈Ñ. A session of the Tribunal would last six months. Decisions were supposed to be taken by consensus in the first or second voting, if there was no consensus, the third could was to be decided by a simple majority. The Tribunals had many problems since their creation, as the judges rarely had any formal training and were basically politicians elected each year. With the progressing degradation of Polish political system, in the early 18th century the Tribunals became as corrupted and dependent on the magnates as the Polish parliament, Sejm. Several minor reforms had little effect until finally, the Tribunals were subject to a major reform by the Great Sejm of 1788-1792. However those reforms, along with the Tribunals themselves, were soon annulled in the aftermath of the partitions of Poland. Crown Treasury courts were created in 1613 (Trybuna≈Ç Skarbowy Koronny, Trybuna≈Ç Skarbowy Litewski). Wages for all judges were decided at Sejm meetings.

Lake Apopka, as viewed from a commercial flight on January 21, 2012. Aerial of downtown Orlando, Florida. Lake Apopka is seen in the upper-right of the photo. Lake Apopka is the fourth largest lake in the U.S. state of Florida. It is located northwest of Orlando, mostly within the bounds of Orange County, although the western part is in Lake County. Fed by a natural spring, rainfall and stormwater runoff, water from Lake Apopka flows through the Apopka- Beauclair Canal and into Lakes Beauclair and Dora. From Lake Dora, water flows into Lake Eustis, then into Lake Griffin and then northward into the Ocklawaha River, which flows into the St. Johns River. History Through the 1940s, Lake Apopka was one of Central Florida's main attractions. Anglers traveled from throughout the United States to fish for trophy-sized bass in Lake Apopka, and 21 fish camps lined the lake's shoreline. Lake Apopka has a history of more than 100 years of human alteration, beginning with construction of the Apopka-Beauclair Canal in 1888. In 1941, a levee was built along the north shore to drain 20,000 acres (80 km¬≤) of shallow marsh for farming. The discharge of water, rich in nutrients from agricultural and other sources, produced conditions that created a chronic algal bloom and resulted in loss of the lake's recreational value and game fish populations. In July 1980, Tower Chemical Company (TCC), a local pesticide manufacturer, improperly disposed of significant amounts of DDE, a known endocrine disruptor, along with other toxic chemicals. As a result, these chemicals spilled into Lake Apopka, and the US Environmental Protection Agency was alerted. TCC shut down their operations in December 1980. In 1981, an EPA investigation began and the site was decommissioned and designated as a Superfund clean-up site. Despite their efforts, some of the chemicals seeped into the Florida aquifer and have proliferated into some of Central Florida's interconnected lakes and waterways. This chemical has caused health problems in much of the lake's wildlife population, and has caused infertility and other sexual disorders in several species, including alligators. In 1991, a coalition of real estate interests from the West Orange Community organized the Friends of Lake Apopka (FOLA) with the goal of reclaiming the lake from the agricultural interests who were discharging phosphorus laden water into the lake basin. Water from the lake was used to flood the farm fields during the hot summer months to restrict erosion and then discharged back to the lake before the growing season. A series of canals and high capacity pumps allowed the water to be introduced for irrigation and flooding or to discharge it when necessary. The phosphate laden water created a hypereutrophic condition resulting in algal blooms, robbing the lake water of oxygen and sunlight necessary to sustain plant life on the lake bottom. Over the decades, this condition caused the sandy bottom lake to be covered by a deep layer of muck. In 1996, Governor Lawton Chiles signed the Lake Apopka Restoration Act that provided funding to purchase the farmland responsible for the discharges. The shuttering of the farms allowed for the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) to begin plans to convert the fields back to the marsh area it had once been. A survey was taken of the site that identified the hot spots that contained chemical contamination, and cleanup was initiated. =North Shore Enhancement Area (NSEA)= Historically, more than 85 percent of the phosphorus going into Lake Apopka was from farms on the lake's north shore. To combat this problem, the District and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) purchased almost all of the farms for restoration between 1988 and 2001. This contributed to reducing discharges of excessive nutrients from farms to the lake. The 1996 Lake Apopka Improvement and Management Act authorized the District to set a phosphorus concentration target. Subsequently, the District established a restoration phosphorus-loading target for Lake Apopka of 15.9 metric tons of phosphorus per year. This represents a 75 percent reduction from 1989‚Äì1994 farming discharges. The target was later adopted as a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the lake, which has a goal of attaining an in-lake total phosphorus concentration of 55 parts per billion (ppb). Restoration of wetlands on the NSEA can reduce storm water discharges to Lake Apopka and related nutrient loading, accelerating the enhancement of the lake. The innovative restoration and remediation plan for the NSEA focuses on infrastructure requirements, soil inversion and soil amendment work needed to prepare the system for wetland restoration. The soil inversion process was developed as a remediation method to address the high levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) found in organic surface soils (the top 30 centimeters (cm) of soil). The pesticides remain in the organic soils from years of farm pesticide applications. The inversion process used modified farm equipment to plow up to one meter deep and essentially flip the soil, bringing up uncontaminated soil to the surface and covering the contaminated surface layer of soil. The work was completed in May 2009 and it helped ensure that OCPs were unable to enter the food chain. The inversion process reduced contaminants in the biologically active soil layer to safe levels on about 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) in the NSEA. Soils in the NSEA also contained excess nutrients such as phosphorus due to many years of agricultural production. Applying a ‚Äúsoil amendment,‚Äù which is a drinking water treatment residual, helps to trap excess phosphorus in soils. This helps mitigate the release of phosphorus from the soil to overlying water when the area is reflooded. The soil amendment was applied to about 2,800 hectares (7,000 acres) in the NSRA and was mostly complete in 2009. As infrastructure construction is completed for each phase, a biological assessment is prepared for review and submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). With USFWS concurrence, saturation and restoration flooding begins. The infrastructure is designed to help establish full wetland habitat with a wide range of water levels. The infrastructure also allows water transfer among different areas within the NSEA to minimize the need to discharge waters to the lake. As each new phase is flooded and naturally populated with wildlife, fish samples are routinely collected and analyzed to ensure that pesticide levels in their tissues are below established safe levels for fish-eating birds. Newly flooded phases are carefully monitored for at least one year to ensure that any accumulation of pesticides through the aquatic food web do not present a risk to water birds. In addition, weekly bird surveys are conducted to monitor usage and to ensure that problems are detected quickly. As of January 2011 nearly 4,000 hectares (9,870 acres) are in various stages of reflooding. On February 20, 2014, the Lake Apopka Loop Trail, which goes through the NSEA, was opened to the public. =The Marsh Flow-Way= The Marsh Flow-Way, which is a constructed wetland, is located along the northwest shore of Lake Apopka and west of the Apopka-Beauclair Canal. It began operation in November 2003 and the goal of the project is to remove phosphorus and suspended material already in Lake Apopka water. The system covers approximately and contains four individual wetland cells, in addition to levees, canals and ditches. The Marsh Flow-Way treats water pumped into it from Lake Apopka. The lake's water has excessive amounts of phosphorus, algae and suspended matter. Water flows west to east and is controlled by screw gates and riser boards in the individual cells. Treated water from all cells collects in a pump basin, where water is pumped into the Apopka Beauclair Canal. Most of the cleaner, treated water returns to Lake Apopka, while the remainder flows downstream toward Lake County Water Authority's nutrient removal facility (NuRF). Dominant vegetation communities growing in flow-way cells are shallow marsh and shrub swamp species. Shallow marsh includes species such as pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), arrowhead (Sagittaria lancifolia), cattail (Typha sp.), while shrub swamp includes primrose willow (Ludwigia peruviana), and some Salix spp. Open water areas are common in wetland cells. As incoming lake water passes through the Marsh Flow- Way's emergent vegetation, the water's flow rate slows and suspended particles, which contain phosphorus and other nutrients, settle out of the water column. The accumulating settled organic particles, along with settled decayed wetland vegetation, form new organic material layers, which overlay native soils. Retention time of lake water within the flow-way system typically ranges between two and seven days in the individual wetland cells. Water depths in the system can vary between . Like all ecologically engineered systems, the performance of the flow-way is seasonally variable. Typically, best performance is in cooler months (October through May), while poorer performance is in warm months (June through September). During the long-term (seven years of operation), performance is similar to initial predictions. On the long-term (through 2010), the system removes about 28 percent (2.7 metric tons per year) of the incoming total phosphorus load, and about 90 percent (4,500 metric tons per year) of the incoming total suspended solid load. =Harvesting gizzard shad= Removing gizzard shad from the lake removes the phosphorus contained in the shad's bodies as well as reduces the internal recycling of phosphorus within the lake. This improves water clarity by reducing the number of algae, which depend upon phosphorus for growth. Harvesting shad from other lakes has resulted in an improved food web, reduced algae, improved water clarity and improved conditions for game fish populations. This procedure may produce the same results in Lake Apopka. Through the fall of 2011, gizzard shad harvesting has removed about 8,400 metric tons (18.5 million pounds) of fish from the lake. This equates to removing about 58 metric tons (129,000 pounds) of phosphorus and 175 metric tons (387,000 pounds) of nitrogen via fish tissue, directly from the lake. In addition, the projected nutrient recycling reduction to the lake from gizzard shad feeding impacts is about 146 metric tons (322,000 pounds) of phosphorus and about 862 metric tons (1.9 million pounds) of nitrogen. =Restoring aquatic habitat= The District has planted wetland plant species behind protective barriers in Lake Apopka to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. These planting efforts are becoming less necessary as the lake's water quality and clarity improve and native aquatic plants re-establish themselves. An ongoing effort is under way to map the locations and extent of more than 350 native submersed plant beds. This total number varies from year to year. Improved water clarity has also made it possible for the nonnative invasive plant hydrilla to grow in the lake. Hydrilla can quickly outcompete native plants, so staff efforts are also focused on locating and treating these undesirable plants with herbicides. =Challenges= Restoring Florida's most polluted large lake has come with unforeseen problems. An estimated 676 birds died on former farms at Lake Apopka during late 1998 and early 1999. Most were American white pelicans, wood storks and great blue herons. Organochlorine pesticide (OCPs) residues remaining from agricultural practices were primary the cause of bird deaths. Birds accumulated OCPs by consuming contaminated fish. The District has conducted research to better understand the accumulation of OCPs through the food chain, from contaminated soil to fish, and from fish to fish-eating birds. The knowledge generated guides restoration of the former farmlands at Lake Apopka and is applicable to other projects designed to restore ecosystems impacted by agriculture. =Water quality improvements in Lake Apopka= Lake Apopka has responded to the reductions in external phosphorus loading from the watershed to the lake with improved lake water quality. Total phosphorus, chlorophyll and Secchi transparency showed improving trends between 1987 and 2010. However, during this 23-year period, three events contributed to a worsening of water quality within a given year. The first coincided with a storm in March 1993. However, the improving trend in water quality resumed the following year. The second occurred in 2001 and 2002 at the end of a severe drought. The lake lost nearly 80 percent of its volume and total phosphorus concentrations increased. However, the improving trend continued the following year. Total phosphorus concentrations between 2004 and 2006 were under 100 ppb and approached the TMDL target of 55 ppb. These long-term improvements persisted despite the hurricanes in 2004 and 2005. The most-recent event was a severe drought in 2007 and 2008, in which the lake lost up to 52 percent of its volume. Total phosphorus concentrations increased sharply at low lake stages, but total phosphorus concentrations declined again in 2009 and continued to decline and water quality continues to improve in 2010. The most recent data (September 2011) indicate that total phosphorus concentrations were 80 ppb (a decrease of 62 percent compared to the baseline period), chlorophyll a was 52 ppb (decrease of 36 percent), and water transparency (Secchi depth) was 37 cm, (increase of 53 percent). =Summary of accomplishments= The District's Governing Board approved a rule in 2002 limiting the amount of phosphorus that can be discharged into Lake Apopka or its tributaries as a result of new construction in the lake's watershed. The District has collaborated with local, state and federal agencies to: *Purchase more than 7,700 hectares (19,000 acres) of agricultural land along the lake's north shore, reducing the discharge of phosphorus from the farms and providing an opportunity to restore the former marshes to wetlands. About 4,000 hectares have been restored to wetlands *Operate the marsh flow-way. Through 2010, the marsh flow-way has removed about 19 metric tons of total phosphorus and about 32,000 metric tons of total suspended solids from Lake Apopka water *Harvest gizzard shad. From 1993 through December 2010, removed more than 58 metric tons of phosphorus and 175 metric tons of nitrogen in fish tissue from the lake *Replant six native wetland species of vegetation in the water along the lake's shoreline, which helps restore fish and wildlife habitat *Work with the Friends of Lake Apopka and the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council to develop a plan to ensure that future development does not negatively impact the lake References *The Road Atlas '06, Rand McNally, pg. 27 External links *\\"Growing Pains: Apopka farmworkers say pesticide exposure caused illnesses\\" - Orlando Weekly *Ocklawaha River Watershed and Lake Apopka Restoration - Florida DEP *Fishing Boats at A History of Central Florida Podcast *Lake Report from the Lake Apopka Farmworker Environmental Health Project *Report Summary from the EPA *http://www.epa.gov/Region4/waste/npl/nplfls/towercfl.htm *http://floridaswater.com/lakeapopka/ Category:Lakes of Lake County, Florida Category:Lakes of Orange County, Florida Category:Lakes of Florida ","title":"Lake Apopka"},{"id":"3643901","text":", simply known as Seiya, is a fictional character in the Saint Seiya manga series created by Masami Kurumada. He is the eponymous protagonist who makes his debut in the first chapter , published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on January 1, 1986. Like most of Kurumada's characters, Seiya's design was inspired in the main character of his previous hit manga Ring ni Kakero, Ryuji Takane. Seiya is one of the eighty-eight mythical warriors known as Saints who have served the Goddess Athena throughout the ages, protecting justice and peace on Earth. As a Saint, Seiya dons a powerful armor of divine origins known as a Cloth, the one which represents the constellation of Pegasus. Seiya also possesses superhuman strength and speed, two of the many extraordinary abilities the Saints draw from their guardian constellations and an inner essence called Cosmo. Critical reception to Seiya has been mixed. While many enjoy his character design and call of justice, many reviewers feels is overshadowed by other characters and the way he handles his fights. Creation and conception alt= While in the process of creating Saint Seiya, Masami Kurumada initially gave Seiya the name Rin, intending to title his manga . However, as he continued developing the story, he changed the name to Seiya, which he felt was more fitting. First he used the name with the Japanese characters that mean , to relate it to Seiya's condition as a Saint, but later decided to spell it as \\"star arrow\\", to emphasize the constellation and mythological motif. Finally, he changed the title of the manga to Saint Seiya, once the concept of the Saints was fully developed. Kurumada stated that one of the first ideas he had for Saint Seiya was the \\"Pegasus Meteor Fist\\". Since his manga was going to use the constellations as a very important and ever- present theme, he wanted his protagonist to have a special move that would be like a shower of meteors. Seiya's likeness was inspired by that of Takane Ry≈´ji, the main character of Kurumada's hit manga Ring ni Kakero created nine years before Saint Seiya and which he considers to be his favorite creation. Most protagonists in his works bear a resemblance to Ry≈´ji because Kurumada subscribes to Osamu Tezuka's Star System (maintaining a stable cast of characters who play a different or similar role in the author's various works, sometimes with the same personality, sometimes with a different one). The same process was used to create almost all the other characters in the series, as in all of Kurumada's works. The Sagittarius Gold Cloth was chosen as the most famous of the Gold Cloths because of its symbolism in relation to the main character. The Japanese meaning of Seiya's name, \\"star arrow\\", is also a metaphor for \\"meteor\\" and Sagittarius represents an archer, so Kurumada thought it would be a perfect match for Seiya, especially since he already had in mind that Seiya would eventually wear the Sagittarius Gold Cloth in certain parts. Hence, Seiya's zodiacal sign is Sagittarius. In the animated adaptations of the series, Seiya was voiced by several voice actors. T≈çru Furuya voiced him in the 1986 anime series, all five theatrical releases, the first series of original video animations (OVA) adapting the Hades arc of the original manga released in 2004 and the 2012 anime series Saint Seiya Omega. Hiroko Emori provided additional voice acting for scenes in which Seiya appears as a child. In the later Hades arc OVAs from 2005 to 2008, Seiya was voiced by Masakazu Morita. In the uncensored English dub by ADV, he was voiced by Illich Guardiola and Cameron Bautsch, and by Tim Hamaguchi in the censored dub by DiC Entertainment. He is voiced by Bryson Baugus in the CG Knights of the Zodiac and the Netflix dub. Furuya also said Seiya was his favorite character from all those he voiced and laughed when doing his iconic \\"Pegasus Meteor Fist\\". Morita has said that Seiya was one of his most favorite characters due to how \\"passionate\\" he is. Kaito Ishikawa mentions being happy with the work he was assigned to for Legend of Sanctuary. Character outline =Overview= Seiya is the eponymous main character of the Saint Seiya series. He is one of the eighty-eight Saints of Athena and serves loyally at her side. Seiya draws his superhuman powers from the Cosmos, the energy of the Big Bang that lingers inside each being and which connects a Saint to his constellation and Cloth. At the start of the series, Seiya is thirteen years old. His main objective is to find his older sister, Seika, who disappeared when he was sent to Greece to train to become a Saint under the supervision of the Silver Saint Eagle Marin. Due to her physical similarities to Seika, Seiya suspects that Marin may be his sister, but he later discovers he is wrong and finds his real sister. As Seiya starts fighting alongside the other Bronze Saints, albeit reluctantly at first, his motivations shift to the protection of Athena. Seiya is a person of burning passion and spirit, sometimes acting in brash and impulsive ways. Despite this, he is still a brave, kind-hearted and selfless young man; who is always willing to sacrifice himself for justice, his friends and Athena. His most notable characteristic is his absolute determination and refusal to ever give up, even when faced with impossible odds. He also has a habit of making jokes and can be unconcerned about the consequences of his actions. =Abilities= As a Saint, Seiya has been trained to learn how to use the power of the Cosmos within his own body and use it for super strength, speed, agility and reflexes. The Pegasus Cloth he wears represents the Pegasus constellation, which is associated with Pegasus, the divine winged horse from Greek mythology; which protects his body with durability. Seiya trained for six years and defeated ten other trainees to obtain the Pegasus Cloth and the status of Saint of Athena. The Pegasus Bronze Cloth is damaged various times throughout the series, with Aries Mu typically responsible for repairs. In the manga, the Cloth changes appearance each time it is fixed, while it remains the same in the anime adaptation until the series' second arc. After the Gold Saints use their blood to revive the Bronze Cloths at the end of the Sanctuary arc, the Pegasus Cloth takes on a golden hue whenever Seiya charges his Cosmo to the maximum. The version of the Cloth that Seiya uses in the Hades arc possesses wings that allow him to fly, both normally and through dimensions. During Seiya's fight against Thanatos, it reaches its God Cloth state, which was last seen in the ages of myth and further increases Seiya's Cosmo and vitality. In desperate situations, Seiya occasionally wears the Gold Cloth of Sagittarius, a Cloth whose true owner, Aiolos, died thirteen years before the events of the series. The Gold Cloth magnifies Seiya's Cosmo. Despite this, although Seiya uses the Sagittarius Gold Cloth many times throughout the series to save Athena, he is never officially granted ownership of the Cloth. Although Seiya begins his journey as a Bronze Saint, the lowest of the three ranks of Saints, his abilities gradually grow to rival those of the Gold Saints; the most powerful of Athena's soldiers. He achieves this by awakening his seventh sense, the essence and origin of the Cosmo. Before descending into the realm of Hades, he also awakens his eighth sense, known as Arayashiki, which allows him to enter the Underworld without being subject to Hades's rule. Appearances =Saint Seiya= Seiya is a young teenager who is trained by Marin in Greece to obtain the Pegasus Cloth and return to his home, Japan. There he discovers that his sister Seika has been missing ever since Seiya was forced to train in Greece, being separated from her, his childhood friend Miho, and all the other orphans. Saori Kido negotiates with him to fight other people who became Saints to attract the media's attention and have her group search for Seika. Seiya's constant fights are interrupted by his former companion Phoenix Ikki who wants revenge for the training he went through. Although Seiya defeats Ikki with his friends' help, the Saints are attacked by higher ranked Silver Saints sent by the Sanctuary's Pope. Learning that Saori is the reincarnation of Athena, the Saints go to the Sanctuary to face the tyrant Pope and have to run through all its Twelve Temples when Saori suffers a mortal wound. Master the Cosmos known as Seventh Sense, Seiya and his friends manage to defeat the strongest Gold Saints including the Pope, who is revealed as Gemini Saga, and save Saori. Following the battle against Saga, Seiya and his friends recover until Saori goes to confront Poseidon's reincarnation Julian Solo who wishes to flood the world and Saori tries to prevent it by giving her life in exchange. The Saints go to Poseidon's submarine temple where they fight Poseidon's Mariner Generals in order to free Saori. In the Hades arc, Seiya is sent out of the Sanctuary by an order from Athena meant to protect the Bronze Saints from the lord of the Underworld, Hades. However, after Saori's death, Seiya goes to the Underworld to deliver Athena's Cloth to her. Seiya eventually arrives in Elysion and, while fighting against the gods Hypnos and Thanatos he discovers his sister Seika is alive. After defeating Thanatos, Seiya encounters Hades. During the fight, Seiya is mortally wounded by the sword of Hades while protecting Athena and his Cosmo disappears shortly before the Saints achieve victory. =Saint Seiya: Next Dimension= Seiya's story continues in Kurumada's 2006 manga, Saint Seiya: Next Dimension (canonic sequel and prequel). Here, Seiya is shown sitting in a wheelchair. He has survived Hades's attack, but remains in an unresponsive state, suffering from Hades's curse. Seeking to save him from certain death, Athena Saori Kido, Shun Andromeda, Ikki Phoenix, Shiryu Dragon, Hyoga Cygnus travels to the past to find a way to remove Hades's sword before it can strike Seiya.Saint Seiya Next Dimension Vol. 1-10 Seiya is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of the Sagittarius successor to Sagittarius Aiolos.Saint Seiya Next Dimension vol. 11 cap.80 =As Pegasus Tenma= TenmaIn Next Dimension, Tenma is spelled in kanji as ; in The Lost Canvas, Tenma's name is only spelled in katakana, as a result of him being born and raised in Italy. is Seiya's incarnation in the 18th century. He appears in Masami Kurumada's Saint Seiya: Next Dimension and Shiori Teshirogi's Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas manga. Both have in common that Tenma is a childhood friend of Alone, Hades' chosen body in that time. Tenma has the same appearance as Seiya and uses the same techniques. =In other media= While Seiya often wears the Sagittarius Cloth in the manga and anime, he does not become its official wielder until Saint Seiya Omega In the last film takes place after the events of the Hades arc. Seiya is cursed by the sword of Hades instead of dying, while Athena and the other protagonist Bronze Saints are attacked by the gods of Olympus. In the end, Seiya manages to wound the god Apollo. The conclusion of the actual fight between the two is not depicted; instead, the climax of the movie cuts to a peaceful scene where Seiya apparently becomes reacquainted with Saori Kido. It was explained in the Japanese DVD audio commentary with director Shigeyasu Yamauchi that, since Seiya's and Saori's greatest strength was their love and trust for each other, Apollo erased their memories so that they would never again be able to find the will to rebel against the gods. Seiya also appears in a scene from Episode.G which reenacts Seiya's fight against Aiolia. In the sequel Episode.G Assassin an older Seiya appears in a parallel universe to protect Shiryu from an enemy named Sigurd. With Athena's help, Seiya reawakens his Pegasus God Cloth, giving him the power needed to defeat Sigurd. In Saint Seiya Omega however the story branches out the Hades Chapter in a different way. Seiya is shown in several flashbacks as having recovered, and still serving Athena, as Saori Kido, as the Sagittarius Gold Saint this time, revered as a legend and a source of inspiration to whom the newest Pegasus, K≈çga, looks at hoping to match his prowess and legendary deeds.Saint Seiya Omega news in Animenews Network Near the end of season-1, Seiya returns to help the Bronze Saints to stop the God of Darkness Abzu from manipulating Koga. He later lends Koga his Sagittarius Cloth to defeat the God. Following Abzu's defeat, Seiya is assigned by Athena the mission of killing the Goddess Pallas but fails due to his hesitation. Seiya later goes to defend the Academy Palestra and joins the Bronze and Steel Saints in their fights against Pallas' soldiers. When reaching Pallas' territory, he is in charge of bodyguarding Athena alongside the other Gold Saints until she confronts Pallas. Following Athena's victory, Seiya defeats Pallas' bodyguard Titan while he dons the evolved Sagittarius Cloth. He later fights the God of Time, Saturn, but is defeated and lends his Cosmos to Koga so that he will succeed in battle. Reception In Japan, Seiya is the least popular of the main characters in Saint Seiya, ranking fifth in the Bronze Saints character poll. However, in the technique poll, his Pegasus Meteor Fist ranked first. Merchandise based on Seiya has also been released, including plushes and action figures with different cloths. In a Saint Seiya Omega poll, Seiya was voted as the best character. Several anime and manga publications have provided both acclaim and criticism of Seiya's character. DVDVerdictReview.com describes Seiya as poorly developed, wholly characterised by his affiliations and connection to a constellation. DVDVisionJapan comments on Seiya's interesting character and praises voice actors T≈çru Furuya and Illich Guardiola for adding emotion and passion into his character. Anime News Network, on the other hand, comments that Seiya's voice actor for the English dub is unsuitable, that he enunciates strange words and does not sound at all heroic. They also criticized Seiya for being an \\"underdog\\" in most battles. Chris Beveridge from AnimeOnDVD found that Seiya was overshadowed by his comrades in the anime's tenth DVD but still found the other characters made the DVD appealing. In a review of the series, writer Jason Thompson notes one of Seiya's early fights against the Black Saints ends with one of the most painful scene as Seiya's blood is contaminated and later his friend Shiryu has to heal him by removing all of his blood. Additionally, Thompson noted that Seiya's speech in the series' last arc regarding how he blames gods for humanity's problems, to the point of being noted as \\"atheism or anti-theism\\" comparing him with the 2010 film Clash of the Titans. Mark Thomas of the Fandom Post criticized Seiya's overuse of his Meteor Fist as he tends to repeat in all of his fights even when his enemies manage to block it. In a review of Legend of Sanctuary, Screen praised Seiya's comical characterization as well as the performance of the Pegasus Meteor Fist technique. GamerFocus complimented the way Seiya and his friends were handled in Saint Seiya Omega as while the protagonist, Pegasus Koga, stars alongside a new group of Saints, Seiya's actions do not take the spotlight. In \\"Blood, Biceps, and Beautiful Eyes: Cultural Representations of Masculinity in Masami Kurumada's Saint Seiya\\", author Lorna Piatti-Farnell notes that the masculinity Seiya, Shun, Hyoga and Shiryu bow to involves accomplishments of their goals of justice might not come as a surprise as the magazine Shonen Jump often has manga that involves this predicaments. Michael Jackson regarded himself as a fan of Seiya's character. In regards to the Netflix series, HobbyConsolas warned long time fans not to expect the original violent battle between Shiryu and Seiya from the original series as a result of the demographic intended. The Daily Dot criticized the friendship Seiya develops with his friends as they form a bond despite knowing each other for only four episodes in the Netflix series.

Photo of William Blandowski Early life Blandowski was born in Gleiwitz, Upper Silesia, Kingdom of Prussia (now Gliwice, Poland) on 21 January 1822. The youngest of thirteen children his parents, Johan Felix von Blandowski and Leopoldine Gottliebe von Woyrsch were Protestants, and members of the minor Polish aristocracy, using the Wieniawa coat-of-arms. He was educated at the Gymnasium in Lauban but left without gaining his Abitur certificate. He went on to study at the Tarnowitz Mining School and the University of Berlin. Blandowski‚Äôs education was impacted by the death of his father, financial hardships, and controversies which resulted in quiet expulsions from various institutes. After completing his education, he was employed as an assistant manager at the Koenigsgrube coal mine at Koenigsh√ºtte. A tempestuous character, he became swept up in the revolutions of 1848, and wrote a letter to his employer about his revolutionary sentiments. Resigning before he was dismissed, he then joined the Schleswig-Holstein Army in March 1848 and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. After completing his army service he tried unsuccessfully to obtain another appointment in the Prussian Mining Service, but was turned down. These setbacks were one of the motivations for him to emigrate to Australia in 1849.  Exploration  Blandowski arrived in Adelaide on 14 September 1849. There are reports his passage was paid by a patron, Karl Bernhardt Maximilian Wiebel (Wibel) (1808 ‚Äì 1888) a founding member of the Zoological Museum in Hamburg. He began exploring the area around Adelaide, and his sketches from this period include geological scenes, fossils, animals, the Aborigines and their artefacts. Some are crudely executed on the spot, while others have been refined for further circulation. He sent back specimens and sketches to Hamburg. Blandowski was ambitious, and made unsuccessful applications to the government, and influential colonists, to fund his explorations and surveys. These entreaties were not successful, and he left South Australia for the goldfields of Victoria in 1851. He made a fortune on the goldfields, and he invented a double-action force pump to prevent mines being flooded. This success increased his profile and gained him the longed- for entr√©e into the upper echelons of society. He was the first scientist appointed by Governor La Trobe to the new Victorian Museum on 1 April 1854, and had responsibility for early purchases of objects, specimens and books for the museum. He later became a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria, a forerunner of the Royal Society of Victoria. He was also a founder of the Geological Society of Victoria in 1852. In 1856, the Philosophical Institute, with ‚Ç§2000 in government backing, initiated a scientific expedition (the Blandowski Expedition) to the Murray River, led by Blandowski, with Gerard Kreftt as second in command. The expedition travelled from Melbourne to Mildura Station between 6 December 1856 and 8 April 1857. A camp was located at Mondellimin (near modern Merbein) on the southern side of the Murray and, except for some side journeys made by Blandowski, the expedition stayed there for eight months. The Nyeri Nyeri people camped with the expedition and supplied most of the natural history specimens. Blandowski left the expedition early, returning to Melbourne via riverboat and steamer at the beginning of August. Krefft returned to Melbourne at the end of November 1857.  Controversy  Throughout his life his ego and lack of interpersonal skills resulted in great disappointments, and public scandals. Blandowski decided to name some fish species documented on this expedition after members of the Philosophical Institute's council. However, a controversy ensued when two prominent council members felt insulted by his descriptions of the fish named for them: > 'Sample N. Slimy, slippery fish. Lives in the mud. Is of a violent bluish > colour on the belly. The whole upper surface is of a dirty olivish-green > colour, with numerous irregular dark patches.' > 'Sample B. A fish easily recognized by its low forehead, big belly and sharp > spine.' It is not known if Blandowski's insult was intentional, but it certainly led to substantial acrimony in the council. Blandowski refused to withdraw the descriptions or the paper in which they appeared, and was quickly censured by the council. The insulted parties attempted to have him expelled from the Institute, but eventually withdrew themselves when they could not obtain the required two-thirds majority of votes.Science and the making of Victoria ‚Äì Philosophical Institute of Victoria, p. 21‚Äì22. Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre and The Royal Society of Victoria. Retrieved May 16, 2013. Blandowski remained active in the Philosophical Institute for the next three years, participating in the Exploration Committee that organised the Burke and Wills expedition. He felt strongly that Victorians should be actively involved in exploring Australia. Blandowski returned to Europe in 1859 and complained of his treatment in Australia.  Legacy  In his account of the expedition, Blandowski states that he brought back to Melbourne 28 boxes and parcels, of about 16,000 specimens, registered under 2000 different number and travelled about 1300 miles. During this expedition, Blandowski made efforts to document the everyday activities of Indigenous people, as well as dramatic conflicts and rituals, he also developed close relationships with Aborigines and was sympathetic to their situation. In the early 21st century revived interest in Blandowski‚Äôs explorations has generated discussion on the provenance of the sketches and illustrations attributed to him. His early sketches drawn while he was in South Australia, reveal he had little skill as an artist. During the Blandowski Expedition, Krefft was employed as an artist and made hundreds of drawings of the specimens gathered and the environment and people they encountered, these drawings are highly nuanced and capture in fine detail the images he is recording. [Corroboree on the Murray River] / by Gerard Krefft, 1858 When he was back in Melbourne, Blandowski employed James Redaway to create engavings of some of the drawings, and in Germany Gustav M√ºtzel also created illustrations and etchings. In 1862 he published Australian in Australien in 142 Photographischen Abbildungen, a pamphlet illustrated by Gustav Mutzel about his experiences in Australia, with different sections dealing with Indigenous culture, economy, activities, initiation ceremonies, combat, sickness and death. In this work Blandowski does not attribute the drawings to Krefft, and this has created some of the confusion about attribution of the works. What is known is that in many cases the final works were either taken from photographs, turned into etchings and then photographed again, or were originally sketches that became etchings. In all cases the works were enhanced using the artistic conventions of the time. He is commemorated in a genus of marine fish (Blandowskius), and of the Murray River perches (Blandowskiella).  Death  He was committed to a lunatic asylum in Bunzlau (now Boles≈Çawiec) in 1873, and died there in 1878.

Nomenclature The term electroextraction is used to describe multiple processes. In this article, electroextraction describes the extraction of charged particles through a liquid phase barrier. The term can be used to describe electrowinning, which is the extraction of metals from their compounds via electrochemical processes. Electroextraction also describes a process of permeating bioproducts from a cell membrane using an electric field.Electroextraction. http://www.electroextraction.org/ . Use in Chemical Engineering Johann Stichlmair developed electroextraction at the University of Essen in Germany in 1987 as an improvement on liquid-liquid extraction in an electric field. Electric fields are applied to enhance the demixing of a sample in a two-phase system. However, as current flows through the system, the resulting convective mixing disrupts separation. Electroextraction corrects for this. Two or three liquid phases that are electrically conductive and immiscible with one another are kept between electrodes, and upon addition of an electric field, charged particles travel from one phase to another separating anions and cations. A two-phase system brings anions into one phase and cations into the other. A three phase system extracts anions and cations into the two outer phases while leaving uncharged particles in the middle phase.Kuban; Slampova; Bocek. Electrophoresis 2010, 31, 768-785. Convective mixing is restricted to each phase and does not travel between phases. A diagram is given in figure 1. Organic phases that are used typically have small amounts of water added in order to be conductive. Other possible phases include mixtures of water and highly polymerized substances, or water with non-ionic surfactants. Electroextraction has also influenced the development of similar electrophoretic separation techniques involving a membrane between the two-phase systems. Figure 1. A diagram of the electroextraction process. Particles cross the phase barrier while any convective mixing is constrained to each phase =Applications= Electroextraction has been successfully employed in the separation of dyestuffs from wastewater. Electroextraction is better suited over other techniques for its ability to extract small amounts of dye from very dilute solutions. EE has also been effectively used in the separation of amino acids. This separation was done using an aqueous two-phase system of dextran- polyethylene glycol-water to stabilize the amino acids.Zhai, S.L.; Luo, G.S.; Liu, J.G. Chem. Eng. J. 2001, 83, 55-59. The velocity of a particle crossing the phase barrier is directly proportional to the strength of the applied electric field, so 100% separation is achieved with a strong enough field.Luo, G. S.; Yu, M. J.; Jiang, W. B.; Zhu, S. L.; Dai, Y. Y. Sep. Sci. Technol. 1999, 34, 781-791. Use in Analytical Chemistry A diagram of an electroextraction apparatus is shown in figure 2. The apparatus consists of a vial with a conical bottom, a grounded platinum electrode, a capillary to inject the aqueous solution, and an adjustable gold anode with a circular bottom that contacts the entire organic phase. Figure 2. A diagram of an electroextraction apparatus EE is also often performed in a capillary electrophoresis capillary. This is referred to as capillary electroextraction, or cEE. In this set up, shown in figure 3, a capillary containing aqueous phase is placed in a vial of organic phase and surrounded by a hallow cathode. The outlet of the capillary is then grounded.Lindenburg; Seitzinger; Tempels; Tjaden; van der Greef; Hankemeier. Electrophoresis 2010, 31, 3903-3912. Figure 3. A diagram of a capillary electroextraction apparatus When EE is coupled to isotachophoresis coupled to capillary electrophoresis, limits of detection decrease to the nanomolar range and isotachophoresis takes only a few minutes to complete. Similar limits of detections are obtained when EE is coupled to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Similar limits of detections are obtained when EE is coupled to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. =Applications= EE is ideal for pharmaceuticals with low concentrations of active ingredient, such as those containing proteins and peptides, because of its ability to lower limits of detection for liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis.Stroink; Paarlberg; Waterval; Bult; Underberg. Electrophoresis, 2001, 22, 2374. In addition, sample enrichment by EE helps overcome the low injection volumes and short optical path length of UV-Vis detectors that accompany CE. EE coupled to CE has been used to separate and analyze antisense oligonucleotides. Antisense oligonucleotides inhibit protein expression from their complementary base pair sequence and can treat certain diseases and genetic disorders.Palm; Marko-Varga. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2004, 35, 415. EE coupled to liquid chromatography also successfully detects low concentration metabolites in urine for the purpose of studying metabolic processes.Lindenburg; Tjaden; van der Greef; Hankemeier. Electrophoresis 2012, 33, 2987-2995. In addition, EE-ITP-CE has been used in the determination of the drugs clenbuterol, salbutamol, terbutaline, and fenoterol.Al-Majed; Analytical Profiles of Drug Substances and Excipients. 2001, 162, 429-441.

He played for the New York Mets and Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2006 through 2010. He previously served as assistant pitching coach and vice president of pitching development for the Boston Red Sox. Amateur career Bannister was born in Scottsdale, Arizona. He had a remarkable high school career at Chaparral High School, former home of Chicago White Sox star Paul Konerko, as he was named All-Region and All-City in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Chaparral was the runner-up to the state title in 1997 and 1998, but in Bannister's senior year, he helped take home the state championship by striking out seven of the nine batters he faced in the championship game. He began his college career as a walk-on at the University of Southern California. Entering as a second baseman, he became a full-time pitcher before the start of his freshman season. He posted an ERA of 4.35 in ten games out of the bullpen in his freshman year. Acting as the team closer during his 2001 sophomore campaign, he compiled a 2.80 ERA in thirty- five relief appearances. Bannister helped the Trojans to the College World Series in both 2000 and 2001 while pitching alongside former Major Leaguers Mark Prior and Anthony Reyes. After the 2001 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He redshirted in 2002, due to arthroscopic elbow surgery to remove impinged scar tissue in his elbow. He was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 2002, but did not sign. He returned to the Trojans in 2003 to play his junior year, which was also his first year as a starter. In eighteen games (fourteen starts), Bannister compiled a 6‚Äì5 record with an ERA of 4.53. Professional career Bannister was drafted by the Mets in the seventh round of the 2003 amateur draft and, after signing, was assigned to the Class-A Brooklyn Cyclones. There he put together a strong season, posting a 4‚Äì1 record with an ERA of 2.15 in twelve games (nine starts) and was named a New York‚ÄìPenn League Postseason All-Star. In 2004, Bannister was assigned to play for High-A St. Lucie in the Florida State League, where he put together a 5‚Äì7 record with a 4.24 ERA in twenty starts and was a Florida State League All-Star. His experimentation with throwing a two-seam fastball and circle changeup led to this decline in numbers, but prepared him for the competition at higher levels of professional baseball. Bannister was then promoted to AA Binghamton following the trade of Scott Kazmir to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, where he had a 3‚Äì3 record and an ERA of 4.08 in a mere eight starts. After the 2004 season, Bannister played for the Peoria Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League. He posted strong numbers, going 2‚Äì0 with a 3.77 ERA against the top prospects in the minor leagues. More importantly, he developed his cut fastball while in the AFL, which would develop into one of his strongest pitches. The next year, Bannister began the 2005 season in Double-A Binghamton, where he posted numbers that reflected the quality of his newly developed pitches: a 9‚Äì4 record with a 2.56 ERA in eighteen starts. This earned him an All-Star selection for the third consecutive season, and the honor of starting pitcher for the Double-A All-Star Game. This display caused Bannister to earn a promotion to AAA Norfolk, where he showed further promise against better competition. He finished his AAA campaign with a 4‚Äì1 record and an ERA of 3.18 in eight starts. =2006= New York Mets in 2006 At 25 years old, Bannister made his Major League debut against the Washington Nationals. His first major league win came in his second start, also against Washington, on April 11, 2006. A former second baseman, Bannister also excelled at the plate, acquiring four hits in his first ten at-bats, including three doubles. After making five starts, Bannister was put on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right hamstring which he injured while running the bases in the fifth inning of an April 26 game against San Francisco. Bannister was later moved to the 60-day DL. Bannister made 5 starts for the Mets and had a record of 2‚Äì0 with a 2.89 ERA. Bannister spent a month on a Minor League rehab assignment, pitching for the St. Lucie Mets and the Norfolk Tides. When Orlando Hern√°ndez was unable to pitch in late August, Bannister made a spot start against the Phillies, giving up 4 runs in 6 innings in a 4‚Äì3 loss. The game was Bannister's first major league defeat. Immediately after the game, Bannister was optioned to AAA Norfolk to allow √ìliver P√©rez to make a spot start the following day. Bannister returned to the Mets for the month of September and made two relief appearances. On September 6, 2006, the Brooklyn Cyclones honored Bannister with his own bobblehead and retired his number, 19. Bannister was the first pitcher from the Cyclones to make his Major League debut with the Mets. Because his hamstring injury reduced the number of innings pitched in 2006, Bannister joined the Tomateros de Culiac√°n in the Mexican Pacific League. He won in his debut, pitching five innings against the Algodoneros de Guasave. After completing the first half of the season with the Tomateros, Bannister returned home with a 3‚Äì2 record and a 3.68 ERA. On December 5, 2006, during the MLB Winter Meetings, Bannister was traded from the New York Mets to the Kansas City Royals for relief pitcher Ambiorix Burgos. =2007= In spring 2007, Bannister's high school jersey number, 15, was retired alongside former Chaparral High School players Darryl Deak, Brian Deak, coach Mark Miller, and former Chicago White Sox star Paul Konerko. On April 24, 2007, Bannister made his debut with the Royals against the Chicago White Sox. He gave up 4 runs, 3 of them earned runs, in 4 and 1/3 innings, and was not involved in the decision. In June 2007, Bannister was one of two major league pitchers to win 5 games, going 5‚Äì1 with a 2.75 ERA in six starts, including a streak of 18 innings without an earned run, and was named AL Rookie of the Month. He also received the same award in August after winning 4 games in the month. On August 16, 2007, Bannister threw his first career complete game, a four-hitter against the A's. He threw 111 pitches, 73 for strikes. Bannister finished 3rd in the 2007 American League Rookie of the Year voting, after finishing 12‚Äì9 with a 3.87 ERA. He received 1 first place vote, 8 second place votes, and 7 third place votes. Bannister was selected to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team. The selection was the result of the 49th annual Topps balloting of Major League managers. =2008= In 2008, he was named the Royals' number-2 starter behind Gil Meche. He led the majors in grand slams allowed, with four. He regressed from his 2007 form, and saw his ERA spike from 3.87 to 5.76. He finished with among the highest loss totals for starting pitchers that year, finishing 9‚Äì16. On 8/17/2008 against The Yankees, Bannister gave up 10 earned runs on 10 hits (3 homeruns) and 3 walks while pitching only one complete inning. In this year, his daughter Brynn was born on October 11. =2009= After a poor 2008, Bannister started the 2009 season with AAA Omaha before promptly being called up a week later to fill the number 5 spot in the rotation. After adding a new changeup to his repertoire, his ground ball rate increased and he had a 7‚Äì7 record and a 3.59 ERA into early August, ranking in the Top 10 in the American League in ERA and being the subject of numerous trade deadline rumors. Unfortunately, he suffered a season-ending right rotator cuff tear in a 117 pitch game August 3 against Tampa Bay. After attempting to pitch with the injury and losing five consecutive starts, he was placed on the disabled list for the rest of the season. He finished the year compiling a record of 7‚Äì12 with a 4.73 ERA. =2010= Bannister spent the winter rehabilitating his shoulder and returned to what would be his last MLB season. His ineffectiveness was obvious, and he struggled with giving up home runs and pitching deep into games. On June 23, 2010, Bannister and the Royals handed Washington Nationals phenom Stephen Strasburg his first career loss in a 1‚Äì0 victory in Washington. His season finished with a miserable loss at Cincinnati, a minor league rehab stint, and a loss to the Minnesota Twins. In 2010, he was chosen as \\"honorable mention\\" in a list of the smartest athletes in sports by Sporting News. =2011= In January 2011, Bannister signed a two-year contract to play for Japan's Yomiuri Giants. In March, Bannister retired following the earthquake and tsunami in Northern Japan, stating he had no further plans to play in either Japan or the United States. He currently runs a fund that supports non-profit organizations for families in crisis in the San Francisco Bay Area. Post-playing career During his pitching career, Bannister became known in baseball for his interest in scouting and player analysis and evaluation. He became interested in statistical analysis and Sabermetrics such as FIP and UZR as means of determining a player's true value. On January 13, 2015, Bannister joined the Boston Red Sox as a member of its professional scouting department. On September 9, 2015, he was promoted by Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski to a new position, director of pitching analysis and development. On July 6, 2016, Bannister was promoted to assistant pitching coach. On November 3, 2016, he was promoted to vice president of pitching development, in addition to his role as assistant pitching coach. After the 2019 season, he was taken off the coaching staff while remaining as vice president of pitching development, until leaving the Red Sox to take a front- office position with the San Francisco Giants in December 2019. Photography career Bannister is an avid photographer and photography supporter. He is the founder of a full-service photography studio complex and equipment rental house in Phoenix, Arizona. He graduated cum laude from the University of Southern California with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the School of Fine Arts. His work has been featured in The New York Times, New York Daily News, and American Photo. Personal Bannister is married and has one daughter, Brynn, who was born in the 2008 offseason. In 2011, his son Atley was born in December. He is a devout Christian and the oldest son of former Major League All-Star pitcher Floyd Bannister, who pitched from 1977 to 1992 with Houston, Seattle, Chicago (AL), Kansas City, California, and Texas. His uncle, Greg Cochran, also played in the Yankees' and Athletics' minor league systems. His brother Brett spent time as a pitcher in the Mariners' system, and his brother Cory pitched at Stanford. Brian and Brett are both members of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

It was founded in 1933 and named for John Marshall, the fourth chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. AJMLS is accredited by the American Bar Association. AJMLS offers five J.D. programs: full-time day, part-time day, part-time evening, accelerated/spring start,Atlanta‚Äôs John Marshall Law School Announces Spring Admission to Begin January 2014 http://www.johnmarshall.edu/atlantas-john-marshall-law-school- announces-spring-admission-begin-january-2014/ and a Criminal Justice Certificate Program (led by MacArthur Genius Fellow, Jonathan Rapping). The Certificate Program had previously been offered as the Criminal Justice Honors Program from 2011‚Äì2018. AJMLS students may apply to co-enroll in the Certificate Program after successful completion of their first year curriculum.  History  AJMLS was founded in 1933 in Atlanta. It did not receive American Bar Association (ABA) approval until 2005. In October 2017, the ABA concluded that the Law School is not in compliance with ABA Standards 301(a), 309(b), and 501(a)/501(b), and in December 2018, the ABA placed the school on probation for \\"substantial\\" and \\"persistent\\" non-compliance with those standards. At its November 2019 meeting, the Council removed the Law School from probation and Atlanta's John Marshall Law School remains an approved law school. On May 15, 2020, the ABA again found the Law School to be significantly out of compliance with Standard 316, relating to bar passage. In late 2011, AJMLS opened a branch campus in Savannah, Georgia, named Savannah Law School. In March 2018, the Law School announced its branch campus in Savannah was no longer accepting applications for 2018 and offered its current students options to continue their legal education in Savannah, initiate an intra-campus transfer to the main campus in Atlanta, or seek to transfer or visit at a different institution. A class action suit on behalf of Savannah Law School students claims that the Savannah school is being closed to benefit the parent school in Atlanta. In 2017, AJMLS received attention when an alleged student was said to be a white nationalist organizer who sent a lynching threat to a Black activist in Atlanta. On May 15, 2020, the council of the American Bar Association‚Äôs Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar met remotely and determined this school and nine others had significant noncompliance with Standard 316.

Plenty is located equidistant among Kindersley, Biggar, Kerrobert and Rosetown and approximately 150 kilometres southwest of the City of Saskatoon.  History  Plenty incorporated as a village on March 25, 1911. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) chose the name Plenty. As the railroad was being laid, the future town site and surrounding areas were the first fields on the line that had good crops, thus appearing to be \\"the Land of Plenty\\", and the town received its name from this inspiration. Approximately north of Plenty is the Moore's Ravine Municipal Heritage Site (Richard's Pasture) made up of approximately designated on which are located several Aboriginal heritage sites including two turtle effigies, the Plenty Medicine Wheel, and test pits where archaeological digs have revealed hundreds of scattered buffalo bones. This site is on private land. east of Plenty is Lake Opuntia. It is a stopping place for birds and wildlife and covers approximately 1395 hectares. In the 1950s, the area surrounding the lake was made a game preserve to regulate hunting. Opuntia Lake is strategically situated in the major goose fall staging area of Western Canada, is a very important staging area for waterfowl. Estimated maximum fall concentrations include 15,000 to 20,000 geese (Canada, White-fronted, Snow and Ross' geese), up to 30,000 ducks (mainly Mallard, Pintail, and assorted divers), 2,000 Sandhill Cranes and 500 Tundra Swans. The lake supports only a small number of breeding and moulting dabblers and divers. During the 1950s, a program of tree planting occurred at the lake along with the construction of baseball diamonds and a boat house. For several years the Plenty Sports Day was held at the lake. Several attempts were made to stock the lake with fish but the lakes salinity and fluctuating levels brought an end to this project and the use of the site for the sports day. In the mid 1970s, a dirt and stock car track was built near the gravel pits at the lake. Although the track was completed, races were never held.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Plenty recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census of Population, the Village of Plenty recorded a population of , a change from its 2006 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. Economy The economy of Plenty and area is primarily driven by agriculture with some oil and gas activity to the west and south of the town. Education Plenty is located within the Sun West School Division. North West Central School, a Kindergarten to grade 12 school, services the surrounding communities of Kelfield, Ruthilda, and Stranraer and provides high school services for the community of Dodsland.http://www.sunwestsd.ca/plenty/ North West Central School website Notable people Plenty is the home town of the late Brad McCrimmon (1959‚Äì2011), former captain of the NHL's Calgary Flames and winner of the Stanley Cup with the Flames in 1989. It is the birthplace of Brad's brother Kelly McCrimmon, former player, coach and General Manager of the Brandon Wheat Kings and General Manager of the Vegas Golden Knights. Plenty is also home to Don Saxton who was part of Canada's National Volleyball team for eight years and competed for Canada at the 1983 World Student Games and the 1984 Olympic Games, as well as Jaycee Gebhard, Bryn√§s IF forward and first-ever draft pick of the NWHL's Toronto Six.

When the target analyte concentration changes, the current through the transistor will change accordingly. Here, the analyte solution separates the source and gate electrodes. A concentration gradient between the solution and the gate electrode arises due to a semi-permeable membrane on the FET surface containing receptor moieties that preferentially bind the target analyte. This concentration gradient of charged analyte ions creates a chemical potential between the source and gate, which is in turn measured by the FET.  Construction  The schematic view of a ChemFET. Source, drain, and gate are the three electrodes used in a FET system. The electron flow takes place in a channel between the drain and source. The gate potential controls the current between the source and drain electrodes. A ChemFET's source and drain are constructed as for an ISFET, with the gate electrode separated from the source electrode by a solution. The gate electrode's interface with the solution is a semi-permeable membrane containing the receptors, and a gap to allow the substance under test to come in contact with the sensitive receptor moieties. A ChemFET's threshold voltage depends on the concentration gradient between the analyte in solution and the analyte in contact with its receptor-embedded semi-permeable barrier. Often, ionophores are used to facilitate analyte ion mobility through the substrate to the receptor. For example, when targeting anions, quaternary ammonium salts (such as tetraoctylammonium bromide) are used to provide cationic nature to the membrane, facilitating anion mobility through the substrate to the receptor moieties.  Applications  ChemFETs can be utilized in either liquid or gas phase to detect target analyte, requiring reversible binding of analyte with a receptor located in the gate electrode membrane. There is a wide range of applications of ChemFETs, including most notably anion or cation selective sensing. More work has been done with cation-sensing ChemFETs than anion- sensing ChemFETs. Anion-sensing is more complicated than cation-sensing in ChemFETs due to many factors, including the size, shape, geometry, polarity, and pH of the species of interest.  Practical Limitations  The body of a ChemFET is generally found to be robust. However, the unavoidable requirement for a separate reference electrode makes the system more bulky overall and potentially more fragile.  History  The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) was invented by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng in 1959. Dutch engineer Piet Bergveld later studied the MOSFET and realized it could be adapted into a sensor for chemical and biological applications. In 1970, Bergveld invented the ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET). He described the ISFET as \\"a special type of MOSFET with a gate at a certain distance\\". In the ISFET structure, the metal gate of a standard MOSFET is replaced by an ion-sensitive membrane, electrolyte solution and reference electrode. ChemFETs are based on a modified ISFET, a concept developed by Bergveld in the 1970s. There is some confusion as to the relationship between ChemFETs and ISFETs. Whereas an ISFET only detects ions, a ChemFET detects any chemical (including ions).

The park is in land area with submerged and of beach. It lies at the western end of Causeway Boulevard, which becomes Curlew Road east of Alternate US 19. Its address is 1 Causeway Blvd. Consistently receiving more than one million visitors each year, it is the most-visited state park in Florida. History Honeymoon and neighboring Caladesi Island were originally part of a large barrier island that split in half during a major hurricane in 1921. The waterway between the islands is known as Hurricane Pass.Gillin, Joshua. \\"Insider‚Äôs guide to Honeymoon Island: About the beach, planning your trip, where to park\\", Tampa Bay Times, Florida, 19 February 2018. Retrieved on 7 August 2019. According to the Florida Park Service, Honeymoon Island was introduced to the American public in the early 1940s through newsreels and magazines. The advertisements promised undiscovered pleasures for newlyweds. According to the Dunedin Museum (located in Dunedin, Florida on the mainland which lays claim to both Honeymoon Island and Caladesi Island), Honeymoon Island was formerly known as Hog Island. In the early 1940s, honeymoon-type huts were built on the island for vacationing, and the name was changed. After the US entered World War II, the thatched huts fell into disuse. The structures were soon worn down by the elements. The 1960s brought a developer with a plan to build a large residential area on the island by expanding the island to 3,000 acres. A causeway leading to the island was constructed in 1964. However, this plan was scrapped in 1969, when the developer's permit expired and the state prevented them from renewing it. The state purchased most of the island in 1974, then purchased the rest soon after. On December 7, 1981, Honeymoon Island State Park was created. One of the island's services, a ferry to Caladesi Island, is only for convenience to those in the Honeymoon Island area to reach Caladesi Island across Hurricane Pass. Caladesi Island is easily accessible by walking from Clearwater Beach, Florida, as it has been for decades, and it is only separated by a \\"welcome sign\\" from the south. Biology The barrier island park is a refuge for a number of species of plants and animals including Florida slash pines, mangroves, and several threatened and endangered species. Osprey and various species of tern, plover, herons, and wading birds reside on the island or stop during spring and fall migration. Dolphin pods are often sighted within yards of the shore. Starfish and other marine invertebrates are commonly found on the beach. In the autumn of 2008, a pair of bald eagles made a nest on Osprey Trail in the park. Assuming that the nest is still in place, visitors must stay back 300 feet; but the location is well marked and easily observed with binoculars. Mosquitoes are quite prevalent in the picnic areas and trails away from the beach, and can quickly inflict dozens of bites on uncovered, unprotected skin. Signs near the park entrance warn of this possibility. (Mosquitoes can also be a nuisance in the shower and restroom facilities.) Rattlesnakes are common to Honeymoon Island, so caution should be exercised. Recreational activities Activities include birding, fishing, hiking and sunbathing. Amenities include picnic pavilions, bathhouses, a park concession, nature trails, bird observation areas, a beach for pets, and a passenger ferry to Caladesi Island State Park. The Rotary Centennial Nature Center features exhibits about the natural and cultural history of Honeymoon and Caladesi Islands and an elevated observation deck.Leifermann, Henry. \\"Gone Fishing On the Bridges of Florida\\", The New York Times, Florida, 31 December 1989. Retrieved on 7 August 2019. The Osprey Trail (2 miles long) and the Pelican Cove Trail (3/4 miles long) circle the forested, eastern side of the island. On these trails you can find palmetto trees, an eagle nest, slash pine, and on the Pelican Cove Trail, some sea life and wading birds. Construction is underway in portions of the beach near the north concession area to mitigate extensive erosion which has taken place over the years. That part of the beach is closed, although there is a path one can use to access the north beach. The beaches range from sandy to covered in large chunks of fossilized coral. Some areas may have water puddles that emit a stench during certain months, but this does not deter swimmers from using the beaches. 10 miles off the coast is the veterans memorial Circle of Heroes. Hours, entrance fees, concessions Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays). While signage at the entrance to the park indicates a per-vehicle daily entrance fee of $8, single persons are only charged $4, as of February 2015. There is also an annual pass for those who wish to save on frequent visits. The charge to ride the ferry to Caladesi Island is $14 per adult in addition to the park entrance fee. Honeymoon Island has two different concession areas: Caf√© Honeymoon and the South Beach Pavilion.

He played college football at Morgan State University and Towson University. Professional career Meggett was used frequently as both a rusher and a receiver in his NFL career, but was primarily used to return kickoffs and punts on special teams. He led the league in punt return yards (582) in his rookie season, while gaining 577 kickoff return yards, 531 receiving yards, and 117 rushing yards, earning him a trip to the Pro Bowl. Meggett led the NFL in punt return yards again in his second season (467), helping the Giants record a 13‚Äì3 regular season record and a 20‚Äì19 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV. During the 1990 postseason Meggett saw his duties increase when starting running back Rodney Hampton went down with an injury. Splitting time with veteran back Ottis Anderson, he had a solid performance in the Super Bowl, recording 129 all- purpose yards (48 rushing, 18 receiving, 37 punt return, 26 kickoff return). After four more seasons with New York, Meggett signed with the Patriots in 1995. In 1996, he had the best season of his career, recording 1,966 all- purpose yards, earning his second trip to the Pro Bowl, and helped New England gain a berth in Super Bowl XXXI. Although his team lost the game 35‚Äì21 to the Green Bay Packers, his performance was solid, recording 155 total yards (117 kick return, 30 punt return, eight receiving). Meggett spent one more year with the Patriots before joining the New York Jets in 1998, and then retiring at season's end. In his ten NFL seasons, Meggett amassed 1,648 rushing yards, 336 receptions for 3,083 yards, 3,708 punt return yards, and 5,566 yards returning kickoffs. In total, Meggett gained 14,005 all-purpose yards and scored 29 touchdowns (eight rushing, 11 receiving, seven punt returns, one kickoff return). He also completed four of eight passes for 114 yards and four touchdowns. At the time of his retirement, his 3,708 punt return yards were the most in NFL history; he has since been passed by Brian Mitchell. Subsequent to his NFL career, Meggett was an assistant coach at American International College for over two years, and then moved to North Carolina. Personal life and prison sentence Meggett has nine children, including Davin Meggett, who grew up in Clinton, Maryland. He went to Surrattsville High School and played football at the University of Maryland. Meggett was one of the favorite players of coach Bill Parcells, playing for him on the Giants, Patriots and Jets. When Parcells coached the Dallas Cowboys, Meggett consulted with the team's punt returners during training camp. In 1990, Meggett was arrested for soliciting a prostitute, but was acquitted. He was charged with assaulting his then-girlfriend in 1995, but was acquitted after the judge found that the girlfriend was the aggressor and that Meggett had used \\"reasonable force\\" to keep her out of his house. In 1998, Meggett was arrested in Toronto after authorities said he allegedly assaulted an escort worker after a three-way sexual encounter. Following this incident, the Patriots promptly released him per their zero-tolerance policy for violence against women enacted after the furor of the selection of Christian Peter two years earlier. According to a 2014 report in SB Nation, the fallout from this incident led other teams to look askance at Meggett's past history with women, and was a reason why his number was never called by another NFL team after the Jets opted against resigning him. A trial on the assault charge ended with a hung jury in April 2000. In later years, Meggett faced multiple legal and financial difficulties related to his failure to pay child support. He'd earned over $10 million during his NFL career, but lost it all to back child support payments. He was even forced to sell his Super Bowl ring on eBay. Meggett was the parks and recreation director in Robersonville, North Carolina. Most of his salary was diverted to pay child support. He resigned in 2006, after he was accused of sexually assaulting his former girlfriend. In 2007, he was convicted of misdemeanor sexual battery in the case, receiving two years' probation. Authorities said he was allowed to move back to South Carolina to serve his probation. Soon afterward, in 2008, he was accused of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl, but prosecutors opted not to pursue the case due to questions about her credibility. In January 2009, Meggett was arrested for raping and robbing a part-time student at the College of Charleston. On November 10, 2010, Meggett was convicted of burglary and criminal sexual conduct, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Meggett, South Carolina Department of Corrections ID #00343610, is serving his sentence at Lieber Correctional Institution in Ridgeville, South Carolina. His earliest possible release date is July 6, 2034.South Carolina inmate record See also * History of the New York Giants (1979‚Äì93) References Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:African-American players of American football Category:American people convicted of burglary Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American football running backs Category:American football return specialists Category:American prisoners and detainees Category:American people convicted of sexual assault Category:Morgan State Bears football players Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:New York Giants players Category:New England Patriots players Category:New York Jets players Category:North Carolina Tar Heels football coaches Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Sportspeople from Charleston, South Carolina Category:People convicted of battery Category:Players of American football from South Carolina Category:Prisoners and detainees of South Carolina Category:Towson Tigers football players Category:Walter Payton Award winners Category:American sportspeople convicted of crimes ","title":"Dave Meggett"},{"id":"3644002","text":"Hermione Valentine Gullifordhttps://twitter.com/hermy1G/status/963841912213065728 is an English actress, born in Somerset.

Proposed as early as the 1870s, it was not opened until 1909 and was operated by the New Zealand Railways Department for half a century until its closure in 1959. Construction In the late 1870s, proposals for a railway line to or through Waikaia (then Switzers) and environs were seriously considered. These proposals were as part of the Waimea Plains Railway to link Gore on the Main South Line with Lumsden on the Kingston Branch and featured either a circuitous line that passed through Waikaia, or a direct line with a branch to Waikaia.\\"Projected Railways\\", Otago Witness 1369 (23 February 1878): 3. The Waimea Plains Railway was subsequently built on the direct route, and in 1880, a royal commission of New Zealand's railway network favoured an alternate route to the Waikaia area. It suggested that a line be built from Kelso on the Tapanui Branch. The previously proposed branch from the Waimea Plains Railway was favoured, however, as it had been argued that it would open up a considerable area of productive farming land, and in 1884, construction commenced northwards from Riversdale.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 113. The terrain made construction easy and ten kilometres of formation had been made with 3.2 kilometres of track laid before economic difficulties associated with the Long Depression brought work to a halt. At some point over the next twenty years, the track was removed to be used elsewhere. Work on the line recommenced by 1904; a combined road-rail bridge over the Mataura River, the only work of significance required for the line, opened in May of that year.\\"Opening of the New Switzers Railway and Traffic Bridge Over the Mataura River\\", Otago Witness 2616 (4 May 1904): 37. There were local fears that only the initial portion of the line would be built, but in 1905, the Undersecretary for Public Works and the distrinct engineer inspected the proposed route and felt that due to the agricultural land that would be served, it would be a mistake to terminate the line short of Waikaia township.\\"Riversdale-Switzers Railway: An Official Inspection\\", Otago Witness 2664 (5 April 1905): 23. By 1908, the 3.2 kilometres constructed in the 1880s had been fully relaid and beyond this point, construction was swift. The 22 kilometre long line opened on 1 October 1909. Stations The following were stations on the Waikaia Branch, in order from the junction at Riversdale:New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition, edited by John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 29. *Waipounamu *Plains *Waiparu *Freshford *Dome *Waikaia, originally Switzers, 22.19 km from the junction. Operation The Waikaia Branch was essentially a line to nowhere. Roughly 1,700 people lived in the area served by the line when it opened, and Waikaia was home to a mere 250 people.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 114. Photos of the grand opening, attended by Prime Minister Joseph Ward, show that the Waikaia station was essentially in the middle of a field. Initially, there was some traffic generated by gold mining and dredging near Waikaia, but the line was much too late to serve the gold fields of the 19th century and it mainly carried agricultural traffic. Its role was essentially to open up the surrounding land to farming and to provide a convenient link to major centres before the development of modern road transportation. In 1925, Ford Model T bus equipment was used as the basis for two railcars, the RM class Model T Ford railcars. They began operating on the Waikaia Branch as well as the Wyndham Branch in late May 1926 in an attempt to provide more efficient passenger service at a lower operating cost. They proved to be economical by the Railways Department's fuel consumption standards of the time, able to run 100 km on 18.8 litres of fuel. However, as the railcars rode roughly and were prone to overheating, they were unpopular with passengers and thus unsuccessful.David Jones, Where Railcars Roamed: The Railcars Which Have Served New Zealand Railways (Wellington: Wellington Tramway Museum, 1997), 10. The line became freight only from 9 February 1931. By the 1950s, the region's population had dwindled to a meagre 200 and trains ran twice weekly. What traffic did exist - mainly livestock and agricultural lime - was being transferred to the expanding road network. With no reason to justify the line's continued existence, the Waikaia Branch closed on 16 May 1959. = Motive power = In the early years of the line, small tank locomotives such as the F class were used to run trains from the junction in Riversdale, but in the later years, considerably larger tender locomotives such as the A class were used. Apart from the 1926-31 experiment with the Model T Ford railcars, the line was always operated by steam locomotives; it closed before dieselisation began in Southland to any substantial degree. The branch today It is not unusual for relics from closed railway lines to deteriorate and disappear over time, but remnants can be found the length of the Waikaia Branch. Much of the formation is still visible from local roads, and bridge foundations remain at a number of stream crossings. Freshford station still possesses its loading bank, sheepyard, and goods shed, which are preserved by local residents. A loading bank and ramp for sheep to board wagons remained in Waipounamu until being removed in the late 1990s or early 2000s to allow for other development. In Waikaia, the locomotive water tank has been preserved by the locals, and on its side, \\"Switzers - Estd 1909\\" is written in large letters. Nearby, the goods shed remained standing, with both \\"Switzers\\" and \\"Waikaia\\" visible on the ends, until it collapsed in 2005. The water tank also collapsed around this time but was restored.

He is a professor of Applied Mathematics and was the Dean of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Biography  Sipser was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and moved to Oswego, New York when he was 12 years old. He earned his BA in mathematics from Cornell University in 1974 and his PhD in engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1980 under the direction of Manuel Blum.Trafton, Anne, \\"Michael Sipser named dean of the School of Science: Sipser has served as interim dean since Marc Kastner‚Äôs departure\\", MIT News Office, June 5, 2014 He joined MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science as a research associate in 1979 and then was a Research Staff Member at IBM Research in San Jose. In 1980, he joined the MIT faculty. He spent the 1985-1986 academic year on the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley and then returned to MIT. From 2004 until 2014, he served as head of the MIT Mathematics department. He was appointed Interim Dean of the MIT School of Science in 2013 and Dean in 2014.MIT Mathematics  People Directory He served as Dean until 2020, when he was followed by Nergis Mavalvala. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2015 he was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \\"for contributions to complexity theory and for leadership and service to the mathematical community.\\". He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2017.  Scientific career  Sipser specializes in algorithms and complexity theory, specifically efficient error correcting codes, interactive proof systems, randomness, quantum computation, and establishing the inherent computational difficulty of problems. He introduced the method of probabilistic restriction for proving super-polynomial lower bounds on circuit complexity in a paper joint with Merrick Furst and James B. Saxe. Their result was later improved to be an exponential lower bound by Andrew Yao and Johan H√•stad. In an early derandomization theorem, Sipser showed that BPP is contained in the polynomial hierarchy, subsequently improved by Peter G√°cs and Clemens Lautemann to form what is now known as the Sipser-G√†cs-Lautemann theorem. Sipser also established a connection between expander graphs and derandomization. He and his PhD student Daniel Spielman introduced expander codes, an application of expander graphs. With fellow graduate student David Lichtenstein, Sipser proved that Go is PSPACE hard. In quantum computation theory, he introduced the adiabatic algorithm jointly with Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, and Samuel Gutmann. Sipser has long been interested in the P versus NP problem. In 1975, he wagered an ounce of gold with Leonard Adleman that the problem would be solved with a proof that P‚â†NP by the end of the 20th century. Sipser sent Adleman an American gold eagle coin in 2000 because the problem remained (and remains) unsolved.  Notable books  Sipser is the author of Introduction to the Theory of Computation, a textbook for theoretical computer science.  Personal life  Sipser lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts with his wife, Ina, and has two children: a daughter, Rachel, who graduated from New York University, and a younger son, Aaron, who is an undergraduate at MIT.

Life Liu Xi was Liu Yao's son by his first empress (but not first wife) Yang Xianrong, formerly the empress of Emperor Hui of Jin. After he became emperor in 318 following Jin Zhun's coup against the emperor Liu Can, he created her empress in 319 and created Liu Xi crown prince. She died in 322. Following her death, a succession question came about. Liu Xi's older brother Liu Yin, Liu Yao's prior heir apparent, whom Liu Yao had assumed to have been killed in Jin Zhun's coup, had in fact escaped but was taken as a slave by the Heiniyuju (ÈªëÂåøÈÉÅÈû†) tribe. In 323, Liu Yin revealed his identity to the chief of the tribe, who promptly delivered him back to his father. Liu Yao considered replacing Liu Xi with Liu Yin, since Liu Yin was previously his heir, but Liu Yin's uncle Bu Tai (ÂçúÊ≥∞) and another official Han Guang (ÈüìÂª£) spoke against it, and Liu Yin himself personally declined to replace Liu Xi. Liu Yao let Liu Xi remain crown prince, while granting Liu Yin special honors, including requiring Liu Xi to yield to Liu Yin as an older brother in ceremonies, rather than for Liu Yin to yield to Liu Xi as the crown prince. The relationship between the brothers appeared to remain cordial until their deaths. Around the new year of 329, Liu Yao was captured in battle by Later Zhao forces. Liu Xi became effectively acting emperor, and after consulting with Liu Yin, he decided to withdraw from the capital Chang'an west to Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), the capital of the mountainous Qin Province (Áß¶Â∑û, modern eastern Gansu), considered more easily defensible. However, the withdrawal caused a panic, and all Han Zhao generals abandoned their positions and fled to Qin Province as well, easily yielding most of remaining Han Zhao territory to Later Zhao. In fall 329, Han Zhao forces, under Liu Yin's command, tried to recapture Chang'an. Initially, he had some successes and recaptured much of the territory lost to Later Zhao. However, as he sieged Chang'an, the Later Zhao general Shi Hu arrived and defeated him. Liu Yin retreated toward Shanggui, and Shi Hu trailed him and defeated him again, capturing Shanggui. He killed Liu Xi, Liu Yin, along with all Han Zhao princes and high-level officials and generals. He forcibly relocated all other officials and the large clans of Qin and Yong (ÈõçÂ∑û, modern central and northern Shaanxi) Provinces to the Later Zhao capital Xiangguo (Ë•ÑÂúã, in modern Xintai, Hebei), and massacred, in Luoyang, the members of the Xiongnu nobility.

Upon initial 1974 release in West Germany and the United States Blood for Dracula was released as Andy Warhol's Dracula. The film involves Count Dracula arriving in Italy to feast upon the blood of virgins, only to find difficulty with this due to the lack of virgins present in Italy. Filming began shortly after the completion of Flesh for Frankenstein. Italian director Antonio Margheriti is credited in Italian prints of the film despite not directing it. This misattribution led both producer Carlo Ponti and Margheriti to be put on trial for \\"continued and aggravated fraud against the state\\" by attempting to gain benefits by law for Italian films. According to the American Film Institute, the film opened to mixed reviews. Plot In the first years of the 1920s, a sickly and dying Count Dracula, who, as a vampire, must drink virgin blood to survive, travels from Transylvania to Italy just before the rise of Mussolini into power, following his servant Anton's plan and thinking he will be more likely to find a virgin in a Catholic country. At the same time, all of Dracula's family has vanished because of two reasons, the lack of virgins in their hometown and how the family's reputation prevents any normal family from choosing to bring women to the renowned castle. Shortly after arriving in Italy, Dracula befriends Il Marchese di Fiore (de Sica), an impecunious Italian landowner who, with a lavish estate falling into decline, is willing to marry off one of his four daughters to the wealthy aristocrat. Of di Fiore's four daughters, Saphiria and Rubinia regularly enjoy the sexual services of Mario, the estate handyman, a proud peasant and staunch Marxist who believes that the socialist revolution will happen soon in his country. Esmeralda and Perla (eldest and youngest, respectively) are virgins; Esmeralda thought too plain and past her prime for marriage and Perla only 14 years old (portrayed by 23-year-old Dionisio). Dracula obtains assurances that all the daughters are virgins and drinks the blood of the two who are considered marriageable. However, their \\"tainted\\" blood reveals to him the truth and makes him even weaker. Nevertheless, he is able to turn the two girls into his telepathic slaves. Soon after the Marchese di Fiore travels out of Italy to pay his great debts, Mario discovers that Dracula is a vampire and what he has done to the di Fiore sisters. When he realizes the danger Dracula poses to Perla, the youngest, he uses the excuse of protecting her to rape her. Mario then warns di Fiore's wife, La Marchesa di Fiore, about Dracula's plan. Meanwhile, Dracula has drunk the blood of the eldest di Fiore daughter Esmeralda, turning her into a vampire and regaining strength. La Marchesa confronts, and is stabbed by, Anton, whom she shoots and kills before dying. Mario dismembers Dracula with an axe, killing him and Esmeralda with a stake, and becomes the de facto master and manager of the estate.

The original idea came from director Roman Polanski who had met Morrissey when promoting his film What? with Morrissey stating that Polanski felt he would be \\"a natural person to make a 3-D film about Frankenstein. I thought it was the most absurd option I could imagine.\\" Morrissey convinced Ponti to not just make one film during this period, but two which led to the production of both Flesh for Frankenstein and Blood for Dracula. One day after the principal shooting for Flesh for Frankenstein was completed, Morrissey had Udo Kier, Dallesandro and Arno Juerging to get shorter hair cuts as filming for Blood for Dracula began immediately. The film featured other directors in the cast, including Vittorio De Sica who wrote his own lines on the set. Roman Polanski also made a cameo in a tavern scene. Despite other sources' claims, Polanski was not shooting What? at the time in Italy, as that film had already been released in Italy by the time the film Blood for Dracula went into production. On its release, the film was promoted with Andy Warhol's name. When asked about how he contributed to the film, Warhol responded that \\"I go to the parties,\\" following up that \\"All of us at The Factory contribute ideas.\\" Italian credits of the film give different credits, including stating Tonino Guerra wrote the screenplay and story, and Franca Silvi edited the film opposed to Jed Johnson. Antonio Margheriti is credited as the director in the Italian prints, which he later claimed was not true, but that he did direct scenes with Silvia Dionisio and Vittorio de Sica. Udo Kier has stated that other cast members and himself only received direction from Morrissey and that he never saw Margheriti on the set. Margheriti credit was due to Carlo Ponti having an Italian credited in order to obtain benefits by law for Italian films. Ponti and Margheriti were both put on trial later \\"continued and aggravated fraud against the state\\". Release Blood for Dracula was first released as Andy Warhol's Dracula in both West Germany on 1 March 1974 and the United States on 6 November 1974. A 98-minute version was released theatrically by Euro International Film in Italy on 14 August 1975 as Dracula cerca sangue di vergine e...mor√¨ di sete!!! (). In Italy, the film grossed a total of 345,023,314 Italian lire. In the United Kingdom, the film passed with cuts to 103 minutes, avoiding being labeled as a video nasty. It was eventually released in England in 1995 without any cuts. Louis Periano, who distributed the film in the United States, later tried to cash in the success of Mel Brooks' film Young Frankenstein and re-released the film as a 94-minute R-rated Young Dracula in 1976 (as opposed to the original X-rated version). Reception According to the American Film Institute, the film opened to mixed reviews. The Hollywood Reporter lauded the production design by Enrico Job and Luigi Kuveiller's photography. The Los Angeles Times review described the film as \\"aesthetically pleasing\\" and \\"pretty funny up until that Grand Guignol finale\\" but felt that Morrissey had too much talent for \\"such sickening junk.\\" See also * Vampire film * Andy Warhol filmography References =Bibliography= * * External links  *Blood for Dracula an essay by Maurice Yacowar at the Criterion Collection Category:Dracula films Category:1974 films Category:1974 horror films Category:Italian films Category:Italian horror films Category:Italian LGBT- related films Category:French films Category:French horror films Category:French LGBT-related films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Paul Morrissey Category:Films set in Italy Category:Films set in Rome Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Films shot in Serbia Category:Incest in film Category:Italian independent films Category:LGBT-related horror films Category:French independent films Category:Films set in Serbia ","title":"Blood for Dracula"},{"id":"3644035","text":"Michael Dante Mori, also known as Dan Mori (born October 4, 1965), is an American lawyer who attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the United States Marine Corps.

On 30 November 1966 the Garrison Historic Area was the location where the ceremony was held for the lowering of the Union Flag (the flag of the United Kingdom), and the raising of the Barbados flag, thus ushering in full independence for the country of Barbados from the United Kingdom. There are a number of historically significant buildings at the location, other than George Washington House. Many of these housed the Regiment units of the British Garrison, including the building that houses the Barbados Museum and surrounding buildings. Evidence of this includes prison cells of the former Garrison.

Here, R is the distance from the origin while r is the distance from the central axis of a cylinder as in the (r,\\\\phi,z) cylindrical coordinate system. Here the notation for Bessel functions follows the German convention, to be consistent with the original notation used by Sommerfeld. The function I_0(z) is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind, better known by the notation I_0(z)=J_0(iz) in English literature. This identity is known as the Sommerfeld Identity. In alternative notation, the Sommerfeld identity can be more easily seen as an expansion of a spherical wave in terms of cylindrically-symmetric waves: : \\\\frac{{e^{ik_0 r} }} {r} = i\\\\int\\\\limits_0^\\\\infty {dk_\\\\rho \\\\frac J_0 (k_\\\\rho \\\\rho )e^{ik_z \\\\left z \\\\right} } Where : k_z=(k_0^2-k_\\\\rho^2)^{1/2} The notation used here is different form that above: r is now the distance from the origin and \\\\rho is the radial distance in a cylindrical coordinate system defined as (\\\\rho,\\\\phi,z). The physical interpretation is that a spherical wave can be expanded into a summation of cylindrical waves in \\\\rho direction, multiplied by a two-sided plane wave in the z direction; see the Jacobi-Anger expansion. The summation has to be taken over all the wavenumbers k_\\\\rho. The Sommerfeld identity is closely related to the two-dimensional Fourier transform with cylindrical symmetry, i.e., the Hankel transform. It is found by transforming the spherical wave along the in-plane coordinates (x,y, or \\\\rho, \\\\phi) but not transforming along the height coordinate z.

Gregoletto was in the studio with Jason Suecof next to where Trivium were demoing, and was told by Suecof that they needed a bass player. After jamming with other members, Gregoletto agreed to record for Ascendancy and tour to promote it with the band. Gregoletto originally had no intentions of staying with Trivium, but wanted touring experience.http://thescreamqueen.com/TriviumInterview.html He joined just in time for the tour Trivium booked with Machine Head. Apart from playing bass, he also is capable of playing the guitar. He has been a songwriter for Trivium since The Crusade, on which he composed the songs \\"To The Rats\\" and \\"The Rising\\" on his own, as well as being the co-writer of \\"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\\" with Matt Heafy. He also wrote the intro riff for the track \\"Throes of Perdition\\" while playing guitar.

Gregoletto has also recently opened an online forum. Since 2013 he has written a monthly column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine. Technique Gregoletto performing in 2006. In an interview with Bass Guitar magazine (July/August), Gregoletto revealed that he uses a variety of techniques to perform his basslines, as is typical of modern bassists. While he primarily used a pick to perform during the tour for Ascendancy, he now more frequently adopts a two fingered plucking style to pick out the more elegant counter-melodies and rapid pentatonic accompaniments necessary for some of Trivium's material. He will also frequently use a three-fingered plucking style, as favored by Billy Sheehan, in order to achieve a gallop rhythm (one eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes) in the style of Iron Maiden's Steve Harris. In the same article, he revealed that he prefers to warm up by performing chromatic exercises up and down the whole neck of the bass, using both plucking and picking styles. Paolo performs bass solos on the following songs: \\"Becoming the Dragon\\", \\"Broken One\\", \\"Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis\\", and \\"Incineration: The Broken World\\".

He pitched for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Kansas City Royals, Chicago White Sox, and Houston Astros in seven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Although he debuted in the major leagues in 2006 and had worked mostly as a starter in the minor leagues, he did not become a regular MLB starter until 2011. Humber earned three Texas Little League state championships. He subsequently attended Carthage High School in Carthage, Texas, where he led the baseball team to the state championship game in 2001, his senior season, winning state Player of the Year honors. He then attended Rice University, where he played college baseball for the Rice Owls baseball team. Humber was the winning pitcher in the clinching game of the 2003 College World Series. He has also represented the United States at the World University Baseball Championship. The Mets selected Humber with the third overall selection in the 2004 MLB draft. During his minor league career, he underwent ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction, before making his MLB debut with the Mets. It took him several years to regain his ability to throw with the same velocity that he had prior to the injury. After being included in a trade to the Twins for Johan Santana, Humber struggled to establish himself. He spent a year with the Royals organization and was briefly a member of the Oakland Athletics organization, before being claimed on waivers by the White Sox in 2011, getting an opportunity to pitch in the White Sox' starting rotation. On April 21, 2012, Humber pitched the 21st perfect game in MLB history, defeating the Seattle Mariners. Early life Born in Nacogdoches, Texas, Humber was raised in Carthage, Texas. Living in an area with an abundance of baseball fields, Humber grew up with a batting cage in his backyard. At the age of 11, Humber visited the Chicago White Sox during spring training in Florida as the guest of Robert Ellis, a family friend of the Humbers, who then was a minor league baseball pitcher for the White Sox. Carthage was a Texas anomaly, its baseball athletes being the most admired role models rather than its football players. As of 2004, the Panola County Dixie League teams had won 15 state championships in the preceding 20 years and Humber played for three state champions. Amateur career Humber attended Carthage High School. The Carthage Bulldogs had won the state title in 1990 and been one of the final four teams in the state tournament in 1994. Humber was promoted from junior varsity midway through his sophomore season. He compiled a 4‚Äì0 win‚Äìloss record with a low 1.09 earned run average (ERA). He went 7‚Äì2 as a junior, and posted a 13‚Äì1 record with a 0.90 ERA and 146 strikeouts as a senior. A capable batter, he also had a .371 batting average with six home runs. Humber threw a shutout in the Texas University Interscholastic League Class 4A semifinals against Cedar Park High School in 2001, his senior season. Although Carthage lost the state championship to Western Hills High School in baseball that year, Humber was named Texas High School Class 4A Player of the Year by the Texas Sports Writers Association. According to former Major League Baseball prospect and East Texas native Alan Move: \\"Back in high school, he (Humber) threw harder than everyone else and changed speeds pretty well and that's all you need in high school.\\" Humber was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 29th round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. As the 875th pick overall, he described himself as \\"more of a draft-and-follow\\" prospect. The Yankees made Humber an offer in an attempt to lure him away from his college scholarship, but he did not sign, choosing instead to attend Rice University in order to play college baseball for the Rice Owls baseball team, competing in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) of NCAA Division I. At Rice, Humber was coached by Wayne Graham. Humber's first home appearance at Reckling Park was in the annual Rice Alumni game in February 2002. After retiring his first two batters in relief, Humber faced a pair of Major League Baseball players. Jos√© Cruz, Jr. bounced the baseball off of the wall in center field and then Lance Berkman hit the ball over the scoreboard. After his inauspicious debut, he became a dominant pitcher during his three college seasons for the Rice Owls, stepping into the nationally ranked Owls' starting rotation as a freshman. Humber finished his freshman season in 2002 with an 11‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record, a 2.78 ERA, and a WAC-leading 130 strikeouts in innings, earning National Freshman Player of the Year honors from Collegiate Baseball and All-America honors from several publications‚ÄîCollegiate Baseball (Second Team), Baseball America (Second Team) and Baseball Weekly (Third Team). Humber's strikeout total was the most for an Owl freshman since 1976. That season, Rice reached the 2002 College World Series, but lost its first two games and was eliminated. Nonetheless, Humber earned an invitation to USA Baseball's national team trials. He was the scheduled starter in the second of the two games, which was against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish on June 17, but the team could not hold a 3‚Äì2 lead in the bottom of the ninth. He then competed for the United States national baseball team at the 2002 World University Baseball Championship, which was held in Messina, Sicily. On August 7, he earned a victory for the United States in a game against the South Korean team. The United States won the silver medal in the tournament. Entering his sophomore season, he was expected to be a key part of the starting pitching rotation. The 2003 season saw the development of Rice's \\"Big Three\\" rotation, featuring Humber and sophomore classmates Wade Townsend and Jeff Niemann. Humber developed a curveball that season, to augment his arsenal that included a fastball, changeup and split-finger fastball. During the season, Humber achieved his 17th consecutive win in WAC play. He was recognized as a Third Team All-American by Collegiate Baseball and was a First Team All-Western Athletic Conference honoree. The trio entered the 2003 College World Series with gaudy numbers ‚Äî Niemann (16‚Äì0, 1.63 ERA) and Townsend (10‚Äì1, 1.90 ERA) complementing Humber ‚Äî and with Humber scheduled for the third game, if necessary. Humber finished with an 11‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record with a 3.30 ERA, as Rice won its first national championship in any team sport. He pitched a complete game in the decisive third game of the series, a 14‚Äì2 win over the Stanford Cardinal. The game established a College World Series record for largest title game margin of victory. During the season, Rice established a school record 30-game winning streak. Upon his becoming the College World Series hero, June 26, 2003 was declared 'Philip Humber Day' in his hometown of Carthage, Texas in his honor. Following the season, all three pitchers competed in collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League; Humber pitched for the Yarmouth‚ÄìDennis Red Sox. Baseball America rated Humber as the seventh-best prospect in the Cape Cod League. In his junior season of 2004, Humber compiled a 13‚Äì4 win‚Äìloss record and 2.27 ERA. He struck out 154 batters and issued only 37 walks in 115 innings. He also set the Rice single-game record for strikeouts when he struck out 17 Hawaii Rainbow Warriors hitters on March 20, 2004. Rice entered the 64-team NCAA Baseball tournament as one of the eight national seeds. In the first game of the regional round of the tournament, Rice was upset by the Texas Southern Tigers. Humber entered the next game against the Texas A&M; Aggies with the bases loaded and surrendered a first-pitch grand slam to Justin Ruggiano. For the season, Humber totaled 154 strikeouts in 115 innings pitched. Humber finished his three-year career with a 35‚Äì8 win‚Äìloss record and 2.80 ERA, striking out 422 in 354 innings pitched. Humber's totals rank him with the third most wins in Rice baseball history and second most strikeouts. Among his honors for the season were selection to the 2004 Louisville Slugger All-America team by Collegiate Baseball and the 2004 USA TODAY/Sports Weekly All-America team. During the inaugural year for the Roger Clemens Award, which designates the top college pitcher, he was one of 10 named semifinalists. He was also among the 10 finalists for the Dick Howser Trophy in 2004, in recognition of his performance as one of college baseball's top players. Following the early exit in the Houston Regional due to the upset by the Aggies, Humber looked forward to the Major League Baseball Draft. Niemann, and Townsend were all selected along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft ‚Äî the first time three teammates had ever gone so early in the same draft. Only twice had three teammates been taken in the first round, most recently when Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected in the first round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round. Professional career =New York Mets (2006‚Äì2007)= The New York Mets chose Humber out of Rice University with their first-round pick in the 2004 Major League Baseball draft, the third overall selection. The Mets chose Humber over Jered Weaver and Stephen Drew, who also received consideration, as they considered Humber to be the \\"safe\\" selection. They also scouted Justin Verlander, who the Detroit Tigers had chosen with the second overall pick. It was reported that the Mets preferred Verlander, and would have chosen him if the Tigers had selected Drew. On January 11, 2005, Humber and the Mets agreed to a five-year contract, ending a long holdout the day before the Mets began their two-day minicamp in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Humber and the Mets were motivated to complete a deal due to a change in federal tax law that made signing bonuses subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Social Security taxes. There is some discrepancy about the value of the contract. According to MLB.com, Humber received a combined $3.7 million signing bonus and contract from the Mets. The Houston Chronicle reported the contract to be a $4.2 million deal with a $3 million signing bonus and that Humber would fly to minicamp. Six months later, Lee Jenkins of The New York Times also reported the signing bonus to be $3 million, but he claimed the contract was for $5 million in total. John Manuel of Baseball America reported the contract was worth a maximum of $5.116 million, with $4.2 million guaranteed. Humber pitching for the New York Mets in 2007 spring training Baseball America rated Humber as the 50th-best prospect in baseball heading into the 2005 season. Humber entered spring training in 2005 with the Mets. There, he clashed with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson, who wanted Humber to adopt a different training regimen and change the manner with which he threw the ball to the plate. The Mets front office supported Humber, telling him to pitch how he felt comfortable. After the brief stint in spring training, the Mets assigned Humber to start his professional career with the St. Lucie Mets of the Class-A Advanced Florida State League, where, in fourteen starts, he posted a 2‚Äì6 win‚Äìloss record and a 4.99 ERA. Humber was then promoted to the Class-AA Binghamton Mets of the Eastern League. In one start, Humber gave up three earned runs in four innings. Humber left the game early due to elbow pain caused by bone spurs, which required ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (more commonly known as Tommy John surgery) to repair a torn ligament in his elbow. The surgery was performed by Dr. James Andrews of the American Sports Medicine Institute. Coincidentally, his Rice pitching teammates, Townsend (Tommy John surgery) and Niemann (arthroscopic shoulder surgery), also endured major surgeries that year. Rice coach Graham, who also coached MLB starters such as Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte in college, shied away from any blame, noting that all three missed out on fall league play by holding out. In spite of his arm surgery, Humber was named the 20th-best prospect in the Florida State League by Baseball America, which ranked him as the fifth-best prospect in the Mets organization following the season. On March 8, he was assigned to the Mets minor league camp. After rehabilitating from surgery, Humber resumed pitching with St. Lucie in 2006, posting a 2.37 ERA in seven starts. He compiled a 3‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record. On July 31, 2006, a year after his surgery, Humber was once again promoted to Binghamton, where he was 2‚Äì2 with a 2.88 ERA. He was an early September call-up when the Major League rosters expanded on September 1. However, Humber did not make his Major League Baseball debut until September 24, 2006. He made two appearances for the Mets as a relief pitcher, pitching two innings. However, Humber was unable to obtain his pre- surgery velocity. That fall, he began play in the Arizona Fall League but his participation was discontinued when he endured shoulder tendinitis. Before the 2007 season, Baseball America rated Humber as the fourth-best prospect in the Mets organization. That year, the Mets had nine pitchers competing for five spots in the starting rotation in spring training camp. √ìliver P√©rez, Tom Glavine, Orlando Hern√°ndez, and John Maine were the favorites for the spots in the rotation. Veterans Aaron Sele, Chan Ho Park and Jorge Sosa were also invited to camp so that the team could be patient with former first round draft choices Humber and Mike Pelfrey, who were considered the most promising pitchers in camp. Rated the 73rd-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America prior to the 2007 season, Humber competed for a spot on the Mets roster in spring training. However, Humber was optioned to the minor leagues during spring training in 2007. Assigned to the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), Humber had an 11‚Äì9 win‚Äìloss record and 4.27 ERA in 139 innings pitched. He allowed 129 hits and walked 44 while striking out 120 batters in 25 starts. For the season, Humber finished tied for fourth in the PCL in wins and had the tenth-best ERA. He had started the season by earning the PCL Pitcher of the week for the week ending April 22. That week he allowed 2 earned runs in 13 innings of work over two starts, earning a win on April 16 against the Nashville Sounds with six innings of work and suffering a blown save after seven innings against the Albuquerque Isotopes on April 21. He flirted with a no-hitter with the Zephyrs on August 22 when he entered the ninth inning without giving up a hit to the Iowa Cubs. In his subsequent start, he allowed only an unearned run on two hits over five innings, but he was removed from the game when a batted ball hit him in the shoulder. Humber was promoted to the Mets, again as a September call-up, on September 2. Though the Mets considered inserting him into the starting rotation immediately, they chose to start Pelfrey. Humber made two relief appearances for the Mets, on September 5 and 11. The Mets, having lost eight of their previous 12 games and seen their lead over the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East division race decrease from seven games to two, removed Pelfrey from the final rotation to give an extra day of rest to pitchers P√©rez, Maine, and Pedro Mart√≠nez, and gave Humber his first Major League start on September 26, 2007, against the Washington Nationals, choosing him over Dave Williams. Although the Mets raced out to a 6‚Äì2 lead, Humber allowed five runs in four-plus innings, receiving a no decision in a game the Mets eventually lost, 9‚Äì6. The decision to start Humber was seen as emblematic of the Mets' desperation. As George Vecsey wrote in The New York Times, \\"How did it come to this? How did the entire Mets' season come to depend so much on a young pitcher, Philip Humber, who had never started in the major leagues until last night?\\" He concluded his three Mets appearances in the 2007 season with a 7.71 ERA. =Minnesota Twins (2008‚Äì2009)= Following the 2007 season, the Mets began to discuss trading Humber to the Minnesota Twins in a package of prospects to acquire two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Johan Santana. Eligible to become a free agent after the 2008 season, Santana had rejected a proposed four-year, $80 million contract extension from the Twins. Assuming that he was unlikely to resign with Minnesota, the Twins began to shop him to other MLB teams. Humber during his tenure with the Minnesota Twins in 2008. On February 2, 2008, the Mets traded Humber, along with outfielder Carlos G√≥mez and pitchers Kevin Mulvey and Deolis Guerra, to the Twins for Santana. At the time Baseball America ranked Guerra, Gomez, Mulvey and Humber the second, third, fourth and seventh-best prospects in the Mets organization, respectively. During spring training, the Twins assigned Humber to Santana's former place in the Twins' clubhouse. While trying to earn a spot in the rotation, Humber compiled 11 consecutive scoreless innings in the Grapefruit League. By late March, Humber had a spring training ERA of 1.29. Humber spent most of the 2008 season assigned to the Twins' Class-AAA affiliate, the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He started off slow with a 0‚Äì5 win‚Äìloss record and a 5.83 ERA in his first nine starts. With Rochester, Humber eventually compiled a 10‚Äì8 win‚Äìloss record with a 4.56 ERA in 31 games. He finished with a 6‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record and a 2.67 ERA in the second half. His 4‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record with a 2.74 ERA in August earned him the Minor League Pitcher of the Month Award. The Twins promoted Humber in August 2008, and he appeared in five games for the Twins, all in relief. Humber pitched innings, and posted a 4.63 ERA and six strikeouts for the Twins. Following the 2008 season, Humber was out of options, and could not be sent to the minor leagues without first being subjected to waivers, where other teams could claim him. Humber made the Twins' Opening Day roster in 2009 as a long reliever. Humber struggled at the start of the 2009 season, pitching to a 12.46 ERA over innings, while giving up 11 hits and walking four batters. The Twins designated Humber for assignment on April 17, 2009 to make room on their roster for Juan Morillo, who the Twins had claimed off waivers from the Colorado Rockies. Humber cleared waivers and the Twins assigned him to Rochester. The Twins recalled Humber in August 2009 due to an injury to Francisco Liriano, but outrighted him to the minor leagues ten days later. Humber was granted free agency after the 2009 season. =Kansas City Royals (2010)= On December 15, 2009, Humber signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals, receiving an invitation to spring training. After he pitched to an 11.74 ERA in four spring training games, the Royals reassigned Humber to their minor league camp on March 22. Humber was assigned to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber was hit in the face on a line drive by Luis Cruz. After lying on the mound for a few minutes, he was able to get up and walk on his own to the dugout. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he received eighteen stitches. He earned the second PCL Pitcher of the Week Award of his career for play during the week ending August 1. He won the award based on having posted a complete game 4-hit 7-strikeout shutout against the Nashville Sounds on July 30. However, Humber began to regain the velocity he had lost following Tommy John surgery in 2005. Humber was called up by the Kansas City Royals on August 5, 2010, when Kansas City designated Jos√© Guill√©n for assignment. On August 25, Humber pitched three relief innings for the Royals against the Detroit Tigers and earned his first MLB win. He finished the 2010 season with a 2‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record and 4.15 ERA in eight games for the Royals, including one game started. He also appeared in 21 games, 20 of them starts, for the Omaha Royals, pitching to a 5‚Äì6 win‚Äìloss record and 4.47 ERA. The Royals designated Humber for assignment in December 2010, in order to make room on the roster for newly signed Jeff Francoeur. =Chicago White Sox (2011‚Äì2012)= In December 2010, the Royals waived Humber, and he was claimed by the Oakland Athletics, who had extra room on their 40-man roster at the time of the waiver claim. However, the team subsequently filled its 40-man roster and designated Humber for assignment later that off-season in order to make room on their roster for Guillermo Moscoso, who the Athletics acquired from the Texas Rangers in a trade during January 2011. The Chicago White Sox claimed Humber off waivers from the Athletics on January 18, 2011. He signed a contract worth $500,000 for the season. White Sox pitching coach Don Cooper worked with Humber, as he replaced his cut fastball with a slider and improved his pitching mechanics in the fashion originally recommended by Peterson in 2005. Philip Humber warms up on April 21, 2012, prior to throwing a perfect game Humber debuted with the White Sox in their third game in relief. He made two pitches, both of which resulted in hits and base runners that came around to score. With Jake Peavy injured at the start of the 2011 season, the White Sox gave Humber the opportunity to pitch in their starting rotation. On April 9, 2011, Humber won his first start with the White Sox, pitching innings and only allowing one run. Humber surprised the White Sox with his strong performance. On April 25, in the sixth start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, but with one out Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle. He finished with seven scoreless innings. He took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2‚Äì1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In early July, when he led the major leagues with innings pitched and held an 8‚Äì4 record with a 2.69 ERA, he seemed like a probable selection for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In mid- July, the White Sox switched to a six-man rotation. By early August, Humber was in a slump. Humber denies the extra rest affected his pitch command. He spent time on the disabled list with a facial bruise after Kosuke Fukudome lined a baseball into his face above the right eye on August 18. After he was hit, he was very concerned for his wife: \\"I thought, 'I've got to get up because she's in the stands,'\\" Humber said. \\"As soon as I went in [the clubhouse], I asked one of the guys to call her to make sure she knew I was OK.\\", adding \\"My main concern was cheering up my wife.\\" He appeared in one rehabilitation start for the Charlotte Knights of the Class-AAA International League. Humber pitched seven scoreless innings in his major league return. Humber completed his first full season as an MLB starting pitcher with a 9‚Äì9 win‚Äìloss record with a 3.75 ERA in 163 innings. As Humber performed better in the first half of the 2011 season (8‚Äì5, 3.10 ERA) than in the second half (1‚Äì4, 5.01 ERA), which he attributed to general fatigue, Humber decided to add during his offseason workouts. Humber signed a one-year contract in March for $530,000, above the minimum salary for a player with his level of MLB experience. In the first season in which he did not have to battle for a roster spot in spring training, he made his final spring training start in his home state near Rice at Minute Maid Park in front of many relatives. Although the 2012 Chicago White Sox's rotation was said to be made up of five number- three starters, Humber began the season as the number five starter. In Humber's 30th career start in MLB, he pitched the 21st perfect game in MLB history against the Seattle Mariners on April 21, 2012. It was the third perfect game in White Sox history after those thrown by Charlie Robertson and Mark Buehrle, and the 18th no-hitter in White Sox history. It was Humber's second start of the 2012 season and first career complete game. Humber was named American League (AL) Player of the Week for the week ending April 22. Humber went 1‚Äì0 with a 0.63 ERA in innings while striking out 16 over two starts that week, including the perfect game. He received a congratulatory phone call from President Barack Obama, a noted White Sox fan. Humber appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, where he read the \\"Top Ten List\\". Humber's perfect game will be memorialized with a plaque at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. After the perfect game, Humber struggled. He allowed 20 runs in his next three starts across innings. He missed one month of the season due to a right elbow strain. Following the acquisition of Francisco Liriano, the White Sox removed Humber from the starting rotation. =Houston Astros (2013)= Humber pitching for the Houston Astros in 2013 The Houston Astros claimed Humber off waivers on November 30, 2012. Humber made the Astros' starting rotation at the start of the 2013 season. Humber lost his spot in the starting rotation to √ârik B√©dard after opening the season with an 0‚Äì7 record and an ERA of 8.82. Humber was designated for assignment on May 12, after his record fell to 0‚Äì8 with a 9.59 ERA. After pitching in relief for the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the PCL, the Astros selected his contract on August 12, when they traded Wesley Wright to the Tampa Bay Rays. On October 3, the Astros declined a $3 million option for 2014, instead paying him his guaranteed $500,000 and releasing him. =Oakland Athletics= On November 2, 2013, Humber signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics, with an invitation to spring training. The Athletics assigned him to the Sacramento River Cats of the PCL. =Kia Tigers= On December 8, 2014, Humber signed a contract with the Kia Tigers of the Korea Baseball Organization. After pitching to a 6.75 ERA in 50 2/3 innings, Humber was released by the Tigers on July 20, 2015. Koogle TV =San Diego Padres= On December 10, 2015, Humber signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres. Humber retired on March 29, 2016. Pitching style Humber relied on five pitches. He had a four-seam fastball ranging from , a two-seam fastball (), a slider (mid 80s), a changeup (mid 80s), and a 12-6 curveball (). He used his slider against right-handed hitters but preferred to use his changeup and curveball as off-speed pitches against left-handed hitters. Humber favored his curveball in two-strike situations. He used a conventional \\"three-quarters\\" arm slot to deliver his pitches. Personal life Humber married his wife, Kristan, in November 2007. They were introduced by mutual friends in 2005. At the time of his perfect game, Humber's wife was nine months pregnant with the couple's first child, a son named John Gregory, who was born on May 1. Humber comes from a large extended family. Humber is a registered member of the Republican Party. He has the Bible verse Colossians 3:23 inscribed in his baseball glove. He undertook a charitable mission to the Philippines in the 2011‚Äì12 offseason with Brett Carroll, where they instructed children about baseball and Christianity. Josh Tomlin, an MLB pitcher, is a close friend of Humber. From nearby Tyler, Texas, Tomlin competed against Humber in high school, and the two train together during offseasons. Humber is currently a Tyler resident.

It occurs northwest- and southwestwards of the range of its sister taxon, the checkered woodpecker, in the Cordillera Patagonica and its foothills, and in another population in the Andes of Bolivia and the adjacent foothills. As the latter is isolated and differs in numerous respects, it is being considered to separate it as V. (lignarius) puncticeps. This species was long placed in the genus Picoides where it was, together with its sister species, considered something of an oddball. In 2006, Moore et al. published research on mtDNA COI and Cyt b sequences which suggests that the striped and checkered Woodpeckers are actually most closely related to the white-spotted woodpecker, Veniliornis spilogaster, a peculiar Picoides-like species which also was previously unique in its genus.

Plot summary Frank Ross (Cagney) is a crusading reporter for a big-city newspaper on the trail of a crooked district attorney, Jesse Hanley, who is running for election as governor of the state. At the Banton Construction Co., Ross sees Hanley and his accomplice Grayce (Jory) burning books and ledgers to thwart a possible investigation brought about by the paper that Ross works for. His editor Patterson backs Ross in getting Hanley but the D.A. decides to get rid of him, so frames him. Knocked out and covered in whiskey, he is put in a runaway car which collides with another, killing 3 young people and is thrown in prison for one to twenty years on a charge of automotive manslaughter. He meets a gangster, Stacey (Raft), who, as there is no death penalty in that state, is in for 199 years. They work in the twine-making room together and Stacey falls into Ross's debt when Ross doesn't implicate Stacey for a fellow inmate's stabbing that he thinks Stacey committed. Meanwhile, Ross's reporter friends outside are trying to help him win vindication by finding the real culprits but they are having no success. Stacey agrees to help Ross prove that he was framed if Ross helps him escape from a courthouse. They arrange that Stacey be named by Ross as guilty for killing of Limpy, another inmate and hated stool pigeon. Ross goes along with the plot, including a promise to tell no one about it, but antagonizes Stacey by tipping off his old newspaper, so that the court room is full of reporters. He escapes by leaping from a window but makes no effort to find the real culprits who were responsible for Ross's predicament. Ross, meanwhile, is implicated in the escape and after being beaten up by brutal guards, spends five months in \\"the hole\\" refusing to betray Stacey. This is solitary confinement where prisoners are handcuffed to the bars in the dark and fed bread and water once a day. Ross, who has become a bad character, is promised a chance at parole by the warden (Bancroft) if he reforms, but Hanley has become governor and appointed Grayce to head the parole board. Grayce turns Ross down, meaning he must wait another five years before he can try again for parole. Stacey is shamed by Ross's reporter girlfriend, Joyce (Jane Bryan), to carry out his promise. He finds the man who \\"fingered\\" Ross and gets from him the name of the man who framed him: \\"Polecat\\", who just happens to be a jailhouse informant widely disliked in the same prison. Stacey, impressed with Ross being a \\"square guy,\\" decides to go back to prison to force Polecat to confess. Stacey instigates a prison breakout as part of his plan and orders the prisoners to bring along Polecat. A vicious prison guard is killed and the warden and some of his men held as hostages, but the National Guard have been sent for and block the escape with machine guns, gas and hand grenades. Freed from the hole as part of the escape, Stacey forces Polecat to confess to framing Ross with the warden and his men as witnesses to vindicate Ross. All of the escaping convicts are killed, including the badly wounded Stacey, who forces Polecat to go with him and be killed so that he cannot recant his confession. Governor Hanley and Grayce are indicted for murder and Ross is freed.

The landmarked building was originally constructed for a synagogue, Kehilath Anshe Ma'arav. The church is notable both as an architectural landmark and for the cultural contributions by the congregation of the church. Located at 3301 S. Indiana Ave, the church is in the heart of Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood. History The building was designed as a synagogue by Chicago architects Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler, and built in 1890 and 1891. Originally, the structure was the home of Kehilath Anshe Ma'ariv , an important congregation in the development of Reform Judaism; Adler was a member, and his father was a rabbi. That congregation continues as K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Temple. A Baptist congregation moved into the building in 1922, forming Pilgrim Baptist Church. The church is credited as the birthplace of gospel music in the 1930s. Thomas A. Dorsey, the \\"Father of Gospel Music\\", was the music director at Pilgrim Baptist for decades. Albertina Walker, Mahalia Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Sallie Martin, James Cleveland, The Staples Singers, and The Edwin Hawkins Singers are among those who have sung at the church. Famous members of the congregation include Bessie Coleman. The church also hosted the funeral service of boxer Jack Johnson in 1946, and was prominent in the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered sermons at the church during the height of the movement. In 1973, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the building was designated a Chicago Landmark in 1981. It housed a large series of murals painted by the African-American painter William E. Scott between 1936 and 1937. Pilgrim's charismatic and forward-thinking pastor Junius C. Austin hired both Scott and Dorsey in the 1930s to increase the church's appeal making it one of the largest churches in the country in just a few years. Fire 22 December 2006 On January 6, 2006, a fire broke out that spread and gutted the building. Investigators concluded that the fire was started accidentally by workers performing roof repairs during a $500,000 restoration. The roofers were fitting metal coping, which is sealed with a blowtorch. Consumed in the fire were decades of historical records, along with boxes full of Dorsey's original sheet music. An elementary school across the street had to be evacuated, and the nearby Illinois College of Optometry building had windows destroyed by the high temperatures of the fire. Cars parked alongside the church were \\"virtually incinerated.\\" After the fire, the brick and stone of the outer walls still stood near-complete and were determined to be structurally sound. A steel support skeleton was later attached to the outside to brace the walls for a possible later reconstruction of the interior of the building and restoration of the fa√ßade. The congregation now meets in a building across the street from the burnt out structure. Reconstruction plans Following the devastating fire that destroyed all but the exterior masonry walls of Pilgrim Baptist Church, the congregation committed to reconstructing the church on the current site. Sufficient documentation exists to ensure an accurate reproduction of the church, allowing for necessary alterations related to current liturgical and code requirements. The target period for reconstruction of Pilgrim Baptist is the 1920s‚Äì1930s era. This period was chosen because it was during this time that, as Pilgrim Baptist Church, the most significant events associated with the building, including the rise of gospel music, occurred. At the same time, the building itself retained most of the physical elements that characterized its original design as a synagogue by Adler & Sullivan. The exterior of the structure will be reconstructed to include all of the character-defining features of its original construction, which survived into the 1920s. At the interior, the sanctuary will be reconstructed to include all of the character-defining features of its original construction, with necessary modifications to accommodate modern accessibility and church usage requirements. The August 2020 Midwest derecho caused significant damage to the structure but the damage was not expected to affect the reconstruction schedule. In popular culture Although some news reports confused the two buildings, this is not the same Pilgrim Baptist Church as that used as the \\"Triple Rock\\" church in the movie The Blues Brothers, which stands on 91st Street several miles to the south.

Lubitsch, Cruze, Seiter, and Humberstone were each responsible for a single vignette, Roberts and McLeod directed two each, and Taurog was in charge of the prologue and epilogue. The screenplays were scripted by many different writers, with Joseph L. Mankiewicz making a large contribution. If I Had a Million is based on a novel by Robert Hardy Andrews.Andrews, Robert Hardy. Windfall: A Novel About Ten Million Dollars. The John Day Co., New York, 1931 A wealthy dying businessman played by veteran actor Richard Bennett (real-life father of Constance and Joan Bennett) decides to leave his money to eight complete strangers. Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, George Raft, May Robson, Charles Ruggles, and Gene Raymond play some of the lucky beneficiaries. The 1950s television series The Millionaire was based on a similar concept.Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013 p 33 Plot Dying industrial tycoon John Glidden (Richard Bennett) cannot decide what to do with his wealth. He despises his money-hungry relatives and believes none of his employees is capable of running his various companies. Finally, he decides to give a million dollars each to eight people picked at random from a telephone directory before he passes away, so as to avoid his will being contested. (The first name selected is John D. Rockefeller, which is swiftly rejected.) =China Shop= * Directed by Norman Z. McLeod Henry Peabody (Charles Ruggles) is unhappy, both at work and at home. A bookkeeper promoted to salesman in a china shop, Henry keeps breaking the merchandise, meaning his \\"raise\\" results in his bringing home less money than before, something his nagging wife (Mary Boland) is quick to notice. After Glidden gives him a certified check, Henry shows up late for work and then proceeds to gleefully wreak destruction on the wares. =Violet= * Directed by Stephen Roberts Barroom prostitute Violet Smith (Wynne Gibson) checks into the most expensive hotel suite she can find and goes to bed ... alone. =The Forger= * Directed by H. Bruce Humberstone Eddie Jackson (George Raft) narrowly avoids arrest for trying to cash a forged check. With his prior record, if he were caught, it would mean a life sentence in prison. When Glidden presents him with his check, Eddie is delighted ... at first. However, he does not dare show his face in a bank, and none of his criminal associates believes the check is genuine. Frantic to leave town and desperately needing to sleep, the penniless man gives the check as security for a 10 cent bed in a flophouse. The manager secretly calls the police to take away what he thinks is a lunatic, and uses the check to light his cigar. =Road Hogs= * Directed by Norman Z. McLeod Ex-vaudeville performer Emily La Rue (Alison Skipworth) is very content with her life, running her tea room with the help of her partner, ex-juggler Rollo (W. C. Fields). Only one thing is lacking to make her satisfaction complete, and it is delivered that very day: a brand new car. However, when they take it out for a drive, it is wrecked when another driver ignores a stop signal. The heartbroken woman returns to her tea room, where Glidden finds her. She comes up with an inventive way to spend part of her great windfall. She and Rollo purchase eight used cars and hire drivers. They all take to the road in a long procession. When they encounter an inconsiderate road hog, Emily and Rollo immediately set off in pursuit and crash into the offender's automobile. They then switch to one of their spare cars and repeat the process, until they run out of automobiles. At the end of the day, Emily purchases another new car, but it too is destroyed in a collision with a truck. No matter. Emily tells Rollo it has been \\"a glorious day\\". This sequence was one of four written by Joe Mankiewicz,Brian Dauth , Joseph L. Mankiewicz: Interviews, University Press of Mississippi, 2008 p 49 and contains a reference to his hometown Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. =Death Cell= * Directed by James Cruze Prisoner John Wallace (Gene Raymond) has been condemned to the electric chair for killing someone during a robbery. After a tearful conversation with his wife Mary (Frances Dee), he is visited in his cell by Glidden. John is certain that his new-found wealth will save him, but it is too late. He is executed that same day, despite his protests. =The Clerk= * Directed by Ernst Lubitsch When clerk Phineas V. Lambert (Charles Laughton) receives his check in the mail, he shows little emotion. He merely leaves his desk, calmly climbs the stairs to the office of first the secretary of the president of the company, then to the office of the private secretary, and finally knocks on the door of the president himself. When he is admitted, Phineas blows a raspberry at his former boss and leaves. =The Three Marines= * Directed by William A. Seiter Glidden finds U.S. Marine Steve Gallagher (Gary Cooper) and his good buddies Mulligan (Jack Oakie) and O'Brien (Roscoe Karns) in the stockade for striking their sergeant. However, when Glidden gives Gallagher the check, Gallagher notices it is April Fools' Day and assumes it is a joke. When the three men are released, they immediately head for a nearby lunch stand to see Marie (Joyce Compton), the pretty waitress. They all want to take her to the carnival, but none of them has any money. Then Gallagher remembers his check and that Zeb (Lucien Littlefield), the stand's owner, is illiterate. He tells Zeb that the check is for $10 and gets Zeb to cash it. He and Marie head off to the carnival, but Gallagher cannot shake his pals. Then Mulligan becomes embroiled in a fight, his comrades join in, and the trio end up right back in the stockade. Through the bars, they watch dumbfounded as a fancily dressed Zeb steps out of a limousine, escorting an equally well-garbed Marie. =Grandma= * Directed by Stephen Roberts The last beneficiary is Mary Walker (May Robson), one of many unhappy elderly women consigned to a rest home run by Mrs. Garvey (an uncredited Blanche Friderici). Mrs. Garvey is a petty tyrant who enforces her rules rigorously, to the displeasure of her charges, especially the spirited, defiant Mary. Mary uses her money to turn the tables. She pays Mrs. Garvey and the rest of the staff just to sit in rocking chairs while she and the other residents have a wonderful time partying and dancing with their gentleman friends. Mary's spirit even reinvigorates John Glidden. Glidden ignores his doctor and looks forward to spending time with Mary.

Lymphangiosarcoma arising from cancer-related lymphedema has become much less common with better surgical techniques, radiation therapy, and conservative treatment. The prognosis, even with wide surgical excision and subsequent radiotherapy, is poor.  Treatment  The treatment of choice is a large resection or amputation of the affected limb. Radiation therapy can precede or follow surgical treatment. Tumors that have advanced locally or have metastasized can be treated with mono or polychemotherapy, systemically or locally. However, chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been shown to improve survivorship significantly. In cases of upper limbs, forequarter amputation (disarticulation of upperlimb along with clavicle and scapula) is preferred.  Prognosis  Early detection is key. Untreated patients usually live 5 to 8 months after diagnosis.  Incidence  In the 1960s, the incidence 5 years after a radical mastectomy varied from 0.07% to 0.45%.

Finan was released from WARF that October 27, and died that December 20. WARF changed back to a sports format on March 30, 2007; branded as \\"Sportsradio 1350\\", becoming an affiliate for Sporting News Radio. Its logo used a blue-and-gold color scheme, a nod to the University of Akron. In June 2009, WARF switched back to Fox Sports Radio, which it airs to this day. =Shifting focus to Cleveland= On January 27, 2020, WARF rebranded as \\"Fox Sports 1350 The Gambler\\", as it added programming from the BetR Network related to sports betting. The accompanying press release also formally repositioned WARF as a Cleveland market station, billing itself as Cleveland's Fox Sports 1350,Fox Sports 1350 The Gambler though the station's city of license assignment to Akron and transmitter site in Cuyahoga Falls remained unchanged.

She belonged to the same generation of folk revivalists as Joan Baez and Judy Collins. Her most famous song \\"500 Miles\\" is one of America's most popular folk songs. She was described by the English folk musician A. L. Lloyd as \\"far and away the best of American girl singers in the [folk] revival.\\" Hedy West played the guitar and the banjo. She played both clawhammer style and a unique type of three-finger picking that exhibited influences outside of bluegrass and old-time, such as blues and jazz. Early life and family influences She was born Hedwig Grace West in Cartersville in the mountains of northern Georgia in 1938. Her father, Don West, was a southern poet and coal mine labor organizer in the 1930s; his bitter experiences included a friend killed.In this interview, Don West states he was the preacher at Barney Graham's funeral: Oral History Interview with Don West, January 22, 1975. Interview E-0016. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) in the Southern Oral History Program Collection, Southern Historical Collection, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He co-founded the Highlander Folk School in New Market, Tennessee, and later ran the Appalachian South Folklife Center in Pipestem, West Virginia. Her great- uncle Augustus Mulkey played the fiddle; her paternal grandmother Lillie Mulkey West played the banjo. By her teens West was singing at folk festivals, both locally and in neighboring states. In the mid-50s she won a prize for ballad-singing in Nashville, TN. Many of her songs, including the raw materials for \\"500 Miles\\", came from Lillie West, who passed on the songs she had learned as a child.Ken Hurt, \\"Obituary: Hedy West, The Independent (London), Aug. 3, 2005. She used her father's poetry in several songs, such as \\"Anger in the Land\\". Her family's politics were also a lifelong influence. Her liner notes for 1967's Old Times and Hard Times, written from self-imposed exile in London, are a personal statement on the corrosive effect of the Vietnam War, claiming, \\"We'll be controlled by manipulated fear\\". (See Folk- Legacy Records.) While living in Stony Brook, New York, in the late 1970s, she donated her time and talents to numerous benefit concerts for unfashionable causes ‚Äî as did her fellow Appalachian-on-Long-Island, Jean Ritchie. Her songs were rarely if ever overt, topical protests. But her working-class mountain roots were in her voice and ran through everything she sang, highlighting the lives of marginalized blue-collar women including factory workers, servants, and single mothers. Education, career and later life Hedy West attended Western Carolina College.Carden, Gary, \\"Hedy West in Cullowhee, NC circa 1957,\\" Holler Notes (June 15, 2009) In 1959, she moved to New York City to study music at Mannes College and drama at Columbia University. When she arrived and saw the \\"Folk Revival\\" taking place, she realized that the music the Northerners were playing was in fact music she had heard every day growing up. She embraced her \\"folk\\" side and started performing it around New York. She later attributed some of her ability to get 'inside' her songs to her early training as an actress. She was embraced by the Greenwich Village folk scene (most likely in no small part due to the fact that she actually came from the tradition they were reviving), and was invited by Pete Seeger to sing alongside him at a Carnegie Hall concert. She was signed to Vanguard Records by Manny Solomon after an appearance at the May 6, 1961 Indian Neck Folk Festival. After being included on the 1961 compilation album New Folks for Vanguard, she soon made two eponymous solo records for the company. She moved to Los Angeles in the early 1960s, where she continued singing and later married. West performed at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964. In 1966, she appeared on Pete Seeger's Public Television series Rainbow Quest, in an episode headlined by Mississippi John Hurt. By this time, she was making regular visits to England. She then lived in London for seven years, making tours of the country's folk clubs, and appearing at the Cambridge festival and the first Keele folk festival as well as regular visits to Europe, especially Germany. She recorded three albums for Bill Leader and A.L. Lloyd at Topic Records ‚Äì Old Times and Hard Times (1965), Pretty Saro (1966) and Ballads (1967) ‚Äì together with another for Fontana, entitled Serves 'em Fine (1967). For a few months in 1962 she had been engaged to Roger Zelazny, who became a well-known science fiction writer. In 1968, in London, she married broadcaster Pete Myers (born Bangalore, India April 18, 1939; died Utrecht, The Netherlands December 15, 1998), one of the founding presenters of BBC Radio 1's Late Night Extra. Shortly thereafter ‚Äì date unknown ‚Äì they divorced. In the autumn of 1970, she moved from Great Britain to Stony Brook. She picked her elderly grandparents' brains for scraps of musical memory. She studied composition with David Lewin at Stony Brook University, living nearby with her husband Joseph Katz (1920‚Äì88), with whom she had a daughter, Talitha. She was an adjunct professor and taught two courses in folk music. One of her students, singer-songwriter Robin Greenstein, worked with her cataloging her record and tape collection. On return trips to Europe she made two further recordings. The first, Getting Folk Out of the Country (1974), was recorded in London with fellow American Bill Clifton and released by FV Schallplatten. The second, Love, Hell and Biscuits (1980), was released by Bear Family Records in 1976. She lived with her husband and daughter during the 1980s in Princeton, NJ. Then in the early 1990s, following the death of her husband, she moved to Lower Merion Township in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, suburbs, where she spent most of her final years. One of her last performances was at the Eisteddfod Festival, sponsored by the Folk Music Society of New York at Polytechnic University in 2004.Eisteddfod-NY West's most famous song was \\"500 Miles,\\" put together from fragments of a melody she had heard her uncle sing to her back in Georgia. She copyrighted the resulting patched song. \\"500 Miles\\" has been recorded by Bobby Bare (a Billboard Top 10 hit in 1963), The Highwaymen, The Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul and Mary, Peter & Gordon, Rosanne Cash, and many others. Another well-known song that she wrote and copyrighted (but which borrows heavily from existing traditional folk material) is \\"Cotton Mill Girl\\". Cancer ruined her voice in her last years. A fine musical legacy is in unreleased recordings, such as a live concert from the 1978 University of Chicago Folk Festival, broadcast in her memory by The Midnight Special program of local radio station WFMT. Hedy West died of cancer on July 3, 2005.

It was released on October 1, 1954 by Universal-International and portions of the film were shot in Tijuana.. Plot In a California city, Lt. Fred Parks interrogates local baker Albert Willis (Gene Barry) about his possible connection to recent eastside robberies. After repeatedly stating that he is innocent, Willis finally erupts in anger and punches Parks, who retaliates. Chief Joseph E. Conroy (Sterling Hayden) enters just in time to hear Willis threaten revenge but is compelled to release him because he has read that councilman Edgar Goodwin is calling for an investigation of police brutality. Willis returns to his wife Helen (Marcia Henderson), but slips out again that night and hours later, Parks is found shot. Joe takes on the case and immediately suspects Willis; however, he has only the bullets as evidence. When the police try to arrest Willis again, he runs away, falling on his head during the chase. He once again swears he is innocent, and after his lawyer, wife, and Goodwin hear about Willis's injuries, pressure is put on Joe. Forced to let Willis go, Joe instructs an officer to follow the baker. That evening, Willis slips into a church and disappears. Hours later, two more officers are killed and Joe goes to arrest Willis himself. When Willis provokes another fight, the altercation is witnessed by a reporter, and Joe is soon fired for brutality and labelled unbalanced. Undaunted, he asks his friend, private detective Matt Matthews, to help tail Willis. Over the next few days, Willis grows disturbed by the shadows following him and tells Helen that he must leave town to clear his head. He heads to Border City, located in Mexico, with Joe following close behind; there, the baker watches his girlfriend Marianna (Gloria Grahame) sing at a bar. Marianna knows nothing of Willis's other life and accepts his rough treatment because she loves him deeply. That night, Joe shows Willis's photo around town and is duped by a shyster who stabs, robs, and leaves him for dead. A young local boy named Petey finds Joe in the alley the next morning and, along with his uncle Charlie, minister to him in their apartment. When Marianna, who lives upstairs from Petey, comes by to help them, she pockets Joe's photo of Willis, which is captioned: \\"Killer or family man?\\" Later at a party hosted by Willis, she asks him to marry her, but he refuses, promising only to keep coming back to her. Marianna is then horrified to witness Willis throwing a clumsy waiter over an indoor balcony. She heads for home, followed by Willis, and while Joe watches from the window, Willis grabs her roughly and threatens her. Marianna runs inside where she attempts to extract information from Joe by flirting with him. He tells her nothing and, in retaliation, she puts sleeping powder in his coffee. When she leaves, Joe follows, not realizing he has been drugged. He hides in the alley behind the bar where he hears Willis threaten Marianna again, and he attracts Willis's attention briefly when he stumbles as he leaves. The next morning, Joe readies to go, stopping only to say goodbye to Marianna who quietly talks to him about the big mistakes she has made. Meanwhile, Willis begins to believe that the \\"drunk\\" in the alley is Marianna's new lover and jealously storms into her dressing room. When she admits she knows he is married, Willis realizes the drunk was Joe and beats her. She runs to Joe's hotel room to warn him and, after seeing her bruises, Joe explains that he must prove Willis guilty in order to clear his own reputation. He shows her a telegram that reveals Willis's participation in a hijacking ring in the States. When Joe and Marianna step outside to deliver the telegram to the police, Willis and his goons ambush them and take them to the bar. Willis first tries to force Marianna to kiss Joe, then plans with his goons to create a ruckus and kill them incidentally. Meanwhile, Joe learns from Marianna that Willis never attends church and deduces that Willis must have entered church only to hide the gun. Just then, the goons start a fight and the bar erupts in confusion, allowing Joe and Marianna to race out the back door. Willis follows them and, in the back alley, Joe punches him and drags him into his car. The goons see the car and report the \\"kidnapping\\" to the police. In order to return to California to find the gun that will prove Willis' culpability, Joe and Marianna abandon the car and force Willis into the back of a truck. As soon as they arrive in California, Willis runs off. Knowing he will run to the church, Joe and Marianna follow him but police, having been given orders to arrest Joe, stop him and do so. Marianna goes to the church; Willis has retrieved his gun and subsequently takes Marianna hostage. When Joe then bursts in with the policemen, Willis drags Marianna onto the rooftop and barricades the access door. A chase ensues, during which Willis shoots Marianna before Joe can break through the door. He succeeds and kills Willis, who falls to the ground. Joe takes Marianna in his arms and she whispers that they should have met sooner. He then carries her to the street and a waiting ambulance; he then walks alone out into the dark city.

Luis Enrique T√°bara (born 1930 in Guayaquil, Ecuador) is a master Ecuadorian painter and teacher representing a whole Hispanic pictorial and artistic culture. T√°bara took interest in painting at the age of three and was drawing regularly by the age of six. In these early years, Tabara was strongly encouraged by both his sister and his mother. Enrique T√°bara nevertheless is a creator who investigates and demystifies the image in which he takes refuge. T√°bara's vitality is a constant that reveals the versatile spirit of a teacher and a master of experimentation. T√°bara was greatly influenced by the Constructivist Movement, founded around 1913 by Russian artist Vladimir Tatlin, which made its way into Europe and Latin America by way of Uruguayan painter Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a and Parisian/Ecuadorian painter Manuel Rend√≥n. Torres Garcia and Rend√≥n both made an enormous impact on Latin American artists such as T√°bara, An√≠bal Villac√≠s, Theo Constant√©, Oswaldo Viteri, Estuardo Maldonado, Luis Molinari, F√©lix Arauz and Carlos Catasse, to name a few.  The Barcelona Years  In 1946, T√°bara attended the School of Fine Arts in Guayaquil and was mentored by German artist Hans Michaelson and Guayaquilean artist, Luis Martinez Serrano. In 1951, T√°bara finished mastering the fundamentals and left art school. T√°bara's early works typically depicted grotesque characters, marginalized peoples of Guayaquil, prostitutes, and some portraits. By 1953, T√°bara began to paint more abstract images. T√°bara held his first US exhibit in 1954 at the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington, D.C. In 1955, the Ecuadorian government offered T√°bara a scholarship to study at the Escuela Official de Bellas Artes de Barcelona. T√°bara's work was welcomed with great success in Spain and T√°bara befriended surrealist Andr√© Breton and Joan Mir√≥. By 1959, T√°bara's work had gained a great deal of international attention. Andr√© Breton asked T√°bara to represent Spain in the Homage to Surrealism Exhibition, among the works of Salvador Dal√≠, Joan Mir√≥, and Eugenio Granell. Mir√≥ enthusiastically praised T√°bara's work and presented T√°bara with an original piece of his artwork which T√°bara has long treasured. While living in Barcelona, T√°bara began working with Antoni T√†pies, Antonio Saura, Manolo Millares, Modest Cuixart and many other Spanish Infomalist artists. T√†pies and Cuixart were members of the first Post-War Movement in Spain known as Dau-al-Set, founded by Catalan poet Joan Brossa. T√°bara wrote several articles for their publication of the same name, Dau-al-Set. Dau-al- Set was connected with Surrealism and Dadaism and its members sought a connection to both the conscious and unconscious in their work. Dau-al-Set opposed both the Formalist Movement and the formal art centers. The group was inspired by the early works of Max Ernst, Paul Klee, and Joan Mir√≥. In 1963, T√°bara represented Ecuador together with Humberto Mor√© and Theo Constant√© at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris for the Third Biennial of Paris. By 1964, T√°bara's work was being shown throughout Latin America, as well as Lausanne, Milan, Grenchen, Vienna, Lisbon, Munich, Barcelona, Madrid, Washington, New York and Paris.  Return to Ecuador  After living and painting in Europe for over nine years T√°bara felt that there was not enough being done in the name of Latin American Modern art so in 1964 he returned to Ecuador in search of a new aesthetic. T√°bara reconnected to his roots through the Latin American current of \\"Ancestralism\\", which finds inspiration in pre-Hispanic cultures that inhabited the continent (third stage). T√°bara is the first artist to use the Pre-Columbian motif as a search for a new aesthetic. Shortly after returning to Ecuador, T√°bara and Villac√≠s founded the Informalist art group, VAN (Vanguardia Art√≠stica Nacional), that was in opposition to the Indiginist Art Movement. VAN had a double meaning, from the avant-garde term, Vanguard, as well as, the Spanish phrase \\"se van\\" meaning, \\"they are going\\". In other words, the artists were moving on, away from Guayasaminism and Indigenist Art Movement that had been dominating the art scene of Ecuador for decades. VAN consisted of T√°bara, Villac√≠s, Maldonado, Cifuentes, Molinari, Almeida, and Muriel. VAN strongly opposed the Communist political views of Oswaldo Guayasamin and was in a constant search of new artistic pathways while never losing a connection to their Pre-Columbian roots.  Patas-Patas  Finally, T√°bara started to paint simple shapes inspired in nature, and also other simple structures, such as his famed \\"Patas-Patas\\", or Feet-Feet, as well as insects and shrubs. T√°bara is most known for his Patas-Patas works which contain legs with feet incorporated into the piece. When asked about this subject matter, T√°bara says that one day he was drawing a figure but he didn't like it, so he ripped it up and the feet of the figure landed at his feet, thus his fate. It has been suggested by some critics that T√°bara's use of feet was possibly a subtle statement in opposition to Guayasamin's use of hands. In some of T√°bara's Patas-Patas works, the legs are bold focal points that stand out clearly. In other works, the legs are more obscure or seem to be hidden within shrubs, bones or abstract forms. T√°bara is an artist who is in a constant, infinite search. He likes to experiment and live \\"pictorical adventures\\". He believes that in art one has to pose difficult problems for oneself and solve them on the canvas. Today, T√°bara is considered one of the most important artists of the last century and has been lauded as a national treasure in Ecuador. In 1988, T√°bara was awarded the Premio Eugenio Espejo, the country's most prestigious National Award for Art, Literature and Culture presented by the president of Ecuador. T√°bara continues to paint with a vigorous spirit in his home town of Guayaquil, Ecuador. Barcelona is considered T√°bara's home away from home.

VFC-13 uses \\"Bogey\\" as its main radio callsign. Cmdr. Andrew Craig from Marion Ohio relieved Cmdr. Brandon \\"Buda\\" Harjer as Cmdr. History Fleet Composite Squadron Thirteen (VC-13) was established on 1 September 1973 at NAS New Orleans, Louisiana when the US Navy reorganized the US Naval Reserve and the Naval Air Reserve Force (NAVAIRESFOR). The squadron first flew the F-8 Crusader, and had 17 officers and 127 enlisted men within its ranks, most were former members of VSF-76 and VSF-86. In April 1974, they made the transition to the A-4 Skyhawk. =1970s= The demand for West Coast adversary squadrons and other fleet support missions resulted in the squadron relocating to NAS Miramar, California in February 1976. In mid-1976, VC-13 added the two seat TA-4J to the single seat A-4L in their aircraft complement. =1980s= In 1988, the squadron returned to strictly single-seat aircraft when they transitioned to the A-4E, and in 1989 they upgraded to the more powerful A-4F. A-4Fs at NAS Fallon in June 1993 On 22 Apr 1988, the squadron was re- designated Fighter Composite Squadron Thirteen (VFC-13) and briefly transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet during 1992-93, which further enhanced the squadron's ability to perform its adversary mission by providing an even more capable and realistic threat aircraft. When Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action resulted in the transfer of NAS Miramar back to the US Marine Corps and its redesignation as MCAS Miramar, the Navy relocated the Naval Fighter Weapons School, or TOPGUN, to NAS Fallon, Nevada as part of the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center. =1990s= VFC-13 transferred to NAS Fallon in April 1996 and also made the transition to F-5E Tiger IIs. The unit's mix of 23 F-5E, F-5F and F-5N aircraft are all painted in a variety of colorful adversary schemes of blue, gray, or brown camouflage. =2000s= In January 2005, VFC-13 established a permanent detachment of 12 aircraft at NAS Key West, Florida for East Coast training. Subsequently, in late 2006, the VFC-13 Key West detachment was re-designated as a separate squadron, VFC-111, with an assignment of one F-5F and 17 F-5N. In parallel, the eleven aircraft strength of VFC-13 at NAS Fallon was increased to 14 F-5s. VFC-13 provides adversary training for Navy and Marine Corps Active and Reserve fleet and replacement squadrons, carrier air wings and Marine aircraft groups, USAF units, to include Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, and Canadian Forces. The squadron has received two consecutive CNO Safety Awards, the Golden Wrench Maintenance Award, and in 1994, the Battle \\"E\\" award. Personnel The squadron is manned with 69 Navy personnel including 33 enlisted and 36 officers. The 33 enlisted personnel provide critical operations, administrative, safety and training support to the squadron. Maintenance support is for the F-5N and is provided by civilians who work for Sikorsky Aircraft. The 40-member officer wardroom includes 25 Selected Reserve (SELRES), 5 Regular Navy and 10 Full Time Support (FTS) officers. These three elements combine to fly over 4,000 adversary sorties per year in support of US Navy Fighter squadrons and their air wings, as well as USAF, USMC and Canadian Forces.

It is the oldest performing arts organization in Florida and the seventh oldest opera company in the United States. FGO is the resident company at the Ziff Ballet Opera House, located in the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, and also at the Au-Rene Theater at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale. FGO also stages productions at the Miami-Dade County Auditorium in Miami, Miramar Cultural Center in West Broward county, and the Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale. In 1941, the company was founded as the Opera Guild of Greater Miami by Arturo di Filippi, a tenor and voice teacher at the University of Miami. It later became known as the Greater Miami Opera Association. FGO was created in 1994 from the consolidation of two opera companies in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale region: Opera Guild of Greater Miami, founded in 1941 by Arturo di Filippi; and the Opera Guild, Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, formed in 1945. Under the name the \\"Greater Miami Opera\\", Emerson Buckley was the company's music director from 1950 to 1973 and then served as artistic director and principal conductor through 1986. Willie Anthony Waters, who had become Chorus Master of the company in 1982, then served as artistic director from 1986 through 1992 and principal guest conductor from 1992 to 1995. Stewart Robertson was FGO music director from 1997 to 2010. On June 1, 2011, Ram√≥n Tebar became FGO's music director. He also became the first Spanish conductor to lead both an American opera company and an American symphony. In 2014, Tebar took the title of principal conductor with the company. In 2006, FGO moved its principal performing venue from the Dade County Auditorium to the new Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts. The company has since faced regular financial problems because of increased expenditure at the new venue, without a parallel increase in audience revenue. FGO has sold off its assets in recent years to meet these expenses. In October 2014, the general director of FGO, Susan Danis, announced a new fund-raising campaign with the goal of $17.5 million, and also discussed in a series of town-hall meetings the exacerbated difficulties of the company's finances.

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., the station serves as the local affiliate for American Top 40. The WKDD studios are located in the Canton suburb of North Canton, while the station transmitter resides in the Akron suburb of Cuyahoga Falls. Besides a standard analog transmission, WKDD broadcasts over two HD Radio channels,http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=73 HD Radio Guide for Akron and streams online via iHeartRadio. History =WTOF / WTOF-FM= In 1960, Edwin Mortenson moved to Canton, Ohio and began construction on a new 50,000-watt FM radio station: WTOF at 98.1 megahertz (MHz). Mortenson had tired of losing his radio ministry whenever a new station owner would come along and flip his affiliate's format; he resolved to build his own radio station to keep his religious shows on the air ‚Äì WTOF-FM was that station. Broadcasting a Christian format under the name \\"Tower of Faith\\" (the origin of the \\"WTOF\\" call letters), the station served the Canton area for decades, and was just the first of several stations to come under Mortenson's ownership ‚Äì the start of Mortenson Broadcasting. In 1985, the station changed its callsign to WTOF-FM after briefly owning WTOF (900 AM). =WHK-FM (98.1)= Station logo as In 1997, Mortenson opted to sell off WTOF-FM, and Akron-licensed station WHLO (640 AM), to California-based Salem Communications; soon the West Coast firm would change the station's callsign to WHK-FM. Salem had already purchased WHK (1420 AM) the previous year and flipped its format from news/talk to religious programming; the new WHK-FM would simulcast its sister station's content for the next few years. During this time, nationally syndicated area pastor Alistair Begg aired daily on both WHK and WHK-FM. In October 1997, both stations broadcast live from the \\"Stand in the Gap\\" rally held by Promise Keepers. In September 2000, WHK-FM joined Rock Contemporary Christian Radio Inc., a radio network airing contemporary Christian music. =2001 \\"frequency swap\\"= On July 3, 2001, WHK-FM was one of seven Northeast Ohio radio stations involved in a complex exchange between three radio companies. Although generally reported as a \\"frequency swap\\", in reality these seven radio stations mostly traded callsigns along with their respective formats and staffs ‚Äì all to facilitate the transfers of ownership of four of the seven stations. As part of this complex exchange, Salem Communications sold WHK-FM to Clear Channel Communications; both companies retained their respective on- and off-air staff. Clear Channel then changed the WHK-FM callsign to WAKS; and changed the station's format to hot adult contemporary (hot AC). Less than one month later, on July 23, 2001, Clear Channel changed the station's callsign to WKDD. In effect, this new WKDD (98.1 FM) licensed to Canton became the successor to the previous WKDD (96.5 FM) licensed to Akron. =98.1 WKDD= On October 29, 2008, the station became licensed to the Akron suburb of Munroe Falls, Ohio. WKDD had a construction permit to return to the Akron area broadcast facility once occupied by its 96.5 FM predecessor, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. On December 18, 2009, 30-year morning host Matt Patrick hosted his last show on WKDD. Longtime co-host Barbara \\"B.A.\\" Adams returned to join Matt for his last show (Matt soon became the morning show host at WTRC and WTRC-FM in South Bend, Indiana and later worked at KTRH in Houston, Texas). After playing \\"Home\\" by Michael Bubl√©, the new morning show \\"Keith & Krissy\\" was announced, hosted by WKDD Programming Operations Director Keith Kennedy, and Patrick's former co-host, Krissy Taylor. The station also changed their on-air branding at this time to \\"Akron's 98-1 The New WKDD\\" with the slogan \\"Akron's Hit Music Station.\\" Each February since 2000, WKDD teams up with Akron Children's Hospital for the \\"Have a Heart, Do Your Part Radiothon\\" to benefit the hospital. Radiothon airs live on WKDD all weekend long. The event was hosted for many years by Matt Patrick and Barbara Adams, and later by Angela, Keith and Krissy.[citation needed] On September 7, 2010, WKDD moved its signal back to its Cuyahoga Falls broadcast location, formerly used by the station in their 96.5 days, to improve the quality of its signal in the Akron area, especially northern Summit County. The station also adopted a slightly new format playing music from \\"the '90s, 2k and Today\\", however some 1980's songs are also in the playlist. In early 2012, WKDD gradually moved to a pop/contemporary hit radio (CHR) format. Current programming WKDD personalities Keith Kennedy and Kat Jackson host the weekday morning show. The majority of other programming is devoted to music, much of which is provided by the Premium Choice network. American Top 40, syndicated via Premiere Networks, airs Sunday mornings. The HD2 digital subchannel simulcasts the news/talk format of sister station WHLO/Akron; the HD3 subchannel airs religious programming.

The other three coastal California mountain ranges are the Transverse Ranges, Peninsular Ranges and the Klamath Mountains. Physiographically, they are a section of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the larger Pacific Mountain System physiographic division. UNESCO has included the \\"California Coast Ranges Biosphere Reserve\\" in its Man and the Biosphere Programme of World Network of Biosphere Reserves since 1983. Physiography Northern and Southern Coast Ranges and other major mountain ranges of California The northern end of the California Coast Ranges overlap the southern end of the Klamath Mountains for approximately 80 miles on the west. They extend southward for more than 600 miles to where the coastline turns eastward along the Santa Barbara Channel, around the area of Point Conception. Here the southern end meets the Los Angeles Transverse Ranges, or Sierras de los Angeles. The rocks themselves that comprise the mountains are of a great variety and widely varying geologic ages. Most of the rocks were formed during the Tertiary, Cretaceous and Jurassic periods. Most were deposited on the sea bottom as sediments, but in many places also had the cracks, crevices and other gaps infused with molten lava or other masses of igneous rock, which were forced in molten condition into the sedimentary rocks. All of the range has been folded and faulted during several periods, with erosion of the softer rock giving much of the current appearance. Mineralogy The California Ranges had a high production of mercury following the discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada. In the Cache Creek Basin, Cenozoic cinnabar deposits near Clear Lake are the northernmost of a group of similar deposits associated with volcanism and migration of a transform fault system. During 1877, these deposits hit their peak production of mercury, producing approximately 2,776 metric tons. These abandoned mines are still a source of mine waste runoff in Cache Creek and other downstream bodies of water. Northern Coast Ranges The Northern Coast Ranges are a section of the California Coast Ranges. They run parallel to the Pacific Coast from the North San Francisco Bay Area to coastal Del Norte County. The Klamath Mountains, including the Siskiyou Mountains sub-range, lie to the north and northeast. The Southern Coast Ranges lie to the south. King Range meets the sea on the Lost Coast. =Geography= The Northern Coast Ranges run north- south parallel to the coast. Component ranges within the Northern Coast Ranges include the Mendocino Range of western Mendocino County and the Mayacamas, Sonoma, and Vaca Mountains and the Marin Hills of the North Bay. They also include the King Range, which meet the sea in the \\"Lost Coast\\" region. The southernmost peak of the Northern Coast Ranges is Mount Tamalpais. The highest point in the Northern Coast Ranges is Mount Linn, at 8,098 ft. (2,468 m). =Outer and Inner ranges= The Northern Coast Ranges consist of two main parallel belts of mountains, the Outer Northern Coast Ranges lying along the coast, and the Inner Northern Coast Ranges running inland to the east. They are separated by a long system of valleys. The northern valley portion is drained by the Eel River and its tributaries, and the southern by the Russian River. A series of short rivers, including the Mattole, Gualala, and Navarro rivers, drain the western slopes of the ranges. The eastern slopes of the ranges drain into the Sacramento Valley. Clear Lake lies in the southeast portion of the range, and drains eastward via Cache Creek. U.S. Route 101 runs generally north-south in the valleys between the Outer and Inner Northern Coast Ranges. =Natural history= The seaward face of the coastal Outer Northern Coast Ranges is part of the Northern California coastal forests ecoregion, home to lush forests of Coast Redwood and Coast Douglas-fir. The inland and dryer Inner Northern Coast Ranges are part of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, home to a number of plant communities including: mixed evergreen forest; oak woodland; and Interior chaparral and woodland. A major specific plant community of the inner ranges is Mediterranean California Lower Montane Black Oak-Conifer Forest, which supports particularly high biodiversity within the California Coast Ranges, including the nominate California Black Oak. Columbian Black-tailed Deer are the most widespread large mammal, after humans, of the Northern Coast Ranges. The rivers in the ranges are home to several species of salmon. Southern Coast Ranges Monument Peak over Milpitas, California =Geography= The Southern Coast Ranges, of the California Coast Ranges in the Pacific Coast Ranges System, run north and south, parallel to the Pacific Coast in north- central through north-southern California. The Southern Coast Ranges begin on the San Francisco Peninsula and in the East San Francisco Bay Area, and run south into Santa Barbara County. The Transverse Ranges lie to the south. The San Joaquin Valley is on the east, and Pacific Ocean on the west. The Southern Coast Ranges include the Berkeley Hills, the Diablo Range, the Santa Cruz Mountains, the Gabilan Range, the Santa Lucia Range and Sierra de Salinas, the Temblor Range, and the Sierra Madre Mountains. As for the Northern Coast Ranges, there are Outer Southern Coast Ranges along the Pacific Ocean on the west, and Inner Southern Coast Ranges to the east, inland to the San Joaquin Valley. The central and southern San Francisco Bay and the Salinas Valley lie between them. The highest point of the Southern Coast Ranges is Junipero Serra Peak in the Santa Lucia Range, at . Other peaks include Mount Diablo at , and Mount Hamilton at . =Natural history= The Southern Coast Ranges have a predominantly Mediterranean climate, and are primarily within the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. However, the moister areas of the Santa Cruz Mountains lie within the Northern California coastal forests ecoregion, characterized by forests of Coast redwood. Isolated groves of Coast redwoods are also found in the Big Sur region of the Santa Lucia Range, making them the southernmost natural occurrences of the species. Some of the rarest forest habitat that occurs in the California Coast Ranges are the Maritime Coast Range Ponderosa Pine forests of the western Santa Cruz Mountains.Earth Metrics Inc. (1990) Environmental Impact Report for the Scotts Valley Redevelopment Area, State of California Clearinghouse Report 7888, Sacramento, California These isolated groves may include Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and knobcone pine. Notably, the highest slopes of the Santa Lucias contain small patches of Sierran Conifer forest, including Incense Cedar, and Ponderosa, Jeffrey, and Sugar Pines. Steep rocky slopes harbor the endemic Santa Lucia Fir, the rarest species of fir on earth. The California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion has a great range of plant communities in the Southern Coast Ranges, including mixed evergreen forests, oak woodland and savannas, grasslands, northern coastal scrub, and the Monterey Pine woodlands of the Monterey Peninsula and two other coastal enclaves of the Santa Lucia Range. The name \\"chaparral\\" comes from the Spanish word chaparro, applied to California scrub oaks and Coastal scrub oaks. Common tree species of oak woodlands include oaks, California bay, and buckeye. Riparian species of the coast ranges include sycamore, White alder, Willows, and Big-Leaf Maple. Columbian Black-tailed deer occupy the northern and more coastal portions of the Southern Coast Ranges, and California mule deer occupy inland and southernmost portions of the Southern Coast Ranges.

The Taiwanese government planned originally to end this policy in 2014, but abolishing conscription is quite controversial among Taiwanese society, and hence the government has not yet created a firm schedule for its abolition. Females from the outlying islands within the province of Fuchien, which are geographically closest to mainland China, were also required to serve in a civil defense role, although this requirement has been dropped since the lifting of martial law. Although the majority of all enlisted positions in the ROC Armed Forces have been and are currently filled by draftees, the government intends to gradually expand the number of volunteer soldiers with the eventual goal of forming an all volunteer military. However, even then there will be compulsory basic training for all males reaching 18. Recent years have also seen an increase in the service options open to draftees, including alternative service with the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), as well as specialized service options for draftees in specific professions. The draft process is set forth under the ROC Military Service Act under the auspices of the MOI's National Conscription Agency as well as by Article 20 of the ROC Constitution. (from internet archive) The ROC Defense Ministry had announced that should voluntary enlistment reach sufficient numbers, the compulsory service period for draftees will be shortened to 14 months in 2007. It will be further shortened to 12 months in 2009.Reduced to 1 year On March 10, 2009 Minister of Defence Chen Chao-min said by the end of 2014 Taiwan will have an all-volunteer military force. The process of removing conscription will begin in 2010 and by the end of 2014 an all volunteer force will replace the conscripts. Individuals who wish to join must have a minimum of high school education and those who do not volunteer for the military will be required to complete four months of military boot camp. In 2012, it was reported that from 2013 on, military draftees born after January 1, 1994 will only need to receive four months of military training and will no longer be required to serve one year of military service, and that the government was on track to replace all serving conscripts with volunteers by the end of 2014. However, this timetable was pushed back in 2013 to the end of 2016. Should this policy remain unchanged, although the ROC will have a purely volunteer professional force, every male will still be conscripted to receive four-month military training. Thus, after 2016, compulsory military service will still remain in practice in the ROC. The Military Service Act of the Republic of China was first enacted in 1933 (when the island of Taiwan, including the Pescadores, was not part of the ROC), with the latest amendment in 2011. The Enforcement Act for the Military Service Act was first enacted in 1947, when the government was fighting with the Communist Party of China across China. History Initially, the Republic of China Army adopted mandatory conscription for males in regions under its control in order to fight the Japanese. Mandatory conscription was introduced to Taiwan in 1951. By 1954, the majority of conscripts served two years. Naval, air force and special forces conscripts served three years. In 1981, all conscripts began serving two years. Ten years later, the conscription period was reduced to twenty-two months, and alternative military service became an option. Between 2004 and 2007, two months were cut from mandatory military service each year, until a total of one year remained in 2008. Service time for men born after 1994 was cut to four months in 2013. The last group of mandatory conscripts were discharged in December 2018. Eligibility In accordance with the Law, the male citizens of the Republic of China are obligated to take military service. A man aged 18 starts his military service day from January 1st of the proceeding year and be discharged on December 31st of the year at the age of 36, called the Male's Service Age. https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=F0040001 Service options The following compulsory service options are available as of January 2006: * Enlisted military service (Â£´ÂÖµÂΩπ): 12 months of active duty enlisted military service in one of the four branches of the ROC Armed Forces. * Alternative service (Êõø‰ª£ÂΩπ): 12 months and 15 days of public safety or community service related work under the MOI, usually in the police, fire department, public clinics, local government offices, or as teachers in rural areas. Various billets are available only to draftees with related qualifications. * National defense service (ÂúãÈò≤ÂΩπ): Available to draftees with advanced degrees, particularly in the sciences and engineering, who upon selection, receive 3 months of officer training culminating in a commission as an officer in the reserves, followed by four years of employment in a government or academic research institution such as the Academia Sinica or Industrial Technology Research Institute. According to the NCA, male citizens born after January 1st, 1994 will only have to serve 4 months in Enlisted Military Service or 6 months in Alternative Service. The 4 months of Enlisted Military Service could be further broken down into two sessions of 2 months boot camps. Draft process The military draft process occurs in four steps: # Military Registration Investigation: Interview conducted by the conscription sections of local government offices to determine the educational background of the draftee as well as any special skills (e.g. proficiency in a foreign language). Generally occurs upon a male ROC national's 19th birthday or periodically upon his establishment (or change) of residence in ROC administered territories while of draft age but not yet drafted. Education and other deferments may be granted at this point if the draftee is eligible. If the draftee is not eligible for a deferment, a physical examination is scheduled. The draftee may also apply for alternative or national defense service at this point. In the case of the latter, the draftee will be required to compete successfully at an officer selection board for the desired billet, after which he will continue directly on to officer training school following completion of the physical exam. # Physical Examination: Draftee undergoes a full physical examination at a hospital approved by the Department of Health. Physical fitness is classified on three levels, A, B, and C, with level A and B draftees considered physically fit for military service. # Drawing Lots: Draftees fit for military service then draw lots to determine if they will serve in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps (Military police officers are selected from Army draftees). The chances of drawing for each service are not equal with the Army generally being the most probable, the Navy intermediate, and the Air Force and Marines being the least probable. # Basic Training: After being assigned a service branch, the draftee is then assigned a date to begin basic training, after which the draftee will enter active duty.

Smith, 4 Wend. 9 (1829), is a case decided by the Court of Appeals of New York which is relevant to eminent domain law. The case held that: > People of a state are entitled to all rights which formerly belong to the > King, by his prerogative. In Lansing v. Smith, a statute of New York authorized the construction of a basin in the Hudson at Albany, and erections whereby the docks, etc., of the plaintiff were rendered inaccessible by vessels. Despite this harm, it was determined that the act, although it provided no compensation for such injury, was not unconstitutional, either as taking private property for public use without compensation or as impairing the obligation of contracts; that the plaintiff had not at common law, as owner of the adjacent soil, nor by virtue of a grant from the State for land under water opposite to the shore, and under which he claimed, a right 'to the natural flow of the river with which the State had no right to interfere by any erection in the bed of the river or in any other manner.' The United States Supreme Court, in the later case of Shively v.

Geography The geography of the Huntsville-Decatur Metro Area ranges from the tall peaks of the southern Appalachian Mountains, to the low valleys formed by the Tennessee River. Decatur sits on the southern shore of the Tennessee River, while Huntsville lies about 10 miles from the Tennessee River, and sits at the base of Monte Sano Mountain. * Tennessee Valley * Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge * Monte Sano State Park * Joe Wheeler State Park Infrastructure =Roadways= The heart of the Huntsville‚ÄìDecatur Metro Area (Huntsville, Decatur, and Madison) is linked together by the 22 mile strip of Interstate 565. Interstate 565 begins at the very edge of the Decatur City Limits at a major interchange with Interstate 65. At the interchange, Alternate US 72 and State Route 20 turn into a controlled access highway taking up the name Interstate 565 as it passes under Interstate 65 receiving traffic from the north ‚Äì (Nashville), and south ‚Äì (Birmingham / Decatur / Hartselle) on top of the nearly 40,000-51,000 vehicles per day driving from Decatur to Huntsville on the Alternate US 72 Corridor. Plans are underway to extend Interstate 565 from the Interstate 65/Alternate US 72/State Route 20 interchange to the US 31/State Route 20/Alternate US 72 interchange in Decatur's Limestone County limits. Eventually the extended Interstate Highway will cross the Tennessee River's Wheeler Lake connecting with the proposed Memphis to Atlanta Highway. Huntsville/Madison roadways As Interstate 565 exits the northern portion of the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, Madison Boulevard (formerly State Route 20) branches off of the interstate leading into Madison. After Madison Boulevard converges with Interstate 565 nine miles down the road, Research Park Boulevard, an important north/south expressway serving Cummings Research Park, MidCity (a mixed used development at the location of the former Madison Square MallMadison Square Mall), and Redstone Arsenal, bypasses the northern section of Huntsville's busier Memorial Parkway. I-565 passing by the U.S. Space & Rocket Center Interstate 565 winds past the US Space and Rocket Center. As it approaches downtown, the interstate becomes elevated. About a after the elevated portion of the interstate begins is the largest interchange in Huntsville. The I-565/Memorial Parkway interchange carries over 150,000 vehicles a day. Memorial Parkway stretches from the Tennessee River to Normal. The Parkway feeds the 7-lane University Drive, also known as US 72. Also intersecting the Parkway is the 5-lane Governors Drive (US 431) that serves southeast Huntsville, Hampton Cove, and Huntsville Hospital.Huntsville Hospital Interstate 565 ascends Chapman Mountain, and descends the other side towards Gurley as US 72. Decatur roadways Decatur's main roadways are 6th Avenue ‚Äì (U.S. Route 31), and Beltline Road ‚Äì State Route 67. 6th Avenue, part of U.S. Route 31, begins as both State Route 20/Alternate US 72, and US 31 are carved out of the \\"Steamboat Bill\\" Hudson Memorial Bridge that crosses the Tennessee River at the north central part of town. AL 20/Alt US 72 continues west towards The Shoals, after The Beltline begins in the vicinity of the Solutia plant. After the Tennessee River bridges 6th Avenue continues southward where it eventually intersects with The Beltline. After that intersection, 6th Avenue continues southward now under the name of Decatur Highway towards Hartselle and Birmingham. The Beltline was built as a western bypass to cure 6th Avenue of its congestion problem. The area around the Beltline experienced rapid growth, causing even worse traffic problems. The city's approach to this was to widen the road to six lanes, which was to be completed by 2010. Economy The economy of the Huntsville-Decatur Area is made up mostly of Technical, Aerospace, Manufacturing, and Defensive jobs, and companies. Huntsville is also home to the second largest research park in the country, Cummings Research Park. The Huntsville‚ÄìDecatur Metro Area is the second fastest growing region/metro area in the state of Alabama because of the ample job opportunities being instilled in the area. Both ports in the metro area are two of the busiest in the state. Huntsville International Airport is the second busiest in Alabama, and still growing, trailing Birmingham International Airport in Birmingham. The Port of Decatur, along the Tennessee River, has grown to be the largest/busiest along the Tennessee River. =Tennessee Valley Authority= The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal plan, creating numerous dams, locks, nuclear power plants, coal power plants, along with many others, to create jobs along one of the most poverty ridden regions in the United States. The TVA has turned many tired North Alabama towns into some of the most technologically advanced cities in the country. A high quality of living, has helped to fuel the Huntsville and Decatur area's explosion into the aerospace, bio-technical, and other research market areas of the U.S. The Tennessee Valley Authority has grown to be the largest public utility provider in the United States.

The ferry was launched on June 11, 1986 and completed in October later that year. Northern Ranger entered service in 1986 with Marine Atlantic. Northern Ranger is named after her predecessor, SS Northern Ranger, launched in Scotland in 1936 and operated by the Newfoundland Railway and later Canadian National Railways for thirty years. In 1997, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador took over all intraprovincial ferry service from the federal crown corporation in exchange for a one-time payment for highway construction and capital costs toward improving the ferry service. Northern Ranger was transferred from federal ownership under Transport Canada to that of the Department of Transportation and Works. The vessel was then operated by Nunatsiavut Marine Inc. (NMI). The ferry offered weekly service from Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Rigolet, Makkovik, Postville, Hopedale, Natuashish and Nain with a return trip. On weekends, the vessel travels from Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Rigolet, Cartwright, Black Tickle and return. As of January 1, 2019, Northern Ranger was taken out of service and decommissioned.

His father was Jean Joseph Rolette, often referred to as Joe Rolette the elder, a French-Canadian and a trader himself. Joseph Rolette‚Äôs mother was Jane Fisher, who married Joe Rolette, Sr. in 1818 when she was either 13 or 14 years old. Jane's relatives took young Joseph to New York. Joseph's parents never divorced because they were Catholics, but the couple became separated in 1836. As part of the settlement, Joe Senior built what is today known as the Brisbois House for his estranged wife on Water Street, St. Feriole Island, Prairie du Chien, WI. As his sense of adventure developed, Joe Jr. headed back west in 1840 and by the time he was 21 he was working for his father's partners in the Red River valley area of Minnesota. Some of the best-known names in Minnesota history (Henry Hastings Sibley and Ramsey Crooks) were active and running a fur trading company in the area. While in their service Joseph Rolette rebuilt a trading post at Pembina. He was responsible for the building and the defense of the post as well as managing the business being conducted there. The area where the Pembina Trail crossed the Red Lake River is now Red Lake Falls, MN. In 1842 young Rolette put into a place a unique method of transportation. He created a line of carts that ran on the Red River Trails between Pembina and the head of Mississippi navigation at Mendota, Minnesota. As a result a substantial portion of the trade enjoyed by the Hudson's Bay Company in Canada was diverted to the United States. Rolette ran this concern with his mother's brother. By this time the trading post had grown and a Canadian native, Norman W. Kittson, was managing it. Kittson adopted the system of Red River ox carts, growing and adding more lines until it consisted of several thousand vehicles. During the late 1840s Rolette also had a hand in defending the posts, both from commercial rivals and unfriendly Native Americans. At one point he burned down a rival post which was trading whisky for furs, a transaction that was illegal during that time. In 1845 he married Angelique Jerome. Together they had eleven children. In 1851 he was elected to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature and served four terms. It was from his time in the legislature that the best-known story about him originates. A bill making St. Peter the capital of Minnesota was about to be enacted and, as he was chairman of the enrollment committee, bills of this nature had to pass through him. Rolette took physical possession of the document and disappeared for the rest of the session, not returning until it was too late to pass any more bills. St. Peter did not become the capital and it ended up in St. Paul where it remains today. According to the story, he spent the week away from the legislature drinking and playing poker in a hotel room with some friends. According to other versions of the story, the \\"hotel room\\" was actually a brothel. From 1857 to 1858, he served in the first Minnesota State Constitutional Convention and the Minnesota State Senate. During the Civil War he was unable to get a commission in the Union army and by the end of the war had lost much of his fortune. His health declined and he died on May 16, 1871.

A. \\"Judge\\" Wells (1924 - September 12, 2005), a Texas Southern University graduate, was the epitome of the American Football League's enlightened policies towards recruiting black athletes. Wells, while he was a sports photographer, accomplished the desegregation of fan seating at amateur and professional events in Houston, and was an advocate for civil rights and for black athletes throughout his life. As a part-time scout for the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs, he convinced Grambling defensive tackle Buck Buchanan to sign with the Chiefs in 1963. He also recruited defensive backs Jim Kearney and Emmitt Thomas, and linebacker Willie Lanier. Buchanan, Thomas and Lanier are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. After becoming pro football's first black full-time scout, in a famous \\"babysitting\\" incident in 1965, he managed to get wide receiver Otis Taylor (Prairie View A&M;) away from the NFL's Dallas team. Wells' success was a catalyst for the older league to try to get up to speed in signing talented black players from small colleges, including Historically black colleges and universities as the AFL had done from its inception. Contrary to the popular misconception fostered by the NFL, most of these stellar draft signings did not come after the \\"Common Draft\\" instituted with the AFL-NFL merger, but well before that time, in open competition with the NFL. No less than eight of Wells' recruits made All-AFL during their pro careers. He had a major hand in staffing the Chiefs to enable them to win the fourth and last World Championship Game between the champions of the AFL and the NFL, in which they defeated the Vikings 23-7.

Liu Yin was Liu Yao's son by his probable first wife, Princess Bu, while he was still the Prince of Qin. He had an older brother, Liu Jian (ÂäâÂÑâ). When Liu Jian was nine and Liu Yin was four, the emperor Liu Cong saw them, and was very impressed by Liu Yin. He told Liu Yao to make Liu Yin his heir. Liu Yao responded that he was just an imperial prince and should not reverse the proper order of heirship. Liu Cong instead told him that due to his contributions to Han Zhao, he was unlike other princes, and that he should make Liu Yin, whom he felt was more talented, the heir. He therefore created Liu Jian the Prince of Linhai and created Liu Yin as the heir to Liu Yao. As Liu Yin grew up, he became strong and skillful at horsemanship and archery, and was so quick in his reaction that he was compared to a whirlwind. When Liu Cong's successor Liu Can was overthrown by Jin Zhun in 318, Jin massacred members of the Liu clan in the capital Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). Liu Yin's grandmother Lady Hu and his uncle lost their lives, but Liu Yin fled. However, he was captured by or sold to the Heiniyuju (ÈªëÂåøÈÉÅÈû†) tribe as a slave. After Liu Yao defeated the renegade general Chen An (Èô≥ÂÆâ) in 323, Liu Yin revealed his identity to the chief, who was surprised and respectfully deliver Liu Yin back to Liu Yao. (It is not clear where Heiniyuju was or why Liu Yin waited until Chen's defeat to reveal his identity to the chief; it could have been that Heiniyuju was initially a Chen ally, and while Chen was, prior to his rebellion, nominally a Han Zhao general, Liu Yin might have been concerned about being detained by Chen as a bargaining chip.) By this time, Liu Yao, who had assumed that Liu Yin was dead, had created his younger son Liu Xi crown prince. He considered replacing Liu Xi with Liu Yin, since Liu Yin was the original heir, and he considered Liu Yin general material. However, after opposition by Liu Yin's uncle Bu Tai (ÂçúÊ≥∞) and another official Han Guang (ÈüìÂª£), Liu Yin personally declined to replace Liu Xi, instead stating that he could use his abilities to assist Liu Xi. Liu Yao agreed, and he let Liu Xi remain crown prince, while granting Liu Yin special honors, including requiring Liu Xi to yield to Liu Yin as an older brother in ceremonies, rather than for Liu Yin to yield to Liu Xi as the crown prince. The relationship between the brothers appeared to remain cordial until their deaths. He also posthumously honored Liu Yin's mother, Princess Bu, as Empress Yuandao. In 325, Liu Yao created Liu Yin the Prince of Nanyang and further bestowed the title of Grand Chanyu, putting Wu Hu tribal forces under his command. In 327, believing that Han Zhao had been weakened by its defeat at Later Zhao's hands, Zhang Jun, the head of Former Liang, which had submitted to Han Zhao's suzerainty in 323, declared himself again a Jin vassal and pillaged Han Zhao's Qin Province (Áß¶Â∑û, modern eastern Gansu). Liu Yin led an army and defeated Former Liang's forces, even crossing the Yellow River, but eventually settling for capturing Former Liang's remaining territory east of the Yellow River. Around the new year of 329, Liu Yao was captured in battle by Later Zhao forces. Liu Xi became effectively acting emperor, and after consulting with Liu Yin, he decided to withdraw from the capital Chang'an west to Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), the capital of the mountainous Qin Province, considered more easily defensible. However, the withdrawal caused a panic, and all Han Zhao generals abandoned their positions and fled to Qin Province as well, easily yielding most of remaining Han Zhao territory to Later Zhao. In fall 329, Han Zhao forces, under Liu Yin's command, tried to recapture Chang'an. Initially, he had some successes and recaptured much of the territory lost to Later Zhao. However, as he sieged Chang'an, the Later Zhao general Shi Hu arrived and defeated him. Liu Yin retreated toward Shanggui, and Shi Hu trailed him and defeated him again, capturing Shanggui. He killed Liu Xi, Liu Yin, along with all Han Zhao princes and high level officials and generals. He forcibly relocated all other officials and the large clans of Qin and Yong (ÈõçÂ∑û, modern central and northern Shaanxi) Provinces to the Later Zhao capital Xiangguo (Ë•ÑÂúã, in modern Xintai, Hebei), and massacred, in Luoyang, the members of the Xiongnu nobility. Han Zhao came to an end.

EF-1 side-view drawing. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) classes EP-1 and EF-1 comprised 42 boxcab electric locomotives built by the American Locomotive Company (Alco) in 1915. Electrical components were from General Electric. The locomotives were composed of two half-units semi-permanently coupled back-to-back, and numbered as one unit with 'A' and 'B' suffixes. As built, 30 locomotives were assigned to freight service, classified as EF-1 and numbered 10200‚Äì10229. The remaining twelve locomotives were assigned to passenger service as class EP-1, numbered 10100‚Äì10111, with higher-speed passenger gearing. The design was highly successful, replacing a much larger number of steam locomotives, cutting costs and improving schedules. General Electric self-proclaimed this electric locomotive to be the ‚ÄúKing of the Rails‚Äù in a silent promotional film from 1915. In 1919, with the arrival of a newer generation of passenger power, the EP-1 locomotives were converted to EF-1 freight locomotives, and renumbered 10230‚Äì10241. In this role, they served until the 1950s, when the arrival of the Little Joe locomotives began to replace them in freight service.  Technical information  They were fitted with multiple-unit train control systems, and could thus be joined together into larger sets and operated from a single control station. They were also retrofitted with a special multiple unit control system designed by an electrical engineer of The Milwaukee Road. This enabled the crew of a boxcab to control trailing diesel electric locomotives. However, the EF-4 \\"Little Joes\\", which were also retrofitted, were more often seen leading diesel electrics than boxcabs, which had by then been largely relegated to the role of helper or bank engine. The maximum speed of an EF-1 as built was . Higher speeds led to excessive strain on the traction motor armatures. The rebuilding programme of the 1950s raised this to to help maintain faster schedules. The two powered trucks were connected together with a ball-and-socket joint, and the couplers were also attached to the trucks. The bodywork, therefore, did not take the load of the train. Each truck had outside bar frames, allowing more room for the traction motors and equipment. The front powered truck's frames extended forward and carried an outrigger truck and the heavy snowplows the units bore. EF-2, EF-3, EF-5 and ES-3 In the 1930s, with train tonnage increasing, the Milwaukee began to create three-unit locomotives out of the boxcab units. A simple combination of three was classified EF-2. Twelve EF-2s were assembled, and renumbered 10500‚Äì10511ACB. On these, the cab on the center (C) unit was unnecessary and just added weight and length. The center units were therefore shortened by removing the cab, the pilot truck and the frame extension; these were nicknamed \\"bobtails\\". These were assembled in between two standard units to create EF-3 sets. These \\"bobtail\\" units weighed less than a regular unit. Additional EF-2s were created, but no more were modified into \\"bobtails\\". The locomotives were renumbered in 1939, the EF-3s being numbered E25‚ÄìE36, and the EF-1s E50‚ÄìE73. In 1951, five four-unit locomotives were created; these were classified EF-5 and could have any combination of regular or bobtail units in the center two positions. Their numbers gradually increased until 10 were in service in 1961. When an odd number of EF-2s were created, a single boxcab unit became surplus. This unit was classified as a heavy switcher and given class ES-3.  EP-1A  In 1953, two EF-1 locomotives, E69A/B and E28A/B were converted back into passenger service as class EP-1A to help the aging Bi- Polars on the Puget Sound Extension. The first to receive this treatment was E69, which became E22A/B. During the rebuilding process, they received steam generators, engine trucks from scrapped F7 Hudsons, and high speed gearing. E28 soon followed a few months later and emerged as E23A/B. E22A and E23A received some smoothing of their appearances, including somewhat \\"streamlined\\" cab fronts. They were later repainted into the Union Pacific Railroad scheme of Armour Yellow with Harbor Mist Gray roofs, and red dividing lines. After rebuilding, they could develop 4500 hp. These two locomotives served until March 1961 in this role; at which time, the E23A and E23B were renumbered E22D and E22C. The EP-1a's all became apart of EF-5 E22A/B/C/D until 1966 when E22C was wrecked and the 3 remaining units operated as A/B/D set. E22A/B/D was finally scrapped in 1973. Retirements The fleet stayed intact until 1951, when two EF-1s were retired ‚Äì E51A+B and E68A+B. Two units of an EF-2 were retired in 1954, and the remaining numbers held steady until the mid-1960s, when old age began to take its toll. Locomotives were patched-up until un- repairable, and units within were swapped between locomotives without being renumbered. Most were retired by the end of 1973, but one unit, E57B and its \\"bobtail\\" companion, were kept in service as the Harlowton, Montana switcher until June 1974. Today Unit E50A+B, originally 10200A+B, the first locomotive built, still survives and is preserved at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth, Minnesota. Unit E57B, originally 10211B, is now preserved at Harlowton, Montana. Both are on static display.

Photographer Lee Miller made her only film appearance in this movie, which features an appearance by the famed aerialist Barbette. It is the first part of The Orphic Trilogy, which is continued in Orph√©e (1950) and concludes with Testament of Orpheus (1960). Plot The Blood of a Poet is divided into four sections. In section one, an artist sketches a face and is startled when its mouth starts moving. He rubs out the mouth, only to discover that it has transferred to the palm of his hand. After experimenting with the hand for a while and falling asleep, the artist awakens and places the mouth over the mouth of a female statue. In section two, the statue speaks to the artist, cajoling him into passing through a mirror. The mirror transports the artist to a hotel, where he peers through several keyholes, witnessing such people as an opium smoker and a hermaphrodite. The artist is handed a gun and a disembodied voice instructs him how to shoot himself in the head. He shoots himself but does not die. The artist cries out that he has seen enough and returns through the mirror. He smashes the statue with a mallet. In section three, some students are having a snowball fight. An older boy throws a snowball at a younger boy, but the snowball turns out to be a chunk of marble. The young boy dies from the impact. In the final section, a card shark plays a game with a woman on a table set up over the body of the dead boy. A theatre party looks on. The card shark extracts an Ace of Hearts from the dead boy's breast pocket. The boy's guardian angel appears and absorbs the dead boy. He also removes the Ace of Hearts from the card shark's hand and retreats up a flight of stairs and through a door. Realizing he has lost, the card shark commits suicide as the theatre party applauds. A female player transforms into the formerly smashed statue and walks off through the snow, leaving no footprints. In the film's final moments the statue is shown with an ox, a globe, and a lyre. Intercut through the film, oneiric images appear, including spinning wire models of a human head and rotating double-sided masks.

It must be deciphered.\\" The film is considered, along with The Golden Age (1930), one of two French films released at the end of this first phase of avant-garde film-making that continue to develop the model presented by Chien Andalou: The film is a blend of Cocteau's classical aesthetics and the Baroque stylings of Surrealism. Cocteau's voice satirically explores his character's obsession with fame and death: \\"Those who smash statues should beware of becoming one\\". Dissolution of personal identity is presented in contrast with Western emphasis on stability and repetition. The Blood of a Poet was funded by Charles, Vicomte de Noailles, who gave Cocteau 1,000,000 francs to make it. Cocteau invited the Vicomte and his wife Marie-Laure de Noailles, along with several of their friends, to appear in a scene as a theatre party. In the scene, they talked among themselves and, on cue, began applauding. Upon seeing the completed film, they were horrified to learn that they were applauding a game of cards that ended with a suicide, which had been filmed separately. They refused to let Cocteau release the film with their scene included, so Cocteau re-shot it with the famed female impersonator Barbette and some extras.Francis Steegmuller, \\"An Angel, A Flower, A Bird\\", The New Yorker, September 27, 1969. The films is not considered to be anti-theocratic in the way of Luis Bu√±uel's L'Age d'Or, but the film's protagonist does explore such varied topics as magic, archaic art, China, opium and transvestism before dying while playing cards in front of an indifferent audience. Delayed release Shortly after the completion of the film, rumors began to circulate that it contained an anti-Christian message. This, combined with the riotous reception of another controversial Noailles-produced film, L'√¢ge d'or, led to Charles de Noailles' expulsion from the famous Jockey-Club de Paris, and he was even threatened with excommunication by the Catholic Church. The furore caused the release of The Blood of a Poet to be delayed for more than a year. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.66/10. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it \\"Imaginative, dreamlike, and still a visual delight.\\" References External links  *The Blood of a Poet an essay by Jean Cocteau at the Criterion Collection Category:1930 films Category:1930s fantasy films Category:French avant-garde and experimental films Category:Films directed by Jean Cocteau Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:Orpheus Category:Films scored by Georges Auric Category:Films with screenplays by Jean Cocteau Category:Surrealist films Category:French black- and-white films Category:French fantasy films ","title":"The Blood of a Poet"},{"id":"3644342","text":"Adi Asilina Davila Toganivalu is a Fijian academic and businesswoman.

Unlike their taller cousins, Mame Momoko dolls come in male and female, though there are no anatomical differences to speak of.  Ruruko Doll  In October 2013, PetWORKs debuted Ruruko as Momoko's little sister, a brand new line of dolls that introduced kids fashion for a smaller 20 cm (8 inch) body. Much like PetWORKs' current CCS line of Momoko dolls, each new release of Ruruko is made in very limited quantity and direct from the dollmakers themselves. Instead of a Sekiguchi body, Ruruko uses the smallest 1/6 scale doll body from Azone (:ja:„Ç¢„Çæ„É≥„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éº„Éä„Ç∑„Éß„Éä„É´), known as the Pure Neemo XS.

It is a type of screw whose spherical head is enclosed in a housing, which allows the screw a range of motion along several different axes relative to the housing. The ball joint allows the surgeon some flexibility in placing the screws. The screws are typically placed into the pedicle of the vertebra. It has also been hypothesized that polyaxial screws add a safety benefit by failing in the housing/screw interface before breaking in the shaft of the bone screw or in the orthopaedic rod. Unlike standard lateral mass plate and screw systems, the new cervical polyaxial screw and rod system easily accommodates severe degenerative cervical spondylosis and curvatures. This instrumentation system allows for polyaxial screw placement with subsequent multiplanar rod contouring and offset attachment.

Directed by and starring Jean Cocteau, who plays himself as an 18th-century poet, the film includes cameo appearances by Pablo Picasso, Jean Marais, Charles Aznavour, Jean-Pierre Leaud, and Yul Brynner. It is considered the final part of The Orphic Trilogy, following The Blood of a Poet (1930) and Orph√©e (1950). One critic described it as a \\"wry, self- conscious re-examination of a lifetime's obsessions\\" with Cocteau placing himself at the center of the mythological and fictional world he spun throughout his books, films, plays and paintings. The film includes numerous instances of \\"double takes\\", including one scene where Cocteau, walking past himself, looks back to see himself in what was described by one scholar as \\"a retrospective on the Cocteau ≈ìuvre\\". The New York Times called it \\"self- serving\\", noting that the pretension of the film was certainly intended by Cocteau as his last statement made on film: \\"as much a long-winded self- analysis as an extraordinary succession of visually arresting images\\".

Initially, he had been skeptical of the value that sound would bring, saying that it was \\"an unnatural creation, just useful for canned theater.\\" He detested the other sound films of the day and their dedication to the slavish dialogue. He would change his feelings when he realised that he could also apply a soundtrack to a film, a strategy he used in Le Million, three years after the first sound film was released. Release Le Million was released in France on 15 April 1931. Critical reception Paul Sherman of the Boston Herald described the film as \\"lively and down-to-earth\\". Jeremy Heilman of Movie Martyr says that the \\"sophisticated use of the fledgling (sound) technology led to universal acclaim for the director, who became regarded as the first true master of the sound film.\\" The eminent New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael lavished praise on the film: \\"Ren√© Clair at his exquisite best; no one else has ever been able to make a comedy move with such delicate, dreamlike inevitability ‚Ä¶ This movie is lyrical, choreographic, giddy--it's the best French musical of its period.\\" Elliot Stein of Criterion calls the film \\"a synthesis, a perfect fusion of sound, dialogue, camera placement and editing.

The story starts with a young singer, Florence \\"Cl√©o\\" Victoire, at 5pm on June 21, as she waits until 6:30pm to hear the results of a medical test that will possibly confirm a diagnosis of cancer. The film is known for its handling of several of the themes of existentialism, including discussions of mortality, the idea of despair, and leading a meaningful life. The film has a strong feminine viewpoint belonging to French feminism and raises questions about how women are perceived, especially in French society. Mirrors appear frequently to symbolize self-obsession, which Cl√©o embodies. The film includes cameos by Jean-Luc Godard, Anna Karina, Eddie Constantine and Jean-Claude Brialy as characters in the silent film Raoul shows Cl√©o and Doroth√©e, while composer Michel Legrand, who wrote the film's score, plays \\"Bob the pianist\\". It was entered into the 1962 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Cl√©o Victoire is having a tarot card reading with a fortune teller, who tells her that there is a widow in Cl√©o's life, who is completely devoted to her, but is also a terrible influence (her maid, Ang√®le). The fortune teller also sees that Cl√©o has recently met a generous young man, which she confirms, claiming that she doesn't see him too often, but he got her into the music industry. The fortune teller then says that she will meet a talkative young man. There is also an evil force in Cl√©o's life: a doctor. The fortune teller then pulls the hanged man card, meaning that Cl√©o is ill, potentially with cancer. She then proceeds to pull the death tarot card, and Cl√©o requests that the fortune teller read her palm. After examining her lifeline, the fortune teller remains silent before telling Cl√©o that she does not read hands, leading Cl√©o to believe that she is doomed. While distraught from her visit to the fortune teller, Cl√©o reminds herself \\"as long as I'm beautiful, I'm alive\\" and that death is ugly. She meets her maid, Ang√®le, at a caf√© and recounts the results of the tarot card reading, claiming that if it's cancer, she'll kill herself. Cl√©o cries in the caf√©, even though there are people around, including the owner of the caf√©. Cl√©o and Ang√®le proceed to go hat shopping, where Cl√©o only pays attention to the black fur hats, despite Ang√®le constantly reminding her that it's summertime. The black hats all beckon her, and she eventually picks out a black, winter hat. Cl√©o wants to wear the hat home, but Ang√®le reminds her that it's Tuesday, and it's bad luck to wear something new on a Tuesday. They have the shopkeeper send the hat to Cl√©o's home, and Cl√©o and Ang√®le take a taxi home in time for Cl√©o's rehearsal. The taxi driver is a woman, and Cleo and Angele find her to be an interesting character. On the ride home, one of Cl√©o's songs plays, and they listen to the radio, discussing current news including the Algerian War, rebels who have been recently arrested, the Vienna Conference, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and √âdith Piaf's recent surgery. Towards the end of the taxi ride, Cl√©o grows nauseous and attributes it to her illness. Upon returning home, Cl√©o cannot breathe, and Ang√®le tells her to do some exercise. Ang√®le helps her change into her clothes for rehearsal while Cl√©o is stretching out on a pull-up bar. She then lights a cigarette and relaxes in her bed. Before Cl√©o's lover, the man who the fortune teller mentioned earlier, enters the building, Ang√®le tells Cl√©o not to tell him that she's ill, because men \\"hate weakness\\". Her lover, a very busy man, tells her that he only has time to stop by for a kiss and that he'll be able to take her on vacation soon. Cl√©o tells him that she's ill, but he doesn't take her seriously. Cl√©o thinks that she's too good to men who are all egoists, to which Ang√®le agrees. Once Cl√©o's lover leaves, Bob, a pianist, and Maurice, a writer, arrive at her home for her rehearsal. Bob and Maurice pretend to be doctors once Ang√®le tells them that Cl√©o is ill, because \\"all women like a good joke.\\" However, Cl√©o does not find their joke funny, as no one is taking her illness seriously but her. Bob goes to the piano, and they begin to practice some of Cl√©o's songs. As they practice, Cl√©o's mood quickly darkens after singing the song \\"Sans Toi.\\" Cl√©o feels like all people do is exploit her and that it won't be long until she's just a puppet for the music industry. Saying that everyone spoils her but no one loves her, Cl√©o leaves everyone behind in her home. On the way to a caf√©, Cl√©o passes a street performer swallowing frogs and spitting them back out on a huge wave of water. She plays one of her songs at a jukebox in the caf√© and is upset when no one seems to notice the music playing in the background. Instead of remaining at the caf√©, Cl√©o goes to a sculpting studio to visit her old friend, Doroth√©e, who is modelling nude for an artist. Once she's finished, Doroth√©e claims that her body makes her happy, not proud, and Doroth√©e drives Cl√©o to her home. Cl√©o tells her friend that she is dying of cancer. Doroth√©e returns the car to her lover, a projectionist, and they watch a silent movie from the projection booth, which jokingly shows a woman dying. Leaving the cinema, Cl√©o accidentally breaks a mirror, which she claims is a bad omen. Cl√©o and Doroth√©e then take a taxi, and pass a crime scene where a man was killed. Doroth√©e tells her that the broken mirror was meant for that man, not Cl√©o. Having dropped Doroth√©e off at her apartment, Cl√©o has the taxi driver take her to Parc Montsouris. By a bridge on a river, Cl√©o meets Antoine, a soldier on leave from the Algerian War. Antoine helps Cl√©o realize her selfishness, and asks her to accompany him to the train station to return to the war if he accompanies her to the hospital to get her test results. Before leaving, Antoine confides in Cl√©o about his thoughts on the war, and that in Algeria, they die for nothing, and that scares him. He also tells Cl√©o that girls always seem to be afraid to give themselves completely to someone and that they're afraid of losing something close to them, so they love by halves. Cl√©o realizes that that describes her perfectly. Antoine and Cl√©o go to the hospital by bus, and the doctor who tested Cl√©o for her possible cancer isn't in, despite the fact that he told her he'd be present at 7 pm that day. Cl√©o and Antoine sit on a bench outside, as Cl√©o is still determined that the doctor will be there. While Cl√©o has come to terms with her illness and is able to face the test results with courage thanks to Antoine's help, the doctor rolls by in his car and tells Cl√©o that she has cancer and will need to undergo two months of radiation therapy. Cl√©o says that her fear seems to be gone, and she seems happy, while Antoine starts crying. She tells him that they have plenty of time together before he leaves to go back to Algeria as a soldier. For the first time in at least two hours, Cl√©o seems to be happy as she looks at Antoine.

The war greatly affected France during the 1950s and 1960s, where the demands for decolonization were the strongest. The soldier who Cl√©o meets towards the end of the film, Antoine, is on temporary leave from fighting in Algeria. Antoine also builds on the theme of existentialism that the film conveys, with his claims that the people in Algeria are dying for nothing. There are also protests on the street that Cl√©o encounters while taking a taxi back to her home. Cl√©o from 5 to 7 embodies the stereotypes that men subject women to and their oppressiveness. Cl√©o commonly complains that no one takes her seriously since she's a woman, and that the men think that she's faking her illness for attention. She seems to go along with these stereotypes as well, as many women in France did, telling herself essentially that beauty is everything by saying \\"as long as I'm beautiful, I'm alive.\\" Beginning in the 1940s, the French intellectual scene was dominated by existentialism, a movement in philosophy that would greatly influence art in France well into the 1960s. Cl√©o from 5 to 7 is largely an existential film, as for the entirety of the film, Cl√©o struggles with her existence and the potential of facing her mortality. The impending results of her medical exam and the mere possibility that she may be diagnosed with cancer leaves Cl√©o open to an existential mind where she is aware of her own mortality. Further, upon meeting Antoine, the soldier talks about the deaths of the Algerian War, and that they are dying for nothing and without a purpose, further appealing to the existential philosophy.

He was one of the early generation of composers to carry the Franco-Flemish polyphonic style from its home region in the Netherlands to Italy. He was probably born in Pulle, near Antwerp, but nothing is known about his life until he became zangmeester (singing master) at the church of Our Lady in Antwerp in 1443. He unsuccessfully auditioned with Philip the Good for the Burgundian court chapel, but was not accepted for a position; he then in 1447 went to Rome, where he sang in the papal chapel until 1468. He returned to Antwerp, becoming residential canon at the same church at which he had worked in the 1440s, and he died there in 1478. During his career he was a colleague of both Johannes Philibert and the renowned Johannes Ockeghem. Music and influence One complete cyclic mass has survived, a Missa sine nomine, for three voices; most likely dating from the 1450s, it is one of the earliest cyclic masses to be written on the continent. It shows such influence of English music that it has been mistaken for the work of an anonymous English composer. The mass displays a complex transmission pattern, which has confused its dating and provenance. Pullois also wrote a motet for the Christmas season Flos de spina, which is similar stylistically to works by Ockeghem, and may have been written during his time in Italy. One other motet, Victime paschali laudes, and three sacred contrafacta of secular songs have survived. He also wrote 14 secular songs (including the three with contrafactum texts) which appear in various sources from Italy as well as Germany.

Early life John Barker was born on 19 February 1975. Barker played junior football for Pascoe Vale in the Essendon District Football League. Here Barker played in the 1991 Under 16 premiership winning team. In 1992 Barker played for the Northern Knights in the first season of the VSFL under 18 competition. Barker also represented Vic Metro (Metropolitan Victoria) in the Teal Cup and was named at centre half forward for the Victorian Under 18 All-Star team. Barkers' form at Under 18 level attracted plenty of interest from AFL club scouts. In the 1992 AFL Draft John Barker was selected at pick 25 by the Fitzroy Football Club. AFL playing career =Fitzroy= Barker did not play a senior game for Fitzroy in 1993 and missed most of the season due to back and hamstring injuries. Barker's first senior game in the AFL was in round 2 of the 1994 season against Essendon at Princes Park. Barker played 47 games and kicked 12 goals at Fitzroy over his 3 seasons at the club. During the 1994 AFL season Barker's talent was noticed and as a result he picked up an AFL Rising Star award nomination. When Fitzroy merged with the Brisbane Bears at the end of 1996, and Brisbane changed their name to become Brisbane Lions. Barker was just one of seven Fitzroy players to join the newly formed team. =Brisbane= In Barker's only year at the Brisbane Lions, the 1997 season, he managed just 8 games and only 1 goal. At the end of the season Barker and teammate Nathan Chapman were traded to Hawthorn in exchange for Brad Scott. =Hawthorn= After two seasons at Hawthorn Barker's AFL career looked over, but in round 3 of the 2000 AFL season, John Barker made his mark as an AFL footballer. Barker kicked 4 goals and took some clean one-grab marks to help the hawks come from behind to beat the Brisbane Lions in a thriler (Hawthorn 16 14 110 def. Brisbane Lions 15 13 103). Barker's time at Hawthorn saw him become the key option up forward during the 2000, '01 and '02 seasons. John Barker may best be remembered for his remarkable two goals during the 2001 semi final against Port Adelaide. One from Football Parks \\"dead pocket\\" which put the hawks within four points. Then the next with only two minutes remaining, the goal which will long live in the minds of Hawks fans for years to come. Barker was a key part of the Hawks' 2001 season which saw them make their way to a preliminary final. Barker won the club's goal kicking award in 2001 with 47 goals and was equal 3rd in the Best and Fairest. From mid-2002 Barker suffered numerous injuries and struggled to get back to top form. From this point he played most of his football recovering from injuries and proving his fitness with the Box Hill Hawks(Hawthorn Reserves) in an attempt to play at senior level again. 2006 would be John Barkers final year as an AFL footballer and he could just manage 7 games due to on-going shoulder and hamstring injuries. In the week leading up to round 20 of the '06 season Barker announced his retirement, saying his body could no longer stand up to AFL football. In the lead up to the final game of the season several Hawthorn players offered to give up their spot in the side to see that Barker could play a farewell game. Barker kicked 1 goal in the 61 point win against Geelong. AFL coaching career After Barker announced his retirement, Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson said the club was keen to retain Barker for 2007, possibly in a coaching role. Just weeks later Barker was appointed as the forward line coach for the St Kilda Football Club under a two-year deal. St. Kilda coach Ross Lyon and Barker had played together at Fitzroy and Lyon believed Barker had a lot to offer as a coach. After two years at St. Kilda, Barker was offered a coaching role at Hawthorn and jumped at the chance to return to club he called home for nine years as a player. Barker was the forward line coach for 2009 and 2010. Barker has been an assistant coach at Carlton since the 2011 season.John Barker Joins Carlton , carltonfc.com.au, 14 Oct 2010. Retrieved 9 Sep 2012. On 26 May 2015, following the mid-season sacking of Mick Malthouse as head coach of Carlton, Barker was appointed interim senior coach until the end of the season. He coached the club to three wins from the final fourteen matches, and was one of the front-runners for the senior coaching role before it eventually went to Brendon Bolton. Barker remains at the club today as their stoppages coach.

The cyclic mass was the first multi- movement form in western music to be subject to a single organizing principle. The period of composition of cyclic masses was from about 1430 until around 1600, although some composers, especially in conservative musical centers, wrote them after that date. Types of cyclic masses include the \\"motto\\" mass (or \\"head-motif\\" mass), cantus-firmus mass, paraphrase mass, parody mass, as well as masses based on combinations of these techniques. History Prior to complete settings of the Mass Ordinary by a single composer, which had become the norm by around the middle of the 15th century, composers often set pairs of movements. Gloria-Credo pairs, as well as Sanctus-Agnus Dei pairs, are found in many manuscripts of the early 15th century, by composers such as Johannes Ciconia, Arnold de Lantins and Zacara da Teramo. While it is possible that some of these composers wrote an entire setting of the mass, no complete cyclic setting by a single composer has survived. (The Messe de Nostre Dame by Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300‚Äì1377), which dates to before 1365 is generally not considered to be a true cyclic mass, but is the earliest surviving complete mass setting by a single composer, although the existence of at least four earlier such pieces is known.) Some mass cycles from the period 1420‚Äì1435, especially from northern Italy, show that composers were working in the direction of a unified mass, but were solving the problem in a different way: often a separate tenor would be used for each movement of a mass that was otherwise unified stylistically.Gomez, \\"Mass,\\" Grove. The true cyclic mass most likely originated in England, and the first composers known to have organized a mass by using the same cantus firmus in each movement were John Dunstable and Leonel Power. However it was the Missa Caput, an anonymous English composition once attributed to Guillaume Dufay, \\"one of the most revered compositions of the 15th century\\",Kirkman, \\"Caput\\", Grove. which was to be the most influential on continental practice; this work appears in seven separate continental sources of the 15th century, more than any other mass prior to the 1480s.Kirkman, \\"Caput\\", Grove. Among other features, it was the first widely influential work to use a freely-written bass line underneath the tenor cantus firmus. As a result of the spread of the Missa Caput, composers commonly added this lower voice to their polyphonic textures after about mid- century; this allowed a harmonic and cadential flexibility which was previously lacking.Robertson, p. 537-8. The earliest consistently-used method for organizing the movements of the mass was use of a head motif, also known as a \\"motto\\". In this case, a recognizable theme or thematic fragment began each of the important sections of the mass. Many \\"motto\\" masses were also unified by some other means, but such a procedure was not necessary. An early example of a \\"motto\\" mass is the Missa verbum incarnatum by Arnold de Lantins, probably from around 1430, in which each movement is linked by use of a head motif. Additionally, the movements contain subtle references to his own motet O pulcherrima mulierum. Many of Dufay's masses use the head-motif technique, even when they employ another, such as cantus-firmus. The motto technique was common on the continent, but rare with English composers.Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 473. During the late 15th century, cantus firmus technique was by far the most frequent method used to unify cyclic masses. The cantus firmus, which at first was drawn from Gregorian chant, but later from other sources such as secular chansons, was usually set in longer notes in the tenor voice (the next-to-lowest).Lockwood, Grove The other voices could be used in many ways, ranging from freely composed polyphony to strict canon, but the texture was predominantly polyphonic but non-imitative. In some cases the cantus firmus appeared also in voices other than then tenor, with increasing freedom as the century reached its close. Secular chansons became the favored source for cantus firmi by the time of Ockeghem and his generation (the last third of the 15th century), and composers began writing their own; for example Ockeghem's Missa au travail suis is based on his own chanson of that name. Ockeghem was a particularly experimental composer, writing probably the first example of a mass organized entirely by canon: the Missa prolationum. Instead of being based on a fixed cantus firmus, each movement is a mensuration canon, with the interval of imitation expanding from the unison to the octave during the course of the mass (Leeman Perkins called this \\"the most extraordinary contrapuntal achievement of the 15th century\\", and compared it in scope and execution with the Goldberg Variations of J.S. Bach).Perkins, \\"Ockeghem\\", Grove Another of Ockeghem's masses, the Missa cuiusvis toni, is so written that it can be performed in any of the four modes. By the beginning of the 16th century, the cantus firmus technique was no longer the preferred method for composition of masses, except in some areas distant from Rome and the Low Countries (Spanish composers, in particular, used the method into the 16th century). Some other methods of organizing cyclic masses include paraphrase and parody. In paraphrase technique, a source tune, which could be either sacred or secular, is elaborated, usually by ornamentation but occasionally by compression. Usually in paraphrase masses the tune appears in any voice. Josquin des Prez' Missa Pange lingua (c. 1520) is a famous example; Palestrina also used the method extensively, second only to parody technique. The parody mass, also known as the imitation mass (for the use of the word \\"parody\\" implies no satire, but is based on a misreading of a 16th-century source), uses many voices from a polyphonic source to unify the different movements of a cyclic mass. Parody technique was the most commonly used of all the methods in the 16th century: Palestrina alone wrote 51 parody masses. Either sacred or secular source material could be used in constructing a parody mass, and some of the songs were secular indeed: a late example was Orlande de Lassus' Missa entre vous filles (1581), based on an obscene popular song by Clemens non Papa, \\"Entre vous filles de quinze ans\\" (\\"You sweet 15-year-old girls\\").Haar, \\"Orlande de Lassus\\", Grove See also * Cyclic form * Cantus firmus mass Notes References * J.

She was designed to be as large as possible without counting against the Washington Treaty limits. During the Spanish Civil War, she protected neutral merchant shipping and played a limited role during World War II as she spent the early part of the war in North African waters or acting as an aviation transport between France and North Africa. She was slightly damaged during the British bombardment of the French Fleet at Mers- el-K√©bir in July 1940. Commandant Teste was scuttled at Toulon when the Germans invaded Vichy France in November 1942, but was refloated after the war and considered for conversion to an escort or training carrier. Neither proposal was accepted and she was sold for scrap in 1950. Design After the completion of aircraft carrier , the Marine Nationale desired another aviation vessel, but the lack of another hull that could cheaply be converted made another aircraft carrier too expensive. It settled for a seaplane carrier () that could act as a mobile aviation base and support seaplanes for a specific attack. The ship was restricted to a maximum size of at standard displacement, which prevented her from counting against France's Washington Treaty capital ship allocation (she could not have been counted as an aircraft carrier, because she did not meet the Washington Treaty requirement for aircraft to be able to launch from the ship and land back on). This also served to keep her costs relatively low.Jordan, p. 26 Description Commandant Teste was long overall. She had a maximum beam of and a draught of . She displaced at standard load, at normal load and at full load.Jordan, p. 29 Because of the ship's high profile, there were concerns about her stability in bad weather as she had a significant amount of weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37‚Äì65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.Jordan, pp. 32‚Äì33 =Propulsion= Commandant Teste had a two-shaft Unit system of machineryunit machinery layout with alternating boiler and engine rooms. Her Schneider-Zoelly geared steam turbines were designed for . Four superheated Loire-Yarrow small-tube boilers powered the turbines at a pressure of at a temperature of . These were the first superheated boilers in the Marine National and required some modifications after the ship's trials.Jordan, pp. 31‚Äì32 The two in the forward boiler room were oil-fired, but the other two could use either fuel oil or coal. Commandant Teste had a designed speed of , but she exceeded during sea trials on 23 July 1933. of fuel oil was carried as well as of coal. This provided a range of at or at using only coal. Two 300 kilowatt (kW) turbo generators provided electricity at 235 volts. Three 150 kW diesel generators were fitted to provide power while in harbor.Jordan, pp. 29‚Äì32 =Armament= Commandant Teste was originally going to carry a mixture of or anti-surface and anti-aircraft (AA) guns, but this was changed before construction began to a homogeneous main battery of twelve Canon de Mod√®le 1927 45-caliber dual- purpose guns on powered single mounts. Five guns each were mounted on the fore and aft superstructures and two were mounted between the catapults.Jordan, p. 34 Their elevation limits were ‚àí10¬∞ to +85¬∞. Their rate of fire was 10 rounds per minute. They had a maximum range of about with a armor-piercing shell at a muzzle velocity of . 280 rounds were provided for each gun, including 40 star shell rounds and 19 tracer rounds. Eight /50 cal semi-automatic AA guns were carried by Commandant Teste. Two each were fitted on the fore and aft superstructures and four on platforms around the single funnel. 4,000 rounds were carried; 500 rounds per gun. The guns could depress 15¬∞ and elevate to 80¬∞. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Their effective anti-aircraft ceiling was less than . Six twin Hotchkiss Mitrailleuse de Mod√®le 1929 machine gun mounts were also fitted, two mounts were positioned on the bridge wings, two on the upper funnel platform, and two on the stern. The Hotchkiss guns had a cyclic rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 200 and 250 rounds per minute to allow for reloading its 30-round magazines. They had a theoretical ceiling of . Two fire-control directors were mounted to control the 100 mm guns; one above the bridge and the other atop the rear superstructure. Each director was fitted with a stereoscopic rangefinder. An upgrade to rangefinders was planned to improve the director's performance against surface targets, but was never carried out. The midships 37 mm anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a single rangefinder, but nothing was provided for the fore and aft 37 mm guns. =Protection= Commandant Teste had a waterline armor belt with a maximum thickness of abreast the machinery spaces and was high. The ship was protected from axial fire at the waterline by partial transverse bulkheads thick. The magazines were protected by 5 cm sides and 2 cm ends and roofs. The deck consisted of two layers of plating which increased to three layers above the boilers. of armor protected the steering gear. The sides of the conning tower were thick, but its roof was thick.Jordan, pp. 29, 32 =Aircraft arrangements= Commandant Teste had a very large hangar amidships that was three decks high and measured approximately . It was partitioned in two by a bulkhead that incorporated the exhaust uptakes for the funnel and the ventilation trunking for the machinery spaces. It could accommodate ten large torpedo bombers with folding wings; two smaller aircraft with folding wings could be stowed in lieu of each torpedo bomber. Two additional large aircraft and four smaller aircraft could be carried dismantled in crates in a hold below the hangar.Jordan, pp. 29‚Äì30 The aircraft were moved on a system of wheeled trolleys running on D√©cauville rails that extended throughout each half-hangar to the quarterdeck at the rear of the ship. The torpedo bombers would be moved to the quarterdeck where their wings would be extended and then they would be lowered into the water by the large crane at the very stern of the ship.Jordan, p. 30 The hangar was surmounted by four Penh√∂et compressed-air catapults, each with a launch capacity of . The smaller fighter and reconnaissance seaplanes were lifted through large hatches in the hangar roofs by one of the four cranes mounted at each corner of the hangar and mounted on the catapult. During trials in 1937, it took three hours to embark or disembark a group of 16 aircraft, 17 minutes to embark a single Gourdou-Leseurre GL-812 reconnaissance floatplane, and seven minutes to launch a section of four floatplanes by catapult.Jordan, p. 31 Aircraft Commandant Teste was designed to accommodate the naval version of the Farman F.60 Goliath torpedo bomber, but they were obsolete when she was commissioned in 1932. Biplane Levasseur PL.14 torpedo bomber floatplanes were only briefly used as they proved to be too fragile for landing at sea. They were replaced by improved Levasseur PL.15 biplanes from July‚ÄìAugust 1934. The Lat√©co√®re 298 monoplane replaced the PL.15 in March‚ÄìMay 1939. The scouting squadron was initially equipped with fixed-wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-810 floatplanes until the folding wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-811 arrived in October 1933. They were replaced in turn by the improved Gourdou-Leseurre GL-813 in early 1936. The larger Loire 130 flying boat replaced the GL-813 from April 1938, although the catapults had to be modified to handle their greater weight. No fighter seaplanes were ever embarked on Commandant Teste, although the Loire 210 floatplane was designed for the role. However, it proved to be greatly out-classed by contemporary land-based fighters and only 20 were built in 1939.Jordan, p. 35 Service history Commandante Teste served with the Mediterranean Squadron upon commissioning in 1932. She was refitted between November 1935 and August 1936 when her 100 mm guns were given gun shields. From September 1937, she was based at Oran to protect neutral shipping from commerce raiders during the Spanish Civil War. In February 1938, she was refitted in Toulon to upgrade her catapults and then served as an aviation transport between France and her colonies in North Africa.Jordan, p. 36 In August 1939, she embarked six Loire 130s and eight Lat√©co√®re 298s and sailed for Oran, where she was when World War II began the next month. Commandant Teste remained in North African waters until December 1939, when she returned to Toulon and landed her aircraft. She served as an aircraft transport between French North Africa and Metropolitan France for the first half of 1940. In late June 1940, she was transferred from the over-crowded anchorage at Oran to Mers El K√©bir. She was lightly damaged by shell splinters during the British attack on Mers-el-K√©bir on 3 July 1940, but suffered no casualties. She arrived at Toulon on 18 October where she was subsequently disarmed. In June 1941, Commandant Teste was reactivated as a gunnery training ship. She was at Toulon when the Germans invaded Vichy France and was scuttled there on 27 November 1942 to avoid capture by the Germans. Refloated by the Italians on 1 May 1943, Commandant Teste was captured by the Germans in September 1943 and sunk again the following year by Allied bombs on 18‚Äì19 August 1944. Raised again in February 1945, she was still thought to be repairable and was considered for conversion as an escort or training carrier. The proposals were eventually dropped and the ship was used as a store ship for U.S.-built equipment until sold for scrap on 15 May 1950.Chesneau, p. 262 Notes References  * * Category:Seaplane tenders of the French Navy Category:Ships built in France Category:1929 ships Category:World War II aircraft carriers of France Category:Naval ships of France captured by Germany during World War II Category:World War II warships scuttled at Toulon Category:Maritime incidents in November 1942 Category:Maritime incidents in August 1944 ","title":"French seaplane carrier Commandant Teste"},{"id":"3644412","text":"The Red Streak was a tabloid format newspaper published in Chicago from October 2002 to December 2005.

The film is about a beautiful but ambitious young woman who joins a traveling troupe of third-rate vaudevillians and inadvertently causes jealousy and emotional crises. A collaboration with Alberto Lattuada in production, direction, and writing, Variety Lights launched Fellini's directorial career. Prior to this film, Fellini worked primarily as a screenwriter, most notably working on Roberto Rossellini‚Äôs Rome, Open City. Plot The filmdancers and performers struggle to make money from town to town, playing to minimal crowds, while the ageing manager of the company falls in love with a newcomer, to the chagrin of his faithful mistress Melina Amour, played by Fellini's real-life wife, Giulietta Masina. The movie begins with a sold-out vaudeville show in a small Italian town. A young woman, Liliana, played by Carla Del Poggio, sits in the appreciate crowd, enraptured by the performers. That evening, as the troupe boards a train, with two of the performers forced to sit in the train toilet to evade paying the fare, the young woman also boards the train. During the night, she unsuccessfully requests the head of the group, Checco Dal Monte, played by Peppino De Filippo, to join the group. In the morning when the group realizes it does not have enough money to pay for a carriage, Liliana hires the carriage with the last of her money. This saves the group several miles of walking and leads to them accepting her. At the performance that evening, a sparse and hostile crowd mocks each performer in turn. When the local promoter notices that the crowd responds approvingly to Liliana, he interrupts the performance and directs the group to feature the newcomer. This leads to repeat performances over the next two days to increasingly larger crowds. After the third and final performance, a local wealthy man invites the group to his mansion for dinner. That night Checco realizes he desires Liliana. In the morning, as the group walks towards the train station, Checco abandons his mistress Melina to walk alone with Liliana. When the group arrives in Rome, Checco leaves it in order to form his own troupe featuring Liliana. Desperate for money, he visits his old troupe and begs Melina for the funds to launch his show. Stricken, she hands him money and orders him to never contact her again. Checco takes the money triumphantly, but as this new group practices, Liliana arrives to tell him she has signed with a competitor. Checco collapses. The movie then follows Liliana in her brilliant debut in a minor role, hinting that she has a bright future ahead of her. The movie ends with Liliana, sporting an expensive fur coat, boarding a first-class train carriage en route to Milan. On the adjoining track, Checco and his old troupe board a train for Foggia. In the final scene, the two trains leave the station as Checco, reunited with Melina, begins to flirt with a young woman who sits across the aisle from him. This suggests he is about to begin the cycle once again.

The cartoon follows Donald Duck leading his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie on a scouting trip through the wilderness. It was directed by Jack King and features Clarence Nash as Donald and the three nephews. Good Scouts was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 11th Academy Awards in 1939, but lost to Disney's own Ferdinand the Bull. Also nominated that year from Disney were Brave Little Tailor and Mother Goose Goes Hollywood, setting the record for most nominations in the category for one studio. Good Scouts was the first Academy Award nomination for the Donald Duck series. Plot Donald Duck and his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie are on a scouting expedition at Yellowstone National Park with Donald acting as the Scoutmaster. The ducks march along in military style singing \\"Polly Wolly Doodle.\\" Arriving at their camp site, Donald unsuccessfully tries to teach the boys wilderness skills. He tries to chop down a petrified tree and pitch a tent with bad knots causing the nephews to laugh at his mistakes. Frustrated at the nephews' lack of gratitude for his efforts, Donald decides to make them sorry by pretending to have been injured, pouring ketchup over himself. The dutiful nephews spring into action and quickly bandage Donald from head to toe. Donald is then unable to see and wanders aimlessly, eventually falling into a honey jar. A large grizzly bear soon arrives having been attracted by the smell of food. Trying to escape the bear, Donald runs off a cliff and falls onto \\"Old Reliable Geyser\\" and gets his rear end stuck in the opening of the geyser. The water shoots Donald into the air, bringing him closer to the bear who is still above at the cliff's edge. The nephews try to save Donald by plugging the geyser with a long log and then with three stones, all of which prove unsuccessful. They finally roll a large boulder over it, but the geyser is only stopped momentarily before bursting again, with the water shooting Donald and the boulder up to the same level of the cliff, allowing the bear to jump on top of the boulder to chase Donald, with the boulder rotating under their feet, perfectly balanced on top of the continuous stream of water from the geyser. By nighttime, the chase is still ongoing, and the nephews, having exhausted their means of rescuing their uncle, bed down in their tent for the night, wishing him \\"Good night\\", \\"Unca\\", \\"Donald\\". Character development Good Scouts was the second animated appearance of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, who had first appeared in the Donald Duck comics, and marked a significant change in their behavior. In their earlier appearances, the triplets were mischievous and caused a lot of trouble for Donald. But in Good Scouts the boys seem to have matured a great deal. They are shown as being resourceful, using teamwork, and generally trying to help Donald out of trouble. Although the boys are seen as mischievous in several later appearance, it was this more helpful characterization which would become more characteristic of them. The film was also the first to show Donald in a leadership role. In earlier appearances he was \\"someone just trying to go about his business and getting interrupted and irritated by others.\\"Good Scouts at The Disney Film Project As such, the film was an influence on later films such as Sea Scouts (1939) and Home Defense (1943). Promotion On July 8, 1938, The Film Daily printed an item about the Disney Studio's promotion of the cartoon: \\"With the release of \\"Good Scouts,\\" a Disney with Donald Duck and his three nephews on high adventure in Yellowstone National Park... lookit!... a drawing of Donald and his nephews in Boy Scout uniform was presented to Dr. West, Chief Scout Executive, and an 8x10 print for each of a thousand Scout executives throughout the nation... publicity releases to 5,400 newspapers... reproduction of drawing in current Boys' Life and Scouting mags... stories in scout magazines...

It is an opening in the floor or base of the hull, platform, or chamber giving access to the water below, allowing technicians or researchers to lower tools and instruments into the sea. It provides shelter and protection so that even if the ship is in high seas or surrounded by ice, researchers can work in comfort rather than on a deck exposed to the elements. A moon pool also allows divers or small submersible craft to enter or leave the water easily and in a more protected environment. Moon pools can be used in chambers below sea level, especially for the use of scuba divers, and their design requires more complex consideration of air and water pressure acting on the moon pool surface. First use in oil drilling at sea Moon pools originated in the oil drilling industry, which uses them in drilling at sea or in lakes, to pass drilling equipment into the water from a platform or drillship.Oilfield Glossary: \\"Moon Pool'. Schlumberger website, retrieved 17 July 2007. Drill pipes need to run vertically through the structure or hull, and the moon pool provides the means to do this.

In this case, shown in part D of the diagram, there is no dry access between the chamber and the sea surface, and the moon pool is the only entry or exit to the chamber. Submerged chambers provide dry areas for work and rest without the need to ascend to the surface.Gregory Stone: \\"Deep Science\\". National Geographic Online Extra (Sept 2003). Retrieved 29 July 2007. This kind of submerged chamber uses the same principles as the diving bell, except they are fixed to the seafloor and may be called a wet porch, wet room, or wet bell. Sometimes the term moon pool is used to mean the complete chamber, not just the opening in the bottom and the air‚Äìwater interface. The alternative to a moon pool in an underwater habitat is the lock-out chamber, which is essentially like a fixed submarine, maintaining internal air pressures lower than ambient sea pressure down to 1 atmosphere, with an airlock to enable entry and exit underwater. Underwater habitats may have connected chambers with moon pools and lock-out chambers.

The band was one of the most successful exponents of the Neue Deutsche Welle movement of the 1980s. History The band was founded around the end of 1978, when they began their career as a German punk rock band; later they were ascribed to the Neue Deutsche Welle (NDW) movement, though their music is not typical of the NDW genre. It was influenced heavily by punk rock music, and their lyrics were often critical of politics and society. The members viewed themselves as punks, whose only association with the NDW was that they appeared at the same time. As testament to that, they wrote on their homepage: \\"Ja wir haben den Schei√ü eben mitgemacht!\\" (Yeah, we went along with that shit). The highlight of their career was seen from 1981 until 1983, as they played for sold-out crowds, had records go Gold and Platinum and were pictured on the cover of BRAVO. After two band members left the group in 1983, they released two albums: Europa and LP der Woche. After a creative break until 1987, the band returned with an album that was heavily influenced by The Cure. In the 1990s, Extrabreit moved onto writing lyrics highly critical of society and full of sharp sarcasm (a little bit similar to Dead Kennedys). Their new work did not enjoy the same commercial success of their earlier albums. After their 'Final concert' in the \\"Berlet Halle\\" Hagen - Hohenlimburg on 19 September 1998, the group went on to play in Bochum in 2002 and are touring Germany. Also they had in 2010 a concert with the Philharmonic Orchestra Hagen. In the past they recorded songs with Hildegard Knef, Harald Juhnke and Marianne Rosenberg.

Soft serve has been sold commercially since the late 1930s in the US. The term soft serve dates from before 1959 (New York Times, June 22, 1958, page F11) In the US, soft serve is not sold prepackaged in supermarkets, but is common at fairs, carnivals, amusement parks, restaurants (especially fast food and buffet), and specialty shops. All ice cream must be frozen quickly to avoid crystal growth. With soft serve, this is accomplished by a special machine that holds pre-mixed product at a very low, but not frozen, temperature at the point of sale.  History  Soft serve topped with Thai see-iw dum (black sweet soy sauce) served at Yaowarat, Bangkok, Thailand Over Memorial Day weekend of 1934, Tom Carvel, the founder of the Carvel brand and franchise, suffered a flat tire in his ice cream truck in Hartsdale, New York. He pulled into a parking lot and began selling his melting ice cream to vacationers driving by. Within two days he had sold his entire supply of ice cream and concluded that both a fixed location and soft (as opposed to hard) frozen desserts were potentially good business ideas. In 1936, Carvel opened his first store on the original broken down truck site and developed a secret soft serve ice cream formula as well as patented super low temperature ice cream machines. Dairy Queen also claims to have invented soft serve. In 1938, near Moline, Illinois, J. F. McCullough and his son, Alex, developed their soft serve formula. Their first sales experiment was August 4, 1938, in Kankakee, Illinois at the store of their friend, Sherb Noble. Within two hours of the \\"all you can eat\\" trial sale, they had dished out more than 1,600 servings‚Äîmore than one every 4.5 seconds. It is a common myth that during the late 1940s, future UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher worked briefly as a chemist for food manufacturer J. Lyons and Co., at a time when the company had partnered with the United States distributor Mister Softee and was developing a soft-serve recipe that was compatible with the American machines. Thatcher's precise role at Lyons is unclear, but she is reported to have worked on the quality of cake and pie fillings as well as ice-cream, and researched saponification. In the 1960s, ice cream machine manufacturers introduced mechanized air pumps into vending machines, providing better aeration.  Characteristics  A mixture of chocolate and vanilla soft serve being dispensed, a new flavor colloquially referred to as swirl or twist Soft serve is generally lower in milk-fat (3 to 6 percent) than ice cream (10 to 18 percent) and is produced at a temperature of about compared to ice cream, which is stored at . Soft serve contains air, introduced at the time of freezing. The air content, called overrun, can vary from 0 to 60 percent of the total volume of finished product. The amount of air alters the taste of the finished product. Product with low quantities of air has a heavy, icy taste and appears more yellow. Ice cream with higher air content tastes creamier, smoother, and lighter and appears whiter. The optimum quantity of air is determined by other ingredients, if any, and individual taste. It is generally accepted that the ideal air content should be between 33 and 45 percent of volume. If more than this, the product loses taste, tends to shrink as it loses air, and melts more quickly than that with less air. Less than 33 to 45 percent, the product will not melt as quickly but will not taste good. Some forms of soft serve, like many other processed foods, have palm oil. All ice cream must be frozen quickly to avoid crystal growth. With soft serve, this is accomplished by a special machine at the point of sale. Pre-mixed product (see definitions below) is introduced to the storage chamber of the machine where it is kept at . When product is drawn from the draw valve, fresh mix combined with the targeted quantity of air is introduced to the freezing chamber either by gravity or pump. It is then churned and quick frozen and stored until required. While some machines only dispense one flavor of mix at a time, certain models of soft serve machines have an additional nozzle that dispenses a mixture of two separate flavors simultaneously. This mixture emerges in a distinct swirl pattern. It is classified as its own separate flavor on menus as swirl or twist. Pre-mix can be obtained in several forms: * Fresh liquid that requires constant refrigeration until needed. It can be stored for 5 to 7 days before bacteria spoils it. Quality can be severely compromised by bacterial contamination and handlers must exercise caution to maintain quality. * A powdered mix. This is a dried version of the liquid mix. It has the advantage of easy distribution and can be stored for long periods of time without spoiling. Water must be added prior to being churned and frozen. The disadvantage is that water quality cannot be guaranteed and some operators can put too much water in to make it go further. It also should be refrigerated to prior to use, as airborne and waterborne bacteria can infect it immediately and can grow quickly if the product is warm. Residual bacteria in the refrigerated storage compartment can also be activated by warm product being introduced. * Ultra heat treated mix, a liquid that has been sterilized and packed in sealed, sterile bags. It can last a very long time without refrigeration and can be poured into the soft serve freezer immediately upon opening. However it should be refrigerated to prior to use for the same reasons mentioned above. At the time of opening, quality can be guaranteed and bacterial counts are zero. Where it is available, health authorities consider it the safest form of soft serve mix on the market. It was first developed for commercial use in New Zealand in 1988 in a joint venture between Tatua Foods, a dairy company and Bernie Cook, owner of Blue Boy, a mobile franchise network.

DaleyBridgeport By Joanne Gazarek Bloom, Maureen F. Sullivan, Daniel Pogorzelski and the mother of former mayor Richard M. Daley. Daley served as first lady of the City of Chicago from her husband's appointing in April 1955 until his death in December 1976, and first mother from April 1989 until her death in February 2003. Biography =Early life and family= Daley was born Eleanor Guilfoyle in 1907, in the south side Chicago neighborhood of Canaryville, to a large Irish family. She was the daughter of Honora Bridget \\"Nora\\" (McAuliff) and Patrick H. Guilfoyle, an insurance agent.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?n=eleanor- daley-sis&pid;=801262&fhid;=2289 She met Richard J. Daley at a local ball game. Her brother, Floyd, who was a friend of Daley's, introduced the couple. Their first date was attending a Chicago White Sox game. Daley was a graduate of Saint Mary High School and was a secretary at a local paint company. After a six-year-long courtship, during which her future husband finished law school, they married on June 17, 1936. The Daley's lived in a modest brick bungalow at 3536 South Lowe Street, close to where both had grown up. They had three daughters and four sons, in that order. Their eldest son, Richard M. Daley, was mayor of Chicago from 1989 through 2011. The youngest son, William M. Daley, served as U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 1997-2000. Another son, John P. Daley, is a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. =Personality= Daley was a quiet woman who seldom spoke out on political matters. One exception was her criticism of Boss, the 1971 Mike Royko biography of Mayor Daley portraying the mayor in an unfavorable light. Always fiercely protective of her husband and family, she uttered sharp criticism of the book, and this led to one local retailer leaving the book off its shelves. In 1972, developers had obtained the city's tentative approval of a proposal to tear down the old Chicago Public Library downtown and replace it with a modern office tower. Asked her view of the proposal by a Chicago Tribune reporter, Sis Daley observed that she had used the library as a child, and said of the demolition, \\"I don't think that would be nice.\\" Soon thereafter, a city commission unanimously voted down the project. Of Sis, the mayor told the press: \\"She doesn't speak for me and I don't speak for her. She is able to speak for herself very well, whatever she has on her mind.\\" It was said that although her husband might have controlled every aspect of the city's government, she controlled everything inside their house. Later years/death In her later years as a widow and especially during her son's tenure as mayor she became something of a matriarch of Chicago, in fact her birthday of March 4 happens to also be the anniversary of the incorporation of the city. She attended events to honor her late husband at the University of Illinois at Chicago, including the dedication of the university library named after him in 1999 and on the centenary of his birth in 2002. Mrs. Daley died on February 16, 2003 in her Bridgeport home of a stroke 16 days shy of her 96th birthday as her son was running for a fifth term as mayor in the 2003 Chicago mayoral election.

Prior to his professional career he played college football at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which dropped its program after his junior season. Early years Born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Andrie graduated from Catholic Central High School in 1958. He chose to play football across Lake Michigan at Marquette, where his older brother Stan had played on the line in the early 1950s. The Marquette football team was historically known as the \\"Golden Avalanche\\", as well as the other Marquette nicknames of Hilltoppers and Warriors. During his sophomore and junior seasons (1959 & 1960), he led the team in receiving both years from his slotback position. As a two-way player, he was also ranked among the team's tackle leaders, registering over 80 tackles as a defensive lineman. After a 3‚Äì6 season in 1960 under head coach Lisle Blackbourn, the university dropped the football program in December, citing financial issues. After the school limited his scholarship to just the tuition fees, he explored an opportunity to transfer to Tulsa in 1961, but decided to return to Marquette, soon after visiting the school's campus. Unsure of his future at the professional level, he focused on academics and worked on his physical conditioning during his senior year. In 1991, he was inducted into the Marquette Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional career Idle in his senior season, he was off the radar of most pro teams, except for the Dallas Cowboys, who had just completed their second season in 1961 with a 4‚Äì9‚Äì1 record. Their player personnel director was Gil Brandt, who was born and raised in Milwaukee and was a Wisconsin alumnus. They selected Andrie in the sixth round (82nd overall) of the 1962 NFL draft as a defensive end. In his first season, he won the starting job at right defensive end (replacing Nate Borden) and also made the NFL All-Rookie team. In 1964, after playing on the left side of the defense, he was switched back to his original position at right defensive end, where he stayed throughout his career. He played most of his career next to future Hall of Fame defensive tackle Bob Lilly. Together they helped to form the Cowboys' original \\"Doomsday Defense\\". In the frigid 1967 NFL Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers, often referred to as the Ice Bowl, he picked up a Bart Starr fumble and ran it in for a touchdown, scoring six of the Cowboys' 17 points in the loss. In 1970 he competed in Super Bowl V, the first after the merger with the American Football League. The Cowboys faced the Baltimore Colts, but lost in a game known for the record 11 turnovers committed by both teams, as well as 10 penalties committed by the Cowboys. Andrie knocked out Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas with a shoulder tackle in the second quarter. In the 1971 NFC Championship game he made another pivotal play. He intercepted a John Brodie pass near the San Francisco 49ers' 10-yard line and took it to the 2-yard line, setting up a Calvin Hill game-winning touchdown. He was a member of the Cowboys when they beat the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI. The NFL didn't recognize quarterback sacks as an official stat until 1982; however, the Cowboys have their own records, dating back before the 1982 season. According to the Cowboys' stats, Andrie is unofficially credited with a total of 97 sacks, leading the Cowboys in sacks each year from 1964 to 1967, with a high of 18.5 in 1966. Andrie also had eight straight games with a sack from 1966 to 1967, making it the fourth longest such streak in club history. He ranks fifth on the team's All-time sack leaders list. Andrie played defensive end for the Cowboys for 11 seasons, registering 112 straight regular-season starts and only two missed games in his career, with a dislocated elbow in 1963. He was named to the Pro Bowl five straight times (1965‚Äì1969), All-Pro once and three times second-team All-Pro during his career. He was also named the Pro Bowl MVP in 1970, after a temporary retirement in training camp due to a $2,000 salary dispute. Personal life Andrie worked with Cowboy teammate Lilly in a beer distribution business in Waco, before founding a promotional products company in 1979. Andrie has seven children with his wife, Mary Lou. Andrie was first diagnosed with dementia in 2014, and despite two claims filed in the 2017 NFL concussion settlement, those claims have been both denied, and his family is appealing both. Andrie's efforts in navigating the settlement has highlighted the complicated nature of the claims process in the settlement.https://www.npr.org/2018/05/16/611727815/why-the-nfls-concussion- settlement-isnt-easy-to-navigatehttps://deadspin.com/what-its-like-to- navigate-the-nfls-concussion-settlemen-1825471309 He died on August 21, 2018, aged 78.

This was the second time the United States allowed individuals to indicate more than one race on the census. Multiracialism is a conceptual framework used to theorize and interpret identity formation in global multiracial populations. Multiracialism explores the tendency for multiracial individuals to identify with a third category of 'mixed-ness' as opposed to being a fully accepted member of multiple, or any, racial group(s). As an analytical tool, multiracialism strives to emphasize that societies are increasingly composed of multiracial individuals, warranting a broader recognition of those who do not fit into a society's clear-cut notions of race. Additionally, multiracialism also focuses on what identity formation means in the context of oppressive histories and cultural erasure. Multiracial identities have manifested themselves in many different ways across cultural identities, historical moments, and social norms. The meaning of what it is to be multiracial changes depending on what society is in question. As a result, multiracialism is often used to critique the continuation of race as a means of social categorization, especially given that race is a social and political construct that has served systems of oppression and systematically overlooked large populations that fall between its limited categorizations. Conceptual history As argued by King et al. in Global Mixed Race, racial mixing and multiracial identities have existed for centuries. The emergence of multiracial identities in the United States is often attributed to the repeal of anti-miscegenation laws and the subsequent legalization of interracial marriages. However, this has been disproven by documented histories of miscegenation in the United States beginning in the 17th and 18th centuries. Furthermore, anti-miscegenation laws weren't established globally, problematizing the scope of this argument's relevance transnationally. Instead, the emergence and growth of multiracial populations can be more accurately attributed to global and transnational phenomenon such as changes in trade patterns and migration flows as a result of historical events, colonization, and or globalization. Additionally, the application of multiracialism, as well as the size of a nation's multiracial population, will be unique across societies. This can be attributed to the function of race as a social and political construct, one which was developed in order to more easily distribute resources and determine status within societies. The nature of race as a construct leads to racial ideals adopting additional or contrary meaning across different societies. Furthermore, the meaning societies associate with different racial groups evolves over time. Increased opportunities for interracial relationships and interaction are often attributed to what scholars Small and King-O‚ÄôRiain would call tenants of globalization, which provide opportunities for racial learning and a less hegemonic understanding of unfamiliar racial groups. Small and King-O‚ÄôRiain contend that globalization has opened new avenues for increasing hybridity and social acceptance of multiracial identities while recognizing that the nature of race as a construct means that these global conversations on racial ideals will ultimately manifest themselves differently across local contexts.  Regional racial classification  = Brazil = The colonial history of Brazil established the framework for the system of racial hierarchy present in the nation today. Colonial ties to Portugal provided the opportunity for European racial ideals to enter Brazil and establish Eurocentric racial projects. One of the most impactful social influences established by Portugal was the incorporation of Brazil into the African slave trade. This industry was extensive, leading Brazil to be considered one of the two largest slaveholding nations in the Americas with records showing that Brazil imported ten times as many slaves as America, and estimates holding that approximately 3.6 million Africans were brought to Brazil during the three and a half centuries of Portuguese rule. Not only did these circumstances lead to the circulation of racial ideology, but they also constructed a unique racial distribution within Brazil. Despite a lack of data during the early colonial period, scholars widely accept that white settlers in Brazil made up a minority of the population throughout this era. In 1600, the white residents in Brazil amounted to merely one third of the population, and estimates show that by 1798 the population of 3 million was composed of around 1,000,000 white Brazilians, 1,500,000 slaves, 225,000 Freed Coloreds (typically individuals of multiracial heritage), and 250,000 Native Americans. The increasing number of Africans in Brazil led to this population supplementing and eventually replacing the Native American labor force. These three categories‚ÄîEuropean, African, and Native American‚Äîwere placed within a racial hierarchy established around a Eurocentric agenda; the particular system implemented in Brazil was known as the ternary racial project, which was popularized by anthropologist Gilberto Freyre. This system was established in order to validate the nation's extensive miscegenation practices, creating three categories of classification: white, multiracial, and black. Brazil never passed anti-miscegenation laws, and instead, viewed miscegenation as a means to slowly whiten the Brazilian population. But focusing on this lack of legalized racial discrimination resulted in the misconception that Brazilian society was also free of racism, a concept known as \\"racial democracy\\" wherein Brazil was free of discrimination such as segregation and racial violence. The theory of \\"racial democracy\\" was further developed in the 1930s as a means to reconcile nationalist anti-immigration sentiment, the perceived failure of the state initiative to whiten Brazil, and the growing multiracial population. Freyre interpreted Brazil's mixed-race population as being the defining characteristic of Brazil: a country where one could live in a harmonious, multiracial society. In line with this agenda, social status in Brazil was not exclusively determined by race; instead, it can be argued that an individual's social identity is more impacted by physical appearances in combination with class and cultural practices. By creating a third category in the ternary system, multiracial individuals were given more vertical social mobility than Brazilians of African descent. However, multiracial identities were further stratified, with the order of desirability being as follows: mamelincos (European and Native American), mulatto (European with either Native American or African), and catusos (Native American and African); wherein mamelincos and mulatto identities had more opportunities for mobility than those of catusos heritage. Further effects of the ternary system are seen in how Brazilian slave holders incorporated the population of Freed Coloreds, typically mulattos, as enforcers of the racial hierarchy. By buying into the enforcement of the status quo, multiracial individuals were emplacing themselves in this system‚Äîboth as superior to black Brazilians and complacent as second-class citizens to white Brazilians. This is further explained through the ‚Äúmulatto escape hatch‚Äù, wherein individuals who were visibility of mixed heritage would be granted situational permission to identify as white due to their talents and assets such as education level or learned skills. By employing this social strategy in the context of the ternary system, Brazilian elites were able to keep the most outspoken and skilled multiracial individuals from critiquing the unequal status quo. Due to the operation of this racialized system, it became favorable for Brazilians to present themselves as belonging to Native American or European heritages while simultaneously distancing themselves from African descendancy. Identity formation in Brazil although deeply rooted in the nation's colonial past has and continues to be confronted and changed. Evidence of this is seen in the 1970s through Brazil's Black Movement, as well as the counter movement in 2001 known as Brazil's Multiracial Movement. These incidents among other modern developments in Brazilian politics have led to the shifting of racial discourse in the nation. Interviews conducted by the National Public Radio (NPR) in 2019 consulted Brazilians on their experiences with multiracialism in their nation and how this impacts self-identification. The focus of the report was on the affirmative action mandate established as federal law in Brazil during 2014. This policy enacted a quota wherein 20% of students accepted to federal universities and 20% of all employees working civil service jobs must be black. By establishing benefits in the form of increased quality of education and financial security, NPR substantiated that the government of Brazil had provided the population with an incentive to (re)claim African heritage. And with such an extensive history of multiracial descendancy, it is difficult to visually determine whether an applicant is actually of African descent. Each individual who indicates black on these applications must be verified by the anti-fraud commission and determined to be black based upon facial features‚Äîa process which is informed by Brazilian society's tendency to prioritize appearance over heritage in terms of identity formulation. =United States= The colonial history of the United States has provided the basis for the nation's current race relations. As European colonial empires expanded in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, European constructions of race were spread globally. The concepts of race and racial hierarchies were developed as a means to justify emerging forms of exploitation during the colonial era. These emerging social constructs provided a framework for societies to categorize individuals and subsequently place them within a hierarchy‚Äîtypically seen with what is defined as ‚Äòwhite‚Äô at the top and ‚Äòblack‚Äô at the bottom. Professor of sociology, G. Reginald Daniel elaborates that these systems were ultimately constructed and employed as a means by which the practice of enslaving Africans could be defended. Slavery provided the context for the emergence of multiracial identities in colonial America as African slaves and European indentured servants formed interracial unions. But the multiracial children of these relationships were perceived as a threat to the purity of the white race, and anti-miscegenation laws were promptly passed in the 1660s to preserve distinct racial categories. Further means of legitimizing the construct of race in the United States emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century through what was known as racial science or scientific racism. These ideologies were eventually disproven; however, at the time of their rise, they occupied a critical role in American scholarship's understanding and depiction of human beings. Racial sciences gained additional credibility due to the illustrious reputations of the scholars who conceptualized the field, such as Louis Agassiz a leading member of the American School of Ethnology from Harvard University. Eurocentric frameworks brought to the United State through colonial ties led to the emergence of a binary racial project wherein ‚Äòblackness‚Äô and ‚Äòwhiteness‚Äô are presented as opposite ends of a racial spectrum with no categories in between. This limitation lends multiracial individuals to being perceived in relation to either extreme of the spectrum, and not as occupying the space between black and white despite how they personally identify. This phenomenon can be further explained through the history of the one-drop rule, a means of racial categorization which emerged during the Jim Crow era in the American South. In effect, the one-drop rule upheld that Americans with any African heritage would be considered fully black. This policy barred multiracial descendants of black Americans from accessing the higher social statuses of their white family members, while also refusing to acknowledge the existence of multiracial identities. Remnants of the one-drop rule are still evident today as multiracial Americans of African heritage are still often perceived as black instead of multiracial. U.S. Census Bureau survey section on race from 1990. Participants were only allowed to indicate one race from a limited set of options. The Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s inspired discourse which dramatically changed the perception of multiracial identities in the United States. In 1967, the Supreme Court Case Loving v. Virginia repealed all remaining anti-miscegenation laws, deeming these practices to be unconstitutional. As a result, the 1970s saw a rise in biracial marriages, a trend which is still evident decades later. In the 2000 U.S. Census, Americans were able to self-identify as more than one racial group, marking the first time that multiracial identities were legally recognized by the United States. Calculations based on the U.S. Census Bureaus‚Äô s 2005-2015 American Community Surveys and 2000 decennial census show that the number of individuals who identify as more than one race rose by 106 percent between 2000 and 2015. Furthermore, a 2018 report from the U.S. Census Bureau projects that, if trends continue, the multiracial population will triple in size by 2060. With the rise of multiracial identities in the United States, multiracialism has become an increasingly popular framework. Scholars such as Lauren D. Davenport, a political science professor from Stanford University, are exploring how the increasing number of Americans self identifying as multiracial has the potential to impact political affiliations and minority solidarity. Davenport stresses how this has raised serious concerns in the African American community, as multiracial individuals with black heritage have been instrumental in promoting the political agendas of the black community. The main concern is that growing solidarity among the multiracial community will lead to other minority groups losing impassioned support from a critical group of allies. In fact, this is one of the reasons why the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the National Urban League saw the push for a multiracial category on the U.S. Census in 1990 as a threat to black solidarity. Additionally, multiracialism has been used to frame the expansion of the multiracial population as evidence of America becoming a post racial democracy. The merging of races has been interpreted as evidence of incremental steps toward racial equality and social progress; however, the mixing of these identities has been occurring for centuries, and the social benefits of multiracialism have not been well researched or supported.

The third of these was redesignated VFC-12 and is the main subject of this article. Officially, the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage with disestablished squadrons if a new squadron is formed with the same designation.http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq6-1.htm Often, the new squadron will assume the nickname, insignia, and traditions of the earlier squadrons. =First VC-12= The first Composite Squadron Twelve was originally established as VC-12 on 6 October 1943 at NAS Sand Point, Seattle, Washington. The squadron operated the F4F Wildcat and TBM-1 Avenger aboard in the western Pacific until the carrier changed homeport to Norfolk, Virginia in 1944. In the Atlantic theater, VC-12 flew combat missions against German U-boats, logging 34 engagements. On 7 June 1945, VC-12 was disestablished. =Second VC-12= On 6 July 1948 Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron Two (VAW-2) was established at NAS Norfolk. On 1 September 1948 it was re- designated Fleet Composite Squadron Twelve (VC-12). VC-12 operated detachments of TBM-3W Avengers, AF-2W Guardians and AD-5W Skyraiders from Atlantic Fleet carriers. During the Korean War, a VC-12 detachment saw combat while operating from . In July 1956 this second VC-12 was redesignated VAW-12. On 1 April 1967 the squadron was disestablished and its detachments were established as separate VAW squadrons VAW-121, VAW-122 and VAW-123. =Current VFC-12= F/A-18B lands on the in 2005 On 1 September 1973, at NAF Detroit, Michigan, the current squadron was established as VC-12, the Navy's first Reserve Fleet Composite Squadron. The squadron employed the single seat A-4 Skyhawk and dual seat TA-4Js in providing multiple support services, including air intercept and dissimilar air combat maneuvering (ACM) training for Atlantic and Pacific fleet units. In 1975, VC-12 moved to its current home at NAS Oceana, Virginia Beach, Virginia. In June 1988, VC-12 was re-designated Fighter Squadron Composite Twelve (VFC-12) to more accurately describe the squadron's mission of Dissimilar Air Combat Training. In 1994 the unit transitioned to the F/A-18A/B Hornet. In 2004, the A's were upgraded to the A+, which included upgraded mission computers and weapons capabilities. In 2006, VFC-12 traded these F/A-18 A+ models (which had low arrested landing fatigue life) for F/A-18C's from VFA-87. Finally in 2012, VFC-12 traded jets again with VFA-87 so they are now flying the F/A-18A+. Mission The squadron's primary focus is support to the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP), which trains operational fleet F/A-18 squadrons. SFARP is an intense three week training exercise, conducted by the Strike Fighter Weapons School Atlantic, that allows fleet Strike Fighter aircrews to hone their war fighting skills against a creditable adversary prior to deploying. In addition to the SFARP program, VFC-12 supports the F/A-18 Fleet Replacement Squadrons at NAS Oceana and with detachments to NAS Key West. VFC-12 often averages more than 200 days a year on detachments. Awards VFC-12 was awarded the Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety Award in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1992 and 1998. VFC-12 was awarded the Noel Davis Trophy for squadron readiness for 1980, 1984, 1985, 1995 and 1998.

It is based on the 1721 play The Love Suicides at Amijima by Monzaemon Chikamatsu. This play is often performed in the bunraku style (that is, with puppets). In the film, the story is performed with live actors, but also makes use of Japanese theatrical traditions such as the kuroko (stagehands dressed entirely in black) who invisibly interact with the actors, and the set is non-realist. The film opens with the preparations by the kuroko for a modern-day presentation of a puppet play while a voice-over is heard of someone, presumably the director, calling on the telephone to find a location for the penultimate scene of the lovers' suicide. Soon human actors are substituted for the puppets, and the action proceeds in a naturalistic fashion, until from time to time the kuroko intervene to accomplish scene shifts or heighten the dramatic intensity of the two lovers' resolve to be united in death. The stylized sets and the period costumes and props simultaneously convey a classical theatricality and contemporaneous modernity. Jihei's fatal love interest, Koharu the prostitute, and his neglected wife, Osan, are both played by actress Shima Iwashita.

Italian-American food has been shaped throughout history by various waves of immigrants and their descendants, called Italian Americans. As immigrants from the different regions of Italy settled throughout the various regions of the United States, many brought with them a distinct regional Italian culinary tradition. Many of these foods and recipes developed into new favorites for the townspeople and later for Americans nationwide. Prominent American chefs and cooks working in the Italian-American tradition include Giada De Laurentiis, Mario Batali, Michael Chiarello, Frank Pellegrino, Rocco DiSpirito, Tom Colicchio and Lidia Bastianich. Traditional influences Risotto Italian-American food is based primarily on the culinary traditions of Southern Italian immigrants, although a significant number of Northern Italian immigrants also came to the United States and also influenced this style of cuisine to some extent. Most of these immigrants arrived in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and during this time, many Italians coming from Naples and Sicily moved to large American cities, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; the immigrant cuisine is thus largely derived from Neapolitan and Sicilian cuisine, and is particularly associated with these locations. Italian-Americans often identify foods with their regional heritage. Southern Italian staples include dry pasta, tomato sauce, and olive oil, whereas Northern Italian staples include foods such as risotto, white sauce and polenta. Over time, through an increased appreciation of Italian cuisine in the United States, as well as increased imports into the United States from Italy, there has been a push towards producing more authentic dishes, which use techniques and ingredients that are more native to Italy. American cuisine has readily received innovations from Italy, such as espresso (which evolved into specialty coffee drinks, now ubiquitous in American life), tiramisu, and Nutella. On the other hand, e.g. Pasta alla Carbonara, a dish unrecorded in Italy before World War II may be due to an American influence in relationship to the allied liberation of Rome in 1944. Many Italians then were happy to use powdered eggs and bacon supplied by the United States and their armed forces for pasta dishes. Popularity of Italian-American cuisine Italian-American food and Mediterranean cuisine has been highly influential in the American diet. It is one of the top three cuisines in the United States, according to the National Restaurant Association: Rated high on the list of popular, or trending, items in the survey include: Mediterranean flatbread, ciabatta bread, espresso and specialty coffee drinks.Stensson, Anita, National Restaurant Association news release, \\"Small is Big on Restaurant Menus ...\\" 29 November 2007. Pizza and pasta are also common dishes in the United States; however, they are often presented in much different forms than in Italy. Italian-American cuisine and wine There is a strong association between Italian-American cuisine with the history of winemaking in the United States. Many Italian wines were first introduced to the United States in the late 1700s. Italian vintners were first brought to the state of Florida in 1766 by Dr. Andrew Turnbull, a British Consul at Smyrna (now Izmir). Philip Mazzei, an Italian physician, and close friend of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, also helped to cultivate vineyards, olives, and other Mediterranean fruit with the help of Italians. In later years, American viticulture was more influenced by the Italian diaspora of the transatlantic migrations, which steadily brought more Italians to America from the 1870s through the 1920s. Most of these Italians entered the East Coast of the United States through Ellis Island, whereas many of those quickly passed through to the American West Coast, where California still had its famous \\"Gold Rush\\". In California, Italian-Americans were inspired by the expanse of rolling hills and fertile fields. Prior to Prohibition starting in 1919, many wineries had made their start: Seghesio, Simi, Sebastiani Vineyards and Foppiano began in the late 19th century and remain in operation today. Others included Giuseppe Magliavacca's Napa winery, Secondo Guasti's Italian Vineyard Company and Andrea Sbarbaro's Italian-Swiss Colony. From 1919 until the Repeal of Prohibition in 1933, many Italian- Americans struggled to keep their vineyards going. Many remained through providing sacramental wine to the Catholic Church or grape juice to the general market. These few holdouts can be credited with salvaging America's viticulture heritage, in an industry that values the longevity and tradition of the vine and its produce. Today, Italian-American wineries prove a powerful asset on the world market. Some of these companies include: Atlas Peak (also known as Antinori), Cosentino, Dalla Valle, Delicato, Ferrari-Carano, E & J Gallo Winery, Geyser Peak (also known as Trione family), Louis M. Martini, Mazzocco, Robert Mondavi, Monte Bello Ridge, Corrado Parducci, Pedroncelli Winery, Robert Pepi, Picchetti Brothers Winery, Rochioli, Rafanelli, Rubicon Estate Winery (also known as Francis Ford Coppola Presents), Sebastiani Vineyards, Signorello, Sattui, Trinchero (most often under the Sutter Home brand), Valley of the Moon, Viansa, etc. Italian-Americans today appreciate a variety of wines, ranging from California wine and American wine, to imported Italian wine; with classics, such as Chianti (from Tuscany, Italy), generic red or white table wine (often called vino da tavola), to high-end \\"Super Tuscan\\" style wines such as Tignanello. Chianti, when first introduced to the United States, was widely generic; however, after a decline in the overall quality of Chianti during the mid-20th century, improvements in recipes and techniques led to a variety of Chianti, ranging from simple to very high-end Classicos. Dishes =Pastas and grains= * American chop suey ‚Äì a distant relative of Rag√π bolognese made primarily with hamburger meat * Baked ziti ‚Äì Ziti pasta, originally from Sicily, tube-shaped pasta similar to penne but much longer, mixed with a tomato sauce and covered in cheese, then baked in the oven * Lasagna, particularly using ricotta, called \\"lasagne alla napoletana\\" in Italy. The ricotta distinguishes it from the original and better-known (outside the U.S.) North Italian style that uses b√©chamel sauce, called \\"lasagne alla bolognese\\" or just \\"lasagne\\" * Penne alla vodka ‚Äì The sauce of this pasta dish consists of tomato, onion, prosciutto, cream and vodka. * Polenta ‚Äì Cornmeal mash, made in a varying degree of thicknesses depending on the intended use of the final product and often flavored with cheese or butter. Sometimes served with a meat sauce, or with deli meats. * Spaghetti and meatballs ‚Äì A dish based on Neapolitan festival dishes involving much smaller meatballs as well as other ingredients.Corby Kummer, \\"Pasta\\", The Atlantic, July 1986 full text It is iconic in the United States. =Vegetable dishes= * Eggplant parmesan or melanzane alla parmigiana is a common Italian dish. It typically includes sliced eggplant, marinara sauce, and Parmesan cheese, layered repeatedly. It is never served on or with spaghetti in Italy and there are no meat \\"parmigianas\\" though zucchini- and artichoke-based versions do exist. * Peas and eggs ‚Äì originally a meal eaten by poor Italian immigrants has since become a favorite lenten meal. It consists of simply eggs and peas, fried in a pan with olive oil and some garlic, onion and pepper. =Meats and eggs= * Frittata ‚Äì An open-faced omelette. There can be potatoes and eggs, peas and eggs, asparagus and eggs, peppers and eggs, cucuzza (i.e., squash) and eggs, onions and eggs, etc. These can be eaten by themselves or on sandwiches. * Sausage and peppers ‚Äì Salsiccia, peppers and onions cooked together, sometimes with a very light red sauce. * Porchetta, also known as \\"porketta\\", Italian roast pork, roast pork, roast pork sandwich, or Italian pulled pork depending on the region of the U.S. ‚Äì Roast pork butt or shoulder; often a full suckling pig. Traditionally a holiday or celebration dish or found at festivals or fairs. However, it is commonly eaten in a sandwich form, usually with broccoli rabe, in Philadelphia's Italian-American communities and in recent times throughout the city. Brought to America mostly by immigrants from Abruzzo, as well as those from Lazio (especially the Alban Hills), Marche, and Tuscany. * Chicken (or Veal) Parmesan ‚Äì fried breaded chicken or veal cutlets covered in sauce and cheese, served with pasta. A very popular dish in casual dining restaurants, as well as a sandwich filling. The name of this dish is often abbreviated to \\"parm\\". * Chicken marsala ‚Äì chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine. * Chicken Francese was developed by Italian American restaurateurs after the Second World War, when French food became popular after GIs returning from France had developed a taste for it. =Sauces= * Alfredo sauce ‚Äì derived from the Fettuccine Alfredo made popular by Roman restaurateur Alfredo di Lelio starting in 1914, American Alfredo sauce consists largely of cream, butter, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese with nutmeg and black pepper seasonings, and is served over vegetables and some meats (particularly chicken and shellfish) as well as the signature pasta ribbons. The authentic Alfredo dish only consists of Fettuccine pasta, butter and parmigiano reggiano. The primary difference between authentic fettuccine Alfredo and Alfredo sauce is that while the pasta dish is prepared by adding ingredients to the cooked pasta, Alfredo sauce is prepared in bulk and poured over pasta or other ingredients (vegetables such as broccoli and meats such as shrimp or grilled chicken are common additions). Though very popular in the United States, this sauce is virtually unheard of in Italy * Marinara sauce ‚Äì a quick-cooking, sometimes spicy tomato sauce without meat served on pasta. \\"Salsa al Pomodoro\\" is the usual Italian name * Bolognese sauce ‚Äì a meat-based sauce originating from Bologna, Italy * Sunday sauce ‚Äì a meat-infused tomato sauce commonly made on Sundays and special occasions; derived from the Italian rag√π napoletano. In some areas, including Boston, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, it is sometimes called \\"gravy\\". =Seafood dishes= * Lobster Fra Diavolo ‚Äì A pasta dish made with lobster, and sometimes other seafood, that contains crushed red pepper to make it spicy. * Baccal√† ‚Äì salt cod fish, traditionally served during Lent or for Christmas Eve. Can have it fried, baccala salad, etc. * Alici or Acciughe ‚Äì another integral dish served during Christmas Eve's Feast of the Seven Fishes. This dish's full name is Spaghetti con aglio, olio e acciughe (spaghetti with garlic, oil, and anchovies; alici is another word for anchovy). The anchovies and garlic are sliced very thin and dissolve in the oil. When served, the dish appears to be just pasta covered in hot oil. (Many variants exist in Italy: some don't have anchovies, some add capers or chili pepper) =Soups and stews= * Cioppino ‚Äì a fish stew characteristic of West Coast Italian American cookery, particularly San Francisco. * Wedding soup ‚Äì A soup with meatballs or sausage and pasta in a chicken broth. * Pasta e fagioli (or \\"pasta fazool\\" in Italian- American slang, from Southern Italian fasule (\\"beans\\") instead of standard Italian fagioli) ‚Äì Pasta with beans, often cannellini beans, that has the consistency of a stew. =Breads, sandwiches, and savory baked goods= New York-style pizza, at Di Fara Pizza Chicago-style pizza * Calzone and stromboli ‚Äì While the half-moon shaped Italian calzone is well known in the United States, the very similar tube-shaped stromboli as well as large, loaf-like calzones served in slices are also fairly common. * Italian bread ‚Äì Perhaps a bit closer to French bread in composition and appearance, American \\"Italian bread\\" is a lean white bread, often braided and covered in sesame seeds, with a thin but usually crisp crust and a soft crumb. American \\"Italian bread\\" does not particularly resemble many traditional Italian bread forms, but is very popular in both loaf form and roll form, where it is often closely associated with sandwich making. * Pizza ‚Äì The most common form of American pizza is based on (and called) the Neapolitan style, the earliest and essentially standard version of which is commonly called \\"New York-style.\\" Also popular in America is a version of the Sicilian pizza, a larger square pie in which the dough is risen an inch or more, and which is topped (contrary to native Sicilian tradition) in much the same way as the thin-crusted round Neapolitan form, including the use of mozzarella. Even more Americanized forms such as Greek pizza, Apizza (i.e. New Haven-style pizza) and Chicago-style have become common. * Submarine sandwich ‚Äì originated in several different Italian American communities in the Northeastern United States from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. * Muffuletta ‚Äì a large sandwich with cold cuts and olive salad, made on a round loaf; originated in New Orleans * Italian beef sandwich‚Äîa type of roast beef sandwich native to Chicago, similar to a French dip sandwich. * Italian sandwich * Meatball sandwich * Pizzagiena or pizza ghen or \\"Pizza Rustica\\"- Easter Pie, made with various cheeses, eggs, and salted meats. Compare torta pasqualina, from Liguria, or the Italian-Argentine version, torta pascualina. Pizzagiena may also be called pasteed or pastiere, although it is more of a quiche than pie unlike pizzagiena. =Sweets= * Gelato ‚Äì Italian ice cream. * Tiramisu ‚Äì A sweet multi-layered cake with a light fluffy cream, often served with a coffee or other hot caffeinated beverage. Tiramisu is one of the more recent Italian imports, having been invented after World War II (probably in the Veneto region), but adopted readily by American diners. * Cannoli ‚Äì a sweet ricotta filling in a fried pastry shell * Struffoli (or Struf') ‚Äì Fried dough for dessert. Christmas cake typical of Naples. In Abruzzo, this dish is called \\"cicerchiata,\\" meaning \\"blue sweet pea-dish\\" and is eaten before Easter. * biscotti d'annodare ‚Äì knot cookies * Sfogliatelle ‚Äì a sort of custard turnover made with leaved (\\"foglie\\") pastry; a similar pastry, larger and filled with a type of pastry cream, is sometimes called a \\"lobster tail\\" * Biscotti ‚Äì generally anise flavored, often nut studded, hard cookie that may alternatively contain dried fruit or chocolate are common as well; often dipped in coffee rather than sweet dessert wines as in Italy. American biscotti are almost always loaf-type cookies that are sliced and rebaked to crispness, while the term refers to almost all forms of cookie in Italy. * Pizzelle ‚Äì traditional Italian waffle cookies made from flour, eggs, sugar, butter or oil, and flavoring (usually anise or anisette, less commonly vanilla or lemon zest). Originally from Abruzzo, brought over to the United States by Abruzzese immigrants. Popular during Christmas in the Northeastern United States among Italian-Americans and especially in Philadelphia and other cities where large numbers of Abruzzese immigrants settled.

Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Reference, 2011, p. 695, . Others argue that music-video models are depicted as sexual objects, signs of male power, and referred to in derogatory terms such as \\"bitch\\" and \\"slut\\".Hall, Ann C.; Mardia J. Bishop.

In 2005, former hip hop music-video model Karrine Steffans authored the book Confessions of a Video Vixen, in which she depicts the degradation of women in the world of hip hop.

The book went on to be a best seller in the US. Another hip hop model, Candace Smith, said in an XXL interview, \\"what I've seen on [hip hop music video] sets is complete degradation\\".Salaam, Khalid and Palting, Joaquin (2006). \\"Eye Candy: Tastes Like Candace\\" . XXL Magazine. New York: Harris Publications. Retrieved on February 11, 2006. Female rappers as video vixens Female rappers have most substantially felt this pressure, where sex appeal is now the currency by which women in the music business are both valued and devalued. In particular, female rappers such as Lil' Kim and Trina occupy what T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting calls a \\"peculiar place of cultural antipathy\\", often accused of selling out and blamed for participating in the exploitation of women. Similarly, Nicki Minaj is arguably a 'video vixen' who is the 'object, subject, and author' of sexually explicit music videos. Female rappers who have shown themselves off as \\"video vixens\\" include Nicki Minaj, Trina, Eve, Rasheeda, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma, Da Brat, Jacki-O, Shawnna, Gangsta Boo, LoLa Monroe, Diamond Princess, Cardi B and many others. The role of women has evolved over time in the hip-hop world. Two artists in the early era of hip-hop, rapper Roxanne Shante and rap group Salt-N-Pepa, were well-known for rapping about defending the image of women. They were responding to male hip-hop artists who habitually degrade women. Rappers Lil' Kim, Foxy Brown, Trina, Nicki Minaj, and many others are all opposite and seem to accept this hyper-sexuality.  Black women in hip hop  Audre Lorde, who spoke out for black girls who are considered video vixens, said: \\"If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive.\\" The images presented in mass media, specifically in music videos, portray hyper-sensual images of the female sex. These images created within the world of hip hop reinforce the negative stereotypes associated with women, especially with black women. It is pressuring for women musicians to conform to the porn standards because if not they will have to compete with the women who do. People realize that images of women is what rap music videos sell whether the women in the videos are playing the part of cheerleaders or die-hard groupies. Women in the videos are what gets the attention of men and guarantees a male audience. The images are still shots of women taken from videos displaying their appearance. Women are tended to dress half naked and moving their body in sexual ways. The media paint the picture that African American women are only seen as sexual figures in the society. Once these images are put out there these women are not the owner of their representation anymore.  Expressing femininity in hip hop  Gender Performance is an evolving category where hip hop artists express femininity in non-conventional ways that break the stereotype of the passive, hyper- sexualized female body as an object to be consumed. Throughout the genre in graffiti, breakdancing, and rapping, women are addressing the issues associated with the passive stereotype of female representation in hip hop. Feminist activism in hip hop re-examines the relationship women have to the hip hop culture, and how women choose to assert their sexuality. A form of femininity in hip hop is through asserting sexuality and using it as a dominant source of power, creating the notion of being liberated and a subject as opposed to an object. Artists within this category use blatant sexuality to their advantage as a part of their marketing and work. Due to the commodification of hip hop and stereotyping, the \\"sex sells\\" concept became prominent within mainstream hip hop culture. Successful career paths Some video vixens who have made a name for themselves in the music video industry, as well as girls with limited work as hip hop models, have gone on to other types of work with greater success, mostly by marketing themselves. Nicole Alexander became an American reality TV show contestant and is known for winning the VH1 reality television shows of Flavor of Love in its first season and I Love Money. Another reality show winner was Chandra Davis who won the second season of VH1's Flavor of Love competition.

It was directed and produced by Josef von Sternberg from a screenplay by Eleanor McGeary, loosely based on the diary of Catherine arranged by Manuel Komroff. Even though substantial historical liberties are taken, the film is viewed positively by modern critics.Roger Ebert, The Scarlet Empress Review, January 16, 2005.Derek Malcolm, Josef von Sternberg: The Scarlet Empress, May 25, 2000, The Guardian. The Scarlet Empress is particularly notable for its attentive lighting and the expressionist art design von Sternberg creates for the Russian palace. The film stars Marlene Dietrich as Catherine, supported by John Davis Lodge, Sam Jaffe, Louise Dresser, and C. Aubrey Smith. Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva plays Catherine as a child. Plot Princess Sophia Frederica (Marlene Dietrich) is the innocent daughter of a minor East Prussian prince and an ambitious mother. She is brought to Russia by Count Alexei (John Davis Lodge) at the behest of Empress Elizabeth (Louise Dresser) to marry her nephew, Grand Duke Peter (Sam Jaffe). The overbearing Elizabeth renames her Catherine and repeatedly demands that the new bride produce a male heir to the throne. This is impossible, because Peter never comes near her after their wedding night. He spends all his time with his mistress or his toy soldiers or his live soldiers. Alexei pursues Catherine relentlessly, with no success except for a quick kiss in a barn a week after the wedding, At dinner, he tries to pass a note to Catherine, begging for a few precious seconds with her, but Elizabeth intercepts it. She warns Catherine that Alexei is a womanizing heartbreaker. That night, Elizabeth sends Catherine down a secret stair to open the door to her lover‚Äîwithout letting him see her. It is Alexei. Shaken‚Äîand angry‚ÄîCatherine hurls a miniature he gave her out the window, then goes out into the garden to retrieve it. A handsome Lieutenant, on duty for the first time, pulls her aside. ‚ÄúIf you're the grand duchess, I'm the grand duke.‚Äù ‚Äú I wish you were!‚Äù she cries. ‚ÄúIf I were... I wouldn't let you prowl through the night like a pretty little kitten.‚Äù Suddenly, she throws her arms around his neck. They kiss, and she surrenders. Months later, all Russia‚Äîwith the exception of Peter‚Äîcelebrates as she gives birth to a son. Elizabeth promptly takes over his care and sends the exhausted Catherine a magnificent necklace. Catherine refuses to speak to Alexei. A text panel reads ‚Äú...Catherine discarded her youthful ideals and turned to the ambitious pursuit of power.‚Äù The Archimandrite is worried. Elizabeth is dying. Peter is insane and plans to remove Catherine from court, perhaps by killing her. This is a very different woman, self-assured, sensual and cynical. Now that she has learned what Russia expects, she plans to stay. He offers his help, but she demurs, smiling. ‚Äú I think I have weapons that are far more powerful than any political machine‚Äù. Catherine remains serene in the face of Peter's threats. She plays blind man's bluff with her ladies in waiting, lavishing kisses on the officers, until the bells toll for the empress' passing. Peter taunts Elizabeth's corpse as she lies in state: ‚ÄúIt's my turn now!‚Äù On screen: ‚ÄúAnd while his Imperial Majesty, Peter the III terrorized Russia, Catherine coolly added the army to her list of conquests.‚Äù She inspects the officers of Alexei's pet regiment, singling out Lieutenant Dmitri (the man from the garden) and borrowing one of Alexei's decorations to reward Dmitri ‚Äúfor bravery in action.‚Äù Dmitri's Captain also attracts her attention. She promises to explain everything to Alexei that evening. In her bedroom, she tells him to send everyone away and return. She toys with him and at last sends him downstairs to open the door for the man waiting there. It is the Captain. Alexei remembers and understands. At dinner, the Archimandrite collects alms for the poor. Catherine strips her arm of bracelets. The Captain adds a handful of gems, Alexei a purse, the Chancellor a single coin, Peter's mistress a scrap of food. Peter slaps his face. Peter proposes a toast the most charming woman in Russia, his mistress. Catherine refuses. Peter calls her a fool and she leaves with the Captain. Peter issues a proclamation that Catherine is dying. In the middle of the night, an officer wakens Catherine. In uniform, she flees the palace with her loyal troops. Alexei murmurs, ‚ÄúExit Peter the Third, Enter Catherine the Second.‚Äù In a flurry of banners they ride through the night, gathering men to her cause. In the cathedral, the Archimandrite blesses her and Catherine herself rings the bell that triggers a citywide peal. The guard at Peter's door tells him ‚ÄúThere is no emperor, only an empress‚Äù and kills him. Catherine and her troops ride up the stairs in the palace, thundering into the throne room as pealing bells are joined by the 1812 Overture.

Pyramid Publications, 1974. P. 51. To show Russia as backward, anachronistic and in need of reform, the imperial court was set at the Moscow Kremlin rather than in Saint Petersburg, a more Europeanized city. The royal palaces are represented as made of wood and full of religious sculptures (in fact, there is no free- standing religious sculpture in the Orthodox tradition). Pete Babusch from Switzerland created hundreds of gargoyle-like sculptures of male figures \\"crying, screaming, or in throes of misery\\" which \\"line the hallways, decorate the royal thrones, and even appear on serving dishes\\". This resulted in \\"the most extreme of all of the cinematic representations of Russia\\". In film critic Robin Wood's words: The Scarlet Empress was one of the later mainstream Hollywood motion pictures to be released before the Hays Code was enforced. Near the beginning of the film, young Sophia's tutor reads to her about ‚ÄúPeter the Great and Ivan the Terrible and other Russian Czars and Czarinas who were hangmen,‚Äù introducing a nightmarish and disturbingly explicit sequence of tortures and executions. For more about von Sternberg's choices in creating the film, see his wikipedia biography and the section titled The Scarlet Empress.  Reception  New York Times reviewer Dave Kehr described the film, with its \\"[metaphysical treatment\\" of the subject, as clearly superior to the contemporaneous rival Catherine biopic: The Rise of Catherine the Great (1934) by Alexander Korda.Dave Kehr, \\"Alexander Korda‚Äôs Historical Films Hold a Fun House Mirror Up to the Present,\\" May 6, 2009, New York Times, retrieved February 20, 2020 Leonard Maltin gives the picture three out of four stars: ‚ÄúVon Sternberg tells the story... in uniquely ornate fashion, with stunning lighting and camerawork and fiery Russian music. It's a visual orgy; dramatically uneven, but cinematically fascinating.‚Äù In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100. In a 2001 review of the film for the Criterion Collection, film scholar Robin Wood placed it in the context of the collaboration between Von Sternberg and Dietrich: > ‚ÄúThe connecting theme of all the von Sternberg/Dietrich films might be > expressed as a question: How does a woman, and at what cost, assert herself > within an overwhelmingly male-dominated world? Each film offers a somewhat > different answer (but none very encouraging), steadily evolving into the > extreme pessimism and bitterness of The Scarlet Empress and achieving its > apotheosis in their final collaboration The Devil Is a Woman. This resulted > in the (today extraordinary) misreading of the films (starting from The Blue > Angel) as ‚Äúfilms about a woman who destroys men.‚Äù Indeed, one might assert > that it is only with the advent of radical feminism that the films (and > especially the last two) have become intelligible‚Äù. The Guardian's historical films reviewer Alex von Tunzelmann credits the film with \\"racy\\" entertainment value (grade: \\"B\\"), but she severely discredits its historical depth and accuracy (grade: giving the film historical credence only for creating a \\"vaguely accurate impression\\" of Catherine's relationship with Peter, dismissing the rest as the director's fantasies and infatuations.von Tunzelmann, Alex \\"Reel history: The Scarlet Empress (1934)...This week: peasants on iron maidens and equine erotica in a biopic of Catherine the Great,\\" July 14, 2008, The Guardian, retrieved February 20, 2020 References External links   The Scarlet Empress an essay by Robin Wood at the Criterion Collection Category:1934 films Category:1930s historical drama films Category:1930s biographical drama films Category:American films Category:American historical drama films Category:American biographical drama films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films about Catherine the Great Category:Films set in Russia Category:Films set in Germany Category:Films set in the 18th century Category:Films directed by Josef von Sternberg Category:Works based on diaries Category:1934 drama films ","title":"The Scarlet Empress"},{"id":"3644677","text":"Harold Edward \\"Hal\\" Porter (16 February 1911 ‚Äì 29 September 1984) was an Australian novelist, playwright, poet and short story writer.

It is the third album the group released in the UK during 1969, all of which prominently feature Sandy Denny as lead female vocalist (Denny did not appear on the group's 1968 debut album), as well as the first to feature future long-serving personnel Dave Swarbrick and Dave Mattacks on violin/mandolin and drums, respectively, as full band members (Swarbrick had previously guested on Unhalfbricking). It is also the first Fairport album on which all songs have either been adapted (freely) from traditional British and Celtic folk material (for example \\"Matty Groves\\", \\"Tam Lin\\"), or else are original compositions (such as \\"Come All Ye\\", \\"Crazy Man Michael\\") written and performed in a similar style. Although Denny (and also founding member, the bass player Ashley Hutchings) quit the band even before the album's release, Fairport Convention has continued to the present day to make music strongly based within the British folk rock idiom, and are still the band most prominently associated with it. The album was moderately successful, peaking at number 17 on the UK Albums Chart during a 15-week run. It is often credited, though the claim is sometimes disputed, as the first major \\"British folk rock\\" album (this term is not to be confused with American-style folk rock, which had first achieved mainstream popularity on both sides of the Atlantic with The Byrds' early work several years prior). The popularity of Liege & Lief did a great deal to establish the new style commercially and artistically as a distinct genre. In an audience vote at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2006, the album was voted \\"Most Influential Folk Album of All Time\\". It was voted number 254 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). History Following the motorway accident that had killed Martin Lamble, the band were left without a drummer. After the release of Unhalfbricking, Dave Mattacks took over the role and, having previously been a drummer at Mecca Ballrooms, had to \\"learn a whole new style of drumming.\\" The virtuoso fiddle and mandolin player Dave Swarbrick, a little older than the rest of the band, had already been in a successful duo with guitarist Martin Carthy. After his appearance on Unhalfbricking, he too joined Fairport full-time. This incarnation of the band, comprising lead vocalist Denny and newcomers Swarbrick and Mattacks, together with founder members Richard Thompson on lead guitar and some vocals, Simon Nicol on rhythm guitar and Ashley Hutchings on electric bass, rehearsed and put together Liege & Lief over the summer of 1969 at a house in Farley Chamberlayne, near Braishfield, Winchester,Hinton & Wall, p. 114 onwards; Houghton, p. 190 onwards; Humphries, 1982, p. 45-46 launching its material with a sold-out concert in London's Royal Festival Hall on 24 September that year. A bootleg/audience recording of that show exists, but in very poor quality.Fairport Convention, Royal Festival Hall, September 24, 1969 (information at rateyourmusic.com) Gone were the covers of songs by Bob Dylan and others, replaced by electrified versions of traditional English folksongs (\\"Reynardine\\", \\"Matty Groves\\", \\"The Deserter\\", \\"Tam Lin\\"), new compositions by band members but with a \\"traditional\\" feel (\\"Come All Ye\\", \\"Farewell, Farewell\\", \\"Crazy Man Michael\\"), and the first of a long line of instrumental medleys of folk dance tunes driven by Dave Swarbrick's violin playing. Much of the traditional material had been found by Hutchings in Cecil Sharp's collection, maintained by the English Folk Dance and Song Society, although Swarbrick has elsewhere claimed credit as the source of the traditional material used.Swarbrick: \\"[...] Most of the songs came from me. 'Matty Groves', 'Tam Lin', 'The Deserter', all that stuff came from my background, and were songs I introduced to them... 'Matty Groves', Sandy and I put the words together from Child. We put it to an American tune, and I supplied the instrumental tune ('Famous Flower of Serving Men') at the end. 'Tam Lin' I wrote the tune for, based on a slip jig... 'Reynardine', I'd done with Bert [i.e. A.L. \\"Bert\\" Lloyd ]. 'The Deserter', I'd done with Luke Kelly.\\" (quoted in Heylin, p. 104-105; however elsewhere (Swarb's Corrections: Fairport by Fairport by Nigel Schofield), Swarbrick states that he has been misquoted, and that did not play the latter song with Kelly, merely had heard Kelly perform the song in 3/4 time). However, in Hutchings, p. 14, Ashley states that \\"... we learned this next song ['The Deserter'] from a faded Victorian broadside [i.e., ballad-sheet] ...\\". Also rehearsed and/or recorded, but omitted from the final album, were versions of The Byrds' \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\", the traditional ballad \\"Sir Patrick Spens\\" with Denny on lead vocals, and \\"The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood\\", a Richard Fari√±a lyric he had set to a traditional Irish melody, the last two of which were to appear in different arrangements on later albums by Fairport Convention and Sandy Denny, respectively. Of the rehearsal sessions at Farley Chamberlayne that led to the album, Hutchings later said: \\"It was a magical time ... and there‚Äôs a lot of magic on that album. There was a special feeling in the house, in the room, and also a lot of hidden magic and weirdness on that album. The past is weird, you know, our ancestors did a lot of weird things\\"; while Thompson said: \\"Nothing resonates like an old song... To sing something beautifully written, and then refined over hundreds of years, that still has meaning and urgency, that still creates vivid pictures in the mind, is a deeply rewarding thing. I think we hoped the band would achieve some mainstream popularity, so that we could bring the tradition a little closer to people's lives.\\"Quoted in Rob Young: Inside Fairport Convention's Liege And Lief: \\"We were on a crusade‚Ä¶\\" - Uncut Magazine The album title is composed of two Middle English words: liege meaning loyal and lief meaning ready. The cover, a gatefold in grey and purple, featured cameo images of the band along with track listing and credits. On the inside of the original gatefold cover, a set of illustrated vignettes told the story of ten different aspects of English traditional music and folklore, including notes on customs such as pace-eggers and the Padstow hobby-horse, as well as collectors such as Francis James Child (of \\"Child Ballads\\" fame) and Cecil Sharp. The band toured the UK for several months, also visiting Denmark, performing the Liege & Lief material before recording it in the studio (also including a performance recorded for BBC radio's Top Gear). However, in November 1969, even before the album was released on 2 December, both Hutchings and Denny quit the band: Hutchings to further pursue traditional music in a new band Steeleye Span, and Denny to form her new venture Fotheringay, with more emphasis on her own original compositions.Houghton, p. 202-204; Hinton & Wall, p. 137-138. Subsequent to these departures, only Hutchings was replaced (by newcomer Dave Pegg) and thus it was a reduced, 5-man version of the band that went on to record their follow-up album, Full House, the next year. In 2007 a double album \\"Liege and Lief Deluxe Edition\\" was released; the second album consisted mainly of BBC radio live performances and two stylistically uncharacteristic outtakes, the standards \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" and \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\". Reception and influence Reunion line-up, August 2007, with guest vocalist Chris While replacing Denny Liege & Lief was promoted by John Peel on his Top Gear radio programme and the album spent fifteen weeks in the UK album chart, reaching number 17. In a contemporary review, John Mendelsohn of Rolling Stone recommended the album only to devotees of \\"quietly arty traditional folk\\" and felt that \\"Deserter\\" is the only \\"arresting\\" song, as \\"not even the originals match up to the group-composed material on previous albums.\\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice was less enthusiastic, writing that because of his \\"anti- folk\\" tastes, he was disappointed with the album's more traditional material after Unhalfbricking. The album has come to be regarded as having a major influence in the development of British folk rock. It was voted the 'most important folk album of all time' by BBC Radio 2 listeners in 2002, and at the 2006 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Liege and Lief won the award for Most influential Folk Album of all time. At the event, the original line-up of Simon Nicol, Richard Thompson, Ashley Hutchings, Dave Swarbrick, Dave Mattacks, with Chris While replacing Sandy Denny, performed Matty Groves. Georgia Lucas, the daughter of Sandy Denny and Trevor Lucas, accepted the award on behalf of her late mother. This commemoration was repeated on 10 August 2007 at Cropredy, when the complete album was performed (see \\"External links\\"). Prior to that occasion, effective reunions of the Liege and Lief lineup had performed at previous Cropredy festivals, for example with Vikki Clayton standing in for Denny to perform \\"The Deserter\\", \\"Tam Lin\\" and \\"Crazy Man Michael\\" at the 25th anniversary concert in 1992, and the same line-up performing \\"Come All Ye\\", \\"Reynardine\\" and \\"Matty Groves\\" at the 1997 30th anniversary concert.Fairport Convention ‚Äì 25th Anniversary Concert (www.discogs.com)Fairport Convention ‚Äì The Cropredy Box (www.discogs.com) In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Mark Deming said of the album that \\"while [it] was the most purely folk-oriented Fairport Convention album to date, it also rocked hard in a thoroughly original and uncompromising way\\". In June 2007, Mojo magazine listed Liege & Lief at number 58 in its list of \\"100 Records that changed the world\\". In his 2010 book on the UK folk-rock music scene \\"Electric Eden\\", author Rob Young devoted 13 pages to the Liege and Lief period and its resulting album, stating that the album \\"retains a coherence and integrity shared by very few British folk-rock records\\" and that in its music, \\"... Fate is exacted; English balladry displays its full menace and mystery; and there's a tentative reflection upon pain and loss, tainted by hard experience\\".Young, p. 261, 262. For Patrick Humphries, on the other hand, writing in 1996, the album is less than 100% successful: \\"Come all Ye\\" sounds \\"rather forced\\", the band's reading of \\"The Deserter\\" is described as \\"pedestrian\\", and \\"Tam Lin\\" is described as \\"leaden\\" and the soloing on it as \\"timid\\"; he does, however, praise \\"Matty Groves\\" as \\"relish[ing] the interplay between Swarbrick and Thompson\\", \\"Reynardine\\" for the quality of Denny's singing, the instrumental medley as giving Swarbrick's fiddle a chance to shine (along with Thompson's and Hutchings' guitar and bass contributions), \\"Crazy Man Michael\\" as \\"a substantial conclusion to the album\\", and \\"Farewell, Farewell\\" as \\"a flawless example of what Fairport were capable of at their peak.\\"Humphries, 1996, p. 89-91 Track listing Tracks 4, 5, 6, and 7 on disc two were recorded live for John Peel's BBC Top Gear show.

Variants Canned tomatoes are available in several different forms. The traditional forms are whole peeled tomatoes, packed in juice or pur√©e, and ground tomatoes, sometimes referred to as \\"kitchen-ready.\\" Ground tomatoes are not to be confused with pur√©e, which is similar but more cooked. Taste tests indicate that whole tomatoes packed in juice tend to be perceived as fresher-tasting than those packed in pur√©e. Crushed tomatoes, commonly used for pasta sauces, are made by adding ground tomatoes to a heavy medium made from tomato paste. Diced tomatoes have become increasingly common for applications where a chunkier or more substantial product is needed. In recent years, the Petite Diced form (3/8\\" cut pieces) has become the fastest growing segment of canned tomatoes. Usage In areas and situations where in-season, perfectly ripe tomatoes are not available, canned tomatoes are often used as an alternative to prepare dishes such as tomato sauce or pizza. The top uses for canned tomatoes are Italian or pasta sauces, chili, soup, pizza, stew, casseroles, and Mexican cuisine. Economic aspects Industrially produced canned tomatoes are an important product and subject to regular market analysis as well as trade considerations. Home preservation Home canned tomatoes may be prepared in a number of ways. However, safety measures need to be taken since improperly canned tomatoes can cause botulism poisoning, whether produced industrially or at home. Diced tomatoes Diced tomatoes usually refers to tomatoes that have been diced. In the United States retail environment, however, the term refers to canned chunks of plum tomatoes in tomato juice or tomato pur√©e, sometimes seasoned with basil or garlic. This product is a relatively recent arrival in the processed tomato market, and has become quite popular since its introduction in the mid-90s, probably due to American tastes for a chunkier tomato sauce. Calcium chloride is sometimes added to stabilize the cell structure of the canned tomatoes, giving the end product a firmer texture. Canned diced tomatoes are primarily used in Italian- American cuisine. They are generally available in two sizes, regular (roughly 2 cm or 7/8 in) for long-cooked dishes and petite (roughly 1 cm) for quicker applications.

However, even it is sometimes subject to the same reduction to that ly has been, mainly if it is at the end of a word.  History  Originally, the digraph letter ly was used to represent the palatal lateral , just as the digraph letter ny is still used to represent the palatal nasal . However, in the eastern dialects as well as in the standard dialect, the phoneme lost its lateral feature and merged with (akin to Spanish ye√≠smo).

It is one of several French films made by Spanish-born filmmaker Luis Bu√±uel. Though highly satirical and reflective of his typical anti-bourgeoisie sentiments, it is one of Bu√±uel's more realistic films, generally avoiding the outlandish surrealist imagery and far-fetched plot twists found in many of his other works. It stars Jeanne Moreau as a chambermaid whose attractiveness is apparent to owners and to servants alike‚Äîher femininity charms some, at the same time it brings out envy (or admiration) in others of the household and among adjacent neighbors. The maid's predicament, in this light, develops her as a character with some autonomy, and with some powers that derive from the narrative context‚Äîwhich is a social setting of corruption, violence, sexual obsession and perversion. Just off the train from Paris, the chambermaid steps into a waiting buggy from the chateau, its driver already eyeing her, with designs that he expresses by remarking on her shoes. This was the first screenwriting collaboration between Bu√±uel and Jean-Claude Carri√®re, which would later produce his well-known Belle de Jour (1967), The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) and That Obscure Object of Desire (1977). The two extensively reworked the 1900 novel of the same name by Octave Mirbeau, that had been given a more literal treatment in its second film adaptation, made in Hollywood in 1946, directed by Jean Renoir. The novel has been adapted for the screen a third time in Beno√Æt Jacquot's 2015 version. Plot A stylish, attractive young woman, C√©lestine (Jeanne Moreau), arrives from Paris to become chambermaid for an odd family at their country chateau. The period is mid-1930s, and the populace is astir with extremist politics, right and left. The Monteil's household consists of a childless couple, the frigid wife's elderly, genteel father, and several servants, including Joseph the groom (Georges G√©ret) who's a rightist, nationalist, anti-Semitic, violent man. The wife (Fran√ßoise Lugagne) runs a rigidly tidy house; she would like to please her virile husband physically, but cannot, due to pelvic \\"pain\\". M. Monteil (Michel Piccoli) amuses himself by hunting small game and pursuing all the females within range--the previous chambermaid seems to have left pregnant and had to be \\"bought off\\". The wife's father amuses himself with his collection of racy postcards and novels, and a closet full of women's shoes and boots, that he likes his chambermaids to model. Their next-door neighbor (Daniel Ivernel) is a burly, retired Army officer, with a chubby maid/mistress (Gilberte G√©niat), and a violent streak of his own--he likes to throw refuse and stones over the fence, to the great annoyance of M. Monteil. To the maid's role, (in this household chiefly determined by sexual proclivities of other characters) C√©lestine adapts quickly, and through her own insight as well as through convivial gossip from kitchen staff, she begins to employ her own female assets conveniently, a practical behavior providing her some security, in her varied domestic relations or encounters. The elderly father, M. Rabour (Jean Ozenne), is found dead in bed, disheveled, clutching some boots that C√©lestine had worn earlier that evening; and C√©lestine decides to leave the job the next day. Previously, however, she had become motherly and protective of a sweet prepubescent girl named Claire (Dominique Sauvage) who visited the house; after the girl's raped and mutilated body is found in a nearby wood, C√©lestine decides to stay on at the job, in order to get revenge on the murderer. She quickly finds reason to suspect the groom Joseph. She seduces and promises to marry him and join him to run a caf√© in Cherbourg, so he will confess the crime to her, which he does not. She then contrives and plants evidence to implicate him in the girl's murder. He is arrested, but eventually released for lack of solid evidence, although there is a suggestion that the real reason is his nativist political activism. Meanwhile, C√©lestine agrees to marry the elderly ex-Army-officer neighbor, and after the marriage, we see him serving her breakfast in bed and obeying her commands. The final scene shows a crowd of nationalistic men marching past the Cherbourg caf√© run by Joseph, who has another woman now and is shouting rightist slogans.

It has had widespread use for languages of West Africa, though in some countries, the IPA letter …≤ is now used. It is sometimes used in modern Spanish where √± cannot be used, such as in earlier computer programming or Internet domain names.FAQ about .es domain names: . N and ny are mentioned as substitutes for √±. Aragonese The writing of the palatal nasal in Aragonese has been a matter of debate since the first orthographic codification of the language (graf√≠a de Uesca) in 1987 by the Consello d'a Fabla Aragonesa at a convention in Huesca. Medieval Aragonese had used several different digraphs, but the two most common spellings used were √± (as in Spanish) or ny (as in Catalan). √ë was the one chosen and has been used in almost all texts of the last decades, but the subject remained controversial, and some writers continued to promote the use of the digraph ny. The use of ny was also proposed in an alternative Aragonese orthography, the graf√≠a SLA devised in 2004 by the Sociedat de Ling√ºistica Aragonesa in 2004. According to the 2010 Orthographic Proposal of the Academia de l'Aragon√©s, created in 2006, the palatal nasal phoneme should be written as ny.Estudio de Filoloch√≠a Aragonesa. Propuesta Ortografica de l'Academia de l'Aragon√©s. Edicions Dichitals de l'Academia de l'Aragon√©s, Zaragoza, 2010.  Catalan  In Catalan, ny is not considered a single letter but a consonantal digraph (n followed by y) to represent . The letter y, in Catalan, is used only to form ny and has no other purpose. It is found in any position in a word: at the beginning (nyap \\"rubbish\\", nyaufar \\"to dent\\"), in intervocalic position (Catalunya \\"Catalonia\\"; canya \\"reed\\", \\"steem\\") and at the end of a word (any \\"year\\", estany \\"lagoon\\", seny \\"sense\\").  Hungarian  Ny is the twenty-third letter of the Hungarian alphabet. Its name is eny (), and it represents the palatal nasal (). Even mere sequences of n and y that represent different sounds are considered instances of this letter; this holds true in acronyms as well. Below are examples of Hungarian words that use the letter ny along with their English translations: *anya = mother *eny√©m = mine *annyi = so much *any√≥s = mother-in-law *eserny≈ë = umbrella *zsiv√°ny = knave Indonesian In Indonesian, ny represents the palatal nasal . Until 1972, this digraph was spelled nj. For example, Spain is called Spanyol (compare with Espa√±a in Spanish). Spanish In Old Spanish scripts, the graph ny was widely used, along with nn and ni, to represent the same palatal sound as Catalan, ; however since standardization it has been replaced with √±. Despite this, ny may be found in modern Spanish where √± is not available, such as in earlier computer programming or Internet domain names. Similarly, ny is also used in Judaeo-Spanish.  Swahili  In Swahili, ny represents the palatal nasal /…≤/. As other consonant sounds, it can only appear at the beginning of a syllable.

He played college football at Auburn University. Early years Edwards attended Abbeville High School. He was a two-way tackle and contributed to the team having a 9-1 record, while outscoring their opponents 281-19 in 1957. He received All-state honors as a senior. He also practiced basketball. College career He accepted football scholarship from Auburn University. Edwards was a two-way player who was used as an offensive end and defensive end. As a junior, he posted 6 receptions (tied for second on the team) for 74 yards and no touchdowns. As a senior, he led the team with 25 receptions for 372 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was named to the All-SEC team. He played in the 1962 Senior Bowl, where Tom Landry coached the opposing team (North). In 1987, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career Edwards was selected by the Denver Broncos in the 25th round (194th overall) of the 1962 AFL Draft, but chose to sign with the NFL's Dallas Cowboys as a free agent in 1962. As a rookie, he started out as an offensive end on the taxi squad and was later converted to outside linebacker. He wasn't activated for any of the 14 games. In 1963, he gained 25 lbs (from 205 to 230) and started 6 games, while replacing the injured Lee Roy Jordan and Harold Hays. In 1964, he began the season as the starter at strongside linebacker, until Chuck Howley passed him on the depth chart in the fourth game. In 1965, he was named the starter at weakside linebacker. He would end up forming with Howley and Jordan, one of the best linebacking corps in NFL history as part of the 'Doomsday Defense'. In 1967, he had 3 interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown against the Baltimore Colts. In 1969, Chuck Howley was moved to strongside linebacker and Edwards to weakside linebacker. Referred to as \\"Fuzzy\\" by his teammates, Edwards' strength made him a difficult player to deal with against the run and he was also known to rarely make mistakes that could hurt the defense. He thrived against opposing tight ends, so much so, that then Oakland Raiders linebackers coach John Madden, instructed his linebackers to study Edwards' technique in stopping the run while jamming the tight end. In 1970, he intercepted two passes against the Cleveland Browns, contributing to a 6-2 win, that was key for the team to make the playoffs. On July 1, 1976, he announced his retirement and was replaced with Bob Breunig. Although overshadowed by Howley and Jordan, he was a key component in the Cowboys' defensive dominance during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cowboys defensive assistant coach Ernie Stautner said \\"The best thing you can say about Edwards is that he's a pro. He plays while he's hurt and he still does an outstanding job. That's what a pro is\\". Edwards missed only one game in his 12 NFL seasons, while starting 135 games. He recorded 30 turnovers, that included 13 interceptions and 16 fumbles recoveries (tied for second in franchise history). He helped the Cowboys win three NFC Championships and one Super Bowl. He played in Super Bowls V, VI and X. Personal life Edwards was a talented painter whose work was displayed in several shows. On December 6, 2016, Edwards died in his sleep the day he was scheduled to undergo tests for a heart condition at a Waco hospital. Edwards' son, Chris, planned on burying both of his parents' ashes together. However, his house was robbed on March 20, 2017, and his mother Gail's ashes were taken by the burglar.

Gwynne was also one of the most popular pin-ups of World War II. She is the grandmother of actor Chris Pine. Career Gwynne was born in Waco, Texas, the daughter of Pearl (n√©e Guinn) and Jefferson Benjamin Trice, an apparel manufacturer. After her family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, she attended Stephens College, where she studied drama. While accompanying her father to a convention in Los Angeles, Gwynne obtained a job modeling for Catalina Swimwear. She soon began acting in small theaters and appeared in a newsreel and a charity short. In June 1939, she signed a contract with Universal and was immediately put to work in Unexpected Father. Universal cast her in a variety of genres including film noir and musical comedy. She made a number of Westerns at the studio, including two she numbered among her favorite projects; Men of Texas with Robert Stack and Broderick Crawford and Ride 'Em Cowboy with Abbott and Costello (both 1942). She is remembered by fans of horror for her work in several pictures made in the 1940s. Her first horror film was Black Friday (1940) in which she played Boris Karloff's daughter. House of Frankenstein (1944) was the last horror picture she did at Universal. Gwynne was a television pioneer, appearing in TV's first filmed series, Public Prosecutor (1947‚Äì48); she was a member of the regular cast, playing Pat Kelly, the district attorney's secretary.

It serves as a bridge between input methods and the operating system. It was originally designed to offer a better text-entry experience and alternative input methods not found in Apple's built-in set or suit better the needs for Windows \\"switchers.\\" However, the developers have since worked on a Microsoft Windows port and a bridge between OV and SCIM on the X Window System. The macOS version is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger). OV's input methods can also be used through SCIM on Linux or FreeBSD. An experimental Win32 Unicode version is also available. History and development The motivation for OpenVanilla was for to fill an oversight in commercially available software. Apple was slow to localize its operating system for the Chinese market. In 1987, three years after launching Macintosh, Apple produced a Chinese version of its Finder (then the improper name of its later renamed \\"Mac OS\\"), Chinese Talk. There were several competing alternatives, but these never gained traction. However, Apple's Chinese Talk and later its Chinese version of Mac OS had a serious shortcoming: although several Chinese input methods were offered, one of them ‚Äî the Phonetic \\"Zhuyin\\" method ‚Äî lacked the Eten Layout, which more closely emulates Chinese phonetics. In the mid-1980s, prior to the globalization of computing and software distribution, new computer users learned the Eten Layout as their first (and often only) way of transcribing Chinese characters. Without support for the Eten Layout on the Apple OS, Microsoft maintained a substantial customer base, especially in Taiwan, because the phonetic method in Windows included the Eten Layout as an optional configuration. Apple's Mac OS X, launched in 2002, received negative feedback after another popular input method, Cangjie, was substantially modified, prompting complaints that the method in OS X was too unfamiliar, compared to that of OS 9. In 2003, developer clkao (Chia-liang Kao) ported Chewing, a popular Chinese input method in Linux/FreeBSD world, to OS X. Using Xcode, a development tool included with OS X, it became possible to build customized input methods on OS X. clkao's port is called ChewingOSX and was transferred to gugod (Kang-ming Liu) and zonble (Weizhong Yang) in 2004 for further maintenance. The success of these developers inspired another, lukhnos, to create VanillaInput, a phonetic input method that supports the Eten Layout, in July 2004. A month later, Cangjie support was also added, overcoming the perceived challenges of OS X. Prior to these advancements, the focus of large OS producers, such as Apple, did not generally include input method support for minority languages. As a repercussion of the developments surrounding Chewing and VanillaInput, the design of new Chinese input methods was opened for further exploration. Yet, regarding the writing of an IM, many parts (libraries, for example) were still not \\"open\\" source. In October 2004, lukhnos, gugod, zonble and b6s began to develop a new IM framework, OpenVanilla, designed on Mac OS X, but intended for implementation beyond OS X. The intention was to create a minimalist and clean design with the goal of helping users write their own IM with minimal C++ knowledge, and independent of the operating platform. =Holo and POJ input method= Holo is an example of a language that can be aided by OpenVanilla. Holo is a language spoken by more than approximately 70% of the Taiwanese population. It is the de facto majority language (even though 95% of the people speak and read Mandarin, the official language, to varying competence and extent), but it lacks the same social standing as Mandarin. One contributing factor to this inequality is that it is not used in information processing, because a proper, fully functioning input method for it was not offered by major OS publishers. A foundation upon which to build an input method for Holo exists. POJ (PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´) is the de facto romanization standard for the Holo language spoken in Taiwan. In use for over 150 years, POJ was used to publish a Holo Bible and many other important texts. In addition, the transcription of Holo shares similarities with Japanese: the written language can be represented in various ways (in syllabic forms or in ideographic forms). Holo can be written in either Romanized form (PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´) or in Chinese/Han characters. A standard IME for Japanese exists, in which text is entered phonetically, and then converted by the IME to be presented in various final forms: hiragana, katakana, kanji, or romaji. Conceivably, an analogous system could be developed for Holo using the same principles. Demo movie This screenshot demonstrates the different \\"layers\\" of a functional POJ input method. A better Holo input method should evolve further into the \\"phrase\\" layer, in which phrases could be automatically interpreted, and users would not be required to explicitly assign tones for each syllable. Future OpenVanilla is still in its nascent stage. Currently a preliminary implementation is done using rapid prototyping techniques and Objective-C++. To make it platform-independent and more accommodating, it needs to re- implemented. Aside from the Objective-C part that pertains mostly to data structure, OpenVanilla's POJ IM module is a pure algorithm code that deals exclusively with keyboard mapping and syllable transformation without a user interface code, so as not to require an IM developer to possess in-depth knowledge of its inner workings.

The title role of Gertrud Kanning is played by Nina Pens Rode, with Bendt Rothe as her husband, Gustav Kanning, and Baard Owe as her lover, Erland Jansson. Gertrud was Dreyer's final film. It is notable for its many long takes, one of which is a nearly ten-minute take of Gertrud and her ex-lover, Gabriel, talking about their pasts. The film opened to divided responses but is now considered one of Dreyer's major works. Plot Gertrud, a former opera singer in Stockholm in the early 20th century, is married to the lawyer and politician Gustav Kanning. Gertrud tells her husband that he has become more in love with his career and status than with her. She also tells him that she has met another man who loves her more than anything else, and that she therefore prefers him to her husband and wants a divorce. Gertrud meets her lover, the promising young pianist Erland Jansson, in a park. The two go to Jansson's house. Gertrud tells him how devoted she is to him. In the evening Gustav goes to pick Gertrud up at the opera where she had said she would be, but can't find her. The next evening the Kannings attend a dinner party at the house of the poet Gabriel Lidman, with whom Gertrud has had a relationship in the past. Gertrud greets her friend Axel Nygren who attends the same party. Gustav confronts Gertrud about the opera, and demands one last night with her before the separation. Lidman tells Gertrud that he had met Jansson at a party where he had bragged about Gertrud as his latest conquest. When Gertrud meets with Jansson the next day she tells him that she wants to go away with him and leave everything else behind. He tells her that he cannot, because he is expecting a child with another woman. Lidman makes an attempt to persuade Gertrud to leave with him instead, but without success; when Lidman and Gertrud were a couple, just like Kanning, he had valued his career above her. Kanning makes a last attempt to persuade Gertrud to stay with him, even allowing her to keep her lover at the same time. The attempt fails and Gertrud moves alone to Paris to study psychology. Thirty years later, Gertrud, together with Nygren, looks back at her life. She says that love is the only thing that means anything in life. She is now alone because of her refusal to compromise on that position, but does not regret anything.

In the nine-year period between films he had attempted to make films based on Euripides' Medea, William Faulkner's Light in August, and wrote treatments based on Henrik Ibsen's Brand, August Strindberg's Damascus and Eugene O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra. He also worked on his long planned but never realized film about the life of Christ.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. p. 272 According to Carl Theodor Dreyer, he had considered adapting two Hjalmar S√∂derberg works in the 1940s, the 1905 novel Doctor Glas and the 1906 play Gertrud. None of the projects were realised at the time. The Gertrud project was revived when Dreyer read a 1962 monograph by Sten Rein called Hjalmar S√∂derbergs Gertrud, which pointed out the original play's use of dialogue: how the story often is driven by trivial conversations and failures to communicate. This inspired Dreyer to make a film where speech is more important than images. Adapting the play into a screenplay, Dreyer chose to abridge the third act and added an epilogue.Milne, Tom. The Cinema of Carl Dreyer. New York: A. S. Barnes & Co.. 1971. SBN 498-07711-X. p. 175. The epilogue was inspired by the life of Maria von Platen, S√∂derberg's original inspiration for the Gertrud character. The film was produced by Palladium, and filmed at Nordisk Film's studios in Valby, since Palladium's own studios were used by Danmarks Radio for a television production. Exterior scenes were filmed in the Vall√∏ Castle park. Filming took three months, and editing three days. The film was mostly made up of long takes of shots of two or more actors talking to each other and continued Dreyer's devotion to the principles of kammerspiel. Over the years, Dreyer's filming style had become more and more subdued and compared to the fast cutting in The Passion of Joan of Arc or the tracking shots in Vampyr, this film contained slowed down camera shots with restricted angles and an increased length of single takes.Wakeman. p. 272. Reception The film premiered at Le Studio M√©dicis in Paris on 18 December 1964. The cinema equipment failed several times during the screening, the subtitles were of low quality and the reels were shown in the wrong order, prompting extremely negative reactions from the audience. It was released in Denmark on 1 January 1965 through Film-Centralen-Palladium. It was later screened at the Cannes Film festival, where it was booed.Wakeman. p. 272 It was later screened to a packed house at the 1965 Venice Film Festival, but more than half of the audience walked out during the film. Those who remained gave the film a standing ovation, causing Dreyer to become visibly moved.Milne. p. 9. =Critical response= From the outset the film divided both critics and audiences. Immediately following the Paris premiere at a Dreyer retrospective where it was booed the film was frequently referred to as a \\"disaster\\" in the press; after the Danish premiere the reception became more nuanced but still divided, and the film caused a big debate in Danish media. A critic wrote in Variety in 1965: \\"Theme, with echoes of Ibsen, in its social haranguing for female independence, and Strindberg, in its difficulty in male and female understanding, lends itself admirably to Dreyer's dry but penetrating style. Nina Pens Rode has the right luminous quality for the romantic, uncompromising Gertrud, while the men are acceptable if sometimes overindulgent in their roles.\\" In Esquire Magazine, Dwight Macdonald wrote that \\"Gertrud is a further reach, beyond mannerism into cinematic poverty and straightforward tedium. He just sets up his camera and photographs people talking to each other.\\" An article in Cin√©ma65 wrote that \\"Dreyer has gone from serenity to senility...Not a film, but a two-hour study of sofas and pianos.\\" In defense of Gertrud, Dreyer stated that \\"What I seek in my films...is a penetration to my actors' profound thoughts by means of their most subtle expressions...This is what interests me above all, not the technique of cinema. Gertrud is a film that I made with my heart.\\" Jean-Luc Godard rated the film number one in his list of the best films of 1964. As well, Cahiers du cin√©ma voted it the second-best of 1964, beaten only by Godard's own film, Band of Outsiders. Andrew Sarris rated it the second-best of 1966, only beaten by Blowup. Tom Milne called it \\"the kind of majestic, necromantic masterpiece that few artists achieve even once in a lifetime.\\" Penelope Houston called it \\"an enigmatically modern film with the deceptive air of a staidly old fashioned one... This is a kind of distillation, at once contemplative and compulsive.\\" Jean S√©molu√© said that \\"Of all Dreyer's works, it is the most inward and thus the culmination, if not the crown, of his aesthetic.\\" In the 2012 edition of Sight & Sound's poll of film critics, conducted every ten years to gauge critical opinion about the greatest films of all-time, Gertrud tied for 43rd place. =Accolades= The film won the FIPRESCI prize at the 1965 Venice Film Festival and the Prix du comit√© directeur at the 7th Festival des Cin√©-Rencontres in Prades. It received the 1965 Bodil Award for Best Danish Film. The film was selected as the Danish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 38th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences See also * 1964 in film * Cinema of Denmark * List of submissions to the 38th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Danish submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film References =Bibliography= * External links Gertrud an essay by Phillip Lopate at the Criterion Collection Category:1964 drama films Category:1964 films Category:Danish black-and-white films Category:Danish drama films Category:Danish films Category:Danish-language films Category:Danish films based on plays Category:Films directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer Category:Films set in Sweden Category:Films shot in Denmark Category:Adultery in films Category:Films about psychiatry ","title":"Gertrud (film)"},{"id":"3644786","text":"'''''' The men's 10,000 metres was the longest of the seven men's track races in the Athletics at the 1964 Summer Olympics program in Tokyo. It was held on 14 October. 38 athletes from 23 nations entered, with 6 more not starting the event. The event was held as a single heat. Results =Final= World record holder Ron Clarke set the tone of the race. His tactic of surging every other lap appeared to be working. Halfway through the race, only five runners were still with Clarke: Mohammed Gammoudi of Tunisia, Mamo Wolde of Ethiopia, Barry Magee of New Zealand, Kokichi Tsuburaya of Japan, and Billy Mills of the United States. Magee and Tsuburaya, the local favorite, lost contact first, then Wolde. With two laps to go, only two runners were still with Clarke. On paper, it seemed to be Clarke's race. He had run a world record time of 28:15.6 while neither Gammoudi nor Mills had ever run under 29 minutes. Mills and Clarke were running together with Gammoudi right behind as they entered the final lap. They were lapping other runners and, down the backstretch, Clarke was boxed in. He pushed Mills once, then again. Then Gammoudi pushed his way between them both and surged into the lead as they rounded the final curve. Clarke recovered and began chasing Gammoudi while Mills appeared to be too far back to be in contention. Clarke failed to catch Gammoudi, but Mills pulled out to lane 4 and sprinted past them both. His winning time of 28:24.4 was almost 50 seconds faster than he had run before and set a new Olympic record for the event. No American had ever before won the 10,000 m, nor has any other American come seriously close until Galen Rupp took the silver at the 2012 London Olympics.

It was published in 2005. It divides into two main storylines that follow two protagonists, Ala√Øs (from the year 1209) and Alice (in the year 2005). The two stories occur in a shared geography and intertwine. The novel relies heavily on historical events such as the massacre at B√©ziers and the Crusade against the Cathars in Occitania, now the South of France, from around 1200. The text itself features many Occitan and French quotes. Ultimately the story becomes a quest for the Holy Grail. In the 2006 British Book Awards, Labyrinth was awarded Best Read of the Year. According to The Sunday Times, it was the second best selling book in the United Kingdom in 2006, after The Da Vinci Code, selling about 865,400 copies in paperback. The Guardian ranked it the number one bestseller for 2006. An extract from the novel was used in the Scottish Qualifications Authority's 2009 Standard Grade English General close reading paper.  Plot  When Dr Alice Tanner, who works as a volunteer at the archaeological site of Pic de Soularac, in France, discovers two skeletons in a long-hidden cave in the hillside, she unearths a link with an horrific and brutal past. However, it is not just the sight of the shattered bones that makes her uneasy there is an overwhelming sense of evil in the tomb that Alice finds hard to shake off, even in the bright French sunshine. Puzzled by the words carved inside the chamber and the representation of a labyrinth, she finds an exact representation of it on the underside of the ring she found in the cave. Alice has an uneasy feeling that she has disturbed something that was meant to remain hidden. She finds a connection between her nightmares she had been having since childhood and discovers that the cave was related to her past. Eight hundred years ago, on the night before a brutal civil war ripped apart Languedoc, three books were entrusted to Ala√Øs, a young herbalist and healer, the daughter of the steward of Carcassona. Although she cannot understand the symbols and diagrams the books contain, Ala√Øs knows her destiny lies in protecting their secret at all costs. The book contains the secrets to the Holy Grail. Alice later discovers that she is Ala√Øs's descendant.  Television adaptation  A television adaptation of the novel adapted by Adrian Hodges and directed by Christopher Smith was released in 2012.

It is an adaptation of Jos√© Giovanni's 1957 book The Break. It was called The Night Watch when first released in the United States, but is released under its French title today. The film is based on a true event concerning five prison inmates in La Sant√© Prison in France in 1947. Director Becker, who died just weeks after shooting had wrapped, used mostly non-actors for the film's main roles, including one man (Jean Keraudy) who was actually involved in the 1947 escape attempt, and who introduces the film.Darragh O‚ÄôDonoghue \\"Le Trou\\", senses of cinema website. It was entered into the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Gaspard, a very polite prisoner, is moved to a cell (block 11, cell 6) designed for, and containing, four inmates due to repair works in his block. The cellmates keep busy making cardboard boxes. Gaspard receives a food parcel from his mistress and has to watch while the guard chops up the sausages and prods the jams, searching for concealed tools. The four existing cellmates expect long prison sentences, ranging from 10 years to possibly execution by guillotine, and have a pre-existing plan to escape. Gaspard himself is accused of the attempted murder of his wife, and faces a potential 20 year sentence. Gaspard shares his food parcel with the four and gains their confidence sufficiently for them to reveal their escape plan: digging a hole through the floor to reach the underground passages. The bulk of the film then focuses upon their gradual progress, which results in two men reaching an outer manhole in the public street outside the prison walls. However, the two do not escape, and instead return to the cell to organise the timing of the group escape. Geo decides not to join. But, just as they are ready to go, Gaspard gets called to a meeting with the governor, and is told his wife has withdrawn the charges; and that he will be released soon. Returning to the cell, Gaspard has to dispel the suspicions of his cellmates, that he had turned them in. However, in the last moments before the four are about to leave through their tunnel, a group of guards appears outside and they realise that they have been betrayed. A fight ensues in the cell and the guards intervene. As Gaspard is returned to his original cell, the original four have been stripped to their underwear (before going into solitary confinement). But Gaspard too has been cheated, as the governor has a reputation for swapping information for supposed release rumours. Whether or not his wife has dropped the charges the state still wishes to prosecute.

Years later, he found out that Jos√© Giovanni had fictionalized the same escape attempt in his 1957 novel The Break. Becker contacted Giovanni's publisher, Gallimard, and Becker and Giovanni collaborated on the screenplay of Le Trou. During production, Becker hired three of the attempted escapees as technical consultants. One of the consultants, Roland Barbat (using the stage name Jean Keraudy), appears in the film as the character Roland Darbant, who plans the escape tunnel and improvises all the tools they use.Le Trou.

When Magik goes to confront Pixie, Alani jumps to attack her, but Magik blasts her to the ground with her powers. She participated in the final fight against Belasco, and afterwards returned to the school with the rest of the students.

Loa, along with fellow students Mercury and Onyxx, was tasked with keeping peace at the riots on Telegraph Hill after the mutant-hate group \\"Humanity Now!\\" marched from Sacramento to San Francisco to promote \\"Proposition X,\\" displeasing many citizens of San Francisco, mutant and non-mutant alike.Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1 =Nation X= Whilst living on the island of Utopia, Magneto accompanies Anole, Loa and Rockslide as they search for Mercury, who claim has been captured by a ghost in the tunnels. They find Mercury, and Magneto deals with the ghost - a hologram recording of himself when he was younger. Loa is also a victim of the Stepford Cuckoos boredom as they trap her in a psychic illusion where she is hanging on to an edge of a cliff, where her fingers are 'tap danced' on until she plunges off a cliff into the churning waters of the cold Pacific. Later Loa teams up with Match and Rockside to steal some food from Warpath, who is on guard duty. After Warpath takes out Rockslide and Match, Loa puts him in his place by declaring ‚ÄòI came here for ice cream. I‚Äôll leave when I get it‚Äô as well as threatening to dissolve Warpath's chest. Warpath realizes she isn't bluffing until Rockslide points out Warpath has been sneaking food as he had food in his mouth throughout the whole ordeal. =Necrosha= During the attack of Selene's undead force on Utopia, Alani was attacked by three reanimated Acolytes: Cortez, Mellencamp, and Delgado. She was saved by Deadpool, who was in her room playing with her toys and reading her diary when he heard her screams. Discovering that the former Acolytes would revive and reform after any injury, Deadpool spent 20 minutes \\"subduing them with lethal force\\" until he ran out of bullets. Finally, he was about to be eviscerated by Mellencamp, when Loa dove through the reanimated mutant, disintegrating him in the process. Seeing that Mellencamp did not reform, Deadpool threw Loa at the remaining Acolytes, forcing her to disintegrate them as well.X-Force vol. 3 Annual #1 =Collision= Loa joins Rogue, Magneto, Indra and Anole on a trip to Mumbai due to Indra's family summoning him home.

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Loa demonstrates her power Loa possesses a molecular distortion power that allows her to move through solid matter by disabling binding forces. This causes the matter to crumble, or break down around as she passes through it. The markings on her body are physical signs of her mutation, and not tattoos. Loa is very reluctant to use her powers unless absolutely necessary. This stems from the destructive nature of her powers and past experiences.X-Force v3 Annual #1 Despite having very little field experience and never being sent on any X-Men missions, Loa has proven herself capable in battle, surviving the Purifiers assault on the Xavier Institute, defending herself against demons when sucked into Limbo, combating the reanimated dead during Necrosha alongside Deadpool, holding her own against Nimrod Sentinels, and single- handedly defeating a full-sized Sentinel in combat. She wears an Atlantean pendant that keeps her alive underwater.

The texture is slightly rough, and the surface is unfinished. Due to the source material, mainly wood pulp, small particles are visible on the paper's surface. It is used for projects or crafts. Some construction paper colors The origin of the term \\"sugar paper\\" lies in its use for making bags to contain sugar. It is related to the \\"blue paper\\" used by confectionery bakers from the 17th century England onwards; for example, in the baking of Regency ratafia cakes (or macaroons). The animated television series Blue's Clues and South Park (initially) were made using construction paper and stop motion. History The term construction paper was associated with the material in the early 20th century, although the general process for creating the paper began in the late 19th century when industrialized paper production and synthetic dye technology were combined. Around that time, construction paper was primarily advertised for classroom settings as an effective canvas for supporting multiple drawing media. The process for creating the paper involved a machine oriented process that exposed the paper to dyes while it was still pulp, resulting in a thorough distribution and brilliance of colour. The primary dyes involved in producing construction paper were abundant until Germany, the main producer of aniline for dyes at the time, became involved in World War I and ceased its exports. The shortage marked a period in which construction paper was created using substitute colouring methods. Construction Paper: A Brief History of Impermanence Dyeing One of the defining features of construction paper is the radiance of its colours. Before the methodology behind construction paper's colouring was introduced, most paper was coloured by pigments and vegetable oil, which had weaker staining capabilities. Synthetic dyes were later developed, which provided a wider range of colours, stronger dyeing strength, and had lower costs. However, the colours given by synthetic dyes tend to fade over short periods of time, an effect often seen in construction paper, noted by greying colours and brittleness.

History =Early years= The Jacobs Aircraft Engine Company was formed in 1926 in Philadelphia. Later the company moved to Pottstown, Pennsylvania after purchasing the machine workshop of the Light Manufacturing and Foundry Company. =Early engines= A Cessna Bobcat displayed with a Jacobs L-4 (R-755) engine, Pima Air & Space Museum, 2013 An early product was the 1931 L-3, a three-cylinder air-cooled radial engine. Only 44 were built. By 1933, Jacobs had developed its most famous engine, the L-4 seven-cylinder air-cooled radial, with a power rating of displacement of . It was better known as by its military designation, R-755. At the time it became known as the best producer of engines in the 200-400 horsepower range. Jacobs was the first to start making engines using forged aluminum alloy pistons, sodium-filled exhaust valves, and magnesium alloy crankcases. The L-4 was used mostly on the Cessna Bobcat, Cessna 195, and Stearman Kaydet. Due to the tendency of the L-4 engine to vibrate heavily at low rpm, it was given the nicknames Shakin' Jake and Shakey Jake. =Later models= Later developments included the 285 hp L-5 or R-830, and 330 hp L-6 or R-915. =Postwar= Jacobs was acquired by Republic Industries in 1945, which was in turn acquired by Barium Steel Corporation in 1946. However in 1947, the company was sold back to Albert Jacobs. Jacobs Aircraft Engines went into default in 1950 and was again sold back to Republic. Finally, Barium sold the company in December 1956 and it closed a few months later in 1957. Applications A Pratt & Whitney R-985 engine, produced by Jacobs during World War 2 Jacobs engines were fitted to many US-built aircraft of the inter- war period, including several Waco models. They were in use in 26 different countries including in Canada, where 330 horsepower L6-MB engines were used to power the Royal Canadian Air Force's Avro Anson Mk. II aircraft. In 1941 the American War Department gave the contract to Jacobs to produce Pratt & Whitney R-985 and R-1340 engines until 1945. Jacobs ranked 87th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M.

The Ukrainian name derives from nad‚Äë (prefix: ‚Äúabove, over‚Äù) + Dnipr√≥ (\\"Dnieper\\") + ‚Äëshchyna (suffix denoting a geographic region). The term Dnieper Ukraine appeared soon after the partitions of Poland when Ukraine as former territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided between the Russian Empire and Austrian Empire and was referred to the Russian controlled Ukraine.

He was selected in the fifth round of the 1966 NFL Draft (79th overall). He played college football at Oklahoma State University. Early years Born in Denton, Texas, Garrison attended nearby Lewisville High School. He played as a linebacker in football. He also played basketball and baseball. Garrison accepted a football scholarship from Oklahoma State University, with the intention of playing defense as a linebacker. In 1963, even though he didn't play the position in high school, Phil Cutchin became the new head coach and moved him to running back in the spring. He was a backup player, finishing his sophomore season with 387 rushing yards, only 12 yards behind the team's leader George Thomas Jr. He also tied for 10th in the Big Eight Conference in rushing yards. As a junior in 1964, he led the Big Eight Conference in rushing with 730 yards, ahead of Jim Grisham and Gale Sayers. He also had 5 rushing touchdowns and 83 receiving yards. Garrison completed his senior season with 924 rushing yards, 107 receiving yards, and 5 touchdowns. He ranked second in rushing yards in the Big Eight Conference behind Charlie Brown. He had 121 rushing yards against the undefeated University of Nebraska. He rushed for 173 yards against Kansas State University. He helped the Cowboys' to their first win over Oklahoma in 20 years. His post-season highlights included appearances in the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game in San Francisco, the Senior Bowl (voted the Outstanding Back of the North team), the Coaches All-America Game in Atlanta and the College All-Star Game against the Green Bay Packers in August 1966. In 1993, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was inducted into the Oklahoma State Athletics Hall of Honor. Professional career Garrison was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round (79th overall) of the 1966 NFL Draft. He was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 17th round (151st overall) of the 1966 AFL Draft. In his first 2 seasons, he was mainly used as a kickoff returner. In 1968, he tallied 45 carries for 271 yards and 5 touchdowns as a backup player. In 1969, he took over at fullback after the retirement of Don Perkins, posting a career-high 818 rushing yards, while scoring 2 touchdowns and forming one of the league's best running back duos with Calvin Hill. In 1970, with the arrival of rookie Duane Thomas, he tallied 126 carries for 507 yards and 3 touchdowns. His style of play and perceived ability to play hurt brought him recognition in Cowboys lore, which included playing the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers with a cracked collarbone and a serious ankle injury, but still managing to record 17 carries for 71 yards, 3 receptions for 51 yards and one touchdown. It was reported in the media, that the trainers needed 36 yards of tape to get him ready to play in Super Bowl V. During Dallas' championship season of 1971, he showed his pass-catching skills, leading the team with 40 receptions. That year, the Cowboys rode their three running backs all the way to a Super Bowl VI victory. In 1972, Garrison was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated for its pro football preview issue; the photo was from Super Bowl VI in January. During the season, he suffered a 16-stitch cut in one of his fingers while doing his favorite hobby (whittling). He was named to the Pro Bowl, after registering 784 yards and 7 touchdowns, even though he was a part of a three-headed rushing attack. He played in the Pro Bowl a few days after suffering a gash in his face while steer wrestling. In 1973, he suffered pinched nerves in his neck during training camp and had headaches so severe that he couldn't sleep. Robert Newhouse was promoted as the starting fullback, performing well enough that it was the sixth game of the season before Garrison could get his starting position back. He still had 105 carries for 440 yards (second on the team) and was third in receiving with 26 receptions. He missed the season finale with a cracked collarbone, but was back in the lineup the next week in the playoffs. A \\"real\\" cowboy, he spent time on the professional rodeo circuit during the football off-seasons. His signing bonus with the Cowboys in 1966 included a horse trailer. In June 1975, Garrison made an appearance at the College National Rodeo Finals in Bozeman, Montana; a knee injury he sustained in an exhibition steer wrestling accident ended his pro football career. He retired in August 1975, and was replaced in the starting lineup with Newhouse. Garrison played in the NFL for nine seasons (missing only 7 games), all of them with the Cowboys. He finished his career with 3,886 yards rushing and 1,794 yards receiving. Garrison retired as the third leading rusher and fourth-leading receiver in team history. One of the more humorous sports quotes was attributed to Cowboy quarterback Don Meredith speaking about Garrison's dependability, \\"If it was third down, and you needed four yards, if you'd get the ball to Walt Garrison, he'd get you five. And if it was third down and you needed twenty yards, if you'd get the ball to Walt Garrison, by God, he'd get you five.\\" Garrison was named to the Dallas Cowboys' 25th anniversary team and was also inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. Personal life He was a long-time spokesman for Skoal smokeless tobacco, and is the current television spokesman for Bill Utter Ford near Denton, Texas. In 1988, he published his biography \\"Once a Cowboy\\" with writer John Tullius. The title is a reference not only to his rodeo cowboy career, but also to his career with the Dallas Cowboys, and his college career with the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Garrison served military duty in New Jersey and Fort Lewis. He established the Walt Garrison Multiple Sclerosis Foundation and currently resides in Argyle, Texas.

Version A There are actually several versions of the Pictish Chronicle. The so-called \\"A\\" text is probably the oldest, the fullest, and seems to have fewer errors than other versions. The original (albeit lost) manuscript seems to date from the early years of the reign of Kenneth II of Scotland (who ruled Scotland from 971 until 995) since he is the last king mentioned and the chronicler does not know the length of his reign. This chronicle survives only in the 14th century Poppleton Manuscript. It is in three parts: # Cronica de origine antiquorum Pictorum, an account of the origins of the Picts, mostly from the Etymologies of Isidore of Seville. # A list of Pictish kings. # Chronicle of the Kings of Alba. It is evident that the latter two sections were originally written in Gaelic since a few Gaelic words have not been translated into Latin. Version D By the 12th century, Giric had acquired legendary status as liberator of the Scottish church from Pictish oppression and, fantastically, as conqueror of Ireland and most of England. As a result, Giric was known as Gregory the Great (Giric's conquests appear as Bernicia, rather than Ireland (Hibernia), in some versions). This tale appears in the variant of the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba which is interpolated in Andrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland. This says that √Åed reigned one year and was killed by his successor Giric in Strathallan (Other king lists have the same report). Here Giric, or Grig, is named \\"Makdougall\\", son of D√∫ngal. List \\"D\\", which may be taken as typical, contains this account of Giric: > Giric, Dungal's son, reigned for twelve years; and he died in Dundurn, and > was buried in Iona.

Anderson, Early Sources, p. 368. The Latin material interpolated in Andrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale Cronykl states that King Dub was murdered at Forres, and links this to an eclipse of the sun which can be dated to 20 July 966.

Early years and education  Adeane was born in 1939 into a prominent family, the son of Michael Adeane (created a life peer as Baron Adeane in 1972) and Helen Chetwynd-Stapylton, the daughter of Richard Chetwynd-Stapylton. The family had a long history of service to the royal family. His maternal great-grandfather was Arthur Bigge, later Lord Stamfordham, private secretary to Queen Victoria and King George V. His paternal great-grandfather was Admiral Edward Stanley Adeane. Edward was educated at Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he graduated with an MA. He was a Page of Honour to The Queen from 1954 to 1956.thePeerage.com ‚Äì Person page 14133  Career  In 1960 and 1961 he was a Plebiscite Supervisor in the Southern Cameroon. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in July 1962, and specialised in libel until 1979. As a barrister, he defended Time Out magazine, owned by Playboy Publications, Inc., in 1973, when they had accused Fiona Lewis, an actress, of being involved with South American revolutionaries. She was awarded damages. The following year, he represented The Spectator magazine who had libelled publishers Jonathan Cape, suggesting they were in financial difficulties, and won a similar outcome in that case. In 1975 he was more successful in representing Marcia, Lady Falkender, who was falsely accused of forging the signature of her boss, former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. She was paid damages and costs. In 1977, Adeane represented Marlene Dietrich in a libel case brought by producer Alexander Cohen for breach of contract, as a disreputable performer.Wilmington Morning Star, quoting British press reports, 22 April 1977 Adeane was appointed Private Secretary and Treasurer to the Prince of Wales in May 1979 to succeed David Checketts.

They were members of the Houghton Fishing Club, where Adeane continued to fish right up until his last days. On the engagement of Lady Diana Spencer and the Prince, she was due to arrive at Albany House, where Adeane had a barrister's set. The staff expected octogenarian Lady Diana Cooper, but were bemused to find a much younger lady arrive in her Mini Metro and park perfectly. Princess Diana had a nervous start in a royal household, where she dismissed almost all of the staff. Adeane was made the Princess's Treasurer in 1981 on their marriage. Adeane was granted the additional appointment as private secretary to the Princess in 1984, following Oliver Everett's resignation. The alleged trouble started during the 1983 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, when the Princess first expressed concern at leaving her children behind in London.Ocala Star Banner, Sat 12 January 1985 citing Daily Express The Daily Mirror reported her calling Adeane a \\"fuddy-duddy\\".Sportsman Review, Spokane, WA, USA, citing Daily Mirror (11 January 1985), p.14 When Adeane tried to plan a tour of Australia in 1984, he was accused of trying to manipulate State elections in Victoria for political purposes.

An almost unprecedented state of affairs materialised on 19 March 1985, when the press were invited into Buckingham Palace to discuss relations.Eagle, 5 May 1985, Parade Magazine, p.18 Evidently the last straw for Adeane he resigned on 31 March 1985.

In cooperation with the French Navy, he commanded British naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea during the First World War. Early life Carden was born in Barnane near Templemore in County Tipperary, Ireland, the third son of Andrew Carden and Anne Berkeley.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition, accessed 25 Aug 2007 Although both his father and grandfather had served in the British Army, he elected for a naval career and joined the Royal Navy in 1870. Military career Carden's early career was marked by service in Egypt and the Sudan and later, under Harry Rawson, in the Benin Expedition of 1897. He was promoted to captain in December 1899, and in May 1901 was commissioned in command of , seagoing tender to the Wildfire, flagship at Sheerness. He was on 16 October 1902 appointed in command of the battleship HMS Magnificent, serving as flagship to rear-admiral Assheton Curzon-Howe, second in command of the Channel Squadron, and took her to visit Gibraltar and Tetuan the following week. In 1908, he was promoted rear admiral. After two years on half-pay, he was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, and raised his flag aboard for one year. Following his return to London, he was posted to the Admiralty until August 1912, at which point he was appointed Admiral Superintendent of Malta Dockyard. In September 1914, he was appointed Commander of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron operating in the Mediterranean,Biography of Sackville Carden at First World War.com under the leadership of a French admiral. Following the Ottoman Empire's entry into the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914, Carden was asked by the British Admiralty to develop a strategy to force open the Dardanelles (Canakkale Bogazi) in January of the following year. Carden's plan called for the systematic destruction of Turkish fortifications along the Dardanelles while advancing slowly up the strait, in addition to extensive minesweeping operations. Initially commander-in-chief of British naval forces during the Dardanelles campaign, Carden was successful in early offensives against Turkish defences from 19 February until early March, when he was relieved of command owing to his failing health,Nervous breakdown ‚Äì Magnus, Philip, Kitchener: Portrait of an Imperialist p.326, John Murray Publishers Ltd (1958) and was replaced by Admiral John de Robeck. Resigning from the Royal Navy two years later with the rank of admiral, Carden lived in retirement until his death in 1930. Notes References *Callwell, C. E., The Dardanelles.

Written and directed by Benjamin Christensen, the film's documentary style is dramatized with horror sequences. Based partly on Christensen's study of the Malleus Maleficarum, a 15th-century German guide for inquisitors, H√§xan is a study of how superstition and the misunderstanding of diseases or mental illness could lead to the hysteria of the witch-hunts.Pilkington, Mark Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages Fortean Times, Dennis Publishing Ltd., October 2007 With Christensen's meticulous recreation of medieval scenes and the lengthy production period, the film was the most expensive Scandinavian silent film ever made, costing nearly two million Swedish kronor. Although it won acclaim in Denmark and Sweden, the film was banned in the United States and heavily censored in other countries for what were considered at that time graphic depictions of torture, nudity, and sexual perversion. Plot =Part 1= A scholarly dissertation on the appearances of demons and witches in primitive and medieval culture, a number of photographs of statuary, paintings, and woodcuts are used as demonstrative pieces. In addition, several large scale models are employed to demonstrate medieval concepts of the structure of the solar system and the commonly accepted depiction of Hell. =Part 2= A series of vignettes theatrically demonstrating medieval superstition and beliefs concerning witchcraft, including Satan (played by Christensen himself) tempting a sleeping woman away from her husband's bed before terrorizing a group of monks. Also shown is a woman purchasing a love potion from a supposed witch, and a sequence showing a supposed witch dreaming of flying through the air and attending a witches' gathering. =Part 3= A long narrative broken up into several parts. Set in the Middle Ages, it concerns an old woman accused of witchcraft by a dying man's family. The narrative is used to demonstrate the treatment of suspected witches by the religious authorities of the time. The old woman, after being tortured, admits to heavy involvement in witchcraft, including detailed descriptions of a Witches' Sabbath, even going so far as to \\"name\\" other supposed witches, including two of the women in the dying man's household. Eventually, the dying man's wife is arrested as a witch when one of the clergymen accuses her of bewitching him. =Part 4= The final part of the film seeks to demonstrate how the superstitions of old are better understood now. Christensen seeks to make the claim that most who were accused of witchcraft were possibly mentally ill, and in modern times, such behavior is interpreted as a disease. His case revolves around vignettes about a somnambulist and a kleptomaniac, the implication being that these behaviors would have been thought of as demonically-influenced in medieval times whereas modern societies recognize them as psychological ailments. Cast The cast of H√§xan includes: * Benjamin Christensen as the Devil * Ella la Cour as Sorceress Karna * Emmy Sch√∏nfeld as Karna's Assistant * Kate Fabian as the Old Maid * Oscar Stribolt as Fat Monk * Wilhelmine Henriksen as Apelone * Astrid Holm as Anna * Elisabeth Christensen as Anna's Mother * Karen Winther as Anna's Sister * Maren Pedersen as the Witch * Johannes Andersen as Pater Henrik, Witch Judge * Elith Pio as Johannes, Witch Judge * Aage Hertel as Witch Judge * Ib Sch√∏nberg as Witch Judge * Holst J√∏rgensen as Peter Titta (in Denmark called Ole Kighul) * Clara Pontoppidan as Sister Cecilia, Nun * Elsa Vermehren as Flagellating Nun * Alice O'Fredericks as Nun * Gerda Madsen as Nun * Karina Bell as Nun * Tora Teje as the Hysterical Woman * Poul Reumert as the Jeweller * H.C. Nilsen as the Jeweller's Assistant * Albrecht Schmidt as the Psychiatrist * Knud Rassow as the Anatomist Production After finding a copy of the Malleus Maleficarum in a Berlin bookshop, Christensen spent two years‚Äîfrom 1919 to 1921‚Äîstudying manuals, illustrations and treatises on witches and witch- hunting. He included a lengthy bibliography in the original playbill at the film's premiere. He intended to create an entirely new film rather than an adaptation of literary fiction, which was the case for films of that day. \\"In I am against these adaptations... I seek to find the way forward to original films.\\" Christensen obtained funding from the large Swedish production company Svensk Filmindustri, preferring it over the local Danish film studios, so that he could maintain complete artistic freedom. He used the money to buy and refurbish the Astra film studio in Hellerup, Denmark. Filming then ran from February through October 1921. Christensen and cinematographer Johan Ankerstjerne filmed only at night or in a closed set to maintain the film's dark hue. Post-production required another year before the film premiered in late 1922. Total cost for Svensk Film, including refurbishing the Astra Film Studio, reached between 1.5 and 2 million kronor, making H√§xan the most expensive Scandinavian silent film in history. Scores H√§xan has had numerous different live scores over the years. When it premiered in Sweden, its accompaniment was compiled from pre-existing compositions. Details of the selection, which met with the director's enthusiastic approval, have been lost, but it was probably the same documented music as for the Copenhagen premiere two months later. In Copenhagen, it was played by a 50-piece orchestra, and this score, combining pieces by Schubert, Gluck, and Beethoven, was restored and recorded with a smaller ensemble by arranger/conductor Gillian Anderson for the 2001 Criterion Collection DVD edition. Release The film premiered simultaneously in four Swedish cities ‚Äî Stockholm, Helsingborg, Malm√∂, and Gothenburg ‚Äî on 18 September 1922, unusual for Sweden at the time. It received its Danish premiere in Copenhagen on 7 November 1922. It was re-released in 1931 in Denmark with an extended introduction by Christensen. The intertitles were also changed in this version. In 1968, Metro Pictures Corporation re-edited and re-released H√§xan in the US as Witchcraft Through the Ages. It had added narration by William S. Burroughs and a jazz score by Daniel Humair, which was played by a quintet including Jean-Luc Ponty on violin. Restoration and home video The Swedish Film Institute has carried out three restorations of H√§xan: * 1976 tinted photochemical restoration * 2007 tinted photochemical restoration * 2012 tinted digital restoration The 1976 restoration was released on DVD in the US and UK in 2001 by Criterion and Tartan Video, along with Witchcraft Through the Ages, while the 2007 was released on DVD in Sweden by Svenska Filminstitutet. In 2013, the 2012 digital restoration was released exclusively on US Blu-ray by Criterion. Reception =Initial response= Academic James Kendrick writes that initial reviewers of H√§xan \\"were confounded by [its] boundary-crossing aesthetic.\\" Its thematic content stirred controversy as well. A contemporary critic in Variety, for example, praised the film's acting, production, and its many scenes of \\"unadulterated horror\\", but added that \\"wonderful though this picture is, it is absolutely unfit for public exhibition.\\" A Copenhagen reviewer was likewise offended by \\"the satanic, perverted cruelty that blazes out of it, the cruelty we all know has stalked the ages like an evil shaggy beast, the chimera of mankind. But when it is captured, let it be locked up in a cell, either in a prison or a madhouse. Do not let it be presented with music by Wagner or Chopin, [...] to young men and women, who have entered the enchanted world of a movie theatre.\\" Conversely, a critic for The New York Times wrote in 1929, \\"The picture is, for the most part, fantastically conceived and directed, holding the onlooker in a sort of medieval spell. Most of the characters seem to have stepped from primitive paintings.\\" The film also acquired a cult following among surrealists, who greatly admired its subversion. =Modern response= In the years since its debut, H√§xan has become regarded by critics and scholars as Christensen's masterpiece. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently has an 88% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.4/10, based on 16 reviews. In PopMatters, David Sanjek wrote, \\"The dazzling manner in which Haxan shifts from illustrated lecture to historical reenactment to special effects shots of witches on their broomsticks to modern-dress drama pointed to ways the documentary format could be used that others would not draw on until years into the future.\\" Peter Cowie similarly argued in Eighty Years of Cinema that it established Christensen as \\"an auteur of uncommon imagination and with a pictorial flair far ahead of his time.\\" Time Out London called it a \\"weird and rather wonderful brew of fiction, documentary and animation\\". Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars, lauding it as \\"visually stunning\\" and \\"genuinely scary\\". He additionally praised the director's performance as Satan. It is listed in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, which says \\"Part earnest academic exercise in correlating ancient fears with misunderstandings about mental illness and part salacious horror movie, H√§xan is truly a unique work that still holds power to unnerve, even in today's jaded era.\\" See also * List of films in the public domain * Haxan Films Bibliography * References External links * * H√§xan at Danish Film Institute (in Danish)  * * H√§xan at Silent Era *H√§xan an essay by Chris Fujiwara at the Criterion Collection *H√§xan: About the Music an essay by Gillian Anderson at the Criterion Collection * Evocative lobby poster Category:1922 films Category:1920s fantasy films Category:1922 horror films Category:Danish films Category:Danish horror films Category:Danish silent films Category:Danish documentary films Category:Swedish films Category:Swedish horror films Category:Swedish silent films Category:Folk horror films Category:Dark fantasy films Category:Swedish documentary films Category:Danish black-and-white films Category:Swedish black-and-white films Category:1920s supernatural horror films Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films using stop-motion animation Category:Films about psychiatry Category:Films shot in Denmark Category:Films directed by Benjamin Christensen Category:The Devil in fiction Category:Witch hunting Category:Films set in hell Category:Films set in the 1480s ","title":"H√§xan"},{"id":"3644913","text":"Mark Anthony Maher, better known by his stage name Kram, is an Australian musician and the drummer and singer of Spiderbait.

It is in the center of the city in the Pathum Wan District, and is operated by the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). Naming The station is officially referred to by the State Railway of Thailand as Sathani Rotfai Krung Thep (‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏µ‡∏£‡∏ñ‡πÑ‡∏ü‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û) in Thai (Krung Thep is the transliteration of the common Thai language name of Bangkok) and Bangkok Station in English. Hua Lamphong () is the informal name of the station, used by both foreign travellers and locals. The station is often named as Hua Lamphong in travel guide books and in the public press. In other areas of Thailand the station is commonly referred to as Krungthep Station, and the name Hua Lamphong is not well-known. In all documents published by the State Railway of Thailand (such as train tickets, timetables, and tour pamphlets) the station is uniformly transcribed as Krungthep (‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û) in Thai. There are a number of suggestions for the origin of the name Hua Lamphong. A common explanation is that it came from the word Wua Lamphong (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏≥‡∏û‡∏≠‡∏á) shortened from a former name for the area Thung Woa Lamphong meaning \\"The Field Of Wild Oxen\\". An alternative explanation is that it was derived from the word Lamphong (Datura metel) which is a plant that has toxic effects. It is also proposed that the name may have a Malay origin as a mixture of Khua in Thai, meaning \\"bridge\\", and the word Lamphung in Malay (pronounced Lumphung) meaning \\"temporary\\". Loi Khua Lumphung meaning a temporary bridge (across or floating in the river) then become known as Hua Lamphong by the Thais. History Bangkok railway station before 1970 The station was opened on 25 June 1916 after six years of construction that started in 1910 in the reign of King Chulalongkorn and finished in the reign of King Vajiravudh. The site of the railway station was previously occupied by the national railway's maintenance centre, which moved to Makkasan in June 1910. At the nearby site of the previous railway station a pillar commemorates the inauguration of the Thai railway network in 1897. The station was built in an Italian Neo-Renaissance-style, with decorated wooden roofs and stained glass windows, with the Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof in Germany as a prototype. The front of the building was designed by Turin-born Mario Tamagno, who with countryman Annibale Rigotti (1870‚Äì1968) was also responsible for the design of several other early 20th century public buildings in Bangkok. The pair designed Bang Khun Phrom Palace (1906), Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall in the Royal Plaza (1907‚Äì15) and Suan Kularb Residential Hall and Throne Hall in Dusit Garden, among other buildings. There are 14 platforms, 26 ticket booths, and two electric display boards. Hua Lamphong serves over 130 trains and approximately 60,000 passengers each day. Since 2004 the station has been connected by an underground passage to the MRT (Metropolitan Rapid Transit) subway system's Hua Lamphong MRT Station. The station is also a terminus of the Eastern and Oriental Express luxury trains, and the International Express to Malaysia. On 25 June 2019, the 103rd anniversary of Hua Lamphong was celebrated with a Google Doodle. Closure The station is scheduled to be closed for being main railway station in 2021, when it will be converted into a museum. The station will change its official name to Hua Lamphong station. The State Railway of Thailand plans to move Bangkok's central station to Bang Sue Grand Station.

The film debuted as the closing film of the Pusan International Film Festival in 2004. The film is based on novelist Kim Young-ha's short stories A Meditation On Mirror and Photo Shop Murder. Despite Lee Eun-ju's prior experience with depicting sex and nudity in Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors (2000), she came under the scrutiny of Korean press and netizens, for the highly emotional sex scenes and the notorious \\"trunk scene\\" in The Scarlet Letter which is regarded as \\"one of the most shocking and intense scenes in the history of Korean film.\\" It is speculated her demanding role and its public scrutiny, had compounded and overlapped with an existing variety of family, financial, career, and insomnia issues. Her severe depression ended in suicide in February 2005, and the tragic conclusion has since become the central focus in popular perception and interpretation of the film, this particular one being her last. Director Kim Ki-duk, no stranger to controversy over his own films, is quoted by Chinese film magazine \\"Movie Watch\\" (ÁúãÈõªÂΩ±) in singling out The Scarlet Letter as among the key Korean dramas from recent years. He subsequently cast Sung Hyun-ah, who rose to prominence with her role in The Scarlet Letter, as the heroine in his Time. At the film's premiere in Japan, veteran actress Kumiko Akiyoshi praised the lead performances and likened the film to a landmark in erotic thrillers after Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction.\\"Introductory dialogue at the Japanese premiere of The Scarlet Letter\\".

E√∂tv√∂s was born in Sz√©kelyudvarhely, Transylvania, then part of Hungary, now Romania. He studied composition in Budapest and Cologne. From 1962, he composed for film in Hungary. E√∂tv√∂s played regularly with the Stockhausen Ensemble between 1968 and 1976. He was a founding member of the Oeldorf Group in 1973, continuing his association until the late 1970s. From 1979 to 1991, he was musical director and conductor of the Ensemble InterContemporain (EIC). From 1985 to 1988, he was principal guest conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Early life As a child, E√∂tv√∂s received a thorough musical education, including works by B√©la Bart√≥k. He felt a strong link between Hungarian grammar and Bart√≥k's music, claiming that the specific \\"Hungarian\\" interpretations of music by Bart√≥k and Kod√°ly (as well as other Hungarian conductors such as Szell, Fricsay, Ormandy, Solti, Reiner) show subtle accents and rhythms of the Hungarian language. His mother, a pianist, participated in the musical and intellectual life of Budapest and took her son to many performances and rehearsals of opera, operetta and theatre. He learned the piano, and also wrote plays and small pieces. He won a composition contest at age eleven and was then noticed in the Hungarian artistic world. He then met Ligeti, 21 years his senior, who recommended him to Kod√°ly at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. He was accepted with honours at the Academy, where he studied composition with J√°nos Viski, on Kod√°ly's advice. In 1958, he was asked to accompany film projections with improvisations on piano and hammond organ. He was then asked to write scores for theatre and cinema. By 1970, he had composed several pieces of utility music. He learned the importance of timing and synchronisation. He also discovered noise as a sound, which was the starting point of some later compositions. The work Zero Points begins with a countdown, as if destined to synchronise sound and image, the double bass then takes on a high-pitched sound reminding the cracks of an old magnetic tape. During a period of ten years he developed personal musical preferences, for Gesualdo (the idea of the madrigal returns in pieces such as Drei Madrigalkom√∂dien and Tri sestry (Three Sisters)), American jazz of the 1960s, electronic music (of which Karlheinz Stockhausen's figure was inseparable), and Pierre Boulez, among others. He quickly distanced himself from other composers of the Academy.  Later career  In 1970, E√∂tv√∂s requested a scholarship to go study abroad, leaving for Cologne, Germany, following the examples of Kurt√°g and Ligeti. The Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln and the studio of the broadcaster Westdeutscher Rundfunk worked together at that time, which allowed students to use advanced technology in one of the best studios in Europe. E√∂tv√∂s worked there from 1971 to 1979 He studied composition with Bernd Alois Zimmermann, as well as conducting. He met Stockhausen, already knowing his work really well. E√∂tv√∂s became Stockhausen's engineer and copyist (the score of Telemusik is copied by him), and his musician and conductor, amongst other things conducting the La Scala premiere of Donnerstag aus Licht in 1981, as well as its Covent Garden performances in 1985. E√∂tv√∂s conducting in 2006 In 1978, Boulez asked him to conduct the opening concert of IRCAM in Paris. He was then appointed musical director of the Ensemble InterContemporain, holding the position until 1991. He performed at the Proms in 1980, and was regularly invited by the BBC Orchestra between 1985 and 1988. This period also marks his first success as a composer with his Chinese Opera (1986), written for the 10-year anniversary of the Ensemble InterContemporain. The piece constitutes a reflexion on the theatricality of sound, as the composer spreads the musicians through the stage, a process also found in Three Sisters. Each movement is a tribute to directors he admired: Bob Wilson, Klaus Michael Gr√ºber, Luc Bondy, Patrice Ch√©reau, Jacques Tati and Peter Brook. Jean-Pierre Brossman, director of the Op√©ra National de Lyon at that time, admired his ability to take into consideration the work of artists and directors, and commissioned an opera in 1986: Three Sisters, based on Chekhov's play. In 2008, he premiered two other operas, Lady Sarashina and Love and Other Demons. E√∂tv√∂s was principal guest conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra from 2003 to 2007. His recording of Luciano Berio's Sinfonia with the London Voices (DG) received the award for \\"Technical excellence in recording\\" by the BBC Music Magazine in 2006. He served as a member of the jury of the T≈çru Takemitsu composition competition in 2014. Composition style E√∂tv√∂s's music shows the influence of a variety of composers. As director of the Ensemble InterContemporain, he was exposed to styles, as is evidenced in the variety of timbres and soundworlds within his music. Extended techniques such as over-pressure bowings coexist with lyrical folk songs and synthesized sounds. E√∂tv√∂s provides detailed instructions on how to mix instruments for electronic manipulation or amplification. His first large-scale compositions were for film. This often reflects on his later pieces in moments of atmospheric airiness. Two of his compositions for orchestra and voice, Atlantis and Ima, were inspired by S√°ndor We√∂res' poem N√©ma zene. Most of his works are published by Schott Music in Mainz.

It is a small sea-side suburb, population 2,918, about to the south of the Adelaide city centre and was originally created as a sea port. This area is now popular as a holiday destination or for permanent residents wishing to commute to Adelaide or work locally. There is a jetty that connects to a long natural reef that is exposed at low tide. The beach is large and very long and has reasonable surfing in the South Port area whose name is taken from its location - 'South of the Port'. The suburb is bounded to the south by the Onkaparinga River, including a tidal estuary. It is bounded to the west by the coastline with Gulf St Vincent, by Christies Beach to the north and by Noarlunga Centre and Noarlunga Downs to the east.< History In pre-European times, this area along with most of the Adelaide plains was inhabited by the Kaurna tribe. The first record of the area was provided by Captain Collet Barker who explored the Onkaparinga River on 15 April 1831 in his search for a Gulf outlet from Lake Alexandrina. In early 1837, while camped by the Sturt River near Marion, South Australia's only two horses slipped their tether ropes during the night and the overseer of stock, C.W. Stuart led an expedition to recover them. Taking a botanist to record the plants encountered, the expedition searched much of present-day Noarlunga before finding the horses near the Onkaparinga River. The men being on foot were however, unable to capture them. In June 1837, Colonel William Light led an overland expedition to arrest whalers who had been abducting native women at Encounter Bay, 100 km south of Adelaide. Cresting Tapleys Hill they named the valley Morphett Vale after expedition member John Morphett. They reached the southern end of the Mount Lofty Ranges before impenetrable scrub forced them to return to Adelaide. The following year, John McLaren of the Survey Dept. divided the area south of Adelaide into three districts (B.C and D) based on the reports made by the Stuart and Light expeditions. B and C districts, the present Noarlunga District, was opened to public selection in February 1839 and by 1841 the population was estimated to be about 150.David J. Towler A Fortunate Locality-History of Noarlunga and Districts Published for the City of Noarlunga by Peacock Publications 1986 A shore-based bay whaling station was established near the mouth of the Onkaparinga River by George Heppenstall in 1841.Parry Kostoglou & Justin McCarthy (1991) Whaling and sealing sites in South Australia, Australian Institute for Maritime Archaeology, Fremantle (WA), p.38. The operation consisted of 25 men and two boats. They also had a small punt which was used as a cutting-in platform. Heppenstall built a house nearby which he later called \\"Whaleview.\\" It is reputed to be the first permanent structure in the area. The fishery ceased operation in 1843. The government town of Port Noarlunga was surveyed and offered for sale on 14 April 1859.Martella, L: \\"Port Noarlunga An Endearing Coastal Town\\". Lita Martella, 2000 The township was originally settled as a port for the produce from the proposed market town of Noarlunga a few kilometres upstream. The Onkaparinga River mouth proved unsuitable to coastal ketches, so produce was barged down river to the sandhills and then taken by horse drawn rail trucks to the jetty. The current jetty was constructed in 1921 and is the second jetty to have been constructed at Port Noarlunga. The original jetty, 30 metres south of the current jetty, was constructed in 1855, but was destroyed in several severe storms in the early 1900s. In the early 20th century Port Noarlunga was a popular coastal holiday destination, with the beach proving an attraction with its natural beauty and in summer amusement fairs were run, as well as row boating on the river estuary. Port Noarlunga Post Office opened around November 1909. With the gradual incursion of urban sprawl, and in particular immigration-fuelled expansion in the 1960s and 1970s, the township eventually became an outer suburb of Adelaide. The South Australian Housing Trust in particular developed housing in the nearby areas of Christies Beach and O'Sullivan Beach and with the extension of the metropolitan rail line to adjacent Noarlunga Centre in 1978 the township of Port Noarlunga had largely lost its attraction as a holiday destination. It is now largely occupied by permanent residents, although it still retains much of its early village charm. The City of Onkaparinga council has assisted with maintaining this spirit of the old township, working with the State government in the late 1990s to divert through road traffic around the town centre. =State heritage places= The following places within Port Noarlunga are listed as ‚Äòstate heritage places‚Äô on the South Australian Heritage Register: *Perry Homestead, 80 Murray Road. *Dwelling and outbuildings, 53 Old Honeypot Road. *Port Noarlunga Hotel, 29 Saltfleet Street. *Sauerbier's House, 21 Wearing Street. Attractions Port Noarlunga jetty =Beach and jetty= Port Noarlunga beach is popular with tourists and residents with safe swimming areas patrolled by two surf life saving clubs. It features in the 2012 book 101 Best Australian Beaches by Andy Short and Brad Farmer. The first jetty at Port Noarlunga was constructed for coastal trade. Work commenced in 1854 and on its completion the following year it was known as Port Onkaparinga. The first jetty had fallen into disrepair by the turn of the 20th century. Interest was expressed in repairing or replacing the jetty during the 1910s, but work did not commence until the conclusion of World War I due to difficulties obtaining government funding. Plans were made and tenders were called in October 1918. At its official opening in December 1921 it stood 1,250 feet in length and had been constructed at a cost of ‚Ç§6000-7000. The present timber jetty extends from the shore over the beach and out towards the reef, which forms a natural breakwater. It is illuminated at night and features three staircases, one that leads down to the beach, and two that provide access to the water to swimmers, snorkelers and divers. It is also accessible to wheelchairs and scooters. In November 2018, the stairs at the reef end of the jetty were dislodged from the main structure by strong winds and wave energy during a storm. They were replaced with a sturdier modern construction featuring multiple platforms in 2020. The remains of the old jetty's piles lie 30 metres to the south of the existing jetty and are occasionally exposed following storms. = Township = There is also a small main street (Gawler Street) that serves visitors and locals in this beach area. It has several cafes, a pub, a fish and chip shop, a surf shop and several other businesses providing services to the locals. The old \\"Institute\\" building, built in 1924, is now the community centre. =Port Noarlunga Reef= Port Noarlunga Reef is regarded as one of South Australia's best snorkeling sites and is popular with underwater photographers. It is a narrow reef about offshore and about long and was formed from a consolidated Pleistocene sand dune. The reef runs parallel to shore and has two sections, with the area separating them called The Gap. It is a popular scuba diving and snorkelling location, with more than 200 marine plant species and over 70 fish species. There is a self-guided diving trail which was established in 1994, which is marked with a series of 12 glass plaques. The plaques indicate aspects of the reef ecosystem relevant to their location. = Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve = Port Noarlunga Reef at low tide, view to South from the jetty The Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve is one of six aquatic reserves proclaimed in South Australia in 1971 with it being established specifically to protect the reef life and the adjacent river estuary. The boundaries of the reserve were extended to the north in 1993 to include an adjacent limestone reef known as Horseshoe Reef at Christies Beach. As of 2007, it extends along the coastline from Onkaparinga Head at Port Noarlunga South in the south to Gulfview Road at Christies Beach in the north and includes the Onkaparinga River up until the Main South Road at Old Noarlunga. The reserve covers an area of . Fishing activity is limited to the use of rod and handline while the use of ‚Äòhand nets for the taking of shrimps for bait only‚Äô is permitted in estuary and the Onkaparinga River. No fishing is permitted within of Horseshoe and Port Noarlunga Reefs and can only be carried out from the jetty and the beach at Port Noarlunga. = Port Noarlunga tyre reef & shipwrecks = Three artificial reefs lie in close proximity to each other, offshore from Port Noarlunga, and can be explored by divers. The Port Noarlunga Tyre Reef is a man-made construction of tyre pyramids in 20 metres of water. Nearby lie the H. A. Lumb (a steel tug) and the MV Seawolf (a former fishing boat). The H. A. Lumb was scuttled by the Dive Industry Association in 1994 and the MV Seawolf was scuttled by the Seawolves dive club in 2002 after fundraising efforts. The H.A. Lumb lies in 20 metres of water 2.5 kms west of the Port Noarlunga jetty, with the MV Seawolf is located slightly to the south east of her. All three sites can be accessed during a single dive. =Port Noarlunga Aquatic Centre= Since 1976 the Port Noarlunga Aquatic Centre has operated classes for primary school children from throughout the state. The program runs in the first and last school terms each year and provides the opportunity to try waveskiing, canoeing, fishing, snorkelling, sailing, swimming and sailboarding. About 15,000 students have access to this program each year. Protected area status Port Noarlunga includes parts of the following protected areas. The Encounter Marine Park and the Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve both occupy land within the intertidal zone of the suburb along the coastline with Gulf St Vincent and the Onkaparinga River. The Encounter Marine Park also occupies the undeveloped area in the south of the suburb adjoining the mouth of the Onkaparinga River.

It was painted in the baroque style, probably between the years 1658 and 1659, using oil on canvas. Since 1901 it has been in the Frick Collection in New York City. In this painting, Vermeer depicts a young woman at her music with an older gentleman. This painting shows the typical courtship during the 17th century in Europe. It also focuses on the importance of music when it comes to love. The room that they are shown in is one of higher class, most likely belonging to a person of haute bourgeoisie. The painting is very reminiscent of Vermeer‚Äôs other works. Important objects and symbols =Wine glass= The wine glass, discreetly shown on the table behind the songbook, is tied with both joyfulness and seduction. In the 17th century it was popular to paint scenes that depicted feasts that included drinking, gaming, and playing music. Later on, these large gatherings became smaller and more exclusive with two or three people shown. Drinking wine was also associated with love during this time period. You can see that the glass is full and untouched, which symbolizes the slow moving relationship between the man and the woman. =Window= On the left side of the painting is a multi-paned window, from which the light source is provided for the scene. Vermeer used the same window design in nine of his other works (The Music Lesson, The Girl with the Wine Glass, The Glass of Wine, Officer and Laughing Girl, Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid, Woman with a Water Jug, Woman with a Lute, Woman Holding a Balance, and Woman with a Pearl Necklace). Some experts questioned whether this painting was by Vermeer. The precision of the lighting from the window was thought to prove that it was in fact an original Vermeer. =Chairs= The chairs depicted in the painting are thought to have been from Spain. They are some of the few objects in the painting that were not damaged by heavy restoration. You can see the minute details including the lion head carving, the brass studs, and the ‚Äúlozenge‚Äù pattern that were all popular aspects of furniture during the time. =Painting= The hazy painting in the background of the scene is of Cupid. The painting within a painting was discovered after its restoration in 1907; it had been covered up by a wall and a hanging violin. Several observations have been made about the Cupid painting and what it could have to do with the overall painting, including that Cupid may be warning the couple about the dangers of love, that Cupid's upraised hand was a symbol that you must only have one lover, that Cupid is holding up a blank card which represents love as a game, or shows that \\"love is in the air\\". The reason for Vermeer including the miniature Cupid painting may never be revealed due to the painting's damaged condition. =Vase= On the table sits a vase made of porcelain and silver, likely used for serving wine. One of the main centers for porcelain in the Netherlands was and still is Delft, although they had \\"limited success\\" in recreating Chinese porcelain. =Man= The man in the painting is likely upper class, due to his fashionable attire. =Music= Love and music often went hand in hand in the 17th century, especially with the presence of a musical duet between a man and a woman. Playing music with one another was one of the few activities where young people of the opposite sex could socialize. The two in the painting were likely part of the haute bourgeoisie, which meant that they were worldly and educated when it came to music, and each likely had a personal collection of songbooks. Cultural references The painting is a theme in the book Girl, Interrupted, the title of that book being based on the title of the painting.

History The date the school was founded is unknown, but the earliest known reference to the school is in a church document dated 1592, which mentions the 'Master of Lymm School'. In 1601, it was granted a royal charter and reconstituted as 'Lymm Grammar School' on its Damside site. It remained in this location for several hundred years, occupying some of the buildings which now make up St Mary's Church, until it was forced to sell its land in 1881 after a series of financial difficulties. The land was split into 11 lots, with 5 of them being purchased by G C Dewhurst, who was a member of the board of governors. In February 1882, he informed the board that he would give a different site near Higher Lane for a school and school house and would also pay for a road to be made to the site - Grammar School Road. An appeal was launched to raise the necessary funds for the construction of the buildings and a committee formed to co-ordinate the collection. The new buildings opened on 12 July 1885. In 1900, a motion was made before the governors council to enable co-education. This was introduced in June 1902, with the first female students starting in the September. The School remained unchanged on its Grammar School Lane site until, in 1945, Headteacher J. R. Canney, advised Cheshire County Council to purchase Oughtrington Hall to be used as an annexe. The hall was used by junior forms from 1945 to 1957, when the whole school was transferred to the site, with the buildings in Grammar School Road becoming the site of the newly formed Lymm Secondary Modern School. The school became a (Controlled) Grammar School under the changes of an Education Act and Students were admitted to the school without payment of fees. A history of the school was written and published by a history master at the school Mr Kay, circa 1962. It gave significantly more information than is currently recorded in this summary of the School's Pedigree. At a similar time application was made to the College of Heralds and received for the full Coat of Arms. A revision of the School's Blazer Badge and Sixth Form Tie followed. The School was supported throughout by an enthusiastic Parent Teachers Association and Old Pupils Association who raised significant funds which paid for the provision of a swimming pool, a school camp in Anglesey Nr R.A.F. Valley and many other facilities to improve the life of the students. The two institutions remained separate until their amalgamation under the Comprehensive system in the early 1980s In the Grammar School Road buildings were sold and demolished to make way for housing. In the 1990s and early 2000s a development programme saw much of the surrounding farmland being bought for playing fields, and many of the existing playing fields being built on. This programme reached its peak in 2002, with the opening of the new Sixth Form Building (the original Sixth Form Building, from the amalgamation in 1994 until 2002, being sited in the old stable block of the original Oughtrington Hall). Location The school is located on Oughtrington Lane, towards the eastern side of Lymm village, adjacent to the village Cricket Club in the grounds of Oughtrington Hall, which houses the school library. In addition to the old hall and stables, there are 5 newer buildings (Blocks A, B, D, E, L, N and S) which house the majority of the classrooms and specialist facilities. The Original Sixth Form Block (Block S) contains a large central room known as the hexagon, where the sixth form students gather in their study periods, break and lunch, but can double up as a formal gathering area when required, for both school and non-school purposes. Entry Entry is non-selective, and available to all those residing in the catchment area. This currently covers Lymm, Thelwall, High Legh and Statham, as well as parts of Grappenhall, Little Bollington, Dunham Town, and areas of Stockton Heath. In recent years, this area has been dramatically reduced in size in response to the growing number of pupils, leading to an increase in the catchment area for nearby Bridgewater High School. Ofsted inspections The school was judged to be \\"outstanding\\" in a 2008 Ofsted inspection. The new headteacher at Lymm High School, Angela Walsh, (who was banned from teaching and fired in 2016, due to personal usuage of school money)http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/14474406.___Dishonest____ex_Lymm_High_head_banned_from_teaching/ was commended in January 2009 for her 'clear vision' in maintaining the school's excellent standards. She said: \\"I feel privileged to have joined this exceptional school, and our fantastic inspection results are thanks to the hard work and commitment of students, staff and parents.\\" Although the school achieved an outstanding in the above inspection, during the December 2013 inspection, the schools standards have significantly dropped. The school was judged to be good in all areas, therefore resulting in an overall \\"Good\\" achievement for the school. Halls All students are members of a hall as well as of the school. 2 forms per yeargroup from year 7-13 go into each hall. The halls system was established in September 2002, with the original four houses (named after key local families) being supplanted by a five new ones (named after local stately homes). The original houses were Domville, Ridgeway, Warbuton and Watkin; the new halls are Arley, Dunham, Moreton, Tatton and Walton. Each hall has an associated colour. Sport In rugby, the school has won the Daily Mail Vase along with the Under 15's Daily Mail Cup in 2006. In rowing, the school regularly wins head of the river at a number of different regattas. Old Students Association Old students of the school are known as 'Old Lymmians', with the 'Lymm Old Students Association' acting as their co-ordinating body. As of 2005, its primary tasks are communicating school related news through its thriving local and international membership, organising local events (Such as its regular rambling trips), raising money for the school, orchestrating reunions, and providing networking events The Old Students Association tie is composed of alternate diagonal stripes of dark green, dark blue, and white. The Old Students Association blazer is dark green, edged with a 1-inch-wide border of white cotton.

It is the sixth film in The Pink Panther comedy film series. Released in 1978, it is the final on-set performance of \\"Inspector Jacques Clouseau\\" by Peter Sellers, who died in 1980.  Plot  Philippe Douvier (Robert Webber), a major businessman and secretly the head of the French Connection, is suspected by his New York Mafia drug trading partners of weak leadership and improperly conducting his criminal affairs. To demonstrate otherwise, Douvier's aide Guy Algo (Tony Beckley) suggests a show of force with the murder of the famous Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers). Unfortunately for Douvier, his first attempt at bombing Clouseau fails, and the subsequent attempt by Chinese martial artist 'Mr. Chong' (an uncredited appearance by the founder of American Kenpo, Ed Parker) is thwarted when Clouseau successfully fights him off (believing him to be Clouseau's valet Cato (Burt Kwouk), who has orders to keep his employer alert with random attacks). Douvier tries again by posing as an informant to lure Clouseau into a trap, but the Chief Inspector's car and clothes are stolen by transvestite criminal Claude Russo (Sue Lloyd), who is unknowingly killed by Douvier's men instead. Subsequently, Douvier and the French public believe Clouseau is dead; as a result of this assumption, Clouseau's ex-boss, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), is restored to sanity and is released from the lunatic asylum to perform the investigation (despite having committed several major crimes and then seemingly disintegrated in the previous film). In Russo's clothes and insisting on his true identity, Clouseau is taken to the asylum himself but escapes into Dreyfus' room, who faints from the shock of seeing Clouseau alive. Clouseau manages to disguise himself as Dreyfus and is driven home by Fran√ßois (Andr√© Maranne). At home, Clouseau finds Cato, who, despite having turned Clouseau's apartment into a Chinese-themed brothel, is relieved to see that he survived and the two plan revenge on the sponsor of Clouseau's assassination. Meanwhile, Dreyfus is assigned to read a eulogy at Clouseau's funeral by the police chief's wife, on pain of his own discharge. At the cemetery, Clouseau attends the burial disguised as a priest and then surreptitiously reveals himself to Dreyfus, who recognizes him, faints, and falls into the grave. Clouseau escapes. Meanwhile, due to his unfaithfulness, Douvier's wife threatens him with divorce. Needing her respectability, Douvier tells his secretary and paramour Simone LeGree (Dyan Cannon) that their relationship is over, to which Simone reacts angrily. Fearing that she will reveal his crimes, Douvier gives orders to have Simone killed at her nightclub, but having been told by an informant (Alfie Bass) of the possibility of trouble there, Clouseau and Cato inadvertently manage to save her. At Simone's flat, Clouseau reveals his identity, prompting her to reveal that Douvier ordered Clouseau's assassination. Finally, she tells him of Douvier's plan to meet the New York Mafia godfather Julio Scallini (Paul Stewart) in Hong Kong for the Gannet Transaction - a $50,000,000 heroin sale. After evading their pursuers, Clouseau, Cato, and Simone follow Douvier to Hong Kong in disguise, unaware that the now suspicious Dreyfus has followed them. There, Clouseau impersonates Scallini while Simone distracts the real one, but the plan goes awry when one of Scallini's men spots Douvier leaving their hotel with a stranger and Clouseau exposes his own disguise during the Gannet Transaction. In the confusion, Dreyfus, intent on killing Clouseau chases him into a firework warehouse, accidentally activating all the fireworks inside. After the events that occurred in Hong Kong, Douvier and Scallini are arrested. Clouseau is awarded for their arrest by the President of France, and he and Simone spend an evening together.

He suggested that Revenge of the Pink Panther should primarily be made up of this footage and that he would write and shoot new footage around it with Sellers and company. Sellers balked at this and insisted that Revenge feature all new footage. Sellers' contract for Revenge gave him story approval, which is why that film carries a story credit for Sellers that none of the previous films had. The opening animated titles in the film were designed by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, who had been involved with the series since the animated titles of the original 1963 film, The Pink Panther. It was the first time since Inspector Clouseau in 1968 that DePatie-Freleng animated the opening titles of a Pink Panther film (Return and Strikes Again having been done by Richard Williams' Studio). The film was shot in France, England and in Hong Kong with some scenes filmed at The Excelsior hotel. This is Graham Stark's first appearance as Professor Auguste Balls. He portrays him once more in Son of the Pink Panther (1993). Harvey Korman portrays Professor Balls in footage seen in Trail of the Pink Panther (1982).Leonard Maltin's 2015 Movie Guide Release The film had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on July 13, 1978 and opened to the public the following day. It opened in the United States at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City and at the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles on July 19, 1978 before expanding to 387 theatres across the United States. =Critical reception= Variety wrote, \\"Revenge of the Pink Panther isn't the best of the continuing film series, but Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers on a slow day are still well ahead of most other comedic filmmakers.\\" Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times \\"If you have the habit, as I have, there's very little that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Sellers could do that would make you find the movie disappointing.\\" One DVD & video guide gave the movie four and a half out five stars, calling it \\"arguably the best of the slapstick series.\\"Martin, Mick, and Porter, Marsha (2006). DVD & Video Guide 2007, p. 542. Ballantine Books. In 1979, the film won the Evening Standard British Film Award for best comedy.IMDb Awards (1979). =Box office= The film grossed $62,810 in its first three days at the Odeon Leicester Square. On its US release, it grossed $5,278,784 in its first 5 days of release from 387 theatres and $11,004,124 in its first 12 days from 461 theatres in the United States and Canada.  Cancelled sequel  The Romance of the Pink Panther was a Pink Panther film that Sellers had written‚Äîand willing to make without Edwards‚Äîbefore Sellers' death in July 1980. UA considered recasting the role before convincing Blake Edwards to return to the series. Edwards chose to replace Clouseau with a new character rather than replace Sellers as Clouseau and to utilize outtakes from The Pink Panther Strikes Again to set up a transitional film (Trail of the Pink Panther) with new linking footage shot on the set of the new film (Curse of the Pink Panther).  Soundtrack  Composed by Henry Mancini in his fifth Pink Panther film, its theme music and much of the soundtrack draw heavily from the disco trends of the late 1970s. The \\"Pink Panther Theme\\" itself was reworked to include a more dancy bassline, electric piano and guitar solo. A soundtrack album for the film was released by United Artists Records.

Founded in 1959, it has continued to grow and now offers a wide range of financial services. It has nine offices in Bogot√°, and five regional offices located in Cali, Medell√≠n, Bucaramanga, Barranquilla and Santa Fe de Bogot√°. Corficolombiana offers three specialized services: credit, investments and financial intermediation, offering its clients a consultant's office, financing, investment, security and yield optimization. In 1999, Corficolombiana merged with three other financial corporations, La Corporaci√≥n Financiera de los Andes (Financial Corporation of the Andes), La Corporaci√≥n Financiera Santander (Santander Financial Corporation) and Indufinanciera. The purpose of the merger was to pool resources and to create an efficient financial infrastructure. Between 1999 and 2000, Corficolombiana received capitalization of more than 130 billion pesos, allowing the company to continue in its financial endeavours. Corficolombiana S.A. belongs to Grupo Aval, one of the largest economic organizations in Colombia, with investments in diverse sectors of the economy. By late 2005 Corficolombiana S.A. initiated a merger with La Corporacion Financiera del Valle (Corfivalle). History of Corfivalle Corfivalle (La Corporaci√≥n Financiera del Valle) began on April 27, 1961, when more than one hundred investors met at the Cali Chamber of Commerce and signed Articles of Incorporation. The articles were approved October 2, 1961, by the Office of Banking Supervision. On November 27, the Articles of Incorporation were released to the public and the corporation opened to business that same day, having a supervisor and nine employees on the payroll, with offices in Cali and Bogot√°. Also in 1961, Corfivalle opened its International Department, and received its first Letter of Credit from a foreign bank in order to finance the purchase of new equipment. In 1980, the Colombian government released its control on interest rates, leading to a significant business boom. 1981, Corfivalle looked to create within the financial system a new type of financial interest involved in the robust capital market, as well as the acquisition of resources necessary to assure the development of the most productive sectors of the economy. By 1982, Corfivalle specialized in offering credits for the repayment of a contract at a discount and in promoting projects financed within the guidelines of the World Bank. In 1984, Corfivalle opened an office in Medell√≠n, and a second office in Bogot√°. In 1985, the International Finance Corporation extended credit, underwritten by the United States, of $6 million to Corfivalle, having a term of 8 years with a 5 year grace period. In 1992, the Apex Holding Company was created to for participation in the stock market. This company included the IFC of the World Bank, and the Mexican Stock Market, each with 20% of the shares, while Corfivalle maintained 60%. In 1994, Cofivalle Finance Bahamas Limited was established. This allowed Corfaville to expand its business and to remain one of Colombia's key financial institutions. In 2005 Corfivalle purchased Corficolombiana, but was not the nominal successor. Since 2006, Corfivalle is a trademark of Corficolombiana S.A.

Biography Originally a student of law, he entered the literary world with a series of poetic works inspired by his native Andalucia (De la vida sencilla, A la rueda, rueda, El barrio de Santa Cruz, and Las flores del bien). In the 1930s he became a journalist. In 1935 he joined the Real Academia de la Lengua, of which he was the director from 1939 to 1940 and 1944 to 1947. Pem√°n often blurred literary genres, and developed a unique style that may be as equidistant between classicism and modernism. As a dramatist, he wrote historical-religious verse (El divino impaciente and Cuando las Cortes de C√°diz y Cisneros), plays based on Andalusian themes (Noche de levante en calma), and comical costume dramas (Julieta y Romeo and El viento sobre la tierra). Pem√°n adapted many classical works (including Antigone, Hamlet, and Oedipus). He displayed his narrative skill in a series of novels and short stories (including Historia del fantasma y do√±a Juanita, Cuentos sin importancia, and La novela de San Mart√≠n). He was also a noted essayist. In 1955 he received the Mariano de Cavia prize for journalism. In 1957, he won the March de Literatura prize. He was the personal advisor to the Count of Barcelona from 1969 until the title's dissolution. In 1981, a few months before his death he was named Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Pem√°n was one of the few prominent intellectuals to support Francisco Franco and the Falangist movement. This ensured his professional success during and after the Civil War, but damaged his international reputation. Pem√°n wrote a set of unofficial, although \\"officiose\\" popular lyrics for the Marcha Real, which Franco reestablished as Spain's national anthem in 1939 in its original and ever official way, musical only, despite some popular unsustained assumptions about Marquina's lyrics officialty . His never published on the BOE (Official State Bulletin) lyrics remained in use by some nostalgics during the Transition period.

Ecologist Eric Pianka characterizes it as a gesture that is \\"diagnostic of Australia\\". The Australian bush fly (Musca vetustissima) is the species that is the cause of the Aussie salute as opposed to other flies such as the housefly, as the Australian bush fly is attracted to bodily fluids such as sweat, nasal mucus, saliva, tears and blood.Roger D. Moon (2009). \\"Muscid flies (Muscidae)\\". In Gary R. Mullen, Gary Mullen & Lance Durden. Medical and Veterinary Entomology. Academic Press. pp. 268‚Äì288. . The Aussie salute can often be seen in outdoor television news reports or interviews, a recent example being a news report by ABC Television on flooding in Eugowra. Historically in Australia, the cork hat was worn to discourage Australian bush flies, but it has been replaced by insect repellents and mesh masks in areas where the flies swarm. Australian bush flies are disease vectors, since they walk on dung and carrion and, if not prevented from doing so, can lead to infections, including eye infections such as \\"sandy blight\\". Pianka reports that the Aussie salute is effective only as long as the flies are not too sticky, and that once a fly has tasted sweat, hand waving is generally useless at encouraging it to leave, with physically wiping off the fly being required to get rid of it. The introduction of various species of dung beetles to Australia as a control mechanism in the 20th century was successful and reduced the population of the Australian bush fly by about 90%.

This program was supported by the OSEO. It was a French project with the participation of several German partners. The consortium was led by Thomson SA. Other companies involved in the consortium were France T√©l√©com, Exalead, , Jouve, , Vecsys, Vocapia Research, LTU Technologies, and Synapse D√©veloppement. Many public research institutes were also involved, including National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control, Laboratoire d'informatique pour la m√©canique et les sciences de l'ing√©nieur, IRCAM, RWTH Aachen, University of Karlsruhe, Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse, Clips Imag, Groupe des √âcoles des T√©l√©communications, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique; as well as other public organisations such as Institut national de l'audiovisuel, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, LIPN, and Direction G√©n√©rale de l'Armement. According to the AII press release, the main targeted applications could be divided into three broad classes: multimedia indexing and search tools for professional and general public use, including mobile environments; professional solutions for production, post-production, management and distribution of multimedia documents; and facilitation of access to cultural heritage such as audiovisual archives and digital libraries. Announcements and history Quaero was announced by Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schr√∂der during the French-German ministerial conference in April 2005. It was put forward again by Jacques Chirac in August 2005 at the inauguration of the new agency created to fund such programs, the Agence de l'innovation industrielle (AII), and in January 2006 in his New Year addresses, which received much attention from the public. Quaero was part of the first programs selected by the AII in April 2006. In December 2006, the new German government announced that it would devote its share of the funding to a slightly modified program geared toward knowledge management and semantic web, under the name of . Quaero received the approval of the European Commission in March 2008. ‚Ç¨99m from the French government would go towards development of the program. The search engine Quaero was often described as a European competitor to Google as well as to other commercial search engines such as Yahoo, Microsoft's Bing and Ask.com. Quaero was not intended to be a text-based search engine but was mainly meant for multimedia search. The search engine would have used techniques for recognizing, transcribing, indexing, and automatic translation of audiovisual documents and would have operated in several languages. There was also a plan to have automatic recognition and indexing of images. According to an article in The Economist, Quaero would have allowed users to search using a \\"query image\\", not just a group of keywords. In a process known as \\"image mining\\", software that recognizes shapes and colours would have been used to look for and retrieve still images and video clips that contained images similar to the query image. (The software was supplied by LTU Technologies.) As France was researching image-searching, Germany was supposed to be advancing voice clip and sound media searches, with the intention of transcribing their content to text, and translating it to other languages, before they pulled out of the project. This would also allow for \\"query sound clips\\" following the paradigm of the \\"query image\\" mentioned above.  Criticism  The French satirical newspaper Le Canard encha√Æn√© pointed out that the funding behind the project was dwarfed by both Microsoft and Google. Search experts Autonomy, (Financial Times) called the plan \\"a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism\\". The main issues being that: by the time of Quaero's launch, the search engine market would already have been generations ahead of Quaero in media and device capabilities; some argue that Chirac was more interested in defending French pride than global advancement of the Internet. Writing in IEEE Spectrum, Nick Tredennick commented that \\"Going head-to-head with Google with a project involving well-funded, energetic entrepreneurs would be foolish. Attempting the same with a multigovernment collaboration is beyond description.\\" Ross, P. E. (2007). What's the Latin for \\"delusional\\"? IEEE Spectrum, 44(1), pp. 49-50. According to the print edition of The Economist, January 6, 2007 (pp. 5), Quaero \\"was reportedly scrapped\\" since the German part \\"grumbled about the cost and have indicated they will produce their own, scaled-down search engine\\".  German departure  On December 18, 2006, , a state secretary within the Ministry for Economics and Labour, announced during the IT-summit in Potsdam that a German consortium had put together a semantic search project called that would be distinct from Quaero. The main source of disagreement was the format of the search engine, with German engineers favoring a text-based search engine and the French engineers favoring a multimedia search engine. Many German engineers also balked at what they thought was becoming too much of an anti-Google project, rather than a project driven by its own ideals.  End  The project ended on December 31, 2013.

It was published on 8 September 2005, alongside Only Human and The Stealers of Dreams. It features the Ninth Doctor, Rose Tyler and Captain Jack. It is the first original novel to feature Captain Jack. Synopsis The TARDIS lands the Doctor, Rose and Jack at an abandoned Soviet naval base. However, something is still lurking -- something which is treating all humans, including Rose and Jack, as prey. But as the Doctor investigates further, he uncovers an experiment years in the making. Plot Captain Jack Harkness is in the TARDIS, when suddenly the console starts bleeping. The Doctor and Rose come running in, and he tells them it is a distress call. The bleeping gets louder, and the Doctor says it's all right, because someone has responded to the signal. Rose wonders who, and Jack admits that he did, which means they are morally obligated to investigate. The Doctor says the signal is from Earth - early twenty-first century. When the TARDIS lands, they find themselves on a cold, windy, snow-covered cliff top with a ring of standing stones. As they look at it, a helicopter rises to cliff level, and soldiers with rifles start to leap out. The soldiers want to know why the Doctor, Rose and Jack are there, so the Doctor pulls out his psychic paper and says that they have orders to be there too. As they are talking, Colonel Levin gets a message that a body (in very bad condition) has been found in the stone circle. Levin sends someone down to the village (near the submarine base that was abandoned twenty years ago) to fetch a woman named Sofia Barinska, who is the police officer there. She thinks the body is of a boy named Pavel Vahlen, who disappeared the night before. The girl he was thought to be with is still missing. Jack goes with a soldier named Sergeyev to look for her. Jack and the soldiers fan out in the woods to search, and Jack almost trips over the missing girl. She alive, but her face has become very old, and she is unresponsive. She is helped up, and then Jack supports her out of the woods and back to the circle. Sofia tells them that he name is Valeria Mamentova. She thinks the cause is Vourdulak, a kind of Russian vampire. They take Valeria and the body to the research institute. There are four people working there: Igor Klebanov (who was there when the base was all but closed down), Alex Minin (who handles that admin side of things, but is hated because he was previously the political officer), and two students who are there as part of their university training, Boris Brodsky & Catherine Kornilova. The Doctor asks Rose to check out the village, and see what she can find out, so she rides down with Sofia. The village's power comes from the diesel generators on board the subs, and Nikolai Stresnev keeps them running. After talking to Pavel's parents and checking Sofia's house for messages, she and Rose go to the inn. It is a building that used to be the harbormaster's office, but now functions as an inn, community centre, and town hall. The Doctor has a sample of one of the standing stones and wants to see what it is made of. He is told by Klebanov to ask Minin, and when he visits, realizes the Minin not only keeps the institute supplied, but finds ways to help the villagers too. He also has all the records for the village, going back for many years, including reports of other deaths. Minin sends the Doctor to see Catherine about a microscope. Catherine helps the Doctor prepare a slide from the sliver of rock that he brought. When they look at it, it resembles a printed circuit, rather than the granite and quartz stone everyone assumed they were. The Doctor looks at the sample for a long time, then asks for a different one. As Catherine is removing the sliver with tweezers, it falls and she picks it up with her fingers. It turns her fingertips numb, and makes them wrinkled and old looking. The Doctor drops it on his palm, and it does the same to his hand. His skin recovers almost instantly when the sliver is removed, and he tells her that hers will recover in a day or two. He wonders aloud why the energy absorption is tuned to just one strain of DNA life force (noting that he isn't 'close enough'). Meanwhile, Jack and the soldiers have taken Valeria home, and are now checking the submarine pens for radiation. At the inn, Rose is told that she should visit Georgi, an old blind man who 'sees things.' He tells Rose that a man with a wolf on his arm will kill him. And then he tells her that there is something in the water, and soldiers on the quay. He 'sees' something with tentacles slither out and kill Nikolai as he goes back to the generator. The lights go out just as Georgi 'sees' Nikolai die. Rose runs back to the inn to get Sofia, and they both go out to the quay to look for Nikolai. They find him dead, and Jack comes running when he hears her scream. The soldiers try to use their radios, but get nothing but static. One of them says he can fix the generator, and Jack and Sergeyev go with him. Sofia decides that she needs to look at the stone circle again, and Rose comes along. Jack and the soldiers get the generator repaired, but before they can leave the ship, one of the blue slithery jellyfish creatures comes on board the sub. They are about to climb the ladder and get out, when another shows up. They hide under panels in the floor, and one soldier is found. Jack has Sergeyev hide in a cabin, while he draws the creatures off. He ends up in the torpedo room. At the stone circle, Sofia says something about systems starting up on their own, which means the stones will always be active, and then she grabs Rose and tries to force her to touch a stone. Rose manages to twist away, and Sofia falls against the stone instead, and becomes very old. Rose runs for the car, and manages to evade Sofia. Rose drives to the village, and goes to Sofia's home. She finds a chair in the spare bedroom, with pipes and tubes running into the floor and a headpiece above it. She goes back downstairs, following the pipes, and finds a door. She hears Barinska come in, and sees her go to the upstairs spare room, sit on the chair and become young again. Rose figures out how to open the downstairs door, and finds herself on a set of steps leading down to a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel is a hatch leading into a spaceship. There is another hatch on the other side of the huge room, leading to another tunnel that ends at the sea. She sees a shape coming out of the water, and recognises Jack. She gives him her coat, and they go back into the ship. Jack realises it must be where the signal was coming from. In the ship, the bodies underneath the sheets are part human, part animal. Sofia opens the hatch and enters the ship. Just as she attacks Rose with a knife, Jack shoots her, then twice more before he grabs Rose's hand and takes her out the door toward the ocean. Just outside the door is a flight of steps. At the top is a door that is blocked by boxes. Someone starts moving them while the two of them shove, and the Doctor and Minin are on the other side. Jack and Rose take the Doctor down to the ship. He says that the pilot was probably killed when it crashed, but auto-repair fixed the ship. But since nothing happened, the ship still thinks there's something wrong, so it's sending out the signal. It should just collect wind and heat and other energy, but someone tampered with it and now it only takes the life force from humans. The system is really going crazy now, because the ship thinks it's about to be rescued. The only way to stop the process is to drain the power down completely. Barinska surprises them in the ship. Levin and his men also enter the ship, and she is shot several times. The Doctor leaves through the door leading to her house, and she follows. The Doctor is hoping to get a look at the equipment in her house, but she is following too close, so he runs toward the harbour. He hides, but one of the blue creatures appears, and grabs him. Once again, the ship decides he doesn't like him after all and lets go, and so the creature grabs Barinska instead. The Doctor, Jack, Rose, Levin and the soldiers go to the inn, where the Doctor tells them (and the villagers still there) about what's going on. As they are discussing what to do, Georgi stumbles in, telling them that the blue creatures are coming to get them. The Doctor says that the ship probably uses a psychic wavelength to communicate with the remotes, and that Georgi might be picking up on it. The Doctor thinks that if that is the case, perhaps Georgi can also send different instructions. Suddenly, the remotes attack the inn. The villagers, Jack, Rose, Levin and the Doctor manage to escape, and Levin orders the soldiers to go door to door, warn as many of the villagers as they can, and have everyone head for the institute. As the Doctor and Rose head up the hill, Georgi tells Rose 'Don't let him kill me' and when she asks who, he says 'The bad wolf.' Once at the institute, the soldiers and the fittest of the villagers start to build a bonfire to block the road. Jack suddenly realises Valeria, whom he has been insistent upon protecting, is not with the procession. Her father, Mamentov, does not care for her at all and has left her behind. Jack perilously runs back to the house, and narrowly rescues her from the blue 'blob' creatures. On the way, he meets with Sergeyev, who has escaped from the submarine. Despite their mutual dislike from the start, Sergeyev saves Jack, and dies saving him and Valeria. Klebanov suggest that the Doctor take Georgi to the Clean Room, which is a glass cage in a large bare room. The glass is bullet- and blast-proof, and there is an electronic locking system on both of the double doors. It used to be the room where they worked with contagious bacteria. The Doctor seats him in a chair, talks to him quietly, and then puts his fingers to Georgi's temples and puts him into a trance. Rose volunteers to stay with him, but the Doctor asks Minin to stay instead. He asks for the number, so he can call to give new instructions. None of the other phones are working, but Rose's super phone will. The pile for the bonfire is quite high, and the Doctor tells them to go ahead and light it. The idea is that Georgi is hacked into the system, and can tell the creatures to head straight for the flames, which won't kill them, but will stop them. As Rose and the Doctor watch the flames, she sees that some are coming around the sides, and the Doctor says that either Georgi isn't succeeding, or Barinska wasn't alone. The Doctor calls Minin and tells him to stop Georgi. When the Doctor gets to the room, he finds Minin trying to get in the glass cage, but manages to trap himself in the space between the two doors, with no way back to the Doctor, and unable to get through to Georgi. The Doctor tries to use the sonic screwdriver, but it melts the keypad. They manage to rip it out, but the inner door only opens a few inches and then jams. Minin tries to fire a warning shot, or just wound him, but ends up shooting a canister of deadly gas behind Georgi. The old man is killed, and the gas is seeping towards Minin who is trapped. The father of Pavel Vahlen (the boy who was killed at the start) brings his toolbox and reluctantly helps Minin out of the Clean Room. Most of the creatures are coming around the flames, so everyone retreats into the building, and then barricades all the doors and windows. The Doctor tells them that Plan B is stop the ship, but when they open the hidden door in the storeroom, a creature is on the other side. So they have to create Plan C. They go back to Minin's office to look at plans for the building. The Doctor points out that all the offices are around the outside of the building, but there is nothing in the center. It's not a covered courtyard, because there are wires and pipes leading inside. They decide to find a way in, as it might be the best place to defend themselves. Klebanov says that the space was the main lab, and that it was sealed off in the 1950s because of an accident. But they decide to blow a hole in the wall anyway, since they don't have much chance if they don't. The Doctor tells Rose and Jack that the room is safe, because the air conditioning is still connected, so there was never a toxin or a leak. They blow a hole in the storeroom wall, which lets them into a corridor. They open the door to the lab, turn on the light, bring everyone in, then barricade the door. Inside are skeletal grey figures in lab coats, that begin to move. And then they realise that Klebanov was also working with Barinska. The Doctor glanced at Jack (to let him know he needed to get working on Plan D), and then keeps Klebanov talking. As the creatures break down the door, the scientists try to drive the villagers toward them, and Jack and one of the soldiers - Lieutenant Krylek - blew a hole in the wall. The Doctor takes the villagers down to the (formerly) dry dock. However, Valeria is left behind, and Jack shouts for Rose to bring her with them. Jack and the soldiers try to keep the scientists at bay, but bullets don't have much effect - only slow them down. Then they suddenly slip away, leaving the soldiers trapped with the blue blobs. The soldiers blow a hole in another wall and escape. Most of the village's fuel is at the dry dock. They spread it over the ground, planning to light it as soon as the blob creatures get there. The scientists plan to detonate missiles left on the subs, in order to power up the ship and make all of them young and healthy again. Rose, who has been tailing the group who have taken Valeria as hostage, follows them down the cliffs, and then into a sub. The Doctor said he was going for a swim, and then reappeared, telling them to be sure to keep a couple of blue blob creatures alive. He says he has been to the ship, and after the majority of the blobs are burned, he wants Jack to run back to the lab with the remaining blobs following. Jack tells him that the scientists are on one of the subs, but all the missiles have been decommissioned - by Klebanov. The Doctor goes down to the sub with the scientists and Rose, and opens the secondary hatch. He finds Rose, and tells the pursuing Klebanov that it won't work. Just as they are ready to launch a missile, there is a klaxon and a systems failure. The Doctor tells them that he moved the refueling hose to the seawater intake. Jack gets the blue blobs up to the lab, where they sensed a larger power source and go after it instead of him. Then he runs back to the docks. He bursts into the sub as the klaxon sounds, just in time to see all the scientists sink and lose all their energy. The ship is caught in a loop, and its power is draining away.

It is approximately in length, an average of deep but at its deepest point, and covers an area of . It is rumored to be home to a legendary lake monster that locals fondly refer to as ‚ÄúMussie‚Äù. The lake currently has over 300 lakefront properties and two privately owned campgrounds surrounding its shores. The town of Cobden is the largest settlement on the lake, with a population slightly over 1,000 people.  Geology  Like many other lakes in the Ottawa Valley, Muskrat Lake was formed roughly 10,000 years ago when the glaciers of the last ice age receded. At that point it was part of the much larger Champlain Sea. About 6,000 years ago, water levels dropped and the Champlain Sea receded, leaving behind what we know presently as Muskrat Lake and its surrounding tributaries. Three major tributaries contribute to the inflow of water into Muskrat Lake. These include the Muskrat River and Buttermilk Creek from the east and the Snake River from the south. Muskrat Lake drains into Muskrat River (at the western point of the lake) where it continues north towards Pembroke, Ontario and drains into the Ottawa River.  History  = Samuel de Champlain 1613 Expedition = The Muskrat Lake region was originally inhabited by the Algonquin people. The first European explorer to discover Muskrat Lake and its surrounding area was Samuel de Champlain on June 7, 1613. At the time, Champlain was exploring the possibility of an alternative route to the Northern Sea (Hudson Bay) that would bypass the treacherous rapids along the Ottawa River. During his expedition in 1613, Champlain came upon a group of Algonquins led by Nibachis, close to the shores of a lake that Champlain named Lac De Nibachis (now modern day Muskrat Lake). After supplying Champlain with guides, Nibachis sent Champlain and his men seven leagues down the lake by canoe. According to Champlain's records, the adventurers then portaged one league to modern day Lower Allumette Lake to meet with Chief Tesso·Ωíat on what historians conclude to be Morrison Island. = The Astrolabe = During his 1613 expedition from the Ottawa River to the North Sea, Champlain lost his astrolabe. More than 200 years later in 1867, the astrolabe was discovered by a 15-year-old boy named Edward G. Lee who was helping his father clear land on lot 13, concession 2, Ross Township. Currently, a local resort called Logos Land, just east of Cobden, is situated on part of this land. In 1943, the astrolabe was acquired by the New York Historian Society and later returned to Canada when purchased by the Canadian Government in 1989 for $250,000. The astrolabe is currently displayed at the Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. A stone monument commemorating the discovery was erected near Logos Land in 1952. = Ferries and Forwarding Services on Muskrat Lake = In 1837, explorer David Thompson set out to mark a route for a proposed canal from the Ottawa River to Georgian Bay. The canal was to travel up Muskrat River and through Muskrat Lake, but never materialized. Thwarted by lack of supplies, Thompson never completed his survey. In 1848, Jason Gould (1802-1864) decided to create a forwarding line from Portage Du Fort on the Ottawa River to Pembroke, Ontario. This route included a ferrying service across Muskrat Lake and up part of the Muskrat River to Jackson's Grove, just outside of Pembroke. This route was considered shorter with more favorable terrain than the route currently being taken along the Ottawa River. The original ferries were flat-bottomed row boats that required the passengers to paddle them. Muskrat Lake's first steamboat, The Muskrat, was created to meet the growing demand for simpler transportation across the lake and was soon accompanied by the North Star in the spring of 1853. The North Star was reported to be over 90 feet in length and able to ‚Äú‚Ä¶float on heavy dew‚Äù. On May 16, 1853 a great forest fire burned from Pembroke to Horton, Ontario. Smoke from the fire was reported to cause discomfort to residents as far as Bytown and Perth. The fire consumed almost everything in its path, including Jason Gould's wharf on Muskrat Lake, his storehouses, and The Muskrat. The North Star managed to survive the fire on the happenstance that it was out on the water returning from a trip to Pembroke that morning. In 1860, Jason Gould sold his business to the Union Forwarding Co. which was principally owned by Daniel Crowley (the former captain of the North Star). In 1863, Crowley built a new ferry and named it the Jason Gould. The ferrying service on Muskrat Lake came to an end with the arrival of the railroad in Cobden during 1876. In 1965, two scuba divers, Kim Charlebois, 28, and Jack Tremblay, 26, from the Underwater Society of Ottawa came across the burnt remains of the ferry The Muskrat a few feet off the shores of Muskrat Lake. The scuba divers were reported to bring up pieces of timber, iron fittings and a number of bottles, two of them still corked. = Community Involvement on the Lake = From its original inhabitants, the Algonquins, to the arrival of European settlers, Muskrat Lake has proven to be an important resource for its surrounding inhabitants. In 1865, children attending Cobden's Elementary School would skate or travel by row boat across Muskrat Lake each day to get to school. Cobden's Women's Institute held a picnic on the shores of Muskrat Lake in 1912 featuring a steamboat ferry ride across the lake. In the same year, local resident, Peter Pappin caught a 65 lb lake sturgeon on Muskrat Lake. On September 1961, Premier Frost arrived via float plane on Muskrat Lake to officially open the reconstructed Cobden Memorial Hall. To date there has been only two people recorded to have made the swim across Muskrat Lake, Lawrence Dack in June, 1923, and Sarah Hall on June 17, 2017. Since 2010, The Cobden Civitan Club has used the lake every winter to host the Cobden Ice Fishing Derby on Muskrat Lake. On February 1, 2020 the derby saw over 1,500 participants.  Ecosystem  Muskrat Lake is home to a diverse terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. Muskrat Lake is popular year round among bird watchers, outdoor enthusiast, anglers, and duck hunters. Each year the lake hosts multiple fishing derbies. The lake itself is known for its large array of fresh water fish species, such as lake sturgeon, walleye, lake trout, pike, bass, catfish and longnose gar. The municipal dock, located at the east end of the lake, is a regular meeting spot for bird watchers who have caught sight of Franklin's gull among other birds.  Environment Issues  = Nutrient loading = Over the past several decades Muskrat Lake has seen a serious and significant decline in water quality, most specifically related to nutrient loading. Declining water quality on Muskrat Lake has resulted in negative impacts to shoreline property owners, recreational users, residential development, the tourism industry, fish species and aquatic habitat, and has generated public health concerns related to blue-green algae. = Blue-green algae = One of the more serious side effects of nutrient loading in Muskrat Lake is the proliferation of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) blooms. As blue- green algae blooms decay they release toxins into the surrounding freshwater environment, which can be harmful to humans, pets, livestock, fish, and other wildlife. Muskrat Lake has seen an increase in the frequency and severity of blue-green algae blooms in recent years. From 2007-2013 blue-green algae blooms were confirmed three times by the Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks.

It was published on 8 September 2005, alongside The Deviant Strain and The Stealers of Dreams. It features the Ninth Doctor, Rose Tyler and Captain Jack. Synopsis The presence of a Neanderthal on present-day Earth alerts the Doctor, Rose and Jack to the fact that someone is meddling with time. In order to learn the truth, they must travel back 28,000 years, where they meet humans of the past and future ‚Äî and something far, far worse. Plot At a fancy dress party in Bromley, a young Roman starts a fight with a caveman. Meanwhile, on the TARDIS, the Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack Harkness are setting off to Kegron Pluva. Explaining that it is a \\"dirty rip engine\\" that is causing the disturbance, the Doctor pilots the TARDIS to Bromley in the early 21st century. The TARDIS lands, and the Doctor and Jack attempt to trace the disturbance. Rose goes across the street to a manicure shop and finds out that a fight at a nightclub resulted in a caveman being taken to hospital. Upon arriving at the hospital, the trio soon realize that the army has closed it off. The Doctor and Rose go into the hospital. Inside, a nurse explains that someone was brought in the night before with the Ebola virus. After finding the room with the Neanderthal, the Doctor explains that he is Dr Table and that he is an expert in acromegaly. With the help of the patient's nurse Weronika, they get the Neanderthal out of the hospital and into the TARDIS. The Neanderthal gives his name as Das, and the Doctor asks him how he came to be in this time period. From his explanation, they realize the dirty rip engine is from time travelers visiting in 29,185 BC. As the TARDIS leaves, Das starts to dissolve in a green pool of light. The TARDIS shudders and shrieks, but manages to reverse, and the Doctor says the original time trip has polluted Das's cell structure, and he cannot go home. The Doctor and Rose go back in time to figure out what's going on. He's rented an apartment for them, gives Jack a psychic credit card, and says they'll be back in a month. The TARDIS lands on a plain, with forest nearby. They head into the trees. They see a good-looking young man eating lunch, but when they head toward him, he runs off. While tracking him, they suddenly end up in the remains of a large animal, and hear noises from whatever killed it heading their way. Suddenly, loud thumping music screeches out, and the predator runs off. The noise came from two more time travellers, who are unsurprised to see the Doctor and Rose. The two men are dressed like the man they were tracking, are also very good- looking, and both wearing name badges. Rose realizes that they seem very 'blank' and show very little emotion. The two men take them Das's squeaky tree, which is a lift that goes to a huge cave containing a wooden city called Osterberg. As they go to meet Chantal, Rose notices that everyone is movie- premiere attractive, except for one man who looks normal and is dressed very eccentrically with a broad brimmed hat and a cape. Chantal is very tall, and incredibly beautiful. She is talking to the man in the hat, who is called Quilley. He is complaining about the experiment being on day forty-nine when it was only planned for forty. Chantal recommends he use combo 662 to stop worrying, and Quilley says he doesn't want it. The Doctor introduces himself and Rose, and while he stays to talk to Chantal, Rose goes with Quilley to talk about 'zoo-tech.' Chantal has Lene show the Doctor around Osterberg. The Doctor decides to see if he can break through the universal indifference show by the Osterbergers by asking Lene to pretend that he knows nothing about the city or why they are there. She looks irritated for a moment, then taps the keypad on her badge and is wildly enthusiastic about explaining it all to him. She tells him that Chantal is the boss, and came up with the idea of traveling to the past. Everything that the team does is for her. The Doctor arrives at Quilley's home, and explains that he's worked it out. The Osterbergers come from a time after AD 436,000, when a massive space battle caused Earth to be hit with an EMP-like wave, knocking out all electronics and stopping progress in its tracks. Humanity was forced to focus on non-electronic fields of science, like chemistry and biology. Eventually, the advances in the two fields allowed humans to fully map out the human body. In essence, doctors will act like mechanics - taking people apart and putting them back together with no ill effects. The Doctor shows Rose one of the badges, and tells her that they use pharmacology to block any 'wrong-feeling.' Quilley is a Refuser, and won't use the popper packs. The Doctor asks Quilley to show them the time machine that they came in. It runs on steam, and the Doctor wants to check it out thoroughly, so he tells Rose she should investigate the creature they encountered earlier. Quilley tells her that Reddy is going out to visit the Neanderthals, and she could go out with him. She starts to ask if he will care, then realizes he'll just say 'Yeah, fine, whatever' and not ask any questions. When they enter the Neanderthal camp, Reddy (who is the first man seen by Rose and the Doctor) is greeted by a female named Ka. Rose tells them that Das is OK, which they are relieved and happy to know, but that he won't be coming back. Suddenly, there is a great commotion as a band of human cavemen in skins and blue paint attack the village and takes Rose prisoner. The Doctor finishes his examination of the engine, and tells Quilley that something is bleeding power off it. They trace the pipe to the 'Grey Door' and go to see what it is. It has a huge locking mechanism, and the Doctor starts to open it with his sonic screwdriver. They hear a voice from the inside, that Quilley identifies as an Osterberger named Tina. The door opens, and at first there is nothing, then a skeleton wearing Tina's name badge is thrown out. The Doctor starts to shut the door, but a grey six-fingered had emerges and pushes back. A tall creature looking vaguely humanoid wearing a suit jumps out and asks if they are human. The Doctor says of course not, and orders the creature back inside. He manages to intimidate it and relock the door. The Doctor tells Quilley that the creature is a product of genetic engineering, created by someone in Osterberg. As they walk away, they see Chantal approaching with two other Osterbergers. She tells him the creature is called a Hy-Bractor, and the Doctor calls her its mother. She is holding a remote control, which she uses to make the two people with her attack the Doctor and Quilley. They are clubbed unconscious, and the Doctor awakens in Chantal's lab, drugged with a popper pack. Rose wakes up to see an old woman and her son. She gives them her name, and tells them she comes from 'nearer the river.' The woman tells Rose that they have decided she's going to join the family and marry her grandson, which would make her a queen. Rose tries to tell them that she doesn't want to marry Tillun, but her objections are brushed off. She finally tells them that she has to go out alone and appease her tribe's god before the wedding, and walks out of camp. Even though Chantal has given the Doctor twice the normal dosage of chemicals, he manages to fight them off well enough to tie her to a chair and then go to find Quilley. He rips off his and Quilley's popper packs, and goes to look for an antidote. While looking in the supply centre, he realizes that the popper pack refills are almost gone. Chantal is freed by one of the Osterbergers, who she takes to the Grey Door and feeds to the Hy- Bractor. She then sets all four of them free to eat the rest of the humans, with the exceptions of each other, the Doctor, and herself. The Doctor hears the screams, and provokes Quilley enough to overcome some of the effect. He tells him to save as many of the Osterbergers as he can. Then the Doctor goes to warn the Neanderthals and other people on the surface, and to find Rose. Quilley does his best to motivate the Osterbergers, but is only able to escape with two other people. They take the lift to the surface while the Hy-Bractors eat everyone else. Away from the tribe, Rose realizes she has no idea how to find her way back to the Neanderthals. She has been followed by Tillun, who wants to know why she won't marry him. As she tries to explain, they hear hoofbeats and hide. The bushes are parted, and the Doctor is there. He used the psychic paper (which also does pictures) to tame the horse. The Doctor tries to tell the Family that they must hide deep in the cave, but they won't believe him because he is a man and an outsider. Rose asks if they will believe her if she joins the Family, and is told that they will. So Rose agrees to marry Tillun. As soon as the ceremony finishes, she orders them to hide. Tillun tries to make her stay, but the Doctor knocks him down and they leave on the horse. The Doctor and Rose find the Neanderthal camp site, but there are only four of them left alive - the rest have been killed by the Hy- Bractors. Chantal walks into the clearing and they are both captured. The Doctor again awakes in Chantal's lab, where she has also brought the TARDIS. She tells the Doctor that it won't open for her, and then threatens Rose if he will not help her get inside. Between the two of them, they manage to capture Chantal and drug her with a double dose from a popper pack. The Doctor sets to work designing a way to defeat the Hy-Bractors, and runs outside to disperse it into the air. A Hy-Bractor who was still in Osterberg enters the lab and frees Chantal. When it tries to eat Rose, she opens her mouth and breathes fire on it (the same thing happening to other Hy-Bractors on the surface). Chantal makes her way to the time travel machine, where she is found by the Doctor. He tells her not to enter the beam, but she does and is torn apart by the time winds. The Doctor realizes that the machine is going to blow up, and he and Rose take the TARDIS to the surface. They land near Quilley and the other two Osterbergers, but are then discovered by the remaining Hy-Bractor. The Doctor tells it that Chantal is dead, but that she asked him to tell it to eat anything except humans, and it believes him. Meanwhile, Jack is helping Das adjust to modern life. By the time the Doctor and Rose return, Das is sufficiently acclimated, has a job, and even finds a girlfriend who suits him. The novel ends with the TARDIS crew jumping forward several weeks to Das's wedding. Back in prehistoric time, Quilley marries Tillun's grandmother, with the remaining Neanderthals and last Hy-Bractor also living with the family. Continuity * The Doctor states he has met Neanderthals before, a reference to the Seventh Doctor serial, Ghost Light which depicted a Neanderthal living in 19th Century England, and possibly a reference to the First Doctor's story An Unearthly Child. * Jack indicates he has never visited Rose's time, which places this prior to the events of the televised episode \\"Boom Town\\". The preceding novel, The Deviant Strain, also take place before \\"Boom Town\\", but the following book, The Stealers of Dreams, takes place after the televised episode as it contains a reference to its events. * Rose finds talking to the prehistoric people very different from those in the more recent past, such as Gwyneth from \\"The Unquiet Dead\\", or even aliens on other planets, as it seems that certain concepts are just beyond their understanding. * The novel makes extensive use of the TARDIS' ability to translate foreign languages into English, as both Neanderthals and cavemen are shown speaking not only literate English, but with 21st-century vernacular as well, although at one point it is revealed that the TARDIS has a \\"swear filter\\" (as explained by the Doctor) which substitutes the word \\"blinking\\" instead of an obscenity spoken by Nan. * This book marks the first time that Jack has met Jackie Tyler (albeit briefly). He meets her again in \\"Journey's End\\". *There is no Bad Wolf reference in this book.This is stated on Doctor Who reference Guide References to popular culture * While with the Family, Rose comments that all the furs make it like \\"Julien Macdonald round here.\\" * The Doctor says that \\"Carry On Cleo was more historically accurate than anyone realised.\\" * The Doctor states that \\"marrying for love, it's overrated\\" and to Rose's response of \\"Like you'd know\\" says, \\"Who says I don't? Ask Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.\\" * While Chantal is expounding on her theories of evolution, Rose says, \\"This is turning into Horizon.\\" * The Doctor calls Tillun Aladdin Sane in reference to the 1973 David Bowie album. (Bowie on the cover has a stripe of face paint on much like Tillun) * Quilley has a Coldplay CD among his \\"ancient artifacts\\", and it seems the Doctor doesn't think very highly of the band. * While Jack allows Das to learn about the world by watching television, he feels that Farscape and Deadwood would only confuse a Neanderthal. * Das mentions his favourite show is Are You Being Served?, although did does not refer to it by name but instead calls the characters the \\"Grace Brothers\\". Jack also mentions that he has trouble explaining that 'Mrs Slocombe' is not real to Das.

The via Domitiana is not to be confused with the similar-sounding via Domitia in France.) Via Domiziana is the modern name for the Via Domitiana in the Campania region of Italy, a major Roman road built in 95 AD under (and named for) the emperor, Domitian, to facilitate access to and from the important ports of Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli) and Portus Julius (home port of the western Imperial fleet, consisting of the waters around Baiae and Cape Misenum) in the Gulf of Naples. The Via Domitiana was not built from scratch, but was based on an existing secondary road and used works undertaken in the Neronian period for the construction of the Fossa Neronis (the canal intended to connect Rome to Pozzuoli). The road left the Appian Way at Formiae or Sinuessa. It followed the coast and crossed the rivers Savona and Volturna,The remains of the Roman bridge on the Volturna, inserted in the mediaeval fortress, are still visible in Castel Volturno passed through an area of coastal lagoons by Linterne and Cumae and ended in Pozzuoli. In 102 Trajan extended the Via Domitiana to Naples. It was damaged by Alaric in 420 AD and ultimately destroyed by Gaiseric in 455 AD. It was partially restored under various rulers of the Kingdom of Naples in the Middle Ages and in its modern guise is a major coast road leading north from Naples. Statius wrote an entire poem on the theme of Via Domitiana.Statius: Silvae , IV, 3 He recalled the progress made by the new road and praised the Emperor.

He held this post until December 1944, when he was placed in command of the IJN 2nd Fleet based on the Inland Sea. In early April 1945, Ito commanded the last major offensive by the Imperial Japanese Navy when he led the battleship on its final sortie accompanied by the light cruiser Yahagi and eight destroyers in Operation Ten-Go, which aimed to destroy US naval forces during the Battle of Okinawa. It≈ç initially opposed the mission, which he viewed as futile and wasteful, but ultimately relented, after being informed that the Emperor was expecting the Navy to mount some kind of attack. On April 7, the Japanese ships were spotted heading for Okinawa and were subsequently attacked by several hundred American carrier aircraft. With no Japanese air support available, the Yamato and several of its escorts were overwhelmed and sunk by multiple bomb and torpedo hits. After ordering the mission cancelled and for the remaining escorts to rescue survivors, It≈ç chose to go down with the Yamato.Hara, Japanese Destroyer Captain It≈ç was posthumously promoted to full admiral.

Life  Uuen was a son of Onuist II [son of] Uurguist [Wrguist] (in Gaelic: √ìengus II mac Fergusa, died 834) and succeeded his cousin Drest mac Caustant√≠n as king in 836 or 837. The sole notice of Uuen in the Irish annals is the report of his death, together with his brother Bran and \\"√Åed mac Boanta, and others almost innumerable\\" in a battle fought by the men of Fortriu against Vikings in 839.Reported in the Annals of Ulster, s.a. 839. This defeat appears to have ended the century-long domination of Pictland by the descendants of Onuist I [son of] Wrguist (in Gaelic: √ìengus I mac Fergusa).Broun, \\"Pictish Kings\\", p. 75.; Clancy, \\"Caustant√≠n\\"; Smyth, pp. 180-181. If the annalistic record is short, there are other traditions relating to Uuen. He is named by the St Andrews foundation tale as one of the sons of Onuist who met with Saint Regulus at Forteviot when the Saint supposedly brought the relics of Saint Andrew to Scotland.Broun, \\"Pictish Kings\\", p. 81 and note 27. Along with his uncle Caustant√≠n, Uuen appears to have been a patron of the Northumbrian monasteries as he is named in the Liber Vitae Dunelmensis, which contains a list of those for whom prayers were said, dating from around 840.Forsyth, \\"Lost Pictish source\\", p. 25.

Antislavery campaigners, led by Frederick Douglass, during this period bitterly complained about what they saw as disproportionate and corrupt influence wielded by wealthy Southerners. The argument was that this small group of rich slave owners had seized political control of their own states and were trying to take over the federal government in an illegitimate fashion in order to expand and protect slavery. The argument was later widely used by the Republican Party that formed in 1854‚Äì55 to oppose the expansion of slavery. The main issue expressed by the term slave power was distrust of the political power of the slave-owning class. Such distrust was shared by many who were not abolitionists; those who were motivated more by a possible threat to the political balance or the impossibility of competing with unwaged slave labor, than by concern over the treatment of slaves. Those who differed on many other issues (such as hating blacks or liking them, denouncing slavery as a sin or promising to guarantee its protection in the Deep South) could unite to attack the slavocracy.Leonard L. Richards, Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780‚Äì1860 (2000) p. 3) The \\"Free Soil\\" element emphasized that rich slave owners would move into new territory, use their cash to buy up all the good lands, then use their slaves to work the lands, leaving little opportunity room for free farmers. By 1854 the Free Soil Party had largely merged into the new Republican Party.Eric Foner, Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War (1970), pp. 73‚Äì102 The term was popularized by antislavery writers such as Frederick Douglass, John Gorham Palfrey, Josiah Quincy III, Horace Bushnell, James Shepherd Pike, and Horace Greeley. Politicians who emphasized the theme included John Quincy Adams, Henry Wilson and William Pitt Fessenden. Abraham Lincoln used the concept after 1854 but not the term. They showed, through a combination of emotive argument and hard statistical data, that the South had long held a disproportionate level of power in the United States. Historian Allan Nevins contends that \\"nearly all groups ... steadily substituted emotion for reason. ... Fear fed hatred, and hatred fed fear.\\"Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: Fruits of Manifest Destiny, 1847‚Äì1852 (1947) p. ix The existence of a Slave Power was dismissed by Southerners at the time, and rejected as false by many historians of the 1920s and 1930s, who stressed the internal divisions in the South before 1850.See Chauncey S. Boucher, \\"In Re That Aggressive Slavocracy,\\" The Mississippi Valley Historical Review Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (Jun., 1921), pp. 13‚Äì79; Craven (1936) The idea that the Slave Power existed has partly come back at the hands of neoabolitionist historians since 1970, and there is no doubt that it was a powerful factor in the Northern anti-slavery belief system. It was standard rhetoric for all factions of the Republican Party.Foner, Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men p. 9 Background Massachusetts, Wooster Republican, February 2, 1859 (Reproduction)The problem posed by slavery, according to many Northern politicians, was not so much the mistreatment of slaves (a theme that abolitionists emphasized), but rather the political threat to American republicanism, especially as embraced in Northern free states. The Free Soil Party first raised this warning in 1848, arguing that the annexation of Texas as a slave state was a terrible mistake. The Free Soilers' rhetoric was taken up by the Republican party as it emerged in 1854. The Republicans also argued that slavery was economically inefficient, compared to free labor, and was a deterrent to the long-term modernization of America. Worse, said the Republicans, the Slave Power, deeply entrenched in the South, was systematically seizing control of the White House, the Congress, and the Supreme Court. Senator and governor Salmon P. Chase of Ohio was an articulate enemy of the Slave Power, as was Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. Southern power Southern power derived from a combination of factors. The \\"three-fifths clause\\" (counting 100 slaves as 60 people for seats in the House and thus for electoral votes) gave the South disproportionate representation at the national level.Garry Wills, \\"Negro President\\": Jefferson and the Slave Power, (2005) Parity in the Senate was critical, whereby a new slave state was admitted in tandem with a new free state. Regional unity across party lines was essential on key votes. In the Democratic party, a presidential candidate had to carry the national convention by a two-thirds vote to get nominated. It was also essential for some Northerners‚Äî\\"Doughfaces\\"Most Doughfaces were Jacksonian Democrats like Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan; few were Whigs.‚Äîto collaborate with the South, as in the debates surrounding the three-fifths clause itself in 1787, the Missouri Compromise of 1820, the gag rule in the House (1836‚Äì1844), and the wider subject of the Wilmot Proviso and slavery expansion in the Southwest after the Mexican war of 1846‚Äì1848.Richards (2000) However, the North was adding population‚Äîand House seats‚Äîmuch faster than the South, so the handwriting was on the wall. With the implacable Republicans gaining every year, the secession option became more and more attractive to the South. Secession was suicidal, as some leaders realized, and as John Quincy Adams had long prophesied. Secession, argued James Henry Hammond of South Carolina, reminded him of \\"the Japanese who when insulted rip open their own bowels.\\" And yet when secession came in 1860 Hammond followed. Historian Leonard Richards concludes, \\"It was men like Hammond who finally destroyed the Slave Power. Thanks to their leading the South out of the Union, seventy-two years of slaveholder domination came to an end.\\"Richards (2000) pp. 214‚Äì15. Threat to republicanism From the point of view of many Northerners, the supposedly definitive Compromise of 1850 was followed by a series of maneuvers (such as the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act, the Dred Scott decision, etc.) in which the North gave up previously-agreed gains without receiving anything in return, accompanied by ever-escalating and more extreme Southern demands. Many northerners who had no particular concern for blacks concluded that slavery was not worth preserving if its protection required destroying or seriously compromising democracy among whites. Such perceptions led to the Anti-Nebraska movement of 1854‚Äì1855, followed by the organized Republican Party. Opponents Historian Frederick J. Blue (2006) explores the motives and actions of those who played supportive but not central roles in antislavery politics‚Äîthose who undertook the humdrum work of organizing local parties, holding conventions, editing newspapers, and generally animating and agitating the discussion of issues related to slavery. They were a small but critical number of voices who, beginning in the late 1830s, battled the institution of slavery through political activism. In the face of great odds and powerful opposition, activists insisted that emancipation and racial equality could only be achieved through the political process. Representative activists include: Alvan Stewart, a Liberty party organizer from New York; John Greenleaf Whittier, a Massachusetts poet, journalist, and Liberty activist; Charles Henry Langston, an Ohio African-American educator; Owen Lovejoy, a congressman from Illinois, whose brother Elijah was killed by a pro-slavery mob; Sherman Booth, a journalist and Liberty organizer in Wisconsin; Jane Grey Swisshelm, a journalist in Pennsylvania and Minnesota; George W. Julian, a congressman from Indiana; David Wilmot, a congressman from Pennsylvania, whose Wilmot proviso tried to stop the expansion of slavery in the Southwest; Benjamin Wade and Edward Wade, a senator and a congressman, respectively, from Ohio; and Jessie Benton Fr√©mont of Missouri and California, wife of the Republican 1856 presidential nominee John C. Fr√©mont.See Blue (2006) Impact of Democratic Free Soilers The Democrats who rallied to Martin Van Buren's Free Soil Party in 1848 have been studied by Earle (2003). Their views on race occupied a wide spectrum, but they were able to fashion new and vital arguments against slavery and its expansion based on the Jacksonian Democracy's long-standing commitment to egalitarianism and hostility to centralized power. Linking their antislavery stance to a land-reform agenda that pressed for free land for poor settlers‚Äîrealized by the Homestead Law of 1862‚Äîin addition to land free of slavery, Free Soil Democrats forced major political realignments in New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Ohio. Democratic politicians such as Wilmot, Marcus Morton, John Parker Hale, and even former president Van Buren were transformed into antislavery leaders. Many entered the new Republican party after 1854, bringing along Jacksonian ideas about property and political equality, helping transform antislavery from a struggling crusade into a mass political movement that came to power in 1860.See Earle (2003) House divided In his celebrated \\"House Divided\\" speech of June 1858, Abraham Lincoln charged that Senator Stephen A. Douglas, President James Buchanan, his predecessor, Franklin Pierce, and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney were all part of a plot to nationalize slavery, as allegedly proven by the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision of 1857. Other Republicans pointed to the violence in Kansas, the brutal assault on Senator Sumner, attacks upon the abolitionist press, and efforts to take over Cuba (Ostend Manifesto) as evidence that the Slave Power was violent, aggressive, and expansive. The only solution, Republicans insisted, was a new commitment to free labor, and a deliberate effort to stop any more territorial expansion of slavery. Northern Democrats answered that it was all an exaggeration and that the Republicans were paranoid. Their Southern colleagues spoke of secession, arguing that the John Brown raid of 1859 proved that the Republicans were ready to attack their region and destroy their way of life. In congratulating President-elect Lincoln in 1860, Salmon P. Chase exclaimed, \\"The object of my wishes and labors for nineteen years is accomplished in the overthrow of the Slave Power\\", adding that the way was now clear \\"for the establishment of the policy of Freedom\\"‚Äîsomething that would come only after four destructive years of Civil War. =Cult of domesticity= Jessie Fremont, the wife of the first Republican presidential candidate, wrote campaign poetry for the 1856 election. Grant says her poems bind the period's cult of domesticity to the new party's emerging ideology. Her poems suggested that Northerners who conciliated the Slave Power were spreading their own sterility, while virile men voting Republican were reproducing, through their own redemption, a future free West. The code of domesticity, according to Grant, thus helped these poems to define collective political action as building upon the strengths of free labor.David Grant, \\"'Our Nation's Hope Is She': The Cult of Jessie Fremont in the Republican Campaign Poetry of 1856,\\" Journal of American Studies, Aug 2008, 42#2, pp. 187‚Äì213 =Centralization= Historian Henry Brooks Adams (grandson of \\"Slave-Power\\" theorist John Quincy Adams) explained that the Slave Power was a force for centralization:Henry Adams, John Randolph (1882) pp. 178‚Äì79 > Between the slave power and states' rights there was no necessary > connection. The slave power, when in control, was a centralizing influence, > and all the most considerable encroachments on states' rights were its acts. > The acquisition and admission of Louisiana; the Embargo; the War of 1812; > the annexation of Texas \\"by joint resolution\\" [rather than treaty]; the war > with Mexico, declared by the mere announcement of President Polk; the > Fugitive Slave Law; the Dred Scott decision‚Äîall triumphs of the slave > power‚Äîdid far more than either tariffs or internal improvements, which in > their origin were also Southern measures, to destroy the very memory of > states' rights as they existed in 1789.

Very little is recorded of Conall. He is mentioned twice by the Irish annals, the most reliable source for the history of northern Britain in the years around 800. He also appears in later king lists. Annals The Chronicle of Ireland survives only in later manuscripts. Of these, the Annals of Ulster contain two reports of Conall. The first, dated to 789, records \\"a battle between the Picts, in which Conall son of Tadc was defeated and escaped; and Constant√≠n was victor\\". Constant√≠n here is Caustant√≠n mac Fergusa (d. 820), king of Fortriu. The second, in 807, reports \\"the killing of Conall son of Tadc, by Conall son of Aedac√°n in Cenn T√≠re\\". Cenn T√≠re is the Old Irish language form of Kintyre and Conall son of Aedac√°n is usually called Conall mac √Åed√°in. King lists Later evidence is provided by king lists and by Irish historical writings. The earliest of these may have been compiled during the ninth century, but none survives a manuscript of that date. A list of synchronisms--i.e., a series of known, datable events used to align Irish lists of kings to Scottish ones--was attributed to an Irish writer called Flann Mainistrech (Flann of Monasterboice) (d. 1056) in the eleventh century and provides another list of kings. Two manuscripts of Flann's work state that there were \\"sixteen kings in Scotland\\" between the death of √Åed All√°n (d. 743) and the death of √Åed Findliath (d. 789). These sixteen begin with D√∫ngal mac Selbaig and end with Kenneth MacAlpin. Two kings named Conall, \\"Conall Coem, and another Conall, his brother\\", are said to have reigned between Domnall mac Caustant√≠n and his father, Caustant√≠n mac Fergusa, the same king of Fortriu who had defeated Conall in 789. The Duan Albanach, dated on internal evidence to rather later in the eleventh century, follows this by having Domnall followed by two Conalls and then Caustant√≠n. It is generally assumed that the Duan and Flann aim to report the succession of kings in D√°l Riata. Conall is not included in any surviving genealogical material, but this is typical for the period. The Poppleton Manuscript Pictish king list includes a king named Canaul son of Tarla'a, son of Tang in some versions but simply omitted from others. This Canaul has generally been identified with Conall. The lists assign a reign of five years to this king who precedes Caustant√≠n mac Fergusa. King of Picts or D√°l Riata? Interpretations of the shadowy Conall mac Taidg are determined largely by the shifting views of historians with regard to Caustant√≠n mac Fergusa and the later origins of the Kingdom of Alba, a subject where the consensus may have changed twice in the last few decades having previously been stable since the time of William Forbes Skene. Skene made Conall a king of the Picts, later reinterpretations made him first a king of the Picts, then, following his expulsion by Caustant√≠n, a king in D√°l Riata. Recent reinterpretations make him a king in Argyll throughout, but not necessarily the chief king.

Like Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia, which documented the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Ichikawa's film was considered a milestone in documentary filmmaking. However, Tokyo Olympiad keeps its focus more on the atmosphere of the games and the human side of the athletes instead of concentrating on winning and the results. It is one of the few sports documentaries included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Production history The 1964 Summer Olympics were seen as vitally important to the Japanese government. Much of Japan's infrastructure had been destroyed during World War II and the Olympics were seen as a chance to re-introduce Japan to the world and show off its new modernised roads and industry as well as its burgeoning economy. Every Olympics since the first modern games in 1896 Summer Olympics had been committed to film to some extent or another, usually financed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for reasons of posterity. For the 1964 Olympics the Japanese government decided to finance their own film and initially hired Akira Kurosawa who, at the time, was the most famous Japanese director worldwide thanks to films such as Ikiru and Seven Samurai. However, Kurosawa's famous tendency for complete control - he demanded to not only direct the film but the opening and closing ceremonies as well - led to his dismissal. This led to the bringing in of Ichikawa, who had a reputation of coming into productions where events had not followed the initial plans. Controversy Ichikawa's vision of the Tokyo Olympics was controversial at the time as it was the opposite of what the Japanese government wanted and expected of the film. Ichikawa presented a film which was very much a cinematic and artistic recording of the events, more concerned with the athletes than the events, than the journalistic, historical recording that was desired by its financiers. As a result, the Japanese Olympic Committee forced Ichikawa to re-edit the picture to better suit their requirements, with the final, re-edited, version clocking in at 93 minutes rather than the original's 170 minutes. Release Tokyo Olympiad was released theatrically in Japan on 20 March 1965 where it was distributed by Toho. It had a 169-minute runtime that included an intermission. The film was released in the United States by American International Pictures, Pan-World Film Exchange and Jack Douglas Enterprises with an English narration. It was released on 20 October 1965 with a 93-minute runtime. The film was reissued in 1984 by Janus Films and Night Kitchen, Inc. with English subtitles at a 169-minute runtime. A 125-minute cut of the film is available on Youtube via the official Olympics channel. It is titled The Complete Tokyo 1964 Olympics Film despite being nearly an hour shorter than the original release. Reception The film initially had a distribution income of in Japanese theaters, where it drew 7.5million admissions. It was later screened in schools and public halls, drawing a further 16million admissions. This brought its total box office to 23.5million admissions, setting the record for the highest-grossing film in Japan in terms of box office admissions. Its record was later matched by Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Spirited Away (2001).Êó•Êú¨Êñ∞Ë®òÈå≤ÈÅîÊàê!„ÄåÂçÉ„Å®ÂçÉÂ∞ã„ÅÆÁ•ûÈö†„Åó„ÄçË®òËÄÖ‰ºöË¶ã, Toho, 2001-11-7ÔºàInternet ArchiveÔºâ The film is held in very high regard and is seen, alongside Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia, as one of the best films about the Olympics and one of the best sports documentaries of all time.

Construction began in 1879, Mossburn was reached in 1887, and the line closed in 1982. It was operated by the New Zealand Railways Department. Construction The line was intended to open up land to the west of Lumsden and perhaps even reach Manapouri or Te Anau in Fiordland. Construction began in July 1879 and the line left the Kingston Branch just outside the north side of Lumsden at a location named Mararoa Junction that was simply a set of points. The only real obstacle was the Oreti River, which was crossed by the end of March 1880, though an 1880 Royal Commission into New Zealand's railways was so unimpressed by the line's prospects that it declared \\"the railway bridge over the Oreti should be decked over and thrown open for dray traffic.\\" Nonetheless, construction progressed onwards towards Mossburn, albeit slowly due to the effects of the Long Depression of the 1880s. The first three kilometres opened to Castle Rock on 1 April 1881, but almost five years passed before the next section, six and a half kilometres to Murray Creek, was opened on 13 March 1886. The final six and a half kilometres were built much quicker and the line was opened all the way to Mossburn on 21 January 1887. No proposals to continue construction westwards ever had a serious chance of being realised. Stations Only three stations were on the Mossburn line (in brackets is the distance from Mararoa Junction):New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition, edited by John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 29. *Castle Rock (3.24 km) *Murray Creek (9.7 km) *Mossburn (16.29 km) The end of rails was just beyond Mossburn station, 16.9 km from the junction. Operation Traffic on the line was never heavy until the 1960s; for many years, two mixed trains ran a week from Lumsden. These trains carried both passengers and goods, with the usual inbound cargo consisting of agricultural lime and fertiliser, and wool and livestock outbound. Passengers were no longer carried after 4 October 1937, and the low freight figures implied that the line was set for a slow descent into oblivion. The Mossburn Branch did not have a predictable demise, however. Mossburn was the nearest railhead to the Manapouri hydro-electric project and the branch suddenly became very busy with traffic not only for Manapouri but also for other government schemes in the area that centred on the development of farming. Mossburn station and yard were wholly re-organised; a modern station building replaced the previous shelter shed and a station master was appointed. A train ran from Invercargill every weekday, with allowances made for a second when required. As well as relevant freight for the Manapouri project, the line also carried significant quantities of livestock, fertiliser, and serpentine for local fertiliser manufacturing plants. It was not until around 1980 that the various government projects wound down and required the railway less. The line reverted to a twice-weekly level of service, with trains running from Invercargill on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Traffic from this point became economically unsustainable and the branch closed on 13 December 1982, the same day as the section of the Kingston Branch from Makarewa to Lumsden. The branch today Very little remains of the Mossburn Branch. Most of the formation is still visible, but due to the flat nature of the land, it is insubstantial, lacking cuttings or embankments. A new road bridge across the Oreti River has been built and all traces of the railway bridge have been obliterated except for a few rails pointing to nowhere on the Lumsden bank. In Mossburn, a hotel has \\"Railway Hotel\\" moulded into its concrete fa√ßade. Nearby, the site of Mossburn's yard has been mostly bulldozed flat and only the loading bank and a few rails and sleepers remain.

The area extends from east of the Mangere Bridge when the tide is fully out, for 1 kilometre to the end of the harbour in the heart of Mangere. The waterway system is fed by a number of small open and piped creeks which bring runoff from residential, industrial and park areas in Otahuhu, Mangere East, and Favona. The largest of these fresh water runoffs is the Mangere East catchment which emerges from behind the Pacific Steel reclamation. The creek is bound by mangroves in its upper reaches. These mangroves emerged from approximately 1970s onwards, following the end of significant emissions from several large slaughterhouses. The mangrove roots create a tight course for the creek, which has deepened over time.

Notes According to one film reviewer, Radley Metzger's films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn (1969‚Äì1984), are noted for their \\"lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle\\". Another reviewer noted that his films were \\"highly artistic ‚Äî and often cerebral ... and often featured gorgeous cinematography\\". Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.

The film is based on a screenplay by Sheridan Gibney, adapted from \\"What Nancy Wanted\\" by Norma Barzman, wife of later-blacklisted writer Ben Barzman. It is noted for its complex and confusing use of layered flashbacks within flashbacks) to give psychological depth to the narrative. Summary A story told in a number of flashbacks from different points of view, this psychological drama tells the story of a bride-to-be (Day) who, as a child, was falsely accused of theft. She grows up to become a kleptomaniac, inveterate liar, and eventually a murderess. As an adult, she has several relationships with weak-minded men who allow her to ruin their lives. Apparently, all her misdeeds are an attempt to get revenge on the world by ruining people's lives after she was falsely accused of stealing as a child. After splitting up with an artist (Mitchum), ending with him committing suicide, and her psychiatrist husband (Aherne), causing him to enter a mental institution as a patient, she becomes engaged to the son (Raymond) of the woman who had accused her of thievery. Back in the present day, at her wedding, the young woman collapses physically and mentally as she walks to the altar and she is committed to a mental institution.

Reception =Critical response= When the film was released the staff at Variety magazine praised the film, writing, \\"Story carries the flashback technique to greater lengths than generally employed. The writing by Sheridan Gibney displays an understanding of the subject matter and proves a solid basis for the able performances achieved by John Brahm‚Äôs direction. Latter gears his scenes for full interest and carefully carries forward the doubt ‚Äì and audience hope ‚Äì that Nancy is not the villainess.\\" Film historians Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward praise the unusual melodrama in the RKO visual style. \\"It is distinctive in its flashbacks within flashbacks, with the story often being told by a third or fourth person removed. This device is handled effectively in preparation for the climactic flashback, which reveals the truth.\\"Silver and Ward, Film Noir An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style, The Locket, page 173. The Overlook Press, 1992. . Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"A psychological drama about a woman with a dark secret from her childhood that is carried over to her adult life. It's a post-war baroque melodrama, creaky as wooden steps in a mildewed house ... It was too wooden a presentation to generate anything but a few sparks ... It's a somber story, with a lot of heavy-handed things going on. The complexities of the heroine's character were well presented. The analyst's comments about her stealing to get even with Mrs. Willis seemed to be a reasonable explanation, if taken at face value ... The Locket only had some glitter but not enough substance.

The effective literacy of 7+ population was 83.2%. =Languages= Hindi is the official language of the town and also the language of the majority of the people. It is followed by Urdu, Odia, Bengali, Ho, Santhali, Bhojpuri and Mundari, which are also additional official languages.  Residential sections  The Chakradharpur subdivision can be divided into three residential sections. =Village panchayat= There are many villages under the Chakradharpur City, including Joro, Deogaon, danti Toklo, Dukri, Duriyam, Bharniya, Patadih, Janta, Nalita, Heselkuti, Kaida, Kudahatu, Kimirda, Gunja, Sarjamhatu, Roladih, Bagmara, Unchibita, Ramda, Tikarchampi, Jharjhara, hoyohatu, Bindasarjom, Jaipur, Banalata, Jodo, Boddar, Dalki, Ponasi, Godamdipa, Pulkani, Jamtuti, Simidiri, Hathiya, Setahaka, Etor, Kolchokra, Kera, Kansara, Dantibegna, Laudiya, Padampur, Jamid, Silphori, Chainpur, Chelabera, Chirubera, Jantalbera, Gopinathpur, Kendo, Chandri, Simidiri, Baipai, Itihasa, Asantalia, Chandri, Borda, and Ulidhi. There are many more villages under the Chakradharpur subdivision. =Nagar Parishad area= The Nagar Parishad area is divided into 23 wards. Starting with the Purani Basti, the oldest area of Chakradharpur city, the King's Castle is present here. The kings of the Singh Dynasty resided here during the British era. This area witnessed the wars with the Britishers. The city's oldest Durga Puja, said to be started by the king himself, is celebrated here, the Adi Durga Puja Samity, established in 1912. =Railway Colony= The Railway Colony comprises three wards. It covers the major part of Chakradharpur, located on the north-eastern side of the NH-75E. The colony was established during the British era, and is a well planned city. All the railway establishments are present here. There are about 8,000 staff quarters. The colony is further divided into different colonies such as the East Colony, R.E. Colony, Driver's Colony, Doubling Colony, Loco Colony, Accounts Colony, and Etwari Bazar. Transport =Roadway= This city is well connected by both road and rail. Ranchi, Chaibasa, Tatanagar and Rourkela and all neighbouring towns and villages are connected with roads. =Railway= Chakradharpur is one of the four divisional headquarters of the South Eastern Railway. The first rail line on Chakradharpur Division was opened on 22 January 1890 with the laying of the long Purulia-Chakradharpur rail line. The rail network on the main trunk route passing through Chakradharpur division was completed on 18 February 1891 when the Goilkera- Jharsuguda section was opened. With the opening of this section the main line route of Bengal Nagpur Railway (BNR) was completed. The official opening ceremony of the main line from Asansol to Nagpur, presided over by the Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne, was held at Chakradharpur station on 3 March 1891. It is located on the Tatanagar‚ÄìBilaspur section of the Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line. Chakradharpur division serves the mineral and industrially rich areas of Jharkhand and Odisha. It is spread over East and West Singhbhum, Saraikela- Kharsawan, Simdega of Jharkhand and Jharsuguda, Keonjhar, Sundargarh and Mayurbhanj districts of Odisha. In this division lies the main corridor of freight and passenger traffic between eastern and western parts of the country. This region is aptly called the Heart of the South Eastern Railway. The development of the rail network in the area presently forming Chakradharpur division dates back to the original of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, the precursor of the South Eastern Railway. The first rail line in the area serving Chakradharpur division was laid in 1890. Presently Chakradharpur division extends over a length of 741.705 route-km, of which 335.798 route-km are located over the state of Jharkhand and 405.907 km. The main line portion of the division extends over the Salgajhari-Jharsuguda portion covering a distance of 270.38 km. In addition to the main line the division has a large number of branch lines covering Tatanagar-Badampahar, Gamharia-Kandra-Chandil, Sini-Kandra, Rajkharswan-Banspani, Padapahar-Bolani- Barbil, Bondamunda-Bimlagarh, Barsuan-Kiriburu and Rourkela-Birmitrapur sections. The importance of the route covered by the division stems from the fact that it serves six major steel plants located in the region: Rourkela Steel Plant; Bhilai Steel Plant; Durgapur Steel Plant; Bokaro Steel Plant; Tata Steel, Jamshedpur and IISCO, Burnpur. It also serves the cement belt of Bilaspur division and the heavy traffic in general merchandise on the Howrah- Mumbai trunk route. The division covers some of the most difficult and picturesque terrains of the South Eastern Railway, passing through the verdant forest of Saranda including the two Saranda tunnels on the main line between Mahadevsal and Posoita stations. The division loads bulk requirement of iron and manganese ores, dolomite, limestone and other raw materials for all major steel plants of the country. Two steel plants, Rourkela steel plant and TISCO at Jamshedpur, are located within the division. It serves the Sponge Iron Plant at Manikui and other ancillary industries spread around the two plants, as well as the cement factories located at Jhinkpani, Rajgangpur, Tatanagar, Dhutra and mini cement plants and sponge-iron manufacturing industries around Rourkela. The main commodities loaded on the division comprise raw material for steel plants, cement and other general merchandise. The Chakradharpur division has 86 stations. Chakradharpur railway station is one of the important stations since its foundation. Mahatma Gandhi visited here to inspect the facilities during the British Rule, which he mentioned in his book Third class in Indian Railways. From the history Justice Harihar Mahapatra mentioned his visit to Chakradharpur around 1916, in his book My Life, My Work. The rich mineral deposits around the Sanjay-Binjay valley was mentioned in the book Prehistoric India by Panchanan Mitra. The book also tells about the cave paintings and natural belongings of the adjoining region, including facts from Mr. Anderson's collections and their visit during the early 20th century. The rich presence of the Anglo Indian Community in Chakradharpur Railway Colony was mentioned in the book Pagan Love: Anglo Indian Story by Mervyn Rupert Welsh. The book also tells about the Burton Lake, which is now a hangout zone. The Geological Survey of India says there is a rich deposit of a composite batholith of a banded trondhjemitic material intruded by tonalite, granodiorite, granite and alkali-feldspar granite which was metamorphosed and deformed by a F3 event, which they named \\"Chakradharpur Granite Gneiss\\". Mahatma Gandhi mentioned his visit to Chakradharpur Railway Station in his book Third Class in Indian Railways.

It travels through Dallas before rejoining with I-35W to reform I-35 in Denton. This is one of two pairs of suffixed Interstates that has not been eliminated; I-35 also splits into I-35E and I-35W in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul, Minnesota. Historically, other interstates were given directional suffixes. On every other interstate, the directional suffixes were phased out by giving the route a loop or spur designation (such as I-270 in Maryland, which was once I-70S), or in some cases were assigned a different route number (such as I-76, which was once I-80S). In the case of I-35, since both branches return to a unified interstate beyond the twin cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, the AASHTO committees allowed the suffixes to remain.

This highway travels parallel to I-35E after splitting off of I-35 north of Hillsboro, running through Italy and Milford. It joins with I-35E for less than just south of Waxahachie, before splitting back off to run through Waxahachie. It rejoins the interstate just north of a junction with State Highway 342 in Red Oak. US 77 stays with the interstate through Dallas and up to the southeastern section of Denton. It then breaks off, rejoining I-35 north of the city.

Reconstruction of I-35E and the downtown Mixmaster interchange with I-30 is planned as part of the Horseshoe project, derived from the larger Pegasus Project. From this point, I-35E is named the Stemmons Freeway to Lewisville. This section will undergo reconstruction in three phases. The first, a widening of I-35E from I-635 to Denton, will start in late 2011 to over 16 lanes. The second, the LBJ Project, will include elevated toll I-35E lanes by 2016.

This means roughly that it is a \\"nonperiodic oscillator\\"; it produces an oscillating waveform that, unlike an ordinary electronic oscillator, never \\"repeats\\". It was invented in 1983 by Leon O. Chua, who was a visitor at Waseda University in Japan at that time. The ease of construction of the circuit has made it a ubiquitous real-world example of a chaotic system, leading some to declare it \\"a paradigm for chaos\\". Chaotic criteria One version of Chua's circuit, where the nonlinear Chua's diode is synthesized by an op amp negative impedance converter (OPA1) and a diode‚Äìresistor network (D1, D2, R2) An autonomous circuit made from standard components (resistors, capacitors, inductors) must satisfy three criteria before it can display chaotic behaviour. It must contain: # one or more nonlinear elements, # one or more locally active resistors, # three or more energy-storage elements. Chua's circuit is the simplest electronic circuit meeting these criteria. As shown in the top figure, the energy storage elements are two capacitors (labeled C1 and C2) and an inductor (labeled L; L1 in lower figure). A \\"locally active resistor\\" is a device that has negative resistance and is active (it can amplify), providing the power to generate the oscillating current. The locally active resistor and nonlinearity are combined in the device NR, which is called \\"Chua's diode\\". This device is not sold commercially but is implemented in various ways by active circuits. The circuit diagram shows one common implementation. The nonlinear resistor is implemented by two linear resistors and two diodes. At the far right is a negative impedance converter made from three linear resistors and an operational amplifier, which implements the locally active resistance (negative resistance). Models Computer simulation of Chua's circuit after 100 seconds, showing chaotic \\"double scroll\\" attractor pattern Chua's attractor for different values of the Œ± parameter Analyzing the circuit using Kirchhoff's circuit laws, the dynamics of Chua's circuit can be accurately modeled by means of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations in the variables x(t), y(t), and z(t), which represent the voltages across the capacitors C1 and C2 and the electric current in the inductor L1 respectively. These equations are: :\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\\\alpha [y - x - f(x)], :RC_2 \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = x - y + Rz, :\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\\\beta y. The function f(x) describes the electrical response of the nonlinear resistor, and its shape depends on the particular configuration of its components. The parameters Œ± and Œ≤ are determined by the particular values of the circuit components. A computer-assisted proof of chaotic behavior (more precisely, of positive topological entropy) in Chua's circuit was published in 1997.Z. Galias, \\"Positive topological entropy of Chua's circuit: a computer-assisted proof\\", Int. J. Bifurcations and Chaos, 7 (1997), pp. 331‚Äì349. A self-excited chaotic attractor, known as \\"the double scroll\\" because of its shape in the (x, y, z) space, was first observed in a circuit containing a nonlinear element such that f(x) was a 3-segment piecewise-linear function. The easy experimental implementation of the circuit, combined with the existence of a simple and accurate theoretical model, makes Chua's circuit a useful system to study many fundamental and applied issues of chaos theory. Because of this, it has been object of much study and appears widely referenced in the literature. Further, Chua' s circuit can be easily realized by using a multilayer CNN (cellular nonlinear network). CNNs were invented by Leon Chua in 1988. The Chua diode can also be replaced by a memristor; an experimental setup that implemented Chua's chaotic circuit with a memristor was demonstrated by Muthuswamy in 2009; the memristor was actually implemented with active components in this experiment.Bharathwaj Muthuswamy, \\"Implementing memristor based chaotic circuits\\", International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, Vol. 20, No. 5 (2010) 1335‚Äì1350, World Scientific Publishing Company, . =Self- excited and hidden Chua attractors= Two hidden chaotic attractors and one hidden periodic attractor coexist with two trivial attractors in Chua circuit (from the IJBC cover). The classical implementation of Chua circuit is switched on at the zero initial data, thus a conjecture was that the chaotic behavior is possible only in the case of unstable zero equilibrium. In this case a chaotic attractor in mathematical model can be obtained numerically, with relative ease, by standard computational procedure where after transient process a trajectory, started from a point of unstable manifold in a small neighborhood of unstable zero equilibrium, reaches and computes a self-excited attractor. To date, a large number of various types of self-excited chaotic attractors in Chua's system have been discovered. However, in 2009, N. Kuznetsov discovered hidden Chua's attractors coexisting with stable zero equilibrium, and since then various scenarios of the birth of hidden attractors have been described.

Phillips rose to become the CIA's chief of operations for the Western hemisphere. In 1975 he founded the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO), an alumni association comprising intelligence officers from all services. Phillips was repeatedly accused of involvement in the JFK assassination, named by both investigators and Agency family members. Implications of his guilt stemming from both the mid-1970s House Select Committee on Assassination and a pair of assassination exposes originally proved inconclusive, but since a 2014 reversal of crucial exonerating House Committee testimony point at his complicity. Early life and military career Phillips was born in Fort Worth, Texas and attended The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia and Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. Phillips was an actor prior to World War II. During the war, he served as a nose gunner in the United States Army Air Forces. He was shot down over Austria and captured by the Germans, but was able to escape and make it back to Allied lines. CIA career Phillips joined the CIA as a part-time agent in 1950 in Chile, where he owned and edited \\"The South Pacific Mail\\", an English-language newspaper that circulated throughout South America and several islands in the Pacific. He became a full-time operative in 1954, and operated a major psychological warfare campaign in Guatemala during the US coup and its aftermath.Max Holland, \\"Operation PBHISTORY: The Aftermath of SUCCESS\\", International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence 17(2), 2004, p. 305. \\"At one time an aspiring actor, David Atlee Phillips was fluent in Spanish and fresh from working under contract to the CIA during PBSuccess.

Conspiracy allegations and lawsuit In their 1980 book Death in Washington, authors Donald Freed and Fred Landis charged that the CIA was involved in the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat and the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier. The authors specifically named Phillips as being involved in a cover-up of the assassination and reiterated Fonzi's claim that Phillips served as Oswald's case officer while using the alias \\"Maurice Bishop\\". In 1982, Freed, Landis, and their publisher were named in a $230 million libel suit by Phillips and the AFIO. A settlement was reached in 1976 (?) with Phillips receiving a retraction and an unspecified amount of money. Phillips donated these proceeds to AFIO for the purpose of creating a legal defense fund for American intelligence officers who felt they were the victims of libel. After the death of former CIA agent and Watergate figure E.

The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, \\"American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond\\", to avoid possible perjury charges. Hunt's widow and other children told the Los Angeles Times that the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain. The newspaper said it examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \\"inconclusive.\\" Alpha 66 founder Antonio Veciana's 2014 recantation of his House Committee testimony denying he knew Philips with an unequivocal statement that he believed that the agent he knew as Bishop had in fact been David Atlee Phillips reopens Phillips' possible central role in the JFK assassination. Later life Phillips wrote and lectured frequently on intelligence matters. He authored five books, including his CIA memoir The Night Watch, Careers in Secret Operations: How to Be a Federal Intelligence Officer, The Terror Brigade, The Carlos Contract, and The Great Texas Murder Trials: A Compelling Account of the Sensational T. Cullen Davis Case. Personal life In 1948, Phillips married Helen Hausman Haasch. They had four children, then divorced in 1967. In 1969 he married Virginia Pederson Simmons, who had three children from a previous marriage. Together, the couple had one other child. Phillips died at his home in Bethesda, Maryland from complications of cancer on July 7, 1988; at the age of 65. Publications =Books= *The Night Watch: 25 Years of Peculiar Service.

The film was probably the earliest French example of a filmed musical-comedy, although its often dark tone differentiates it from other instances of the genre. It was the first French production of the sound film era to achieve great international success. Plot In a working-class district of Paris, Albert, an impecunious street singer, lives in an attic room. He meets a beautiful Romanian girl, Pola, and falls in love with her; but he is not the only one, since his best friend Louis and the gangster Fred are also under her spell. One evening Pola dares not return home because Fred has stolen her key and she does not feel safe. She spends the night with Albert who, reluctantly remaining the gentleman, sleeps on the floor and leaves his bed to Pola. They soon decide to get married, but fate prevents them when √âmile, a thief, deposits with Albert a bag full of stolen goods. It is discovered by the police, and Albert is sent to prison. Pola finds consolation with Louis. Later √âmile is caught in his turn and admits that Albert was not his accomplice, which earns Albert his freedom. Fred has just got back together with Pola who has fallen out with Louis, and in a jealous fury at Albert's return Fred decides to provoke a knife fight with him. Louis rushes to Albert's rescue and the two comrades are re-united, but their friendship is clouded by the realisation that each of them is in love with Pola. Finally Albert decides to give up Pola to Louis. Cast *Albert Pr√©jean as Albert *Pola Ill√©ry as Pola *Edmond T.

In 1927, even before The Jazz Singer had been shown in Paris, Ren√© Clair wrote: \\"It is not without a shudder that one learns that some American manufacturers, among the most dangerous, see in the talking picture the entertainment of the future, and that they are already working to bring about this dreadful prophecy\\".\\"On n'apprendra pas sans fr√©mir que certains industriels am√©ricains, parmi les plus dangereux, voient dans le cin√©ma parlant le spectacle de l'avenir et qu'ils travaillent d√®s maintenant √† r√©aliser cette effrayante proph√©tie\\": quoted in Jean-Pierre Jeancolas, 15 ans des ann√©es trente. Paris: Stock, 1983. p.55. Elsewhere he described the talking picture as \\"a redoubtable monster, an unnatural creation, thanks to which the screen would become poor theatre, the theatre of the poor\\".Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. Paris: Plon, 1998. p.154: \\"...cin√©ma parlant, monstre redoutable, cr√©ation contre nature, gr√¢ce √† laquelle l'√©cran deviendrait un pauvre th√©√¢tre, le th√©√¢tre du pauvre.\\" It was therefore an irony that it was Clair who would produce the French cinema's first big international success with a sound picture in Sous les toits de Paris. Clair accepted the inevitability of the talking picture but at first retained very specific views about the way that sound should be integrated into film. He was reluctant to use dialogue or sound effects naturalistically, and maintained that the alternate use of the image of the subject and of the sound produced by it - not their simultaneous use - created the best effect.Roy Armes, French Cinema. London: Secker & Warburg, 1985. p.74. In 1929, the German film company Tobis Klangfilm (Tobis Sound-Film) established a studio at √âpinay near Paris which was equipped for sound production. This studio inaugurated a policy of making French-speaking films in France rather than importing French performers to make French versions of films in Germany. The company concentrated on prestigious productions, and they recruited Ren√© Clair to undertake one of their first French projects with Sous les toits de Paris.Alastair Phillips, \\"Migration and Exile in the Classical Period\\", in The French Cinema Book. London: British Film Institute, 2004. p.104. Other early French sound films were Prix de beaut√© (Miss Europe) and L'√Çge d'or. Production Ren√© Clair filmed Sous les toits de Paris at √âpinay between 2 January and 21 March 1930.Jean-Pierre Jeancolas, 15 ans des ann√©es trente. Paris: Stock, 1983. p.72. Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. Paris: Plon, 1998. The setting of the film was defined by the elaborately realistic yet evocative set which Lazare Meerson devised to depict a street of Parisian tenements, populated by familiar archetypes of 'ordinary life': the young newly-weds, the pickpocket, the street singer. The film begins with a long crane shot (engineered by cameraman Georges P√©rinal) which starts among the rooftops and then descends along the street closing in on a group of people gathered around a singer, whose song (the title-song) gradually swells up on the soundtrack. (A reversal of this shot ends the film.) This is the first of many ways in which Clair affirms his loyalty to the style and techniques of silent cinema while creating a distinctive role for the new element of sound. Elsewhere, a conversation is cut off by the closing of a glass door and then has to be followed in dumb-show; the hour of midnight is indicated by the sound of a mere three chimes - and the superimposition of a clockface; and a knife-fight is first seen but not heard as a passing train drowns out all else, and then the fight's continuation in darkness is conveyed only by its sounds until the headlights of a car illuminate the scene. Such devices are not only imaginative but amount almost to a satire of the sound film.Georges Sadoul, Le Cin√©ma fran√ßais, 1890-1962. Paris: Flammarion, 1962. p.55. Among the other members of Clair's team on the film were Georges Lacombe as assistant director and Marcel Carn√© handling script continuity (\\"secr√©taire de plateau\\").Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. Paris: Plon, 1998. p.158. During the last weeks of filming, the art director Lazare Meerson hired a 23-year-old Hungarian as a replacement in his team, Alexandre Trauner, who went on to work as designer on many major French films of the following decades. Sous les toits de Paris was the first of four successful sound films that Clair made for Tobis, all in collaboration with Meerson and P√©rinal. It was also the sixth and last of Clair's films which featured the actor Albert Pr√©jean. When it was shown in Paris, the cinema gave Pr√©jean star billing in its advertisements which led the two men to fall out. Clair commented: \\"I think that the star system is immoral and unjust for everyone, the artists and technicians, who work on a shared project\\".Patrick Pr√©jean, Albert Pr√©jean. Paris: √âditions Candeau, 1979. Quoted in Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. Paris: Plon, 1998. p.165: \\"Je trouve que le syst√®me de la vedette est immoral et injuste pour tous ceux, artistes et techniciens, qui travaillent √† une ≈ìuvre commune\\". The future film director Edmond T. Gr√©ville appeared as an actor in the role of Albert's friend Louis.Dictionnaire du cin√©ma fran√ßais; sous la direction de Jean-Loup Passek. Paris: Larousse, 1987. p. 182. When the film first came out, it began with a five-minute sequence outlining the relationships of the main characters, before the spectacular travelling shot that descends from the rooftops. In later versions this introduction disappeared, perhaps reflecting Clair's second thoughts, and the symmetry of the film's beginning and end was allowed to stand out.Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. Paris: Plon, 1998. p.166-167. Reception The film was first presented at the Moulin Rouge cinema in Paris from 2 May 1930, advertised as \\"100% talking and singing in French\\",\\"Cent pour cent parlant et chantant fran√ßais\\": Jean-Pierre Jeancolas, 15 ans des ann√©es trente. Paris: Stock, 1983. p.73. but it did not at first have more than a modest success in its own country. In fact only about one quarter of the film could be described as 'talking', and this may have contributed to the disappointment with which it was greeted by many Parisians, eager to experience the new medium.Dictionnaire du cin√©ma populaire fran√ßais; ed. Christian-Marc Boss√©no & Yannick Deh√©e. Paris: Nouveau Monde, 2004. p.720 Among the other criticisms which were made by French reviewers were the slowness of the narrative, the conventionality of the characters, and the systematic emphasis on the Paris of hoodlums and the underworld.E.g. √âmile Vuillermoz, in Le Temps, 24 mai 1930: \\"Le lenteur du r√©cit, le caract√®re arbitraire et conventionnel de la psychologie des personnages, l'usage constant du lieu commun et du poncif rendent plus insupportable encore ce parti pris de pr√©senter √©ternellement Paris comme le paradis des pierreuses et des apaches.\\" [\\"The slowness of the narrative, the arbitrary and conventional style of the characters' psychology, the constant use of platitude and clich√© make even more unbearable this determination to show Paris always as the paradise of streetwalkers and gangsters.\\"] The director of the French branch of Tobis, Dr Henckel, had given Clair complete freedom to make the film, but after the Paris opening he told Clair that it was now clear what others thought of his methods, and that in future he would have to resign himself to giving the audience what they wanted - talking pictures that really talked.Georges Charensol & Roger R√©gent, 50 ans de cin√©ma, avec Ren√© Clair. Paris: √âditions de la Table Ronde, 1979. p.77: \\"Vous avez fait ce que vous avez voulez, et vous voyez ce que l'on en pense. Pour notre prochaine production il faudra vous r√©signer √† offrir aux gens ce qu'ils veulent - du parlant vraiment parlant\\". However a gala screening of the film, attended by Clair, was arranged in Berlin in August 1930, and there it was greeted as a triumph. Its run in German cinemas continued for several months. This success was repeated when the film appeared in New York and in London (both in December 1930), and it was also well received in Tokyo, Shanghai, Moscow and Buenos Aires.Georges Sadoul, Dictionnaire des films. Paris: Seuil, 1983. p.294. After its international acclaim, Sous les toits de Paris was released again in France and this time it enjoyed a real success on its home ground. Early defenders of the film's warmth and charm, such as Jacques Brunius and Henri-Georges Clouzot,Jacques-Bernard Brunius, in La Revue du cin√©ma, 1 juin 1930: \\"Voici le premier film humain de Ren√© Clair. Je ne sais pas dire pourquoi humain. Il suffit d'aller le voir en toute bonne foi pour √™tre touch√© par des accents populaires tr√®s simples et que pourtant on n'avait jamais restitue√©s √† des spectateurs de cin√©ma.\\" [\\"Here is the first human film of Ren√© Clair. I can't say why human. You only have to go to see it in good faith to be touched by its popular tone, very simple, yet something which has never been presented to filmgoers.\\"]. Henri-Georges Clouzot, in L'Opinion, 11 octobre 1930: \\"Rarement l'auteur du Chapeau de paille d'Italie et des Deux timides a √©t√© mieux inspir√© que dans ce film l√©ger, primesautier, profond sans en avoir l'air. Nulle part il n'a sacrifi√© l'image, ni l'√©motion qui s'en d√©gage.\\" [\\"Rarely has the author of Un chapeau de paille d'Italie and Les Deux timides been better inspired than in this film that is light, spontaneous, profound without seeming to be. Nowhere has he sacrificed the image, nor the emotion which emerges from it.\\"] found greater support, and the originality of the approach to sound was better appreciated. Ren√© Clair later recalled that the profits were such that the cost of the film, which was considerable, was covered by the returns from a single cinema.C.G. Crisp, The Classic French Cinema, 1930-1960. Bloomington: Indiana U.P., 1993. p102. During the following decade, the film's creation of a colourful working-class neighbourhood as the setting and source of a contemporary drama found an echo in such films as La Rue sans nom (1934), La Belle √âquipe (1936) and Le Crime de Monsieur Lange (1936).Raymond Chirat, \\"Et la parole fut...\\", in L'Avant- Sc√®ne Cin√©ma, n.281, f√©v. 1982. p.6. Modern judgments of the film, while acknowledging its importance for its time, have tended to find it limited by its nostalgic portrayal of the \\"little people\\" of Paris and by its \\"studio artifice\\"; in the words of one critic, it tends to \\"smother cinematic interest with the sheer cleverness of the conception and the technical mastery of the execution\\".David Thomson, A New Biographical Dictionary of Film\\"; 4th ed. London: Little, Brown, 2002. p.160. There are hesitations in its continuity and pacing, and uncertainty in some of the performances as they try to adapt to the spoken word.Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. Paris: Plon, 1998. p.165. On the other hand, questions which Clair was addressing about the appropriate use of sound in an essentially visual medium continue to be valid, and his film remains a witty exploration of some of the possible answers.Jean- Pierre Jeancolas, 15 ans des ann√©es trente. Paris: Stock, 1983. p.72.: Clair \\"s'√©tait interrog√© sur ce qu'on pouvait faire avec du son, en le traitant comme un mat√©riau aussi mall√©able que la lumi√®re ou le com√©dien. Sous les toits de Paris est le premier fruit de ses r√©flexions\\". [\\"Clair had asked himself what could be done with sound, by treating it as a material as malleable as the light or the actor. Sous les toits de Paris is the first fruit of his reflections.\\"] References External links * *Under the Roofs of Paris an essay by Luc Sante at the Criterion Collection Category:1930 films Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:Romanian- language films Category:French musical comedy-drama films Category:French black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Ren√© Clair Category:1930s musical comedy-drama films Category:Films set in Paris Category:1930 comedy films Category:1930 drama films ","title":"Under the Roofs of Paris"},{"id":"3645285","text":"NCR 53c80 SCSI controllerThe NCR 5380 is an early SCSI controller chip developed by NCR Microelectronics.

O 20 along with her sister ship were the first boats in the world to be equipped with a submarine snorkel that allowed the submarine to run its diesel engines while submerged. Ship history O 20 was laid down 15 June 1936 as K XX. After which at some point she was renamed O 20. She was launched on 31 January 1939, and on 28 August of the same year she was commissioned in the Dutch navy. She was put into a squadron that consisted of two submarines: O 20 and , and the sloop . This squadron departed the Netherlands for the Netherlands West Indies on either 2 or 3 October 1939. By December 1939 O 20 reached the Dutch East Indies via the Panama Canal. =World War II= On 10 May 1940 Germany attacked the Netherlands. On 7 December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the US into the war. The Netherlands followed suit hours later. By early December 1941, O 20 had been stationed at Singapore Submarine Base and was under the command of the British Eastern Fleet. On 14 December 1941 O 20 was under orders to patrol the South China Sea. When two battleships and six cruisers were sighted, O 20 and O 19 were given orders to gain position on the enemy ships. The two subs would split paths en route to the target when 13 transports were spotted off Patani, Thailand and another 20 off Kota Bharu, Malaysia. Given a new patrol route, O 20 spotted Japanese destroyers off and on from 17 to 19 December. On 19 December at 7:00, she spied two Japanese transports being escorted by two destroyers. In a few hours a third destroyer joined them. These destroyers were , , and . At 11:00, O 20 was spotted by enemy planes which dropped two bombs on the submarine and alerted the destroyers to her presence. The submarine dove and was able to avoid the bombs, but the destroyers began to drop depth charges which soon destroyed the submarine's listening device and caused other minor damage. The destroyers scanned the bay for O 20, dropping eight depth charges every half-hour. Some of these detonated directly above the submarine, but were set to detonate too shallow to badly damage it. (It turned out that the next deepest setting would have buried the charges in the mud) In order to escape, the commander ordered full speed ahead with all planes set to rise, but O 20 had become mired in the mud. An air tank was blown in an attempt to loose the submarine from the seabed, but also ended up alerting the destroyers to O 20s position by releasing bubbles. That night, the commander attempted to surface to escape at full speed, but was detected by a new Japanese sonar. Two more tanks were blown and the sub surfaced at a 25¬∞ angle and engines were set to full speed. Because of some pre-existing defects O 20 began to take on water at the screw shafts. The hatch was opened and with no enemy ships in sight, the machine guns were not manned or prepared. The commander decided to empty a fuel tank in order to escape even faster, which rose the sub even higher in the water exposing the diesel exhaust pipes. Due to more pre-existing damage coupled with damage from the depth charges, the pipes began to spark, giving away O 20s position to anyone who looked in her direction. The commander decided to do nothing. After 20 minutes of running in this manner, one of the destroyers closed in, spotted O 20 with her searchlight and opened fire. The shot missed. The commander now ordered the machine guns manned, and the ship turned about to fire the torpedoes. She couldn't get in position until after the fourth volley, which struck the conning tower and main hull. O 20 returned fire with her 40 mm machine gun. The port side torpedo was ordered to be fired, but because of extreme vibrations due to the speed, both sides fired. Both torpedoes missed. The sub badly damaged, the commander decided then that there was no hope for escape, and ordered all hands on deck. He then ordered the sub be scuttled by flooding all the main ballast tanks. The sub descended under the water, still running at full speed, as the crew floated above. The destroyer, apparently not noticing that the crew had abandoned ship, followed the sub, cutting through the crew at , and dropped depth charges on the now abandoned sub. After daylight, Uranami rescued the 32 survivors, having dropped depth charges throughout the remainder of the night to keep sharks away. Seven men, including the commander were found to be missing. The commander was known to not have been wearing his life vest, which may have also been the cause of the other six deaths. An alternative suggestion is that since the six men all worked in the engine room, they may have not been warned in time to evacuate the ship before it was scuttled. =The shipwreck= On 12 June 2002 a group of 7 Dutch divers associated participated in a dive expedition to locate O 20. The wreck is located approximately North-East of Kota Baru, Malaysia at a depth of about . The divers report that the masts are no longer visible, the snort is gone, and that the bridge was shelled so badly it could be seen through easily. The divers retrieved a deck phone from the sub in order to positively identify it, but left the wreck alone, as it was likely the gravesite of six seamen and their commander.

He played in eight Test matches for England from 1923 to 1933, achieving the rare feat of taking a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket. One of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1924, he took 1,838 first-class wickets at an average of 17.64 including four hat- tricks. A leading member of the Yorkshire team which achieved a high level of success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War. Early life Macaulay was born in Thirsk on 7 December 1897. His father was a well-known local cricketer, as were his uncles. Macaulay was educated at Barnard Castle; in later years, he took teams of famous cricketers to play annual matches against the school eleven. Upon leaving school, he worked as a bank clerk in Wakefield; there, and in nearby Ossett, he played cricket and football.Woodhouse, p. 306. In the First World War, Macaulay served with the Royal Field Artillery; afterwards he returned to work for the same bank as before, initially in London, then in Herne Bay, Kent, playing club cricket in his spare time. Playing career =Yorkshire debut= In 1920, Yorkshire needed to strengthen its bowling attack. Of the team's previously successful bowlers, Major Booth had been killed in the war, Alonzo Drake had died soon afterwards from illness, and George Hirst was past his best. Although Wilfred Rhodes was able to ease the shortfall by resuming his career as a frontline spin bowler, Yorkshire needed new bowlers, particularly pacemen. Macaulay had been spotted playing club cricket by Sir Stanley Christopherson, a former Kent player. Subsequently, Harry Hayley, a 19th-century Yorkshire cricketer, saw Macaulay in action and was sufficiently impressed to recommend him for a trial with the county. At the beginning of the 1920 season, Macaulay played in two warm-up games for Yorkshire, taking six wickets for 52 runs in a one-day game and four for 24 and two for 19 in a two-day game. This was good enough to earn a first-class debut on 15 May 1920 against Derbyshire in the County Championship, although he only took one wicket. Playing in the early part of the season, he took five wickets for 50 runs, his first five wicket haul, against Gloucestershire, followed by six for 47 against Worcestershire. He continued to play until the middle of June before dropping out of the team after an unsuccessful match against Surrey.Woodhouse, p. 305. In ten first- class matches, he had taken 24 wickets at an average of 24.35, and managed a top score of just 15 with the bat. Wisden said he \\"had neither the pace nor the stamina required\\", while it later said he tried to bowl at speeds beyond his capability. Even so, he decided to become a professional cricketer. Hirst and Rhodes persuaded him to reduce his pace and concentrate on bowling a good length while trying to spin the ball. He practised through the winter of 1920‚Äì21 to be ready for the next season. Bowling a mixture of medium pace and his new style of off spin, Macaulay played 27 matches in 1921. After taking wickets steadily at the start of the season, in his fourth game he took six wickets for ten runs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 72. Four more wickets in the second innings gave Yorkshire a big victory and Macaulay had match figures of ten wickets for 65 runs, the first time he had taken ten wickets in a match. Macaulay then came to wider public attention by taking six wickets for three runs to bowl out Derbyshire for 23 runs. He later took ten wickets in the match against Surrey in a losing cause, and in total that season he took 101 first-class wickets at an average of 17.33, placing him third in the Yorkshire bowling averages. With the bat, he scored 457 runs at an average of 22.59, surprising commentators with his ability. This included a maiden first- class century against Nottinghamshire. His innings of 125 not out took Yorkshire from 211 for seven wickets when he came in to bat (228 for eight soon after) to a total of 438 for nine declared, a lead of 264; Yorkshire went on to a comfortable win. His overall success in the season meant that his place in the team was secure. Macaulay improved his bowling record in 1922, taking more wickets at a lower average (133 wickets at an average of 14.67), and scoring another century. Helping Yorkshire to win the first of four County Championships in a row, Macaulay finished second to Rhodes in the team's bowling averages. The first two matches of the season brought Macaulay figures of six for eight and five for 23 in a ten wicket win over Northamptonshire and six for 12 out of an opposition total of 78 in an innings win over Glamorgan. While he took only one wicket in the second innings, his first three innings had given him 17 wickets for 43 runs. He continued to pick up wickets, but his most significant performance came in June. In front of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) members at Lord's, he took five for 31 as Middlesex were bowled out for 138. Those watching were impressed and he was selected for the Players against the Gentlemen at the same ground in July. He took three for 97 out of a total of 430 in one of the most important matches of the season. These performances earned his selection for the MCC tour to South Africa that winter, although there were concerns his fitness was insufficient. Statistically, Macaulay's best performance came shortly afterwards against Gloucestershire; he took seven for 47 and twelve wickets in the match. Macaulay also scored 486 runs at an average of 17.35. =Test debut= Macaulay played eight first-class matches in South Africa in 1922‚Äì23, taking 29 wickets at an average of 16.37. His best first-class performances were six for 18 against Pretoria and eight wickets in the match against Transvaal, while he was effective in minor matches, taking five for 40 against East Rand and six for 19 against Zululand. After England lost the first Test match, which Wisden attributed to a weakness in bowling, Macaulay replaced Greville Stevens and made his Test match debut for England in the second Test. He took the wicket of George Hearne with his first ball. He was the fourth player to take a wicket with his maiden delivery in Test cricket. In total, he took two for 19 in the first innings. In the second innings, South Africa were comfortably placed with a score of 157 for one, but four wickets fell to Macaulay while 13 runs were scored. Macaulay ended the innings with five wickets for 64. Wisden commented that he bowled very finely in this match. He hit the winning run, batting at number eleven, to seal a one-wicket win for England. He played in the remaining three Tests, finishing with 16 wickets at an average of 20.37. England won the series 2‚Äì1, but the Wisden correspondent for the tour was not impressed by the English performances, noting that no really effective bowlers had emerged. alt=A man wearing a white shirt With his health improved by the tour, Wisden reported that Macaulay was in excellent form for the whole of the 1923 season. His performances earned him selection as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation praised his stamina, spin and ability to bowl on all kinds of pitches but noted that he was easily discouraged and had a negative attitude if circumstances went against him. He achieved his highest season total of wickets to date, taking 166 at an average of 13.84, and came third in both the Yorkshire and national bowling averages.Woodhouse, p. 327. His best performance came in the first match of the season, when he took seven wickets for 13 against Glamorgan as they were dismissed for 63. Later in the season, he took a hat-trick against Warwickshire while claiming five for 42. With the bat, Macaulay scored 463 runs at an average of 18.52. There were no international matches that season, but Macaulay was selected for The Rest in a Test trial against England in which he took just one wicket. In 1924, Macaulay further increased his total of wickets to 190 and lowered his bowling average to 13.23, placing him first in the national averages.Woodhouse, p. 333. His batting declined as he scored 395 runs at an average of 11.96. Although selected for another Test trial, Macaulay did not play in the series against the touring South African team until the third Test at Leeds, where he took one wicket in each South African innings, but was omitted from the final two Tests. Despite his success in the season, he was not chosen to tour Australia with the MCC that winter, even though Maurice Tate, the leading bowler on the tour, lacked support. Macaulay had been involved in controversy on the field in 1924. At the time, the Yorkshire team were notorious for their aggressive attitude while fielding.Hill, p. 106. In a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield, the hostility of the crowd provoked an MCC inquiry which found that Yorkshire bowler Abe Waddington had incited the spectators.Hill, pp. 106‚Äì07. Further incidents followed against Surrey.Hill, p. 107. The editor of Wisden blamed Yorkshire's poor discipline on a small group of approximately four players. Without naming Macaulay as one of them, he noted that Lord Hawke, the Yorkshire president, believed Macaulay should have been in the team to Australia, and that \\"it was entirely his own fault he was not chosen\\". It is also possible that during a match at this time, Macaulay openly criticised the captaincy and bowling of Arthur Gilligan, the England captain.Marshall, p. 106. Marshall claims that the incident took place in the 1924 Lord's Test, but Macaulay did not play in that game. Since 1923, Macaulay had run a cricket outfitters in Leeds and Wakefield with his Yorkshire team-mate Herbert Sutcliffe, borrowing ¬£250 from his mother to help establish the business. During the winter of 1924‚Äì25, the shop became a limited company and Macaulay one of its directors. According to Sutcliffe's biographer Alan Hill, Macaulay quickly lost interest, and the partnership was dissolved a year later, but Sutcliffe made the lone venture a success.Hill, pp. 77‚Äì78. Macaulay received ¬£900 from the outfitters upon his resignation. =Mid-1920s career= Macaulay's most successful season in terms of wickets was 1925, despite a very dry summer which produced a succession of good batting pitches. He took 211 wickets at an average of 15.48, coming top of the Yorkshire averages. Exactly 200 of his wickets were taken for Yorkshire‚Äîonly Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst had previously reached 200 wickets for Yorkshire, and only Bob Appleyard has done so since, as of 2013. One of Macaulay's highest profile performances in 1925 came for Yorkshire against Sussex, who were chasing 263 to win the game. Just after lunch on the final day, the score was 223 for three wickets. A possibly apocryphal story suggests that Macaulay drank champagne in the interval.Pope, p. 166. He then delivered a spell of five wickets for eight runs in 33 balls to bowl out his opponents and finish with figures of seven for 67. He then left the field exhausted. The cricket historian Mick Pope describes the match as a \\"lasting testimony to [Macaulay's] belief that no cause was ever lost\\".Pope, pp. 165‚Äì66. Macaulay was again selected for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's, and took five wickets in the match. With the bat, Macaulay scored 621 runs at an average of 23.88, although he only passed fifty twice. Yorkshire's reign as County Champions ended in 1926, the first season since 1921 when Yorkshire did not win the Championship. Wisden noted that the Yorkshire attack, with the exception of Rhodes, was less effective than previously.Rogerson, p. 142. Macaulay bowled less overs and took fewer wickets at a higher bowling average; his 134 wickets, at an average of 17.78, placed him second in the Yorkshire averages. Selected for a Test trial, he failed to take a wicket. Wisden described his performance as \\"lifeless\\", while cricket writer Neville Cardus noted that he had \\"yet again ... fallen below his best away from the Yorkshire XI\\". He was not chosen for the Gentlemen v Players match, never representing the Players again. Macaulay was selected for the third Test against Australia at Headingley, possibly because Arthur Carr, the England captain, expected the pitch to favour spinners. The Australians were concerned that Macaulay represented a threat to their batting, but the match did not work out in Macaulay's favour as a bowler; having been dropped at the start of play, Charlie Macartney played what Wisden called one of the best innings of his career and vigorously attacked the England bowling, achieving the rare feat of scoring a century before the lunch interval. The Australian batsman had asked his captain if he could attack Macaulay in particular, and the Yorkshire bowler suffered as Macartney quickly dominated him. Macaulay eventually had Macartney caught after hitting a short ball in the air, but it was Macaulay's only success in the innings. Macaulay conceded 123 runs in 32 overs as Australia scored 494. When Macaulay came into bat from number ten in the batting order, England were 182 for eight wickets and facing defeat. He played an attacking innings of 76, hitting ten fours, in a partnership of 108 with George Geary. This began an England recovery which helped the team to escape with a draw. Nevertheless, Macaulay did not play in the final two Tests of the series. Later in the season, he took fourteen wickets for 92 runs against Gloucestershire, including eight for 43 in the second innings. These were the best bowling figures of his career that he achieved in a match. Apart from his batting success in the Test match, Macaulay scored another two fifties and in the match against Somerset achieved a century. =Decline= Over the next four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, although they never finished lower than fourth in the table.Woodhouse, pp. 344, 350, 358, 366‚Äì67. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly after the death of Roy Kilner in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak.Woodhouse, pp. 358, 367. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930. In 1927, Macaulay took 130 wickets at an average of 18.26. However, he suffered a foot injury in 1928, and took time to recover his best form.Hodgson, p. 122. His wicket tally fell to 120 and his average climbed to 24.37. His total of wickets decreased further to 102 in 1929 and his average remained above 20. Hampered by another foot injury throughout 1930, Macaulay failed to take 100 wickets for the first time since his debut season; his average of 25.12 was the highest of his career.Hodgson, p. 128. In these seasons, he was only selected for one representative match, a Test trial in 1928 in which he failed to take a wicket. At the same time, his batting faded. In 1927, Macaulay scored his highest run aggregate and passed fifty six times while hitting 678 runs at an average of 25.11. He improved his batting average in 1928, accumulating 517 runs at 25.85 with four more fifties. However, after 1928, he never averaged more than 16.26 with the bat and only scored two more fifties in his career, both in 1929. End of first-class career =Return to form= From the 1931 season, Yorkshire once again dominated the County Championship, winning three consecutive trophies. A large part of the success was an increase in bowling strength. In 1931, Macaulay slightly increased his haul of wickets from 91 to 97, and his average dropped from 25.12 to 15.75. This placed him third in the Yorkshire averages, behind Hedley Verity and Bill Bowes, who both took over 100 wickets and led a very strong bowling attack.Woodhouse, p. 368. That season, Macaulay was awarded a benefit match against Surrey which raised ¬£1,633,Bowes, p. 72. worth approximately ¬£82,700 in 2008.Calculated using the Retail Price Index in ¬£ at, At the time, this was considered a poor reward for a Yorkshire cricketer. The following season, Macaulay took fewer wickets, managing 84 at an average of 19.07, which placed him fifth in the Yorkshire averages. He achieved his best bowling figures in first-class cricket when he took eight for 21 against the Indian touring side. By now, Macaulay was a specialist spinner and had largely abandoned pace bowling; Bill Bowes and Arthur Rhodes opened the Yorkshire bowling.Hodgson, p. 132. The 1933 season signalled a return to form for Macaulay. Wisden judged that he \\"recovered fully his length, spin and command over variations in pace\\". He bowled more overs than anyone else in the team and passed 100 wickets for the first time since 1929, the tenth and final time he did so, taking 148 wickets at an average of 16.45.Hodgson, p. 136. Against Northamptonshire, he took seven for nine as the team was bowled out for 27. He finished the match with thirteen for 34. Against Lancashire, when his match figures were twelve for 49, he took a hat-trick in a sequence of four wickets in five balls; he also took twelve wickets against Leicestershire. His form won a recall to the Test side after seven years. Not picked initially, a decision described by Wisden as unfair, he played in the first Test when E. W. Clark dropped out of the team before the match. Macaulay took one wicket in the first innings but had figures of four for 57 in the second innings to earn approval from Wisden. He was picked for the second Test but bowled only 14 overs before injuring his foot when fielding; he was unable to take any further part in the game. He did not play in the third Test but was selected in festival game at Scarborough for the team selected from the MCC party which toured Australia in the previous winter. He played instead of an injured player, even though he did not take part in the tour. Macaulay ended second in the Yorkshire bowling averages. In its review of the season, Wisden stated that his form in the early part of the season would have placed his among the best cricketers in the world. =Final seasons= Macaulay's final two seasons were affected by injury, as he was increasingly bothered by rheumatism.Hodgson, p. 138. In the 1934 season, while trying to take a catch, he injured the finger he used to spin the ball. He did not appear for Yorkshire until June, but went on to take 55 wickets at an average of 23.43. The next season was his final one. He only played nine matches, taking 22 wickets at 20.09. At the end of the year, he retired from first-class cricket and Yorkshire awarded him a special grant of ¬£250. Yorkshire did have a replacement in mind; Frank Smailes was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take Macaulay's place, but it was not until Ellis Robinson secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off-spinner was found.Hodgson, p. 145. Macaulay ended his career with 1,837 first-class wickets at an average of 17.65. In eight Test matches, he took 24 of those wickets at an average of 27.58. In addition, he scored 6,055 runs at an average of 18.07 and held 373 catches. He took 100 wickets in a season ten times, a record only surpassed by four others for Yorkshire, while only three other Yorkshire bowlers have taken 200 wickets in a season. He also took four hat-tricks. =Post-Yorkshire career= Following his retirement, Macaulay initially attempted to market a patented rheumatic medicine, but the business quickly failed. He then established an athletic outfitting shop in Leeds. This business also was unsuccessful; Macaulay blamed a lack of money and competition from other businesses. Consequently, he filed for bankruptcy in 1937. Macaulay accused Yorkshire of worsening his situation by withholding most of his benefit money‚Äîof the total raised, he received only ¬£530. He believed that he was owed the balance, and continued his business under that assumption, but Yorkshire had invested the amount and he only received the interest. The matter arose in court, and when asked why he thought the money would be paid to him, Macaulay answered: \\"Because I had earned it\\". He also rejected the accusation that he spent his time drinking in public houses, and another that he had neglected his two failed businesses. The Official Receiver found that Macaulay's complaint against Yorkshire was without justification. Macaulay suggested that he should arrange for the invested money to be paid to his creditors in his will. Macaulay secured new employment, and a few days after the hearing it was announced that he would play professional cricket in Wales. Macaulay played league cricket in Wales and Lancashire until the Second World War. During 1937, he was the professional at Ebbw Vale cricket club, and in 1938 and 1939, he played in the Lancashire League as the professional for Todmorden, for whom he took nine wickets for 10 runs against Ramsbottom in the Worsley Cup final. Ramsbottom were bowled out for 47 to give Macaulay's team a 26-run win.Woodhouse, pp. 306‚Äì07. When the Second World War began, Macaulay joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) Volunteer Reserve in 1940 as a Pilot Officer, and was stationed at Church Fenton, close to Barkston Ash where he lived with his wife Edith. Later in the year, he was stationed in the Shetland Islands, where he was bothered by the cold.Pope, pp. 166‚Äì67. Six days after his 43rd birthday, he died of pneumonia at the Sullom Voe RAF station on 13 December 1940. He was buried in Lerwick Cemetery in Shetland.Woodhouse, p. 307.Swanton, p. 61. Style and personality As a batsman, Macaulay was reasonably good and possibly better than his statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team.Marshall, p. 38. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling. As a bowler, Macaulay fulfilled two roles. At the start of an innings, when the ball was new and hard, he opened the bowling with medium-fast deliveries that swung away from right-handed batsmen. In this style, he was very accurate and bowled a variety of deliveries to unsettle his opponents. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow considered him to be better than any similar bowler in the 1920s except Maurice Tate, the leading medium paced bowler in England.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 136. Macaulay could vary his pace from medium to fast depending on the needs of the match situation and the type of pitch.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 135. When the pitch was suitable for spinning the ball, he bowled medium-paced off breaks. Wisden said that his spin made him more effective than other bowlers of his speed on a sticky wicket, a pitch which has been affected by rain, making it erratic and difficult to bat on. His obituary further stated: \\"Under suitable conditions for using the off- break, batsmen seemed at his mercy.\\" This was because he could bowl deliveries which were almost impossible for batsmen to play without getting out, but at the same time it was very difficult to score runs against him. Robertson- Glasgow wrote that \\"on a rain-damaged pitch he was in his glory.\\" He would make small adjustments to the positions of his fielders or bowl from different sides of the wicket, often making gestures or facial expressions as he did so. Robertson-Glasgow said that \\"only the best could survive the onslaught except by a miracle\\", and described Macaulay as a great bowler. The cricket writer Jim Kilburn suggested that Macaulay was \\"a great cricketer. He was great not so much in mathematical accomplishment ... as in cricketing character.\\" Macaulay's bowling action was relaxed and effortless, being admired by his contemporaries. Kilburn wrote: \\"His run-up was half-shambling, his steps short and his shoulders swaying, but his feet were faultlessly placed and his aim was high at the instant of delivery\\". However, critics and team-mates more widely knew him as passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling. Kilburn said that batsmen were Macaulay's \\"mortal enemies\\". He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them, including the tactic of bowling the ball straight at their head without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair.Bowes, pp. 29‚Äì30. Kilburn observed that \\"should the batsman survive he would be rewarded with a glare of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but the stoutest heart ... Every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled. He never gave up and his persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later\\". The Yorkshire Post, after his death, observed: \\"Macaulay will always be remembered for the fierceness of his enthusiasm when there was a fighting chance of victory\\".Quoted in Pope, p. 167. Macaulay displayed a temper when matters went against him. Robertson-Glasgow described him as an unusual man, \\"fiercely independent, witty, argumentative, swift to joy and anger. He had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy ... A cricket-bag came between him and his blazer hanging on a peg; and he'd kick it and tell it a truth or two, then laugh.\\" Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be \\"filled with a devilish energy\\".Bowes, p. 64. He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him.Hodgson, p. 109.Bowes, pp. 76‚Äì77. Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a good shot from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were never sure what to expect from him, even after playing with him for years.Bowes, p. 81. Herbert Sutcliffe said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp. Robertson- Glasgow nevertheless described him as \\"a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand\\".

Operations were based in Concord, California in the back offices of The Screem, a music club operated by Tate. They only carried Christian bands and considered themselves to be a Christian ministry. Most records were produced by Masaki Liu at Masaki's One Way Studio and executive produced by Frank Tate. Operations Records released under 5 Minute Walk were distributed by Diamante Music Group until September 1998. They then struck a deal with Forefront Records to distribute through EMI-owned Chordant Distribution in Christian markets and directly by EMI Distribution in mainstream markets. They also had a sublabel, SaraBellum Records, founded in 1997. Records released on the SaraBellum imprint were targeted at the general market, and distributed by the Warner Music Group. Albums were often released on both labels simultaneously. Sarabellum was folded back into 5 Minute Walk in 2001 as the label changed distribution to EMI. Their first release was Deeper Than Skies by My Brother's Mother in 1995. In approximately 2001 the label dropped all artists from its roster except Five Iron Frenzy. When Five Iron disbanded at the end of 2003, lead singer Reese Roper signed under the name \\"Roper.\\" The group released one album, Brace Yourself for the Mediocre, in late 2004 and toured nationally before disbanding. Ministry Many of their records and tours raised money for charity causes. Artists involved in these tours sometimes played without payment, and included off-label bands such as Sixpence None the Richer, the Lost Dogs, and Poor Old Lu. These operations were at the direction of Frank Tate who, previous to the label's founding and as manager for The Prayer Chain and The 77s, raised money to send 72 HIV infected children to Disneyland. Tours often took donations such as socks, blankets, and jackets and gave the collections to local homeless shelters. Certain albums raised money for world hunger related causes. The company also ran a food and medical center in Tijuana, Mexico that fed upwards of 150 children each day and contributed to an orphanage in Tijuana. Five Minute Walk tours were not restricted to \\"christian friendly\\" venues such as churches, as bars and non-traditional venues such as roller skating rinks were considered ministry opportunities. Typically their bands would not preach to the crowds, but let the music carry the message to the listener. The approach of the label was to ensure the bands were spiritually healthy so that they could effectively transmit the Gospel message. The labels lyrical approach, as explained by Frank Tate, was \\"...if you search the lyrics and ponder what they're saying, you'll hear the hope that they've found. But you're not going to come to one of our shows and get banged over the head with a Bible.\\" Five Iron Frenzy participated in the 1998 Ska Against Racism tour, which raised awareness of and money for anti-racism causes. Five Iron also participated in the Vans Warped Tour in 2002.

The plot involves the trapping of a gangster on the run in Algiers, who believes he is safe from arrest in the Casbah. It was considered experimental for its day, and is credited with having inspired The Third Man. Background The film depicts a gangster nicknamed P√©p√© le Moko. Moko is slang for a man from Toulon, derived from the Occitan amb aqu√≤ (\\"with that\\"), a term which punctuates sentences in Provence and which, in Toulon, is pronounced em'oqu√≤. The film is based on Henri La Barthe's novel of the same name, and La Barthe contributed to the screenplay under the pseudonym D√©tective Ashelb√©. The sets were designed by the art director Jacques Krauss. P√©p√© le Moko is an example of the 1930s French movement known as poetic realism, which combines realism with occasional flashes of unusual cinematic tricks. It often is considered a predecessor of film noir. Plot P√©p√© le Moko (Jean Gabin), a criminal on the run from the police in metropolitan France, lives in the Casbah quarter of Algiers with his gang, where he is out of reach of the local police. Inspector Slimane (Lucas Gridoux) seeks a way to lure P√©p√© out of his refuge. He sees his chance when he learns that P√©p√© is in love with Gaby (Mireille Balin), the mistress of a rich businessman. Slimane leads Gaby to believe that P√©p√© has been killed. Gaby, who was on the point of joining him in his hiding place, now agrees to stay with her rich lover. When P√©p√© is informed that Gaby is about to leave Algiers for good, then he leaves the Casbah to find her and is arrested.

Metacritic reports a score of 98, based on 12 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". English author Graham Greene in a review of the film for The Spectator asserted: \\"One of the most exciting and moving films I can remember seeing\\". It succeeds in \\"raising the thriller to a poetic level\\". According to a BBC documentary, it served as inspiration for Greene's screenplay for The Third Man. It has many similarities with the American film Casablanca, which was released a few years later. Remakes The film was remade in America in 1938 as Algiers, starring Hedy Lamarr and Charles Boyer, and again in 1948 as Casbah, a musical starring Tony Martin, M√§rta Tor√©n, Yvonne de Carlo, and Peter Lorre.

Muttulakshmi Reddy was appointed to the Madras Legislative Council in 1926. This nomination marked the beginning of her lifelong effort to \\"correct the balance for women by removing social abuses and working for equality in moral standards‚Ä≥. She was a women's activist and social reformer. She had a number of firsts to her name: the first female student to be admitted into a men's college, the first woman House Surgeon in the Government Maternity and Ophthalmic Hospital, the first woman Legislator in British India, the first Chairperson of the State Social Welfare Advisory Board, the first woman Deputy President of the Legislative Council, and the first Alderwoman of the Madras Corporation Avvai Home. Reddy was born in the princely state of Pudukkottai of Tamil Nadu. In spite of various constraints faced by girls in India of her time, she completed her higher education and was admitted into the medical profession. In 1907, she joined the Madras Medical College, where she achieved a brilliant academic record. With several gold medals and prizes to her credit, Reddy graduated in 1912 to become one of the first female doctors in India. Soon after, she came under the influence of Annie Besant, and then of Mahatma Gandhi. Madras medical college ‚Äì history Her father was S. Narayanaswami Iyer, the Principal of Maharaja's College. Her mother was Chandrammal, a Devadasi. Her father was ostracised from his family because of his marriage to a Devadasi. She developed a close relationship with the maternal side of her family, and this closeness made her very perceptive of the Devadasi community and their issues. Narayanaswami Iyer broke the tradition and sent Muthulakshmi to school. Her enthusiasm for learning was so great that Muthulakshmi's teachers decided to instruct her in subjects beyond those approved by her father. At the onset of puberty, she was obliged to leave school, but tutoring continued at home. Chandrammal wanted to search for a bridegroom but Muthulakshmi had different aspirations. She expressed a need to be different from the common lot. She was against the subordination of women to men and rebelled whenever she heard people say that only boys needed education. When Reddy passed the Matriculation exam she applied for admission to Maharaja's College but her application was not welcomed by the Principal or the parents of other students. Her gender was a factor as was her background. The Principal thought she might \\"demoralize\\" the male students. The somewhat enlightened Maharaja of Pudukottai ignored these objections, admitted her to the college, and gave her a scholarship. Her father suggested that she can become a school teacher but she had higher aspirations. She entered Madras Medical College, completed her studies in 1912, and became House Surgeon in the Government Hospital for Women and Children in Chennai. She later married Sundara Reddy with the proviso that he promised to \\"always respect me as an equal and never cross my wishes.\\" In 1914, when she was twenty-eight years of age, they married in accordance with the 1872 Native Marriage Act. Famous Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan is the son of Muthulakshmi Reddy's brother Ramasamy. Influences  Title page of My Experiences as a Legislator (1930) During her college years, Muthulakshmi met Sarojini Naidu and began to attend women's meetings. She found women who shared her concerns and addressed them in terms of women's rights. The two great personalities who influenced her life were Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. They persuaded her to devote herself to uplifting women and children. She worked for women's emancipation at a time when women were confined in the four walls of their room.  Activism  She went to England for higher studies and she gave up her rewarding practice in medicine in response to a request from the Women's Indian Association (WIA) to enter the Madras Legislative Council. She was elected unanimously as its deputy president. She led the agitation for the municipal and legislative franchise for women. She was concerned about the orphans, especially girls. She arranged for them free boarding and lodging and started the Avvai Home in Chennai. Reddy was the author of numerous social reforms. Her book My Experience as a Legislator records her service. She passed a resolution to establish a special hospital for women and children. The government accepted her suggestion and opened a children's section in the maternity hospital. She recommended systematic medical inspection of students in all schools and colleges, run by municipalities as well as other local bodies. Kasturba Hospital at Triplicane is a monument to her efforts. She was the president of the All-India Women's Conference. She passed the bill for the suppression of brothels and immoral trafficking in women and children. A home for girls and women was opened through her efforts to provide shelter to those rescued from brothels. Due to her efforts, a hostel for Muslim girls was opened and scholarships were given for Harijan girls. She recommended to the government that the minimum age for marriage be raised to at least 21 for boys and 16 for girls. Reddy also started the Cancer Relief Fund. This has now developed into an all-India institution combining therapy and research on cancer and attracting patients from all over India. She became the first chairperson of the State Social Welfare Board. Her work on the Hartog Education Committee, which incorporated a study of educational progress in India, is a great achievement. As a member of this committee, she travelled extensively and studied the progress of women's education throughout the country. She was the only female member of the committee and brought about many improvements. She was also the editor of Roshini, an important journal of AIWC. She continued to fight for her cause till the end of her days and never let anything stand in her way. Even at the age of 80, she was energetic and vibrant. Her human preoccupations took her away from politics and she stuck to her mission and Gandhian ways. She was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the President of India in 1956. Her two outstanding monumental gifts for India remain the Avvai Home (for children) and the Cancer Institute. Political career She was nominated by Sakthi Hari Haran to the Madras Legislature as a member of the legislative council in 1927 and became the first woman to be a member of any legislature in India. When she was elected as the deputy chairperson of the legislative council, she became the first woman in the world to become the vice president of a legislature. She was the prime mover behind the legislation that abolished the Devadasi system and played a keen role in raising the minimum marriage age for women in India. In 1930, she resigned from the Madras Legislature as a protest following the imprisonment of Mahatma Gandhi. She argued for the removal of the Devadasi system that was widely prevalent in Tamil Nadu at that time against stiff resistance from the Congress lobby led by Dheerar Sathyamoorthy, also from Pudhukkottai. She was the founder-president of the Women's Indian Association (WIA) and became the first alderwoman of the Madras Corporation. Reddy was active in setting up of several toilets and women's toilets and initiated measures to improve the medical facilities given to slum dwellers. In 1930, she founded Avvai Illam =Adyar Cancer Institute= During her address at the Centenary celebration of 1935, she declared her desire to start a hospital for cancer patients. The foundation stone for Adyar Cancer Institute was laid by former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1952. The hospital, which started functioning on 18 June 1954, was the second of its kind in India. Today it treats nearly 80,000 cancer patients a year.Adyar Cancer institute Awards and books Her book My Experience as a Legislator recounts her initiatives in respect of social reforms taken by her in the Madras Legislature. Government of India conferred on her Padma Bhushan in 1956 in recognition of her meritorious services to the nation. Reddi inspired an award that is given to women who have given service in cancer prevention. Tribute On 30 July 2019, Google showed a Doodle celebrating what would have been her 133rd birthday.

The club was founded in 1949 by Jack Speare and Ernie Dixon. The club started with one junior team, playing out of Moore Park, Indooroopilly and moved to the Indooroopilly Recreation Reserve (now named Jack Speare Park) at Fairley Street Indooroopilly, in 1955. Taringa Rovers may be the oldest club in its original form and still using its original name that has played continuously in the Brisbane senior competitions. The club has remained in the top division of the Brisbane competition (the Brisbane Premier League) longer than any other club currently in that division, having been in the division continuously since its promotion in 1983, until a decision by Football Brisbane to offer places to clubs based on criteria of facilities and juniors saw the club relegated to the Capital League in 2013 Promotion back to the Premier League for 2015 was sealed with a second-place finish. The club has won this league once, in 1993 (see Football Brisbane Men's Competition Archive) 2009 season The 2009 season was one of frustration for the first team, with injuries causing many headaches for the coaching staff. Senior players Nick Kuyper and Tom Guttormsen missed almost the whole season and Luke Harper succumbed to a serious knee injury after round 14. However, it was with goalkeepers where the team had most issues, using nine different keepers during the season, due to injuries. Despite this, the young squad kept to their task and finished the league in 9th position. 2010 season A new grandstand was built and the playing field re-surfaced for season 2010. Taringa started the season woefully, and looked likely to be relegated after a long winless streak. However coach Joe Fenech turned the team around as they fought back to finish 11th out of 14 teams in the Brisbane Premier League. The club will be remembered by others in 2010 for scoring an average of more than 2 goals per game, while conceding more than 3 goals per game, making matches involving Taringa an often exciting affair. 2011 season Of the club's 13 senior teams, 8 played semi-finals. Four of the teams were successful in reaching their competitions Grand Finals, with only the U21s being successful, defeating Souths Utd 3‚Äì2 aet. The Women's Division 1 team were crowned Premiers with three rounds still to be played. Matt Biggins was named as the Brisbane Men's Premier League Players Player of the Year. 2012 season Of the club's 14 senior & 6 competitive junior teams, 7 teams competed in semi- finals of which 3 teams, the U12 division 3, U14 division 3 and Women's Division 4 teams making their respective finals. The U 12 Division 3 lost 2‚Äì1 but the U 14 Division 3 and the Women's Division 4 both won 5‚Äì0 and 4‚Äì0 respectively. Taringa Rovers top women's team competed at the top level, Diamond League formerly Women's Premier League, for the first time in the club's history having won Division 1 last year. Nick Tubbs was named Goalkeeper in the Brisbane Men's Premier Select Team. 2013 With the revamping of the Men's Brisbane Premier League, after a record 30 continuous years in the top flight, Taringa Rovers SFC was controversially omitted and relegated to the second tier of football, Capital League 1. The major outcome was a substantial loss of junior players to nearby clubs in the BPL. The club has now entered a rebuilding phase with plans to return to the BPL in the near future. The women's Diamond League team maintained their top flight status for the 2014 season. 2014 After a successful season the Capital 1 team finished second with a late winner away against Annerley in the final game of the season. This booked the club's place in the BPL for the 2015 season. The team then, two days later, went to Premiers Mitchelton for the first semi- final and came away with 2‚Äì0 win to book their place in the Grand Final. A very late equaliser from Jesse Devereaux and then some brilliant penalty saves from Douglas Blaikie saw Taringa Rovers walk away with the trophy 3‚Äì1 on penalties. 2015 BPL squad was assembled and coach Mick Matthews was happy with what he had assembled. However, by the midpoint of the season it was clear they were short a few premier league hardened players and were also lacking that one player of real quality who could lift the rest of the team. The club was relegated back to the Capital 1 competition after just one season back.

Founded by Leonard Koren in 1976 it ran thirty-four issues before closing in 1981. The idea for the magazine grew out of the artwork Leonard Koren was doing at the time‚Äîwhat he termed ‚Äòbath art‚Äô‚Äîand followed on the heels of a party he threw at the Pico-Burnside Baths. As Kristine McKenna, music editor for WET from 1979 until 1981, wrote: \\"The world wasn‚Äôt crying out for a periodical on bathing when Leonard Koren introduced Wet magazine in 1976. However, Koren had the imagination and audacity to create his own world, and that‚Äôs exactly what he did with Wet: The Magazine of Gourmet Bathing.\\" WET covered a range of cultural issues and was widely known for its use of graphic art. Started as a simple one-man operation that included artwork and text solicited from friends and acquaintances, the production, team, and circulation of the magazine would grow over the years. Its content also evolved to cover a wider expanse of stories that captured a Los Angeles attitude that was emerging at the same time as punk, but with its own distinct aesthetic. As design problems arose, solutions were often improvised on the spot. Its layout and design helped to catalyze the graphic styles later known as New Wave and Postmodern. In a letter he wrote on August 25, 1988, Tibor Kalman, president of M&Co.; wrote that WET \\"is one of the most important and well-designed magazines in U.S. design history.\\" It's important to note that WET made household names of Laurie Anderson, David Lynch and others with its interviews. It also covered the novel (at the time) aesthetic of taking care of one's body, per nutrition, such as introducing wheatgrass juice to a broader public. Stylized fashion photography brought the concept of toddlers with mohawks and a punked out version of modern Americana, transforming mindsets among its varied readers. Throughout its production, WET continued to draw from a variety of artists and contributors. Contributing photographers included Eric Blum, Moshe Brakha, Guy Fery, Jim Ganzer, Brian Hagiwara, Brian Leatart, Jacques-Henri Latrigue, Dana Levy, Claude Mougin, Beverly Parker, Lisa Powers, Herb Ritts, Matthew Rolston, Raul Vega, Guy Webster, and Penny Wolin. WET also included artwork by Rip Georges, April Greiman, Matt Groening, Jim Heimann, Thomas Ingalls, Kim Jones, Jayme Odgers, Taki Ono, Futzie Nutzle, Gary Panter, Peter Shire, John Van Hamersveld, David Jordan Williams, Teruhiko Yumura, and Bob Zoell. The 1980s January/February edition of WET featured a photo Richard Gere by Larry Williams on its cover. In April 2012, Leonard Koren released Making WET: The Magazine of Gourmet Bathing.

The restricted sunlight of the forest type require a number of basking sites to be available. It is less frequently found in other types of environs, such as the open eucalypt woodland of the region. The lizards shelter in hollow logs or burrows. Often these are dug into the soil-bound root systems of fallen trees. Behaviour Land mullets are normally reported to be very shy, dashing noisily to the cover of dense low vegetation if disturbed. However, in some popular National Parks, the lizards have become habituated - scavenging close to humans for scraps at picnic and camping sites. Reproduction Land mullets are live-bearing reptiles which usually reproduce roughly 4 to 9 independent offspring per litter. Largely solitary, they primarily associate only when it is time to mate. Diet The land mullet eats woody fungi, mushrooms, berries, seeds, insects such as beetles and grasshoppers as well as decaying fruit material  References  External links * Morphology and natural history of the Land Mullet Egernia major (Squamata: Scincidae) * Australian Reptile Park Category:Skinks of Australia Category:Reptiles described in 1845 Category:Bellatorias ","title":"Land mullet"},{"id":"3645390","text":"George Edward Charles Wood (22 August 1893 ‚Äì 18 March 1971) was an English cricketer who played in 3 Test matches in 1924. A wicket keeper who habitually stood up to the stumps against all styles of bowling, he was educated at Cheltenham College and Pembroke College, Cambridge and played first-class cricket for Cambridge University from 1913 to 1920. He won Blues both before and after the First World War and proved his all round sporting talent by also gaining Blues in hockey and rugby. He made his debut for Kent in 1919, winning his cap in 1920, and played for the county until 1927. He turned down an invitation to tour Australia in 1920/21 but played for the amateur team led by Archie MacLaren which defeated the Australians in 1921. He also appeared in matches for Marylebone Cricket Club from 1924 to 1932, and, with a smattering of matches for L Robinson's XI (1913-1921), the Gentlemen (1920-1932), South of England (1920), Free Foresters (1921-1928), England XI (1921), CI Thornton's XI (1921), The Rest of England (1923) and HDG Leveson-Gower's XI (1936) made 101 first-class appearances in all. A right-handed lower order batsman, promoted on occasion to open. his only first-class century, 128, came against Free Foresters. His three tests were played against the touring South Africans in 1924. The first was the remarkable match at Edgbaston in June which saw South Africa bowled out for just 30 in reply to England's imposing 438. The tourists rallied in their second innings, posting 390, to lose by an innings and 18 runs in the three day match. Batting at number 10, Wood contributed just a single on debut before being bowled by Parker, and caught Dave Nourse from the bowling of Arthur Gilligan when South Africa followed on. England won the second Test at Lords by exactly the same margin, thanks to a double century by Jack Hobbs and centuries from Sutcliffe and Woolley. Wood caught South Africa's captain Herbie Taylor for 4, again from the bowling of Gilligan. Wood's last Test match was the third in the series, played at Headingley in July, which England again won in convincing style. Although run out for just 6, Wood took 3 catches and completed a stumping as England ran out winners by 9 wickets.

He worked as an anthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was a senior lecturer at the time of his assassination. Webster was a founding member of the Detainees' Parents' Support Committee (DPSC) in 1981, a founder member of the Five Freedoms Forum, and a committed comrade in the United Democratic Front. Webster was also an active member of the Orlando Pirates supporters' club and he assisted in the mobilisation and organisation of South African musicians during the Struggle in the 1980s. He was a long-term ethnographic researcher and his work near Kosi Bay on the Mozambican border resulted in a number of peer-reviewed academic publications. Webster was assassinated by apartheid security forces outside his home on 1 May 1989. Early years David Joseph Webster was born in 1944 in Northern Rhodesia, where his father worked as a miner in the Copperbelt. He studied at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, where he was involved in student politics. In 1970, Webster started teaching anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand. His doctorate had been written on a traditional topic of anthropology (kinship), but it was focused on a politically explosive field, namely migrant workers from Mozambique. In 1976, he taught for two years with Peter Worsley at the University of Manchester. Webster was active in the political anti-apartheid movement, especially in the 1980s for the Detainees' Parents' Support Committee, an organisation advocating the release of political detainees held without trial in South Africa. Assassination Webster was shot dead outside his house at 13 Eleanor Street in Troyeville, Johannesburg, by assassins in the employ of the Civil Cooperation Bureau, a clandestine agency of the apartheid state.\\"The night Ferdi Barnard told me he killed\\", Nov 21 1997, Mail & Guardian The hit squad was paid R40,000 (at the time, equivalent to about US$8,000) for his murder. Ferdi Barnard, the man who pulled the trigger on the shotgun used, was later tried and found guilty in 1998; he was sentenced to two life terms plus 63 years for a number of crimes, including the murder of Webster.\\"Ferdi Barnard is found guilty of killing Webster\\", sahistory.org.za Barnard was released from prison on April 2, 2019, after his parole was approved by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha in March 2019. Thousands of people attended his funeral service at St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg. Personal life Dr Webster was an active member of the Orlando Pirates supporters' club. Members of the supporters' club formed a guard of honour around his coffin at his funeral. Legacy The house in Troyeville where Webster lived with his partner Maggie Friedman has been declared a heritage site. On the site of his assassination outside David Webster House there is a mosaic that includes the words \\"Assassinated here for his fight against apartheid. Lived for justice, peace and friendship\\". A nearby park in Clarence Street (previously called Bloemenhof Park) was renamed the David Webster Park on the 20th anniversary of his death. There is also a mosaic in the park by Jacob Ramaboya from the Spaza Gallery which commemorates his life. In 1992, the University of the Witwatersrand named a new Hall of Residence Webster's honour.

He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the seventh round of the 2002 NFL Draft after playing college football at North Carolina. Curry was also briefly a member of the Detroit Lions and St. Louis Rams. Early years Curry was born in Hampton, Virginia. At Hampton High School in Hampton, Virginia, Curry was an All-American in basketball and football and was awarded the Dial Award for the national high-school scholar-athlete of the year in 1997. He won the McDonald's Slam Dunk contest and was MVP of the McDonald's All-American game. By most reports, his high school football coach favored Curry attending the University of Virginia and focusing on football, while his high school basketball coach favored the University of North Carolina to develop Curry into a prospect for the NBA. He verbally committed to play both basketball and football to Virginia before signing instead with rival North Carolina. This made him a very unpopular figure among Virginia fans, who referred to him by such terms as \\"Benedict Curry\\", \\"Benedict Ronald\\", or \\"WHN\\" (an abbreviation of \\"What's his name?\\"), and voted to make him the \\"Sports Jerk of the Year\\" in the Tank McNamara comic strip. Coincidentally, Curry's cousin Almondo \\"Muffin\\" Curry, a cornerback, later decided to attend Virginia. Ronald Curry broke several Virginia high school football records while attending Hampton High School. He is considered one of the greatest Virginia high school athletes ever, leading his school to three consecutive state titles in football from 1995 to 1997 and one in basketball in 1998. The 1996 Hampton High School football team went 14‚Äì0, outscoring opponents 768‚Äì83 including a 51‚Äì0 victory over a previously unbeaten Patrick Henry team in the state championship, and is widely considered to be the best team in Virginia history; the 1997 team also went 14‚Äì0 and posted similar numbers. Curry also excelled at defensive back and kick returner in addition to his quarterbacking duties. Michael Vick was in the same district as Curry in high school and was overshadowed by the accomplishments of Curry's team. While Vick was also a highly touted prospect, Curry was almost universally rated higher in recruiting rankings. In an interview, Vick said \\"I felt pressure to compete against Ronald Curry.\\" One college football recruiting analyst says Curry was the best offensive prospect he saw in 23 years. College career At North Carolina, Curry set many records including most career passing yards and most career total yards. He was twice named the most valuable player of post-season bowl games, doing so at the 1998 Las Vegas Bowl and the 2001 Peach Bowl. He also played basketball for two years along with Carolina Panthers defensive end Julius Peppers. Curry went through multiple football coaching changes. He played under 3 different offensive coordinators. In his senior season, his position coach was Gary Tranquill, who had joined the Tar Heels in 2001 after leaving the Virginia staff when Al Groh became coach. Professional career =2002 NFL Draft= Curry was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the 7th round of the 2002 NFL Draft with the 235th overall pick as a quarterback.2002 NFL Draft www.nfl.com, Retrieved March 27, 2015 =Oakland Raiders= Curry made his professional regular season debut on November 3, 2002, in a 23-20 loss to cross-town rival San Francisco 49ers. In that game, Curry lost one fumble. During the preseason, Curry played in three games and lost three fumbles. He played all 16 games of the 2003 season, including two starts, and made five receptions for 31 yards. In 2004, as the number 3 receiver behind Jerry Porter, he hauled in 50 receptions for 679 yards before injuring his Achilles tendon. Before his injury Curry's highlights included 10 receptions in a game against the Colts, a Raiders' season high. He recorded his first 100-yard receiving game with 110 yards on six catches in Week 11 at Denver, then followed that up with a nine- catch, 141-yard performance the next week against Kansas City. He also won the Levitra NFL Play of the Week for his leaping, twisting, one-handed grab in the back of the end zone at Denver in a snowstorm. After an extensive off-season rehabilitation program to repair his torn tendon, Curry unfortunately re- injured the same tendon in week 2 of the 2005 season against the Chiefs and was lost for the rest of the year. Curry returned in 2006 and proved to be one of the few bright spots on an abysmal 2-14 last-place Raiders team. He led the team in receiving yards and receptions and had one touchdown while only starting a few games. During the 2006 offseason Curry signed a new 5-year $20 million contract. In 2007 as a starter in Oakland, he opened the regular season with a 10 catch, 133-yard and one touchdown performance. Curry again underwent surgery on his foot in May 2008 and missed the team's first mandatory minicamp on June 3‚Äì5.JaSkinny Russell, Curry surgery and more OTA news In the season opener on Monday Night Football (September 8, 2008), Curry would catch a 4-yard touchdown reception in the team's lopsided loss to the Denver Broncos. After a loss to the New Orleans Saints on October 12, Curry was benched in favor of rookie receiver Chaz Schilens. However, after an injury to Schilens, Curry started against the Miami Dolphins on November 16. Curry on that day caught 6 passes for 73 yards and the following week against the Denver Broncos lined up in the Wildcat formation in the shotgun stance; however, no receiver was open and Curry ran it out of bounds for a gain of one yard. Curry was released by the Oakland Raiders on February 18, 2009. =Detroit Lions= Curry was signed by the Detroit Lions on April 16, 2009. =St. Louis Rams= On July 22, 2009, Curry was acquired by the St. Louis Rams from the Lions in a trade for defensive tackle Orien Harris. The Rams released Curry on September 5, 2009. Coaching career =San Francisco 49ers= From 2014‚Äì2015, Curry was an offensive assistant with the San Francisco 49ers, until he was let go after the 2015 season due to a coaching overhaul. =New Orleans Saints= On February 3, 2016, Curry joined the New Orleans Saints as an offensive assistant. Personal life Curry was raised by his grandparents until Mattie Curry, his grandmother, became too ill to parent him full-time. Ron and Almondo Curry were then taken in by Lillian Crawford, the great-grandmother of their very good friend Kenneth Crawford. The Currys remained very close to their grandmother until her death in October 2000, days before a UNC football game against Virginia ‚Äì the school that Curry declined to attend in favor of UNC after initially committing. Curry then met a fellow UNC student, junior Stacie Jones, and in March 2001 they became engaged. They married not long after he moved to Oakland after being drafted by the Raiders. In July 2004, they had their first child, a daughter, Raley Camille Curry. Their second daughter, Emery Mattie, followed 4 years later. On February 23, 2010, they had their third child (and first son), Carter Wallace Curry.

It was founded in 1963 by the labor leader Juan Lech√≠n Oquendo and by Mario Torres Calleja and Edwin Moller in lesser roles. The PRIN seceded from the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) in protest against V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro's decision to seek a third elected term as president in 1964, rather than permit then Vice-President Juan Lech√≠n to have the MNR's presidential nomination.Political parties of the Americas: Canada, Latin America, and the West Indies. Greenwood Press, 1982. P. 143. The PRIN combined the left wing of the MNR and former members of the Revolutionary Workers' Party (POR). The PRIN's ideological position espouses left-wing nationalism, rather than socialism in more traditional terms. It is critical of bourgeois influence in the main body of the MNR. Electorally, the PRIN abstained in the 1964 and 1966 presidential votes. After the military coup of 1964, the PRIN was forced underground. It was also weakened because Juan Lech√≠n was deported to Paraguay by the military junta, he spent many years in exile between 1965 and 1978.Political parties of the world. Longman, 1988. P. 68. The PRIN was once again suppressed in the 1970s by the military under the presidency of Hugo Banzer. After 1971, its position as the main party to the left of the MNR was supplanted by a new party formed by Hern√°n Siles, the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement of the Left (MNRI).

He was the youngest of four brothers who all played for Lancashire, but were unrelated to the Worsley family that produced the two famous brothers Johnny and Ernest Tyldesley. Dick first played for Lancashire in 1919 and, with Dean out of form and Cook still in the Army, gained a regular place as a slow bowler. Though he kept a perfect length and could flight the ball extremely well, at this early stage Tyldesley had so little spin that he was not a deadly force on sticky wickets. He also showed promise as a hard-hitting batsman and demonstrated his ability as a close-catching field.Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden Cricketers' Almanac, Fifty-Seventh Edition (1920); p. 112 By 1921, he was one of the leading bowlers for Lancashire, and in 1922, gaining more spin on the ball on sticky wickets, Dick Tyldesley took 100 first-class wickets. He also hit up 105 against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford and remarkably was Lancashire's fourth-highest run-scorer - though with less than half the aggregates of Ernest Tyldesley, Hallows and Makepeace.Pardon; John Wisden Cricketers' Almanac; Sixtieth Edition (1923); pp. 126-127 It was from 1923, however, that he leaped to the top of the tree though increasing his finger spin to make him a deadly bowler on the many sticky pitches found in the North. He took 140 wickets that year, and in 1924 - a summer so wet that only one Lancashire match was played throughout on a pitch unaffected by rain - he was consistently deadly except against the most exceptionally skilled batsmen. His record that summer won him a place on the Ashes tour of 1924/1925, but he was a dreadful failure on the cast-iron Australian wickets where the ball came straight through. His wickets for the whole tour cost 41 runs apiece - a remarkable contrast to his record in England! However, at home Tyldesley maintained his form as a bowler exceptionally well, and after a slight lapse in 1927 and 1928 he was back at his best in 1929, heading the bowling averages and invariably proving unplayable after showers in a very dry summer. With Australian paceman Ted McDonald, Tyldesley formed a bowling combination that was sufficient to give Lancashire a hat-trick of Championship wins between 1926 and 1928: during these three years McDonald took 484 wickets and Tyldesley 303 - though Tyldesley actually had a better average. As a batsman, though, Dick Tyldesley declined to the point of only making two fifties after 1926. In 1930 Tyldesley took 121 wickets for under 15 each and played a vital role in Lancashire's fourth Championship in five years. He was recalled to the Test side with only moderate success, but remained Lancashire's leading bowler in 1931. Unfortunately, that was to prove his last season of county cricket because of a dispute with the committee. He played for some years in the Lancashire League, as professional for Haslingden (1932), East Lancashire (1933), Accrington (1934‚Äì35) and Lowerhouse (1936) and was then landlord of the Dog and Pheasant pub at Wingates, Westhoughton. He played one more first-class match, for Sir L Parkinson's XI v Leicestershire, at Blackpool, in 1935. Often viewed as overweight, he died at the young age of forty-six in 1943.

Using very small (32mm diameter) disks enclosed in a protective cartridge storing 250MB per side, DataPlay was intended primarily for portable music playback, although it could also store other types of data, using both pre-recorded disks and user-recorded disks (and disks that combined pre-recorded information with a writable area). It would also allow for multisession recording. It won the CES Best of Show award in 2001. DataPlay also included an elaborate digital rights management system designed to allow consumers to \\"unlock\\" extra pre-recorded content on the disk at any time, through the internet, following the initial purchase. It was based on the Secure Digital Music Initiative's DRM system. Dataplay's DRM system was one of the reasons behind its atractiveness to the music industry. It also included a proprietary file system, Dataplay File System (DFS) which natively supported DRM. By default it would allow up to 3 copies to other Dataplay discs, without allowing any copies to CDs. The recorded music industry was initially generally supportive of DataPlay and a small number of a pre-recorded DataPlay disks were released, including the Britney Spears album Britney. However, as a pre-recorded format, DataPlay was a failure. The company closed due to a lack of funding. In 2003 a company called DPHI bought Dataplay's intellectual property and reintroduced it at CES 2004. The company swapped Dataplay's DFS file system in favor of the FAT file system. Again, they were marketed as a cheaper alternative to memory cards, with a device having been designed that would allow users to transfer data from an SD card to a cheaper and higher capacity Dataplay disc. Each disc would hold 500 megabytes of data and be sold at just US$4.50. DPHI also prototyped 750 megabyte Dataplay discs and announced plans for 2 and 7 gigabyte discs, the latter of which would use a blue-violet semiconductor laser, just like Blu- ray. There were very few products seen on the market that could write data to these discs. Most notable was the Topy Mini Writer, which retailed for $130 (USD) and housed an optical pickup unit (image No.4) with a USB interface board, allowing the use of DataPlay discs much like other end-user writable optical media (e.g., CD-Rs). Other products were the iriver IDP-100 and the MTV Video Device \\"MTV FLIP\\", which both housed the prototype-based model (image No.2). Dataplay discs were first proposed as a low cost alternative to memory cards, which used to cost US$1 per megabyte. Blank Dataplay discs, by comparison, would hold 500 megabytes of data at US$10 per disc. They are also expected to have a 100-year lifespan. The discs would be made out of polycarbonate, just like CDs, but would be just 0.6mm thick, just like one half of a DVD. (DVDs are made up of two layers that are bonded using glue; usually only one (side) contains data)Rewritable Dataplay discs would be similar to CDs, using a phase change alloy protected by a Silicon Oxide layer. Mastered (replicated) Dataplay discs would combine both pits and lands to store mastered data, and grooves containing a wobble frequency to store rewritable data. Just like on CDs, the wobble frequency would store time data, to precisely position the laser on the disc. It has two rewritable areas: one for user data, and the other for encrypted data, the latter of which would hold the decryption keys necessary to unlock the extra content. They also have a Burst cutting area to uniquely identify each disc. Dataplays can transfer data at 1 megabyte per second.

Lancaster County has the most covered bridges in Pennsylvania with 28 covered bridges. Parke County, Indiana has the most covered bridges of any county in the United States with 31 covered bridges All of the covered bridges in Lancaster County, except for the Hunsecker's Mill Covered Bridge, Kurtz's Mill Covered Bridge, and the Willow Hill Covered Bridge, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most have been on the list since 1980. The WGCB numbering prefix for the county is 38-36 The bridges are an important tourist attraction, both economically and culturally. This is due to both their historical significance and, being in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, the frequent, iconic Amish horse and buggies bridge crossings. They are often visited in the form of covered bridge driving tours.  History  In the early to late 1800s there were approximately 1,500 covered bridges in the state of Pennsylvania. That number has decreased to just over 200 bridges, with more located in Lancaster County than any other county in the state. The remaining covered bridges in the county are a remnant of a time where most bridges in the United States were made from wood, since wood was relatively inexpensive and easy to acquire. Bridge making, however, was anything but easy and required significant cost, effort, and time. The cost of the building the bridges was covered by government funds or by private individuals building bridges across their land. Since the bridges were built from wood, they were covered to provide protection from the weather, dramatically extending the life of the bridges. Nevertheless, as floods and fires destroyed more bridges, they were eventually replaced or bypassed with more durable and longer-lasting reinforced concrete and steel beam bridges. Most of the existing bridges are owned by the county government which is responsible for periodic upkeep and maintenance. = Modern status = Throughout the years, many of the existing covered bridges have been destroyed, but were later reconstructed. For example, in 1972 a number of the county's covered bridges were either destroyed or badly damaged as a result of flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes. Notably, the Zook's Mill Covered Bridge managed to survive despite being filled with a few feet of water. The Willow Hill Covered Bridge, a relatively new bridge built in 1962, is a reconstructed bridge using materials recovered from the old Miller's Farm and Good's Fording covered bridges.  Design  The covered bridges in Lancaster County are all built of similar construction and appearance. Some of this is because many of the existing bridges were built by the same man, Elias McMellen, who built 12 of the existing bridges. The most common construction method used was that of the Burr arch truss. It is found in its single and double span forms in almost all of the covered bridges in the county, except for the Landis Mill Covered Bridge, a multiple kingpost design. The Pine Grove Covered Bridge and Herr's Mill Covered Bridge are the county's only double span covered bridges. While most of the bridges are situated in remote locations where there is limited traffic, a number of the bridges, such as Jackson's Sawmill Covered Bridge, were later reinforced with steel beams underneath the bridge floor and steel hanger rods on the sides to support heavier traffic or give the bridge additional support. Historically, the Lancaster County covered bridges were painted with red sides and all-white portals. Today most of the bridges retain this pattern, however, some of the portals are painted red with white trim (such as on the Zook's Mill Covered Bridge) or all-red (such as on the Pool Forge Covered Bridge). A number of these bridges also have the side panels painted red on the inside of the bridge while leaving the trusses unpainted. The Keller's Mill Covered Bridge is painted all-white, the only one of its kind in the county. Three of the bridges, Buck Hill Covered Bridge, Schenck's Mill Covered Bridge, and Shearer's Covered Bridge, have horizontal side boards. The rest of the bridges have vertical side boards.

A fortune teller (also called a cootie catcher,.. chatterbox,. salt cellar,. whirlybird, or paku-paku) is a form of origami used in children's games. Parts of the fortune teller are labelled with colors or numbers that serve as options for a player to choose from, and on the inside are eight flaps, each concealing a message. The person operating the fortune teller manipulates the device based on the choices made by the player, and finally one of the hidden messages is revealed. These messages may purport to answer questions (hence the name) or they may be activities that the player must perform. The same shape may also be used as pincers or as a salt cellar. Construction A paper fortune teller may be constructed by the steps shown in the illustration below:. # The corners of a sheet of paper are folded up to meet the opposite sides and (if the paper is not already square) the top is cut off, making a square sheet with diagonal creases. # The four corners of the square are folded into the center, forming a shape known in origami terminology as a blintz base or cushion fold. The resulting smaller square is turned over, and the four corners are folded in a second time. # All four corners are folded up so that the points meet in the middle, and the player works their fingers into the pockets of paper in each of the four corners. center Telling fortunes To use the fortune teller, the player telling the fortunes holds the four corners of the paper with index fingers and thumbs on both hands, keeping two pairs of corners together and the other two pairs separated so that only half of the internal sides of the corners are visible. Manipulations are done by various similar methods, for example: The player asks a question of the person holding the fortune teller; this question will be answered by the device. The holder then asks for a number or color. Once the number or color is chosen, the holder uses their fingers to switch between the two groups of colors and numbers inside the fortune teller. The holder switches these positions a number of times: which may be determined by the number of letters in the color selected, the number originally chosen, or the sum of both. Once the holder has finished switching the positions of the fortune teller, the player chooses one of the flaps revealed. These flaps often have colors or numbers on them. The holder then lifts the flap and reveals the fortune underneath. Steps may be repeated to suit the users. Other uses As well as being used to tell fortunes, these shapes may be used as a pincer to play-act catching insects such as lice, hence the \\"cootie catcher\\" name.. The \\"salt cellar\\" name refers to a different use for the same shape, in which it stands on a table with the four points downwards; the four open pockets may be used to hold small pieces of food.. In 2018, over 10,000 copies of this shape were used to create an installation resembling lava pouring from a building window, titled \\"ORIGAMI LAVA\\" (David Oliva + Anna Junc√†), for the Llu√®rnia festival in Olot, Spain. History This shape was introduced to the English-speaking world under the name salt cellar in the 1928 origami book Fun with Paper Folding by Murray and Rigney (Fleming H. Revell company, 1928, p. 10). The use of paper fortune tellers in England has been recorded since the 1950s.. Although the phrase \\"cootie catcher\\" has been used with other meanings in the U.S. for much longer,. the use of paper cootie catchers in the U.S. dates back at least to the 1960s...

The 'facts' are normally absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris's toughness, attitude, sophistication, and masculinity. Chuck Norris facts have spread around the world, leading not only to translated versions, but also spawning localized versions mentioning country-specific advertisements and other Internet phenomena. Allusions are also sometimes made to his use of roundhouse kicks to perform seemingly any task, his large amount of body hair with specific regard to his beard, and his role in the action television series Walker, Texas Ranger. Background Chuck Norris facts originally started appearing on the Internet in early 2005. Initially distributed in the Something Awful forums, the \\"facts\\" centered on Vin Diesel, in response to his film The Pacifier. After a few months, forum members chose Chuck Norris to be the new subject. Conan O'Brien's Chuck Norris jokes on Late Night with Conan O'Brien (which generally center on Walker, Texas Ranger) have been seen as an inspiration for the fad. The exaggerated style of these claims is similar to a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch called \\"Bill Brasky\\". Due to the popularity of this phenomenon, similar jokes have been created for various other celebrities, as well as fictional characters. Norris' response Norris responded to the Chuck Norris facts on his official website with a statement. Admitting some of the statements were indeed humorous, he said he tries not to take any of them seriously, and he hopes that such statements will interest people in real facts about him contained in his literary works. On October 23, 2006, Chuck Norris' first column for WorldNetDaily consisted of another response. It began similarly to the above statement from chucknorris.com, but then disclaimed his own prowess in favor of those of God and Jesus Christ. On November 29, 2007, Gotham Books, the adult division of Penguin USA, released a book entitled The Truth About Chuck Norris: 400 facts about the World's Greatest Human. Norris subsequently filed suit in December against Penguin USA claiming \\"trademark infringement, unjust enrichment and privacy rights\\". Norris dropped the lawsuit in 2008. On October 7, 2009, Tyndale House Publishers issued The Official Chuck Norris Fact Book, which was co-written and officially endorsed by Norris.The Official Chuck Norris Fact Book. Tyndale House Publishers. Norris has stated that his personal favorite \\"fact\\" is that people wanted to add Chuck Norris to Mount Rushmore, but the granite was not tough enough for his beard. Prominent mentions In the March 20, 2006 issue, Time magazine interviewed Chuck Norris, calling him an \\"online cult hero\\". In the answer to their last question, he called the Chuck Norris Facts \\"weird but wildly popular sayings\\" and quoted one: \\"Chuck Norris can divide by zero.\\" In 2011, a commercial for World of Warcraft featured Chuck Norris and included its own \\"Chuck Norris facts\\" in the dialogue. In the 2012 movie The Expendables 2, there is a wink at Chuck Norris facts when one is attributed to Chuck Norris' character Booker. In one scene Booker saves Barney Ross's (Sylvester Stallone) team in a firefight. After introductions all around, Ross says to Booker, \\"I heard another rumor. That you were bitten by a king cobra.\\" \\"Yeah, I was.\\", Booker replies, adding, \\"But after five days of agonizing pain, the cobra died.\\" Inspirations and similar trends In India, there exist similar jokes in the form of factoids and quotes about Indian film actor Rajinikanth. The factoids about Rajinikanth are inspired by Chuck Norris facts in that those follow the same pattern as Chuck Norris facts. While some Rajinikanth jokes are original, many of them are circulated with Norris' name replaced by Rajinikanth's. The beginning of 2013 saw similar cluster of jokes gaining trend in the country on Indian cricketer Ravindra Jadeja after Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni tweeted a few \\"facts\\" about him on his Twitter page. During the 2012 Armenian parliamentary election, some ballots with Chuck Norris's name written on them as a candidate were found. In Egypt, and prior to the Egyptian presidential election, 2012, similar jokes were made upon Omar Suleiman, the ex-director of the General Intelligence Directorate in the same style of Chuck Norris facts, making fun of the powers and skills that his supporters claimed to be his to promote him before the elections. In the episode \\"The Weird World of Wyrm\\" of the 2012 CGI series version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a holographic Chris Bradford ‚Äì a parody of Norris ‚Äì delivers a Norris Facts-esque quotation: \\"Chris Bradford fact #48: Chris Bradford always carries around four weapons of mass destruction: His arms and his legs.\\" Buffalo Bills fans began promoting similar tall tales about former linebacker Kiko Alonso during the 2013 season, after Alonso joined the team as a rookie. The tall tales were collectively known as \\"The Legend of Kiko Alonso\\".Kiko Alonso quickly wreaking havoc, becoming 'legend' as rookie with Buffalo Bills. Associated Press (October 2, 2013). Retrieved October 3, 2013. Makmende, a Kenyan male fictional hero, has been likewise purported to perform locally related feats and more, including in sheng. In 2006 a naming poll was held to decide the name of a new bridge in Hungary. Since nominations were accepted from everyone, Chuck Norris soon became the top candidate (beating several historical figures along with candidates like David Hasselhoff and Eric Cartman), before being taken over by Stephen Colbert after he called his fans to vote. The bridge was eventually named Megyeri Bridge. WWE wrestler Brian Myers, known as Curt Hawkins, incorporated the Chuck Norris facts into his gimmick in August 2016, where he uses his name instead of Norris, e.g., \\"Children have to put sunscreen on at the beach to protect themselves from Curt Hawkins\\".  Video games based on trend  In 2008, Gameloft produced Chuck Norris: Bring On the Pain, a video game for mobile devices, based on the online Norris cult elicited by Chuck Norris facts. The player takes control of Chuck Norris himself in a side-scrolling beat 'em up. The game was well- reviewed.

It was one of a number of 'free schools' created by James I (otherwise known as James VI of Scotland) in 1608 to provide an education to the sons of local merchants and farmers during the plantation of Ulster. Originally set up in Mountjoy near Lough Neagh in 1614, it moved to its present location in 1636. It was founded as a boys school but became coed in 1986 when the school amalgamated with the Dungannon High School for Girls. It has four 'sister' schools, The Royal School, Armagh in Armagh, County Armagh, The Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, The Royal School Cavan in County Cavan, and the Royal and Prior School in Raphoe, County Donegal. The original intention had been to have a \\"Royal School\\" in each of Ireland's counties (James I Order in Council read, \\"that there shall be one Free School at least appointed in every County, for the education of youth in learning and religion.\\" ) but only five were actually established, the schools planned for other counties never coming into being. History The Royal School, Dungannon is one of several Royal Schools ordered in 1608 by James I with the intended purpose \\"that there shall be one Free School at least appointed in every County, for the education of youth in learning and religion.\\" These schools provided an English style education to the sons of landed settlers in Ireland, most of whom were of Scottish or English descent. A Royal Charter of 13 May 1614 records the appointment of John Bullingbroke as the first Headmaster. Three more headmasters were appointed by royal charters before the Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland) took over the selection of Headmasters from the Crown in 1682. A later Archbishop lost interest in the school and the management was taken over by the Presbyterian Congregation in Dungannon. This was quite a turn round as in earlier years Presbyterians were not allowed to attend except on condition that they converted to Anglicanism. In the literature of the Nineteenth century the Royal School Dungannon is sometimes referred to as \\"Dungannon College\\" and in the writing of the Eighteenth century it is referred to as \\"the Dungannon school\\". Royal School, Dungannon Mr Paul Hewitt was the twentieth Headmaster and oversaw the major change to co-education in 1986, the huge expansion and rebuilding of the campus, the development of close links with Dilworth School,New Zealand, in a vibrant exchange scheme for GAP pupils and the growth of the school to over 650 pupils including a boarding department of 46 pupils and 6 full-time staff. Mr Hewitt was Chairman of the 1608 Royal Schools of Ulster when they celebrated their quatercentenary of the original charter in 2008 and were visited by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and the President of the Republic of Ireland, Mrs Mary McAleese. He was the fifth longest serving Headmaster of RSD when he retired after 25 years' service in 2009 and was succeeded by Dr David Burnett, previously Deputy Head of a boys' grammar school in Essex. The school has consistently figured in the top 10 grammar schools in Northern Ireland and the top 150 schools in the UK at Advanced Level. RSD is one of 66 selective Grammar Schools in Northern Ireland and has championed the system in the face of persistent attempts by Labour Party direct rule ministers and Sinn F√©in ministers of education to end academic selection in favour of a neighbourhood-based Comprehensive school system. On 11 March 2015 His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester visited the school to join in its 400-year celebrations. The Duke unveiled a plaque, and signed the visitor book along with raising a new school flag. Royal School for Girls The Royal School for Girls was founded in 1889 and was housed in the Robinson (North) wing of the Royal School between 1892 and 1926. This school became Dungannon High School for Girls in a self-contained campus adjoining Royal School lands on Ranfurly Road. In 1986 the High School was re-merged with the Royal School. The last Headmistress of the High School was Miss Margaret E Macbeth who became a Vice Principal in the amalgamated school. Miss Macbeth retired in 1994. The Royal and High School sites were joined with a covered walkway at the time of amalgamation and the High School building remained in use until 2003. Following the building of new classrooms that were sited closer to the original boys' school, the majority of the High School was demolished and redeveloped as sporting facilities. Dilworth Scholarship James Dilworth, a former pupil of the Royal School, left money in his will to found Dilworth School, Auckland, New Zealand in 1906. Since the 1990s links between the two schools have been cemented, with annual exchanges of students. Four Upper-Sixth formers from the Royal School, two boys and two girls, currently spend a gap year as staff members of Dilworth School before starting University. In return, three boys leaving Dilworth join RSD staff as GAP Tutors. On 7 October 2014 the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque in his memory on the main building, the \\"Old Grey Mother\\"; the joint unveilers were the Headmasters of the Royal School and the Dilworth School. 30 pupils from Dilworth attended. Motto and colours The school's motto is 'Perseverando', meaning 'By Persevering' and being interpreted today as 'Never Say Die'. The school's strapline, 'Excellence Through Perseverance', reflects the original intention of the motto, which was introduced in 1986, being adopted from the Girls' High School Latin motto. The school colours (chocolate and magenta) are shared by two other well known UK schools: Fettes College in Edinburgh and the rugby colours of Bradford Grammar School. Sports Having outstanding sporting facilities, including three rugby pitches, two hockey pitches (one a new-generation, floodlit astroturf pitch) indoor and outdoor cricket facilities, a sports hall with treadmills and other high-tech equipment for personal and team training, the school sports are rugby and hockey in winter and athletics, and cricket are played competitively along with shooting. Tennis, swimming, table-tennis, golf, horse riding, cross- county, and netball are also available throughout the year. Many of the facilities are shared by the wider community such as Primary Schools, Youth organisations, Soccer, Hockey and Gaelic clubs. The Old Grey Mother 'The Old Grey Mother' is an affectionate name for the school, referring to the older part of the current building, which is both very old (1789) and very grey, as the original beautiful sandstone was first cement rendered to prevent water ingress which then became stained over the 19th Century by the local industrial chimneys' smoke emissions. The Former Pupils' Association occasionally use this name in correspondence to members. The term \\"Old Grey Mother\\" was first used when the original sandstone front of the Headmaster's House was covered with a cement rendering which discoloured badly (due to industrial chimney discharges) until cleaned in the 1980s. Houses A house system exists to facilitate healthy sporting and academic competition. All students are assigned a house upon enrolling - where possible this is the same house as assigned to a previous relative at the school. The current houses are named below. The names in brackets indicate the full name of each house given when the amalgamation with Dungannon High School for Girls in 1986 incorporated the High School's own house system. 1986 names follow the original, historic Royal School names. * Mountjoy (now, Mountjoy-Ranfurly); * Bullingbrook (now, Bullingbrook-Tyrone); * Beresford (now, Beresford- Charlemount); * Nicholson (now, Nicholson-Dungannon).

In addition to acting, Raymond was also a composer, screenwriter, director, producer, and decorated military pilot. Early life Raymond was born August 13, 1908 in New York City. He attended the Professional Children's School while appearing in productions like Rip Van Winkle and Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. His Broadway debut, at age 17, was in The Cradle Snatchers which ran two years. (The cast included Mary Boland, Edna May Oliver, and a young Humphrey Bogart.) Film career His screen debut was in Personal Maid (1931). Another early appearance was in the multi-director If I Had a Million with W. C. Fields and Charles Laughton. With his blond good looks, classic profile, and youthful exuberance ‚Äî plus a name change to the more pronounceable \\"Gene Raymond\\" ‚Äî he scored in films like the classic Zoo in Budapest with Loretta Young, and a series of light RKO musicals, mostly with Ann Sothern. He wrote a number of songs, including the popular \\"Will You?\\" which he sang to Sothern in Smartest Girl in Town (1936). His wife, Jeanette MacDonald, sang several of his more classical pieces in her concerts and recorded one entitled \\"Let Me Always Sing\\". Studio portrait of Raymond, c. mid-1930s His most notable films, mostly as a second lead actor, include Red Dust (1932) with Jean Harlow and Clark Gable, Zoo in Budapest (1933) with Loretta Young, Ex-Lady (1933) with Bette Davis, Flying Down to Rio (1933) with Dolores del R√≠o, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, I Am Suzanne (1934) with Lilian Harvey, Sadie McKee (1934) with Joan Crawford, Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. and Mrs. Smith (1941) with Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery, and The Locket (1946) with Laraine Day, Brian Aherne, and Robert Mitchum. MacDonald and Raymond made one film together, Smilin' Through, which came out as the U.S. was on the verge of entering World War II. After service in the United States Army Air Forces Raymond returned to Hollywood. He wrote, directed and starred in the 1949 film Million Dollar Weekend. In later years he appeared in only a few films. His last major film was The Best Man in 1964 with Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson. In the 1950s he mostly worked in television, appearing in Playhouse of Stars, Fireside Theatre, Hollywood Summer Theater and TV Reader's Digest. In the 1970s he appeared on ABC Television Network's Paris 7000 and had guest roles in The Outer Limits, Robert Montgomery Presents, Playhouse 90, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Ironside, The Defenders, Mannix, The Name of the Game, Lux Video Theatre, Kraft Television Theatre and U.S. Steel Hour. Military service Following the beginning of World War II in Europe in 1939, Raymond felt certain the U.S. would eventually enter the war. He trained as a pilot for that eventuality, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Army Air Forces. He served as an observer aboard B-17 anti-submarine flights along the Atlantic coast before attending intelligence school and shipping out to England in July 1942. He served with the 97th Bomb Group before taking over as assistant operations officer in the VIII Bomber Command. He was transferred back to the U.S. in 1943 and piloted a variety of aircraft, both bombers and fighters, in stateside duties. He remained in the United States Air Force Reserve following the war, retiring in 1968 as a colonel,National Museum of the U.S. Air Force website, awarded with a Legion of Merit for his efforts during the Vietnam War. Personal life Raymond was notorious in Hollywood for being outspoken against the studio system, saying that it was not \\"living up to expectations\\". The only actors that he had faith in were Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, two people that he claimed \\"knew what they were doing\\". He was one of the first actors of the time to go freelance, although he admitted that it was mostly to spite the studios. He also excelled at sports, such as gymnastics and tennis. George Sidney once called Raymond \\"the most gorgeous thing the world had ever seen\\". Raymond with wife Jeanette MacDonald in the late 1950s. Raymond married Jeanette MacDonald in 1937. He met her at a Hollywood party two years earlier at Roszika Dolly's home; MacDonald agreed to a date, as long as it was at her family's dinner table. Despite the strong relationship, Raymond's mother did not like MacDonald, attempting to snub her a few times (such as arranging her son with Janet Gaynor as a plus one at a charity ball), and did not attend the wedding. The Raymonds lived in a 21-room Tudor Revival mansion named Twin Gables with their pet dogs, birds and their horse White Lady, which Raymond gave to MacDonald as a birthday present; after MacDonald's death, it was briefly owned by John Phillips and Michelle Phillips from The Mamas and Papas. MacDonald often worried about her husband's self-esteem. Although she appreciated his support, MacDonald wished that their success was equal; when Raymond turned down her offer to join one of her music tours, she did not feel let down: \\"Trailing along on my tours would make him 'Mr. MacDonald', a galling label for any self-respecting man. As it was, he was called 'Mr. MacDonald' often enough to make me admire tremendously his good sportsmanship in taking it on the chin. Raymond was sometimes mistaken for Nelson Eddy by MacDonald's fans and passersby, which MacDonald later admitted that she never liked either: \\"Of course we always laughed it off‚Äîsometimes Gene even obliged by signing Nelson's name‚Äîbut no one will ever know the agonies I suffered on such occasions. More than anything else in the world those days, I wanted to see him receive as much acclaim as I, to spare him these humiliations.\\" When she reunited with Maurice Chevalier in 1957, he asked her why she had retired from films, to which she replied, \\"Because for exactly twenty years I've played my best role, by his [Raymond] side. And I'm perfectly happy.\\" The two of them were married for almost 28 years until MacDonald's death in 1965. Despite rumors of getting close with Jane Wyman, in 1974, Raymond married Nelson Bentley Hees and they lived together in Pacific Palisades. Hees died from Alzheimer's in 1995. Raymond devoted time to Jeanette MacDonald's International Fan Club, befriending president Clara Rhoades, and taking a few members out to lunch annually. His last public appearance was June 27, 1997, at the 60th-anniversary banquet of the Fan Club at Beverly Wilshire Hotel. He was a Republican and supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election. During the time of the Hollywood Blacklist, he and MacDonald did not involve themselves with the HUAC investigations; neither were ever summoned to a hearing (MacDonald openly disagreed with the situation in a radio interview). Death The crypt Raymond shares with his first wife Jeanette MacDonald. On May 3, 1998, at 89 years of age, Raymond died of pneumonia at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.Gene Raymond Biography (1908-1998) at FilmReference.com His body was interred next to Jeanette MacDonald's in the Freedom Mausoleum at Forest Lawn, Glendale. For his contributions to the motion picture and television industries, Gene Raymond has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7001 Hollywood Boulevard (motion pictures) and 1708 Vine Street (television). Controversy =Sexuality and abuse allegations= Biographer Sharon Rich reported in her Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald biography, Sweethearts, that Raymond and MacDonald had a rocky marriage. This began on their honeymoon when MacDonald allegedly discovered Raymond in bed with Buddy Rogers. Sharon Rich was friends with MacDonald‚Äôs sister Blossom Rock and knew Raymond as well. Biographer E. J. Fleming alleged that Eddy had confronted Raymond for abusing MacDonald, who was visibly pregnant with Eddy‚Äôs child while filming Sweethearts which ended with Eddy attacking him and leaving him for dead, reported incorrectly by newspapers as Raymond recovering from falling down the stairs. Raymond was physically unable to father children and MacDonald alluded to this fact in her unfinished autobiography, writing that she returned from her Hawaii honeymoon with Raymond with the knowledge and accurate admittance that \\"The MacRaymonds had no children.\\" Nevertheless MacDonald had additional later documented pregnancies while married to Raymond, all of which ended in miscarriage. MacDonald's 1963 desk diary was sold at auction in 2015. Despite public statements over the years by both MacDonald and Raymond defending their marriage, the handwritten pages reveal that MacDonald and Raymond lived in separate bedrooms or apartments and that MacDonald‚Äôs health rapidly failed, with her weight noted daily and at times under 100 pounds. She writes of verbal abuse from Raymond, physical neglect, and being left alone for 44 days during the year until the diary ends on November 1, 1963, the date she flew to Houston Methodist Hospital for heart surgery.

Suh was born in Arkansas, the youngest of six children. After her mother and father died in 1910 and 1914, she relocated to Oklahoma to join a sister's family while she completed high school. She spent her early adult years as an office clerk and Sunday school teacher. Subsequently, she studied at the Southeastern State Teachers College, in Durant, and the Scarritt College for Christian Workers in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating in 1930 with a B.A. in ministry. She spent the next eight years working as a member of the American Southern Methodist Episcopal Mission in Korea. As Japanese colonial authorities continued to restrict the activities of foreign missions, Suh joined the staff of Shanghai American School (SAS) in 1938. There she met and married fellow staff member S≈è Kyu Ch‚Äô≈èl, thus losing her United States citizenship.NARA, Prolog Magazine, Summer 1998 Late in World War II she was interned by the Japanese for two years with other White Europeans at a camp in suburban Shanghai. After release, she resumed work at SAS for a year, before returning to Korea with her husband in 1946. The Suhs settled in Seoul, where Suh taught at the U.S. Legation school until being fired in 1949 due to suspicion of her husband for left wing political activities. They remained or were trapped in Seoul during the Northern army's invasion of South Korea in June 1950. Suh began announcing a short English language program for North Korean \\"Radio Seoul\\" starting on or about July 18, continuing until shortly after the Inchon landing on September 15, when the Suhs were evacuated north as a part of the general withdrawal of North Korean forces. Subsequently, she continued broadcasts on Radio Pyongyang. The Suhs participated in the political indoctrination of US POWs at a camp near Pyongyang in February 1951. Charles Robert Jenkins reported that, some time after the war, Suh was put in charge of English language publications for the Korean Central News Agency. He also wrote that he saw her in a photo for a 1962 propaganda pamphlet, and met her briefly in 1965 at a department store in Pyongyang. Jenkins stated that he was told in 1972 that Suh had been shot as a South Korean double agent in 1969. Early life Scarritt College Suh was born Anna Wallis to Albert B. and M.

There she met S≈è Kyu Ch‚Äô≈èl (ÏÑúÍ∑úÏ≤† ÂæêÂ•éÂì≤, also spelled Suh Kyoon Chul), who was hired to teach Korean and assist in school administration. She was dropped from the rolls of the missionary service and lost her United States citizenship after they married. She developed an interest in Korean politics, eventually taking up her husband's leftist views.Portland Free Herald, Oct 4, 1950EdwardsLech, Raymond B., page 118 The cosmopolitan Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession were likely a more accepting environment for the Suhs than homogeneous 1940s Korea would later prove to be, as suggested by the number of other Caucasian women on staff married to Asian men.MillsChoi In 1939, she visited San Francisco in an unsuccessful attempt to secure a US passport for her husband.Coshocton Tribute, August 30, 1950 Sino-Japanese War Americans in Shanghai began to depart that same year, slowly as tensions rose in the environs of the city, then en masse shortly before the US and Japan officially went to war. SAS remained open until February 1943,See Shanghai International Settlement when the remaining foreign staff were forced into the Chapei Civilian Relocation Center, a short distance away in the northern suburbs. This internment camp, one of several in and around Shanghai, occupied a three- story dormitory on the grounds of Great China University (now East China Normal University), most of which was damaged or destroyed during the 1937 Battle of Shanghai.Captives of Empire Whether as a part of the remaining school staff or on her own, Suh also entered the Chapei center at this time, while her husband may have remained free as a colonial subject of Japan. During the internment, the SAS staff and parents took advantage of the school's books that had followed them to organize classes for the children. Supplies with which to maintain the internees grew short towards the end of the war, and a number of women married to citizens of Axis powers or neutral countries were released in late 1944. It is possible that Suh was among these.Ibid In March 1943, a missionary family, R.W. and M.F. Howes, along with their two girls, were interned in Chapei‚Äîthe Japanese official name was Chapei Civil Assembly Center. Most of the people were Canadian or American, with some central European citizens. And later some British citizens were added from a camp further west up the Yangtze which the Japanese closed. Suh was released from Chapei camp along with other Americans and Canadians in September 1943 was not repatriated. The others left Shanghai in September 1943 on the Japanese ship Teia Maru, which traveled to Goa, India, and were exchanged for Japanese from America which had traveled on the Swedish ship The Griipsholm. In December 1943, she was staying at Shanghai General Hospital, originally a Catholic hospital, but during the war under Japanese control though still staffed by Catholic sisters. With Suh's formal release from detention at the end of World War II,National Archives, World II Prisoners of War Data File she joined the staff of the reconstituted SAS for the 1945-46 school year. Korean War Unable to continue earning a sufficient living in post-war Shanghai, she and her husband returned to liberated Korea, where she tutored children at the US Diplomatic Mission School in Seoul. Her employment was terminated after her husband was investigated for left wing activities.New York Times, Aug 28, 1950 Shortly thereafter, North Korea invaded the South in June 1950. The Korean People's Army occupied Seoul three days after the start of hostilities. The speed of the advance caught the majority of residents by surprise and unprepared to evacuate, in part due to ROK radio propaganda rather at odds with the actual situation.National Security Archive at George Washington UniversityEyewitness: Korean War Starts Suh and her husband remained as well, perhaps because he was unwilling to abandon a school for indigent boys that he administered. During a July 10 meeting in Seoul that included 48 to 60 members of the ROK National Assembly, the couple pledged their loyalty to the North Korean regime.Edwards, page 79Eyewitness: 1950: War of Unification Under Dr. Lee Soo, an English instructor from Seoul University, Suh began announcing for North Korean \\"Radio Seoul\\" from the Korean Broadcasting System's HLKA studios, with daily programs from 09:30 to 22:15 local time,Corpus Christi Times, September 12, 1950 first heard as early as July 18. The Suhs had been relocated to a temporary home near the station. Suh's defenders gave the dull tone of her broadcasts as proof that she was being forced to make them.Time Magazine, September 18, 1950 Her initial scripts suggested that American soldiers return to their corner ice cream stands, criticized the USAF bombing campaign, and reported names recovered from the dog tags of dead American soldiers to a background of soft music.Yuma Daily Sun, 10 August 1950Martin, page 76-77 The GIs gave her various nicknames, including \\"Rice Ball-\\" or \\"Rice Bowl Maggie\\", \\"Rice Ball Kate\\", and \\"Seoul City Sue\\".Senate Permanent Subcommittee: Executive SessionsSenate Permanent Subcommittee: Korean War Atrocities The latter name stuck, likely derived from \\"Sioux City Sue\\",Song: Sioux City Sue the title of a song initially made popular by Zeke MannersObituary, Zeke MannersSample: Sioux City SueNew York Times, 9 August 1950 from 1946.

The station came back on the air a week or two later.New York Times, Aug 14, 1950 The Suhs were evacuated north by truck after the Inchon landings, a few days before US forces entered the city.New York Times, Oct 04, 1950The Stars & Stripes, October 5, 1950Chillicothe Constitution Tribute, March 8, 1952 The Suhs joined the staff of Radio Pyongyang, where she continued English-language broadcasts to UN forces. They were temporarily reassigned to indoctrinate UN POWs at Camp 12 near Pyongyang in February 1951, after which the POWs were directed to continue indoctrinating each other, with Korean supervision.Lech, page 118-121 Later life Fellow defector Charles Robert Jenkins made several claims about Suh in his book The Reluctant Communist that have not been independently verified. He reported that, some time after the war, she was put in charge of English language publications for the Korean Central News Agency. He wrote that he saw her in a photo for a 1962 propaganda pamphlet called \\"I Am A Lucky Boy\\", dining with Larry Allen Abshier, a US Army deserter and defector. Jenkins reported meeting her briefly in 1965 at the \\"foreigners only\\" section of the No. 2 Department Store in Pyongyang. Jenkins also stated that he was told in 1972 that Suh had been shot as a South Korean double agent in 1969.Charles Robert Jenkins, page 115-116 Nationality Based on US law through the 1930s, citizenship for a married woman was almost exclusively based on that of her husband, particularly if they lived in his native land. Therefore, Suh probably lost her US citizenship when she married Suh Kyoon Chul in China. Suh Kyoon Chul, as well as all other native residents of Korea and Taiwan, were nationals of the Empire of Japan, which recognized itself as a multi-ethnic state.John Lie, Multiethnic JapanSchaeffer Suh may not have recognized her situation until the 1939 visit to San Francisco to secure a US passport for her husband. In addition to her status as a Japanese national, the US had almost completely frozen Asian immigration with the Immigration Act of 1924, which would likely have precluded his obtaining a passport. Arbitrary application of Japanese and US law may have dogged Suh over the following years. When the Japanese interned most ethnic Europeans within the Empire during World War II, it is not clear whether she was forced into the Chapei Relocation Center, or entered it willingly, since she was not a foreign national. Later, during the US military occupation of southern Korea, an attempt was made to restore her US citizenship, an effort which fell through for unknown reasons. It is possible that she became a national of South Korea as the wife of Mr. Suh. The Korean nationality that became reestablished between the end of World War II and the formal independence of the ROK in 1948 didn't distinguish between spouses.UNHCR: Japan - Koreans Although US forces sought her out after retaking Seoul in September, 1950, officials recognized that it was unlikely that Suh could be charged with treason by the US. In popular culture During the Korean War, USAF pilots improvised a spoof of the Zeke Manner's hit \\"Sioux City Sue\\" using the most popular nickname for Suh.Fighter Pilot Songs In several episodes of the TV series M*A*S*H a North Korean announcer calling herself \\"Seoul City Sue\\" is heard on the radio (rebroadcast over the camp's PA). In \\"Bombed\\" she tells the GIs that their wives and girlfriends are being unfaithful and they would have more prosperous careers as civilians. In \\"38 Across\\" she accuses Hawkeye Pierce of war crimes for performing an experimental technique to successfully save the life of a North Korean POW.David Scott Diffrient, pg 121 See also * Propaganda in North Korea * Pyongyang Sally References Notes Bibliography    * A list of United States Citizens on the S.S.

He was born at Bromley, Kent and died at Brampford Speke, Devon in a flying accident while serving in the Fleet Air Arm during World War II. Family and background Legge was the elder son of Henry B. Legge, a \\"paper agent\\", and his wife Edith. The couple are listed in the 1911 census as living at Sundridge Avenue, Bromley, Kent, with the family of five supplemented by five live-in servants. By the time of Geoffrey Legge's marriage on 19 September 1929 to Rosemary Frost, the family is recorded as living at Baston Manor, Hayes, Kent. Rosemary Frost was a fine tennis player, who beat Suzanne Lenglen at Queen's in one final. Early cricket and Oxford Legge was educated at Malvern, where he was captain of the cricket team in 1922. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's annual review of public school cricket praised his \\"beautiful off- side strokes\\" and added: \\"Legge was an excellent captain who knew how to get the best out of his bowlers, and had a sound control of his eleven in the field.\\" Going to Brasenose College, Oxford University, Legge played in one of the trial matches for the Oxford University cricket team in both 1923 and 1924 but did not score well and was not then picked for any of the university side's first-class matches in those seasons. In 1924 he was given a second chance by being selected for two first-class games by Kent, the second of which was against Oxford University, but he did not take the opportunity, failing to reach double figures in any of his four innings in these games. Once again in the 1925 trial matches for the Oxford side, Legge failed, and he was not selected for the first three first-class matches played by the University. He finally made his debut in the fourth game, against Worcestershire and hit 120, reaching his century in two hours; he followed that up with 40 in the second innings. He achieved little in the next two matches, but was still awarded his Blue with four weeks to go before the University Match after just three matches for the university. The selection was justified, as Legge topped the Oxford batting averages for the season and in the match against Cambridge scored 38 and 15 as an Oxford side packed with batsmen held out for a draw against an apparently superior Cambridge side. In 1926, Legge was the Oxford captain and was top of the averages again, but his season was disrupted first by the General Strike, which caused matches to be abandoned, and then by his involvement in a car accident in which he injured his hand: \\"A most unfortunate affair,\\" Wisden wrote. Legge had a taste for fast cars and was a member of the Oxford motor racing team, which was how the accident happened. He was recovered in time to lead his team in the University Match which was a low-scoring game won narrowly by Cambridge; Legge scored 14 and 16. County and Test cricket Legge played virtually the full season for Kent in 1927, making more than 900 runs at an average of more than 30 runs per innings, with two centuries, though in a very strong batting side he often batted as low as No 7. In the winter of 1927/28, MCC sent a cricket team to South Africa; the team, Wisden noted, was scarcely representative of top-class English cricket, since Jack Hobbs, Patsy Hendren, Maurice Tate, Harold Larwood and several prominent amateurs were either not selected or declined to go. Legge was one of half a dozen amateur players, and equalled his then-highest score when he made 120 against Orange Free State. That and other decent scores in first-class matches led to his selection for the first Test, but he failed to score in his only innings, being one of eight England batsmen who contributed only 13 runs between them to a match-winning score of 313. He lost his place for the next match in the series and did not regain it. Back in England for the 1928 season, Legge took on the captaincy of Kent and led the county to second place in the County Championship behind Lancashire, to a large extent because of a phenomenal bowling season for Tich Freeman, who took more than 300 first-class wickets in all matches, a record for a single season that is likely never to be broken. Legge himself played regularly but was less successful as a batsman than he had been in previous years, scoring 891 runs but at a reduced average of 21.73. The following season his aggregate advanced a little to 929 runs but because Kent played fewer matches his average improved to 25.10. For the first three months of the 1929 season, Kent were in contention for their first County Championship success since 1913, but of the last 10 matches only one was won, and they finished eighth. In July 1929 Legge was picked for the England tour of New Zealand in 1929-30. He and Rosemary Frost were married in September 1929, and they went on the tour together as their honeymoon.M. J. Turnbull & M. J. C. Allom, The Book of the Two Maurices, E. Allom & Co, London, 1930, pp 22‚Äì27. The tour of New Zealand was one of two tours organised that winter by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), following the 1926 Imperial Cricket Conference decision to extend Test cricket, and teams of mixed ability ‚Äì some established Test players, some amateurs and county professionals ‚Äì toured both West Indies and New Zealand that winter. The New Zealand team played first-class matches in Australia before arriving in New Zealand in December 1929. The team was scheduled to play three Test matches in New Zealand; in the event, the third match, at Eden Park, Auckland, was restricted by rain to a single day, so a fourth game, also at Auckland, was played. Legge played in all four Tests, making little impact in the first three; in the fourth game, however, he made 196, the highest score of the series and the highest of his own first-class cricket career. In minor matches on the tour, Legge had some success with his occasional leg-spin bowling: he took six Southland wickets for 24 runs in an innings in one two-day game and nine in the game against Manawatu. Despite his success in New Zealand and in his last Test innings, Legge was not picked for any representative matches back in England in 1930, and he had a poor season with the bat for Kent, failing to reach 50 in any innings and averaging just 14. At the end of the 1930 season he resigned from the captaincy of Kent for \\"business reasons\\", and he played only one further first-class game, a single match for Kent against the New Zealanders at the end of the 1931 season, when he batted at No 10 and was run out for 1. After cricket As a businessman, Legge acquired an airplane and flew many times on business to Europe; at the outbreak of war in 1939, he joined the Royal Navy's flying arm, the Fleet Air Arm, and was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander just six days before his death in a flying accident in Devon.

It is a companion film to 1967's I Am Curious (Yellow); the two were initially intended to be one 3¬Ω hour film.Vilgot Sj√∂man, I Was Curious: Diary of the Making of a Film (Grove Press, 1968). The films are named after the colours of the Swedish flag. Blue is a second version of Yellow, taking place before and after the first film. It has a more somber and bitterly satiric style, and a further explication of the framing narrative. Questions of lesbianism, religion and critiques of meritocracy are discussed. Lena Nyman won the award for Best Actress at the 5th Guldbagge Awards for her role in this film and I Am Curious (Yellow). Plot After the actress Lena had a sexual relationship with B√∂rje, whose affairs with other women caused her to hate him and question her commitment to Martin Luther King Jr.'s philosophy of nonviolence, she continues to explore her sexuality and politics. She befriends a woman named Sonja, and they travel to Str√∂ms Vattudal where they enjoy nude swimming and other excursions. While hiking, Lena also looks into a cabin and sees two women having lesbian sex. Lena returns to Stockholm, where she stays with the couple Hans and Bim. Bim notices Lena scratching herself, which Lena attributes to allergies. After Hans and Bim have an argument, Hans visits Lena in her bedroom. Bim enters with a magnifying glass and insists at looking at Lena's hand. She discovers Lena has scabies, disproving Lena's belief her constant itching owed to allergies and mosquito bites. Lena approaches B√∂rje in the car dealership where he now works, to inform him about the possibility that he also has scabies. He confirms he has been itching and accuses her of giving him the disease, citing her sexual promiscuity. She argues back he is just as promiscuous, resulting in a highly public heated argument. After he loses his job, they both head to the clinic for treatment.

The human bones were found in association with those of Pleistocene animals. The question of whether humans were present in Florida (or anywhere in the Americas) during the Pleistocene was controversial at the time, and most archaeologists did not accept that the Vero fossils were that old. Recent studies show that the Vero human bones are from the Pleistocene and are the largest collection of human remains from the Pleistocene found in North America. Initial discovery Mammoth or mastodon tusk with marks presumed to have been made by humans, found by E. H. Sellards at Vero man site in 1916 Starting in late 1913 vertebrate fossils were uncovered during the construction of a drainage canal from the Indian River between Vero and Gifford. Samples of the fossils were sent by Isaac M. Weills and Frank Ayers to the state geologist of Florida, E. H. Sellards, who recognized the finds as Pleistocene animals. In 1915, 26 fossilized human bones and fragments were found in the banks of the canal. The following year Sellards conducted his own excavations at the site, recovering an engraved mammoth tusk and a bird bone with marks possibly made by humans. In a nearby location he recovered human bones from the stratum that contained Pleistocene fossils. Sellards also found chert flakes and bone tools, including what appears to be a broken stemmed Archaic projectile point, and near the surface found a few ceramic sherds. Sellards first published his findings in 1916. He invited other scientists to visit the Vero site and investigate it themselves in October 1916 and in March 1917. Ale≈° Hrdliƒçka, T. Wayland Vaughan, Oliver Perry Hay, George Grant MacCurdy and Rollin T. Chamberlin visited and examined the site. Sellards and Hays concluded that the human bones dated from the Pleistocene. Hrdliƒçka, MacCurdy and Chamberlin argued that the human bones were much more recent, while Vaughan felt that more evidence was needed before making a decision. Hrdliƒçka, the most prominent physical anthropologist in America at the time, was firmly convinced that humans had not arrived in America until well after the Pleistocene had ended. Human bones, artifacts and/or human-modified animal bones in a Pleistocene context have been found elsewhere in Florida, including at the nearby Helen Blazes and Melbourne Bone Bed sites. Later developments The human bones excavated by Sellards were passed around various institutions for study. By the time carbon-14 dating of fossils became possible, about 35 years after the discovery of Vero man, some of the bones had been lost, and others had been rendered unusable for such testing due to the way they had been preserved with chemicals. In 2009 scientists announced the discovery of a carving of a mammoth or mastodon or, although not considered as likely, a giant sloth, on a piece of bone found north of Vero Beach (the general area in which Vero Man was found). The carving may be among the oldest art found in the Americas. Scientists studying the carving noted similarities with Pleistocene art in Europe. Art historian Barbara Olins Alpert has noted that similarity does not prove connection, as finely executed realistic art styles have appeared in various times and places. In 2014 new excavations at the site of the discovery of Vero man were undertaken by Mercyhurst University and the Old Vero Ice Age Sites Committee, a local non-profit organization. The Old Vero Ice Age Sites Committee announced the discovery of a possible \\"human living surface\\" at least 12,000 years old during the 2014 excavation season. Excavations continued in 2015 at the site, with recent finds including 14,000-year-old \\"charred\\" bones from a dire wolf and a horse, possibly from a hearth. The archaeologists from Mercyhurst University withdrew from excavations at the Old Vero Man site in Vero Beach after 2015.

Molinari began his artistic career focused on formalism, but soon discovered the works of Vasarely and was inspired by geometric forms and their rich optical effects. From 1951-1960, Molinari lived and painted in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1960, Molinari traveled to Paris, France, where he began work with the Group de Recherche d'Art Visuel. Molinari lived in Paris from 1960 to 1966. In 1963, Molinari exhibited his painting La Cuna de Mangle at the Paris Biennial at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1964, Molinari took a two-month trip to the United States to study the artworks in museums of major US cities. Intrigued by pop art in America, he saw its infinite possibilities. In 1966, Molinari moved back to Ecuador with the sole purpose of acquiring a visa to move to the United States. During his time back in Guayaquil, Ecuador, Molinari reconnected with old colleagues: Enrique T√°bara, An√≠bal Villac√≠s, Le√≥n Ricaurte, Gilberto Almeida, Oswaldo Moreno and Guillermo Mu√±oz and began working with their Group VAN (Vanguardia Artistica Nacional). Two years later, in 1968, Molinari obtained his visa and moved to New York City where he lived for seven years. While in New York, Molinari became fascinated with the optical geometric (Op Art) works of Vasarely. He soon developed his own style, inspired by that of his compatriot, T√°bara, that fused the tropical nature of his hometown into the informal constructivist geometry, toward the creation of a visual autonomy. In further development, Molinari began to focus on the geometrical optical effects and changing perspectives. He began intense studies of color theory, yet at times explored spontaneity of color and chromatic delusions. In 1977, Molinari was part of an exhibit at MoMA PS1 titled, 10 Downtown: 10 Years (September 11‚ÄìOctober 2, 1977). Like other VAN informalists, Luis Molinari sought to honor the history of his homeland with a tribute to Pre-Columbian architecture, as seen in his 1974 painting, Temple of the nuns-Uxmal.

The lake spans both Quebec and Vermont, but is mostly in Quebec. Most of the watershed that feeds the lake is located in Vermont, and is a source for accumulated phosphorus, sediments and other pollutants. Cleanup efforts since the late 1980s have improved the water quality. The lake furnishes potable (drinking) water for 200,000 people. Physical characteristics The lake is long with 73 percent of the lake's surface area in Quebec, where it drains into the Magog River. However, three-quarters of its watershed, , is in Vermont. The total is , with located in Quebec. In Vermont, the lake lies in parts of the towns of Derby and Newport, in addition to the City of Newport, all in Orleans County. In Quebec, the lake lies in parts of Austin, Magog, Ogden, Potton, Saint-Beno√Æt- du-Lac, and Stanstead Township, all in Memphr√©magog Regional County Municipality. The lake occupies most of what the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources calls \\"Basin 17\\". At the very south end of the lake, there is the South Bay, connected by the narrowest part of the lake. The lake elevation is approximately above mean sea level. Both ends of the lake are fairly shallow, with depth ranges of to . The lake bottom takes a dramatic drop in Canada, starting opposite Mont Owl's Head and continuing that way north to Gibraltar Point, where it starts to climb back to the shallows of the north end. Its maximum recorded depth of is located in Canada, opposite Jewett Point (at approximately ). The lake is the third deepest in Vermont.Behind Lake Champlain at deep and Lake Willoughby at deep It contains 21 islands. Province Island, the largest, is divided by the international border. The lake is irregular in shape, and along its shores are several striking indentations, in some places low, and in some other parts high and rocky. Along the western shore of the lake are several mountains, prominent among which are Owl's Head, Elephantis, and the Hog's Back. = Islands = 1901 map of Lake Memphremagog There are twenty-one islands on Lake Memphremagog. Of these, five are in the United States, one is international, and fifteen are in Canada. Many of the islands have had several names throughout history; the current names are provided.  Islands in the United States  * Horseneck Island (at approximately ) is the southernmost island on the lake and is near the eastern shore. * Bell Island (at approximately ) is one of the Twin Sister islands (the other being Black Island) and is south of Gull Rocks and Black Island. * Gull Rocks (at approximately ) is north of Bell Island and south of Black Island. * Black Island (at approximately ) is one of the Twin Sister islands (the other being Bell Island) and is north of Gull Rocks and Bell Island. * Cove Island (at approximately ) is east of Black Island.  International Islands  * Province Island (at approximately ) is crossed by the international boundary. About one tenth of the southern end of the island is in the United States; the remainder is in Canada.  Islands in Canada  * Tea Table Island (at approximately ) is north-northeast of Province Island, west of Reid Bay, and south of the Cedarville Wharf. * Round Island (at approximately ) is near the western shore of the lake. * Whetstone Island (at approximately ) is on the eastern shore at the entrance to Fitch Bay and is south of Gull Island. It is named for the novaculite oil stone that was mined there. * Gull Island (at approximately ) is north of Whetstone Island and at the entrance to Fitch Bay. * Loon Island (at approximately ) is in Fitch Bay. * Minnow Island (at approximately ) is east of Skinner's island. * Skinner's Island (at approximately ) is west of Minnow Island and south of Long Island. * Long Island (at approximately ) is north of Skinner's Island. * Molson's Island (at approximately ) is on the eastern shore. * Lord's Island (at approximately ). * Eagle Island (at approximately ) is north of Hermitage Point and west of Hermitage Bay. * Three Sisters (at approximately , , and ) are three small islands that are grouped together. * Charest Island (at approximately ) is the northernmost island on the lake and is in Magog, Quebec. = Hydrology = Four Vermont rivers directly empty into the lake: the Clyde, Barton, the Black and the Johns River. In the middle of the winter, the ice on the lake can become thick. The Magog River, in Quebec, drains the lake towards the northeast. The hydroelectric producing Memphemagog Dam, on the Magog River, regulates the water level of the lake. The water level of the lake is governed by a treaty signed in 1935 between the United States and Canada. = Geology = During the ice age, the lake was a proglacial lake which covered Lake Magog, Lake Brompton, and much of the Saint Fran√ßois watershed including East Angus, Sherbrooke, and Windsor. =Ecology= Like many other lakes, Memphremagog is accumulating phosphorus, sediments, and other pollutants, primarily runoff from farms, but from other sources as well. Exotic species infestations are a concern, with an existing Eurasian water milfoil population and the potential for a zebra mussel infestation. Since the 1970s, significant efforts have been made to reduce the polluting effects of direct discharges into the lake and its tributaries, and lake quality has improved. In 1994, the Lake Memphremagog Watershed Association was formed to focus on solving lake and river issues. Testing done in 2008 was unable to determine the cause of excessive nitrogen and phosphorus.The Chronicle, July 1, 2009, page 2A, \\"Search continues for sources of pollution,\\" Richard Creaser In 2010, a study revealed that farms contribute disproportionately to nutrient loads. Although farms have 16% of total land use in the drainage area, they produce 44% of the runoff. Baseline nutrients for a lake are 14 micrograms of phosphorus per litre of water. The lake was measured at 17 micrograms, 18% above the standard. Although the acreage devoted to farming has decreased, the retired land has most often been developed, itself a source of runoff.  Origin of name  The lake is within the larger territory originally inhabited by the Abenaki tribe. The lake's name, Memphremagog, is derived from the Algonkian language: *Memphremagog comes from the word Memrahabegek, which means \\"where there is a big expanse of water\\". *Memphremagog was also pronounced as \\"Mamphremagog\\". This came from the Abenakis' Mamlawbagak which signifies \\"a long and large sheet of water\\". The prefix mamlaw denotes largeness or abundance; the particule baga denotes water; and \\"k\\" marks the name as given in local term. The local pronunciation of the name in English is \\"mem fra MAY gog\\".  History  Saint-Beno√Æt-du-Lac Abbey is located in the village of Saint-Beno√Æt-du-Lac, Quebec. The village is on the western shore of Lake Memphremagog. In 1753, the Abenakis brought the ransomed John Stark down the lake and came ashore where Newport is now. Rogers' Rangers were forced to retreat south following their attack on Saint-Francis, Quebec in 1759. To confound their avenging pursuers, they split up on the east shore of the lake. The first accurate depiction of the map was in 1776. This marks the beginning of interest by settlers. The Mountain Maid paddlewheeler operated from 1850 to 1870. The Lady of the Lake steam excursion/ferry paddlewheeler started operating in 1867. It stopped operations in 1917. It was based in Newport. The Anthemis steamer was built in 1909 to carry 300 people. It stopped operating after 1945. In August 1942, a single-engined Royal Canadian Air Force training plane crashed into the lake near the west shore near Newport, killing the pilot, its only occupant. In 2010 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service accepted a bequest of undeveloped land on the shores the lake on Eagle Point along the border with Canada. = Memphre = Lake Memphremagog allegedly contains a cryptid named Memphre (or Memphr√©), which has received sightings since the 18th century and continues on in the folklore of the area. A sighting of Memphre was reported in 2000. Lighthouses Lake Memphremagog is known to have had at least three lighthouses on the Vermont side and seven on the Quebec side. These were used in aiding boaters in navigating the waters of the large lake. =Vermont lighthouses= All three of the original lighthouses have been demolished. Maxfield Point Light The small city of Magog, Quebec The Maxfield Point Light was a small lighthouse constructed on the Vermont side of Lake Memphremagog in 1879. A conical, cast iron structure, it was 25 feet (7.6 m) tall, with a focal plane 40 feet (12.2 m) above sea level. It showed a fixed white light, visible for 10 (16 km) miles. The lighthouse no longer exists; it is unknown what happened to it, or when it was deactivated. Newport Wharf Light The Newport Wharf Light was a tower that was built in the Newport section of Lake Memphremagog in 1879. The lighthouse was a steel skeleton tower, painted red, that was fixed on a concrete foundation. The tower showed a fixed red light that was visible for up to , with the height of the focal plane being 37 feet (11.2 m). As with the Maxfield Point Lighthouse, the date this lighthouse was demolished is unknown. Whipple Point Light Whipple Point Light was a tower that was built on the end of a pier on Whipple Point in Lake Memphremagog. Built in 1879, the tower was constructed of wood in a hexagonal shape and stood 13 feet (4 m). The light was fixed white and was visible from up to away, with a focal plane of 25 feet (7.6 m). The lighthouse was deactivated around 1906 and was demolished at an unknown date. =Quebec lighthouses= Most of the Quebec lighthouses were originally established in 1878. None of the original lighthouses have survived, although some of them have been replaced by simple navigation lights. From north to south, the lighthouses were: Magog Lighthouse Magog Lighthouse was located on a freight shed and had a fixed red light with a range of . It was built in 1910 and located near Magog. It was demolished on an unknown date. Witch Shoal Lighthouse Witch Shoal Lighthouse was located about southwest of Magog. The original lighthouse was built in 1878 as a white square wooden tower on a pier. It had a fixed white dioptric light located at a height of above the high water mark and with a range of .Sixteenth Annual Report of the Department of Marine and Fisheries Being for the Fiscal Year Ended 30th June, 1882 It was rebuilt in 1900. In April 1933, it was destroyed by pressure from the ice caused by the rising level of the lake. It was rebuilt in 1960 as a small metal tower, which was swept away by spring ice in 1978. Since 1980, the mast that replaced it is left in place only from May to October each year. The tower is high with a fixed white light that has a range of and a focal plane of . The aid is owned by the Coast Guard and maintained by a private contractor. Black Point Lighthouse Black Point Lighthouse was located on the western side of the lake, about southwest from Witch Shoal lighthouse. It was also known as the Green Point Lighthouse. It was built in 1878 as a white square wooden tower. It had a fixed white catoptric light located at a height of above the high water mark and with a range of . It had a focal plane of . It was rebuilt in 1914 and demolished on an unknown date. Wadleigh's Point Lighthouse Wadleigh's Point Lighthouse was located on the western side of the lake, about southwest of Black Point lighthouse. It was also known as the Bryant Landing Light and was near Austin. The original lighthouse was built in 1878 as a 22-foot white square wooden tower with a fixed white catoptric light located at a height of above the high water mark and with a range of . In approximately 1914, that was replaced by a square pyramidal skeletal tower with enclosed lantern. In 1939, that was replaced by a square skeletal tower with enclosed lantern. In 1980, that was replaced by a modern steel tower with a fixed white light that has a range of . The still-active light is installed from May to October each year. Chateau de Silva Lighthouse Chateau de Silva Lighthouse was located on the western side of the lake at the Revere House (formerly the Chateau de Silva) hotel wharf, approximately southwest of the Wadleigh's Point lighthouse. It was built in 1878 as a white square wooden tower with a fixed white catoptric light located at a height of above the high water mark and with a range of . The light had a focal plane of . It was demolished on an unknown date. Molson's Island Lighthouse Molson's Island Lighthouse was located on the southwest point of Molson's Island, approximately southeast of the Chateau de Silva lighthouse. This was on the eastern side of the lake, near Georgeville. It was built in 1878 as a white square wooden tower with a fixed white catoptric light located at a height of above the high water mark and with a range of . The light had a focal plane of . It was rebuilt in 1914 and demolished on an unknown date. The light was replaced with a lighted buoy. Lead Mines Lighthouse Lead Mines Lighthouse was located on the western side of the lake, approximately southwest of the Molson's Island lighthouse. This was near Leadville, at the foot of Mount Owl's Head. It was built in 1878 as a white square wooden tower with a fixed white catoptric light located at a height of 20 feet above the high water mark and with a range of . The light had a focal plane of . It was rebuilt in 1914 and demolished on an unknown date.  Economy  The watershed in Vermont is largely agricultural and forest land with residential development increasing in recent years in both Vermont and Quebec. The lake furnishes potable (drinking) water for 200,000 people. In 2011 a day cruise ship started summer operations on the Canadian side of the lake.Escapades Memphr√©magog :: Gourmet cruises on Lake Memphremagog, Magog, Qc. Escapadesmemphremagog.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. Sargent's Bay Yacht Club Sargent's Bay Yacht Club, despite its name, is a small children's dinghy sailing club based out of Sargent's Bay. It operates throughout eight weeks of the summer, hosting up to 40 campers a week, with a staff of five to seven. It was started in 1935 by several families in the bay, with the goal of teaching their children the basics of the sport they all cherished so much, sailing. Since 1935, the Fisher family has graciously allowed the operation of the club to continue on their property.  Popular culture  Lake Memphremagog is mentioned in a novel by Chris Bohjalian, Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands, in which the lake is the site of a nuclear reactor that has suffered a cataclysmic meltdown. Lake Memphremagog is mentioned in Northwest Passage, a historical novel by Kenneth Roberts about the 1759 Rogers' Rangers raid. In Northwest Passage, the 1940 film based on the novel, Spencer Tracy uses a map that shows Lake Memphremagog and the environs. The 1986 film The Decline of the American Empire was shot at Lake Memphremagog from September to October 1985.Andr√© Loiselle, Denys Arcand's Le D√©clin de L'empire Am√©ricain and Les Invasions Barbares, University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 23. The Canadian band The Tragically Hip mentions Lake Memphremagog in their 2002 unreleased song \\"Problem Bears\\", part of their In Violet Light album sessions. Lake Memphremagog was mentioned and depicted in Disappearances, a 2006 film by director Jay Craven starring Kris Kristofferson, and co-starring Charlie McDermott and Genevi√®ve Bujold. Fictional versions of the lake appear in Howard Frank Mosher's books about the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont, including God's Kingdom (St. Martin's Press, 2015). Lake Memphremagog was the setting for the climactic scene in Kenneth Butler's satiric novel Holy Fool (TouchPoint Press, 2015).

Written by Fellini, Tullio Pinelli, Ennio Flaiano and Michelangelo Antonioni, the film is about a man who brings his new bride to Rome for their honeymoon, to gain an audience with the Pope, and to present his wife to his family. When the young woman sneaks away to find the hero of her romance novels, the man is forced to spend hour after painful hour making excuses to his eager family who want to meet his missing bride. The White Sheik was filmed on location in Fregene, Rome, Spoleto and Vatican City. Plot Two young newlyweds from a provincial town, Wanda (Brunella Bovo) and Ivan Cavalli (Leopoldo Trieste), arrive in Rome for their honeymoon. Wanda is obsessed with the \\"White Sheik\\" (Alberto Sordi), the Rudolph Valentino-like hero of a soap opera photo strip and sneaks off to find him, leaving her conventional, petit bourgeois husband in hysterics as he tries to hide his wife's disappearance from his strait-laced relatives who are waiting to go with them to visit the Pope. The plotline was appropriated by Woody Allen in his film To Rome with Love. Cast * Alberto Sordi as Fernando Rivoli, The White Sheik * Leopoldo Trieste as Ivan Cavalli * Brunella Bovo as Wanda Giardino Cavalli * Giulietta Masina as Cabiria, the prostitute * Lilia Landi as Felga, the photonovel's gipsy * Ernesto Almirante as Dottore Fortuna, the photonovel's director * Fanny Marchi√≤ as Marilena Alba Vellardi * Gina Mascetti as Aida Rivoli, the wife of Fernando * Ugo Attanasio as Uncle of Ivan Production The White Sheik was Fellini's first solo effort as a director. He had previously co-directed Variety Lights in 1950 with Alberto Lattuada. Originally the treatment for The White Sheik was written by Michelangelo Antonioni. Carlo Ponti commissioned Fellini and Tullio Pinelli to develop the treatment. It was satirical in nature, targeting the trashy fotoromanzi comic strips that were extremely popular in Italy when the film was made. The male lead, Leopoldo Trieste, a playwright who did not consider himself an actor, reluctantly auditioned for Fellini. During the audition Fellini asked him to compose a sonnet that the lead character would have written to his wife. The poem which begins \\"She is graceful, sweet and teeny...\\" was included in the film. Appearing briefly as the prostitute Cabiria, Giulietta Masina would later return to this role in Nights of Cabiria. Her short scene inspired Fellini to write the screenplay and also convinced producers that Giulietta was ready for the leading role. Reception Italian film critic Giulio Cesare Castello, writing for Cinema V, argued that Fellini's past as a successful strip cartoonist made him a natural choice as the film's director: \\"Fellini was undoubtedly the best qualified and for two reasons: firstly, his experience as a strip cartoonist and consequently his familiarity with the secrets and intrigues of the world he was about to bring to the screen; secondly, his gift for sarcastic comment and delight in satirizing tradition... The result is unusual and stimulating but derives more from the failure to establish a basic mood or tone rather than from any direct intention. Fellini should find this tone in future works if he is to avoid the discontinuity we found here.\\"Castello's review first published in Cinema V (Milan) December 15, 1952.

He is best known as the co-creator of the baseball games Earl Weaver Baseball and Intellivision World Series Baseball. He is also recognized for designing the first dance notation computer software, DOM. Dombrower studied both dance and mathematics at Pomona College in Claremont, California. After his graduation he found it frustrating that the new microcomputer technology had not solved an age-old problem: how choreographers could record their work in written form. He created the DOM system on an Apple II computer in 1981, which allowed choreographers to use a simple system of codes to enter their work. The resulting dance movements were then performed by a figure on screen. In 1982 Intellivision game design director Don Daglow (also a Pomona College graduate) recruited Dombrower to join Mattel to work on a new kind of baseball game that for the first time would feature large on-screen animated figures and multiple camera angles. Prior video games all showed a static or scrolling playfield from a single camera angle, and Daglow believed that Dombrower's experience with DOM made him the perfect programmer and animator to create the game. Dombrower made progress quickly, and Intellivision World Series Baseball's radically new design created a major market event during the Christmas television advertising season in 1982. Although the title enjoyed limited distribution because of the Video game crash of 1983, it succeeded in its ambition to prove that video games could mimic television coverage of sports events, and soon all major sports games followed its stylistic lead. In 1986 Daglow, then working at Electronic Arts, sought out Dombrower once again. EA Founder Trip Hawkins had agreed to back the creation of another baseball game, Earl Weaver Baseball. As they had done at Intellvision, Daglow designed the baseball simulation and overall look, while Dombrower designed the game's visual presentation and its underlying technology. In contrast to some celebrity athletes who merely lent their names to projects, Hall of Fame manager Earl Weaver worked with the team to design the game's artificial intelligence. When the game appeared in 1987, it was called one of the 25 best games of all time by Computer Gaming World, and its success helped pave the way for the creation of the EA Sports brand and product line. Dombrower also led the development of the sequel, Earl Weaver Baseball II. Dombrower developed EWB Baseball for the iPhone, the spiritual successor to the Earl Weaver series, which was released March 23, 2009.

He played in three Tests for England against South Africa in 1927‚Äì28 but did modestly on the matting wickets. He would have toured Australia in 1928‚Äì29 but his health broke down before the tour began. However, as a stock bowler for Nottinghamshire, Staples was an essential part of their successful team in the 1920s because his long spells of accurate medium-pace bowling allowed speedster Harold Larwood and the physically sensitive Tich Richmond to be more effective through not being overworked. Although on a relatively few occasions his off-break from round the wicket could be quite unplayable, Staples rarely obtained exceptional averages even in helpful summers but there is no doubt that without his ability to keep more penetrative bowlers fresh Nottinghamshire's bowling would have been much less formidable.  Biography  Born on 18 September 1892, Newstead Colliery, Nottinghamshire, Staples first played for Nottinghamshire in 1920. Though he accomplished a few good performances such as 6 for 81 against the great Surrey batting side at The Oval, it was though he had little sting, and although he obtained a permanent place in 1921 and took 76 wickets, there was still little to suggest a significant career. Although in 1922, Staples bowled very well at times (notably four quick wickets to round off a brilliant win over Yorkshire) and made 85 not out in a last wicket stand of 140 with Richmond, he did not establish a reputation as a major force in the game until 1923, when his bowling gave Yorkshire its only defeat in the Championship and he took almost 100 wickets. In addition, he surprised everyone by making 110 against Surrey in the August Bank Holiday match. However, the appalling summer of 1924 brought a setback with Staples averaging 23 runs a wicket on very favourable pitches. In 1925, though his average was much higher than the other Nottinghamshire bowlers (Richmond, Larwood and Barratt) his workload was a vital factor in the team's success, and this trend continued throughout 1926, when Staples took 113 wickets. 1927, with Nottinghamshire missing the Championship due to a remarkable loss in their last game to previously winless Glamorgan, saw Staples have his best season with 132 wickets including 9 for 141 against Kent in a game where Carr put Kent into bat but the pitch proved easy. Because the matting wickets were suited to a medium-paced, but flat trajectory, off-spinner like Staples, he was chosen to visit South Africa but did only moderately. However, in 1928 Staples bowled so well that his persistence and accuracy were seen as great assets on the cast-iron Australian pitches, but illness prevented him touring and restricted his cricket somewhat in 1929, when he only just reached 100 wickets. Although he just failed to reach three-figures in the wet summer of 1930, Staples was still a force with the ball as shown when he took 7 for 24 on a sticky wicket against Leicestershire at Trent Bridge. However, in 1931 a car accident kept him out of most of Nottinghamshire's later programme and the team's bowling was very weak without him and Larwood. 1932 opened with a sensational 10 for 21 against Hampshire and saw Staples on the whole bowling better than ever, so that it was a surprise when after 1933 Staples decided to retire to coach the team.

He was born in 1927, in Aberystwyth, Wales. He studied engineering at the University of Cambridge, and went on to work for AEI in Manchester, England. His 1970 book Design Methods is considered a major text in design. Collaborating with engineers, Jones advocated ergonomics and the consideration of user-centred issues not part of engineering skills and attitudes at the time. When the results of his ergonomic studies of user behavior were not utilized by the firm's designers, Jones set about studying the design process being used. Jones was also frustrated with the superficiality of industrial design at the time and become involved with ergonomics. Design methods as an area was driven by: * Inability to balance individual, group, societal, and ecological needs; * Lack of purpose, order, and human scale; * Aesthetic and functional failure in adapting to local physical and social environments; * Development of materials and standardized components that were ill-suited for use in any specific application; * Creation of artifacts that people did not like Jones wasn't actually addressing design as presently conceived. He set out an entirely original philosophy of design--one that questioned the aims, goals and purposes of designing. He stated that one of the reasons why he focused on Design Methods was :\\". . . it's not another way of doing design, you see, it's a way of doing what designers don't do at all.\\" At the end of the 1950s he published an article \\"A Systematic Design Method\\" articulating ways to integrate ergonomic data into the engineering design process. His emerging ideas about Design Methods was to integrate both rationality and intuition‚Äîa common thread in the formalization of Design Methods and how it was interpreted by other groups. In 1962 he was one of the instigators of the influential conference on design methods, which led to the formation of the Design Research Society, of which Jones was Chair 1971-73. In 2004 he was presented with the Society's Lifetime Achievement Award. Jones also realized that designers needed to move out of focusing on expression and modes of production and begin to address the definition of a problem to be solved. He commented that :\\"the future job of a designer is to give substance to new ideas while taking away the physical and organizational foundations of old ones. In this situation, it is nonsense to think of designing as the satisfaction of existing requirements. New needs grow and old needs decay . . .\\" From 1970-74 Jones was the first Professor of Design at The Open University.

The first kanji of the name originally translated into \\"Êñ∞=New\\", but in the mainline branch the kanji for \\"new\\" was eventually changed into the homophonic \\"Á•û=sacred\\". The name of the school may also be transliterated as Shint≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´, but the koryu tradition should not be confused with the modern school of Shint≈çy≈çshin-ry≈´ which is unconnected. History / Mainline Branch The Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ tradition was founded late in the Edo period by a Kuroda clan retainer named Katsunosuke Matsuoka (1836-1898) Katsunosuke was born in Edo-Hantei, the Edo headquarters of the Kuroda clan in 1836. Katsunosuke opened his first d≈çj≈ç in 1858 in the Asakusa district of Edo where he taught Tenjin Shiny≈ç-ry≈´ j≈´jutsu. He also stood in for his teacher Sakakibara Kenkichi, fourteenth headmaster of the Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ry≈´ school of kenjutsu, during Sakakibara's service to the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemochi. Over the years Katsunosuke became convinced that the contemporary j≈´jutsu systems of the late Edo period had lost much of their military usefulness, evolving into systems driven more by individual challenge matches than effective military engagement. For this reason in 1864 he decided to combine his expertise in kenjutsu and j≈´jutsu by formulating a new system of his own creation called Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´, meaning \\"new willow school.\\" Katsunosuke intended this new system embrace a curriculum reflecting that of a s≈çg≈ç bujutsu or integrated martial system in order that it be militarily applicable. By 1868, Katsunosuke had witnessed the Meiji Restoration and fought on the losing side of the Boshin War. Following the collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate Katsunosuke relocated to Ueno Village, north of Edo, eventually constructing a new dojo there. Following Katsunosuke‚Äôs relocation to Ueno, the dojo in Asakusa became a branch dojo under the direction of licensed instructor, Inose Matakichi. Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ split into two lines in 1895 when an aging Katsunosuke authorized another licensed student living in Edo named Shigeta Ohbata to separate from the mainline and lead his own branch of Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´. This line became the Ohbata-ha Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´. Katsunosuke Matsuoka died in 1898 at the age of 62. Without a male heir, the Matsuoka family appointed Matakichi Inose as the temporary headmaster of Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´. With this appointment it was understood that the headmastership would return to the Matsuoka family when Katsunosuke's grandson, Tatsuo, reached adulthood. In 1917, following Tatsuo‚Äôs graduation from Tokyo Medical College, Matakichi Inose formally returned the headmastership of Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ to the Matsuoka family via Tatsuo. In addition to functioning as the 3rd headmaster of Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´, Tatsuo Matsuoka was a successful politician and an accomplished Judoka, eventually attaining the rank of 7th dan. He died in 1989 at the age of 95. Tatsuo Matsuoka did not appoint a 4th generation headmaster but following his death the remaining students of mainline Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ formed a new organization called the Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ Domonkai and appointed Dr. Ryozo Fujiwara to lead this organization. Dr. Fujiwara currently functions as Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´‚Äôs representative to the prestigious Nippon Kobud≈ç Ky≈çkai in Tokyo. History / Ohbata-Takamura Branch The Ohbata/Takamura branch originated with Shigeta Ohbata who received menkyo kaiden in 1895 from Katsukosuke Matsuoka. Shigeta was born in Kyoto in 1863 to a samurai named Ohbata Shibuharu. As a child Shigeta was enrolled in a school of Miura Y≈çshin Kory≈´. He moved to Edo in 1883 to continue his training in Totsuka-ha Y≈çshin Kory≈´ under the famed Hidemi Totsuka. In 1885 he commenced training in Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ directly under headmaster Katsunosuke Matsuoka. In 1895 after he was awarded a menkyo kaiden he was permitted to separate from the mainline school by Katsunosuke and subsequently founded his own line. In 1898 Shigeta Ohbata opened a dojo in the Asakusa district of Tokyo and named this dojo the Ohbata Eibukan. Shigeta Ohbata was a prominent budoka of the early 20th Century who fraternized with such notable budo personalities as Katsuta Hiratsuka/Y≈çshin-ry≈´, Masamizu Inazu/Y≈çshin Kory≈´, Jigoro Kano/J≈´d≈ç, Takeda Sokaku/Dait≈ç-ry≈´, Yoshida K≈çtar≈ç/Dait≈ç-ry≈´ & Shidare Yanagi-ryu and Takayoshi Katayama/Y≈çshin-ry≈´. In 1899 a son was born to Shigeta Ohbata named Hideyoshi. Shigeta saw to it that his son was extensively trained in Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ as he was expected to eventually succeed his father as the 2nd headmaster. In 1928 a son was born to Hideyoshi Ohbata named Yukiyoshi. During World War 2 Hideyoshi Ohbata was killed during the Allied siege of Saipan. Upon receiving this news, Shigeta Ohbata awarded his grandson Yukiyoshi Ohbata a menkyo kaiden and appointed him as his formal successor. At this time Shigeta also appointed a fully licensed instructor named Namishiro Matsuhiro to personally oversee his grandsons training. Shigeta Ohbata was killed and the Ohbata Eibukan dojo destroyed in 1945 during the Allied firebombing of Tokyo. In the decade following the war, Yukiyoshi Ohbata left Japan eventually settling in Stockholm, Sweden. During this period Yukiyoshi abandoned using the name Ohbata and adopted his mothers family name Takamura. In the 1960s Yukiyoshi married and immigrated to the United States. This move coincided with an explosion of American interest in Asian martial arts. Consequently, Yukiyoshi cultivated a dedicated group of students in the area of Northern California. Around 1968, Yukiyoshi Takamura renamed the art he taught Takamura-ha Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ and founded an organization to oversee the promotion of the art. This was the birth of the Takamura-ha Shind≈ç Y≈çshin Kai. This organization slowly grew in membership over the next twenty years and by the mid-1980s supported ten dojos and fifteen licensed instructors teaching in America, the Philippines, Japan and Europe. Yukiyoshi Takamura died in March 2000 at the age of 72. In the decade prior to his death he awarded three students menkyo kaiden in Takamura-ha Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´. These were Iso Takagi in Osaka, David Maynard in the United Kingdom, and Tobin E. Threadgill in the United States. In 2003, Iso Takagi and David Maynard retired from active teaching and Tobin E. Threadgill was asked to accept the title of kaich≈ç and oversee the organization worldwide. The Takamura-ha Shind≈ç Y≈çshin Kai continues today under the direction of Tobin E. Threadgill with its headquarters dojo located in Evergreen, Colorado. The organization currently has dojos operating in the United States, Spain (Palma de Mallorca, Ronda and Oviedo), Germany, Canada, France, Portugal (Lisbon), Finland, Sweden and New Zealand. Curriculum The Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ syllabus is heavily influenced by two different lines of Y≈çshin-ry≈´, the Akiyama Y≈çshin-ry≈´ (Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´) and Nakamura Y≈çshin Koryu (Totsuka-ha Y≈çshin- ry≈´). As a student of the teachings of H≈çz≈çin-ry≈´, Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ry≈´, Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´, Totsuka-ha Y≈çshin Kory≈´ and Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´, Matsuoka Katsunosuke consolidated many concepts of these various traditions into the foundational Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´. The curriculum of Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ is organized in a manner consistent with most classical schools of budo. The teachings are divided into three levels represented by the issuing of teaching licenses. These are shoden, ch≈´den and j≈çden gokui. An administrative license also exists which represents ultimate authority over the issuing of these licenses. This administrative license is called a menkyo kaiden. As with most classical schools of budo, there was no technical ranking system similar to the ky≈´/dan system commonly associated with modern forms of budo. Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ emphasizes grace and natural movement. Although Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ reflects the combination of the j≈´jutsu teachings of Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ and the Totsuka-ha Y≈çshin Kory≈´, its waza demonstrate a softer, more weapon influenced execution of technique. The Takamura branch includes further influence from Matsuzaki Shinkage-ry≈´ Hy≈çh≈ç. Influence on karate Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ was fundamental in the founding of one of Japan's most prominent styles of karate, Wad≈ç-ry≈´. The founder of Wad≈ç-ry≈´, Hironori Ohtsuka, studied Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ under a licensed instructor named Tatsusaburo Nakayama. Nakayama was the chief instructor of the Genbukan dojo in Shimotsuma city and the physical education teacher at Shimotsuma Middle School.

Smith was a reliable wicket-keeper and a right-hand batsman good enough to make 1000 runs in a season five times in the 1920s. He first played for Gloucestershire in 1912 and took over as regular wicket-keeper from Jack Board in 1914. From then until 1931, he was a regular in the side, often batting at No 3 in a team perennially reliant for its runs on just a few players. He played just one Test match, the first match ever against the West Indies at Lord's in 1928. He scored seven runs and took one catch, but made way in the next match for Harry Elliott, who in turn made way for George Duckworth for the third and final Test. Smith missed the whole of the 1932 season through illness, prompting Wisden in 1933 to an unusual tribute in its usually emotion-free pages: \\"Smith's absence,\\" it wrote, \\"meant something more than the loss of a thoroughly dependable wicket-keeper and a batsman capable of getting runs when runs were most needed, because, perhaps unconsciously, his fellow professionals had come to regard him as their father, and, in an unassuming way, he was a source of strength to his captain on the field. His value was equally marked in the dressing room and on the long journeys which continually had to be faced.\\" Smith did not appear in first-class cricket in 1933 or 1934, but in 1935, Gloucestershire having failed to find an adequate successor as wicket-keeper, he returned for 15 county matches, though he was ill and his batting was negligible. He died little over two years later. References * Wisden, 1933 edition, page 349.

The 5 Family Fist (‰∫îÂÆ∂Êã≥) is an important part of San Soo, and is commonly practiced in the Taishan region of the Guangdong province. Kung Fu San Soo as taught in China has many traditional forms and isometric exercises in its training regimen. Chin Siu Dek (Jimmy H. Woo), the man responsible for bringing Kung Fu San Soo to America, did not believe in the animal styles and hence taught only the 5 family styles (Ëî°Êùé‰Ωï‰ΩõÈõÑ). His words were, \\"We fight like men, not animals.\\" The name \\"Kung Fu San Soo\\" itself was chosen by Woo to simplify the pronunciation and meaning for American students, rather than using the complete names of the 5 families. Kung Fu San Soo originated for use in military combat and uses techniques designed to swiftly disable an attacker. Due to the fact San Soo is a practical martial art for self-defense and the techniques are intended for real fight scenarios, there are no competitions or tournaments for San Soo Kung Fu. Foundation and techniques San Soo was not created or taught as a tournament sport, but practitioners commonly incorporate forms of limited sparring.Black Belt Magazine, Jan 2004, The Reality of Kung Fu San Soo, Mark Cheng, p. 20 -22 Kung Fu San Soo does not attempt to emulate the motions of animals with elaborate forms.Hacker Cracker: A Journey from the Mean Streets of Brooklyn to the Frontiers of Cyberspace, Ejovi Nuwere/David Chanoff, p. 172 The basic premise of San Soo is there are no rules in a fight, so the style is techniques orientedNei Jia Quan: Internal Martial Arts, Jess O'Brien, p. 4 to remove a threat as quickly as possible through seizing the initiative and keeping the opponent off balance. Like many martial arts, San Soo can be used by smaller or weaker persons against larger or stronger assailants by utilizing technique and knowledge of reaction to make up for a lack of strength.Black Belt, Mar 1990, p.36, The Art of Action and Reaction, Dennis Kirby Techniques in San Soo are made up of Chin Na leverages, throwing, choking, joint-locking, strangling, strikes, and quick takedowns.Black Belt, Sep 1995, p.39, Wing Chun vs San Soo Kung Fu, John Bishop Targets include the eyes, nose, throat, base of the skull, neck, liver, spleen, kidneys, testicles, and knees, and for this reason, most San Soo practitioners do not engage in full contact competition/sport fighting. Techniques are commonly practiced in unrehearsed 'freestyle workout' sessions with carefully controlled contact. San Soo practitioners claim this method of training builds an automatic and flexible response in much the same way we learn language a few words at a time until we have full and versatile vocabularies. Training methods, historic interpretations, and modifications exist from school to school among the modern descendants of San Soo. San Soo also incorporates training with the use of many traditional Chinese weapons. These include the staff (5', 7' and 9'), broadsword, hooking or ripping swords, baat cham do (butterfly swords), three-section staff, tai-chi sword, knife, spear, kwon do, chas and chain. The baton, although not a traditional Chinese weapon, was a weapon that Jimmy Woo specialized in and incorporated into the art. Naming San Soo is a distinct fighting style from the similarly named Chinese martial art San Shou. Although they share the same name in Chinese (Êï£Êâã - meaning 'free hand'), context is used to differentiate between the two. First, the difference in dialect. San Shou (Êï£Êâã) is Mandarin (Beijing). San Sao (Êï£Êâã) is Cantonese (Hong Kong). San Soo (Êï£Êâã) is Sei-yap (or Toisanese) dialect within the Cantonese dialect, a sub-dialect if you will. History The Japanese killed numerous skilled martial artists pre-World War II, and during the war. Many great fighters that were unfortunate enough to live in an area that the Japanese were occupying were killed because they were seen as a threat, and a possible leader for organizing resistance movements. So, that eliminated many talented Kung-Fu men. Then after the Cultural Revolution and the Communists took over, the same process happened again. The Communists killed anyone who they perceived as a threat. Teachers, Doctors, Scientists, and Kung-Fu practitioners. Again, anyone who might organize a resistance movement. During the 1960s, in an effort to revive the Kung-Fu martial arts in China, the government looked to any and all remaining Kung-Fu practitioners in Mainland China. They took what was useful, as well as any techniques from foreign martial arts they thought were useful, and made the Chinese Red Army San Shou (Êï£Êâã). This was only taught to the Army, and to the Police Forces. The specific or proper name of this art is Tsoi Li Ho Fut Hung. In China, many centuries ago, there were three original families that contributed information from their systems in order to create this art. They built a monastery and developed a combined defense system. These families are Tsoi, Li, and Ho. Fut was the philosophical or religious base and originally made reference to Buddha. The Hung family was added later in order to increase power, physical conditioning and dynamics. Notable practitioners =Jimmy H. Woo= Kung Fu San Soo was brought to America by a Chin Family practitioner, Chin Siu Dek, Chan Siu Duk, or Chen Shou Jue (Èô≥Â£ΩÁàµ, Chen2 Shou4 Jue2), depending on the dialect. Entering the United States under the Chinese Exclusion Act, and leaving China on the eve of the Japanese Occupation, Chin Siu Dek took the name, \\"Jimmy Haw Woo\\" as a lifetime pseudonym. Most believe he was born around 1905‚Äì10. He died in Southern California on February 14, 1991, and is credited with bringing the Five Family Style (‰∫îÂÆ∂Êã≥) of Tsoi Li Ho Fut Hung (Ëî°Êùé‰Ωï‰ΩõÈõÑ), or San Soo Kung Fu to America after learning primarily from his Great-Uncle, Chan Siu Hung, at the Hung Sing Goon school in Taishan, Guangdong Province, China . Kung Fu San Soo tradition holds that Chin Siu Dek lived and grew up just across the river from this school in the village of Sanba. Sadly, this school was later destroyed by the communists in the cultural revolution. Also, one of his classmates was Chan Siu Hung's own son, Chan Sai Mo (Chen Shi Wu [Mand]). As Jimmy H. Woo, Chin Siu Dek opened his own studio in El Monte, California to teach his family art in about 1959.The Grand Master Jimmy H. Woo Kung-Fu San Soo Associates =Benjamin Brandt= Master Benjamin Solomon Brandt, born September 4, 1950, was a first-generation master under Jimmy Woo who ran studios in La Habra, CA and Monterey Park, CA. Ben Brandt is the Incorporator of the International Kung Fu San Soo Association, established on September 15, 1983 in Monterey Park, CA. He died on December 24, 1997. According to first hand accounts, Ben Brandt was an innovator of San Soo exercises and began experimenting with variations of style when other masters were not. Master Ben Brandt held numerous exhibitions and demonstrated San Soo workouts to varying audiences. Master Ben Brandt was one of Jimmy Woo's closest and most trusted students, and is still remembered by the American San Soo community. =Kathy Long= 5 Time World Champion Kickboxer Kathy Long holds an 8th Degree Black Belt/Sash in Kung Fu San Soo =Gerald Okamura= Hollywood Actor and Stuntman =Ralph Johnson= Drummer for Earth, Wind & Fire References  External links  *History, Lineage, and San Soo sections of Sonora San Soo *Reeder's Kung Fu San Soo School *Sudden Violence: The Art Of San Soo Greg Jones * Category:Chinese martial arts ","title":"San Soo"},{"id":"3645626","text":"The Carnival of Venice () is an annual festival held in Venice, Italy. The carnival ends with the Christian celebration of Lent, forty days before Easter, on Shrove Tuesday (Marted√¨ Grasso or Mardi Gras), the day before Ash Wednesday. The festival is world-famous for its elaborate masks. History According to legend, the Carnival of Venice started following the military victory of the Venetian Republic over the Patriarch of Aquileia, Ulrico di Treven in the year 1162. In the honour of this victory, the people started to dance and gather in San Marco Square. Apparently, this festival started in that period and became official in the Renaissance.Danilo Reato, Storia del carnivale di Venezia, Venezia, Assessorato alla Cultura della Provincia di Venezia, 1988. In the seventeenth century, the baroque carnival was a way to save the prestigious image of Venice in the world.Gilles Bertrand, Histoire du carnaval de Venise, XIe-XXIe si√®cle, Paris, Pigmalion, 2013, p. 37-94. It was very famous during the eighteenth century.Stefania Bertelli, Il Carnivale di Venezia nel Settecento, Roma, Jouvence, 1992. It encouraged licence and pleasure, but it was also used to protect Venetians from present and future anguish.James H. Johnson, Venice incognito: masks in the Serene Republic, Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011; Gilles Bertrand, Histoire du carnaval de Venise, XIe-XXIe si√®cle, Paris, Pigmalion, p. 95-235. However, under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor and later Emperor of Austria, Francis II, the festival was outlawed entirely in 1797 and the use of masks became strictly forbidden. It reappeared gradually in the nineteenth century, but only for short periods and above all for private feasts, where it became an occasion for artistic creations.Gilles Bertrand, Histoire du carnaval de Venise, XIe-XXIe si√®cle, Paris, Pigmalion, 2013, p. 237-310. After a long absence, the Carnival returned in 1979.Alessandro Bressanello, Il carnivale in et√† moderna: 30 agni di carnivale a Venezia 1980-2010, Studio LT2, 2010; Fulvio Roiter, Carnaval de Venise, Lausanne, Payot, 1981. The Italian government decided to bring back the history and culture of Venice and sought to use the traditional Carnival as the centrepiece of its efforts. The redevelopment of the masks began as the pursuit of some Venetian college students for the tourist trade. Since then, approximately 3 million visitors come to Venice every year for the Carnival. One of the most important events is the contest for la maschera pi√π bella (\\"the most beautiful mask\\") which is judged by a panel of international costume and fashion designers. Here are the winners: *2019 : I bambini della luce by Horst Raack, best traditional costume matrimonio all' Italiana by Borboni si Nasce, most original costume Paguri by Nicola Pignoli and Ilaria Cavalli *2018 : L'amore al tempo del campari by Paolo Brando *2017 : Il signore del bosco by Luigi di Como *2016 : I bagnanti di Senegalia by Anna and Lorenzo Marconi, best costume for the official theme I caretti siciliani by Salvatore Occhipinti and Gugliemo Miceli *2015 : Le stelle dell'amore by Horst Raack, best costume for the official theme La regina della cucina veneziana by Tanja Schulz-Hess, most creative costume Monsieur Sofa et Madame Coco by Lorenzo Marconi *2014 : Una giornata in campagna by Horst Raack, and Radice Madre by Maria Roan di Villavera *2013 : Alla Ricerca del Tempo Perduto by Anna Marconi, most colourful costume Luna Park *2012 : Il servizio da th√® del settecento (teatime) by Horst Raack, most creative costume Oceano by Jacqueline Spieweg *2011 : La famille Faberg√© by Horst Raack, and Ommagio a Venezia by Paolo and Cinzia Pagliasso and Anna Rotonaia, best costume for the official theme 19th century by Lea Luongsoredju and Roudi Verbaanderd *2010 : Pantegane from England *2009 : The voyagers of Marco Polo by Horst Raack and Tanja Schulz-Hess *2008 : Luna park by Tanja Schulz-Hess *2007 : La Montgolfiera by Tanja Schulz-Hess In February 2020, Veneto regional governor Luca Zaia announced the decision to call off Carnival in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus. Carnival masks A selection of masks Masks have always been an important feature of the Venetian carnival. Traditionally people were allowed to wear them between the festival of Santo Stefano (St. Stephen's Day, December 26) and the end of the carnival season at midnight of Shrove Tuesday (movable, but during February or early March). As masks were also allowed on Ascension and from October 5 to Christmas, people could spend a large portion of the year in disguise. Maskmakers (mascherari) enjoyed a special position in society, with their own laws and their own guild, with their own statute dated 10 April 1436. Mascherari belonged to the fringe of painters and were helped in their task by sign-painters who drew faces onto plaster in a range of different shapes and paying extreme. Venetian masks can be made of leather, porcelain or using the original glass technique. The original masks were rather simple in design, decoration, and often had a symbolic and practical function. Nowadays, most Italian masks are made with the application of gesso and gold leaf and are hand-painted using natural feathers and gems to decorate. However, this makes them rather expensive when compared to the widespread, low-quality masks produced mainly by American factories. This competition accelerates the decline of this historical craftsmanship peculiar to the city of Venice. Several distinct styles of mask are worn in the Venice Carnival, some with identifying names.Danilo Reato, Les masques de Venise, Paris, Hersher, 1991 (first published in italian, 1988) People with different occupations wore different masks. =Origin= There is less evidence explaining the motive for the earliest mask being worn in Venice. One scholar argues that covering the face in public was a uniquely Venetian response to one of the most rigid class hierarchies in European history. During Carnival, the sumptuary laws were suspended, and people could dress as they liked, instead of according to the rules that were set down in law for their profession and social class. Masked men threw eggshells filled with perfume during carnival. The first documented sources mentioning the use of masks in Venice can be found as far back as the 13th century.Janet Sethre, The souls of Venice, 2003. Page 132. The Great Council made it a crime for masked people to throw scented eggs. These ovi odoriferi were eggshells that were usually filled with rose water perfume, and tossed by young men at their friends or at young women they admired. However, in some cases, the eggs were filled with ink or other damaging substances. Gambling in public was normally illegal, except during Carnival. The document decrees that masked persons were forbidden to gamble. Another law in 1339 forbade Venetians from wearing vulgar disguises and visiting convents while masked. The law also prohibited painting one's face, or wearing false beards or wigs. Near the end of the Republic, the wearing of the masks in daily life was severely restricted. By the 18th century, it was limited only to about three months from December 26. The masks were traditionally worn with decorative beads matching in colour. =Bauta= The bauta (sometimes referred as ba√πtta) is a mask, today often heavily gilded though originally simple stark white, which is designed to comfortably cover the entire face; this traditional grotesque piece of art was characterized by the inclusion of an over-prominent nose, a thick supraorbital ridge, a projecting \\"chin line\\", and no mouth. The mask's beak-like chin is designed to enable the wearer to talk, eat, and drink without having to remove it, thereby preserving the wearer's anonymity. The bauta was often accompanied by a red or black cape and a tricorn. In the 18th century, together with a black circular or semicircular clasped cape called a tabarro (and zendale hood) the bauta had become a standardized society mask and disguise regulated by the Venetian government.Ignatio Toscani: Die venezianische Gesellschaftsmaske. Ein Versuch zur Deutung ihrer Ausformung, ihrer Entstehungsgr√ºnde und ihrer Funktion. Diss. Saarbr√ºcken 1970. It was obligatory to wear it at certain political decision-making events when all citizens were required to act anonymously as peers. Only citizens (i.e., men) had the right to use the bauta. Its role was similar to the anonymizing processes invented to guarantee general, direct, free, equal and secret ballots in modern democracies. Also, the bearing of weapons along with the mask was specifically prohibited by law and enforceable by the Venetian police. Given this history and its grotesque design elements, the bauta was usually worn by men, but many paintings done in the 18th century also depict women wearing this mask and tricorn hat. The Ridotto and The Perfume Seller by Pietro Longhi are two examples of this from the 1750s. =Colombina= The Colombina (also known as Columbine and as a Colombino) is a half-mask, only covering the wearer's eyes, nose, and upper cheeks. It is often highly decorated with gold, silver, crystals, and feathers. It is held up to the face by a baton or is tied with ribbon as with most other Venetian masks. The Colombina mask is named after a stock character in the Commedia dell'arte: Colombina was a maidservant and soubrette who was an adored part of the Italian theatre for generations. It is said it was designed for an actress because she did not wish to have her beautiful face covered completely. In fact, the Colombina is entirely a modern creation. There are no historic paintings depicting its use on the stage or in social life. While both men and women now wear this mask, it began as a woman's analog to the bauta. =Medico Della Peste (The Plague Doctor)= A Medico della Peste mask. The Medico della peste, with its long beak, is one of the most bizarre and recognizable of the Venetian masks, though it did not start out as carnival mask at all but as a method of preventing the spread of disease. The striking design originates from 17th-century French physician Charles de Lorme who adopted the mask together with other sanitary precautions while treating plague victims.Christine M. Boeckl, Images of plague and pestilence: iconography and iconology (Truman State University Press, 2000), p. 27. The mask is often white, consisting of a hollow beak and round eyeholes covered with crystal discs, creating a bespectacled effect. Its use as a carnival mask is entirely a modern convention, and today these masks are often much more decorative. Although the mask and costume is worn almost exclusively by males, the enhancement in decoration also suggests that women are now more likely to wear the mask and costume than in previous years at the Carnival. The plague doctors who followed De Lorme's example wore the usual black hat and long black cloak as well as the mask, white gloves and a staff (so as to be able to move patients without having to come into physical contact with them). They hoped these precautions would prevent them contracting the disease. The mask was originally beaked with a purpose in congruence with the miasmatic theory of disease practiced at that time: the hollow beak allowed for the containment of flowers and other sweet-smelling substances designed to keep away the foul odors that were thought to spread infection. Those who wear the plague doctor mask often also wear the associated clothing of the plague doctor. The popularity of the Medico della peste among carnival celebrants can be seen as a memento mori. =Moretta/Servetta muta= The moretta (meaning dark one) or servetta muta (meaning mute servant woman) was a small strapless black velvet oval mask with wide eyeholes and no lips or mouth worn by patrician women. It derived from the visard mask invented in France in the sixteenth century, but differed in not having a hole to speak through. The mask was only just large enough to conceal a woman's identity and was held in place by the wearer biting on a button or bit (the women wearing this mask were unable to speak, hence muta) and was often finished off with a veil. The Rhinoceros by Pietro Longhi, sometimes called Clara the rhinoceros, depicts this mask in use in 1751. It fell into disuse about 1760. =Volto (Larva)= Volto or larva mask The volto (Italian for face) or larva (meaning ghost in Latin) is the iconic modern Venetian mask: it is often made of stark white porcelain or thick plastic, though also frequently gilded and decorated, and is commonly worn with a tricorn and cloak. The \\"volto\\" is also quite heavier than a typical mask and has a much tighter fit; many people who experience claustrophobia do not wear the \\"volto\\" at the Carnival. If worn by a woman, who are the most common wearers of the volto at the modern festival, it is typically worn with a headdress, scarf, veil, another mask, or a combination of all four. It is secured in the back with a ribbon. Unlike the moretta muta, the volto covers the entire face of the wearer including the whole of the chin. Unlike a typical mask, it also extends farther back to just before the ears and upwards to the top of the forehead; also unlike the moretta muta, it depicts the nose and lips in simple facial expressions. Unlike the bauta, the volto cannot be worn while eating and drinking because the coverage of the chin and cheeks is too complete and tight (although the jaw on some original commedia masks was hinged, this is not a commedia mask and so is never hinged‚Äîthe lips are always sealed). =Pantalone= Another classic character from the Italian stage, Pantalone, possibly stemming from the Italian \\"pianta il leone\\" referencing the conquests of Venice and the origin of this character, is usually represented as a sad old man with an oversized nose like the beak of a crow with high brows and slanted eyes (meant to signify intelligence on the stage). Like other commedia masks, Pantalone is also a half mask. This mask is almost exclusively worn by men, although its popularity at the modern festival has declined . =Arlecchino= Arlecchino's half-mask is painted black with an ape-like nose and a \\"bump\\" to signify a devil's horn Arlecchino, meaning harlequin in Italian, is a zanni character of the commedia. He is meant to be a kind of \\"noble savage\\", devoid of reason and full of emotion, a peasant, a servant, even a slave. His originally wooden and later leather half-mask painted black depicts him as having a short, blunt, ape-like nose, a set of wide, round, arching eyebrows, a rounded beard, and always a \\"bump\\" upon his forehead meant to signify a devil's horn. He is a theatrical counterpoint to and often servant of Pantalone, and the two characters often appeared together on the stage. =Zanni= A leather version of a Zanni mask, profile view The Zanni class of characters is another classic of the stage. Theirs is a half mask in leather, presenting themselves with low forehead, bulging eyebrows and a long nose with a reverse curve towards the end. It is said that the longer the nose, the more stupid the character. The low forehead is also seen as a sign of stupidity. The zanni are often the supporting characters in a commedia performance, often fulfilling similar societal roles as Arlecchino, though with smaller parts In popular culture The short story The Cask of Amontillado, written by Edgar Allan Poe, is set in Venice during the carnival. Venetian masks feature prominently in the films Eyes Wide Shut and Marco Bellocchio's The Witches' Sabbath. Stores that supplied the masks include both Ca' MacanaSee Pauline Frommer's Italy by Keith Bain, Reid Bramblett, Pippa de Bruyn, William Fink, Barbie Latza Nadeau p. 333 and Il CanovaccioFrommer's Northern Italy: Including Venice, Milan & the Lakes by John Moretti p. 168 in Venice. Carnivale is depicted in the 2009 video game Assassin's Creed II. The main character, Ezio Auditore, is assisted by the artist Leonardo da Vinci in hunting down and assassinating the corrupt Doge of Venice Marco Barbarigo during Carnivale; a golden mask, which Ezio must obtain to enter a private party held by the Doge, plays a significant role in this part of the game. Carnivale is also depicted in the 2005 video game Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves. The first episode of the game is set during the 2001 Carnivale, and large enemies wear masks. In the children's book series Magic Tree House by Mary Pope Osborne, Carnivale is prominently featured as the eponymous festival in Carnival at Candlelight, the series' thirty-third entry. In this adventure, Jack and Annie travel back in time on a mission to prevent Venice from being destroyed by a flood.

Directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot the film stars Suzy Delair as Jenny Lamour, Bernard Blier as Maurice Martineau, Louis Jouvet as Inspector Antoine and Simone Renant as Dora. The film was Clouzot's third directorial effort, and the first after the controversy of Le corbeau. Without having the novel on hand, Clouzot and Jean Ferry based the film on memory and deviated significantly from the original story. The film was released in France and was popular with both audiences and critics. On the film's re- release in the United States in 2002, it continued to receive praise from critics as one of the director's best films.  Plot  Paris, December 1946. Jenny Lamour (Delair) wants to succeed in the theatre. Her husband and accompanist is Maurice Martineau (Blier), a mild-mannered but jealous man. When he finds out that Jenny has been making eyes at Brignon, a lecherous old businessman, in order to further her career, he loses his temper and threatens Brignon with death. Despite this, Jenny goes to a secret rendezvous at Brignon's apartment. He is murdered the same evening. The criminal investigations are led by Inspector Antoine (Jouvet). Production Quai des Orf√®vres was directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and was his first film in four years. Clouzot had been banned from film making after the controversy after the release Le corbeau and due to Clouzot's collaboration with the German- owned company Continental Films. During Clouzot's inactivity, he wrote scripts for films that were never released. He met with producer Anatole Eliacheff who offered to financially back Clouzot's next film provided that it would be a commercial film. Clouzot suggested the Belgian murder mystery L√©gitime d√©fense () by Stanislas-Andr√© Steeman which he had read during the Occupation. This production was meant to be a commission to end Clouzot's four years of enforced inactivity and take advantage of the new popular style of crime literature. Clouzot had previously written screenplays based on Steeman's work including Georges Lacombe's Le Dernier des six (1943) and his own debut, L'Assassin habite au 21 (1942). Eliacheff agreed and shortly after sold the rights to another producer, Roger de Venloo. When trying to find a copy of L√©gitime d√©fense to re-read, Clouzot found that it was out of print. Clouzot wrote a letter to Steeman to obtain a copy and began to adapt the story from memory with writer Jean Ferry. By the time a copy of the book arrived, Clouzot and Ferry had already written the script which deviated greatly from Steeman's novel. The changes in the script include the identity of the real murderer, the settings of the action, and the introduction of the lesbian photographer character Dora Monier.Mayne 2007, p.88 Quai des Orf√®vres was also a comeback film for director-actor Louis Jouvet with whom Clouzot had become good friends before World War II. Jouvet accepted the part of Inspector Antoine on the condition that a flexible shooting schedule would be allowed and that Clouzot would cast some of Jouvet's troupe members in the film. Clouzot agreed and cast Leo Lapara as one of Antoine's colleagues and Fernand Ren√© as the music hall director. Clouzot cast Charles Dullin as Brignon, the murder victim. It would be the last film appearance for Dullin, who died in 1949. The main female lead was written for Suzy Delair who was Clouzot's romantic partner at the time of filming. The film went into production on 3 February 1947 and finished filming on 10 May.

In 1947, it was the fourth most popular film in France, drawing 5.5 million spectators.Lloyd 2007, p. 30 The film has had several theatrical revivals in France since its original release. The film was released in New York City in March 1948 under the title Jenny Lamour. Quai des orf√®vres was re-released for a limited run within America on 25 October 2002. =Critical reception= The film received positive reception from critics on its initial release in France. Pierre Chartier of France-Libre wrote that the film was \\"a watershed in the history of the French crime film.\\" Jean Desternes of Combat praised the director Clouzot, referring to him as \\"not just a film director. He's a creative artist who sticks to his initial idea, works it out in shots, words, actions.\\" Fran√ßois Chalais wrote a positive review in Carrefour, stating the film \\"commands the keenest admiration at any given moment, the dialogue of the film is the work of a truly great and extremely subtle dramatist. That's one of M. Clouzot's most remarkable traits: he knows how to write.\\" At the 1947 Venice International Film Festival, Clouzot won the International Prize for Best Director for the film.Crisp, 1997. p 427 The film received positive critical reception in the United States on its initial release. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times referred to the film as \\"a fascinating and penetrating film\\". Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post referred to the film as \\"a fine, engrossing French crime film\\". Variety gave the film a positive review, proclaiming that \\"In every respect [Quai des Orf√®vres] is outstanding.\\" In 1949, the film won an Edgar Award for Best Foreign film. Modern reception of the film has also been positive. French critics have continued to praise the film since its release. In 1964 Jean Mitry wrote that the film is \\"one of the few films‚Äîwith Renoir's Rules of the Game, All About Eve, and two or three others‚Äîwhich allows us to think that the cinema, like the novel and the theater, can some day be an instrument for exploring the human soul.\\" In 1986, Michel Perez wrote a review for Le Matin de Paris stating that Quai des Orf√®vres \\"was nothing less than the most powerful, best constructed, best written, best directed and most telling film about society of its day.\\" In 1995, a critics poll in the French film magazine Positif placed Quai des Orf√®vres as the second greatest French thriller of all time.Lloyd 2007, p. 63 The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating, based on 32 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.34/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Henri Georges-Clouzot's engrossing noir explores the troubles of post-war France and the line dividing social struggle and criminality\\". At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 89, based on 10 reviews. =Home media= Quai des Orf√®vres was released in North America on DVD by The Criterion Collection on 27 May 2003. In the United Kingdom, a DVD was released on 30 April 2007 by Optimum Releasing. The Criterion DVD is now out of print.

It is an example of Italian Neorealism. In July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival. Plot The film tells the story of Domenico, a young man who forgoes the latter part of his education when his family is in need of money. Applying for a job at a big city corporation, he goes through a bizarre series of exams, physical tests and interviews. During a brief respite from the tests, he meets Antonietta, a young girl who has similarly forgone her schooling when in need of money to support herself and her mother. Through the course of this meeting, they have coffee at a local cafe and shyly discuss their ambitions and lives. Domenico is attracted to her, but they are quickly separated when they land jobs in different departments. Meeting with a superior, he is informed that no clerical positions are available, and subsequently takes a job as a messenger while awaiting a better position. Domenico observes the other employees, at times noting optimistically their kindnesses, and other times the effect of the office gloom on them. Often disappointed in his endeavors to find Antonietta, he sees her one day among two other young men. He does not approach her, but later bumps into her. She invites him to a New Years Eve party held for the workers, which he decides to attend later in the evening. Arriving at the party alone, and becoming aware of his awkward loneliness and Antonietta's absence, he accepts the invitation of an older couple to sit with them. He observes the other youth, dancing and having fun, while he remains silently in the company of the couple. When an older woman asks him to dance, he begins to drink and eventually feel a part of the revels of the party. The night culminates in a simple and free dance in which all the guests participate. Returning to work the following day, he is offered a recently vacated desk of an employee since departed (an aspiring writer, presumed to have killed himself). Before being able to settle into the desk, however, the much older staff around him become disquiet, and complain about the number of years that they have waited to sit at the 'prestigious' desk Domenico has found. He learns that he would have to wait 20 years to sit in the first row of the chamber. He is moved to the back in a dimly lit corner, and, as the film ends, Domenico begins his first day in his \\"job for life\\", committing himself to the desperation of a banal career.

It can be used as a stand-alone pump, a hydraulic motor or an automotive air conditioning compressor. Description Axial piston pump. Cutaway side view diagram Axial piston pump - 3D Render with the parts labeled 3D-Animation An axial piston pump has a number of pistons (usually an odd number) arranged in a circular array within a housing which is commonly referred to as a cylinder block, rotor or barrel. This cylinder block is driven to rotate about its axis of symmetry by an integral shaft that is, more or less, aligned with the pumping pistons (usually parallel but not necessarily). *Mating surfaces. One end of the cylinder block is convex and wears against a mating surface on a stationary valve plate. The inlet and outlet fluid of the pump pass through different parts of the sliding interface between the cylinder block and valve plate. The valve plate has two semi-circular ports that allow inlet of the operating fluid and exhaust of the outlet fluid respectively. *Protruding pistons. The pumping pistons protrude from the opposite end of the cylinder block. There are numerous configurations used for the exposed ends of the pistons but in all cases they bear against a cam. In variable displacement units, the cam is movable and commonly referred to as a swashplate, yoke or hanger. For conceptual purposes, the cam can be represented by a plane, the orientation of which, in combination with shaft rotation, provides the cam action that leads to piston reciprocation and thus pumping. The angle between a vector normal to the cam plane and the cylinder block axis of rotation, called the cam angle, is one variable that determines the displacement of the pump or the amount of fluid pumped per shaft revolution. Variable displacement units have the ability to vary the cam angle during operation whereas fixed displacement units do not. *Reciprocating pistons. As the cylinder block rotates, the exposed ends of the pistons are constrained to follow the surface of the cam plane. Since the cam plane is at an angle to the axis of rotation, the pistons must reciprocate axially as they precess about the cylinder block axis. The axial motion of the pistons is sinusoidal. During the rising portion of the piston's reciprocation cycle, the piston moves toward the valve plate. Also, during this time, the fluid trapped between the buried end of the piston and the valve plate is vented to the pump's discharge port through one of the valve plate's semi-circular ports - the discharge port. As the piston moves toward the valve plate, fluid is pushed or displaced through the discharge port of the valve plate. *Effect of precession. When the piston is at the top of the reciprocation cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the pump's inlet port. As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the pump's inlet to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the pumping chamber and inlet port is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the discharge port again and the pumping cycle starts over. *Variable displacement. In a variable displacement pump, if the vector normal to the cam plane (swash plate) is set parallel to the axis of rotation, there is no movement of the pistons in their cylinders. Thus there is no output. Movement of the swash plate controls pump output from zero to maximum. There are two kinds of variable-displacement axial piston pumps: ** direct displacement control pump, a kind of axial piston pump with a direct displacement control. A direct displacement control uses a mechanical lever attached to the swashplate of the axial piston pump. Higher system pressures require more force to move that lever, making direct displacement control only suitable for light or medium duty pumps. Heavy duty pumps require servo control.Danfoss. \\"Applications Manual: Transmission Circuit Recommendations\\". p. 6 A direct displacement control pump contains linkages and springs and in some cases magnets rather than a shaft to a motor located outside of the pump (thereby reducing the number of moving parts), keeping parts protected and lubricated and reducing the resistance against the flow of liquid. ** servo control pump. *Pressure. In a typical pressure-compensated pump, the swash plate angle is adjusted through the action of a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous pump output flow is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the swash plate angle to increase pump output flow so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control for this type of pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the swash plate is driven towards zero angle (piston stroke nearly zero) and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the swash plate is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The swash plate angle will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will operate at full stroke. This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the flow demand.http://www.rotarypower.com/a-range.php Tuesday, 17 December 2019 Design difficulties Designers have a number of problems to overcome in designing axial piston pumps. One is managing to be able to manufacture a pump with the fine tolerances necessary for efficient operation. The mating faces between the rotary piston-cylinder assembly and the stationary pump body have to be almost a perfect seal while the rotary part turns at perhaps 3000 rpm. The pistons are usually less than half an inch (13 mm) in diameter with similar stroke lengths. Keeping the wall to piston seal tight means that very small clearances are involved and that materials have to be closely matched for similar coefficient of expansion. The pistons have to be drawn outwards in their cylinder by some means. On small pumps this can be done by means of a spring inside the cylinder that forces the piston up the cylinder. Inlet fluid pressure can also be arranged so that the fluid pushes the pistons up the cylinder. Often a vane pump is located on the same drive shaft to provide this pressure and it also allows the pump assembly to draw fluid against some suction head from the reservoir, which is not an attribute of the unaided axial piston pump. Another method of drawing pistons up the cylinder is to attach the cylinder heads to the surface of the swash plate. In that way the piston stroke is totally mechanical. However, the designer's problem of lubricating the swash plate face (a sliding contact) is made even more difficult. Internal lubrication of the pump is achieved by use of the operating fluid--normally called hydraulic fluid. Most hydraulic systems have a maximum operating temperature, limited by the fluid, of about 120 ¬∞C (250 ¬∞F) so that using that fluid as a lubricant brings its own problems. In this type of pump the leakage from the face between the cylinder housing and the body block is used to cool and lubricate the exterior of the rotating parts. The leakage is then carried off to the reservoir or to the inlet side of the pump again. Hydraulic fluid that has been used is always cooled and passed through micrometre-sized filters before recirculating through the pump. Uses Despite the problems indicated above this type of pump can contain most of the necessary circuit controls integrally (the swash-plate angle control) to regulate flow and pressure, be very reliable and allow the rest of the hydraulic system to be very simple and inexpensive. Axial piston pumps are used to power the hydraulic systems of jet aircraft, being gear-driven off of the turbine engine's main shaft, The system used on the F-14 used a 9-piston pump that produced a standard system operating pressure of 3000 psi and a maximum flow of 84 gallons per minute. Automotive air conditioning compressors for cabin cooling are nowadays mostly based around the axial piston pump design (others are based on the scroll compressor or rotary vane pump ones instead) in order to contain their weight and space requirement in the vehicle's engine bay and reduce vibrations. They're available in fixed displacement and dynamically adjusted variable displacement variants, and, depending upon the compressor's design, the actual rotating swashplate either directly drives a set of pistons mated to its edges through a set of hemispherical metal shoes, or a nutating plate on which a set of pistons are mounted by means of rods. They are also used in some pressure washers. For example K√§rcher has several models powered by axial piston pumps with three pistons. Axial reciprocating motors are also used to power many machines. They operate on the same principle as described above, except that the circulating fluid is provided under considerable pressure and the piston housing is made to rotate and provide shaft power to another machine. A common use of an axial reciprocating motor is to power small earthmoving plant such as skid loader machines. Another use is to drive the screws of torpedoes.

He became an ordained priest in his later life. Tom Killick was a right-handed batsman who generally either opened the innings or went in at the fall of the first wicket. Educated at St Paul's School, he played a few matches for Middlesex as a 19-year-old in 1926. He then went up to Jesus College, Cambridge, but was unimpressive in the freshmen's trial match in 1927. However, he was picked for Middlesex against the University team and scored 94 and an unbeaten 42: he was then chosen for the next few university matches but, apart from an 80 that drew comment from Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for slow scoring, did little and failed to win a Blue. He played regularly for Middlesex in the second half of the season. The following season, 1928, he failed again in two early games for Cambridge and again turned to Middlesex, scoring 82 in his second match for the county. Given a further trial at Cambridge, he scored 100 against Surrey and 161 against Sussex, finishing top of the university averages and winning a Blue. In the 1928 season as a whole, he scored 1231 runs, at an average of 38. In 1929, Killick had his most successful season and his only taste of Test cricket. England's selectors experimented with young players in the first two matches of the 1929 series against South Africa, and Killick was picked to partner Herbert Sutcliffe as an opener. In the first match, at Edgbaston, he scored 31 and 23 in a game that ended as a rather more even draw than England had expected. At Lord's, he scored just 3 and 24 as the match was again drawn and he was dropped as England ended the experiment with youth and brought back Frank Woolley and Ted Bowley, a move that helped bring success in two of the remaining three Tests. Killick scored 1384 runs at an average of 44 runs per innings in 1929, but played only one first-class match - Gentlemen v Players at Lord's - after the end of the Cambridge season. The next year, 1930, he again played through the Cambridge season, making 903 runs at an average of 47, but then did not appear again. Across the 1930s, as he first studied for the Anglican priesthood and then worked for the Church, he played infrequent first-class cricket, not appearing at all between 1934 and 1938. He reappeared in one match for Free Foresters in 1946, but that was his last first-class game. As an ordained Anglican priest, he was a chaplain at Harrow School and later a vicar near Letchworth. He served in West Africa as an army chaplain in the Second World War and then became vicar of Bishop's Stortford. He died from a heart attack, while playing in an inter-diocesan cricket match between clergy from the St Albans and Coventry dioceses, aged 46.

It consists of nine odes, based on the Biblical canticles. Most of these are found in the Old Testament, but the final ode is taken from the Magnificat and Song of Zechariah from the New Testament.For clarity, this article will use the term \\"canticle\\" to refer to the original biblical text, and \\"ode\\" to refer to the composed liturgical hymns. The canon dates from the 7th century and was either devised or introduced into the Greek language by St. Andrew of Crete, whose penitential Great Canon is still used on certain occasions during Great Lent. It was further developed in the 8th century by Sts. John of Damascus and Cosmas of Jerusalem, and in the 9th century by Sts. Joseph the Hymnographer and Theophanes the Branded. Over time the canon came to replace the kontakion, a vestigal form of which is still used on several occasions and which has been incorporated into the performance of the canon. Each canon develops a specific theme, such as repentance or honouring a particular saint. Sometimes more than one canon can be chanted together, as frequently happens at Matins. Biblical canticles The nine biblical canticles are: # The Ode of Moses in Exodus () # The Ode of Moses in Deuteronomy () (Note: this is sung only on Tuesdays in Lent) # The Prayer of Anna the mother of Samuel the Prophet () # The Prayer of Habakkuk the Prophet (Habakkuk ) # The Prayer of Isaiah the Prophet (Isaiah ) # The Prayer of Jonah the Prophet (Jonah ) # The Prayer of the Three Holy Children (Daniel 3:26-56)* # The Song of the Three Holy Children (The Benedicite, Daniel 3:57-88)* # The Song of the Theotokos (The Magnificat, Luke ) and the Prayer of Zacharias the father of the Forerunner (The Benedictus, ) ::*These odes are found only in the Septuagint. Verse numberings according to Psalter, which differs from Brenton. These biblical canticles are normally found in the back of the Psalter used by Orthodox churches, where they are often printed with markings to indicate where to begin inserting the irmos and troparia of the canons. Nowadays, however, the canticles are only sung in large monasteries or, in Russian practice, with the triode on the weekdays of Lent. Performance As with all other Orthodox church music, a canon is sung by a choir or cantor in a cappella chant. An ode of the canon is begun by singing the Biblical canticle from its beginning. At some point, this is interrupted by an introductory stanza called an irmos (\\"link\\"), which poetically connects the theme of the biblical canticle to the subject of the canon. Following the irmos and sung alternately with the subsequent verses of the Biblical canticle are a series of hymns (troparia), set in the same melody and meter as the irmos, that expand on the theme of the canon. The ode is completed with a final stanza called the katavasia. This might be a repetition of the irmos, the irmos of the last canon when more than one canon is being sung together, the irmos of the canon for an upcoming major feast day, or some other verse prescribed by the service books. (Katavasia means \\"coming down\\" and the verse is so called because as originally performed the two choirs would descend from their places on the left and right sides of the church to sing it together in the middle.) Nearly all canons have only eight odes, the second ode generally being omitted since its canticle is quite penitential and so used only on the triode of the Tuesdays of Great Lent as well as in a few canons of an archaic style such as the aforementioned Great Canon. Because a canon is composed of nine odes, it can be conveniently divided into three sections. Between Ode III and Ode IV, a sedalen or \\"sitting hymn\\" is sung. Between Ode VI and Ode VII, a vestigal kontakion is sung with only its prooimion, or initial stanza, and the first oikos or strophe. If an akathist is to be chanted in conjunction with a canon, it is inserted after Ode VI. The typical order for a full canon, as currently, in most places, chanted at matins is as follows: *Ode I *Ode III *Little Litany *Kathisma Hymn *Ode IV *Ode V *Ode VI *Little Litany *Kathisma Hymn *(Synaxarion) *Ode VII *Ode VIII *Magnificat *Ode IX *Little Litany *Exapostilarion =Modern arrangement= As detailed above, the Biblical canticles are now rarely used, each ode beginning with the irmos, save for the ninth ode where the Magnificat, which forms half of its canticle, is sung in its entirety before the irmos, except on certain major feasts when that ode has a special structure. Following the irmos, each troparion has a brief refrain, determined by the subject matter of the canon, replacing the verse of canticle. The total number of troparia is determined by local usage. Theoretically, each ode has fourteen (or occasionally sixteen), with some troparia repeated if the service books do not provide enough of them and some conjoined if there are too many. This makes the canon too lengthy for typical parish use, so fewer are sung or in Russian practice, read. Usage Canons are used most notably at Matins, but also at the Midnight Office for Sunday; at Great and Small Compline; and at special services such as the Paraklesis and those of similar structure such as the Panichida and Moleben. In Russian practice for the latter cases the canon is often vestigial, consisting of no more than a selection of katabasia with refrains and doxology. The Greek equivalent of a Moleben is the Paraklesis, during which a full canon is still chanted. Canons may also be used in private prayer either as a regular part of a rule or for special needs. One traditional prayerful preparation for reception of the Eucharist is to read three canons and an akathist the evening prior. When used privately there is generally no attempt at an elaborated musical or metrical performance, and may be read silently. Abbreviated Canons Sometimes abbreviated canons are used. A canon consisting of only four odes is called a tetraode; a canon consisting of only three odes is called a triode. In both of these types of canons, the last two odes are always the VIIIth and IXth. The preceding odes may vary with the day of the week. For instance, during Great Lent, the Lenten Triodion provides triodes at Matins on Monday through Friday: on Mondays they consist of Odes I, VIII and IX, on Tuesdays, Odes II, VIII and IX, and so on through Friday which consists of Odes V, VIII and IX. The Saturdays of Great Lent have tetraodes, consisting of Odes VI, VII, VIII and IX. Because the use of triodes is so prevalent during Great Lent, the book containing the changeable portions of services that liturgical season is called the Triodion. In the Russian Orthodox Church, for arcane historical reasons, the Pentecostarion is called the Flowery Triodion even though it contains no triodes. Triodes and tetraodes are also found during certain Forefeasts and Afterfeasts. Poetic and musical structure The Biblical odes are not identical in meter, and so although all the music is performed in the same mode each ode must comprise an individual composition. However, in the original Greek compositions, the irmos and troparia would by design be of the same meter and so could use the same melody. Acrostics would often be present as well, read down a canon's troparia, and sometimes involving the irmos as well if it was composed at the same time. The meter and acrostic would be given along with the canon's title. This structure is now generally lacking in more recently composed canons, especially when the canons are composed in languages other than Greek to some setting other than Byzantine chant, and since it is now expected that large portions of the canon will be read rather than sung. Although some newer canons also contain acrostics, they are less frequent than they once were. Texts The irmoi and katabasia for various occasions are found gathered together in the Irmologion, one of the standard service books of the Orthodox Church. Complete canons (irmoi with their troparia) are found in the Menaion, Octoechos and Horologion used throughout the year, and in the seasonal service books the Triodion and the Pentecostarion. Various collections of canons can also be found, as well as publications of individual canons in pamphlet form. See also *Kanon Pokajanen References *Brenton, Sir Lancelot C.L. (1986).

Picked for Nottinghamshire to play against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in one of the set-piece season-openers at Lord's in 1914, he took eight wickets for 91 runs in the first innings. He followed that with five for 58 in his first County Championship match. And by the end of his first season he had amassed 115 first-class wickets at an average of 21.80, including 10 instances of five wickets or more in an innings and three of 10 or more in a match. Against Leicestershire at Trent Bridge late in the season, he took eight for 75 in an innings, improving on his debut figures. Barratt then lost the next four years of his cricket career to the First World War and when it resumed in 1919, according to his obituary in Wisden, \\"he was slow in finding his old form\\". He took 58 wickets in the limited 1919 fixtures, 68 in 1920 and 91 in 1921. Though his batting average across these seasons and beyond was low ‚Äì he managed 16 runs per innings in 1919, but did not approach that again until the late 1920s ‚Äì there were individual innings of power and brilliance. Against Sussex in 1919, he made 82 while batting at No 9, with his partners in ninth and tenth wicket partnerships contributing only 11 out of 60 runs. And in 1921 against Hampshire, he made 79 out of a partnership of 129 in 50 minutes for the eighth wicket with Dodger Whysall that led Nottinghamshire to an unlikely victory after they had fallen to 65 for six in search of 286 to win. Middle years Better bowling form returned in 1922, when Barratt took 109 wickets at 16.33 runs each, the best bowling average in a single season in his career. Among the wickets were his career-best innings figures, eight for 26 against what Wisden termed a \\"helpless\\" Glamorgan team: the innings, which totalled just 47, lasted only 75 minutes. He maintained form in 1923, with 101 wickets and made the highest score of his career so far with 92 in \\"a wonderful display of hitting\\" against Leicestershire. The seasons between 1924 and 1927 saw a slight dropping off from Barratt, though he remained an important part of the Nottinghamshire side. In Wisden 1925, he was singled out for consistency. In both 1924 and 1925, he took more than 90 wickets at an average of less than 20 runs per wicket, but in 1926, that fell to just 66 wickets at a cost of 32 runs apiece. The recovery to 75 wickets at 21.14 in 1927 owed something to his fourth return of eight wickets in an innings, eight for 53 against Worcestershire at Trent Bridge. Nor was the batting anything out of the ordinary: he failed to pass 50 in 1924, 1925 or 1926, and reached a highest of only 57 in 1927. All-rounder This fallow period in the mid 1920s made his emergence as a genuine all-rounder in the 1928 season, his benefit year, all the more surprising. In all matches, he took 114 wickets at a cost of 25.18 runs each and, unexpectedly, made 1167 runs at an average of 29.17, not far short of double the average and more than double the aggregate he had achieved in any other season before. Wisden had an explanation for his sudden advance: it attributed it to \\"waiting more patiently than heretofore for the right ball to hit\\". It added that he \\"gave some remarkable displays of high speed scoring which never degenerated into mere slogging\\". The 1928 season saw the only two centuries of Barratt's career. The first, an unbeaten 139 which remained his highest score, came in a high-scoring match on an easy pitch with short boundaries at Coventry, and set some records. Nottinghamshire's total of 656 for three declared was the highest at the time for the loss of only three wickets, and four of the five batsmen used ‚Äì George Gunn, Whysall, Willis Walker and Barratt ‚Äì made hundreds. Barratt, unusually promoted to No 5, and Walker put on 196 in 84 minutes and Barratt's 139 included seven sixes and 18 fours in what Wisden termed \\"a remarkable display of powerful driving\\". The vast total was not a match-winner: Warwickshire batted across the rest of the second day after Nottinghamshire's declaration, and then rain prevented any play on the third and final day, so that there was no decision even on first innings. Less than two weeks later, Barratt made his second century, this time hitting an undefeated 110 in the home match against Glamorgan at Trent Bridge. He reached 50 in 30 minutes and his century in 85, and Wisden said it involved \\"some mighty hitting\\", including five sixes. It was not an innings without blemish: \\"He was missed on eight occasions--five times in the long field.\\" Test cricketer Barratt maintained his 1928 form into the 1929 season, when Nottinghamshire won the County Championship for the first time since 1907. He made 860 runs at an average of 22.05, and twice scored more than 90 without reaching a century. As before his runs came quickly: 94 in 80 minutes against Surrey and 90 in 75 minutes against Middlesex being noted by Wisden. Bowling alongside Harold Larwood and Bill Voce in \\"an attack superior to that of any other county\\", Barratt took, in all matches, 129 wickets at a cost of 21.24 runs each. And when Larwood was injured before the Fourth Test against the South Africans at Old Trafford, Barratt was picked to replace him in a side captained by his county captain, Arthur Carr. He took one wicket in each innings in a match that England won by an innings. He was not picked for the final match of the series, when his place was taken by Nobby Clark of Northamptonshire. In the winter of 1929-30, MCC picked tour parties to visit the newly Test-playing West Indies and New Zealand. Both sides were a mixture of established Test players and other county standard amateurs and professionals, and some \\"star\\" players of the time opted out entirely. Barratt was picked for the tour to New Zealand, with some first-class matches (but not Test matches) being played in Australia as well. He had what Wisden called \\"days of effectiveness with the ball\\". They included two good matches on the Australian leg of the tour, taking nine wickets in the match against South Australia and five in an innings against Victoria. But although he played in all four Tests in New Zealand, he was not successful, taking only three wickets in the series, and never more than one in an innings. And on the tour as a whole, his batting was not up to his recent standards, with no scores of 50 in the 11 first-class matches he played in. The end of the cricket career Back in England in 1930, Barratt had what Wisden called \\"an unsatisfactory season\\". He scored 502 runs with three scores of more than 50, but his tally of wickets fell from 129 in 1929 to just 51, and their cost rose from 21 runs each to more than 31. Wisden cited wet pitches in a wet summer as a cause, but Barratt was also, by this stage, 36 years old. The following season, 1931, underlined the decline. In 21 County Championship matches, Barratt took only 24 wickets at a cost of more than 41 runs each, and he scored only 305 runs in these games at an average of 12.70. There was one last hurrah as a batsman: against Kent, he and Sam Staples put on 82 in half an hour, and in Barratt's innings of 72 there were five sixes. But by his last Championship match in August, in an admittedly strong batting line-up, Barratt was batting at No 11, and failing to take a wicket. At the end of the 1931 season, he retired from first-class cricket.

The e_magic field (a WORD) needs to be set to the value 0x5A4D. ... In ASCII representation, 0x5A4D is MZ, the initials of Mark Zbikowski, one of the original architects of MS-DOS.\\" The MZ DOS executable file is newer than the COM executable format and differs from it. The DOS executable header contains relocation information, which allows multiple segments to be loaded at arbitrary memory addresses, and it supports executables larger than 64k; however, the format still requires relatively low memory limits. These limits were later bypassed using DOS extenders. The environment of an EXE program run by DOS is found in its Program Segment Prefix. EXE files normally have separate segments for the code, data, and stack. Program execution begins at address 0 of the code segment, and the stack pointer register is set to whatever value is contained in the header information (thus if the header specifies a 512 byte stack, the stack pointer is set to 200h). It is possible to not use a separate stack segment and simply use the code segment for the stack if desired. The DS (data segment) register normally contains the same value as the CS (code segment) register and is not loaded with the actual segment address of the data segment when an EXE file is initialized; it is necessary for the programmer to set it themselves, generally done via the following instructions: MOV AX, @DATA MOV DS, AX In the original DOS 1.x API, it was also necessary to have the DS register pointing to the segment with the PSP at program termination; this was done via the following instructions: PUSH DS XOR AX, AX PUSH AX Program termination would then be performed by a RETF instruction, which would retrieve the original segment address with the PSP from the stack and then jump to address 0, which contained an INT 20h instruction. The DOS 2.x API introduced a new program termination function, INT 21h Function 4Ch which does not require saving the PSP segment address at the start of the program, and Microsoft advised against the use of the older DOS 1.x method.  Compatibility  MZ DOS executables can be run from DOS and Windows 9x-based operating systems. 32-bit Windows NT- based operating systems can execute them using their built-in Virtual DOS machine (although some graphics modes are unsupported). 64-bit versions of Windows cannot execute them. Alternative ways to run these executables include DOSBox, DOSEMU, Wine, and Cygwin.

It tells the story of the love affair between an Italian man and an American woman. The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Stazione Termini does not mean \\"terminal station\\", but instead refers to the Termini district. Plot While vacationing in Italy, a married American woman, Mary Forbes (Jennifer Jones), becomes entangled in an affair with Italian academic Giovanni Doria (Montgomery Clift). She decides to break off the affair and goes to Rome's Stazione Termini to leave by train for Paris. As she says goodbye, he tries to make her stay and confesses his love for her. Together they wander the Termini station but ultimately she leaves him behind to go back to her husband. Production The film is based on the story Stazione Termini by Cesare Zavattini. Truman Capote was credited with writing the entire screenplay, but later claimed to have written only two scenes.Patricia Bosworth, Montgomery Clift, p. 244 The film was an international co-production between De Sica's own company and the Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, who commissioned it as a vehicle for his wife, Jennifer Jones. The production of the film was troubled from the very beginning. Carson McCullers was originally chosen to write the screenplay, but Selznick fired her and replaced her with a series of writers, including Paul Gallico, Alberto Moravia and Capote. Disagreements ensued between De Sica and Selznick, and during production, Selznick would write 40- and 50-page letters to his director every day, although De Sica knew no English. After agreeing to everything, De Sica has said, he simply did things his way. Montgomery Clift sided with De Sica in his disputes with Selznick, claiming that Selznick wanted the movie to look like a slick little love story, while De Sica wanted to depict a ruined romance. \\"Love relationships are ludicrous, painful, and gigantically disappointing. This couple loves each other but they become unconnected.\\"P. Bosworth, Montgomery Clift, p. 245 During filming, Jones was distracted and saddened by the recent death of her former husband, actor Robert Walker, and badly missed her two sons, who were at school in Switzerland.P. Bosworth, Montgomery Clift, p. 246 She had been married to Selznick less than two years at that point, and they were having difficulties in the marriage. The original 1953 Italian release of the film ran 89 minutes, but it was later re-edited by Selznick down to 64 minutes. This was too short to qualify it as a feature film, so Selznick hired singer Patti Page, and filmed her singing two Italian-themed songs on a soundstage and attached this unrelated \\"overture\\" footage to the beginning of the film, before the credits, giving it a technical running time of 72 minutes.https://www.criterion.com/films/586-indiscretion-of-an-american-wife Selznick released the film in the United States as Indiscretion of an American Wife (and as Indiscretion in the UK). Clift declared that he hated the picture and denounced it as \\"a big fat failure.\\" Critics of the day agreed, giving it universally bad reviews. The two versions have been released together on DVD by The Criterion Collection. A 1998 remake of the film was made for television under the title Indiscretion of an American Wife.

It is also a nickname most commonly used in English for those with the surname Clark or Clarke. Origins as a nickname A number of possible explanations exist for the use of Nobby as a nickname for people with the surname Clark. These include: * Clerks in the City of London used to wear Nobby hats, a type of bowler hat. Alternative spellings include \\"Knobby\\" and \\"Clarke\\". * 16th century monks wrote letters for the illiterate. These monks were referred to as \\"Clerks\\". The outcome of so much writing causes calluses on the fingers \\"nobs\\" and therefore \\"Nobby Clerks\\" was born. * In England the term \\"nob\\" is used to refer to a member of the aristocracy and by extension a posh person. Clerks were also required to maintain a high standard of dress, and were paid a clothing allowance. The result was that they always appeared smart. A clerk would deal with the common people but would be better educated, better paid and in a position of relative power. To the uneducated, clerks were posh and therefore considered to be \\"nobs\\". Hence, nobby Clark. Both the Oxford English and the English Dialect Dictionaries list nobby as being of a rich man, a nob or toff, or ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, and gives it a wide distribution, so smart persons were \\"nobby\\".

Most of the founders of the churches were associated with Anglicanism, though some Methodists joined the movement as well. The churches oppose traditional African religion, and sometimes burn cult images as idols. They oppose polygamy and witchcraft. In contrast with Kimbanguism, the churches tend to avoid politics and focus instead on the holiness movement.

Early life Educated at the former Ealing Grammar School for Boys (now Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College), Barlow was both a talented cricketer and rugby player in his youth. He has been capped for the England under-23 Rugby Union team. Career A stylish, confident and powerful player, Barlow was an important figure in the powerhouse Middlesex team of the late 1970s and early 1980s under Mike Brearley. He was described as a natural athlete, and his quick running between the wickets, often in partnership with the equally fleet of foot Clive Radley, and later in profitable partnerships with Wilf Slack, was a feature of his play. Barlow won many one-day games for his team. He was an outstanding fieldsman, ranked alongside Derek Randall and the youthful David Gower in the covers. He ran out many batsmen with a fine sense of anticipation, good ground coverage and a fast and accurate arm. He played three Test matches, but was unable to play the major innings, which might have cemented himself in the England team. His debut One Day International saw his best innings, an unbeaten 80 against a strong West Indies side, but he struggled in five more ODIs after that. He made a strong start in the first- class matches of his 1976‚Äì77 tour to India, but could not translate that form into the Test arena, and was dropped after another failure against Australia in 1977. In five Test innings, Barlow never reached double figures, and defensive flaws saw him ultimately overlooked. He continued as a prolific player for Middlesex, often opening the batting, but ironically for such a fit and athletic player his career was ended prematurely by a persistent back injury. He turned to coaching and, in 2001, moved to New Zealand, taking charge of the Central Districts Stags in 2004.Graham Barlow named new coach of Central Districts at ESPN Cricinfo, 14 June 2004 He later resided in Whangarei, teaching.

This plant uses PUREX chemistry (based on tributyl phosphate (TBP)) to extract plutonium and uranium from used nuclear fuel. The plant was originally constructed and operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), but in 1971 control was transferred to British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL). B205 was commissioned in 1964 as a replacement for the UK's first nuclear reprocessing plant, B204, which was converted into a pre-handling plant for B205 and recommissioned in 1969. In 1973, after both plants had been shut down for one year for repairs, a violent reaction in the B204 plant occurred which contaminated the entire plant and 34 workers with ruthenium-106. Following this event the B204 plant was permanently decommissioned. There is evidence that a similar ruthenium oxidation and sublimation reaction may have occurred in 2017 in the Mayak reprocessing facility in southern Russia, however both the facility and the Russian government deny this.Detection of Ruthenium 106 in France and in Europe: Results of IRSN‚Äôs investigationsRadioactive cloud that covered Europe might be from RussiaRussia starts cleaning up Cold War-era nuclear waste 2017. \\"from Andreyeva Bay, the spent fuel will be shipped on board a specially-equipped vessel to Russia's Arctic port of Murmansk, then on to its final destination, the Mayak nuclear reprocessing plant in Chelyabinsk, near the Ural Mountains.\\" Over its lifetime, the B205 plant has handled over 35,000 tons of expended Magnox fuel, and returned over 15,000 tons of uranium to the fuel cycle. Now that the Magnox reactors have been retired from use, the final fuels are being processed, and the B205 plant is slated for decommissioning around 2020 after all fuel has been reprocessed. Process The process uses mixer settlers as the basis of the plant operation. The unit comprises a set of mixing compartments where the solvent and aqueous liquids mix. The mix then passes to an associated settler compartment where the solvent separates from the aqueous and forms 2 separate layers. These then leave the settler compartment to the next mixer compartments. The solvent and aqueous flow in opposite directions through the mixer settler stages (typically 8 or more), controlled by careful design of the transfer ports between the settler stages. The Magnox fuel is dissolved in nitric acid within the Dissolver Cell. The aqueous stream is conditioned to the correct temperature and acidity and then passes to the first mixer settler system where fission products are separated from the uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) by extraction of the U/Pu into the solvent phase comprising tri-butyl- phosphate in odourless kerosene. This has the effect of reducing the radiation levels in subsequent stages of the process and the resulting degradation of the solvents. The solvent stream of U, Pu and remaining fission products then passes to the critical mixer settler stages where the U and Pu are transferred into the aqueous phase and fission products remains in the aqueous phase. Separation of the U and Pu is achieved by adding a reductant, which causes the Pu, but not the U, to transfer into the solvent phase. Once separated, further removal of fission products is undertaken by more mixer settler units. The U and Pu streams are then passed to evaporators to concentrate the U and Pu before further processing in other plants.

A second-generation wrestler whose father and uncle (Mike and Ben Sharpe) also competed in the profession, Sharpe was a mainstay for various territories throughout the United States and became a regular for both the World Wrestling Federation and New Japan Pro Wrestling. After his retirement from in-ring competition he opened a wrestling school in Brick, New Jersey, where he trained wrestlers such as Charlie Haas and Nova.  Professional wrestling career  Sharpe came from a family legacy of wrestling, as his father and uncle were a successful tag team in the 1950s, recognized as champions from San Francisco to Japan. He grew up in California, but moved with his mother back to Canada as a teenager. In high school, he dabbled in boxing and weightlifting before choosing to follow in his father's footsteps. Dewey Robertson trained him for the ring at age 25 and shortly thereafter Sharpe made his mark wrestling for promotions around Canada such as Gene Kiniski's NWA All Star Wrestling. He became a two- time NWA Canadian tag team champion, partnering first with Moose Morowski and later with Salvatore Bellomo, and also won the Pacific Coast Heavyweight Title. His career picked up steam after moving to Louisiana, where he became a fan favorite and won two different Mid-South Wrestling belts - Louisiana champion (two times) and the Mississippi title (also two times) along with a Brass Knucks title in 1979. In January 1983, Sharpe entered the World Wrestling Federation where he would stay until his retirement in 1995. He was a regular of WWF programming throughout the mid-1980s and early 1990s. He was announced and self-proclaimed as \\"Canada's greatest athlete\\" (a nickname taken from Kiniski). In 1984, MacLean's verified Sharpe's claim to the title of being Canada's Greatest Athlete, which he held until 1990) and was further distinguished by his near-constant yelling and grunting throughout his matches, as well as a black brace on his right forearm, supposedly protecting an injury but more widely believed to contain a foreign object. Initially in his WWF career he was managed by Captain Lou Albano and received a sizeable push, regularly defeating jobbers after smashing them with his forearm. This culminated on April 30, 1983, with a match against world heavyweight champion Bob Backlund at the Philadelphia Spectrum, where Sharpe was defeated and would never reach such main event heights again. In fact, Sharpe would never hold a title for the promotion, and was primarily used as a jobber to rising WWF stars in television tapings. While Sharpe's television appearances were always as the role of a jobber, and victories even at house shows were rare, he chalked up quite a few untelevised victories between 1984 and 1988. Sharpe had a few more memorable moments over his WWF career. He appeared on Piper's Pit in 1984, provided the opposition in Ivan Putski's 1987 comeback match at Madison Square Garden, and pinned Boris Zhukov to reach the second round of the 1988 King Of The Ring tournament. And though he wrestled as a heel in the WWF, Sharpe was also the tag team partner of Hulk Hogan during a tour of Japan against stars of New Japan Pro Wrestling in early 1984 (Hogan was a heel in Japan). Sharpe also wrestled in the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis during late 1984 and early 1985, holding their NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship. His last televised match was on June 6, 1995, in a losing tag-team effort with Duane Gill against the Smoking Gunns. After leaving the WWF, Sharpe continued to wrestle. On June 22, 1996, he competed in a match for the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation where he was defeated by Virgil. On December 7, 1996, Sharpe was defeated by Ax. On December 28, 1996, and March 22, 1997, Sharpe lost to Bodyguard For Hire in the final two matches of his career. For some time after his retirement Sharpe had made his living teaching aspiring wrestlers at Mike Sharpe's School of Pro-Wrestling located in Brick, New Jersey and later Asbury Park, New Jersey (the school has since closed). Among the better known of his prot√©g√©s are Mike Bucci, Chris Ford and the Haas Brothers, Charlie and Russ. Sharpe was described in at least three books by former wrestling personalities; Dynamite Kid, Hulk Hogan and Gary Michael Cappetta, and by longtime WWF wrestler-commentator Gorilla Monsoon, as having shown characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder, as evidenced by a preoccupation with cleanliness that caused him to spend hours washing his hands or showering at arenas and meticulously folding and re-folding his clothing. According to Cappetta, Sharpe's behavior earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Clean\\" among his co-workers. At a televised house show in the Boston Garden in March 1986, Monsoon even joked to fellow commentator Lord Alfred Hayes that Sharpe had the first match of the night at a previous Boston show, and was still in the showers when they locked up later that night forcing him to spend the night in the arena. During his WWF career, many commentators also noted that other than his obsessive cleaning, Sharpe was also obsessed with physical fitness and that if he was not in the ring or in the showers, he would be working out. In 2007 he returned to Hamilton to live with his aging mother. That summer while doing a landscaping job he suffered a deep cut to his leg which became infected. He became confined to a wheelchair and ended up living in a basement apartment where he became a recluse. Other health problems developed along the way. Only in 2015 did he allow a videocamera to record him as part of a tribute to Angelo Mosca Sr. Sharpe died on January 17, 2016, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada at the age of 64.\\"Iron Mike Sharpe dead at 67\\", by Greg Oliver, Slam!

His films include The Undying Monster (1942), The Lodger (1944), Hangover Square (1945), The Locket (1946), The Brasher Doubloon (1947), and the 3D horror film, The Mad Magician (1954). Early life Brahm was born Hans Brahm in Hamburg, the son of actor Ludwig Brahm and his wife. His family was involved in theater; his paternal uncle was theatrical impresario Otto Brahm. Career Brahm started his career in the theatre as an actor. After World War I, he traveled and worked among the cities of Vienna, Berlin and Paris, which had the most artistic cultures of the time. He eventually became a director, and was appointed as resident director for acting troupes at the Deutsches Theater and the Lessing Theater, both in Berlin. With the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany in the 1930s, Brahm left the country, first moving to England. After working as a movie production supervisor, he got a chance to direct his first film Broken Blossoms in 1936. It was a remake of the American director D.W. Griffith's 1919 film by the same name. In 1937, Brahm moved to the US,where he began his Hollywood career at Columbia Pictures. He joined an increasing number of European emigres working in the American film studios in this period. Eventually he moved to 20th Century-Fox. He directed the ill-fated Let Us Live, the true story of two men wrongly convicted of murder who were almost executed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. State authorities were embarrassed by this fiasco and put pressure on the studio to cancel the film. The studio completed the film, but kept it to a small budget. In his book, The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929‚Äì1968, American film historian and critic Andrew Sarris states that Brahm \\"hit his stride\\" in the 1930s with \\"mood-drenched melodramas.\\" He suggested that Brahm's work declined after this period. Sarris said that Brahm did not lack work, as he made \\"approximately 150 TV films\\" during the 1950s and 1960s. Among these, he also directed numerous episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone. Brahm's last full-length film was Hot Rods to Hell. Personal life He married an actress named Hanna, who ran off with another actor, leaving him seriously depressed. Secondly, he married actress Dolly Haas. They divorced after coming to the United States, when their careers moved in different directions. She appeared in New York theatre and in 1943 she married again, to Al Hirschfeld, the caricaturist for the New York Times. In the 1950s Brahm married his third wife, Anna. They had two children together. Their grandchildren include Christopher Maltauro, who became a movie producer and assistant director.

The battalion was assigned to the 3rd Marine Division in June 1965 and was later reassigned to the 1st Marine Division in March 1966 to October 1970, the battalion participated in the war in Vietnam, operating from Chu Lai, Da Nang, Dai Loc, and Hoi An. Third Battalion relocated to Camp Pendleton in October 1970 and was assigned to the Fifth Marine Amphibious Brigade. The battalion was reassigned in April 1971 to the First Marine Division, FMF. =The Gulf War and the 1990s= Third Battalion relocated to its current home at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California in February 1990. The battalion participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm in Southwest Asia from August 1990 to March 1991. From December 1992 to April 1993, the battalion was deployed as a Provisional Infantry Battalion to Mogadishu, Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. While in Somalia the battalion was instrumental in coordinating security for the city of Mogadishu with 12 other nations. On January 20, 1993, Pfc. Domingo Arroyo of Hotel Battery was killed in an ambush while on patrol in Mogadishu. He was the first casualty of Operation Restore Hope. =Global War on Terror= Artillerymen with Gun 3, Battery K, 3rd Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment fire-off a round with the newly fielded M777 Lightweight 155-millimeter Howitzer The battalion once again deployed to Southwest Asia from January 2003 to July 2003 to support the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion‚Äôs timely and accurate fires proved to be crucial in allowing I MEF to quickly move deep into Iraqi territory and topple the regime in 21 days of major combat operations. Immediately following the fall of Baghdad, the battalion assumed the mission of a Provisional Infantry Battalion and begun assisting in civil/military duties as well as conducting Security and Stability Operation (SASO) patrols in the capital city, securing hospitals and other vital infrastructure. In November 2003 the battalion again received orders to deploy to Iraq, but this time as a Provisional Military Police Battalion. The battalion quickly transitioned into its new job and deployed from February 2004 to September 2004. The battalion‚Äôs motto of Semper Flexibils, Always Flexible, held true with the battalion participating in missions ranging from convoy escorts, combat patrols, humanitarian assistance, security force training, and controlling a battle space of over 40,000 square kilometers. In May 2005, the battalion became the first unit in the world to field the new M777 Lightweight howitzer. Feedback from the artillerymen of 3/11 led to modifications prior to being issued to other Marine and Army units. Currently, the battalion supports OIF by deploying individual batteries to fulfill the role of artillery support, as well as provisional MP; as well as supporting III MEF in Okinawa, Japan with the Unit Deployment Program by deploying a battery semi-annually. 3/11 deployed to southern Afghanistan in the spring of 2009 as part of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade.

In the style, journalists immerse themselves in a situation and with the people involved. The final product tends to focus on the experience, not the writer. Overview Like Gonzo, immersionism details an individual's experiences from a deeply personal perspective. An individual will choose a situation, and immerse themselves in the events and people involved. Unlike Gonzo, however, it is less focused on the writer's life, and more about the writer's specific experiences. Proponents of immersion journalism claim this research strategy allows authors to describe the internal experience of external events and break away from the limiting pseudo-objectivity of traditional journalism. Examples = Print = Book-length examples of immersion journalism include H.G. Bissinger's Friday Night Lights; John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me; Ted Conover's Rolling Nowhere, Coyotes and Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing; Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America (2001), Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream; (2005), A.J. Jacobs The Year of Living Biblically (2007) and Matthew Thompson's Running with the Blood God (2013) and My Colombian Death (2008). VICE Films champions an immersionist style of reporting, and Vice Magazine published several issues on the topic. = Film = Examples of immersionist film include the documentary Super Size Me and Heavy Metal in Baghdad and Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. = Television and radio = Examples of immersionist programming include the various offerings of media company Vice and segments of US public broadcasting series like Frontline, Planet Money, and This American Life. Notable figures = Elizabeth Jane Cochrane = Elizabeth Jane Cochrane, known by her pseudonym Nellie Bly is seen as a \\"pioneer\\" of immersion journalism.Hemley, R. (2012). A Field Guide for Immersion Writing: Memoir, Journalism, and Travel. Athens: University of Georgia Press. Cochrane made herself the center of the story when she was admitted to a mental asylum undercover to expose the abuse of female inmates at the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island. The series, \\"Ten Days in a Mad-House\\", was published in New York World in 1887. The legitimacy of her tactics as a form of credible journalism has been questioned, as she placed in Time's \\"Top 10 Literary Stunts\\" which describes journalists who have \\"elevated the literary gimmick\\" of immersing themselves in atypical scenarios. = Jon Franklin = Jon Franklin earned a Pulitzer Prize for an article he wrote for the Evening Sun in 1979. PDF The article is also known as Mrs. Kelly's Monster. Franklin followed a woman through her brain surgery. Unexpectedly, the woman died, and he instead focused his piece on the surgeon, Dr. Ducker. The article includes the details of the doctor's emotionally draining career and the suspense of Mrs. Kelly's operation. Criticism Immersion journalism has been criticized for being too subjective and partial to the journalist's opinion. By immersing oneself in the subject for extended periods of time, the credibility of the writer's neutrality weakens. A Washington Post seven-part article which followed Vice President Quayle went under fire for its lack of neutrality. Washington City Paper editor Jack Shafter said the reporters \\"got way, way too close. With this kind of immersion journalism, you lose perspective, you lose sight of the goal, and you become this authorized biographer.\\" Robin Hemley's book A Field Guide for Immersion Writing: Memoir, Journalism, and Travel describes David Shield's book Black Planet which observed white fans' \\"fascination\\" with black basketball players. Shield \\"exaggerated and conflated a few things\\" but was not untruthful. Hemley says that he received scathing reviews, which was a hidden success, since it proved that Shields \\"hit a nerve.\\" Practicality also becomes a central issue opposing immersion journalism.

The brigade was formed in May 1942 and disbanded in September 1943 without seeing combat. History The 3rd Army Tank Brigade was formed on 6 May 1942 to provide armoured support to infantry formations. The brigade headquarters was formed from the previously existing 4th Motor Brigade, although its constituent motor regiments (6th, 7th and 14th) were either disbanded or transferred to the 2nd Motor Brigade. It comprised three regiments which had previously formed part of the 1st Cavalry Division; the 1st Machine Gun Regiment, 2nd Armoured Regiment and 3rd Armoured Regiment. For consistency with similar British units, these regiments were renamed the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Army Tank Battalions respectively. The brigade was equipped with Matilda II infantry tanks which had previously been issued to the 1st Armoured Brigade. The 3rd Army Tank Brigade was also placed under the overall command of the 1st Armoured Division. Upon formation, the headquarters of the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was located at Greta, New South Wales. The 1st and 2nd Army Tank Battalions were stationed in the nearby towns of Dungog and Largs, and the 3rd Army Tank Battalion was in the process of moving from Goulburn, New South Wales to Greta. By July 1942 the brigade was located at Singleton, New South Wales. As part of a restructure of the Army's armoured units, the 1st Army Tank Battalion was transferred from the 3rd Army Tank Brigade to the newly- formed 4th Armoured Brigade in February 1943. This battalion was not replaced, and the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was reorganised as a two battalion brigade. On 16 July 1943 it was decided to convert the 3rd Army Tank Brigade into two independent battalion groups as part of broad reforms to the structure of the Army, through which units not considered likely to see combat were disbanded to free up manpower and other resources. The brigade was gradually disbanded between 6 August and 26 September 1943. Elements of the 3rd Army Tank Brigade's support units were attached to the 2nd and 3rd Army Tank Battalions to form self-sustaining battalion groups. The 2nd Army Tank Battalion was also re-equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks in September 1943. Both of the tank battalion groups were disbanded in March 1944. The 3rd Army Tank Brigade was commanded by Brigadier J.A. Clarebrough throughout its brief history.

It was founded in May 1940 by Dr. Jos√© Antonio Arze and other Bolivian intellectuals. The PIR was sympathetic to the Communist International, but did not become an affiliate to the International. The PIR began to organize the country's miners, but it did so cautiously for fear that strikes would hinder supplies for the Allies during World War II. Except for the pro-Axis Gualberto Villarroel, the PIR generally supported all of Bolivia's war-time presidents to assure the nation remained an Allied power. Because of the party's hesitation to engage in domestic issues, it lost much of its working-class support to the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) and the Revolutionary Workers' Party (POR). In 1950, a section of the PIR membership broke away and founded the Communist Party of Bolivia (PCB). By the 1960s, the PCB had to a large extent replaced the PIR. Following the military coup in 1964, the PIR went underground and disintegrated into warring factions. A reconstituted PIR emerged in the late 1970s as a puppet party of the dictator Hugo Banzer. In 1979, it dissolved into Banzer's new Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN). Sources *Jerry W. Knudson, The Impact of the Catavi Mine Massacre of 1942 on Bolivian Politics and Public Opinion.

These include liberty of the person (Article 5) and prohibition of slavery and forced labour (Article 6). At the national level, legislative measures that exist to prevent human rights violations and abuses can be found in Acts and laws on issues that either have a human rights component or relate to certain groups of society whose rights may be at risk of being violated. Human rights groups are generally critical of the Malaysian government and the Royal Malaysian Police. Preventive detention laws such as the Internal Security Act and the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 allow for detention without trial or charge and as such are a source of concern for human rights organisations like SUARAM.  Legislation  Several Malaysian laws are said to restrict basic human rights. Recent sweeping changes in these laws have been described by the government as human-rights reforms but, according to critics, have actually, in some regards, made restrictions even more stringent. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has defended its strict controls on human rights with the explanation that the nation ‚Äútakes a holistic approach to human rights in that it views all rights as indivisible and interdependent. In Malaysia, the rights of every citizen are protected by legal provisions in the Federal Constitution....But these rights are not absolute and are subject to, among others, public order, morality and security of the country.‚Äù Hence, while claiming to ‚Äúuphold...the universal principles of human rights,‚Äù Malaysia finds it important to ‚Äútake into account the history of the country as well as the religious, social and cultural diversities of its communities. This is to ensure that the respect for social harmony is preserved and protected. The practices of human rights in Malaysia are reflections of a wider Asian value system where welfare and collective well-being of the community are more significant compared to individual rights.‚Äù =Traditional restrictive legislation= There are several strong and sweeping pieces of legislation that have long been used by Malaysia to restrict the human rights of individuals and thus preserve, in its view, social order. In 2008 Amnesty International summed up the state of human rights in Malaysia, in part, by noting that the government had ‚Äútightened control of dissent and curtailed the right to freedom of expression and religion,‚Äù arresting bloggers under the Sedition Act, using the Printing Presses and Publications Act (PPPA) to control the content of newspapers, and arbitrarily arresting several individuals under the Internal Security Act (ISA). In 2012 there were major changes in a number of these laws that were officially described as human-rights reforms but that have been widely criticised either for not going far enough or for, in fact, further restricting human rights. =Internal Security Act= Perhaps the best known of these laws is the Internal Security Act, which was passed in 1960, three years after the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom. Widely viewed as draconian, it permits long-term detention without trial, and over the decades has been used systematically against individuals who have been viewed, for various reasons, as threats to Malaysia's government or to the ‚Äúsocial order.‚Äù =Sedition Act= Another powerful and widely employed piece of legislation, which dates back to 1948, when Malaysia was still a British colony, is the Sedition Act, which criminalises speech or writing that is considered to be seditious. A great many critics and political opponents of the Malaysian regime have been arrested and held under the Sedition Act, the effect of which has been to restrict freedom of expression in Malaysia. =Printing Presses and Publications Act= Passed in 1984, the Printing Presses and Publications Act, which makes it a crime to publish anything without a government license that must be renewed every year by the Home Minister, has been used to silence government critics and to ban various publications for a variety of reasons. As with the Sedition Act, the practical effect of the Printing Presses and Publications Act has been to severely restrict freedom of speech in Malaysia. Meanwhile, in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), press is more free as there is less concern of controversy happening there. =Police Act= The Police Act of 1967 allows the Malaysian police to detain persons without warrants, and has been used especially to restrict the freedom of assembly. Under the Police Act, until recently, police permits were required for gatherings of over four people, other than strikes, =Changes in restrictive laws= On 15 September 2011, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak announced that the ISA would be totally repealed and ‚Äúbe replaced by a new law that incorporates far more judicial oversight and limits the powers of the police to detain suspect for preventive reasons.‚Äù The government also committed itself to the repeal of some of its other best known legal instruments for restricting human rights, including the Sedition Act and Emergency Declarations and Banishment Act. In addition, the government agreed to review several laws, including Section 27 of the Police Act, the Printing Presses and Publications Act and the Official Secrets Act. =Security Offences (Special Measures) Act= In a June 2012 article published in the East-West Centre in Asia Pacific Bulletin and reprinted in the Bangkok Post and on the website of Human Rights Watch, writer Mickey Spiegel noted that in April 2012, the Malaysian parliament had passed the replacement for the ISA, called the Security Offences (Special Measures) 2012 Act (SOSMA). Spiegel complained that SOSMA ‚Äúdoes not go far enough to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of Malaysians.‚Äù In fact, asserted Spiegel, SOSMA is \\"actually more repressive and retrograde\\" than the ISA in some ways, an indication that the government was ‚Äúplaying 'bait and switch' with human rights.‚Äù For example, ‚Äúcoupled with amendments to other laws,‚Äù SOSMA ‚Äútightened restrictions or banned outright activities already under constraint, added limits to previously unrestricted activities, and broadened police apprehension and surveillance powers in new and innovative ways.‚Äù In addition, it ‚Äúfurther erodes citizens‚Äô individual protections, for example by ceding to the police rather than judges the power to intercept communications.‚Äù =Peaceful Assembly Act= The Peaceful Assembly Act (PAA) replaces Section 27 of the Police Act, which required police permits for large gatherings. Under the new act, such permits are not necessary. Instead, organizers must give the police 10 days notice of any planned gathering, after which the police will reply, outlining any restrictions they wish to place on the gathering. The new act forbids street protest, prohibits persons under 15 from taking part in gatherings, prohibits persons under 21 from organising them, and bars them from taking place near schools, mosques, airports, railway stations, and other designated places. Though touted as a reform of Section 27 of the Police Act, the PAA has been severely criticised by the government opponents and by others as more restrictive than the legislation it replaced, with one opposition leader saying that the PAA gives ‚Äúabsolute powers to the police.‚Äù =ASEAN human-rights declaration= In November 2012, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak signed the first human-rights declaration by the ASEAN nations, an action that officially committed the nation ‚Äúto its first foreign convention to promote fair treatment of every individual irrespective of race, religion and political opinion.‚Äù This signing, it was noted, took place at a time when Malaysia had ‚Äúcome under close international scrutiny for its alleged mishandling of several recent human rights issues,‚Äù including crackdowns on two major pro-democracy protests in July 2011 and April 2012. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia expressed its disappointment that the declaration permits ‚Äúrestrictions to be made on grounds wider than what are accepted internationally,‚Äù and pointed especially to General Principle 7, ‚Äúwhich declares on the one hand, that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, recognises on the other, that Member States may take into consideration their political, economic, legal, socio-cultural, and historical backgrounds in the realisation of human rights in their countries.‚Äù Human Rights Commission of Malaysia The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, better known in the country as Suhakam (which is short for Suruhanjaya Hak Asasi Malaysia), is the country's major agency for addressing human-rights issues. Human-rights groups The leading human- rights organisation in Malaysia is Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM). On 17 September 2012, several dozen international human-rights groups issued a joint press release protesting what they described as ‚Äúthe Malaysian government's ongoing harassment‚Äù of SUARAM. Basic rights The constitution forbids discrimination against citizens based on sex, religion, and race, but also accords a \\"special position\\" in article 153 of the constitution, to Bumiputeras, the indigenous peoples of Malaysia that applies both to ethnic Malays and to members of tribes that are indigenous to the states of Sabah and Sarawak in eastern Malaysia. Those who are not members of the ethnic Malay majority are treated according to article 153 of the Malaysian Federal Constitution where special previliges to ethnic Malays and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak are to be provided in education, employment, and other spheres. =Freedom of speech= The freedom of speech in malaysia has been widely disputed upon as many rallies and protests including \\"bersih\\" has been seen to have its members arrested without warrant. On 8 July 2020, the Human Right Watch reported that Malaysian authorities have initiated criminal investigations against people criticizing government. Journalists, civil society activists, and ordinary people have faced police questioning for peaceful speech. On July 30, 2020, Human Rights Watch appealed to the Malaysian authorities for the release of Mohamed Rayhan Kabir, a Bangladeshi migrant worker, who got arrested for his criticism of government policies towards migrants. He was featured in an Al Jazeera documentary that aired on July 3 about the treatment of migrant workers in Malaysia during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. =Freedom of assembly and movement= Although citizens technically enjoy the right to assembly, public gatherings are subject to police approval. The Societies Act requires organisations of seven or more people to register, with the government denying registration to certain groups, including human-rights organisations, and the Universities and University Colleges Act restricts the formation of student groups. While Malaysians generally enjoy freedom to travel within the country and abroad, and to move abroad and move back to Malaysia, residents of peninsula Malaysia require passports or national IDs to enter the states of Sabah and Sarawak, and citizens cannot travel to Israel without official permission. =Freedom of religion= The constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but also describes Islam as the official religion. Among the official public holidays in Malaysia (varying by area) are Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian holy days. Marriages between Muslims and non-Muslims are not recognised; ethnic Malays are considered Muslim by law. Non-Sunni interpretations of Islam are illegal. International Religious Freedom Report for 2011: Malaysia ‚Äì U.S. State Department Islamic courts enforce sharia law in certain areas of responsibility. In practice, non-Muslims face religious discrimination, including the right to own land. Furthermore in several states, apostasy by Muslims is, depending on the state, punishable by imprisonment, detention, lashing or fines. Two states have the death penalty on apostasy, but federal law prevents the implementation of the death penalty for apostasy. Malaysia will also not register interfaith marriages with Muslims. =Political freedoms= Though Malaysia is a multiparty constitutional monarchy, the same party has held power since 1957 and opposition parties do not compete on a level playing ground.However, the party has been voted out of office in the year 2018, ending their 61 year reign. Over the years the prime minister's power has increased and parliament's has declined. The only elected officials are members of state assemblies and of the federal parliament. Since 1969, municipal and other officials have been appointed. Children's rights Malaysians inherit citizenship from their parents. Persons who cannot prove that their parents were married, or whose parents were of different religions, are denied citizenship and considered stateless. Children who lack birth certificates cannot attend public or private schools. Primary education is compulsory, but this requirement is not enforced. Incest and other forms of sexual exploitation of children are common, as is the genital mutilation of girls. While statutory rape is illegal, enforcement is complicated by the fact that sharia law regards menstruating girls as adults. Child prostitutes are often treated not as victims but as delinquents. Many children of illegal immigrants live on the street and work menial jobs, commit crimes, or engage in prostitution. Malaysia is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, but after the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, the government withdrew several but not all of its reservations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and acceded to the two optional protocols to the CRC. Women's rights After the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, the government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2010, although with certain reservations. The punishment for rape in Malaysia is a prison term of up to 30 years, plus caning and a fine; the law against rape is enforced effectively. There are crisis centres at many government hospitals where victims can report acts of rape and domestic abuse, but owing to cultural attitudes and other factors about 90 percent of rape victims remain silent. Domestic abuse cases are often complicated, moreover, by provisions of sharia law that forbid wives to disobey their husbands, including in bed. Medical treatment for women is adequate, including pre- and postpartum care. =Controversial rape laws= Despite effective rape enforcement, however, there is also a complicated issue concerning the way the law limits, much to the detriment of rape victims, what actually constitutes as rape. Under Section 375A of the Penal Code, page 45, rape only happens when a man's penis enters a woman's vagina sans prior consent. The penetration of women via other orifices, and by objects other than the penis, may not be considered as rape, as so was the case in 2011, where a man who had impregnated a 15-year-old girl was released by high court only because he used his finger, prompting public outcry and an ensuing rally. This same section under the Penal Code also allows men to perform intercourse against their spouses without permission. Marital rape is not officially recognized as a crime in Malaysia, but since 2007 the government has outlawed husbands from deliberately hurting their wives for sex. Despite that, it can still be a problem for victims who have not sustained injury. Adding to the issue of marital rape is also the fact that Sharia courts allow the release of rapists who decide to marry their own victims. One case involved a man in his twenties who sexually abused an underaged girl 14 years of age, but was acquitted by the Bornean court for having married her.\\"Is marrying the rapist to the victim the Malaysian way?\\" The Borneo Post, Aug 5 2016. = Sharia courts = Women are discriminated against in sharia courts, especially in family-law matters. Sharia allows men to have multiple wives and favours males in inheritance cases. Non-Muslim women, and Muslim women in four states, enjoy equal parental rights. There is employment discrimination against women. In Kedah State, women performers can appear only before female audiences. = Sexual harassment = Sexual harassment is common, and since 2010 trains on the Malaysian Railway have included pink-coloured women-only cars as a means of cutting down on it. \\"Women only buses aim to halt sex harassment\\", MSNBC, 12/2/2010. There are also women-only buses in Kuala Lumpur since 2010. In 2011, the government launched a women-only taxi service in the greater Kuala Lumpur area. The taxis have women drivers, and operate on an on-call basis. Disabled rights Discrimination against the disabled is legal, but the government promotes the acceptance and employment of such persons. While new government buildings are designed with disabled people in mind, older buildings and public-transportation vehicles are not. A lower excise duty is charged on cars and motorcycles designed for disabled persons. The Ministry of Human Resources is tasked with protecting disabled rights. A Persons with Disabilities Act was passed in 2008 but violators are not penalised. In the wake of the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, Malaysia ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, though with certain reservations. Indigenous people's rights For the most part, indigenous people do not participate in decisions affecting their lives, and their rights are not effectively protected. Under the Aboriginal People's Act, members of indigenous groups do not have land rights, and logging firms encroach on their traditional lands. Although for a long time indigenous persons were often deprived of their lands without due process, this situation has improved in recent years. Malaysia is signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), but has still not ratified ILO Convention 169. The 20-point agreement, or the 20-point memorandum, is a list of 20 points drawn up for North Borneo, proposing terms for its incorporation into the new federation as the State of Sabah, during negotiations prior to the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. Some of the twenty points were incorporated, to varying degrees, into what became the Constitution of Malaysia; others were merely accepted orally, thus not gaining legal status. Point 12: Special position of indigenous races ~ \\"In principle the indigenous races of North Borneo should enjoy special rights analogous to those enjoyed by Malays in Malaya, but the present Malaya formula in this regard is not necessarily applicable in North Borneo\\" Trafficking in persons Malaysia, according to Amnesty International, ‚Äúis a destination and, to a lesser extent, a source and transit country for women and children trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation, and men, women, and children for forced labor....Malaysia improved from Tier 3 to the Tier 2 Watch List for 2008 when it enacted comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation in July 2007.‚Äù As of 2014, Malaysia is listed as a tier 3 country. Official persecution of minorities =Islamist supremacist Bumiputra laws= Islam is the sole official religion of Malaysia. The Constitution of Malaysia declares that Islam is the only religion of the Malay people and that native Malays are required to be Muslims.Sophie Lemiere, apostasy & Islamic Civil society in Malaysia, ISIM Review, Vol. 20, Autumn 2007, pp. 46-47 Conversion from Islam to another religion is against the law, but the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam is actively pursued through institutionalised means and discriminatory laws against non-Muslims. The government actively promotes conversion to Islam in the country.Gill & Gopal, Understanding Indian Religious Practice in Malaysia, J Soc Sci, 25(1-2-3): 135-146 (2010) The discriminatory law requires that any non-Muslims who wish to marry a Muslim must first convert to Islam, or else the marriage is considered illegal and void. While in a non-Muslim family, should one parent decides to become a Muslim, the children (under the legal age of 18) may be forcibly declared as Muslims, even against the children's will or without the consent of the other parent.2011 Report on International Religious Freedom - Malaysia U.S. State Department (2012)Perry Smith (2003), Speak No Evil: Apostasy, Blasphemy, and Heresy in Malaysian Syariah Law, UC Davis Journal Int'l Law & Pol'y, 10, pp. 357-399 =Persecution of Hindus= Human rights of religious and ethnic minorities in Malaysia, including Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Indians and Malaysian Chinese, are systematically, officially and legally violated regularly in an institutionalised manner to induce forced conversions and ethnic cleansing to homogenise society to Islam. People of Indians descent are derogatory called Keling in Malaysia. In many modern cases Keling is used as a derogatory term, it was used in 2005 by Members of Parliament in Malaysia because of misconception about Indian ethnics, which resulted in an uproar accusing the MPs of racism. =Political Islam sharia and Bumiputera laws= There are numerous cases in Malaysian courts relating to official persecution of Hindus. For example, in August 2010, a Malaysian woman named Siti Hasnah Banggarma was denied the right to convert to Hinduism by a Malaysian court. Banggarma, who was born a Hindu, but was forcibly converted to Islam at age 7, desired to reconvert back to Hinduism and appealed to the courts to recognise her reconversion. The appeal was denied.In 2016, an association of eight Hindu NGOs found that about 7,000 Hindus in Malaysia wrongly documented as Muslims. This problem was widespread throughout Peninsular Malaysia and involved mostly practising Hindus from the lower income group who are documented as Muslims.https://m.timesofindia.com/world/rest-of-world/7000-Hindus-in- Malaysia-wrongly-documented-as-Muslims-NGOs/articleshow/51109806.cms =Destruction of Hindu temples= Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.Temple row ‚Äì a dab of sensibility please,malaysiakini.com On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers. The authorities' excuse was that these temples were unlicensed and squatting on government land, while mosques squatting on govt land are not only allowed to remain but tax payers money is used to build mosques and muslim institutes to promote islam and to facilitate coerced conversion to islam through bigoted laws. LGBT rights Both section 377 of the Penal Code as well as several state-level laws criminalise homosexuality and sodomy. Laws forbidding sodomy and unnatural carnal intercourse are occasionally enforced, and there is considerable social prejudice founded in the Islamic view of homosexuality, although the situation in this regard is reportedly improving. Gays are not permitted to appear in the state media, and cannot be depicted in films unless they \\"repent\\" or die. In two speeches given in June and July 2012 to Muslim groups, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak described gays as a \\"deviant culture\\" that had no place in Malaysia. In December of that year Human Rights Watch decried Najib's remarks, saying that his ‚Äúactions against LGBT people are a glaring contradiction to his self-proclaimed profile as a 'global moderate' leader.‚Äù Those actions include shutting down a November 2011 sexual-diversity festival and a government program to train people to ‚Äúconvert gays.‚Äù The Malaysian establishment's view of LGBT rights was reflected in a 12 September 2012, letter to a Malaysian newspaper by the vice-president of the Muslim Lawyers Association of Malaysia, Azril Mohd Amin. Writing about the proposed declaration of human rights by the ASEAN countries, Azril, wrote that: ‚ÄúThere will be attempts by LGBTs, NGOs, and various other activists to include LGBT rights and the right of absolute freedom of religion in the declaration.‚Äù But if such rights were included in the declaration, ‚ÄúMalaysia as a Muslim-majority country would have to reiterate her strong objections; as such a policy clearly contradicts the principles enshrined in the religion of Islam.‚Äù According social recognition to LGBT people ‚Äúwould be confusing and destructive to the development and witness of our own children....Malaysian and those who are against LGBT rights are thereby protecting the human race from the secular fallacy, perpetrated by the United Nations, that human beings may do as they please, within their so-called 'sovereign borders' (as laid down by the European powers). Rights of refugees and asylum seekers Malaysia is not a party to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and it has no provision for the granting of asylum or refugee status or for protecting persons from being returned to countries where their lives are in danger. Nonetheless, Malaysia does co- operate with UNHCR by not deporting registered refugees whose resettlement in other nations is being arranged. Illegal immigrants and asylum seekers are held in immigration detention centres (IDCs). Since 2009, Malaysia has not deported persons carrying UNHCR refugee cards. Refugees may work but are not provided with access to education. Immigration officials used to be accused of trafficking IDC-held refugees to Thailand to be sold into slavery, but no such accusations were made in 2010. According to Amnesty International, officers of RELA (Ikatan Relawan Rakyat), a civilian volunteer force that is empowered to arrest migrants and refugees, ‚Äúoften extort money from migrants and refugees, and sometimes beat them.‚Äù Employee rights Most workers can join unions, but this right is restricted by the Trade Unions Act (TUA) and the Industrial Relations Act (IRA), as well as by other laws limiting the freedom of association. The right to strike is so severely limited that stringent that striking is effectively all but possible. Private-sector workers are allowed to engage in collective bargaining. Malaysia‚Äôs minimum wages policy is decided under the National Wages Consultative Council Act 2011 (Act 732). Forced labour is illegal, but occurs, with many women and children essentially being forced to work in households, and many of them suffering abuse. Children under 14 are not allowed to work but some exceptions are permitted. The Employment Act limits working hours and imposes other restrictions, but they are not enforced strictly. The US Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor indicates that instances of child labour and forced labour have been observed in the electronics and the textile industries as well as in the production of palm oil. Many foreign employees work under unfair and abusive conditions, with employers withholding pay and confiscating passports. There is an Occupational Safety and Health Act, but workers who walk out of dangerous workplaces are subject to dismissal. Rights of persons under arrest Warrantless arrests are not permitted, and suspects may be held without charge for up to three weeks with a magistrate's permission. Suspects are sometimes released and then rearrested, often questioned without being offered legal representation, and occasionally denied family visits. Detention of material witnesses in criminal cases is permitted. Pretrial detention can last several years. Several laws permit the detention of suspects without judicial review or the filing of charges. Under the ISA, police were permitted to arrest and detain for sixty days, without warrant or counsel or judicial review, persons who acted ‚Äúin a manner prejudicial to the national security or economic life of Malaysia.‚Äù The ISA did not permit judicial review of most ISA decisions, and the UN Human Rights Council considered the ISA inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Under SOSMA, ‚Äúinitial police detention is cut to a maximum of 28 days, after which the attorney-general must decide whether to prosecute and on what charges.‚Äù But ‚Äújudicial oversight is notably absent during the first 24 hours of police custody and such absence can be extended to the entire 28-day investigatory period.‚Äù While SOSMA ‚Äúpromised to ease incommunicado detention by mandating immediate notification of next-of-kin and access to a lawyer chosen by the suspect,‚Äù in fact ‚Äúinitial access can be postponed for 48 hours should a higher level police officer consider it prudent; another serious violation of an individual's due process rights.‚Äù The Emergency Ordinance (EO) empowers the home minister to issue an order to detain persons for up to two years to preserve public order or prevent violent crimes. In 2009, 548 persons were held under the EO. Suspected drug traffickers, including those already freed by ordinary court processes, may be arrested and held for 39 days without trial or a detention order, and thereafter held without charge indefinitely, with their detention approved every two years by an advisory board. In 2009, over 1000 persons were detained in this fashion. Under the Restricted Residence Act, the home affairs minister may compel individuals to live in residences other than their homes and to remain within the neighbourhood; such an order can be renewed indefinitely by authorities. In 2009 alone, police killed 108 persons during arrests. Torture as such is not illegal. In the past there were many allegations of abuse in IDCs and of persons detained under the ISA, but the number of such allegations declined considerably in 2010. In 2017 a North Korean citizen named Ri Jong Chol living in Malaysia was arrested as a murder suspect. After his release Ri said to the news that while under arrest he was threatened to admit false accusations and that the police threatened to hurt his wife and two children. Rights of persons on trial The constitution is self-contradictory on the judiciary, on the one hand providing for its independence and on the other hand limiting that independence. Malaysia's constitution provides for a dual justice system, under which secular law and sharia (syariah) law are both recognised, and secular criminal and civil courts coexist with sharia courts. Sharia law applies only to, and sharia courts have jurisdiction over, only Muslims. In some states sharia courts solely or principally adjudicate family and personal law, while in other states they are empowered to pass judgment on criminal matters. Malaysia's secular law is based on English common law. Defendants in serious criminal cases are entitled to government-paid lawyers. Pretrial discovery in criminal cases is limited. Testimony by witnesses is sometimes disallowed. Defendants are not routinely entitled to see evidence held by the government. The right to appeal is sometimes restricted. Due- process rights are sometimes compromised. Women do not enjoy equal treatment in sharia courts, especially in divorce and custody cases. Privacy rights are sometimes infringed upon, with the authorities monitoring e-mails sent to websites and police permitted to search homes, confiscate items, and take people into custody without a warrant. JAKIM officials may enter private premises without a warrant if they believe Muslims are gambling, consuming alcohol, or committing adultery. Messages sent or received by individuals suspected of corruption or terrorism may be intercepted. Under the new SOSMA legislation, the prosecutor at a trial is permitted to keep secret the identity of prosecution witnesses, thus preventing cross examination. SOSMA also revised the rules of evidence, enabling prosecutors to use information without disclosing sources. Rights of inmates Prisoners suffer from overcrowding, poor food, and irregular water supplies. Inmates are allowed visitors. Religious observance is allowed, provided the religion in question is not one of 56 Islamic sects considered ‚Äúdeviant.‚Äù Medical care is poor, with hundreds dying of communicable diseases in IDCs, prisons, and jails from 2001‚Äì2007. NGOs and the media are usually not allowed to monitor conditions in prison. Preventive and investigative detention are permitted. Police are provided with human-rights training. Caning is a common punishment for serious crimes; boys over 10 may be sentenced to what is called a light caning. Caning Under sharia, several dozen offences such as drinking alcohol and being close to a person of the opposite sex are subject to caning. The death penalty is the mandatory punishment for persons found guilty of possessing illegal drugs above certain quantities; in 2010, 114 people were sentenced to hanging. A 6 December 2010 Amnesty International report entitled A Blow to Humanity criticises the increasing use of judicial canings in Malaysia and concludes the punishment \\"subjects thousands of people each year to systematic torture and ill-treatment, leaving them with permanent physical and psychological scars\\". The report describes the abuse: \\"In Malaysian prisons specially trained caning officers tear into victims‚Äô bodies with a metre-long cane swung with both hands at high speed. The cane rips into the victim‚Äôs naked skin, pulps the fatty tissue below, and leaves scars that extend to muscle fibre. The pain is so severe that victims often lose consciousness.\\" Political controversies There have been cases of flagellation in prisons and they were confirmed by the authorities.'Blut'-Video: Malaysia streitet √ºber Pr√ºgelstrafe ‚Äì Politik ‚Äì stern.de On November 2007, two of the largest political rallies since 1998 took place in Kuala Lumpur challenging the government of Abdullah Badawi. The Bersih rally was held on 10 November and the Hindu Rights Action Force (HINDRAF) rally on 25 November. The Bersih rally was organised by a number of non-governmental organisations and opposition political parties to demand electoral reform in Malaysia and about 50,000 people took to the streets. The rally was attended by at least 10,000 protesters, mainly ethnic Indian, demanding equal social and economic rights from the Bumiputras. Tamil politicians in India such as Karunanidhi came out in support of the largely Tamil Indian population by demanding the Indian government take up their matter with their Malaysian counterparts. In a letter dated 10 December 2007, the internal security ministry banned the Malay- language section of a Catholic weekly newspaper, the Catholic Herald due to its use of the word Allah,Company News Story resulting in the Allah Controversy.

Built in the early-14th century by John Cockerham, the Abbot of neighbouring Furness Abbey, it was intended to oversee the trade through the local harbour and to protect against Scottish raids. The castle was built using stones from the local beach, and featured a large keep with surrounding inner and outer baileys. It was used as a base by the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487, but by 1534 it had fallen into ruin and passed into the hands of the Crown. Sea erosion began to cause significant damage to the castle in the early 19th century. In the 1870s the castle's owner, the Duke of Buccleuch, carried out extensive restoration work and erected outworks to protect it against further damage from the sea. In 1920 the castle was given to the town of Barrow-in-Furness and is now in the care of English Heritage. History Piel Castle was built on Piel Island, overlooking the deep water port of Piel Harbour outside of Barrow Haven, now called Barrow-in-Furness.; There may have been an earlier 12th-century fortification on the island, possibly built by the local monks in the reign of King Stephen, but this is uncertain.; ; The castle was built by the John Cockerham, the Abbot of Furness Abbey around 1327, when Edward III gave the abbey a licence to crenellate on the site.; Comprising a keep with an inner and outer bailey, the castle was intended to oversee the trade through the harbour, and to provide defence, as the Abbey had faced raids from Scotland in 1316 and 1322.; ; island, showing the keep (lower right) and the inner and outer baileys Architectural historian Anthony Emery argues that the castle was built in three phases, starting with the central keep, which he believes was intended as a largely unfortified summer residence for the Abbot.; With the increased threat from Scotland and the granting of the licence to crenellate, Emery suggests that the inner bailey wall was then constructed to better defend the keep, followed by the outer bailey wall in a final phase of work. In 1408, the Abbot John Bolton decided that the cost of maintaining the castle was excessive, and attempted to pull down the defences, but was prevented from doing so by Henry IV; this was followed by a period of rebuilding around 1429.; ; ; The castle was used for smuggling by the Abbey, leading to complaints from merchants in English-controlled Calais that they were illegally trafficking wool, which in this period could only legally be sold through the French port.; In 1487 the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel landed on Piel Island.; He sought help from potential local supporters and held court at the castle, before advancing inland and ultimately being defeated at the Battle of Stoke Field. By 1534 the castle had fallen in ruin and was described in a report as \\"sore decayed\\".; In 1537, on the dissolution of the Abbey, it became the property of the Crown, and after 1660, was given to the Duke of Albermarle.; ; By the late 18th century, the island had become used as a base for maritime pilots, and the castle passed into the possession of the Dukes of Buccleuch. In 1811, the poet William Wordsworth visited the area and wrote a poem entitled \\"Peele Castle\\" describing the site. The sea caused significant erosion during this period, and one side of the keep collapsed in the early 19th century. Walter Scott, the Duke of Buccleuch, purchased the rest of the island and carried out an extensive and expensive restoration of the castle between 1877 and 1878, destroying most traces of the medieval occupation of the site in the process.; The restoration involved constructing outworks to prevent further sea erosion, replacing damage to the ashlar stone features of the castle and protecting the tops of the stone walls. In 1919 John Scott decided to sell the island and castle; the local mayor, Alfred Barrow, intervened and the following the year the Duke instead agreed to give the castle and island to the local authorities as a memorial to those who had lost their life in World War I.; The castle passed into the care of central government in 1973, and is now controlled by English Heritage, who operate the site as a tourist attraction. An archaeological survey was commissioned by English Heritage in 1984, carried out by Rachel Newman of Lancaster University; the findings of the survey led to a program of restoration work, completed in 1991. It is protected by law as a grade I listed building. Architecture Plan of Piel Castle; A - outer bailey; B - chapel; C - inner bailey; D - keep The castle is built to an Edwardian concentric design, with a keep in the south-eastern corner, protected by an inner and outer bailey with stone curtain walls extending out to the north- west.; The castle is built using stones from the local beach bonded with a liquid mortar, with the finer stonework, such as the doorways and windows, made from red ashlar sandstone imported from the mainland.; Much of the surrounding island has been eroded by the sea and some of the castle has been lost, with fallen stone fragments still visible on the beach below. The three- storey keep stands on a low mound of clay, similar to that making up the base of the rest of the castle, and is high, by across, reinforced with protruding buttresses, and a tower on the south-eastern corner. The original entrance would have been at ground level, but a gatehouse, by , was then built along on the north side, raising this to the first floor.; A carved female figure can be seen above the entrance arch, which may have been a representation of Salome. The keep had large windows on the first and second floors, although the lower level of these was later blocked up, and was unusually divided into three sections, creating a central hallway on each level.; The eastern side of the keep has collapsed as a consequence of land erosion. Anthony Emery argues that the term \\"keep\\" is inappropriate for the building, which should be seen more as a residential tower house, similar to that at Langley Castle. The inner and outer bailey walls have also been damaged by sea erosion, but they originally formed concentric squares around the keep and were protected by ditches. The outer bailey wall, thick in places, is no longer very substantial, but even when first built it may have been quite weak; it is protected by a moat, up to wide and deep.; ; Both the baileys are protected by towers; the outer bailey towers are each wide. The inner bailey wall is thick, protected by a wide moat.; Its towers were a later addition to the original design, and a gatehouse in the inner bailey wall was also built shortly after the construction of the castle. The fortifications would have been slightly old fashioned for the period. The outer bailey holds a stone building called \\"the chapel,\\" by in size. Its original use is unknown and it appears to have been built late in the castle's history, possibly after it became ruinous. Local legends exist of a tunnel between the castle and Furness Abbey, allegedly used by the monks as escape route from the mainland. No such passageway exists.; See also *Castles in Great Britain and Ireland *List of castles in England *List of English Heritage properties Notes  References  Bibliography    External links *English Heritage site Category:Castles in Cumbria Category:English Heritage sites in Cumbria Category:Furness Category:Barrow-in-Furness Category:Ruins in Cumbria Category:Tourist attractions in Barrow-in-Furness Category:Grade I listed buildings in Cumbria Category:Buildings and structures in Barrow-in-Furness Category:Morecambe Bay ","title":"Piel Castle"},{"id":"3646049","title":"Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"3646054","text":"Headley James Keith (25 October 1927 ‚Äì 17 November 1997) was a South African Test cricketer.

He played when both professional sports were racially segregated as an African-American. Primarily he played left field in baseball's Negro leagues, and point guard for the barnstorming New York Renaissance on the hardwood, where he was also team captain.  Biography  Jenkins was born in New York City where he played basketball for the St. Christopher's Club youth team and then for the first teams that were named \\"Colored Basketball World's Champions\\" by the New York Age in 1917, 1918 and 1919. Next he played for the top team of the early 1920s, Cum Posey's Loendi Big Five based in Pittsburgh, and for the New York Renaissance, the last of the Colored World Champions in 1925. From that season through 1939 he captained the \\"Rens\\", whom the Basketball Hall of Fame inducted collectively in 1963. In the 1939-40 season Fats captained the powerful Chicago Crusaders which included his old Rens teammate David \\"Big Dave\\" DeJernett as well as future Ren BrickTop Wright. The all-black Crusaders were said to be \\"sidestepped\\" from the Chicago World's Pro Tourney that spring, perhaps because Jenkins and Wright had abruptly left the team in a huff over giving sparkplug Agis Bray sufficient playing time, Meanwhile, Jenkins played Negro league baseball more than twenty seasons with numerous teams based in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland; he may be most often associated with the New York Black Yankees, although he managed Brooklyn in 1940.

Christopher Ilitch, one of the Mike & Marian Ilitch's seven children, is CEO and President of Ilitch Holdings and Chairman of Ilitch Charities and also sits on the board of directors or serves as chairman for several Detroit area civic organizations. Marian Ilitch is Chairman of Ilitch Holdings. Background Mike and Marian Ilitch started Little Caesars in 1959. A complementary business, Blue Line Foodservice, was soon started to supply ingredients and other products to the growing restaurant chain. In 1982, Ilitch entered into sports with the purchase of the struggling Red Wings. Ilitch, executing his long-term Detroit business conglomerate plan, also purchased Olympia Stadium Corporation that year. Olympia Stadium operated the Joe Louis and Cobo arenas. The couple purchased and restored the downtown Fox Theatre in 1987. In 1988, they fielded an indoor football team, Detroit Drive, in the Arena Football League. In 1992, he purchased the Detroit Tigers. Purchasing the Tigers led Ilitch to sell the Drive in February 1994 given the leagues' overlapping schedules. In 1996, the Ilitch family purchased the Birmingham movie theater in Birmingham, Michigan . The theater was then renovated into an eight-screen multiplex. History Ilitch Holdings was formed in 1999 to manage their various holdings. Ilitch Holdings formed Uptown Entertainment to own its Birmingham 8 and Palladium 12 theaters. Until 2004, Christopher and Denise Ilitch, children of Mike and Marian, were copresidents of Ilitch Holdings. At that time, Denise grew estranged from both her brother and parents and resigned from the position. On July 1, 2015, Ilitch Holding's Uptown Entertainment sold the Birmingham 8 movie theater to Birmingham Theatre, LLC, whose principal member is Bill Herting, president of Centurion Films. Chris Ilitch, then president and CEO of Ilitch Holdings, was designated as successor to his parents' position, chair and vice chair, in running the companies. At the time Mike was running the sports teams, while Marian was in charge of the casino. Marian owned the casino due to MLB regulations that bar team owners from owning gambling establishments. After the death of Mike in March 2017, Chris took over management of the sports teams per the established succession plan.

The agricultural land, mostly non-irrigated, is used for the cultivation of cereals, grapes, olives and almonds. The town itself hosts a number of light industries: textiles, plastics and construction materials. Tourism during the summer months is also relatively important for the local economy. The FGC railway line R6 from Martorell and Barcelona to Igualada runs through the town, while local roads lead to Capellades and Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia. Notable monuments include the castle of Fontanet. The castle which was restored in 1916 by Ramon de Viala d'Aiguavives, Baron of Almenar is documented in 955 a.c. and now used for private functions. The sister of the Baron of Almenar, Isabel de Viala d'Aiguavives also financed and patroned the modernist church of Ca n'Aguilera which was donated to Barcelona's Bishop by Zaragoza de Viala family in 1921. The architect of Ca N'Aguilera modernist church is Francesc Berenguer i Mestres, who was Antoni Gaudi's disciple and personal friend. Another Piera relevant monument is the church of Santa Maria, with both Gothic and Roman elements.  Subdivisions  The municipality of Piera includes several outlying villages (barris): these are usually distinguished into the older, traditional settlements (barris antics) and the newer urbanisations which have been developed to cope with the expansion of the municipality (barris nous).

It opened as a railway in 1899 and operated until 1968, though the section beyond Browns closed in 1953. It connected with the national rail network in Winton on the Kingston Branch. Construction In 1883, the Forest Hill Tramway was established and a line that ran eight kilometres west of Winton to settlers in the Browns Gap area was constructed. Although the line was not particularly successful, the Hokonui Coal Company extended it in 1886 to serve their coal mining operations near the settlement of Hokonui. The tramway was built to standards far inferior to those of a railway, and the decision to upgrade was made in the 1890s. In 1896, the Makarewa River was bridged, and over the next three years, the old tramway was rebuilt to railway standards and the line was extended to Hedgehope. The line was completed in 1899 and was handed over to the government's Railways Department in time for the grand opening on 17 July 1899. Stations The following stations were located on the Hedgehope Branch (in brackets is the distance from Winton): *Devereux Road (4 km) *Kings (5 km) *Browns (9 km) *Hokonui (14 km) *Springhills Siding (16 km) *Mako (19 km) *Hedgehope (21 km) Operation The line's passenger services barely lasted three decades, with cancellation coming on 9 February 1931. Unlike most branches in Southland, the Hedgehope Branch had significant industrial traffic, mainly coal and agricultural lime, and trains ran five days a week. The line was losing money by 1930, and despite staff cuts, the losses were relatively the same in 1952. As most of the lime traffic came from the stations of Kings and Browns, the section beyond Browns to Hedgehope was accordingly closed on 24 December 1953. Roughly 75,000 tonnes of lime was being railed off the branch annually until 1959, when government incentives for farmers to transport lime via rail were slashed. The line failed to survive the next problem to strike its lime trade. A significant quantity of lime was railed up the Tokanui Branch, but when it closed in early 1966, the Browns Branch saw its traffic almost evaporate. After struggling through the rest of the year and 1967, it was closed on 1 January 1968. The branch today There is very little left of the Hedgehope Branch, with both nature and human development removing most interesting traces. Some of the formation is faintly visible, but only one substantial remnant can be found - the truss bridge across the Makarewa River, converted to allow access to a farm. Otherwise, no goods sheds, loading banks, disused rails, or other railway structures and objects remain. Discernible flat areas are all that is left of the yards that once existed in the termini of Browns and Hedgehope.

Although the project was abandoned parts of its hardware and software infrastructure are still in use today. Origins and history INCIS was an ambitious project with origins dating back to project Serious Incident Computer Application (SICA) in April 1985, and the National Intelligence System (NIS) project in January 1991. The aim of INCIS was to support operational policing in New Zealand by providing improved information, investigation and analysis capabilities. The belief was that ultimately crime prevention strategies would minimise the incidence and effects of crime on the community. The New Zealand Police developed the INCIS Business Case, which was presented to government in July 1993. The project had a large information technology component. Its prime contractor was IBM, who were to deliver technical infrastructure and 3500 desktop computers. Originally the intended desktop was OS/2 but later was revised to use Windows NT. Project Team The INCIS Project Team went through many changes throughout its life. In 1991 the initial team consisted of senior New Zealand Police personnel plus Martyn Carr (Project Manager) and David Cittadini (Technology Architect), then senior consultants with Price Waterhouse New Zealand. This team completed an initial review of INCIS and lead the project through the initial Scoping Study, the Business Case, the Request for Information (RFI), Request for Tender (RFT) and initial Business Plan stages. This team lead the project up to the point before IBM was selected as the prime contractor. During this time Martyn Carr and David Cittadini left Price Waterhouse to form their own technology advisory company, called Sapphire Technology Limited (Sapphire). In August 1994 Sapphire ceased to be engaged by the Police and Martyn Carr ceased to be Project Manager and David Cittadini ceased to be the Technology Architect. This action was taken so that uniformed Police personnel could lead all major aspects of the project; this was seen to be very important by Police senior management. This major change in key Project Team personnel took place before IBM was selected as the Prime Contractor. Sapphire provided a \\"warts and all\\" report detailing a number of significant business and technical risks with the INCIS project and recommended that these must resolved before Police committed to IBM and to the future of the INCIS Project. The Police Sponsor decided that these could be overcome during the project itself and the contract with IBM was duly signed on September 1994. By this time Police Superintendent Tony Crewdson was now Project Manager for the project. From this date onwards the INCIS Project Team continued to evolve and change considerably over the life of the project. High risk project At the time of inception, INCIS was a high risk project. Visits by managerial police staff to other law enforcement agencies, and other independent research over an extensive period, confirmed the view that the technology requirements for INCIS at that time had not been designed or implemented as an integrated system of sufficient standard to meet the needs of police, anywhere in the world. Project cost Excluding internal police costs within the INCIS project, the business case forecast expenditure for Infrastructure, applications and data conversion was NZD$84,860,000. By 31 March 1999, this had increased to NZD$94,710,000. The estimated total cost of the project is NZD$110,000,000. Ministerial inquiry An independent ministerial inquiry into INCIS, conducted by Dr Francis Small for the Minister of Justice, was completed in November 2000. It was commissioned by the government so that experience gained from the project could be published and used for the benefit of government agencies to successfully manage information technology projects in the future. =Relationship with prime contractor (IBM)= The ministerial inquiry communicated to, and invited IBM to meet with the investigative team to supply information in accordance with the inquiry. IBM elected to decline this invitation to meet with the ministerial inquiry. A final draft of the ministerial report was sent to IBM in order to adhere to the laws of natural justice. The following quote is IBM's written response after receiving the final draft report. :Thank you for your letter of 28 July 2000 and the opportunity to respond to the draft report of the Ministerial Inquiry into INCIS. :IBM has consistently taken the view that as the Ministerial Inquiry relates to the relationship between public agencies an active involvement would be inappropriate. Therefore, although IBM believes that a number of the assertions in the draft report which relate to IBM inevitably lack balance, it does not wish to become substantively involved at this stage. IBM therefore declines the opportunity to comment on the contents of the draft report. Future projects To date, the New Zealand government has not funded any software engineering project as large as INCIS. The State Services Commission now monitors any information technology project involving capital investment of seven million dollars or more in any one year as a result of the ministerial inquiry.

Together, these ancestral units were collectively designated as Aircraft Squadron, East Coast Expeditionary Force. =World War II= Prior to the beginning of World War II, Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) was composed of six tactical squadrons which were based at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico, Virginia and Marine Corps Air Station Parris Island, South Carolina. During the summer and fall of 1941 the Group engaged in maneuvers with the 1st Marine Division in the vicinity of Onslow Beach, North Carolina. They departed for the West Coast of the United States in December 1941. Upon arrival, MAG-11 became the Air-Defense Group for the San Diego, California area, based at Camp Kearny. During this interim pre-deployment period, MAG-11 served as the nucleus of four new air groups destined for combat action in the Pacific. MAG-11 embarked for the South Pacific on 15 October 1942 on the SS Lurline (Mumu). They left with no planes and were expected to fly what they found in the Pacific. Squadrons from MAG-11, such as VMSB-132 and VMF-112 landed on Guadalcanal in early November and were among the first to relive the tired original aviators of the Cactus Air Force. Arriving at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides Islands, the group launched offensive actions against enemy strongholds, air power, and shipping in the Solomon Islands. During World War II, MAG-11 participated in combat action in the Solomon Islands, New Britain, Palau, Central Pacific Areas, and the Philippines. At the close of World War II, MAG-11 was based on the island of Peleliu, Palaus Group, where it remained until January 1946. =Korean War= Personnel of MAG-11 at NAS Atsugi, Japan, September 1960. Temporarily assigned to the San Diego area upon its return to the United States, MAG 11 joined the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW) at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina in March 1946 and remained organic to that wing until August 1953, when it relocated from Marine Corps Auxiliary Landing Field Edenton, North Carolina to Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan. In Japan, elements of MAG 11 actively participated in air operations against North Korean and Chinese Communist forces. From August 1958 until January 1959, MAG-11 deployed to Taiwan in support of the Nationalist Chinese air defenses, returning again in 1961 and 1963 in support of maneuvers in that area. =Vietnam= In April 1965, MAG 11 deployed to Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam in support of counter-insurgency operations. Within 69 hours, after its departure from Japan, group element launched the first attack against communist (Viet Cong) forces. The Group's mission in combat was carried out primarily by the F-8 Crusader, the F-4 Phantom II, the A-6 Intruder, and the A-4 Skyhawk. Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 11 (the Marine Corps' oldest squadron) and Marine Air Base Squadron 11 supported MAG 11 and attached aircraft squadrons during this period. During this phase of MAG 11's combat history, the following types of missions were assigned and carried out: close air and direct support; air defense intercept; visual, photographic and electronic reconnaissance; electronic countermeasures; airborne tactical air control; illumination and combat logistical support for air/ground elements of the allied forces. =Post Vietnam= In May 1971, MAG 11 relocated from Vietnam, reporting to the commanding general, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, Santa Ana, Calif. on 10 June 1971. During November 1979, VMFA-323 and VMFA-531 deployed aboard the . This was the first time in Naval Aviation History that the Marine Corps provided all of the fighter support for a Navy carrier and the first time since World War II that two Marine Fighter squadrons were deployed aboard a Pacific Fleet Carrier. In July 1982, MAG 11's fighter squadrons began transitioning from the F-4 Phantom II to the Marine Corps' newest tactical jet, the F/A-18 Hornet. On 24 November 1982, the F-4N officially retired form active duty Marine service when VMFA-531 transferred its last Phantom to the Naval Weapons Center. VMFA-314 took delivery of the first fleet F/A-18A on 15 December 1982. In October 1985, two MAG-11 F/A-18 squadrons, VMFA-314 and VMFA-323, deployed to the Mediterranean aboard the and participated in the 15 April 1986, air strikes against Libya. =Persian Gulf War= MAG-11 aircraft at Sheik Isa Air Base, Bahrain, in 1991. In early August 1990, MAG-11 began providing squadrons to MAG-70 for the Air Combat Element (ACE) of 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (7th MEB) for deployment to the Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield. With the establishment of I MEF and 3rd MAW in theater on 3 September 1990, MAG-11 was transferred from MCAS El Toro to Bahrain and assumed operational control of all USMC F/A-18A/C/D, A-6E, EA-6B, and KC-130F/R/T aircraft in Southwest Asia. Prior to commencement of hostilities, MAG-11 grew to become the largest Marine Fixed Wing Air Group in history with squadrons from all four Marine Aircraft Wings. The order to execute Operation Desert Storm was received and extensive combat operations commenced. Initial strikes were flown deep into Iraq with follow on operations designed to prepare the battlefield for the attack by Marine Ground Forces. When the ground war began, MAG-11 flew over 7,500 combat sorties and 16,400 hours, without loss of life or aircraft. The 13 squadrons expended over 17 million pounds of ordnance during combat operations. =Global War on Terror= During the period of 1 January through 31 March 2003, Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) prepared, deployed, and executed combat operations in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW) and the Iraq War. With the establishment of I MEF and 3rd MAW in theater MAG-11 was transferred from MCAS Miramar to Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait and assumed control of all USMC F/A-18, and C-130 aircraft in Southwest Asia. After the order to fight in the Iraq War was received, MAG-11 aircraft flew extensive combat operations 24 hours a day. MAG-11 aviators flew 120‚Äì130 sorties per day, dropped over 4.2 million pounds of ordnance on targets inside Iraq in support of Marine, Army, and British ground forces and used 250,000 to 300,000 gallons of fuel per day. MAG-11 flew over 4,000 combat sorties and 10,000 flight hours, without loss of life or aircraft. The eight squadrons expended close to four million pounds of ordnance during combat operations.

In 1975 he made a company called Kemco. In 1976 he became the president of Al Rayyan and then resigned in 1987. A year after he left, Al Rayyan got relegated to the second division of Qatari Football. He came back and was successful in getting them promoted and in the same season they won (89-90) they won the league for the 6th time. On February,1,1992 He became the president of the QFA and in that very same year they won their first cup.(Gulf Cup). In 1996 he joined FIFA and then became president of the AFC. On 23 July 2011, Bin Hammam was banned for life from all FIFA and football related activities by an action of the FIFA Ethics Committee.Bin Hammam Banned, The Independent, 24 July 2011, The Independent 24 July 2011 Bin Hammam challenged this sanction in the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the ban was subsequently annulled on 19 July 2012 due to lack of sufficient evidence. However, just 5 months later in December 2012, FIFA handed bin Hammam a second life ban from football after \\"conflicts of interest\\" were identified in his role as president of the AFC. He was the subject of an expos√© published by the British newspaper the Sunday Times in June 2014. The newspaper published leaked email documents which showed that bin Hammam had paid members of other nations' Football Associations in the run up to his FIFA presidential election campaign and prior to the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids decision that took place in December 2010.

A number of regional football squads had rejected the idea of playing there as it could be seen as tantamount to accepting the Israeli right to the West Bank. As well as being the president of the Asian Football Confederation, he was also the chairman of the Fifa Goal Bureau, whose grants provide financial support for member associations across the world. He was also influential in bringing the 2022 FIFA World Cup to his native Qatar. =2011 FIFA presidential election= In an interview with The Guardian, Mohammed bin Hammam stated he might run against the incumbent president Sepp Blatter for the presidency of FIFA which will be decided during the 61st FIFA Congress between 31 May and 1 June 2011. He told the Guardian: \\"People have to try change. Change is good.\\" Bin Hammam said that Blatter was \\"an experienced person, he has made significant contribution to football worldwide but I believe there is a time limit for everything. There is now a time for a new face and a new heir.\\" Bin Hammam had supported Blatter's 1998 and 2002 presidential campaigns but admitted that he had fallen out with Blatter over issues within the FIFA Executive Committee. In August 2010 Bin Hamman had vowed not to run against Blatter saying that \\"I will be backing him to remain in office for a new mandate. He is my very good friend\\". Following the 10 May 2011 meeting of the CFU, the Bahamas Football Association officially reported allegations of attempted bribery at the meeting to Chuck Blazer a FIFA Executive Committee member and General Secretary of CONCACAF. Blazer initiated an official investigation.Bahamian officials alert CONCACAF to bribery allegations, Bahamas B2bB, 31 May 2011 As a result of the investigations preliminary findings, Bin Hammam was charged with offering bribes for votes and appeared before FIFA's ethics committee on 29 May.

On 29 May 2011, FIFA's ethics committee suspended Bin Hammam and Jack Warner temporarily from all football- related activity pending the outcome of a full inquiry into accusations that they offered financial incentives to members of the Caribbean Football Union. Bin Hammam said that he would appeal against the committee's decision to provisionally ban him from football related activity, saying that \\"The way these proceedings have been conducted is not compliant with any principles of justice.\\" He also issued a statement calling for his reinstatement as well as responding to the claims in detail.

The island is the second southernmost island in the Great Barrier Reef chain of islands (with the first [southernmost] being Lady Elliot Island). The Island is named after Lady Lucinda Musgrave, the wife of Sir Anthony Musgrave, a colonial governor of Queensland. Lady Musgrave Island, and the immediate surrounds, is a national park and can be reached by excursion boat from Bundaberg (located approximately 4 hours north of Brisbane) and from the Town of 1770, Queensland (located approximately 5 hours north of Brisbane). The island is part of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area. Lady Musgrave Island is referred to as Wallaginji by local Australian Aboriginal tribes. The name Wallaginji means beautiful reef. Entrance to the lagoon at Lady Musgrave island Geography This island is the only shingle cay situated on the leeward reef flat.ATOLL RESEARCH BULLETIN NO. 195 The island also has beach rock that is exposed along the north eastern and eastern beaches and an outcrop of lithified coral conglomerate, similar to that forming the core of the cay, occurs near the south eastern corner. Vegetation consists of Pisonia grandis, Tournefortia argentea, Casuarina equisetifolia, and Pandanus tectorius. The vegetation is less dense than that of the larger sand cays of the Capricorn Group. A small pond of brackish water is located towards the southern end of the cay. The island is located on the southern end of a large lagoon. From a boating perspective the great thing about Lady Musgrave reef is that you can enter the lagoon via a deep water channel. There has been some conjecture whether the channel into the lagoon is a naturally occurring phenomenon, or was cut into the lagoon by Japanese or Taiwanese fisherman, or as legend has it was widened by guano miners many years ago; it is recorded by 1938 and in 1966 surveys.Steers Detailed notes More convincingly however, the channel is mentioned in William Collin's Life & Adventures of an Essexman: a Queensland pioneer and in a Brisbane newspaper reporting in December 1875 Collin's salvage of the Norseman. It may have been widened by Captain Collin after he had re-floated the Norseman from Lady Musgrave Island reef and repaired damage to its hull; apparently Collin's crew had the vessel 'on the hard' on the sand cay to make these repairs. He may have widened the narrow, naturally-occurring 'gap' in the reef to get the repaired vessel out of the lagoon, under tow and without further mishap. =Tourism= Lady Musgrave Lighthouse Lady Musgrave Island is serviced by two operators offering day trips - Lady Musgrave Experience from Bundaberg and 1770Reef from the Town of 1770. In mid-2020, a pontoon will be launched by Lady Musgrave Experience for the use of day visitors and overnight guests. Lady Musgrave Island is the most intensively used of the camping islands within the Capricorn Bunker group, due to its protected anchorage within a semi-enclosed lagoon and daily transfers. It is recognised that the permitted numbers of visitors on Lady Musgrave Island at this time, have reached (and at times exceeded) an ecologically sustainable level.Capricornia Cays National Park and Capricornia Cays National Park (Scientific) Management Plan, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) A lease for navigation purposes exists on Lady Musgrave Island with a lighthouse was constructed on Lady Musgrave Island in April 1974. The light is controlled and maintained by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority with inspections of the light are undertaken by helicopter, and an area of the lease is set aside for landing purposes. The facility is maintained using an amphibious vehicle launched from a maintenance vessel. Much of this area comes under the Capricornia Cays National Park with current usages including camping, permitted on four cays up to the following limits: * North West Island 150 campers *Lady Musgrave Island 40 campers * Masthead Island 60 campers (30 from October to March) * Tryon Island 30 campers. (Currently closed.) The island has no fresh water supply, so visitors need to bring all fresh drinking water. A composting toilet is available on the island. The area also has many visits by both passing vessels cruising the Queensland coast and day trippers in fast jet catamarans (typically Lady Musgrave Island). The area is also of significances as a fishery particularly for king prawns. History =Discovery= In 1803 Captain Eber Bunker of the whaling ship Albion was the first European to discover the region. He gave his name to the southern group. The southern cays and reefs were first charted between 1819 and 1821 by Lieutenant Phillip Parker King Royal Navy, initially in the and later in the Bathurst. The main charting exercise for all the islands and reefs was carried out in 1843 under the command of Captain Francis Price Blackwood in which was accompanied by the . The naturalist, Professor J. Beete Jukes, was on board the Fly and his published journal provides valuable information on some of the cays. =Guano mining in the 1890s= The mining of guano (bird droppings) occurred on Lady Musgrave Island, Fairfax Islands and North West Island during the 1890s. This was an extension of a more substantial guano mining operation on Lady Elliot Island to the south where guano mining had started in the early 1860s. Some remains of these activities are still evident. Lady Elliot Island was the first to be mined in 1863. They took about one metre off the island. The next to be mined was the next island in the chain, Lady Musgrave Island. Although they knew the name, the guano miners called the place Bunker number 1 ‚Äì Fairfax Islands were known as Bunker number 2\\\\. Fairfax was more heavily mined before the miners moved onto North West Island. An extract from the original miners helps paint the picture of the operations on Lady Musgrave \\"We had a good run across, and pitched camp a short distance above the crown of the beach, the cutter anchoring in the capacious lagoon. This has the important distinction of having a narrow deep-water entrance, enabling small vessels to enter or leave at any time of the tide. Being narrow it is somewhat difficult to locate. A permanent beacon at each end of the channel would be very useful\\" ....... On Lady Musgrave \\"The phosphate-guano deposits proved very meagre. Taking the whale boat we then sailed down to Fairfax Island (Bunker No.2), only: four or five miles distant. Fairfax Island was a difficult place to work, particularly as to the shipping; tide work was necessary and a launch was used for the long tow out to the anchorage. Operations on a minor scale were carried on at Lady Musgrave at the same time, a ketch being employed to lighter cargoes across to the sailing vessels loading at the other island. It was out of the question to use steamers in the trade, the rate of loading being much too low\\".Adventuring in coral seas Ellis, Albert F. (Albert Fuller), 1869‚Äì1951 Sydney Angus and Robertson, 1936 =Tourist resort in the 1930s= A concrete slab is the only remnant of a resort which operated at Lady Musgrave Island during the 1930s. The island had been a hub for a number of pleasure cruises when eventually more extensive construction of tourist facilities occurred in 1938 and 1939 at Lady Musgrave Island, including six cottages and other facilities.letter H.

The ship suffered extensive bottom damage in the incident. There was no loss of life or injury to persons and no pollution of the marine environment attributable to the incident. The ship was refloated with the aid of a tug on 26 March 1985 and anchored off the island until 29 March for divers' inspection of the damage and temporary repairs. The ship then proceeded under its own power at reduced speed to Newcastle, New South Wales for assessment of the damage and, subsequently, permanent repairs. That the grounding was directly caused by the failure of the officer of the watch to control the navigation of the ship over an extended period. The TNT Alltrans is a diesel engined bulk carrier of 35,218 tonnes deadweight, built in 1983. It carries alumina in bulk, The ship is fitted with cargo-handling equipment which enables it to discharge its own cargoes and has been employed continuously since commissioning in the carriage of alumina from Gladstone to Bluff, and from Bunbury, Western Australia to Bell Bay, Tasmania.

The daily (subject to weather) tourist boat from 1770 can resupply campers with prearranged supplies. As the island is well outside the light cone of coastal cities, the stargazing is spectacular, with nightly meteor showers not uncommon. The extreme edges of the coral lagoon should generally be avoided during tidal inflow and outflow, as the pull can be quite strong. There is an old legend involving a legless man and a widow who died there. It is rumoured to be haunted by their ghosts. =Wildlife= Noddy terns There are an enormous number of birds on the island. white-capped noddy terns nest in abundance in the Pisonia trees whilst bridled terns, black-naped terns and silver gulls nest on the ground in more open areas nearer the beach. The carcasses of noddy tern chicks that fall out of nests or adults that become tangled in the sticky Pisonia seeds are quickly devoured by centipedes and the nutrients eventually returned to the soil. From December to May, migratory wedge-tailed shearwaters, colloquially known as 'mutton birds', nest in burrows in the interior of the island and their mournful wails can be heard at night. These birds are readily seen along the forest walk at night and precaution must be taken to not stray from the path as the burrows easily collapse under the weight of a person. From September to March, migratory shorebirds such as ruddy turnstone, grey-tailed tattler, wandering tattler, bar-tailed godwit, Pacific golden plover and lesser sand plover can be seen foraging on the reef flat at low tide. Buff-banded rails, white and grey phases of the eastern reef egret, pied oystercatchers, sooty oystercatchers and Capricorn silvereyes are resident on the island year-round. The island is a nesting place for green and loggerhead turtles, and there is usually a turtle-research representative camping on the island during nesting and hatching times. Small whitetip reef sharks and leopard sharks can often be found hunting in the shallows around the island. These species are not dangerous to humans, and are fascinating to watch. Green and leatherback turtles can be spotted resting on coral bommies, and the coral lagoon is a haven for a multitude of fish and coral species, and a spectacular destination for anyone interested in snorkelling. =Pests= Goats Goats were originally introduced around the end of the 19th century by the early survey vessel mariners and the early guano vessels and whalers (and the guano vessels and whalers tended to be the same vessels) as they left goats in a number of locations, and coconut trees, for they believed that if people got shipwrecked, they had a goat to eat and they had a coconut to provide them with some sort of a liquid.QNPWS, Lady Musgrave Island: visitor information, QNPWS, Brisbane Over a period of time the vegetation suffered and damage was caused on the island from over-grazing by goats, as on many islands in the Great Barrier Reef. In particular, the destruction of vegetation at Lady Musgrave Island has been documented since 1928, when Napier provided the following account: > The undergrowth has been completely eaten away by a flock of goats which > have inhabited the place for years, whereas every other island that we saw > was clad so thickly in its green and tangled robe of grass and weed and low- > hung twisted branches that the crossing of it was a long and hot and > complicated task. [...] All the undergrowth has long since gone; hardly a > weed can be found from one end of the place to the other; every branch has > been denuded of its leaves, and even the bark upon the trees has been gnawed > away to the height of several feetNapier, On the Barrier Reef, pp. 35‚Äì36. This account was corroborated by another, written in 1936 by the Queensland Acting Director of Forests, who stated that at Lady Musgrave and nearby islands the presence of large herds of goats was threatening both the 'scenic charm' of the islands and the native island wildlife; he stated that grazing by goats resulted in the 'destruction of the grass, herbaceous and shrubby vegetation on the islands [and the] diminution of the normal food for land birds and other Australian animals.letter Reference A. H. C., Acting Dir. of Forests to chairman, Land Admin. Board, Brisbane, 18 December Also in 1936, the destruction of vegetation at Lady Musgrave Island and other islands of the Capricorn-Bunker Group was described by NP Ranger G. Geoffrey, who reported the presence of 'about 20 head of goats' at Lady Musgrave Island, herds of goats in the Bunker Group, and about '150 head of goats' at North Fairfax Island, which were reported to be in very poor condition as a result of lack of food and were eating the roots of Pisonia trees to survive.Letter from G. Geoffrey, NP Ranger to Sec., Qld. Forestry Sub-Dept., Brisbane, 6 October 1936. By 1947, the destruction of the island vegetation by goats was still occurring. Mr Marshall, the Queensland Ichthyologist, stated that 'at present the above island has become overrun with goats. They have eaten the island bare of grass and are now destroying trees.' In 1948, an early attempt to eradicate goats from Lady Musgrave Island was made and a NP Ranger reported that all goats on that island were removed and destroyed, although goats were subsequently re-introduced.letter Reference to Forester E. Lister, Bundaberg, 18 October 1948. Further damage was documented at Lady Musgrave Island during the 1960s, including others impact besides the destruction of vegetation. In 1964, although the goat population had declined to around 18 animals, many ticks were found at the island.P. H. Anderson, Bundaberg to Dept. of Forestry, Brisbane, 12 November 1964. While still unsatisfactory because of the destruction of vegetation it was still an improvement since the almost complete destruction of the vegetation, in 1927, by around 200‚Äì300 goats. One reason why the eradication of goats was difficult to accomplish was the deliberate transfer of some animals between islands, as Julie Booth, a naturalist resident on Fairfax Island, reported in 1969. She stated: 'there have been a large number of campers at Lady Musgrave who visited Fairfax [...]. [They] brought two goats over from the other island, which they were going to leave here.'Letter from J. Booth, Fairfax Island to W. Wilkes, 20 May 1969. Goat were eradicated 1974 on Lady Musgrave with approximately 300 removed by hunting.Walker 1991; D.

African guinea fowls African Guinea fowls that were released at Lady Musgrave Island in 1974.letter, Editor, News Mail, Bundaberg, 18 November 1974 These were present in the 1980s but unsure if they are still present on the island. Locusts or other insects Occasional invasions by locusts or other insects blown from the mainland have caused severe defoliation of Pisonia as on Lady Musgrave in 1925. This has occurred on other nearby islands recently.

He became \\"one of the earliest superstars\\" and \\"black baseball's first legitimate home-run slugger\\" (Riley), and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006.  Early life  Santop was born in Tyler, Texas. At age 19 he played for teams in Fort Worth, Texas and Guthrie, Oklahoma before joining the Philadelphia Giants. In 1910, his only full season with Philadelphia, Santop and Dick Redding formed a \\"kid battery\\", catcher and pitcher.(Riley)  Playing career  An amazing .406 lifetime hitter, Santop would often hit long home runs. In 1911, he hit an astonishing .470 and then, three years later, hit .455 for the Lincoln Stars. At this time, he was catching the two players considered the hardest throwing pitchers in the league: Smokey Joe Williams and \\"Cannonball\\" Dick Redding. While playing for the Hilldale Club in 1918, Santop was drafted in July in Class 1-A.\\"Santop, Webster and Tom Williams\\" Evening Public Ledger, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Wednesday, July 17, 1918, Page 11, Column 3 However, one month later, one newspaper reported that doctors at Camp Dix examined him and \\"found he had a broken and badly twisted arm.\\" The report said he had an accident several years before and that \\"It made it impossible to handle a gun or salute properly.\\" It went on to say he was discharged as physically unfit for service.\\"Noted Athletes at Dix are Rejected\\" The Sun, New York, New York, Sunday, August 11, 1918, Page 9, Column 1 Historians have said Santop served in the Navy. (reference needed) After the war, he was the league's biggest drawing card and received $500 a month, one of the highest salaries paid, playing for the Hilldale Daisies. Hilldale won pennants from 1923 to 1925, but an error in the 1924 Colored World Series basically ended Santop's career. With Hilldale leading a game 2‚Äì1 in the bottom of the ninth with one out and the winning runs on base, Santop dropped a popup off the bat of Monarchs catcher Frank Duncan that would have been the second out. On the next pitch, Duncan delivered the game-winning hit. In addition to the embarrassment, Santop was berated by his manager, Frank Warfield, in a public, profanity-filled tirade. The following year, Biz Mackey took over as starting catcher, and Santop was released by the team the next season. He also managed for some time.  Legacy  The , 240-pound Santop was noted for his outlandishness and his confidence while playing. He was reported to have called home runs while in the batter's box. In a 1912 game, he was credited with a tape-measure 500-foot bomb ‚Äì a remarkable feat in the dead-ball era. In another game, Santop was the recipient of a knockdown pitch from ex-New York Giant Jeff Tesreau in an exhibition game. Both Tyler, Texas natives, Santop yelled to Tesreau, \\"You wouldn't throw at a hometown boy, would you?\\" The gentle giant could, however, become perturbed if provoked. On another occasion, he broke three of Oscar Charleston's ribs in an altercation. While fairly accurate, almost none of Santop's seasons were fully documented, with the exception of 1924, while he was playing for Hilldale and batted .389. In 14 exhibition games against white major leaguers, he hit .296. Santop was a match for Josh Gibson. Gibson was often called \\"The Black Babe Ruth\\", but he wasn't the first to bear that title. It was a Santop original. When Ruth and Santop faced each other in 1920, Ruth went 0‚Äì4, while Santop had 3 hits in 4 at-bats. He was rated by Rollo Wilson, described as the Grantland Rice of black sports writers, as the first-string catcher on his all-time black baseball team.  Post-playing career and death  Santop became a broadcaster and eventually a bartender in Philadelphia after retiring from the game, before falling ill and eventually dying in a Philadelphia naval hospital in 1942, at age 52.

Conversely, geophysical global cooling was the hypothesis that various features could be explained by Earth contracting. Although it was suggested historically, since the recognition of plate tectonics in the 1970s, scientific consensus has rejected any significant expansion or contraction of Earth. Different forms of the hypothesis =Expansion with constant mass= In 1834, during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, Charles Darwin investigated stepped plains featuring raised beaches in Patagonia which indicated to him that a huge area of South America had been \\"uplifted to its present height by a succession of elevations which acted over the whole of this space with nearly an equal force.\\" While his mentor Charles Lyell had suggested forces acting near the crust on smaller areas, Darwin hypothesized that uplift at this continental scale required \\"the gradual expansion of some central mass\\" [of the earth] \\"acting by intervals on the outer crust\\" with the \\"elevations being concentric with form of globe (or certainly nearly so)\\". In 1835 he extended this concept to include the Andes as part of a curved enlargement of the earth's crust due to \\"the action of one connected force\\". Not long afterwards, he moved on from this idea and proposed that as mountains rose, the ocean floor subsided, explaining the formation of coral reefs., pp. 178, 184, 189, also Darwin, C. R. Geological diary: Elevation of Patagonia. (5.1834) CUL-DAR34.40-60 Transcribed by Kees Rookmaaker (Darwin Online), pp. 58‚Äì59. In 1889 and 1909 Roberto Mantovani published a hypothesis of Earth expansion and continental drift. He assumed that a closed continent covered the entire surface of a smaller Earth. Thermal expansion led to volcanic activity, which broke the land mass into smaller continents. These continents drifted away from each other because of further expansion at the rip-zones, where oceans currently lie. Although Alfred Wegener noticed some similarities to his own hypothesis of continental drift, he did not mention Earth expansion as the cause of drift in Mantovani's hypothesis. See Online version in German. A compromise between Earth-expansion and Earth-contraction is the \\"theory of thermal cycles\\" by Irish physicist John Joly. He assumed that heat flow from radioactive decay inside Earth surpasses the cooling of Earth's exterior. Together with British geologist Arthur Holmes, Joly proposed a hypothesis in which Earth loses its heat by cyclic periods of expansion. In their hypothesis, expansion led to cracks and joints in Earth's interior, that could fill with magma. This was followed by a cooling phase, where the magma would freeze and become solid rock again, causing Earth to shrink. =Mass addition= In 1888 Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky suggested that some sort of aether is absorbed within Earth and transformed into new chemical elements, forcing the celestial bodies to expand. This was connected with his mechanical explanation of gravitation. Also the theses of Ott Christoph Hilgenberg (1933, 1974) and Nikola Tesla (1935) were based on absorption and transformation of aether-energy into normal matter. Samuel Warren Carey After initially supporting continental drift, the late Australian geologist S. Warren Carey advocated expansion from the 1950s (before the development of plate tectonics provided the generally accepted explanation of the movement of continents) to his death, demonstrating that subduction and other events could not balance the sea-floor spreading at oceanic ridges, and piling yet unresolved paradoxes that continue to plague plate tectonics. Starting in 1956, he proposed some sort of mass increase in the planets and said that a final solution to the problem is only possible in a cosmological perspective in connection with the expansion of the universe. Bruce Heezen initially interpreted his work on the mid-Atlantic ridge as supporting S. Warren Carey's Expanding Earth Theory, but later withdrew his support, finally convinced by the data and analysis of his assistant, Marie Tharp.Oreskes, Naomi, 2003, Plate Tectonics: An Insider's History of the Modern Theory of the Earth, Westview Press, p. 23, Frankel, Henry, The Continental Drift Debate, Ch. 7 in Scientific controversies, p. 226, 1987, Cambridge University Press, The remaining proponents after the 1970s, like the Australian geologist James Maxlow, are mainly inspired by Carey's ideas. To date no scientific mechanism of action has been proposed for this addition of new mass. This is a big obstacle for acceptance of the theory by other geologists. It is a well known fact that the earth is constantly acquiring mass through accumulation of rocks and dust from space, as are all other planetary bodies in our system. According to NASA, \\"Every day about 100 tons of meteoroids -- fragments of dust and gravel and sometimes even big rocks ‚Äì enter the Earth's atmosphere.\\" The majority of this debris burns up in the atmosphere and lands as dust. Such accretion, however, is only a minuscule fraction of the mass increase required by the growing earth hypothesis. =Decrease of the gravitational constant= Paul Dirac suggested in 1938 that the universal gravitational constant had decreased in the billions of years of its existence. This led German physicist Pascual Jordan to a modification of general relativity and to propose in 1964 that all planets slowly expand. Contrary to most of the other explanations this one was at least within the framework of physics considered as a viable hypothesis. Measurements of a possible variation of the gravitational constant showed an upper limit for a relative change of per year, excluding Jordan's idea. =Formation from a gas giant= According to the hypothesis of J. Marvin Herndon (2005, 2013) the Earth originated in its protoplanetary stage from a Jupiter-like gas giant. During development phases of the young Sun, which resembled to those of a T Tauri star, the dense atmosphere of the gas giant was stripped off by infrared eruptions from the sun. The remnant was a rocky planet. Due to the loss of pressure from its atmosphere would have begun a progressive decompression. Herndon regards the energy released due to the lack of compression as a primary energy source for geotectonic activity, to which some energy from radioactive decomposition processes was added. He calls the resulting changes in the course of Earth's history by the name of his theory Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics. He considered the seafloor spreading at divergent plate boundaries as an effect of it. In his opinion mantle convection used as concept in the theory of plate tectonics is physically impossible. His theory includes the effect of solar wind (geomagnetic storms) as cause for the reversals of the Earth magnetic field. The question of mass increase is not addressed. Main arguments against Earth expansion  The hypothesis had never developed a plausible and verifiable mechanism of action. During the 1960s, the theory of plate tectonics‚Äîinitially based on the assumption that Earth's size remains constant, and relating the subduction zones to burying of lithosphere at a scale comparable to seafloor spreading‚Äîbecame the accepted explanation in the Earth Sciences. The scientific community finds that significant evidence contradicts the Expanding Earth theory, and that evidence used in support of it is better explained by plate tectonics: *Measurements with modern high-precision geodetic techniques and modeling of the measurements by the horizontal motions of independent rigid plates at the surface of a globe of free radius, were proposed as evidence that Earth is not currently increasing in size to within a measurement accuracy of 0.2 mm per year. The lead author of the study stated \\"Our study provides an independent confirmation that the solid Earth is not getting larger at present, within current measurement uncertainties\\".It's a Small World, After All: Earth Is Not Expanding, NASA Research Confirms, ScienceDaily (Aug. 17, 2011) * The motions of tectonic plates and subduction zones measured by a large range of geological, geodetic and geophysical techniques supports plate tectonics.Fowler (1990), pp 281 & 320‚Äì327; Duff (1993), pp 609‚Äì613; Stanley (1999), pp 223‚Äì226 * Imaging of lithosphere fragments within the mantle supports lithosphere consumption by subduction. *Paleomagnetic data has been used to calculate that the radius of Earth 400 million years ago was 102 ¬± 2.8 percent of today's radius.

There are rare cases of single-character abbreviations for multiple-character words or phrases, such as for toshokan, \\"library\\", but this is very unusual; see polysyllabic Chinese characters for this phenomenon in Chinese, where it is more common.  Examples  Some widely used ryakuji = Notes = Of these, several are commonly seen in signs: are very commonly seen, particularly simplifying in store signs, while and are also relatively common, as is for (as in ). Other characters are less commonly seen in public, instead being primarily found in private writing. * ‚Äì These are perhaps the most commonly used Ryakuji. 1 (dai, ordinal prefix) is present in Unicode as U+3427 (), but is not supported by the MS Gothic or Mincho family of typefaces, or Arial Unicode MS. According to the original Japanese article, 1 has been seen on roadsigns on the Keihin #3 Road (, 16px, Dai-San Keihin D≈çro). 2 is present in Unicode as U+95E8; it is unified with the closely related Simplified Chinese abbreviation (both originated from cursive script forms). The Japanese form may be explicitly induced with the sequence U+95E8 U+E0100. * ‚Äì An abbreviation of the bottom four dots in the character is present in Unicode as U+594C, but is not supported by the MS Gothic or MS Mincho typefaces. It does appear in Arial Unicode, Sim Sun, Sim Hei, MingLiU, KaiU and New Gulim typefaces. Another simplification of this sort can be seen for the bottom four dots of (present in Unicode as U+29D4B). The bottom of the characters and , however, are simplified instead using a horizontal line, as in the Simplified Chinese characters and . * (variant 1 is present in Unicode as U+803A; variant 2 is U+2B7C9) ‚Äì Also used often, but somehow not applied to the related characters and . * 16px (, from ) (present in Unicode as U+2B782) ‚Äì Also often written as (originally a different character), but the dot (as in ) is used to distinguish. Common abbreviation in stores for days of week. The phonetic is generally not abbreviated to Áéâ in other character such as , , , , , or . * ‚Äì Grass script form (1 and 2 also originated from grass script forms) * (present in Unicode as U+3430) ‚Äì Abbreviated by removing the contents of the kunigamae radical. There is also the (U+56D7) abbreviation for . * (not present in Unicode) ‚Äì A portion at the top consisting of two or more consecutive characters is changed to a shape. This can be seen in the Shinjitai simplifications . The top radical has also been used (although rarely). A colloquial simplification for exists (not present in Unicode) in which the right portion is replaced by Katakana (ki) to indicate the on reading. * (present in Unicode as U+6CAA) ‚Äì Not as common a character, but a major ryakuji in scientific circles, as it is used in such words as (roka, percolation). This character has also been seen in print. The component , pronounced RO just like , is commonly simplified to as well such as in and the Shinjitai simplification . * to or simply (in Unicode at U+9597). The complicated character (t≈ç) is replaced by a simpler character of the same On reading, . This is formally known as kakikae, if one standard character is replaced by another standard character of the same reading, though hybrids such as are ryakuji. Another example of kakikae is (nenrei 43 sai \\"age 43 years\\"), and simplifications of this method have also been seen in print. * (present in Unicode as U+20BEE) ‚Äì Also commonly seen. The bottom portion of is merged. Examples have also been seen in characters such as (the Ky≈´jitai of ) in which the portion has been merged. * (not present in Unicode) ‚Äì A colloquial simplification in which Katakana (ma) is used to indicate the on reading of both characters (ma). The simplification is seen in manga, and the simplification for is commonly seen when writing place names such as Tama, Tokyo ().  Further examples  Omitting components is a general principle, and the resulting character is often not a standard character, as in . If the resulting character is a standard character with the same reading (common if keeping the phonetic), this is properly kakikae instead, but if it is simply a graphic simplification (with a different reading) or the resulting character is not standard, this is ryakuji. One of the most common examples is for haba \\"width\\". Often the result would be ambiguous in isolation, but is understandable from context. This is particularly common in familiar compounds, such as in the following examples: * in * in * in In some cases, a component has been simplified when part of other characters, but has not been simplified in isolation, or has been simplified in some characters but not others. In that case, simplifying it in isolation can be used as common ryakuji. For example, is used in isolation, but in compounds has been simplified to , such as to . Using in isolation, such as when writing shin- sotsu \\"newly graduated\\" as , is unofficial ryakuji. As another example, has been simplified to in some characters, such as to , but only to in isolation or other characters. Thus simplifying the in (bottom part ) to is found in ryakuji. More unusual examples come from calligraphic abbreviations, or more formally from printed forms of calligraphic forms: a standard character is first written in a calligraphic (, grass script) form, then this is converted back to print script () in a simplified form. This is the same principle as graphical simplifications such as , and of various simplifications above, such as . A conspicuous informal example is (3 copies of the character for 7: ), which is rather frequently seen on store signs. Other examples include ; and replacing the center of with two , as in the bottom of . has various such simplifications. In Niigata (), the second character is rare and complex, and is thus simplified as . =Derived characters= Derived characters accordingly also have derived ryakuji, as in these characters derived from : File:Japanese abbreviation kanji mon.png File:Japanese ryakuji KAN.png File:Japanese abbreviation kanji kai.png Similarly, the simplification is often used in fish compounds, such as sushi, particularly in signs. =Phonetic simplifications= Some ryakuji are simplified phono-semantic characters, retaining a radical as semantic and replacing the rest of the character with a katakana phonetic for the on reading, e.g., (20 strokes) may be simplified as (semantic) + (phonetic gi for on reading): Image:RYAKUJI_ki_01.png ki File:Ryakuji GI.png gi File:RYAKUJI ma.png ma Another example is s≈ç, replacing the by so. This may also be done using Latin characters; for example, the character (as used in kenp≈ç, \\"constitution\\") may be simplified to \\"\\": the radical placed over the letter K; this is particularly common in law school. Similarly, (Kei≈ç) as in Keio University may be simplified to \\"\\": the letters K and O respectively placed inside the radical . In this case the pronunciation of \\"\\" (as an initialism) sounds like the actual name \\"Kei≈ç\\", hence the use. The character has a number of ryakuji, as it is a commonly used character with many strokes (16 strokes); in addition to the above phono-semantic simplification, it also has a number of purely graphical simplifications: Image:RYAKUJI_ki_01.png Image:RYAKUJI_ki_02.png Image:RYAKUJI_ki_03.png Image:RYAKUJI_ki_04.png See also * , shime, simplification of (as shime) * , small ke, simplification of * Kana ligature * Shinjitai * Simplified Chinese character * Variant Chinese character * Yakja, Korean simplifications References * Spahn and Hadamitzky, The Kanji Dictionary, External links * More examples of Ryakuji * Even more examples of Ryakuji Category:Kanji Category:Japanese writing system terms Category:Japanese writing system ","title":"Ryakuji"},{"id":"3646211","text":"The Wireless Router Application Platform (WRAP) is a format of single board computer defined by Swiss company PC Engines.

In one of the fulling mills with 15 workers, Nikolaus Wahl brought the world's first automatic feltmaking machine into service in 1904. At the beginning of the 21st century, only a few mills bear witness to that time, and some have been converted to houses: Obere Fallersm√ºhle, Untere Fallersm√ºhle (rolling mill), Sch√§fereim√ºhle, Lohm√ºhle, Nassm√ºhle. Since the millers often backed the water up too high, there were time and again floods. In particular, the Nassm√ºhle (literally, ‚ÄúWet Mill‚Äù) came to grief one day in the late 16th century when local farmers, angered at having their harvest wiped out by flooding, stormed the mill on 2 June 1573 and destroyed it.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 290‚Äì291. History =Origins of the clan= The surname Nesbitt is derived from the barony and lands near Edrom in Berwickshire. The lands are likely to have been named after a geographical feature such as a nose-shaped hill or nose-shaped bend. In clan circles the name is best known through the work of Alexander Nisbet (1657‚Äì1725), who was one of the greatest authorities on Scottish heraldry. Alexander Nisbet established his connection to the chiefly line of the clan and he is regarded as authoritative on the pedigree of his own family. He stated that the lands of Nesbit were of ancient denomination for, in the reign of King Edgar, son of Malcolm Canmore, in whose reign surnames came first to be hereditary, they were donated to the monks of Dunfermline to pray for the soul of his father, and for the health of his own. The historian George Fraser Black listed William de Nesbite as a witness to a charter by Patrick, Earl of Dunbar to Coldingham Priory in about 1160. From 1219 to 1240 Thomas Nisbet was Prior of Coldingham. =Wars of Scottish Independence= In 1296 Philip de Nesbit appears on the Ragman Rolls submitting to Edward I of England. Also appearing on the rolls are James, John and Adam Nisbet. It is likely that Adam was the Nisbet of that Ilk who received a charter from Robert the Bruce for the land of Knocklies with the feudal obligation of providing one knight for the king's army. Adam or possibly his son of the same name continued in royal favour, distinguishing himself in defending the Scottish Borders in the service of David II of Scotland. =15th and 16th centuries= Adam was succeeded by Philip Nisbet, who appears in important charters of the Earls of Dunbar. Philip was succeeded by his son Adam. Adam's great-grandson was another Philip Nisbet who married a daughter of Haldane of Gleneagles and their heir was Alexander Nesbit. =17th century and Civil War= Alexander Nesbit was a royalist who was devoted to Charles I of England. Nesbit was appointed sheriff of Berwickshire, however when the king's policies led to military confrontation with his Scottish and English subjects, Nesbit and his sons joined the king's standard at Oxford. Nesbit's eldest son, Philip, was abroad when the civil war broke out but when he returned he was knighted and given command of a regiment. Philip Nesbit was lieutenant governor of Newark-on-Trent during the Siege of Newark that was carried out by General David Leslie, Lord Newark. When Nesbit left Newark he became an officer for James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Montrose was surprised by a strong force of Covenanter cavalry at the Battle of Philiphaugh where Philip Nesbit was captured. He was then executed at Glasgow on 28 October 1646. Two of Philip's brothers, Alexander and Robert, were also killed during the Scottish Civil War. The youngest brother, Adam, survived and he was the father of the heraldic writer, Alexander Nisbet. =18th and 19th centuries= Nisbet memorial Alexander Nisbet initially trained as a lawyer but soon acquired a passion for history and heraldry. In 1702 he published his first work, an essay on cadency. His great work was System of Heraldry which was published in 1722 with more editions following in 1742, 1804 and 1816. Nisbet died in 1725. Clan branches Related branches of the Nisbet family became established at Dean in Edinburgh, Dirleton in East Lothian, Greenholm in Ayrshire, and Carfin and Cairnhill in Renfrewshire. In the 17th century, many Nisbets went to Ireland and, often via Ireland, to North America. Clan tartan According to the Scottish Tartans Society the Nesbett tartan is identical to the Mackintosh, and similar to the Dunbar sett, which both appear in the Vestiarium Scoticum. There is however no historical link between the Nisbetts and Clan Mackintosh to explain why the tartan is based upon that Mackintoshes.; see also: The Vestiarium was a Victorian era forgery, first published in 1842 by the Sobieski Stuarts. Even though it has since been proven forgery, the Vestiarium is still the basis of many of today's clan tartans. Clan chief The clan was chiefless for four centuries following the loss of the Nesbitt lands during the Civil War. In 1994 the Lord Lyon recognised Robert Anthony Ellis Nesbitt as Chief of the Name and Arms of Nesbitt (or Nisbet). After his death in 2000, his son Mark Nesbitt (born 1961) became Chief.

The British Isles branch was founded in 1983, the North American branch in 1985, and the Australian branch in 1986. Each branch also serves neighbouring regions, and all three work closely together. Total membership is 400+ families. Each branch organises gatherings, those in the British Isles usually held in locations with historic family associations; those in North America in association with one of the well-known Highland Games. Membership is open to all, whether descended from or related to N/Ns, or interested in the family. Notes The name ‚ÄúNesbit‚Äù is not related in any way to those with the spelling of Nesbitt, Nesbett, Nisbet or any other such spelling. Nor does it fall under this clan or their septs. We can trace our family name ‚ÄòNesbit‚Äô, with only one spelling, in a single churchyard going back to the early 15th century.

It takes its name from Mount Darwin in the West Coast Range, where it was first reported, and later gave its name to Darwin Crater, a probable impact crater, and the inferred source of the glass. Occurrence Fragments of Darwin glass are found scattered over a 410 km¬≤ (160 miles squared) area. Such an area is called a strewn field. On slopes and flat ground between 250 and 500 m elevation, the glass occurs with quartzite fragments buried under peat and soil. The peat is normally around 20 cm thick, and the quartzite fragment horizon is typically 30 cm thick. On mountain peaks higher than 500 m, the bedrock is directly exposed to the air, and Darwin glass occurs occasionally on the surface. In valleys below 220 m the Darwin glass is buried below peat and sediments. The glass occurs north, west and south from the crater. Its distribution extends to Kelly Basin and the lower northeast shore of Macquarie Harbour. Northwards it extends almost to the Lyell Highway and Crotty Dam. Darwin glass is rare in the crater itself. In controlled excavations of gravel deposits the abundance of Darwin glass was found to vary from 0.3 to 47 kg/m¬≥. The highest abundance was found about 2 km from the crater, with the average abundance estimated at 3.4 kg/m¬≥ of gravel over a 50 km¬≤ study area near the crater. From this it can be estimated that about 25000 tons of Darwin glass, or about 10000 m¬≥, occurs in this 50 km¬≤ area. The amount of glass is large compared with the size of the crater. Preservation is helped by acid ground water which does not dissolve the glass, but this alone cannot explain the glass abundance. There is so much glass present that the glass must have been more copiously produced than in other meteorite impacts of similar size. Distribution and Abundance of Darwin Impact Glass. KT Howard and PW Haines Nature The glass is light to dark green, white or black. The glass takes the form of twisted masses, fragments or chunks up to 10 cm. Internally it has a flowing texture defined by lines of elliptical bubbles.Keiren T Howard, Peter Haines, 2004, Fire in the Sky above South West Tasmania. 17th Australian Geological Conference There are two kinds of Darwin glass when composition is measured. Type 1 is normally white or green whereas type 2 is normally black to dark green. The dark glass contains less silica and more magnesium and iron than the light green glass. The dark glass is also enriched in chromium, nickel and cobalt. A possible explanation for the chemical differences is that, in addition to being mainly composed of melted local metamorphic rocks, the type 2 glass also contains a component of extraterrestrial material from the meteorite.K.T. Howard, Geochemical Systematics In Darwin Impact Glass, 66th Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting (2003) Darwin glass has been dated at about 816,000 years old using argon dating methods.Ching-Hua Lo et al., 2002, Laser Fusion argon-40/argon-39 ages of Darwin Impact Glasses, Meteoritics and Planetary Science 37, p 1555-2002 paper Crater The glass is an impactite resulting from the melting of local rocks due to the impact of a large meteorite. The assumed source is a 1.2-kilometer-wide topographic depression known as Darwin Crater. The crater is filled with 230 m of sediments and breccia. A crater of that size would be created by a meteorite 20 to 50 m in diameter and its impact with Earth would release 20 megatons of energy.

Lundy became the player-manager of the Bacharach Giants from 1925 through 1928, leading the team to two Eastern Colored League pennants (1926, 1927). In the 1926 Negro League World Series, Lundy had six RBIs, four runs scored, and six stolen bases. The Giants, however, lost the series. Lundy made one appearance in the East-West All-Star Game, playing shortstop for the East. By this point, he had become part of what was called the \\"million dollar infield\\", along with Oliver Marcell, Frank Warfield, and Jud Wilson, playing for the Baltimore Black Sox in 1929.

It is also an administrative block. It is a small mining town located close to the Odisha border. It lies near to Jamshedpur and from Chaibasa. Nearby towns include Padapahar, Barajamda, jagannathpur, Kharsawan, Gua and Kiriburu. Overview The major produce of this mine is iron ore (including blue dust). The mines are run by the Tata Steel and most of the residents of this town are employed by this company. In the recent past a lot of private mine-owners have also set up shop in and around the town. A Pelletizing Plant of Tata Steel to convert blue dust to pellets, suitable for use in blast furnace functioned here from 1972 to 1986 but was closed down because it was not economically viable . The town is the right on the border of Jharkhand and Odisha with some of the iron-mines spanning the two states.The portion of iron mining area of Noamundi in the state of Odisha is called Katamati. Legend has it that when the first iron ore explorers came to this region, they were amazed to find the local tribal population (Adivasis) using iron axes. When the explorers asked the tribals where they had found the ore, they pointed to a hill nearby and called it Noamundi, which literally means 'that hill' in their language. The native tribal are known as Ho people and their language is also known by the same name, Ho. In spite of the commodity boom across the world over the last couple of years and the consequent effect of this on the area around Noamundi, the trickle down effect of this boom on the local Adivasi population has been negligible. Illegal mining thrives and is the rule rather than the exception. The result is the increased popularity of the Naxal movement in this area and in greater Jharkhand. Noamundi Township Geography Noamundi is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Noamundi It has an average elevation of 487 metres (1597 feet). Noamundi is located in the heart of Saranda forest, which is the densest deciduous forest of Asia. 'Saranda' in the local tribal language means 'The land of 700 hills'.The administrative boundary of the Saranda reserve forest, however, lie a few kilometres away. Along with dense forest cover Noamundi, is highly resourceful region. The place is rich in iron ore hematite and Indian multinations like TATA STEEL operate in this region. Apart from forest cover and mining belt, Noamundi has a diversified population, inside the TATA STEEL township people for various regions of India can be found, apart from that being the border of orissa and jharkhand, two most resourceful states of India cultural flavor of both the states can be seen here. With the scenic view of forest cover and hills of saranda forest this region is developing fast. Demographics India census, Noamundi had a population of 126,994. Males constitute 98% of the population and females 85%. Noamundi has an average literacy rate of 78%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 95%, and female literacy is 82%.

Kiesselbach's plexus (not labelled) is in the anterior inferior part of the nasal septum known as Little's area, where several arteries anastomose. Kiesselbach's plexus, is a vascular network of the five arteries that supply the nasal septum. The arteries anastomose to form the plexus which is a common site for nosebleeds. It lies in the anterior inferior part of the septum known as Little's area, also Kiesselbach's area, or Kiesselbach's triangle. The arteries are:Moore, Keith L. et al.

Most sources quote that it is not part of the plexus but rather one of the blood supplies for the nasal septum itself. It runs vertically downwards just behind the columella, crosses the floor of the nose and joins venous plexus on the lateral nasal wall. It is a common site for bleeding in young people. Clinical significance Ninety percent of nosebleeds (epistaxis) occur in Kiesselbach's plexus, as it is exposed to the drying effect of inspiratory currents and to finger nail trauma and is the usual site for nosebleeds in children and young adults. History James Lawrence Little (1836‚Äì1885), an American surgeon, first described the area in detail in 1879. Little described the area as being \\"about half an inch ... from the lower edge of the middle of the column [septum]\\".

It broadcasts on 1410 kHz. The station uses a three-tower array, broadcasting with 5,000 watts from a single tower until sundown, when the power is reduced to 1,000 watts and the pattern becomes directional from all three towers. In its early years, it produced several local programs, including the 6:00 News, with newscaster Gordon M. Ridenour, from 1947-1948. In the sixties, the station was home to a popular morning program \\"Stan and Russ on the Bus\\" hosted by Stan Douglas and Bill Russell. After that program left the air, Douglas continued to be involved with the station by hosting a well-received Sunday morning polka music program. For a time in the sixties and early seventies there was also a Saturday evening jazz program, \\"Twentieth Century Jazz\\" hosted by John \\"Cappy\\" Caparulo. For most of its history the station was affiliated with CBS Radio, and ran many network based shows including News on the Hour, CBS Mystery Theatre and Music and the Spoken Word. It was the market's dominant Top 40 station in the early 1970s, but in 1975 the station was purchased by New England broadcaster Robert Condit, who controversially changed the format to easy listening and middle-of-the-road standards, angering listeners and driving away the station's on-air staff. The move was a failure, and the format gradually shifted to adult contemporary in the later part of the decade. By 1990, it had become an oldies station. Later the station would switch to an all sports format. In 2019 the All Sports Format was changed to Classic Rock Gold with selective sports programming from MRN and local highschool sports. Also continue to air sports updates from CBS and NBC. The proper station name of WELM - The Sports Giant was updated to \\"The Pirate\\" and is currently broadcast on 1410 AM & 106.5 FM.

The mythic creature allegedly lived in \\"Lake Welmer,\\" their nickname (which has stuck) for a swampy area between Lake Street and Grand Central Avenue near the station's three towers. They referred to the creature often in bits, and sometimes produced \\"news reports\\" in which an intrepid reporter would try to interview the monster.

The carrier (underlying set) associated with a unit type can be any singleton set. There is an isomorphism between any two such sets, so it is customary to talk about the unit type and ignore the details of its value. One may also regard the unit type as the type of 0-tuples, i.e. the product of no types. The unit type is the terminal object in the category of types and typed functions. It should not be confused with the zero or bottom type, which allows no values and is the initial object in this category. Similarly, the Boolean is the type with two values. The unit type is implemented in most functional programming languages. The void type that is used in some imperative programming languages serves some of its functions, but because its carrier set is empty, it has some limitations (as detailed below). In programming languages Several computer programming languages provide a unit type to specify the result type of a function with the sole purpose of causing a side effect, and the argument type of a function that does not require arguments. *In Haskell and Rust, the unit type is called \`()\` and its only value is also \`()\`, reflecting the 0-tuple interpretation. *In ML descendants (including OCaml, Standard ML, and F#), the type is called \`unit\` but the value is written as \`()\`. *In Scala, the unit type is called \`Unit\` and its only value is written as \`()\`. *In Common Lisp the type named \`NULL\` is a unit type which has one value, namely the symbol \`NIL\`. This should not be confused with the \`NIL\` type, which is the bottom type. * In Python, there is a type called \`NoneType\` which allows the single value of \`None\`. * In Swift, the unit type is called \`Void\` or \`()\` and its only value is also \`()\`, reflecting the 0-tuple interpretation. * In Go, the unit type is written \`struct{}\` and its value is \`struct{}{}\`. * In PHP, the unit type is called null, which only value is NULL itself. * In JavaScript, both null and undefined are built-in unit types. * in Kotlin, \`Unit\` is a singleton with only one value: the \`Unit\` object. * In Ruby, \`nil\` is the only instance of the \`NilClass\` class. * In C++, the \`std::monostate\` unit type was added in C++17. = Void type as unit type = In C, C++, C#, D and Java, \`void\` is used to designate a function that does not return anything useful, or a function that accepts no arguments. The unit type in C is conceptually similar to an empty \`struct\`, but a struct without members is not allowed in the C language specification. Instead, '\`void\`' is used in a manner that simulates some, but not all, of the properties of the unit type, as detailed below. Like most imperative languages, C allows functions that do not return a value; these are specified as having the void return type. Such functions are called procedures in other imperative languages like Pascal, where a syntactic distinction, instead of type-system distinction, is made between functions and procedures.  Difference in calling convention  The first notable difference between a true unit type and the void type is that the unit type may always be the type of the argument to a function, but the void type cannot be the type of an argument in C, despite the fact that it may appear as the sole argument in the list. This problem is best illustrated by the following program, which is a compile-time error in C: void f(void) {} void g(void) {} int main(void) { f(g()); // compile-time error here return 0; } This issue does not arise in most programming practice in C, because since the \`void\` type carries no information, it is useless to pass it anyway; but it may arise in generic programming, such as C++ templates, where \`void\` must be treated differently from other types. In C++ however, empty classes are allowed, so it is possible to implement a real unit type; the above example becomes compilable as: class unit_type {}; const unit_type the_unit; unit_type f(unit_type) { return the_unit; } unit_type g(unit_type) { return the_unit; } int main() { f(g(the_unit)); return 0; } (For brevity, we're not worried in the above example whether \`the_unit\` is really a singleton; see singleton pattern for details on that issue.)  Difference in storage  The second notable difference is that the void type is special and can never be stored in a record type, i.e. in a struct or a class in C/C++. In contrast, the unit type can be stored in records in functional programming languages, i.e. it can appear as the type of a field; the above implementation of the unit type in C++ can also be stored. While this may seem a useless feature, it does allow one for instance to elegantly implement a set as a map to the unit type; in the absence of a unit type, one can still implement a set this way by storing some dummy value of another type for each key.  In Generics  In Java Generics, type parameters must be reference types. The wrapper type \`Void\` is often used when a unit type parameter is needed. Although the \`Void\` type can never have any instances, it does have one value, \`null\` (like all other reference types), so it acts as a unit type. In practice, any other non- instantiable type, e.g. \`Math\`, can also be used for this purpose, since they also have exactly one value, \`null\`. public static Void f(Void x) { return null; } public static Void g(Void x) { return null; } public static void main(String[] args) { f(g(null)); } See also * Singleton pattern (where a particular class has only one instance, but narrowly-typed non-nullable references to it are usually not held by other classes) References * * Category:Data types Category:Type theory Category:Articles with example Java code ","title":"Unit type"},{"id":"3646288","text":"Dandora is an eastern suburb in Nairobi, Kenya.

Dandora was established in 1977, with partial financing by the World Bank in order to offer a higher standard of housing.www.nd.edu The location is in part well known for being the site of the main municipal solid waste dump for Nairobi, which has significant negative health effects on its population  Dump site  Dandora - DumpsiteNairobi's principal dumping site is situated in Dandora. The Dandora Oxygenation Ponds, a prominent feature on satellite imagery of the area, is Nairobi's main sewage treatment works, and discharges processed water into the Nairobi River.BirdLife IBA Factsheet - Dandora Ponds Dandora is divided into 5 phases. Crime thrives here due to high rate of school drop out and the city's dumpsite. The dumpsite is an environmental hazard. The burning of the waste during the night can cause choking. Houses nearing the site are filled with smoke making it hard to breathe. Dandora is commonly attributed with flying toilets during the night which cause people sleepless nights at night. Dandora - Dumpsite from above Dandora - largest dumpsite in east Africa At the dumping site, many people experience health risks. For example, skin diseases are common for a big part of the people living there. Moreover, there are many resources of toxic waste. Inhabitants could experience health effects of this because the toxic substances that are in for example e-waste could end up in the air. Due to this, air pollution can emerge. Behind of this, people without access to a job collect waste to sell. Through this, there is a possibility of income. Besides the health risks that emerge due to waste, more hazards are apparent. As mentioned, crime rates are high and in some parts of the waste dump, police do not keep watch. Another risk can be seen in food insecurity. Because of a lack of proper food, people search for food in the waste. Eating food that is found in the waste could be dangerous for the health of the people living at Dandora. Furthermore, many children who are living at the waste dump have no access to education. Until now, solutions for the inhabitants have not emerged. A possible solution to the waste problem would be recycling. However, solutions should be searched not only to reduce the waste dump, but to help the inhabitants improve their quality of life.

In the Scottish version (shown right) the two have switched places and both are crowned, and the lion on top is coloured red. The Lion and the Unicorn are symbols of the United Kingdom. They are, properly speaking, heraldic supporters appearing in the full royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. The lion stands for England and the unicorn for Scotland. The combination therefore dates back to the 1603 accession of James I of England who was already James VI of Scotland. By extension, they have also been used in the arms of Hanover between 1837‚Äì1866 and the arms of Canada since 1921. Nursery rhyme The traditional legend of enmity between the two heraldic animals is recorded in a nursery rhyme which has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 20170. It is usually given with the lyrics: The Lion and the Unicorn as they appear in A Nursery Rhyme Picture Book by L. Leslie Brooke. :The lion and the unicorn :Were fighting for the crown :The lion beat the unicorn :All around the town. :Some gave them white bread, :And some gave them brown; :Some gave them plum cake :and drummed them out of town. The legend of the two animals may have been intensified by the Acts of Union 1707 and it was one year later that William King (1663‚Äì1712) recorded a verse very similar to the first stanza of the modern rhyme.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 442-3. This seems to have grown to include several other verses. Apart from those above only one survives: :And when he had beat him out, :He beat him in again; :He beat him three times over, :His power to maintain. John Tenniel's illustration for Through the Looking-Glass. This rhyme was played upon by Lewis Carroll, who incorporated the lion and the unicorn as characters in his 1871 novel Through the Looking-Glass. Here, the crown they are fighting for belongs to the White King which, given that they are on the White side as well, makes their rivalry all the more absurd. Carroll subverts the traditional view of a lion being alert and calculating by making this particular one slow and rather stupid, although clearly the better fighter. The role of the Unicorn is likewise reversed by the fact that he sees Alice as a \\"monster\\", though he promises to start believing in her if she will believe in him. Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for the section caricature Benjamin Disraeli as the Unicorn, and William Ewart Gladstone as the Lion, alluding to the pair's frequent parliamentary battles, although there is no evidence that this was Carroll's intention.Picture Origins - Lenny's Alice in Wonderland site See also *Lion and Unicorn Staircase *Royal coat of arms of Scotland *Coat of arms of Canada *Queen Elizabeth Gate Notes References * Baker, E.D.

Dixon was noticed for his quick and powerful bat by William Strothers, who was building up the independent Giants at the time. When Dixon began playing for Strothers in the 1920s, the outfield for the Giants was one of the best of all time; Dixon, Oscar Charleston, and Fats Jenkins. The lineup, in its entirety, scored runs at a higher pace than the 1927 New York Yankees. Dixon had many weapons; speed, hitting, and power were all his strengths and he became known as a triple threat. In 1929, he batted .382 with seven home runs, and led the league with six triples. Dixon was also notable for discovering the Baseball Hall of Famer Leon Day playing in the Baltimore sandlots. In a doubleheader played on Saturday, July 5, 1930, Dixon helped make history at Yankee Stadium, which, for the first time ever, played host to two Negro league teams. With 20,000 in attendance, Dixon hit one home run in the opener, then two more in the nightcap to help Baltimore salvage a split with the Lincoln Giants.Nunn, William G. \\"Diamond Stars Rise to Miracle Heights in Big Game at Yankee Bowl; Five Home Runs Made as 'Brownskin' Editions of Gehrig and Ruth Thrill Colorful Gathering of 20,000 Fans\\".

History  In early 1963, the Kingsmen, a band based in Portland, Oregon, became known for their hit version of the song \\"Louie, Louie\\". After its hit single, the band soon embarked on a 50-state national tour. Because the band was used to playing small hops and school dances, many of the members found themselves ill-equipped with the amplifiers that they were currently using. Bassist Norm Sundholm discovered that his bass amp was not nearly powerful enough to play larger concert halls. Sundholm enlisted the help of his brother Conrad to help solve his problem. By 1964, the Sundholm brothers had designed a high-powered concert bass amplifier. The early Sunn amplifiers relied heavily on tube amplifiers designed by David Hafler and preamps sold by the Dynaco Hi-fi company, with many of the first units actually containing power amplifier chassis sold by Dynaco (models MKII, MKIII, MKIV) as well as modified Dyna PAS1 preamplifiers. By 1965, the demand for Sundholm's amplifiers had increased to the point where the family garage could no longer be used as the manufacturing facility. At this point the Sunn amplifiers still relied on the Dyna power amp circuitry, reworked to fit Sunn's own chassis but still employing Dyna produced and branded transformers and the same electronic design. Thus, the Sunn Musical Equipment Company was founded. Throughout the original Sunn Amplifier line they employed Dynaco designed and built transformers (up to the 120 watt MK VI transformer set) and Hafler based power amp designs until Sunn stopped producing the original line of tube amplifiers in favor or the solid-state Concert and Coliseum models. Later Sunn produced the electronically unrelated Model T tube amps. Fender acquired Sunn in 1985, relocating operations from Tualatin to Lake Oswego. The stated intent was to both revitalize the Sunn amplifier lines and to produce some Fender-branded models as well, which included the Standard Series (Princeton Chorus and Ultra/Ultimate Chorus, both solid-state) and M-80 Series, and are identified as USA-made amplifiers with an \\"LO\\"-prefix serial number. Fender shut down the Sunn operation in 2002. The band Sunn O))) was named after the company (to the point of including a typographic representation of the logo).

The band recorded and self-released two early EPs, before beginning an association with Sydney-based independent record label Nonzero Records, founded in 2001.Australian Music Online :: Interviews :: Nick Carr - Nonzero Records Through Nonzero Records, the band met producer Jamie Hutchings, leader of label-mates Bluebottle Kiss, who produced their first album, 2003's Professional Againster (named after a song by New Bomb Turks), and their second LP, The New Violence, released in 2005. According to critic Mark Nielsen, \\"The New Violence shows a darker side to the group, with songs that are still well crafted yet less immediate\\". From http://www.peabody.net.au/press6.html Their single, \\"Got You On My Radar\\", featuring guest vocals from Sarah Blasko, reached No. 13 on the AIR charts. Midway through 2006, drummer Graeme Trewin left the band, and was replaced later that year by Jared Harrison, also of Bluebottle Kiss. Early in 2007 Tristan Courtney-Prior joined the band as a second guitarist. In June 2007, Peabody recorded their third album, Prospero, again produced by Hutchings. The first single, \\"The Devil For Sympathy\\", was released in September that year, followed by the album in October 2008. In May 2010, Peabody's self-produced fourth album, Loose Manifesto, was recorded by Tim Kevin and released on the band's own label Peabrain Recordings through MGM Distribution in October 2010.

A compression lock can cause a joint lock in a nearby joint when it is applied by squeezing a limb over a fulcrum. A forceful compression lock may damage muscles and tendons, and if accompanied by a joint lock, may also result in torn ligaments, dislocation or bone fractures. Compression locks can be used as pain compliance holds, and are sometimes featured in combat sports as submission holds. Achilles lock An Achilles lock (also called an Achilles hold or Achilles squeeze or Ashi-Hishigi in judo) is a compression lock that involves pressing the Achilles tendon into the back of the ankle or lower leg. It is typically performed by wedging a forearm, especially a bony part of it, into the Achilles tendon, while leveraging the foot and the leg over the forearm serving as a fulcrum. This causes severe pressure on the Achilles tendon, and often also results in an ankle lock, since the ankle is being used as a point of leverage. Similarly, some ankle locks also cause a compression lock on the Achilles tendon, and hence the term \\"Achilles lock\\" is often also used to describe such ankle locks. Biceps slicer A biceps slicer (also called a biceps lock or biceps crusher) is a compression lock that involves pressing the biceps into the humerus. An effective biceps slicer can be applied by putting an arm or leg as a fulcrum on the opponent's arm at the inside of the arm by the elbow, and flexing the opponent's arm over the fulcrum. This will result in the biceps and forearm being pressed into the fulcrum. The biceps slicer becomes most effective as a compression lock when the bony parts of the limb such as the shin or any of the bones in the forearm are forced into the biceps of the opponent. The biceps slicer can also become a potent armlock when it is applied in this manner, because the leverage causes an elongating and separating tension in the elbow joint, making this a legal technique in judo competition.International Judo Federation. IJF Referee Rules . www.ijf.org. URL last accessed August 18, 2006. In Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitions however, the biceps slicer is an illegal technique in lower level divisions of some major tournaments.International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation. Rules . www.cbjj.com.br. URL last accessed August 18, 2006. In catch wrestling biceps slicer variation is called short-arm scissors. Leg slicer A leg slicer (depending on the affected muscle also called for instance calf slicer or thigh crusher) is a compression lock that involves pressing the calf and/or thigh muscle into one of the bones in the leg. Similarly to the biceps slicer, a leg slicer can be applied by inserting an arm or leg in the backside of the knee, and flexing the opponent's leg to apply pressure to the muscles surrounding the fulcrum. Generally, the direction of the shin in the leg acting as a fulcrum will determine where the larger part of the pressure will go. Such leg slicers can be used as effective leglocks to the knee through a separating and elongating motion. Similarly to the biceps slicer, the calf slicer is listed as a banned technique in the lower levels of some major Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitions. Wrestler AJ Styles uses this as a submission finisher move, calling it the Calf Killer in NJPW and TNA and the Calf Crusher in WWE.

A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of registration of the birth and which then appears on a birth certificate (see birth name), but may change subsequently. Most jurisdictions require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a name change to be recorded at marriage. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes their first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations). A person's legal name typically is the same as their personal name, comprising a given name and a family name. The order varies according to culture and country. There are also country-by- country differences on changes of legal names by marriage. (See married name.) Most countries require by law the registration of a name for newborn children, and some can refuse registration of \\"undesirable\\" names. In 1991, a Swedish couple refused to give their newborn a legal name, in protest of existing naming laws. In 1996, they were fined for not registering a name for their child for five years, after they unsuccessfully tried to register the child's name as Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116, and then as \\"A\\". Jurisdiction by country =Canada= Quebec The Civil Code of Quebec states that \\"Every person exercises his civil rights under the name assigned to him and stated in his act of birth,\\" and spouses retain their legal names upon marriage. They can be changed, upon registration, only under prescribed conditions, and only where the person is a Canadian citizen who has been domiciled in Qu√©bec for at least one year. =Germany= In Germany, names are regulated to a large extent. Apart from possibly adopting the partner's name upon marriage, German citizens may only change their name for a recognised important reason. Among other reasons, a change of names is permitted when the name can give rise to confusion, ridicule, unusual orthographic difficulties, or stigmatization. In certain situations, children's last names may also be changed to their natural, foster or adoptive parent's last name. Transgender people may change their first names. Foreign names in writing systems that are not based on Latin are transliterated according to rules which may conflict with the system of transcribing or transliterating names that is used in the country of origin. Former titles of nobility became integrated into the last names in 1919 but continue to be adapted according to gender and other circumstances.. =United Kingdom= In the UK, businesses that trade under names other than those of the owner or a corporate entity must display the name of owner and an address at which documents may be served, or the name and registered number of the corporate body and its registered address. The requirements apply to sole traders and partnerships, but there are special provisions for large partnerships where listing all partners would be onerous. The information must be shown on any trading premises where the public have access to trade and in documents such as order forms, receipts and, as of January 2007, corporate websites (to be extended later in 2007 to sole trader websites). England and Wales In strict English law, if there is such a thing as a \\"legal\\" surname, it is easily changed. In the words of A dictionary of American and English law, \\"Any one may take on himself whatever surname or as many surnames as he pleases, without statutory licence\\". This does not always seem to have applied to names given in baptism. As noted by Sir Edward Coke in Institutes of the Lawes of England, \\"a man may have divers names at divers times, but not divers Christian names.\\" But in modern practice all names are freely changeable. Changes of name are usually effected through deed poll, optionally enrolled either at the High Court of Justice or at the College of Arms, with a notice recorded in The London Gazette. Changes may also be made by means of a Royal License obtained through the College of Arms, with similar notice. These enrolment, licence and notice procedures are useful for having the new name appear in official documents. Scotland Scots Law allows anyone who wishes to do so to change their forename(s) or surname and such changes may be recorded in the official register held by the National Records of Scotland. Technically the Registrar General makes a correction to the entry. A correction can be recorded where a birth has been registered in Scotland, or where a person is the subject in Scotland of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, the Parental Order Register or the Gender Recognition Register. The above formalities are not necessary where a spouse/partner assumes the other spouse/partner's surname upon marriage or civil partnership, or reverts to their original name upon separation, divorce or dissolution of the civil partnership. Only one change of name is allowed in the register where a person has not yet reached the age of 16, and afterwards only one change of forename and three changes of surname may be granted during a person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname.

He was the founder of the company Stuart Turner Ltd. Biography Turner was born in Shepherds Bush, London in 1869. Little is known about his childhood or adolescence although it is known that his family's ambitions for him did not include becoming an engineer. Career After a series of other jobs including an apprenticeship on the Clyde building marine engines, a period at sea and working as an engineer in Jersey (where he installed electricity generating plant), Turner gained employment in 1897 looking after the steam generating plant at Shiplake Court near Henley-on-Thames, England.H. Sanderson, \\"Short History of Stuart Turner\\", November 1938, Archived from Stuart Marine Engines websiteStuart Turner website \\"About Us\\" In those days mains electricity was rare and therefore most large houses had their own electricity generating plants. It was while working at Shiplake that Turner designed his No.1 Model Steam Engine. He drew up the patterns which he then sent away to be cast. On their return he machined and assembled them and soon showed the finished model at a local exhibition. He then approached Percival Marshall the editor of Model Engineer magazine who wrote an article about the engine. This coverage brought an immediate response and orders for sets of castings flooded in, and a business was established in 1898. He was joined in the business by Alexander Frederick (Alec) Plint in 1903, who he had worked with in Jersey and was trained in electrical engineering. This business produced an unusual mixture of small mainly two-stroke engines used in boats, generators, as well as model engines and castings aimed at the model engineering market. They also briefly made a motorcycle and the Stuart lathe, and latterly a range of centrifugal pumps. The name Stuart Turner is eponymous with small quality models, and many of the steam models and rarer internal combustion models are much sought after by collectors. The Stuart Turner Ltd company was established in 1906 in Henley-on-Thames. Death Stuart Turner left the firm in 1920 and went to South Africa. He returned to Southend to retire and died in April 1938.

The highway starts in rural Indiana south of the state line as a state road connection to the Indiana Toll Road. As the road crosses into Michigan it becomes a state trunkline highway that connects to the metropolitan areas of Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids before continuing north to its terminus at Petoskey. US 131 runs as a freeway from south of Portage through to Manton in the north. Part of this freeway runs concurrently with Interstate 296 (I-296) as an unsigned designation through Grand Rapids. US 131 forms an important corridor along the western side of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, running through rural farm and forest lands as well as urban cityscapes. Various names have been applied to the roadway over the years. The oldest, the Mackinaw Trail, originated from an Indian trail in the area while other names honored politicians. An attempt to dedicate the highway to poet James Whitcomb Riley failed to gain official support in Michigan. The first state highways along the US 131 corridor were designated as early as 1919. When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US 131 was created along the route of M-13 in Michigan. Originally ending at Fife Lake on the north end, the highway was extended to Petoskey in the late 1930s. Further changes were made, starting in the 1950s, to convert segments of the road to a full freeway. The state started this conversion simultaneously at two locations: heading north from Three Rivers, and heading both north and south from a point in southern Kent County. A third segment was built south of Cadillac and over subsequent years Michigan filled the gaps in the freeway. Cadillac and Manton were bypassed in the early part of the 21st century, resulting in the current freeway configuration. Another large-scale construction project in 2000 rebuilt an unusual section of the freeway through Grand Rapids known as the S-Curve. Two bridges formerly used by US 131 have been labeled by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as historic structures; one of them has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Plans to further extend the freeway have either been canceled or placed back under study. Upgrades on the north end through Kalkaska ceased to be considered in 2000. South of Three Rivers, MDOT is studying possible upgrades to US 131\\\\. One option for these upgrades is a full freeway, an option that was initially rejected. The preferred alternative in 2008 was a two-lane bypass of Constantine that opened in October 2013. Route description Running in Indiana and Michigan, US 131 in its entirety is listed as a part of the National Highway System, a system of roads crucial to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. As a state highway in both states, the roadway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and MDOT. The Michigan section includes approximately of freeway between Kalamazoo and Wexford counties. =Indiana= US 131 extends through Elkhart County, Indiana, between the entrance to the Indiana Toll Road, a few hundred feet north of the Toll Road overpass, and the state line to the north. State Road 13 (SR 13) runs concurrently with US 131 in this section but is not signposted. INDOT surveys the roads under its control on a regular basis to measure the amount of traffic using the state's highways. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. The 2007 survey reported average daily traffic of 7,949 cars and 2,068 trucks. =Southwest Michigan= alt=Photograph of the As a state trunkline highway, US 131 runs approximately in Michigan, from the Indiana state line north to Petoskey. The highway is an important link between Grand Rapids and the tourist areas of Northern Michigan. The trunkline enters Michigan about three miles () south of White Pigeon, crossing a branch of the Michigan Southern Railroad before meeting US 12 on the west side of the village. The highway passes through rural farmland north to just south of Constantine, where US 131 turns northwestward to bypass the downtown business district, crosses the St. Joseph River and continues north to Three Rivers. The stretch of highway between Constantine and the start of the divided highway south of Three Rivers averaged 7,579 cars and 1,045 trucks daily in 2009 according to MDOT, one of the lowest AADT counts for the highway in Michigan. US 131 runs through a business corridor along the west side of Three Rivers. M-60 runs concurrently along this part of US 131 until the two highways meet the south end of the business loop through town. The main road curves to the northeast as it leaves town, and M-60 turns east to follow Business US 131 (Bus. US 131) into downtown. The trunkline runs parallel to a branch of the Grand Elk Railroad. North of the other end of the business loop, US 131 follows a four-lane surface highway through rural farmland in northern St. Joseph County. The highway has at-grade junctions with cross roads, but otherwise has limited access from adjoining property. This arrangement ends on the south side of Schoolcraft, where the highway transitions to follow Grand Street through town. North of town US 131 returns to an expressway as the highway continues through southern Kalamazoo County farmland. After an intersection with Shaver Road, US 131 widens into a full freeway which passes the Gourdneck State Game Area as it enters the Kalamazoo metropolitan area. US 131 meets I-94 southwest of Kalamazoo. Further north, the freeway crosses the Stadium Drive interchange, which connects downtown Kalamazoo near the main campuses of Western Michigan University and Kalamazoo College. At the next exit, US 131 picks up the M-43 as the latter highway runs concurrently northward. As the freeway passes the west side of Kalamazoo the environs change to a more forested and semi-residential area. US 131 passes the northern end of Bus. US 131, a freeway spur accessible from the southbound lanes of US 131\\\\. North of this partial interchange the freeway crosses into eastern Allegan County. =West Michigan= alt=Aerial photograph of As US 131 passes through the outskirts of Plainwell, it curves to the northeast through a commercial area centered around the interchange with M-89; M-43 departs the freeway at this exit. North of this area US 131 crosses the Kalamazoo River and runs past the US 131 Raceway Park, a dragstrip close to the M-222 interchange near Martin. The freeway continues north through mixed farm and forest land to the residential areas that abut it in Wayland. Further north the highway crosses into Kent County and the southern end of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area. As the freeway continues farther north, and closer to Grand Rapids, it is lined with more commercial and light industrial properties. The unincorporated suburb of Cutlerville lies to the east as US 131 approaches M-6, the South Beltline Freeway, and meets in the largest freeway interchange in West Michigan. Gaining a third lane in each direction, the interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8 km) in width and over a mile (1.6 km) in lengthAs measured by mainline freeway lane lengths. and encompasses 27 bridges and 18 retaining walls. US 131 continues north through the city of Wyoming to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of Grand Rapids north of M-11 (28th Street). alt=Photograph of The freeway continues through the southern end of Grand Rapids, alongside residential areas until Burton Street. A large rail yard abuts the trunkline on the east, and the freeway turns northeasterly on its approach to downtown. At Wealthy Street, the freeway takes a sharp turn to the west to cross the Grand River and immediately turns back north on a bridge structure known as the S-Curve. The highest traffic volumes along US 131 are located north of this river crossing. In 2009, MDOT measured an AADT of 107,200 cars and 5,992 trucks through the stretch between Market Avenue and Pearl Street. The trunkline continues past the Gerald R. Ford Museum and the Public Museum of Grand Rapids before the northbound carriageway crosses over, then back under, the southbound lanes, forcing traffic through this stretch to briefly drive on the left. North of I-196, US 131 picks up a second, hidden designation on highway inventory logs called I-296, although the number is not signposted along the road. I-296/US 131 continues along the banks of the Grand River into Walker where the hidden I-296 designation turns to the northwest along a series of ramps to I-96 while US 131 curves to the northeast along a bend in the river. As it continues along the river the freeway passes through the unincorporated community of Comstock Park and near to Fifth Third Ballpark, home of the West Michigan Whitecaps local minor league baseball team. The trunkline turns north, away from the river, as it nears the stadium and passes through the remainder of the northern suburb, changing to a more rural character as the freeway passes through the northern end of Kent County. M-46 joins US 131 from the west at Cedar Springs and the two highways pass into northwestern Montcalm County near Sand Lake. North of Pierson the landscape is dominated by forests. M-46 turns east and leaves the freeway near Howard City while US 131 continues into Mecosta County near the Little Muskegon River. The freeway forms the eastern boundary of the Manistee National Forest near the river and north to Big Rapids. Further north M-20 joins the US 131 freeway near Stanwood and the two highways cross the Muskegon River on the way to Big Rapids. The city is served by its own business loop and M-20 turns east off the freeway along Bus. US 131 toward the main campus of Ferris State University. North of Big Rapids US 131 runs through rural Osceola County to a junction with US 10 at Reed City. =Northern Michigan= alt=Photograph of a tree full of shoes tied together and hanging from the branches Passing through rural Osceola County and providing access to rural communities such as Le Roy and Tustin, US 131 approaches the south side of Cadillac in Wexford County. At exit 176, M-55 leaves a concurrency with M-115 and joins the US 131 freeway around the east side of Cadillac. This bypass was built in the early 21st century and the old routing is now a business loop through downtown. M-55 follows the freeway to exit 180 while US 131 continues around the east side of Cadillac and north around the east side of Manton. The lowest freeway traffic counts along US 131, 7,455 cars and 709 trucks in 2009, are on the northeast side of Manton, as the trunkline transitions back to a two-lane undivided highway before meeting the north end of Manton's business loop. The two-lane highway runs through the Pere Marquette State Forest and over the Manistee River, crossing the southeast corner of Grand Traverse County. It meets the southern end of M-113 in Walton, where it runs parallel to the Great Lakes Central Railroad. Passing through Fife Lake, US 131 crosses into Kalkaska County and to South Boardman. The area around South Boardman is marked by farmland as the trunkline crosses the Boardman River in the small unincorporated community. The road once again runs parallel to the railroad as it meets M-66/M-72 south of Kalkaska. The three highways join and run concurrently through downtown. North of town M-72 turns west toward Traverse City and US 131/M-66 continues north through farmland into Antrim County. About north of town, standing on the west side of the road, is the Shoe Tree. A local icon since shortly after the turn of the 21st century, the origins of the landmark are unknown. The trunkline follows the railroad into Antrim and Mancelona. North of downtown Mancelona M-66 turns north toward Charlevoix and US 131 continues along the Mackinaw Trail, through Alba. M-32 follows US 131 for a half mile (0.8 km) near the community of Elmira. As it continues farther north US 131 enters the Mackinaw State Forest. Here, MDOT has calculated the lowest average daily traffic counts of all on US 131: 5,114 cars and 448 trucks in 2009. The highway passes through rural Charlevoix County where the terrain has many rolling hills and begins to descend to Lake Michigan. As the highway enters the southern section of the city of Petoskey it runs along Spring Street passing retail establishments and the Odawa Casino, owned by the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation of the Odawa Indians. At the northern terminus of US 131, US 31 turns off Charlevoix Avenue and follows Spring Street to the north. =Services= alt=Photo of the MDOT operates 67 rest areas and 14 welcome centers in the state, all named in honor of retired department employees, although in some cases an honoree's name may be dropped from the rest area. Eight of these are along US 131, providing bathroom facilities, dog runs, picnic areas and usually vending machines. The rest areas near Kalamazoo, Rockford, Big Rapids and Tustin serve southbound traffic while those near Morley and Cadillac serve the northbound side of the freeway. The two near Manton and Fife Lake are accessible from both directions. A ninth rest area used to exist near Cutlerville on the northbound side of US 131, but this location was demolished on January 22, 2001, to make way for the interchange with M-6. The department wanted to build a replacement near Dorr, in northern Allegan County, but the plans were canceled in late 2001. MDOT has also built carpool lots for motorists along the freeway. There are 21 lots, all but one adjacent to a freeway interchange. The department touts these lots as a way to save money and benefit the environment, and has partnered with a network of local agencies offering Local Rideshare Offices. History =Early history= Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the Indian trails. The original Mackinaw Trail ran roughly parallel to the route of the modern US 131 from east of Kalkaska to Petoskey. In the 19th century, the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. Two thoroughfares in the Grand Rapids area, Division and Plainfield avenues, were originally plank roads. The companies were funded through the collection of tolls. The infrastructure was expensive to maintain, and often the turnpikes fell into disrepair as the wood warped and rotted away. Mark Twain once commented that \\"the road could not have been bad if some unconscionable scoundrel had not now and then dropped a plank across it,\\" after a trip on the Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids Plank Road. By the first decade of the 20th century, only 23 of the 202 chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century. The first state- maintained highway along the path of US 131 was M-13, a designation applied to the road by July 1, 1919. US 131 debuted along with the rest of the initial U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926, although at the time it was shown on maps from the Michigan‚ÄìIndiana state line north to the small Northern Michigan community of Acme in Grand Traverse County. The northernmost section of the highway between Fife Lake and Acme was not signposted in the field and the designation ended instead at Fife Lake, about north of the state line. At the same time, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) redesignated the remainder of M-13, between Fife Lake and Petoskey, as M-131. Public Act 131 of 1931 allowed the MSHD to take control over the city streets that carried state highways through cities in the state.Public Act 131 of 1931. Michigan Legislature. Until this point, the City of Grand Rapids arbitrarily moved the route of state highways through the city on a regular basis. The department took control of a series of streets and fixed the routing of US 131 through the city after the passage of the act. The highway was shifted between Three Rivers and Constantine to the west side of the St. Joseph River in 1936. In late 1938 or early 1939, the MSHD extended US 131 northward over the southern section of M-131. After the changes US 131 turned eastward into Fife Lake and north to Kalkaska and Mancelona before ending in Petoskey. This extension connected US 131 directly to its parent highway, US 31, for the first time. By the end of the 1930s, the MSHD under the leadership of future governor Murray Van Wagoner had shifted emphasis to a program of road improvements designed to make the state's roads \\"safer and smoother for burgeoning traffic volumes.\\". In 1940, a new roadway was opened, completing the third side of a triangle between the junction with M-113, Walton Corners and Fife Lake. US 131 was shifted to the new highway and the former routing along the other two sides of the triangle became part of M-113 and M-186. A second realignment opened the following year between Fife Lake and Kalkaska. US 131 no longer turned east along Boardman Road between South Boardman and Lodi. Instead the MSHD rerouted the highway directly to the northeast, from the end of the previous new routing north of Fife Lake to Kalaska. By 1945, a Bypass US 131 was created around the south and east sides of Grand Rapids, following 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue, while the main highway continued to run through downtown unchanged. A decade later, mainline US 131 was rerouted around Grand Rapids over the former bypass route, and Business US 131 (Bus. US 131) was created for the former route through downtown. A second business loop was created in Three Rivers, Michigan, after an expressway bypass of the city's downtown was opened in early 1954. Another expressway section was opened between Mancelona and the M-32 junction west of Elmira in late 1956. =Freeway conversion= The former cloverleaf interchange between US 131 and Stadium Drive west of Kalamazoo in 2010 before conversion to a alt=Aerial photograph of By the end of 1957, US 131 had been realigned as an expressway from the Three Rivers bypass to Moorepark. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland by the middle of 1958. By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect back to the old routing. The southern end of US 131 was moved to another location on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with US 112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US 131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US 131. The MSHD had proposed that the section of US 131 south of Kalamazoo be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors the same year; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead. Another project, through the end of 1961, extended the freeway south to Plainwell and north into downtown Grand Rapids. This extension was designated as part of Bus. US 131 and opened in December 1961. The opening ceremony for the bridge across the Grand River included the state highway commission and the then-Miss Michigan, pulled by a team of sled dogs, to lead the first traffic over the river. Until the early 1960s, US 131 never left the state of Michigan; the southernmost point was always at the Indiana state line. In 1961, the highway designation was extended to its current southern terminus in rural Elkhart County, Indiana at a connection with the Indiana Toll Road at the request of the state of Michigan. The MSHD asked the Indiana State Highway Department (ISHD) to extend US 131 farther to reconnect with US 31 in Indiana near Indianapolis. Michigan State Highway Commissioner John C. Mackie said that officials with the IHSD were \\"receptive to the idea\\" of a further addition to Indianapolis which would provide a \\"great benefit to Michigan's tourist industry\\". alt=Map On December 17, 1962, the freeway through downtown Grand Rapids was completed, including the section marked as I-296. The business loop was removed from the freeway when US 131 took its place. East Beltline Avenue was renumbered as an extension of M-44, while 28th Street retains the M-11/M-21 designations it had in addition to US 131\\\\. I-296/US 131 runs alongside the Grand River between I-96 downtown and I-196 north of town. At the end of I-296, US 131 followed I-196 east to the northern portion of the business loop at Plainfield Avenue and followed Plainfield Avenue back to the remainder of its routing north of Grand Rapids. The other end of the freeway was extended south to M-43 on the west side of Kalamazoo. Traffic there is directed along M-43 into downtown to connect with the remainder of the highway. Freeway construction continued through the 1960s. By the end of 1963, the southern section of freeway was extended to Schoolcraft. The following year, a business loop in Kalamazoo was created. The new loop used a freeway stub on the north and M-43 on the south to connect the main highway to the former routing of US 131 along Westnedge and Park avenues downtown. A discontinuous segment of freeway, south of Cadillac into Osceola County, opened in September 1966. The freeway was extended north from the Grand Rapids area through the Comstock Park area in 1966. That year, the former Grand Rapids Speedrome, a local race car track was closed. Located on North Park Street between the North Park Bridge and West River Drive, the track was in operation from 1950 until it was closed for the freeway construction in 1966. The freeway was extended further to M-57 (14 Mile Road) near Cedar Springs in 1969. In 1968, the section of expressway near Mancelona was downgraded to a two-lane highway. The original roadway had been left in place when a new parallel carriageway was built in 1956. During the winter months, the original lanes built in the 1920s were closed because the grade of the roadway accumulated additional snow and made it difficult to plow. The MSHD had considered reconstructing the older road to retain the expressway setup, but that would have cost $1.5 million while removing it and permanently reconfiguring the 1956 roadway cost only $170,000 (equivalent to $ and $ in ). The 1970s saw the US 131 freeway expand to north of Grand Rapids. The section between the two M-57 junctions near Rockford and in Cedar Springs opened on September 21, 1973, at a dedication ceremony featuring then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. By the end of the year, the freeway would be open as far north as Howard City. At the same time, M-46 was realigned to extend south down the freeway to Cedar Springs and west to replace M-57 west of Rockford. Construction to complete these sections north of Grand Rapids had been delayed in 1967. Before the delays, the MSHD planned to have the gap in the freeway between Grand Rapids and Cadillac completed by 1974. The state even proposed adding the freeway north of Grand Rapids to Petoskey, with a further continuation to Mackinaw City as part of the Interstate Highway System in an effort to receive additional funding in 1968. In September 1972, the US 131 Area Development Association lobbied Congress to \\"expedite funding and priority for the reconstruction of US 131 in Michigan.\\" alt=Photograph of a The section of US 131 freeway south of the Wexford‚ÄìOsceola county line was opened on November 9, 1976, at a cost of $7.4 million (equivalent to $ in ). By 1977, the state postponed any plans to complete the freeway north of Cadillac. The department cited rising construction material costs and opposition to the freeway in Petoskey. By the end of the decade, I-296 signs were removed from the section of freeway in Grand Rapids. However, the freeway remains listed as a part of the Interstate Highway System. The next section of freeway opened between Howard City and Stanwood in 1980. Another segment was opened farther north, bypassing Big Rapids by 1984. The former route through town and a section of M-20 were designated as a business loop simultaneously. US 131 followed 19 Mile Road between the end of the freeway and the former routing north of town. The gap was filled in when the freeway segment between Big Rapids and Osceola County was opened in 1986. The section of highway along 19 Mile Road was transferred to the Big Rapids business loop to connect it back to the new freeway. When the expansions ended, in the mid-1980s, it was expected that the US 131 freeway would end at the south side of Cadillac, \\"perhaps forever\\". MDOT had ended all consideration of additional freeway mileage in 1981, citing decreased gas tax revenues, decreased traffic and higher construction costs. A 1979 report said that while traffic forecasts showed continued growth, upgrades to existing roads would be sufficient to handle traffic needs. =S-Curve replacement= One of the more unusual sections of the US 131 freeway in the Grand Rapids area is the S-Curve. This section of freeway carries US 131 over the Grand River with two sharp turns in the road, resembling the letter S. The design for this structure was completed in 1952 and placed the freeway on the least expensive land in the area, despite the knowledge that it would someday create issues. As noted by The Grand Rapids Press in 1981, \\"the speed limit on the S-Curve must be reduced as low as 25 mph [] on some bad-weather days because of the sharpness of the turns and [the] numerous accidents [that] have occurred there.\\" On December 27, 1999, the state awarded an $85.7 million contract (equivalent to $ in ) for the replacement of the S-Curve on US 131. Deposits of gypsum under the roadway were dissolving and causing it to settle. A deteriorating bridge also forced the reconstruction of the freeway through the area. Construction began on January 15, 2000, diverting the roughly 115,000 vehicles per day that used the stretch of road to detours through the downtown area. As part of the project, a $1.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) de-icing system was installed. The system is designed to spray a de-icing fluid on the roadway that would be carried by car tires up to a mile (1.6 km) along the road surface. This fluid is expected to melt ice at temperatures below the at which salt stops working. Unlike salt, the non-corrosive de-icer does not harm the bridge, but it is more costly. The system is designed to be activated manually, or automatically via sensors along the road. However, plowing would still be required on the roadway. The idea behind the de-icing system is to keep the pavement wet and prevent the formation of ice. Construction delays were caused by river flooding during spring rains. A design mistake meant that one of the bridges in the structure was built a foot () too low, and Grandville Avenue was lowered to compensate for the error. Before the opening, MDOT held a ribbon- cutting ceremony on the freeway to allow local residents to walk along the structure on August 12. The first northbound lanes were opened to traffic in mid-August, three weeks ahead of schedule. Lead contractor Kiewit Western, a company whose \\"employees have been known to work 13-hour days and 100-hour weeks\\", accelerated their work schedule over the course of the project to compensate for the delays and still finish the venture early. The remaining lanes opened to traffic on October 26, also ahead of schedule. Additional work started after the main roadway opened by closing various ramps for reconstruction. This work also focused on restoring parking lots located under or adjacent to the freeway and testing the de-icing system; the final ramps were opened in early December 2000 and early January 2001. The end result of the construction produced a freeway design that increased the rated traffic speed from . =21st century changes= alt=Photograph of MDOT approved a $3.5 billion 10-year transportation plan (equivalent to $ in ) in 1986 that included an extension of the US 131 freeway north to Manton. Construction started on the Cadillac bypass in 1999, and the first section was opened to traffic in November 2000. This southern segment ran from US 131 south of town to M-55 east of downtown. US 131 remained routed through downtown, but M-55 was rerouted to the bypass. Local residents were allowed to use the northern section of the bypass for recreational activities until it was opened to traffic. The full bypass around Cadillac was dedicated to Sidney Ouwinga in a ceremony on October 27, 2001, and the road was opened to traffic on October 30, 2001. The former routing through town was redesignated Bus. US 131 at the same time. Ouwinga was a state lawmaker who died in 1991 while serving in the Michigan House of Representatives. He was also a member of the US 131 Area Development Association which promoted further northern extensions of the freeway. The freeway expansion north around the city of Manton was opened in 2003. The former routing was redesignated as a business loop at the time. The two bypasses cost $146 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete. Design plans for the new bridge over the St. Joseph River were announced in January 2011. The expected groundbreaking on the venture was scheduled for February 4, 2013, with planned completion in 2014. Residents in the community were divided over the proposed highway. Business owners look to the 3,000 cars and trucks that pass through downtown Constantine each day for customers, traffic that would be diverted around the village by the new roadway. On the other hand, residents that work outside of the small community were looking forward to decreased commute times to their workplaces. The bypass opened on October 30, 2013. The City of Kalamazoo accepted jurisdiction of the trunklines within the city's downtown from MDOT in January 2019; M-43 was rerouted out of the city as a result. After the change, M-43 ran concurrently along US 131 from Oshtemo Township on the west side of Kalamazoo to Plainwell. Bus. US 131 in Kalamazoo was also truncated, and the BL I-94 overlap removed. On July 27, 2019, a roundabout was opened at the intersection of US 131 and M-186 just outside the village of Fife Lake in Grand Traverse County. Future Originally, MDOT and its predecessor agencies had planned to convert US 131 into a freeway all the way to Petoskey. They suggested adding the highway to the Interstate Highway System in the late 1960s, when the federal government took proposals for additions to the network of highways. While further northward extension of the freeway from Manton to Kalkaska and beyond was postponed by the department in the 1970s, and canceled \\"perhaps forever\\" in the early 1980s, MDOT made an attempt to revive the extension to Kalkaska in 2000. The proposal was ultimately abandoned when the year's transportation plan was finalized. A bridge replacement project over the Manistee River in 2009‚Äì10 ensured the end of further consideration by MDOT of the proposal. According to the local project director, \\"currently, the department has no plans [to expand the freeway]. Someday it may happen, but not in the foreseeable future.\\" A southerly extension of the freeway to or near the Indiana state line is still under study. Improvements to the US 131 corridor from Portage to the Indiana Toll Road have been underway for several years and although a late-2005 decision by MDOT to not pursue a new controlled-access route through St. Joseph County seemed to terminate the discussion, public outcry and backlash from local legislators forced the department to re-evaluate its decision. State House Speaker Craig DeRoche was critical of the original decision, citing the economic development benefit such a road would bring to the area in defense of the proposed freeway. The previous \\"no-build decision\\" was rescinded in April 2006. MDOT has begun a project to upgrade a segment of US 131 in St. Joseph County, home of one of the most dangerous roadway sections in Southwest Michigan for auto crashes. The final environmental impact statement for the project was published in mid-2008 and the preferred alternative consists of a two-lane road bypassing the village of Constantine. The new highway would maintain access to local roads via at-grade intersections, and the department would maintain jurisdiction of the old route through town. MDOT has stated that present traffic demands do not warrant the cost of a full freeway facility on a new alignment from the Indiana Toll Road to north of Three Rivers, stating that such a project would cost over $300 million (equivalent to $ in ) to build. Construction plans were placed on hold after an announcement in June 2009 as various proposals around the state, including the Constantine bypass, were shelved until funding issues could be resolved. In total, 137 road and bridge projects totaling $740 million were delayed to 2012 because the state could not match available federal funding to pay for the work. Memorial designations US 131 and its predecessors bears several memorial designations in addition to the Sidney Ouwinga Memorial Bypass near Cadillac. One of the oldest is the Mackinaw Trail, named after a former Indian trail that ran from Saginaw to Mackinaw City and Sault Ste. Marie. By 1915, the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US 131. The Mackinaw Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all-weather highway between Grand Rapids and Mackinaw City, using a logo incorporating a trout for the road. The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929, but the State Senate did not agree to the proposal. The official endorsement of the name came in 1959, after the opening of the Mackinac Bridge revitalized the idea.. During World War I, households would display a service flag if a family member was serving in the war. A blue star denoted a service member in action, and a gold star symbolized someone who died in the military. In St. Joseph County, the chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the American Legion wanted to honor the local fallen soldiers. Using the flags as inspiration, they planted 100 black walnut and four Norway spruce trees along the road south of Three Rivers. Dedicated on May 4, 1924, this tribute was named the Gold Star Memorial Highway and ran for along what is now US 131 south of Three Rivers.. In 1921, the section of highway south of Kalamazoo was named part of the Colgrove Highway. This designation included several other roads in the Lower Peninsula, all named in honor of Philip Colgrove, the first president of the Michigan Good Roads Association. Colgrove was also the Barry County prosecutor and a state senator in the late 19th century. No maps document the name, although the original law remains in records. The Michigan Legislature proposed a bill in 2000 that would have repealed the 1921 statute naming the Colgrove Highway, but the bill ultimately faded, sparing the name.. In the age of the auto trails, it was common for highways to be named rather than numbered. An attempt to create a trail such as the Lincoln Highway failed in Michigan. School children in 1926 from Anderson, Indiana, wanted to honor James Whitcomb Riley, the poet from the Hoosier State, with a highway that connected the country's summer and winter resort areas. The Michigan segment of the road running through the state was to follow what would later be US 131\\\\. The James Whitcomb Riley Association promoted the highway by painting white bands on telephone poles with the name of the road in orange letters during that August and September. However, the road in question was already named the Mackinaw Trail, and the association did not secure permission of the state highway commissioner, as was required by a 1919 Michigan law. The law made it illegal for any \\"association to delineate or mark any other routes or trails through the State of Michigan... unless the same shall be approved in writing by the State Highway Commissioner.\\". As a result, government officials refused to endorse the association's proposal, and Michigan was excluded from the highway. The efforts of the national association were stunted by the halted progress, and the highway was disbanded by December 1926. The Michigan Trail, another auto trail from the 1920s, \\"followed just about every major trunk line at that time in the Lower Peninsula and covered over a thousand miles [] of state highways.\\". The Michigan Trail started in Toledo, Ohio, and ran to Detroit; its branches extended to New Buffalo, Grand Rapids, and Port Huron. Other segments included US 131 between Kalamazoo and Petoskey, US 31 between New Buffalo and the Straits of Mackinac and a route between Port Huron and Big Rapids. The highway failed as a concept because it lacked focus, and many of the segments of roadway had already assigned names. The most recent name applied to US 131 is related to the first. Enacted in 2004, Public Act 138 added an additional name to the Mackinaw Trail from the M-66 junction near Kalkaska to Petoskey,. the \\"Green Arrow Route-Mackinaw Trail\\". Residents of the state have questioned the wisdom of having a \\"compound road name whose signboards [would] be nearly as long as the highway itself.\\". Historic bridges MDOT maintains a listing of historic bridges that includes two which formerly carried US 131\\\\. In 1913, the State Trunk Line Act required the highway department to build and maintain bridges at the state's expense if they were included in the nascent highway system. Among the first of these state-built structures is the Division Avenue‚ÄìPlaster Creek Bridge in Grand Rapids. The crossing is listed on the NRHP for its architectural and engineering significance. Built as Trunk Line Bridge No. 3 over Plaster Creek in 1914 by the MSHD, the span cost just over $6,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Division Avenue carried US 131 until the construction of the freeway through Grand Rapids in the 1960s. The bridge, a filled spandrel arch design, is , and was modified in 1935 to widen its deck from to the current . The structure was added to the NRHP on December 17, 1999. The second bridge listed by MDOT is the crossing of the Little Muskegon River for 190th Avenue in southern Mecosta County. Like the Plaster Creek bridge, this structure was also built by the MSHD under the Trunk Line Act of 1913. Built in 1916‚Äì17 the , , concrete through-girder bridge cost around $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to build. It was initially named Trunk Line Bridge No. 61. The span is the oldest concrete girder bridge designed by the MSHD.. US 131 followed 190th Avenue over the river until a realignment shifted the highway to another route in 1927.

The southern terminus of the route is at US 27 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The northern terminus is at Interstate 75 (I-75) near Grayling, Michigan. Since 1987, it has been the core of the annual World's Longest Yard Sale, also known as the Highway 127 Corridor Sale (127 Yard Sale), which now stretches from Addison, Michigan, to Gadsden, Alabama. The sale, held every August, was started to demonstrate that the older U.S. Highway System has something to offer that the Interstate Highway System does not. In Michigan, US 127 tripled in length in 2002, taking mileage from its parent, US 27\\\\. Route description =Tennessee= In Tennessee, US 127 traverses rural areas of the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Middle Tennessee and western East Tennessee. The route officially begins in the northern Chattanooga suburb of Red Bank at an interchange with US 27, where it overlaps Tennessee State Route 8. From there it runs primarily northwest as it passes Signal Mountain, and later Walden Ridge before entering Dunlap, where it turns northeast along Tennessee State Route 28. After TN 8 leaves at the interchange with TN 111, US 127/TN 28 follows through the Sequatchie Valley, passing through the city of Pikeville, then curves back to the northwest as it enters Crossville, only to return towards the northeast as it enters Jamestown. From that point on it returns towards the northwest one more time as it winds through the woods surrounding the Sgt. Alvin C. York State Historic Park. Finally in Static, the road runs along the Tennessee-Kentucky border where it makes a sharp turn at the northern terminus of TN 111 before entering Kentucky. =Kentucky= In Kentucky, US 127 is cosigned with US 42 through Cincinnati's Northern Kentucky suburbs until east of Warsaw, then passes south through Owenton. This was the road driven by Buddy Rich when he wrote \\"Blue Grass makes me Blue\\" in 1947. At the state capital of Frankfort, it becomes a four-lane highway, then skirts Lawrenceburg, Harrodsburg, and Danville. It enters the hilly Knobs Region at Junction City, where it becomes a two-lane route, and continues through Hustonville, crossing the drainage divide between the Kentucky and Green river watersheds and roughly following the scenic upper Green River valley through Casey County, crossing the river at Liberty. South of Dunnville it climbs onto the Eastern Pennyroyal Plateau and cuts through Russell Springs and Jamestown. It crosses Wolf Creek Dam, which creates Lake Cumberland. It runs very briefly with KY 90 north of Albany and crosses into Tennessee at Static. The new route through Clinton County includes a bypass west of Albany; the original plan for a more direct eastern route was abandoned because of historic and scenic concerns. In the county US 127 runs through sinkhole plains along the escarpment that marks the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau, creating scenic views. =Ohio= US 127 serves several cities and rural communities along the extreme western edge of Ohio, including Cincinnati, New Miami, Seven Mile, Somerville, Camden, Eaton, Greenville, Celina, Van Wert, Paulding and Bryan. In Cincinnati, it shares a short concurrency with its parent route, US 27, along with US 42. From there, it heads north through Fairfield and Hamilton. The highway is a four-lane, divided bypass around Greenville. US 127 crosses the Ohio Turnpike near West Unity, but does not intersect with it. It also joins with US 36 for about . The first city US 127 enters after leaving Kentucky is Cincinnati. The last municipality that US 127 goes through before reaching Michigan is West Unity. Except for Defiance County, US 127 passes through the county seats of all nine counties in Ohio that share a border with Indiana. It also traverses a portion of Fulton County before entering Michigan. In total, US 127 traverses across Ohio. =Michigan= US 127 through Lansing, Michigan. Much of the route is a four-lane freeway through this state. In Michigan, US 127 runs from the Ohio border south of Hudson north to the junction with I-75, south of Grayling, a distance of . The highway is the primary route connecting Lansing and central Michigan to Northern Michigan and the Mackinac Bridge; it serves the cities of Jackson, Lansing, and Clare. From the south side of Jackson northerly, it is mostly a four-lane freeway, except for the notable exception of a stretch from north of St. Johns to just south of Ithaca, where access to the road is not limited. Prior to 2002, US 127 ran from I-69 north of East Lansing southerly to the Ohio border near Hudson, a total of . From the Ohio border until Jackson, the highway follows the course (with minor deviations) of the Michigan Meridian used to survey Michigan in the early 19th century. That stretch is generally named Meridian Road. In the non-freeway sections of the route, it is known as Bagley Road. A proposed I-73 would incorporate US 127 between Jackson and Grayling. History =Southern terminus= US 127 originally terminated at Toledo when it was commissioned in 1926. At that time, the southern portion ran from Somerset to Toledo along the route of present-day U.S. Route 223. In 1930 the southern terminus moved to Cincinnati, and in 1958 it was extended to its present southern terminus at Chattanooga. =Northern terminus= The northern terminus of US 127 was in or near Lansing, Michigan, from its inception in 1926 to 2002. In 2002, the terminus was moved to an intersection with I-75 south of Grayling in Crawford County, Michigan, replacing all of US 27 north of Lansing.

It leads from Calle de Alcal√°, close to Plaza de Cibeles, to Plaza de Espa√±a. The street, sometimes referred to as the \\"Spanish Broadway\\", is one of the city's most important shopping areas, with a large number of hotels and large movie theatres; however, since the late 2000s, many of these theatres have been replaced by shopping centres. The Gran V√≠a serves as a showcase of early 20th-century revival architecture, with architectural styles ranging from Vienna Secession style, Plateresque, Neo-Mud√©jar, Art Deco, among others. History The Metropolis Building located in Gran V√≠a and Alcal√° Street, 2014 = Conception = In the mid 19th century, Madrid's urban planners determined that a new thoroughfare should be created, connecting the Calle de Alcal√° with the Plaza de Espa√±a - similar to Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The project called for the demolition of many buildings in the centre of the city, earning the project the name of 'an axe blow on the map'. Decades after the first plans were revealed, ground-breaking and construction tarried causing the media to ridicule the project, cynically calling it the 'Gran V√≠a' or 'Great Way' or 'Big Way'. Finally in 1904 it was approved and construction started in 1910. The last part of the street was completed in 1929. At the end of March in 2018, the city council of Madrid began the pedestrianization of a lane in each direction in a plan to extend sidewalks and remodel some squares around the street. This was related to the introduction of Madrid Central, a Residential Priority Area, later in 2018. = Names = The Gran V√≠a of Madrid has had many historical names, both official and unofficial. Conception divided the road in three parts. The first one was built between 1910 and 1917 and was called Calle del Conde de Pe√±alver (\\"Count of Pe√±alver Street\\"). The second part of the project commenced on 1917 and concluded on 1921. It was named Calle de Pi y Margall (\\"Francisco Pi y Margall Street\\") after a deceased politician. Construction of the third and last part of the road did not start until 1925 and was called Calle Eduardo Dato Iradier (\\"Eduardo Dato Street\\") after another politician. Three months before the Spanish Civil War began, the Second Spanish Republic changed some street names under leftist influence. The two first parts of the avenue were called Avenida de la C.N.T. (\\"C.N.T. Avenue\\"). When the Civil War started, the avenue was renamed Avenida de Rusia (\\"Russia Avenue\\") due to the support of this country for the Spanish Republic, but soon its name would be changed to Avenida de la Uni√≥n Sovi√©tica (\\"Soviet Union Avenue\\"). However, the avenue was popularly nicknamed as Avenida de los obuses (\\"howitzer avenue\\") because of the continued bombardments by the Nationalist forces loyal to Francisco Franco. The reason for these attacks in this area was that the \\"Edificio de Telef√≥nica\\" (the Spanish phone company) is in this street, due to its height it served the aviation as a reference point during shellings. Just after the end of the war when the rebels entered Madrid, they renamed the road Avenida de Jos√© Antonio (\\"Jos√© Antonio Avenue\\") after one of their greatest political figures, founder of the fascist party, Falange. It wouldn't be until 1981, under Spain democracy, when the socialist mayor restored the names of 27 streets and the avenue was simply named Gran V√≠a (\\"Great Way\\"). Notable buildings Telef√≥nica headquarters in Gran V√≠a, 2011. The new road created opportunities for architects, who had the opportunity to create large buildings in the latest architectural styles. The first eye-catching building starting from the Calle de Alcal√° is the most famous of all, the Edificio Metr√≥polis or Metropolis Building. The landmark was built between 1907 and 1911 by the father and son architects Jules and Raymond F√©vrier. The original statue, La Uni√≥n y el F√©nix was replaced in 1975 by a statue of a winged Goddess Victory. A bit further along the Gran V√≠a, on the left-hand side is another landmark, the Edificio Grassy, another corner building with a small tower, built-in 1917. Visible from here is the tower of the Telef√≥nica Building, the first European skyscraper; it was built between 1926 and 1929 for the Spanish telecommunications company. The 88-metre (290 ft) building was the tallest in Madrid and was designed by the American Louis S. Weeks. Others buildings include: Plazas Hotel Las Letras (left), Casino Militar (right), 2018. Farther towards the Plaza de Espa√±a, the Gran V√≠a crosses a small square, the Plaza del Callao, named after the battle of El Callao. This square is the heart of cinematic Madrid, with about six movie theatres. One of them, the Capitol, is located in a beautiful Art Deco building. However, changes in building rules have allowed the reform of the theatres into more lucrative shopping centres. The last part of the Gran V√≠a, constructed between 1925 and 1929 leads to the Plaza de Espa√±a, a large square dominated by two skyscrapers built in the 1950s, the symmetric Edificio Espa√±a and the Torre de Madrid. Here the Gran V√≠a becomes the Calle Princesa, leading north to the Arco de la Victoria. In media *La Gran V√≠a (1886) by Federico Chueca is a satirical zarzuela in which the anthropomorphized streets of Madrid complain about how the city will lose by their destruction and replacement by the new project. *In a scene of the √Ålex de la Iglesia's 1995 sci-fi/horror film The Day of the Beast, Santiago Segura hangs above Gran V√≠a from the iconic neon advertisement for Schweppes on Edificio Carri√≥n/Capitol. *The opening scene of Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 film Open Your Eyes famously features a shocking view of the Gran V√≠a completely empty of vehicles and people. This was filmed in the early morning of a weekend in August 1996, and the street had to be intermittently closed off to traffic for six hours to achieve it. This shot was later recreated for the American remake, Vanilla Sky, at Times Square, New York. *Gran Via is also the title of the 1995 album by Matt Bianco. *The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi on Gran Via. * At the end of Georges Conchon's 1959 novel \\"La Corrida de la victoire\\" (published in English as \\"The Hollow Victory\\") the protagonist - a former soldier of the Spanish Republic, fleeing Spain after Franco's victory - takes the quixotic and defiant gesture of openly walking one last time along the Gran V√≠a in August 1939, at a considerable risk to his life since captured Republicans were at this time often shot out of hand.

After several more gigs around Finland, a short visit to Norway (one gig and a party/sleepover at black metal band Mayhem's house) with their second drummer Mika Arnkil (on leave from Antidote), the band broke up in 1990. Koivusaari went on to play in Amorphis. In 2012 Svart Records released all of their recorded material on CD and vinyl. The Completely Vulgar compilation consists of the band's demo and EP as partially remastered versions, as well as live recording from 1990. Double LP version also has lo-fi rehearsal recordings. Both versions include two previously unreleased tracks. In 2013 the band reformed for three performances, with all original members, with the exception of the new drummer Rainer Tuomikanto. They played three shows, first at Bar Loose in Helsinki (under alias Bob Horrence) with Deathchain. The other performances were at Tuska Open Air Metal Festival and Hammer Open Air festival. The performance at Tuska festival was recorded and released as Totally Vulgar ‚Äì Live at Tuska 2013 live album in 2017, again by Svart Records. The band formed to play in support of the live album's release, with Waltteri V√§yrynen as drummer. They played a short four date tour of Finland with Demilich and later a Nummirock festival appearance. In early 2018 the band announced they had written some new music and made an agreement with Svart Records, regarding the release of an EP later in the year. They performed some of the new material at concerts on 10.2. at Torvi Bar in Lahti and 24.3. at Kuudes Linja club in Helsinki, supported by Corpse Molester Cult.

Ground substance is active in the development, movement, and proliferation of tissues, as well as their metabolism. Additionally, cells use it for support, water storage, binding, and a medium for intercellular exchange (especially between blood cells and other types of cells). Ground substance provides lubrication for collagen fibers. The components of the ground substance vary depending on the tissue. Ground substance is primarily composed of water and large organic molecules, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. GAGs are polysaccharides that trap water, giving the ground substance a gel-like texture. Important GAGs found in ground substance include hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. With the exception of hyaluronic acid, GAGs are bound to proteins called proteoglycans. Glycoproteins are proteins that attach components of the ground substance to one another and to the surfaces of cells. Components of the ground substance are secreted by fibroblasts. Usually it is not visible on slides, because it is lost during staining in the preparation process. Link proteins such as vinculin, spectrin and actomyosin stabilize the proteoglycans and organize elastic fibers in the ECM. Changes in the density of ground substance can allow collagen fibers to form aberrant cross-links. Loose connective tissue is characterized by few fibers and cells, and a relatively large amount of ground substance. Dense connective tissue has a smaller amount of ground substance compared to the fibrous material. The meaning of the term has evolved over time.

All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. =Important sights= Near Pedong are the ruins of Damsang Gadi, a historical fort built in 1690 AD by the Lepchas. It was at the centre of the long- standing feud with the Dukpas of Bhutan. Later, it was used to ward off the forces of the British East India Company. After the Anglo-Bhutan War of 1864 AD, the fort fell into decay. The Damsang fort (Damsang Gadi) is the only fort in the entire district of Darjeeling. It was home to the last Lepcha King- Gyabo Achuk as the Lepcha people are the real natives of this place. Another highlight of the town is the Cross Hill, placed by priest Fr. Augustine Desgodins in 1882 AD on his way to Tibet. In the Tibet Mission a lot of Evangelists lost their lives or never came back from Tibet. Fr. Augustine Desgodins in due memory of them erected a cross at a vantage point facing Tibet directly with a hope that someday the evangelists may return. It is considered to have miraculous powers and is a pilgrimage site for the local Christians. The Cross Hill is located at such a point wherein the view of the facing mountains is magnificent. From here one can get a glimpse of Tibet and the People's Republic of Chinese border. It is a perfect sunset point.

The measure restored the right of adopted adults who were born in Oregon to access their original birth certificates. The measure passed with 609,268 votes in favor, 454,122 against. It was immediately challenged by several birth mothers who had put children up for adoption, which delayed instituting the measure for a year and a half. Text ::Upon receipt of a written application to the state registrar, any adopted person 21 years of age and older born in the state of Oregon shall be issued a certified copy of his/her unaltered, original and unamended certificate of birth in the custody of the state registrar, with procedures, filing fees, and waiting periods identical to those imposed upon non-adopted citizens of the State of Oregon pursuant to ORS 432.120 and 432.146. Contains no exceptions. Legal Challenges On December 1, 1998, a group of birth mothers, represented by attorney Franklin Hunsaker, filed a lawsuit to seek an injunction. Marion County Oregon circuit court judge Albin W. Norblad granted an injunction halting the implementation of Measure 58. Judge Norblad later recused himself from the case and was replaced by Judge Paul Lipscomb. In his decision, Judge Lipscomb upheld Measure 58, ruling the Oregon Constitution held no promise of secrecy to women who gave their children up for adoption. \\"Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate either any contractual right to absolute privacy or confidentiality, or any impermissible impairment of any such rights.\\" The Oregon Court of Appeals issued a temporary injunction on July 30, 1999.

In 2004 they performed unannounced eastern European shows under the names Septagon, Undecagon, Duodecagon, Enneacontagon, and Hecatommyriagon. Black Triage Their second album Black Triage was released in 2008. Impose described it as \\"brutal\\" and compared it to Burial. To complement the visceral music, the text inside the CD booklet was penned by the filmmaker Godfrey Reggio of Koyaanisqatsi fame. Three music videos were produced for the album and debuted at the 2007 American Film Institute Festival, which called the band 'a bold experimental vision'. Notable songs Two Teargas & Plateglass songs were used for trailers for the movie X-Men: The Last Stand. The song \\"Plague Burial\\" was used for the theatrical trailer, and the song \\"Book of Black Valentines\\" was used for the non- theatrical trailer. \\"Plague Burial\\" was also used in the trailer for Beowulf (2007). Several songs have been heard in CSI, CSI New York and CSI Miami. The song \\"A Uniquely Hostile Place\\" was used in the Steven Spielberg produced television show United States of Tara.

She was coach of Australia from 2003 to 2011, ending her coaching career with the Diamonds on 67 victories from 89 Tests ‚Äî a success rate of 75 per cent. She was replaced as coach of Australia by Lisa Alexander. She was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for her services to the sport. Early career Norma Plummer began her career in 1967 and represented Australian Diamonds in 1972 with who she spent a decade which includes the win at the 1975 World Netball Championships in New Zealand. She had a long and successful career as an Australian representative netballer, including a four- Test stint as national captain in 1978. After some time as playing coach of her state league team, Plummer embarked on a successful coaching career, coaching the Victorian state team to several victories at the national netball championships which was followed by her retirement from the team in 1982. and coaching the Melbourne Pumas in the Esso Superleague/Mobil League. After the Mobil League was disbanded in favour of the new Commonwealth Bank Trophy, Plummer became the founding coach of the new Melbourne Phoenix team, which took many of the players from the former Pumas, and successfully coached them to the inaugural premiership. She was also appointed coach of the Australian youth team and took them to several successes. She subsequently resigned as coach of the Phoenix at the beginning of the 1999 season in order to take up a position as head netball coach at the Australian Institute of Sport. While in this role, she was integral in the campaign to add the AIS Canberra Darters to the national competition. National coach After several years as coach of the national youth team, and having been rumoured for the head national coach position since the late 1980s, Plummer was the obvious favourite when Jill McIntosh resigned in July 2003, and subsequently took the reins of the national team in late August. In her nearly three years as coach for the Australian team, she has retained her prior reputation as a hard coach willing to axe even star players if not performing, and remains widely respected, even with a downturn in the team's fortunes during 2005. In June 2006 after the silver medal in March at the Commonwealth Games Norma Plummer led her young team to victory in all Test Match Series in 2006 & 2007 and in November 2007 won the World Championships in Auckland, New Zealand. In 2008 Plummer's team Australian Diamonds, had beaten Silver Ferns 53 to 51 at the Horncastle Arena and two years later won a gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi. She also coached Australian national team at the 2011 Netball World Championships in Singapore. Norma has announced that she will be coaching the West Coast Fever for season 2012. In June 2015 Plummer became the head coach of the South Africa national netball team. During the 2013 Australia Day honours, Plummer was appointed a Member in the General Division of the Order of Australia. In 2014, after a 66‚Äì65 loss by her team West Coast Fever, which was playing in Dunedin at that time, a resident of the city had made death threats towards her on her personal webpage. In 2018, Plummer had revealed that although she doesn't have a signed contract with the Netball South Africa, she will lead its national team to greatness at the 2019 Netball World Cup in Liverpool. She stepped down as the coach of South African team following the 2019 World Cup where South Africa ended up at fourth position. References External links *Speaker biography ICMI: Norma Plummer.

It was located at the western end of the Edinburgh-Bathgate Line. The station was 18¬Ω miles (30 km) west of Edinburgh.  History  The station was opened in 1986 to serve Bathgate when the rail service from Edinburgh was re-introduced by British Rail. Next to the station was Bathgate goods yard. The yard was used to store and unload freight trains carrying new cars. This yard was located to the south of the present station. The goods yard - later the Bathgate car terminal - was moved slightly east in 1996 as the original site of the yard was occupied by various retail outlets. The 1986 station was sited on the location of the original Bathgate station, which became the town's goods station when Bathgate Upper opened (see link to OS 25-inch 1854 map).  Developments  In 2005, the Scottish Executive declared that in line with plans to upgrade the unfinished part of the A8 to motorway standard, public transport links between Glasgow and Edinburgh must also improve. The closed section of line between the 1989 Drumgelloch station and Bathgate would be rebuilt as a double tracked electrified railway, termed the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link. This resulted in the closure of this station to be replaced by a new station to the south east on the former Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway.  Closure  On 16 October 2010, the station was closed at the end of the day's service, with the new Bathgate station opening on Monday 18 October.  Service  At the time of closure in 2010, there was a half-hourly service from Bathgate to Edinburgh Monday to Saturdays with an hourly service on Sundays.

Woodland R-IV School district, 30 F. Supp. 2d 1175 (E.D. Mo. 1998), was the first case in United States law to rule on the right of students to speak off-campus in an online forum, and as result of this case, it is often cited in other off-campus online speech cases. It was decided in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern Division. Facts The complainant was Brandon Beussink, \\"by and through his parent and next friend,\\" Nadean Beussink, a junior at Woodland High School in Marble Hill, Missouri. In early February 1998, Beussink created a personal website on the Internet, Beussink's own personal computer and no school facilities or resources. There he made non-defamatory but highly critical remarks of administrators and their actions at Woodland High School, using vulgar language \\"to convey his opinion regarding the teachers, the principal and the school's own homepage.\\" A student who had accessed the site during school hours, with the intention of getting Beussink in trouble, showed it to a member of Woodland's faculty. The criticism upset the teacher, and consequently, the principal of the school was informed. During fourth period on the day the principal was informed, Brandon received a five-day suspension, citing the 'offensive nature' of Beussink's site as the rationale. During seventh period of the same day, Buessink's suspension was increased from 5 to 10 days. Because of the school's unauthorised absence policy, and in conjunction with Beussink's previous 8.5 days of unexcused absences, his 10-day suspension resulted in his grades being dropped by 8.5 grade levels. Beussink brought his case to the U.S. District court, who ruled in his favor. The presiding judge, Rodney W. Sippel, said that the suspension was unconstitutional, and breached Beussink's first amendment rights. Sippel ruled that the high school officials did not show that the suspension \\"was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint.\\" The school was enjoined from using the ten-day suspension in applying its absenteeism policy to Beussink's grades; it was also prohibited to restrict Beussink's using his home computer to repost his webpage.

Publication history The Horsemen of Apocalypse are first mentioned in X-Factor #10 (Nov. 1986), and make their full appearance in X-Factor #15 (April 1987) where they were created by writer Louise Simonson and artist Walt Simonson. The first comic- book characters of this name were an unrelated team of aliens from the race known as the Axi-Tun that attacked Earth in ancient and modern times. They appeared in Giant Size Fantastic Four #3 (Nov. 1974). Fictional biography The group consists of four individuals (usually mutants) that have been genetically altered and mentally conditioned to serve the ancient mutant, Apocalypse, either willingly or forcibly. They are enhanced or endowed with new abilities, and are always given the same titles based upon the biblical Four Horsemen (Death, Famine, Pestilence (replacing the biblical Conquest), and War). While Apocalypse has empowered other individuals to do his bidding, the Four Horsemen remain his elite minions, always playing a key role in his plans. Before Apocalypse assembled his first modern incarnation (according to date of real world publication) of Horsemen, it was revealed that there were other, lesser known groups of Horsemen. =1st incarnation= The first incarnation of the Horsemen of Apocalypse dates from ancient times, when Krakoa was part of a greater land called Okkara. When suddenly Okkara was split by a force wielding the Twilight Sword which divided the island into two creatures, Krakoa and Arakko, Apocalypse and his first horsemen fought the invaders. In the end, they were responsible for the sealing of the chasm. The horsemen were sealed on the other side of the chasm alongside Arakko, to guard the opening and ensure it never opened again. =11th century incarnation= Having special fondness for the originals, Apocalypse assembled a new incarnation of the Horsemen during the 11th century and sent them to kill a pagan named Folkbern Logan in medieval London. To fill the role of Pestilence, Apocalypse recruited Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds, a mutant that greatly resembles Orb with his arms replaced by wings which allowed him to fly. For the role of Famine, Apocalypse had chosen a Native American female. For the role of War, Apocalypse had recruited a mutant that resembled a mummy. For the role of Death, Apocalypse recruited a mutant who seemed to possess a gas-like body which allowed him to fly and wears a robe and cloak that covers his entire body like a grim reaper. Thor comes to Folkbern's aid and kills the Horsemen of Apocalypse single-handedly.Uncanny Avengers #6. Marvel Comics. =15th century incarnation= In X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1, Apocalypse began assembling a new cadre of Horsemen as he had chosen a new Horseman to fill the position of War. This Horseman led the Riders of the Dark, an army of Apocalyse's followers and rode among them as well. This army was so strong and powerful that some were led to believe that they were just a myth to scare soldiers even before their first battle. Possessing a horse clad in armor that he rode into battle and a pair of battle axes which he could link at the butt and throw, turning them into a sort of bladed boomerang that seemed to return to him, War single-handedly defeated the pre-vampire Dracula's army as well as Dracula himself. =First modern incarnation= Fall of Mutants The original Four Horsemen of Apocalypse. Panel from X-Factor #24. Art by Walt Simonson. In the 20th century, Apocalypse recruits Plague, a member of the Morlocks, during the \\"Mutant Massacre\\" to fill the role of Pestilence. He approaches ex-soldier Abraham Lincoln Kieros and grants him the position of War. An anorexic girl named Autumn Rolfson is Apocalypse's third choice and Autumn is given the position of Famine. Apocalypse afterwards saved the dewinged Angel from his sabotaged, exploding plane and chooses him to be his fourth and final Horseman, Death. The Four Horsemen were forced to battle one another for leadership, and Death emerges victorious. In their first battle against X-Factor, the Horsemen were nearly defeated until Death appeared, shocking his former comrades. While X-Factor is strapped down, the Four Horsemen are sent out by Apocalypse to destroy New York City. Meanwhile, Caliban confronts Apocalypse and asks for power to avenge his fellow Morlocks. X-Factor frees themselves and take on the Four Horsemen; Pestilence is accidentally slain by Power Pack in the battle and Archangel comes back to his senses after assuming he killed his former comrade, Iceman. Apocalypse retreats with his remaining Horsemen and the newly recruited Caliban. X-Cutioner's Song While Apocalypse heals from his recent defeat on the moon, Mister Sinister disguises himself as Apocalypse and orders the Horsemen War, Famine, and Caliban, who was transformed by Apocalypse and replaced Angel as Death, to capture Jean Grey and Cyclops. The X-Men later defeat the Horsemen when they discover their hideout. Hulk After a battle with the X-Men in their mansion, Hulk is taken by Apocalypse and becomes the new incarnation of War, being supplied with weaponry and a helmet that shields Hulk from his father's abusive and severely distracting spirit. Apocalypse set Hulk against the Juggernaut to test the latter's strength. Hulk was able to stop and overcome the Juggernaut, after being empowered by energy from Franklin Richards' \\"Heroes Reborn\\" pocket universe. He likewise overloaded the Absorbing Man, but came to his senses after he had injured his friend Rick Jones. =Second incarnation= The Twelve Second incarnation of the Four Horsemen: War (Deathbird), Pestilence (Caliban) and Famine (Ahab). Panel from X-Men #97. Pencils by Alan Davis. During \\"The Twelve\\" saga, Apocalypse selected a new group of Horsemen to collect the chosen mutants written in Destiny's Diary. This new group featured the cybernetic mutant Ahab as Famine, the Shi'ar Deathbird as War, and the Morlock, Caliban, this time as Pestilence. As the Horseman of Death, Apocalypse had abducted Wolverine and replaced him with a Skrull to prevent his absence being noted. Apocalypse then pitted Wolverine against Sabretooth. The winner of the battle would become his Horseman of Death. Believing that his healing factor would prevent Apocalypse from turning him into a horseman, Wolverine defeats Sabretooth, and Apocalypse strips the adamantium from the latter and bonds it to Wolverine's skeleton.Wolverine vol. 2, #145. Marvel Comics. As Death, Wolverine was sent to destroy the Mannites, a group of artificially-created children, since Apocalypse believed that their presence was a threat to the mutants existence. He partially destroys a captured Bastion and then attempt to kill the children, but one of the Mannites, Nina was able to request the assistance of the X-Men and after a brief battle, Death kills his Skrull imposter. When Death captured Mikhail Rasputin and failed to teleport out with him, he was chased into the Morlock Tunnels by the X-Men. He battled them and regained his memory, thanks to the efforts of Jubilee, Shadowcat, Archangel, and Psylocke. The rest of the Horsemen are teleported to another dimension by Mikhail. =Third incarnation= Blood of Apocalypse Following the House of M and M-Day, Apocalypse resurrected, assembling a new cadre of Horsemen with the purpose of wiping out 90% of the baseline human population. Apocalypse's new Horsemen were Gazer as War, Sunfire as Famine, Polaris as Pestilence, and Gambit as Death. Gazer was saved from death and forced to battle an archaeologist for the mantle of War, which he won with the aid of Apocalypse's scribe, Ozymandias. Both Sunfire, who had lost his legs at the hands of Lady Deathstrike and his powers to Rogue, and Polaris, an M-Day victim, were captured, and reluctantly altered into Famine and Pestilence, respectively. Gambit, however, submitted himself willingly to be transformed into Death, as he had come to believe Apocalypse could be helpful to the mutant cause, though he would need to be watched. Sunfire was able to break free of Apocalypse's control with the help of Emma Frost, although he was weakened by the experience, and Gambit retained a large portion of his former self, stating to Apocalypse, \\"I'm both Death and Gambit\\", and he also remembered his love for Rogue as he could not bring himself to kill her. Polaris was knocked out by Iceman in the final battle. She was abandoned, saved by Havok, and freed from her brainwashing by the X-Men. Gazer died defending Apocalypse, having been stabbed in the back by Ozymandias.X-Men #182-187. Marvel Comics. =The Final Horsemen= When the Clan Akkaba finally resurrects En Sabah Nur, albeit in the form of a child, it is revealed that centuries ago Apocalypse had created the self-proclaimed \\"Final Horsemen\\". This cadre of Horsemen had been assembled one by one through time by Apocalypse and Ozymandias and would only be awoken when all other approaches had failed. They comprise the following members: * Decimus Furius - Collected during the 3rd Century, he is the son of a philosopher that was originally alive in Rome during the 200s. When his father committed suicide and his mother died shortly after, he was left homeless, without any money. While slowly starving to death in an alley, he transformed into his mutant self, the mythological Minotaur. When he was seen, the human civilians attempted to kill him. He slaughtered dozens before being brought down. Eventually, after being imprisoned for years, he was offered freedom, providing he was able to defeat all others in the arena. With his axe, he slaughtered all who opposed him. He was then worshipped as the Dark God Minotaur. He was found by Apocalypse and Ozymandias and he was appointed as War. Along with immense strength and durability, War's axe seems to psionically infect all it touches with a berserker rage and a cold thirst for destruction. His hide seems to have a resemblance to that of stone that makes him look like a statue when not moving. Decimus was later killed by the Apocalypse Twins.Uncanny Avengers #7. Marvel Comics. * Sanjar Javeed - Collected during the 4th Century, he is the bastard son and servant of the once king of Persia Shapur II. When the King could not let out that he had this son, Sanjar turned to thievery to get the attention of his father. However, this was when Sanjar's powers developed. He gained an ailment aura that could transmit a spectrum of terminal diseases depending on what variety of metal he touches. He began to poison the entire kingdom by spreading diseases through the stolen treasures. On his deathbed King Shapur named his son \\"The Seraph of Death\\". Soon Sanjar was collected by Apocalypse as his horseman, Death. Sanjar was killed by Deathlok while X-Force tried to stop Archangel from destroying the human race. * Jeb Lee - Collected during the 19th Century, he is a Confederate spy that fought during the American Civil War. He marched behind enemy lines disguised as a Union drummer, gathering information. After the war he returned home, mistakenly wearing his Union uniform. The Confederates believed him to be a traitor and burned his family alive in front of him. This stimulated his latent mutant powers, the ability to use percussive sound to create a bioauditory cancer, a \\"living sound\\" that feeds on the flesh of those who hear it. He was approached by Apocalypse and Ozymandias and appointed as Famine. Famine was later captured by X-Force and tortured by Deathlok for many hours while his host took control, revealing the location of Archangel to the team. Wolverine then cut off his hands, effectively removing his ability to use his powers. He later received artificial replacement hands,Uncanny Avengers #5. Marvel Comics. but was killed by the Apocalypse Twins. * Ichisumi - Collected during the 19th Century, she's a geisha that first lived in Kumamoto, Japan in the year 1893 AD. Ichisumi was jealous of all the more beautiful and intelligent women around her; as she suffered from a severe inferiority complex. Her father was a samurai who would get mad whenever she would fail. Stemming from her repressed rage and the disapproval of her father, she savagely ravaged the other geisha's after releasing a swarm of \\"yume beetles\\" from her mouth. The beetles consume thoughts and memories along with flesh and Ichisumi gains these when the beetles return to her. This is when Ichisumi's powers first manifested leading to her \\"collection\\" by Apocalypse, as his Pestilence. Pestilence was later seen in some intimate moments with Archangel who assigned her to guard Psylocke. She was later defeated by Psylocke when she stabbed Ichisumi through the mouth with her own parasol. Pestilence was later revealed to be pregnant with Archangel's child which apparently will be the new Apocalypse. She has since given birth to twins, Eimin and Uriel, known as the Apocalypse Twins. * Psylocke - Chosen during the 21st Century by Archangel to replace Sanjar Javeed. Archangel used the Celestial tool known as the Death Seed to transform Betsy into the new Horseman of Death but her time as a Horseman lasts only for a very short time since she was freed from Archangel's control by the Jean Grey of Earth-295. =Fifth incarnation= The Four Horsemen of Death As part of the Marvel NOW! event, a new incarnation of Horsemen of Apocalypse appeared, all dead characters resurrected by the Apocalypse Twins.Uncanny Avengers #9 and sent after a key member of the Avengers Unity Squad that they have some personal ties to. Its members being: * Banshee - Resurrected by the use of a Death Seed, he was sent after Havok (the brother of his killer Vulcan). * Daken - Resurrected by the use of a Death Seed, he was naturally sent after his father Wolverine. * Grim Reaper - Resurrected by the use of a Death Seed, he targeted his brother Wonder Man. * The Sentry - Resurrected by the use of a Death Seed and was sent after his killer Thor.Uncanny Avengers #10. Marvel Comics. Their goal is to destroy Earth and teleport all mutants to Planet X.Uncanny Avengers #19 Although this plan succeeds, the Avengers Unity Squad are able to undo their victory by transferring their minds into the body of their past selves after the Horsemen's victory, providing Rogue with sufficient power to force the Celestial away while her teammates confront Daken, the Reaper and Banshee, while also resulting in Sentry's Horseman programming being broken. While Sentry takes the dead body of the Celestial Executioner into deep space somewhere far away from Earth, Daken and Grim Reaper get away while Banshee ends up in the X-Men's custody as Beast concludes that healing Banshee of the Death Seed energy that made him a Horseman of Death will take years as well as highly advanced technology.Uncanny Avengers #22. Marvel Comics. =Sixth incarnation= Apocalypse Wars When Cerebra detected the sudden appearance of six hundred new mutant signatures in Tokyo, Storm sent Colossus and his team of young mutants ‚Äì composed of Anole, Ernst, Glob, and No-Girl ‚Äì to investigate, only to learn that the signatures was the work of the Sugar Man who had genetically engineered six hundred mutant embryos in total isolation from the Terrigen Mists and planned to send them to the future, where they would be safe from the M-Pox caused by the Mists and would grow to become the next generation of mutants, with him as their leader. Sugar Man was about to teleport the ark and himself to the future when Colossus and the young X-Men arrived. Their interference resulted in Sugar Man being separated from his ark and their teleportation along the ark to the future. Soon afterwards, the X-Men arrived and, upon discovering what had happened, used Cerebra to track and follow Colossus and his team through the timestream. Arriving a thousand years into Earth's future, the X-Men found themselves in a destroyed New York City. The X-Men soon found their young members, but Colossus wasn't with them anymore, and they were somewhat different as they had arrived some time before Storm's team. They were in possession of the ark containing the mutant embryos and were also protecting it. When the older X-Men asked what had happened to Colossus, Cerebra warned them of the incoming threat: the Horsemen of Apocalypse which was composed of Deadpool, the Venom Symbiote, a female version of Moon Knight and Colossus himself after he had taken the place of Man-Thing.Extraordinary X-Men #8. Marvel Comics.Extraordinary X-Men #9. Marvel Comics. While several X-Men battled Colossus, Deadpool and the Venom Symbiote, Nightcrawler took Storm to the interior of Apocalypse's Pyramid, only to be ambushed by Moon Knight, but Nightcrawler quickly dealt with her by throwing her into a pit full of spikes they almost fell into while exploring the pyramid. At the top of the pyramid, Storm and Nightcrawler met Apocalypse, who revealed to them that the planet they are on, dubbed Omega World, was his body and him its heart, with his Horsemen functioning like antibodies. Apocalypse also revealed he had already destroyed the ark, which led Nightcrawler to stab him in the back while he fought Storm. With Apocalypse fatally wounded, Omega World started to crumble.Extraordinary X-Men #11. Marvel Comics. After defeating Deadpool and Venom, the X-Men tried to take Colossus down, but were no match for him. Only Magik, who had just arrived to rescue them, was able to knock Colossus out. Seeing Apocalypse as the only person capable of transforming Colossus back to normal, Storm took him with them back to the present, but he teleported Colossus away as soon as they arrived in X-Haven. Somewhere else, Colossus was found by Clan Akkaba and revealed to be the Horseman of War.Extraordinary X-Men #12. Marvel Comics. Simultaneously in the present, there is a new group of Uncanny X-Men which is led by Magneto and includes Psylocke, Monet St. Croix, a reformed Sabretooth, and a newly re-emergent Archangel who seems to have been rendered a responsively inert drone, though, under Psylocke's psychic leash, Archangel became a heavy hitter in Magneto's X-Men, the group is also secretly backed by Mystique and Fantomex. After investigating a rash of mutant healer murders perpetrated by a long thought dead old foe whose talents had been hired out by an as of yet unknown benefactor, both Magnus and Elizabeth eventually discover a hidden Clan Akkaba base hidden under a religious rally orchestrated by \\"Angel\\" (the new person Warren became after being stabbed by the Celestial Life Seed), who in turn was being manipulated by both the clan's lord and the mercenary groups backer Genocide. As it turns out Angel had made a deal with Genocide and the Clan Akkaba to ensure that he would never become the Dark Angel again, and so they were able to split apart Angel from his Archangel persona into separate bodies; however Archangel's mind was altered during the process and, as a result, reduced him to little more than a mindless drone. It is also revealed that Genocide had been using \\"Angel\\"'s T.O. infected wings to create an army of clones modeled after his horseman Persona dubbing them his Death-Flight; Techno-Organic winged Archangels to be led by Angel's fused Archangel self in order to raze the world in his pursuit of Darwinism via culling the tainted flesh.Uncanny X-Men vol 4 #9. Marvel Comics. Psylocke attacked the Death-Flight to protect the citizens of Green Ridge, and was eventually joined by Fantomex, Mystique and Magneto, who had just killed Genocide. Magneto and Psylocke then watched as Angel and Archangel merged with all their clones to create a new being. This new Archangel was unsure of who or what he now was, but was determined to find out. He swore off all violence and returned with Magneto's X-Men to their base in the Savage Land. =The First incarnation returns= Following the transformation of Krakoa into a sovereign nation state for mutants, Apocalypse traveled to the island and eventually revealed to those present more of his past history with Krakoa. Later a mysterious island known as Arak Coral appeared off the southern coast of Krakoa and eventually both landmasses merged into one. With Arak Coral came also the High Summoner of Arakko, who was revealed to be the son of Apocalypse's first Horsemen of War.X-Men Vol. 5 #12. Marvel Comics. The Summoner pleads to Apocalypse to save them from their enemy and in his efforts to recover Arakko and his horsemen, Apocalypse calls a meeting with his fellows Externals inside the Eternal Caldera on the Arak Coral. Thanks to Rictor, Apocalypse murders Crule, Saul, Nicodemus and Candra, and with the aid of Selene, Gideon and Absalom sacrificed their corpses to create the Krakoan side of the External Gate. With Excalibur planting the partner Gateway in Otherworld, Apocalypse successfully secured the large gate connecting Krakoa and Otherworld. X of Swords Later it is discovered that the first incarnation of the Horsemen are actually the biological children of Apocalypse and his wife Genesis, who was also sent with Arakko.X of Swords - Creation #1. Marvel Comics. Following that, Apocalypse went to the Summoner and directed him to the portal to Otherworld where he could return to Arakko, while being accompanied by Unus and Banshee. However, what Apocalypse didn't expected was that this was all an elaborated plan created by his own children so they could return and overthrow Krakoa with their fellow Arakki mutants and Daemon army. Apocalypse himself was soon attacked and critically injured by his daughter War, being forced to retreat back to Krakoa to heal their wounds and prepare for war between the two group. Other versions =Last Horsemen of Apocalypse= During Moira MacTaggert's 9th life, it is revealed that after humanity united with the Sentinels to form the Man-Machine Ascendancy which created an extinction war across planet Earth, Apocalypse leads the last Mutant survivors and chose four of them to be his Last Horsemen which are: * Wolverine as the Horseman of War, a pureblood mutant, whose mutant healing factor has allowed him to live for centuries. * Xorn as the Horseman of Death, another pureblood mutant. He has a singularity in his head, which seems to have allowed him to live a longer than normal life. Or it could have to do with Apocalypse‚Äôs genetic modifications. * North as the Horseman of Pestilence, a \\"Chimera\\" mutant which is a hybrid soldier highly effective grown by Mr. Sinister's Mutant breeding program from the X-genes of both Lorna Dane and Emma Frost. North wears a version of Magneto's costume that is green like Lorna's hair. * Krakoa/Cypher as the Horseman of Famine, a symbiotic mutant. It is the sentient mutant island living within the body of the former New Mutant. Cypher's mutant power allowed him to read, translate, and interpret any language or means of communication. He had a similar bonding with his fellow New Mutant Warlock, a mutant member of the techno-organic alien race called the Technarchy. =Horsemen of Salvation= A new candre of Horsemen dubbed as the Horsemen of Salvation has since appeared on Earth Prime and appears to be an inversion of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. While Apocalypse's team has the Horsemen of Death, Famine, Pestilence and War, the Horsemen of Salvation has the Horsemen of Life, Bounty, Wellness and Peace. Likewise, in the same way as the Horsemen of Apocalypse are transformed into monstrous versions of themselves, the Horsemen of Salvation had drastic redesigns involving flowing robes and facial markings, however, these redesigns are later revealed to be psionic ones rather than physical. This team is led by Nate GreyUncanny X-Men (2018) #4. Marvel Comics. and is formed by Magneto who identifies himself as the Horseman of Peace, Warren Worthington as the Horseman of Life and X-villains, Blob and Omega Red as the Horsemen of Bounty and Wellness respectively. Magneto then blows up the Xavier Mansion in the name of peace.Uncanny X-Men (2018) #3. Marvel Comics. The Horsemen are revealed to be under the mental control of Nate Grey, and when Psylocke was able to release Warren from Nate's control by using her psionic katana, Nate Grey brainwashed Storm into becoming his new Horseman of Life.Uncanny X-Men (Vol. 5) #9. Marvel Comics. =Age of Apocalypse= The Four Horsemen in the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\". In the alternate reality known as the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\", the four Horsemen also existed but did not use any titles, with some exceptions such as Death and War. The only member who was also a Horseman in the main Marvel Universe was Abraham Kieros, also known as War. The first group of Horsemen consisted of Candra, Gideon, Death (an unknown female, speculated to be Selene or Lifeforce), and War. Later members included a never-seen Horseman named Bastion and Maximus as the second Death. Ultimately, Apocalypse announced the War of Succession, a battle between all his Horsemen. The four remaining Horsemen would rule North America alongside him. These four were Holocaust, Mikhail Rasputin, Bastion, and Mister Sinister. It is mentioned that Candra was killed by Holocaust, and Bastion was killed after the war by Abyss, making Abyss the newest horsemen and first recruit after the war. In a flashback, it is revealed that Mikhail was chosen after he defeated War during Apocalypse's attack on Russia. After the fall of Apocalypse and the ascension of Weapon X as the heir of Apocalypse, a new cadre of Horsemen was chosen, however the team was renamed as Ministers instead of Horsemen, with Azazel and the resurrected Emplate and the Summers brothers revealed to be among this group, Azazel as the Minister of Death,Age of Apocalypse #1. Marvel Comics. Emplate as the Minister of Pestilence, Cyclops as the Minister of Famine and Havok as the Minister of War.Age of Apocalypse #2. Marvel Comics. Each Minister has a special area of control and their own special troops. =Ages of Apocalypse= In one of the alternate realities created by Apocalypse during the \\"Ages of Apocalypse\\", Davan Shakari was the Horseman of Death. =Cable & Deadpool= In Cable & Deadpool, the \\"Enema of the State\\" story arc, Deadpool went to find the disappeared Cable and was forced to travel to alternate universes in his search. In the first universe, Deadpool found a new group of Horsemen. An eight-armed Spider-Man was Pestilence, Blob was Famine, and Archangel was Death. The three fought Deadpool, Siryn and Cannonball. When Deadpool figured out there was still one more Horseman left, a superpowered Cable (as War, the fourth Horseman) appeared and defeated all of them. Deadpool teleported to another universe when he realized he could not win. =Exiles= One of the original members of the Exiles was Thunderbird of Earth-1100, who was transformed into Apocalypse's Horseman, War. As War, Thunderbird has lost his humanity and sense of taste but had enhanced senses. He managed to break through Apocalypse's mind control and rejoined his allies, the X-Men. When he went into battle-mode, he could even overpower the Hulk. =House of M= When the Scarlet Witch altered reality and created the House of M, Apocalypse was brought back to life. He was a former enemy of Magneto, who became his subordinate, ruling North Africa. Magneto had sent him to kill Black Panther. He went to Wakanda, along with three of his Horsemen shown, Iceman, Angel, and Nightcrawler. Unlike the original continuity, none of the Horsemen were visibly altered or augmented in this reality.Black Panther (vol. 4) #7. Marvel Comics. =Marvel Mangaverse= In the Marvel Mangaverse comic, Avengers Assemble, Apocalypse was a tokusatsu-esque villain that grew in size and battled with the Iron Avenger (four vehicular machines that can transform together in the form of a giant Iron Man) piloted by the Avengers team (Captain America, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, Vision). The Horsemen included Archangel, Juggernaut, Mister Sinister, and the White Queen. =Mutant X= In the Mutant X series, Angel was chosen as Apocalypse's Horseman of Death, but went through a dramatically different transformation with bat-like wings and the ability to breathe fire. To signify his transformation, he changed his name to The Fallen and sided against Apocalypse with Havok's group known as the Six. Eventually his treachery got the best of him and Fallen betrayed his teammates to realign himself with the Horsemen against an evil Professor X. The other Horsemen were all new characters except for War, who resembled Abraham Kieros. =Ultimate Horsemen= In the Ultimate Marvel reality, Sinister is mentioned to be the first Horseman. He is later transformed into Apocalypse after committed several murders on his behalf, only to be defeated by a Phoenix Force empowered Jean Grey. Sinister has since revealed himself since the Ultimatum Wave, and is now, along with Layla Miller, tracking four specific mutants and the White Hot Room. Havok is revealed to be one and it's speculated that Quicksilver is also one of them. Layla also believes that Havok knows the identity of the fourth which indicates they already had found three of them. But since their mission never comes into fruition, as the entire Ultimate Universe came to an end as a consequence of a phenomenon known as an incursion, it remains to be seen, if this four mutants would have any relation to the Horsemen.Secret Wars #1. Marvel Comics. =Avengers/Alternate Age of Apocalypse= While waging war against Ultron in the near future, Kang accidentally breaks time itself in an attempt to gather an army from various time periods, to aid him in defeating Ultron. As a result of this, an alternate universe version of the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" Apocalypse and his Horsemen ended up in the present day Avengers Tower. A battle ensues between the Avengers and the Horsemen (Spider-Man, Wolverine, Scarlet Witch and Red Hulk, who have been infected with the techno-virus and fused with their mounts). Due to the temporal chaos, the fight ends when the villains are teleported away back into the timestream.Avengers Vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics. =What If...?= * In one alternate reality, Wolverine was turned into the Horseman of War (he was known as Death). He turned against Apocalypse and killed him, then began slaughtering Earth's criminals and villains. Eventually, he became the peaceful Brother Xavier. * In the reality depicted in What If Legion Had Killed Xavier And Magneto?, the Horsemen of Apocalypse were Storm, Juggernaut, Namor, and Hulk. =X-Men '92= In the final issue of X-Men '92 tying into the 2015 Secret Wars comic book event, Baron Robert Kelly (Baron of Westchester), Bastion, Exodus, and Mystique are revealed as Apocalypse's current Horsemen.X-Men '92 (Vol. 1) #4. Marvel Comics. In other media =Television= * In the X-Men, the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse were the same ones as in the X-Factor comics. The lineup was composed of mutants that submitted themselves to the so-called Mutant Cure, developed by Dr. Adler (actually Mystique in disguise). The \\"Cure\\" process transformed the four mutants: Autumn Rolfson (Famine), Plague (Pestilence), Abraham Kieros (War), and Angel (Death) into altered mutants under the control of Apocalypse. The four-part episode Beyond Good and Evil featured another team of Horsemen, created by Apocalypse during his time in Ancient Egypt. The style of these Horsemen reflected their Egyptian origins. In the episode The Fifth Horseman, Fabian Cortez (at that point a follower of Apocalypse) creates the Hounds rather than Horsemen. One is Caliban who resembled his appearance as \\"Death\\" in the comic books. * In X-Men: Evolution, Apocalypse enslaves two major heroes and two major villains to be his Horseman. Professor X became Death, with enhanced telepathy, telekinesis, agility, and strength, and the ability to conjure a \\"mental scythe\\" similar to Psylocke's daggers or knives. As War, Magneto had far more powerful magnetic abilities, including being able to survive in the vacuum of space by surrounding himself in a bubble of magnetized air, and reconstructing and controlling a destroyed Sentinel. Storm, as Famine, had enhanced abilities, generating lightning capable of overpowering Bezerker, as well as gaining increased stamina. Mystique served as Pestilence, having enhanced shape-shifting abilities, now able to transform into more than one object, such as a group of bats or snakes. Like Apocalypse, she gained the ability to manipulate her form on a molecular level, transforming her hands into blades, and turning into a puddle of water. She was also given enhanced speed and agility, as well as gaining an advanced healing factor, being able to replace a large portion of her stomach that was destroyed by Cyclops. * In Wolverine and the X-Men, there is a direct reference to the Horsemen of Apocalypse. After Angel lost his wings because of his father having them amputated (this was due to Angel's wings getting broken beyond repair following an ambush by Colonel Moss and the Mutant Response Division), Mister Sinister offered to get back Angel's wings. However, despite giving back his wings, Sinister transforms Angel into Archangel. Archangel was sent to kill his father but is stopped by Wolverine, Cyclops, and Storm. After that, Sinister sends Archangel to kidnap Jean Grey after she uses her powers by accident. Cyclops and Emma Frost tried to protect Jean from Sinister, but Archangel captures both Cyclops and Jean. Later on, the X-Men save them from Sinister, Archangel, and the Marauders. The Marauders were captured, but Mister Sinister and Archangel escaped. =Film= * In the post-credits scene of the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past, four horsemen are seen near En Sabah Nur as he telekinetically builds the pyramids of Egypt while a crowd of people chants his name. * Oscar Isaac portrays Apocalypse in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse. At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, the film's Horsemen were revealed to be Storm, Magneto, Archangel and Psylocke. The film depicts four original Horsemen of Apocalypse with Apocalypse in the earlier parts of the film: Pestilence (portrayed by Warren Scherer) as a mutant with gray skin, sharpened, animal-like teeth, and superstrength, Famine (portrayed by Rochelle Okoye) as a woman with Pyrokinesis, Death (portrayed by Monique Ganderton) as a white-haired mutant with telekinesis, mind-control and shield generation, and War (portrayed by Fraser Aitcheson) as a red-skinned man with the ability to disintegrate skin and muscle. Apocalypse's original Horsemen died protecting him, resulting in his spending millennia in stasis. Upon his awakening, Apocalypse starts establishing a new incarnation of the Horsemen from pickpocket Storm, Caliban's former enforcer Psylocke, mutant club fighter Angel, and Magneto after his family was killed in the crossfire of Magneto's standoff with the authorities. As part of their selection as Horsemen, Apocalypse enhances their powers; He states he will enhance Psylocke and Magneto, and teaches the latter new, destructive uses of his power. He transforms Angel's wings into their metallic state, while by doing so, also healing a serious burn. It is also implied that he has enhanced Storm's powers, making them, at least, slightly-stronger then before, suggested by how she uses them after his enhancement that also turns her hair white. After the enhancements, he also gives them the new battle suits they wear while working with him. During the final battle, Magneto and Storm both have a change of heart and turn against Apocalypse after Storm witnesses his true callous disregard for everyone in favor of his own power and Magneto is reminded of the family he has left, while Archangel is killed after he gets trapped in an airplane before it crashes and Psylocke escapes after Apocalypse's destruction. =Video games= * Akuma (Gouki in Japan) of Street Fighter is captured by Apocalypse and transformed into Cyber-Akuma (Mech-Gouki), serving as his Horseman of Death and final boss in the Capcom crossover fighting game Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. * The Horsemen of Apocalypse are referenced in X2: Wolverine's Revenge. After watching Wolverine in action, Apocalypse and Mister Sinister prepare the Horseman of Apocalypse. * In X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse, the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse were Abyss, Mikhail Rasputin, Holocaust, and Archangel. Mister Sinister was something of \\"fifth\\" horseman, working as Apocalypse's right-hand man, although before recruiting Archangel he was one of the main four according to Grizzly. During the fight with Apocalypse in the Vault of Ages, the Egyptian Statues based on the Four Horseman will come to life as clones of the Four Horseman. * The Horsemen of Apocalypse appear in the browser-based game Marvel: Avengers Alliance on Facebook. In the 16th Spec-Ops, Apocalypse selects four new Horsemen: X-23 as War, Rogue as Famine, Beast as Pestilence, and Iceman as Death. * The Horsemen in Marvel Contest of Champions are designated as Psylocke, Gambit, Wolverine and Archangel. It is not specified who is which role. * The Horsemen in upcoming game Marvel Realm of Champions are designated as follows: Archangel guarding the War Lands; Psylocke guarding the Plague Lands, Magneto guarding the Death Lands and Storm guarding the Famine Lands.

United Slovenia ( or ) is the name of an unrealized political programme of the Slovene national movement, formulated during the Spring of Nations in 1848. The programme demanded (a) unification of all the Slovene-inhabited areas into one single kingdom under the rule of the Austrian Empire, (b) equal rights of the Slovene language in public, and (c) strongly opposed the planned integration of the Habsburg Monarchy with the German Confederation. The programme failed to meet its main objectives, but it remained the common political program of all currents within the Slovene national movement until World War I.  Historical context  Following the Vienna Rebellion that forced Ferdinand I to abolish feudalism and adopt a constitution, many nations of the Austrian Empire saw a chance for strengthening their ideas. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, for the first time in centuries, all Slovenes were under the rule of one emperor. They were, however, divided between different political subdivisions, namely the provinces of Carniola, Styria, Carinthia, Gorizia and Gradisca, Istria, Trieste, Lombardy and Venetia (the Venetian Slovenia) and the Kingdom of Hungary (Prekmurje). In such a fragmentation, a self-government on national basis was impossible. The programme of United Slovenia was first formulated on 17 March 1848 by the Carinthian Slovene priest and political activist Matija Majar, and published on 29 March in the national conservative newspaper Kmetijske in rokodelske novice, edited by Janez Bleiweis. The idea advanced by Majar was elaborated and articulated by the society of Slovenes from Vienna, led at this time by the notable linguist Franz Miklosich, which published their manifesto on 29 April in the Slovene newspaper Novice from Klagenfurt. In the same period, the geographer Peter Kosler issued a map of all the Slovene Lands with ethnic-linguistic lines. Janez Bleiweis presented these demands to the Austrian Emperor's younger brother Archduke John, who had been living amongst the Slovenes in Maribor for 15 years. The three key points of the programme (the creation of Slovenia as a distinct entity, recognition of the Slovene language and opposition to joining the German Confederation) were signed as a petition. 51 signed sheets still exist, showing that the programme was well-supported by the masses. The signed petition was presented to the Austrian parliament; however, due to the uprising in Hungary, the Parliament was dissolved before it could even discuss the Slovene issue.  Aftermath  Chetnik leader Stevan Moljeviƒá idealized a plan in which Serbia and Slovenia would see substantially enlarged their territories and fullfield their territorial claims after liberation from Axis forces. The political aspirations of the Slovenes were suppressed by Baron Alexander von Bach's absolutism in 1851, and Slovene national awakening was moved back to an almost purely the cultural field. The programme of United Slovenia, however, remained the common political programme of all currents within the Slovene national movement until World War I. and was gaining power in the period of tabori between 1868‚Äì1871. After the First World War and dissolution of Austria- Hungary, it was partially replaced by the idea of integration with other South Slavs in the common country of Yugoslavia. After the collapse of the Austro- Hungarian Empire in October 1918, and the subsequent creation of first the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, a significant number of Slovenes, mostly in the Julian March and Carinthia, remained outside the country. Therefore, the programme of United Slovenia remained very much present in the political and intellectual debates of the interwar period. In April 1941, it was incorporated in the manifesto of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. After the annexation of the Slovenian Littoral to Yugoslavia in 1947 and the partition of the Free Territory of Trieste between Italy and Yugoslavia in 1954, the main demand of the United Slovenia programme ‚Äì the unification of the majority of Slovene Lands into a unified and autonomous political-administrative entity ‚Äì saw its fulfillment.

History  Founded in 1979, by Peter J Skirrow, the business was named after the home where development and manufacture began, as is so often the case, in garage and spare rooms. Since then it has gone on to become a well-known name in audio and broadcasting, supplying test equipment to broadcasters and studios worldwide, and represented at many professional audio exhibitions. The LA1 was the first product to be manufactured, and this was rapidly adopted by engineers at Independent Local Radio stations who needed quality testing equipment to ensure that their studios and transmitters met the IBA Code of Practice before they went on-air. It went on to be widely used by the BBC and other broadcasters and studios worldwide. Manufacture of the LA1 ceased with the introduction of the LA100 but it continues to be a sought-after product second hand. The LA100, launched in 1984, introduced microprocessor controlled 'Sequence testing', with LCD graphic display. A policy of free software upgrades based on feedback from customers resulted in the LA100 becoming a well known and highly regarded product throughout the Broadcast and Professional Audio community. It continues to be manufactured in 2018 and is unusual in that all LA100 units ever made can still be upgraded to the latest design, even to the point of a 'style upgrade' which replaces the outdated brown and cream case and panel with modern silver and grey versions. In this sense it demonstrated an early approach to the principles of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) that took effect in Europe in 2006. The MiniSonic MS10, introduced in 2005, is a small low-cost unit with many of the features of the LA100, including sequence testing. The DigiSonic DS10 provides all the features of the MS10 and LA100 in a software package that runs in Windows on a PC. This requires a sound card, for testing in the analog domain. The Lindos Test Sheet Database is a web-site that encourages users of Lindos test sets to upload their results for others to see. It is becoming a major source of independent results, for popular devices like the iPod as well as professional equipment.

It carries the entire MPEG transport stream being received from a DVB satellite feed entering the RF input (far left side in picture). Asynchronous Serial Interface, or ASI, is a method of carrying an MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG-TS) over 75-ohm copper coaxial cable or multimode optical fiber.EN 50083-9:2002 B.3.1 Layer-0: Physical requirements It is popular in the television industry as a means of transporting broadcast programs from the studio to the final transmission equipment before it reaches viewers sitting at home.  Standard  The ASI standard is maintained by CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, and is part of the collection of standards known as Digital Video Broadcast, or DVB.  Technical Specification  ASI carries MPEG data serially as a continuous stream with a constant rate at or less than 270 megabits per second, depending on the application. It cannot run faster than this, which is the same rate as SDIDigital Television: A Practical Guide for Engineers - 9.3 Physical Interfaces for Digital Signals, page 117 and also the rate of a DS4 telecommunications circuit which is typically used to transport the stream over commercial telephone/telecommunications digital circuits (Telco). The MPEG data bits are encoded using a technique called 8B/10B which stands for 8-bit bytes mapped to 10-bit character codes. Encoding maintains DC balance and makes it possible for the receiving end to stay synchronized. When on 75-ohm coaxial cable, ASI is terminated with BNC male connectors on each end. Electrically, the coaxial standard specifies an output voltage of 800 millivolts peak-to-peak, while the receiver must be able to operate from a voltage anywhere from 200 mV to 880 mV.EN 50083-9:2002 B.3.1.1 Electrical medium characteristics ASI is electrically identical to and has the same bit rate as standard definition SDI.Digital Television: A Practical Guide for Engineers - 9.3 Physical Interfaces for Digital Signals, page 117 When ASI is on optical fiber, it is multimode fiber.EN 50083-9:2002 B.3.1 Layer-0: Physical requirements There are two data transmission packet sizes commonly seen by the ASI interface and the cable carrying it: the packet and the packet, the fundamental building blocks of the MPEG Transport Stream. The 188 byte format is by far the most common packet size, used by the vast majority of transmissions. When optional Reed‚ÄìSolomon error correction data are included, a format primarily developed by Cable Television industry, the packet grows an extra 16 bytes to 204 bytes total. Time Warner Cable was the first company to implement the 204-byte standard in 1983.  Use  ASI has one purpose only: the transmission of an MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG- TS),TVTechnology.com - Asynchronous Interfaces For Video Servers DVB - Cable networks for television signals, sound signals and interactive services Part 9: Interfaces for CATV/SMATV headends and similar professional equipment for DVB/MPEG-2 transport streams - Annex B and MPEG-TS is the only standard protocol universally used for real-time transport of broadcast audio and video media today. Even when tunneled over IP, MPEG-TS is the lowest-common- denominator of all long-distance audio and video transport. In the US, it can be broadcast to homes as the ATSC Transport Stream; in Europe, it is broadcast to homes as the DVB-T Transport Stream. All broadcast satellite transmissions see it as the DVB-S Transport Stream. It is usually made up of one or more television channels with accompanying audio, sometimes with additional audio- only or data transmission channels. When that composite data transmission path, asynchronous but formatted data, travels through space as RF, it is usually called DVB-S, DVB-T, or ATSC. But when carried on coaxial cable, unmodulated, it is called an ASI signal. It is a one-way transmission, similar to RS-232 asynchronous data‚Äîa stream of raw but formatted zeros and ones‚Äîdesigned to primarily travel through coaxial cable at speeds that range from 6-200 megabits per second. Though 270 megabits per second is the rate of the underlying available bandwidth, Transport Streams, and therefore ASI transmissions, usually top out at around 200 megabits per second. A Transport Stream, and thereby ASI when over coax, can carry one or multiple SD, HD or audio programs that are already compressed, as opposed to an uncompressed SD- SDI () or HD-SDI (). An ASI signal can be at varying transmission speeds and is completely dependent on the user's engineering requirements. For example, an ATSC (US digital standard for broadcasting) has a specific bit rate of . Null characters, represented by the ASCII comma, are used to pad the transmission to that rate should the media itself not require the entire bitstream. Generally, the ASI signal is the final product of video and audio compression for distant delivery, internal distribution, or broadcast to the public, as is today's digital television and cable.. Though it is codec agnostic and can carry any kind or data, It most often carries MPEG2 (H.262 video with MPEG-1 Layer II audio) or MPEG4 (H.264 video with MPEG-4 Part 14 audio), ready for transmission to a television or radio broadcast transmitter, microwave system or other device. Sometimes it is also converted to fiber, RF or the \\"SMPTE 310\\" format: (a synchronous version of ASI developed by Harris specifically for the 19+ megabit per second ATSC-transmitter input feed).  Terminology  By far, in the television industry the term ASI refers to its use on coaxial cable, not optical fiber, and even though the standard itself also maintains its use on fiber, whenever ASI is mentioned the meaning is almost always coaxial cable. ASI is also sometimes referred to as DVB-ASI or TS-ASI.Digital Television: A Practical Guide for Engineers - 9.3 Physical Interfaces for Digital Signals, page 117  See also  * Asynchronous communication * Asynchronous serial communication * Serial communication * Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter * Modems Notes  References  Category:Data transmission Category:Digital television Category:Television terminology ","title":"Asynchronous serial interface"},{"id":"3646849","text":"Kahl may refer to: Places * Kahl am Main (officially ), a community in the Aschaffenburg district in the Regierungsbezirk of Lower Franconia * Kahl (river), a river in the northern Spessart in Bavaria and Hesse * Kleine Kahl (\\"Little Kahl\\"), a left tributary of the Kahl in the northern Spessart in Lower Franconia, Bavaria * Sommerkahl (Kahl), a left tributary of the Kahl in the northern Spessart in Lower Franconia, Bavaria People * Alfred Kahl German ciliate taxonomist (1877‚Äì1946) Other *Kahl (surname) * Kahl Nuclear Power Plant, the first nuclear power plant ever to be built in Germany * Kahl (film), a 1961 short German documentary film.

It is located from the center of Paris. It extends over 531 hectares of which 84 are green spaces. The most important public green space is the Plage Bleue Park where different events are organized every year. Among them, we have the Festival de l‚ÄôOh focused on environmental issues dealing with aquatic resources. Valenton is surrounded by the towns of Choisy-le-Roi, Cr√©teil, Crosne, Limeil-Br√©vannes, Villeneuve-Saint-Georges and Yerres. The town can be reached through the motorway A86 and the main road RN6. It is connected to the suburban rail network with the RER line D (Villeneuve Triage and Villeneuve- Saint-Georges, the two closest stations) or RER line A at Boissy-Saint-L√©ger.  History  Valenton was born in the 6th century. It was a dependency of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. The first inhabitants were mainly farmers specialized in viticulture. In 1726, it was still a village and had 250 inhabitants. Two centuries later, the population grew to about 1,000 inhabitants. The main activities became livestock farming and market gardening. The town extended in 1936 with the construction of two new residential areas (Les Vignes and Val Pompadour). At this time, the population was only 2,448. The town which was a strategic point during the Second World War was heavily bombarded by the Anglo-American aviation, which caused many casualties among the civil population. The aim for this heavy pounding induced by this air raid was to destroy the strategic marshalling yard of Villeneuve- Saint-Georges close to the Val Pompadour residential area. After the war, the town grew considerably. By 1962, the population reached 7,713 and in 1968 it was 10,539 inhabitants. Nowadays, 11,426 people live in the town.  Administration  The town is administered by Fran√ßoise BAUD since 2008. Valenton is one of the French Communist Party's strongholds. In fact, it is ruled by the French Communist Party since 1920, two years before the creation of the USSR in 1922. The only exception was the period ranging from 1941 to 1944 when France was under the rule of the Government of Vichy. It is one of France's first communes to have a female mayor (Fernande FLAGON).  Activities  Valenton hosts a water purification station. This town is strongly dedicated to the cause of the environmental improvement in urban areas. Hence the numerous green spaces in the heart of the town. More than 190 companies are located in its six business areas. The town's main cultural event: the Carnavalenton This successful cultural event is held every year in late June and it is the town's festival. It is the occasion for open-air concerts, exhibitions, many activities in which different charities take part. It is organized in the municipal central park (Parc de la Lib√©ration) and it lasts a whole day.  Green spaces  La Plage Bleue is the most important park of Valenton. It was initially an agricultural area for market gardening at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to its fertile soils. Further, the industrial exploitation of sands and gravel in the site gave birth to several ponds. In the 1960s, the inhabitants used to go and swim in the area which was called ‚Äúplage bleue‚Äù (blue beach). In 1979, the site was closed for insalubrity issues. By 1987, the Conseil G√©n√©ral and the Commune of Valenton decided to create a 40-hectare park, which was a success. The project won urban planning prizes in 1993 and 1994 rewarding its focus on environmental issues. Education Schools in the commune include:\\"Ecoles et enseignement secondaire.\\" Valenton.

History At the end of the 12th century a manor called \\"Wyda\\" is mentioned the first time, there's no exact year. \\"Widen\\", in the way like it's written today, appears the first time during the 14th century. In medieval times, the manor belonged to Habsburg. 1415 the Eidgenossen conquered the Aargau and Widen then belonged to the Grafschaft Baden. In March 1798 the French conquered Switzerland and proclamated the Helvetic Republic, in which Widen and Eggenwil formed one single municipality in the short-dated canton of Baden. After the foundation of the canton of Aargau 1803, Widen and Eggenwil were separated. Up to that time, there's not much known about Widen, because there are almost no documents left. Aerial view (1964) During the 19th century Widen stayed a small village. Many poor inhabitants had to leave their homes and emigrated. The given up farms were freshly occupied by people from the canton of Bern, which were Protestant. That's why today, compared to its merely catholic neighbour villages, Widen has a relatively high percentage of Protestant inhabitants. On 1 May 1902 the Bremgarten-Dietikon-Bahn was founded and Widen was connected to the railway network, by a station on the Mutschellen pass. During the first half of the 20th century Widen stayed small. However, from 1950 to 1990 the population began to grow rapidly, in 1990 3918 people lived in Widen. The population then sank slightly and now it stays constantly at about 3600 people. Geography Widen has an area, , of . Of this area, 44.8% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 37.8% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (0.4%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes). The village center is situated on a little plateau between the Mutschellen in the south and the Hasenberg in the north, of which the latter is the southernmost part of the Heitersberg. In the west the plateau goes down to the Reuss. Widen has grown together with some of its neighbour villages Berikon, Rudolfstetten-Friedlisberg and Zufikon. The highest point of the village lies on the Hasenberg at , the lowest point at , near Eggenwil. Neighbour villages are Bellikon in the north, Bergdietikon in the north-east, Rudolfstetten-Friedlisberg in the east, Berikon in the south-east, Zufikon in the south and Eggenwil in the west.

He was known as a music educator and for his advocacy for music education of children. Life and career Gill was born and raised in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood where he attended Marist College Eastwood. Prior to becoming a professional conductor, he was a music teacher at Marsden High School, West Ryde, in Sydney. One of his students was Kim Williams who later became a lifelong friend. In 1969, he was the founding conductor of the Strathfield Symphony Orchestra in Sydney.Strathfield Symphony ‚Äì About He continued as conductor in 1973‚Äì74 and returned in 1979 to conduct the orchestra's 10th anniversary concert. In 1971 he studied at the Orff Institute of the Mozarteum in Salzburg. He was later invited to teach at the summer schools in Salzburg; on one occasion he was one of the pianists in the version of Carmina Burana for two pianos and percussion, conducted by Carl Orff himself.Limelight, February 2009, p. 40. Gill was on staff at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music from 1975 to 1982. He was conductor with the Sydney Youth Orchestra Association from 1977 to 1982, conducting the orchestra's tour of Singapore and Hong Kong in 1981. In 1982, he was invited as a principal presenter to the annual conference of the American Orff Schulwerk Association (AOSA); this led to further workshops and classes throughout the United States. Other posts include dean of the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts WAAPA (1985‚Äì1990) and Director of Chorus at the Opera Australia (1990‚Äì1996). In August 2005, Gill founded and was the inaugural artistic director of Victorian Opera. In 2013, along with Rachael Beesley and Nicole van Bruggen, he established the Australian Romantic & Classical Orchestra (formerly \\"orchestra seventeen88\\"). Gill was the artistic director and principal conductor of the orchestra. In 2014, he was appointed to succeed Paul Stanhope as musical director of the Sydney Chamber Choir. In February 2017, Gill conducted the inaugural gathering of the Sydney Flash Mob Choir at the City Recital Hall in Angel Place, Sydney, bringing together singers and would-be singers from all walks of life for a monthly 40-minute singalong. Gill died on 28 October 2018, aged 76, from colorectal and peritoneal cancer. The day before he died, more than 70 musicians (including a police band) gathered outside Gill's home in Stanmore, in Sydney's inner west, and played for Gill and his family (who were inside the house), including \\"The Dam Busters March\\" (reportedly \\"Gill's favourite song from his favourite movie\\"). Music educator Gill was an advocate for the importance of music, arts and physical education for all children, believing that singing should be the basis of all music education. Prior to his death, plans were well-advanced to establish a music-based primary school in New South Wales in 2020, to be known as the Muswellbrook Richard Gill National Music Academy. Repertoire Richard Gill: The Value of Music Education, TEDxSydney, 2011 Gill's operatic repertoire included performances with Opera Queensland, Opera Australia, the Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne Festivals, and Windmill Performing Arts. He conducted the world premieres of Alan John's The Eighth Wonder (1995) and Moya Henderson's Lindy (2002) with Opera Australia, and Jonathan Mills' The Ghost Wife at the Melbourne International Arts Festival in 1999 (and again at London's Barbican Centre in 2002), and The Eternity Man at the Sydney Festival in 2004. For the Victorian Opera he conducted the new Australian works The Love of the Nightingale by Richard Mills (2007) and Alan John's Through the Looking Glass (2008). His work in the concert hall included concerts with all the major Australian orchestras. In his Discovery and Ears Wide Open series of concerts, he took selected works from the traditional and the contemporary classical music repertoire and analysed the works in a humorous and entertaining manner, trying to find what made the works \\"tick\\" and to, as he says, listen to the music \\"with new ears\\".

He was a correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 2005 to 2015. Since 2016, Jones has starred in the TBS comedy series The Detour, which he created with his wife, Samantha Bee. Personal life Jones was born and raised in Hamilton, Ontario. He attended Hill Park Secondary School and then Ryerson Theatre School in Toronto. Jones is married to Samantha Bee, the host of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and fellow former The Daily Show correspondent, with whom he has three children: daughter Piper Bee-Jones (born 2006), son Fletcher Bee-Jones (born 2008), and daughter Ripley Bee-Jones (born 2010). In 2014, he became a United States citizen.Lisa de Moraes, Jon Stewart sick - Jason Jones Daily Show Host October 8, 2014. Retrieved October 9, 2014. Career =The Daily Show with Jon Stewart= In September 2005, Jones joined The Daily Show cast as a contributor. When his wife left the show in late December for family leave, Jones was promoted to a full-time correspondent. Thereafter, he won a significant following at The Daily Show, thanks to a few pieces on the Denmark cartoons, Carl Monday, and Laguna Beach. Before Rob Corddry left The Daily Show, he said: \\"Jason Jones has raised the bar too high. I just can't say the things he says to people.\\" His expos√© on the real values of Wasilla, Alaska remains one of the most popular pieces on the Daily Show website. In 2014, Jones temporarily left The Daily Show to appear in a pilot for the sitcom Love Is Relative. In June 2009, Jones was sent to Tehran just prior to the controversial 2009 presidential election. Jones' reports in Iran included an interview with Newsweek journalist Maziar Bahari, who was arrested after the disputed June 2009 presidential elections. During Bahari's time in prison, his interrogators charged him with espionage and used Jones' interview as evidence against him. It was later clarified by Bahari that the charges were fabricated. Jones appeared as himself in the film version of Bahari's ordeal, Rosewater, encountering Bahari prior to taping their interview. The film was written and directed by Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Another segment in Iran poked fun at Iranians' greater knowledge of the United States compared with Americans' knowledge of Iran. That segment, along with a 2011 piece in which he invited cameras to his vasectomy, are regarded by TV Guide as his signature segments on the program.Rudolph, Ileane (July 27, 2015). \\"Alumni Association: A roundup of The Daily Shows coolest Graduates\\". TV Guide. pp. 21‚Äì22. On October 7, 2014, he co-hosted The Daily Show with his wife Samantha Bee, in the absence of Jon Stewart. He also disclosed on that episode that he had recently become an American citizen. Jason Jones announced that he would leave The Daily Show in 2015 to begin work on The Detour, a TBS show which he co- wrote and will executive produce with wife Samantha Bee. 2014 Sochi Olympics Jones was sent as a mock reporter to cover the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Through his visit, he often lampooned Russian culture and its perceived police state. For example, in one episode, Jones attempted to find a protest area in Sochi and was forced to drive well outside of the city to an abandoned parking lot which was designed as the zone for protesters; however, even then he was approached by police officers and asked to leave due to not having appropriate documentation. During his interview with opposition figure Alexei Navalny, the crew's cameras and other electronic equipment were jammed as they entered an apartment to conduct the interview. Jones also managed to hold a mock interview with Mikhail Gorbachev where he insisted Gorbachev put up the wall, a play on president Ronald Reagan's plea to Gorbachev to \\"tear down\\" the Berlin Wall. Alexei Navalny was arrested several days after conducting the interview with Jones, which was also satirized by Jon Stewart. Jones was able to interview Sergey Markov, a prominent Russian politician and academic. During the interview Jones questioned Markov about Russia's stance on gay rights, to which Markov responded that there are no issues with gay rights in Russia and that \\"you are absolutely free to make sex with this table.\\" The statement has since achieved notoriety with regards to Russia's stance on LGBT rights. During the program Jones also described Russia as a conservative paradise, noting the nation's relatively low flat tax, pro gun stance, opposition to gay marriage, and the powerful influence of the Orthodox church. He also remarked that Russia may be the \\"ultimate red state.\\" =Other work= Jones has also done various television work with his Canadian sketch comedy troupe The Bobroom, and was the host of Craft Corner Deathmatch on the Style Network in 2005. He also co-wrote, co-starred in, and co-produced the 2004 film Ham & Cheese with fellow Bobroom alumnus Mike Beaver; the film was nominated for six Canadian Comedy Awards in 2005. He has also had minor roles in numerous feature films, such as the 2002 Syfy original film Terminal Invasion and the 2003 film Public Domain, the latter of which also starred Don McKellar, Nicole DeBoer, and Beaver. He appeared in the TV show Queer as Folk, as well as appearing on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother as \\"Tony\\". Jones has appeared twice on the NBC series Law & Order as Len Pewels, host of the fictional Len Pewels' America. In 2008, Jones worked on a CBS sitcom about a celebrity chef (to be played by Jones), with his wife (to be played by Samantha Bee).The New York Times \\"Sitcom Deals For 'Daily Show' Stars\\". October 21, 2008 Jones and Bee starred as husband and wife in a movie entitled Cooper's Camera (USA Cooper's Christmas), in which their Christmas was recorded on a brand new (1985, at the time) camera. Jones did further work in a series of television advertisements, including a series for beer brand Molson, and appearing as Greg Gregger in Budweiser's short films The Best Man and The Company Man, as well as in some 30-second commercials. Jones had a supporting role in the 2009 movie All About Steve. In early 2010, he starred in a sitcom pilot for ABC called How to be a Better American, but it was not picked up as a series. He also made cameo appearances in the 2012 film Pitch Perfect, its 2015 sequel Pitch Perfect 2, the 2013 film The Art of the Steal and the 2015 films Hot Tub Time Machine 2 and The Night Before. In 2014, Jones starred in the pilot for the sitcom Love is Relative as the character \\"Nate\\". He worked with his wife, Samantha Bee, on development of a show for TBS, The Detour. TBS ordered the pilot, written by Jason Jones and Samantha Bee in October 2014. The show is based on the real life couple's own experience with family vacations. It was picked up for ten episodes in February 2015. On April 6, 2016, the show was renewed for a second season, ahead of the first-season premiere the same month. The second season premiered on February 21, 2017. On April 25, 2017, TBS renewed the series for a third season, which premiered on January 23, 2018.

It was designed by Raoul Hafner for a variety of transport roles including troop transport, supply dropping and casualty evacuation. It was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1961 to 1969. The Belvedere was Britain's only tandem rotor helicopter to enter production, and one of the few not built by Boeing or Piasecki. Design and development Wind tunnel model The Belvedere was based on the Bristol Type 173 10-seat (later 16-seat) civilian helicopter which first flew on 3 January 1952. The 173 project was cancelled in 1956 and Bristol spent time on the Type 191 and Type 193 to Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy specifications. These two naval variants were cancelled, but the RAF expressed an interest in the aircraft and the Type 192 \\"Belvedere\\" was created. Three Type 191 airframes were almost complete when the order was cancelled, but they were used to aid the development of the Type 192. The first two were used as test rigs for the new Napier Gazelle engines and the third was used for fatigue tests. The Type 192 shared some of its design features with the cancelled naval variants, which made it less than ideal for transporting troops. The front undercarriage was unusually tall, originally designed to give adequate clearance for loading torpedoes underneath the fuselage in the anti-submarine warfare role. This left the main passenger and cargo door above the ground. The engines were placed at either end of the cabin. (By comparison the purpose-designed troop transport contemporary Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight had its engines above the aft cabin to permit a rear loading ramp). To provide access to the cabin from the cockpit there was a small entry past the engine that resulted in a bulge on the left side of the fuselage. The first Type 192 prototype XG447 flew on 5 July 1958 with tandem wooden rotor blades, a completely manual control system and a castored, fixed quadricycle undercarriage. From the fifth prototype, the rotors fitted were all-metal, four-bladed units. Production model controls and instruments allowed night operations. The prototype machines had an upwards-hinged main passenger and cockpit door, which was prone to being slammed shut by the downwash from the rotors. This was replaced by a sliding door on the later aircraft. Twenty-six Belvederes were built, entering service as the Belvedere HC Mark 1. The Belvederes were originally designed for use with the Royal Navy but were later adapted to carry 18 fully equipped troops with a total load capacity of 6,000 lb (2,700 kg). The two rotors were synchronised through a shaft to prevent blade collision, allowing the aircraft to operate through only one engine in the event of an emergency. In that case, the remaining engine would automatically run up to double power to compensate.Flight International, 8 February 1962 p212 Bristol attempted to market a civilian variant of the helicopter, designated the Type 192C. The 192C would have had seats for 24 passengers and was aimed at intercity services. To demonstrate the aircraft's potential, Bristol chief test pilot Charles \\"Sox\\" Hosegood set the London‚ÄìParis and Paris‚ÄìLondon speed records in May 1961 in a Belvedere. However, no orders were placed for the 192C. Operational history HC.1 of 26 Squadron RAF in Aden The first prototype Belvedere went to the Belvedere Trials Unit at RAF Odiham, which was subsequently reformed as No. 66 Squadron RAF in 1961. Engine starter problems caused trouble early on but operational deployment continued. The prototype saw service in Europe, Africa, Southern Arabia and Borneo. XG447 was broken up at Boscombe Down on 7 August 1966. In June 1960 the fifth prototype, XG452 set a speed record of between Gatwick and Tripoli. In 1962 a 72 Squadron Belvedere lowered the 80 ft tall spire onto the new Coventry Cathedral. As well as 66 Squadron, the type was deployed to 72 Squadron in 1961 and 26 Squadron in 1962, all at RAF Odiham. 26 Squadron later transferred to RAF Khormaksar where it disbanded in November 1965. The helicopters were transferred by HMS Albion to Singapore to join 66 Squadron until the squadron was disbanded in 1969. 72 Squadron kept its Belvederes until August 1964 when it exchanged them for Westland Wessex.Jefford, RAF Squadrons The RAF Belvederes were involved in combat in Aden Emergency and Borneo (during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation).

The lyrics are based on that of a poem by Ivan Vazov titled Radetzky after the steamship seized by the rebels. The storyline recounts a historically accurate incident from the Bulgarian struggles against Ottoman rule, which has earned the status of modern myth for Bulgarians, to some degree due to this song. On 29 May 1876 Bulgarian revolutionary and poet Hristo Botev at the head of 205-strong company of rebels seized control of the Austro-Hungarian passenger steamship Radetzky by armed force and used it to cross the Danube from Romania to the Bulgarian territories of the Ottoman Empire in order to join the April Uprising. Dagobert Engl√§nder, Captain of the Radetzky, later recounted that \\"he had rarely met a man so impressive or energetic as Botev\\". The melody was composed by vocalist Ivan Karadzhov, according to his biography. In some performances of the song, the fourth verse is omitted.Notice how at the different timestamps, the lyrics performed are not the same.

Its south campus is located at Biglang Awa St., Grace Park East, 12th Avenue, Caloocan City, Metro Manila, Philippines (also known as EDSA/Biglang Awa Campus) and the north campuses are Camarin Business Campus, Congressional Campus, and TechVoc Campus (near Libis, Camarin).  History  The University of Caloocan City was formed in 2004 out of Caloocan City Polytechnic College (CCPC), which started as a two-year course college in 1971 and offered four-year courses in 1975. Its first programs were Bachelor of Science degrees in Industrial Education (BSIE) and Business Technology (BSBT). The school was first located in a building at Caloocan High School (located at 10th Avenue, Grace Park). It was transferred to its first stand-alone location (at General San. Miguel St. Sangandaan, Caloocan City) when the first building burned down. On January 23, 2004, Caloocan City Council unanimously approved the Ordinance 1020-2003 principally authored by then councilor Gonzalez Jr., which authorized the city government to convert the existing Caloocan City Polytechnic College into a full-fledged university. The initially city hall-funded tertiary educational institution will henceforth be called as University of Caloocan City, the lone public university in Caloocan. On April 20, 2006, the 32nd Commencement Exercise took place at Folk Arts Theater, Manila. The BSIE graduates were the first to be called on stage, which is a tradition at the Commencement Exercises. At the start of academic year 2015, Councilor Dale Gonzalo \\"Along\\" Malapitan made an ordinance that the tuition fee in the university will be free for all freshmen and transferees who graduated from elementary and high school in Caloocan City, as long as they are children of, or they are themselves, registered voters of Caloocan. The university also offered Senior High School program for Junior High School completers for the School year 2016-2017, in line with the recent implementation for the K-12 program. ABM (Accountancy, Business, and Management), & HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) strands were available in the University for the Senior High School program.

He was a trader, farmer, Indian Department official, political, fur trader, and militia officer during and after the era of the American Revolution. He held a key position in Anglo- Indian affairs during the time period. Elliott came to America in 1761 and settled in Pennsylvania during the French and Indian War. As a trader in western Pennsylvania and Ohio in the 1760s and 1770s, and as a captain in the British Indian Department during the Revolution, he had lived and fought among the tribes of the Northwest, particularly the Shawnee. He was married to a Shawnee woman and spoke the language fluently, his sympathies with the Indians. With the Shawnee woman, Elliott had two sons named Alexander and Matthew. He later married Sarah Donovan and they had another two sons, Francis Gore and Robert Herriot Barclay. In 1778 Elliott, along with Alexander McKee and Simon Girty fled to Detroit. He served as a scout on Henry Hamilton's expedition to Vincennes in the autumn of 1778 but left before Hamilton was captured by the Americans in February 1779. For the remainder of the Revolution Elliott served as a British Indian agent. After the Revolution, Elliott established himself on a farm at what became Amherstburg, Ontario in Upper Canada. He eventually owned over 4,000 acres and numerous slaves, a number of whom he had acquired in the course of raids during the Revolution and refused to relinquish despite government pressure. Elliott is mentioned as a slave owner whose slaves were particularly fearful of. He had installed a lashing ring to a tree in front of his house to instill fear in his slaves; which instead encouraged many to try to escape. In partnership with William Caldwell, he renewed his trading activities, dealing with the Indians of Lake Erie, bringing provisions from Pittsburgh to sell to them as well as in Detroit. Business became so difficult to maintain in such a disputed area, that his company went bankrupt in 1787. Despite this, and the fact that Elliott was illiterate, he became a justice of the peace for the new District of Hesse in 1788. He went on to become superintendent at Amherstburg in 1796, but had been dismissed two years later in 1798 after a dispute over the irregularities in the issuing of provisions. In 1790, Elliott became assistant to McKee, who was Indian superintendent at Detroit while Elliott continued to encourage the Shawnee and other native groups to oppose American advance across the Ohio River. With McKee, Elliott helped organize the different tribes to resist occupancy and land cessions. Elliott went on to become \\"superintendent of Indians and of Indian Affairs for the District of Detroit\\" in the summer of 1796, but by December 1797 he was dismissed. During the next ten years he tried significantly to gain reinstatement, travelling to England in 1804 and even gaining the support of fellow politicians. None of this worked, though from 1800 to 1804, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. He was also re-elected in 1804 and 1808, though at these dates he attended meetings less frequently due to other business. When British-American relations went sour again in 1807, the great importance of Elliott's influence among the Indians was recognized and in 1808 he was reappointed superintendent in place of Thomas McKee. By the fall of 1808 it became apparent that the Indians were preparing for war, and the British did not want to be blamed. Elliott worked closely with Tecumseh for an alliance. Before the War of 1812, Elliott had succeeded in gaining the Indian alliance with natives in American territory as well as British. During the last few months of his life, Elliott led Indian raids on the Niagara frontier. He died from illness in 1814 in the Burlington area of Ontario.

H. Lawrence. Individual items were originally written between 1913 and 1921, many of them against the background of World War I. Most of these versions were placed in magazines or periodicals. Ten were later selected and extensively revised by Lawrence for the England, My England volume. This was published on 24 October 1922 by Thomas Seltzer in the US. The first UK edition was published by Martin Secker in 1924. Stories The stories included in the collection are: * England, My England * Tickets, Please * The Blind Man * Monkey Nuts * Wintry Peacock * You Touched Me * Samson and Delilah * The Primrose Path * The Horse Dealer's Daughter * Fanny And Annie = Wintry Peacock = The short story, Wintry Peacock tells the story of an Englishwoman who has been left with her husband's parents for the duration of the war. Shortly before her husband's return, there is a letter addressed to her husband written in French. She asks a man she sees in passing to translate it, and though the letter details that her husband had an affair with a young woman while away at war, and that this woman had recently delivered a baby by him and plans to come to England, the man translating tells the woman instead that the baby is the young girl's newborn brother and that her parents named the child after the soldier for having protected their family during the war. That evening the man finds the woman's peacock in the cold and takes it in, returning it the following day to find that the husband has returned. When asked in private what the letter had said, the letter having since been burnt according to his wife, the translator tells the man both what the letter said, leaving out that the woman and her child are coming to England, and tells him also what he told the man's wife. The husband laughs and jokingly berates the man for bringing the peacock home and suggests that, though his wife loves it very much, he will perhaps kill it. The two both laugh, seemingly at the misfortune of both the wife and the mistress, though the translator may be laughing as well at the husband himself. = You Touched Me = You Touched Me tells the story of a young boy who is adopted by a family that is without any male children. The mother having died, and one sister having been married off, two sisters remain with the father and raise the boy, though the boy is reluctant to embrace the education and lifestyle offered him and opts to leave for Canada. When war breaks out the boy returns as a young man and spends time with the patriarch of the house who is close to death. The sisters believe the young man is in search of a legacy, but when the elder sister mistakenly brushes her hand against the young man, thinking that it is her father in the dark of her father's bedroom, the young man asks the father for the daughter's hand in marriage, even though she is old enough to be his mother. Both daughters are opposed to the proposition and assume the young man is doing this in hopes of inheriting money (though the boy admits to himself alone that this is only part of the reason, as he wants both the money and the daughter). The father redrafts his will, stating that his entire legacy will go to the young man if his daughter refuses to marry him. The daughter eventually gives in and while on his death bed the father demands to watch his elder daughter kiss the young man as if asserting his will over his daughter. = Samson and Delilah = Samson and Delilah details the narrative of a woman whose husband had abandoned both her and her newborn child to go mining for gold, only to return unannounced some fifteen years later to the lodging where his wife serves as a landlady. Though she at firsts denies being his wife, she eventually admits to it, but only after having soldiers staying at her lodgings tie up her husband and leave him outside. He breaks free from the rope restraining him, and re-enters the lodgings, finding his wife sitting by the warmth of a fire. He takes a seat next to her and admits to his wrongdoing, but asks her to take him back, telling her that he has returned with a thousand pounds to his name. = The Primrose Path = The Primrose Path tells of the youngest sibling of a family, considered to be a black sheep of sorts, who leaves his first wife for a young woman who later, according to him, poisons him. He jumps around from England to Australia and back, where he finally settles in as a taxi-cab driver and takes up with a young woman, living with both her and her mother. A nephew of his reconnects with him and tells him that his first wife is dying of consumption, and on her deathbed asks that he takes their remaining daughter (the elder of their two daughters was given to a wealthy aunt). He agrees and then returns to his girlfriend's home with his nephew to share dinner. At the end of the narrative it is stated that the young girl will leave him, suggesting the fleeting nature of the life he has chosen.

They played at Bloomfield Road, between 2005-2007, then moved to the Woodlands Memorial Ground owned by Fylde rugby union club. They were members of the Rugby Football League from 2005 to 2010. History The club was founded as Blackpool West Coast Panthers in 2004 for the 2005 season, and took the place of Chorley Lynx, which had folded. Sixteen of Chorley's squad and Chorley coach Mark Lee joined the Panthers. Blackpool agreed an initial two-year tenancy of Bloomfield Road, the home of Blackpool F.C. and they were elected to National League Two for the 2005 season. The original chairman quit before the season started leaving Dave Rowland in charge. Coach Mark Lee was sacked before the start of the season and appointed former Great Britain international Kevin Ashcroft as Team Manager on a 12-month contract. The Panthers struggled on the field finishing second bottom of National League Two with only managing three wins all season, against Sheffield Eagles, Gateshead Thunder and London Skolars. Overall the Panthers failed to make an impact on the Blackpool public, with attendances averaging 400. In September 2005 Dave Rowland, who had resigned from the board of directors but remained the clubs majority shareholder, put forward a proposal to relocate the Panthers to Preston where they would ground share with Preston Grasshoppers rugby union club. However, the board bought out former major shareholder Dave Rowland's stake in the club and a last minute deal saw them secure the use of Bloomfield Road at a reduced rent. And at a public meeting held at Bloomfield Road in October 2005, former chairman of Leeds Rhinos, Alf Davies warned the club and its fans that it could take up to five years to establish the club in the resort. Davies who had been appointed by the Rugby Football League to help the new Panthers' board of directors revitalise the club said, \\"\\"It will be a hell of a struggle and it will take five years before you can say you are established in rugby league, but if directors hold their nerve it can be done.\\" The club also confirmed that they were working on a plan to develop links with local schools. The 2006 season was again a difficult one for Blackpool as they finished bottom of National League Two, winning only four games. In June and July three games were played at Fylde Rugby Union Club's Woodlands Memorial Ground in Lytham St Annes as Bloomfield Road was being reseeded. The Panthers beat Keighley Cougars and Workington Town but lost to Gateshead Thunder. In October 2006 a contract was signed to move to Woodlands Memorial Ground for an initial period of six years, covering the seasons from 2007 to 2012. The club's administrative and commercial base also moved to Woodlands, with Panthers' Chairman, John Chadwick, saying, \\"We're looking for stability and a base from which we can establish the Panthers as a successful national league club operating from the Fylde Coast. The set-up at the ground is first rate. Andy Gregory took control of the Panthers in June 2007 when they were bottom of National League Two and had not won for 25 matches. However, Gregory resigned after the club finished the entire season without managing a single win, becoming only the fourth professional sports club to have suffered that fate in the United Kingdom. Former Ireland international, Martin Crompton was appointed as coach at the end of the 2007 season. The club finally ended their losing streak, which had lasted two years and 45 matches, on 6 April 2008, when they beat Workington Town 24‚Äì20. They had not won a match since beating Gateshead Thunder 38‚Äì36 on 15 July 2006, with the run being made up of 32 National League Two matches, 12 Northern Rail Cup matches and two Carnegie Challenge Cup matches. It was the club's first win under coach Martin Crompton. In May 2008 they won back-to- back matches for only the second time in the club's history, beating Hunslet Hawks and then a week later, seventh-placed Swinton Lions 30‚Äì28 prompting Martin Crompton to target the league play-offs saying after the Swinton victory, \\"The play-offs have always been the goal. That victory was a fantastic achievement against a quality team. Everyone is playing with confidence now. On 12 July 2009 the Panthers won their first trophy, when they won the inaugural Northern Rail Nines beating Sheffield Eagles 14‚Äì10 in the final at Bloomfield Road. The Panthers went on to finish fifth in Championship 1 in 2009, only to lose in the first round of the play-offs. After the 2009 season, Bobby Hope replaced John Chadwick as club chairman and set the Panthers' sights high for the 2010 campaign, vowing to win the Championship 1 league title.http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sports-news/Warriors-join-in- as-Panthers.6142207.jp The Panthers finished the season in the play-offs but went into administration in October and had their membership of the RFL cancelled having failed to provide the RFL a financial plan for the upcoming season, and therefore took no part in the 2011 Co-operative Championship.

History  WABC Radio (770 AM, New York City) played rock and roll from 1960 until May 10, 1982, before changing to a talk radio format. With talk shows not quite as popular on the weekend, Tim McCarthy, WABC President and General Manager, and Phil Boyce, Operations Manager and Program Director, decided to bring back the oldies music on Saturday nights. Saturday Night Oldies premiered on December 3, 2005, exactly six months after WCBS-FM (also in New York) dropped the oldies format on June 3, 2005. Mark Simone hosted the show, which featured popular music from the late 1950s through the 1970s with an emphasis on songs that became popular, but have largely been forgotten. Original WABC jingles from the station's Top 40 era were played and Simone took phone calls and reads posts from the Message Board discussing a wide variety of events in popular culture from that time period. The crew included Mike Gunzelman, the producer, and Mike Savilli on controls. In July 2009 the show was renamed Saturday Night and shortened to 3 hours, airing from 6 PM to 9 PM. Newer music was played, as well as oldies, and a wider range of guests from the entertainment world were interviewed along with more discussion of entertainment issues. In September 2010 the show was shortened to two hours, from 7 to 9 PM. It was also announced at that time that the Saturday Night show would soon be going national, and would be syndicated to stations in other cities. The show was heard for the last time in December 2012 when Mark Simone resigned from WABC and joined WOR where he is heard Monday - Friday from 10 AM - 12 noon.

Whereas the Animal Liberation Front specialized in clandestine activity, mainly masked, at night, and involving small numbers of people, the Animal Liberation Leagues consisted of coordinated raids, or 'invasions', by a large number of people, mainly carried out during the day.Mann, Keith (2007) From Dusk 'til Dawn, London: PuppyPincherPress, p.74. One journalist described the Animal Liberation Leagues as \\"a sophisticated...development in the move to direct action\\".Henshaw, David (1989) Animal Warfare: The Story of the Animal Liberation Front, London: Fontana. Raids were often carried out at the same time as legal demonstrations. Central Animal Liberation League The Central Animal Liberation League (CALL) was an animal rights organisation based in central England that was active during the 1980s. Over a hundred animals were taken by this organisation, mainly from centres of animal experimentation. They also took documentation and video footage. The slogan of the CALL was \\"Through The Door When They Least Expect It\\". * A fifteen-year-old rhesus monkey called Beatrice was the only monkey ever to be taken from a UK laboratory, by CALL. She had been used in arthritis research. * Guinea pigs used in burn experiments were taken from a laboratory in Birmingham by CALL activists posing as window cleaners. * A raid on the premises of Animal Supplies London Ltd netted van loads of documentation and found a fridge filled with decapitated monkey heads and bats. * Video footage taken at Oxford University Park Farm showed rhesus monkeys that had been used in eye experiments. * Experiments on rats, pigs, mice, rabbits, ferrets, polecats, primates, pigeons and sheep were filmed at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. * Roebuck Farm in Hertfordshire was raided in 1986. Documentation taken from here revealed that primates had been supplied by Windsor Safari Park, Chessington Zoo, and Ravenstone Zoo for use in experiments at places like Huntingdon Life Sciences. Eastern Animal Liberation League The Eastern Animal Liberation League (EALL) was based in the East of England. The main action of the EALL took place in August 1984. Unilever research laboratories in Bedford was stormed by over two hundred animal rights activists and the same time as a legal demonstration was taking place at the front. 25 people were later convicted of conspiracy to burgle and sentenced to a total of 41 years. One of those convicted was Jill Phipps, who was killed in 1995 during a demonstration, when she was run over by a lorry carrying calves for the live export trade. Jill, along with her mother Nancy Phipps, and her sister Lesley Phipps, were all convicted in the Unilever case. Jill's sentence was suspended because she had gotten pregnant, but her mother and sister were sent to HM Prison Holloway. These heavy losses to the animal rights movement led to the winding up of the EALL and a change in tactics. Northern Animal Liberation League The Northern Animal Liberation League was active in the north of England. Their campaigning slogan was, \\"Over the wall when they least expect it\\".Mann, Dusk, p. 74. It specialised in mass daytime invasion of places such as animal laboratories to obtain photographs and other information, and in some cases animals were also removed. * In 1980, over a hundred animal rights activists invaded Babraham Agricultural Research Centre in Cambridge. They witnessed sights such as pigs with electrodes in their brains, cows with windows on the side of their stomachs and goats with udders grafted onto their necks. Eighteen people were arrested. Footage and media coverage of this raid is credited as a major expose of the vivisection industry.Mann, Dusk, p. 76. * Several dogs were removed from the University of Sheffield by the NALL in 1980. In the publicity that followed, one dog in particular known as Blackie was recognised by her former owners and reunited with them. * In April 1984, three hundred NALL activists stormed the ICI laboratories at Alderley Edge in Cheshire. Several people were arrested and two imprisoned. South East Animal Liberation League This image of a monkey with the word \\"crap\\" tattooed on his head was taken during a daylight raid in 1984 by the South East Animal Liberation League, from a Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) research facility in Kent. The BUAV prosecuted the RCS in connection with material found during the raid, leading to a ¬£250 fine, overturned on appeal.Henshaw, David. Animal warfare: The story of the Animal Liberation Front. HarperCollins, 1989, pp. 78-88, cited in Garner, Robert. Animals, Politics and Morality. Manchester University Press, 2004, p. 236; also see Garner, p. 199. More details in Vaughan, Claudette. \\"The Mike Nunn Interview: Strategies and Tactics\\", Abolitionist Online, retrieved March 7, 2008. The South East Animal Liberation League (SEALL) existed in the southeast of England. It specialised in mass daylight raids of places such as animal research laboratories. * In 1983 there was a mass invasion of the Wellcome laboratories at Dartford, Kent. Offices were broken into and documents removed, but because the company wanted to avoid further publicity, no one was charged. * In August 1984, sixty SEALL activists carried out a daylight raid on the Buxton Brown Research Farm of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), located in the village of Downe in the London Borough of Bromley. They uncovered details of dental and diet experiments being carried out on monkeys and other animals. Information obtained led to the Royal College of Surgeons being prosecuted by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection for causing unnecessary suffering to a ten-year-old macaque monkey called Mone. They were fined ¬£250. In order to obtain the prosecution, activist Mike Huskisson had to admit to being present on the day and witnessing the documents bing removed. He was sentenced to prison for eighteen months. The RCS's conviction was later overturned on a technicality. * Shamrock Farm, which imported primates for experiments was the focus of a SEALL campaign. * The University of Surrey was raided by SEALL, but the only conviction was of a woman who had taken out a dog from the laboratory. * In October 1984, SEALL carried out three simultaneous raids on animal laboratories in Hampshire. Due to their previous successes, the police had the group under surveillance and were more prepared. Activists turned up at APT Consultancy, Cottagepatch Kennels, and Wickham Laboratories. It achieved widespread press coverage and nineteen people were arrested and charged, dubbed the \\"Wickham 19\\". Seven of them were later imprisoned, for sentences of up to three years. This caused the SEALL to disband.

Flashback arrestors with different size and flow rate, and different connections A flashback arrestor or flash arrestor is a gas safety device most commonly used in oxy-fuel welding and cutting to stop the flame or reverse flow of gas back up into the equipment or supply line. It protects the user and equipment from damage or explosions. These devices are mainly used in industrial processes where oxy-fuel gas mixtures are handled and used. Flashback arrestors as safety products are essential to secure the workplaces and working environment. In former times wet flashback arrestors were also used. Today the industry standard is to use dry flashback arrestors with at least two safety elements. Dry type Dry flashback arrestors typically use a combination of safety elements to stop a flashback or reverse flow of gas. This type is typically found in cutting and welding applications all over the world. They work equally effectively in all orientations, and need very little maintenance. The simplest flashback arrestor consists of a metallic tube filled with iron wool, which cools the flame below the ignition temperature. In many countries or regions they are mandatory to be installed at the gas regulator or gas outlet/ tapping point. Depending on the application they are also often used at the torch side as an additional safety device. Flashback arrestors help prevent: * Further gas flow in the case of pressure shocks. * The entry of air or oxygen into the distribution line or single cylinders. * Flashbacks which are the rapid propagation of a flame down the hose. * Further gas flow in the event of a burnback. According to the standard DIN EN ISO 5175-1 (formerly EN 730-1) they include a minimum of two safety elements: A gas non-return valve (NV), which: * prevents dangerous gas mixtures. * ensures the gas only flows in the intended direction. and a flame arrestor (FA), which: * cools the flame to below the ignition temperature of the gas or gas mixture. * prevents flashback. In addition to these two basic safety functions a flashback arrestor can also have a: Thermal cut-off valve (TV), which: * prevents excessive temperatures. * closes automatically at a certain temperature and cuts off the gas flow long before the ignition temperature of the gas mixture is reached. and a pressure-sensitive gas cut- off valve (PV), which stops the gas flow in the event of pressure shocks The flashback arrestors are suitable for most technical gases (fuel gases) such as acetylene, hydrogen, methane, propane, propylene and butane as well as oxygen and compressed air. Flashback arrestors have to be tested for gas non-return, for tightness and for gas flow by a qualified person depending on the country specific regulations. Wet type Liquid seal flame arrestors are liquid barriers following the principle of a siphon where the liquid stops the entering deflagration and/or detonation and extinguishes the flame, they work by bubbling the gas through a non-flammable and ideally non-gas-absorbing liquid, which is typically water. They stop the flame by preventing it from reaching the submerged intake. These devices are normally very effective at stopping flashbacks from reaching the protected side of the system. They have the disadvantages of only working in one orientation and tend to be much larger than dry type arrestors. This makes them mainly only suitable for large or fixed installations and the liquid level needs to be constantly checked. On smaller units having a pressure release valve to prevent the unit from bursting under a severe flashback, the fluid level should be monitored to keep it always above the intake and not so high that the liquid could splash or overflow into the outlet.

His best-known works include Flight from Etna (1938‚Äì39), Crucifixion (1941) and La Vucciria (1974). Guttuso also designed for the theatre (including sets and costumes for Histoire du Soldat, Rome, 1940) and did illustrations for books.

The Independent, review of gallery show of Alberto della Ragione's collection of Italian paintings at the Estorick collection, from the 1930s to the 1950s, p. 18 Review section introduced him to many in the English-speaking world. A fierce anti-Fascist, \\"he developed out of Expressionism and the harsh light of his native land to paint landscapes and social commentary.\\" Biography The Museum of Renato Guttuso in Bagheria = Introduction = He was born in Bagheria, near Palermo in Sicily, but from 1937 lived and worked largely in Rome. In his youth he joined the Gruppo universitario fascista, but later he became an anti-fascist and atheist. He joined the banned Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1940 and left Rome to become an active participant in the partisan struggle from 1943. He was also an opponent to the Mafia. In 1972 Guttuso was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize. In 1976 he was elected to the Italian Senate as a PCI representative for the Sicilian constituency of Sciacca. = Childhood = Renato Guttuso's father, Gioacchino Guttuso, was a land surveyor and amateur watercolourist. There are a number of portraits of Gioacchino in the collection donated to the mayor of Bagheria. Renato Guttuso began signing and dating his works at the age of thirteen. Guttuso lived close to a house amongst the Valguarnera villas and Palagonia, which he would soon represent in paintings inspired by the cliffs of Aspra. In Palermo and in Bagheria Guttuso observed the dereliction of the 18th-century villas of the nobility, abandoned to decay as a consequence of political infighting within the municipal chambers. At the same time, his family suffered a period of economic stress because of the hostility shown by Fascists and clergy towards his father. Guttuso went to Palermo for high school studies, and then to the University, where his development was modelled on the European figurative trends of the day, from Courbet to Van Gogh and to Picasso. In the early part of the 1930s, Guttuso was a frequent visitor to the studio of one of the most prolific futuristic painters, Pippo Rizzo.Archivi Guttuso biography. guttuso.com His works opened doors for him in Milan and to further travel throughout Europe. As Guttuso's expressionism became stronger he painted more scenes of nature in flower, lemon trees, saracen olive trees, all in an environment suspended between myth and island insularity, so that, when sent to the Quadriennale expo of 1931, he joined a collective of six Sicilian painters, acclaimed by the critic Franco Grasso as a \\"disclosure, a Sicilian affirmation\\". Back in Palermo Guttuso opened a studio in Pisani street and together with the painter Lia Pasqualino and the sculptors Barbera and Nino Franchina, formed the Gruppo dei Quattro (The Group of Four). = Rejection of the academic principles and social art = Guttuso became a member of an artistic movement named \\"Corrente\\". The movement stood for free and open attitudes, in opposition to the official culture, and chose a strong anti- fascist position in thematic choices through the years of the Spanish Civil War. In Milan, where he stayed for three years, Guttoso was part of Corrente di Vita. Here he developed his \\"social\\" art, his moral and political commitment being visible in paintings such as Fucilazione in Campagna (1938), dedicated to the writer Garc√≠a Lorca, and Escape from Etna. Moving to Rome, Guttuso opened a study in Via Margutta where, because of his exuberance, his friend Marino Mazzacurati nicknamed him \\"Unbridled\\". He lived close by to significant artists of the time: Mario Mafai, Corrado Cagli, Antonello Trombadori, keeping also in contact with the group from Milan of Giacomo Manz√π and Aligi Sassu. \\"Crocifissione\\" (\\"Crucifixion\\") is the painting for which he is best remembered. At the time it was derided by the clergy, who labelled Guttuso a \\"pictor diabolicus\\" (\\"a devilish painter\\"). The fascists also denounced it for depicting the horrors of war under a religious cover. Guttuso wrote in his diary: \\"it is the symbol of all those who endure insults, jail, torture for their ideas\\". Guttuso also spoke publicly about \\"The Crocifissione\\", saying \\"this is a time of war. I wish to paint the torment of Christ as a contemporary scene... as a symbol of all those who, because of their ideas, endure outrage, imprisonment and torment\\". He did not stop working during the years of World War II, his work ranging from landscape glimpses of the Gulf of Palermo to a collection of drawings entitled Massacri (Massacres), that clandestinely denounced slaughters such as the Fosse Ardeatine. In 1945 Guttuso, along with artists Birolli, Marchiori, Vedova and others, founded the \\"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti' (New Arts Front) as a vessel for the promotion of the work of those artists who had previously been bound by fascist rule. During this time, he also met and befriended Pablo Picasso. Their friendship would last until Picasso's death in 1973. Socio-political themes dominated Guttuso's work during this area, depicting the day-to-day lives of peasants and blue-collar workers. In 1950, he was given the World Council of Peace Prize in Warsaw. Guttuso later received the Lenin Piece Prize in 1972. =Later career= In 1938 Guttuso met Mimise Dotti, whom he married in 1956. Poet Pablo Neruda was a witness at their wedding. Mimise would become his confidant and model. After the liberation of Italy from Nazi Germans he finished \\"Muratori in riposo\\" (\\"Workers resting\\"), an artwork in china ink and watercolour of 1945, a symbol of rebirth of which Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote in 1962: The shapes of ten workers emerge white over white masonry the noon is that of the summer. But the humiliated flesh projects a shadow; is the disarranged order of the white colors, that is faithfully followed by the black ones. The noon is a peaceful one. In the following years Guttuso painted \\"Peasant Who Hoes\\" (1947) and \\"Peasants of Sicily\\" (1951) in which pictorial language became clear and free of all superfluous elements. Guttuso wrote that those were preparatory sketches for \\"Occupation of uncultivated lands of Sicily\\", exhibited in the Venice Biennale in 1950, asserting: > I believe that these are legacies to my deeper and remote inspiration. To my > childhood, to my people, my peasants, my father land-surveyor, the garden of > lemons and oranges, to the gardens of the latitude familiar to my eye and my > feeling, where I was born. Sicilian peasants who hold the primary position > in my heart, because I am one of them, whose faces come in front of my eyes > no matter what I do, Sicilian peasants so important in the history of Italy. In 1950 Guttuso joined the project of the Verzocchi collection (in the civic Pinacoteca of Forl√¨), sending a self-portrait, and the works \\"Sicilian labourer\\", \\"Bagheria on the Gulf of Palermo\\" and \\"Battle of the Bridge of the Admiral\\". In the latter he depicted his grandfather Ciro as a Garibaldine soldier. Guttuso also painted a series from life about the fight of the peasants for the occupation of lands, the zolfatari, or glimpses of landscape between cactus and prickly pears, as well as portraits of men of culture like Nino Garajo and Bruno Caruso. Fascinated by Dante's model, in 1961 he made a series of colour drawings, published in 1970, as Il Dante di Guttuso, depicting the characters of Hell as examples of human history, confirming the versatility of his talent. In the late 1960s and 1970s he completed a suite of paintings devoted to the feminine figure, a motif that became as dominant in his painting as it was in his life: \\"Donne stanze paesaggi, oggetti\\" (1967) was followed by a series of portraits of Marta Marzotto, his preferred muse of many years. His most famous \\"palermitano\\" painting is the \\"Vucciria\\" (the name of Palermo's market), in which, with raw and bloody realism, he expressed one of the many spirits of the Sicilian city. Mimise Dotti-Guttuso died on 6 October 1986. Guttuso was soon to follow his wife. He died in Rome of lung cancer at the age of 75 on 18 January 1987. On his deathbed, he allegedly embraced again the Christian faith with which he had been critical. However, there are doubts as to what really happened‚Äîin his last months, when he was bedridden, a circle of politicians and priests excluded his oldest friends from his villa. He donated many of his works to his hometown Bagheria, which are now housed in the museum of the Villa Cattolica. After speculation about who would be the rightful owner of the painter's work, two prosecutors were appointed to settle the dispute between Guttuso's nephew, his adopted son (who had been adopted only four months before Guttuso's death, was 32 years old, and already had a natural father), his longtime lady friend Marta Marzotto, Rome's Museum of Modern Art, along with an assortment of other slighted acquaintances to high-ranking government and church officials.Schmetzer, Uli (10 February 1987) \\"Artist's Death as Controversial as His Life.\\" Chicago Tribune File:Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Varese, 1961) - BEIC 6328459.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Roma, 1969) - BEIC 6363483.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Italia, 1961) - BEIC 6336573.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Italia, 1962) - BEIC 6361556.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Roma, 1969) - BEIC 6341403.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Roma, 1969) - BEIC 6363480.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Torino, 1961) - BEIC 6336688.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Varese, 1961) - BEIC 6328461.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Varese, 1961) - BEIC 6336754.jpg File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Bologna, 1969) - BEIC 6362112.jpg References External links *Renato Guttuso and the Language of his Painting Review of a 2003/2004 exhibition. *Laboratorio arte e letteratura:Renato Guttuso On a 2005 show relating Guttuso to Alberto Moravia, Elio Vittorini, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. * Review of the exhibition Guttuso.

Also, for the first time, the royal seal (anulo) was mentioned. During his rule there was significant activity of the Hungarians in the vicinity of his realm. In the late 9th century the Hungarians crossed the Carpathians and entered the Carpathian Basin.Gyula Krist√≥, Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History - 9-14th centuries They invaded northern Italy and also defeated Duke Braslav from the Duchy of Pannonia, endangering Croatia. During Muncimir's reign, the exiled Prince Petar Gojnikoviƒá of the Serbian House of Vlastimiroviƒá that stayed in Croatia returned to Rascia and seized power there. Prince Petar exiled his cousins who were pretenders to the Grand Princely throne: Pribislav, Bran and Stefan; whom Muncimir received and put under his protection.De Administrando Imperio, XXXII. Of the Serbs and of the country they now dwell in He was succeeded by Tomislav, first king of Croatia. The family relationship between Muncimir and Tomislav is unknown; Tomislav was probably Muncimir's son.

Pyrolysis is defined as \\"a thermochemical decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen‚Äù.

It is easily made on a small scale making it accessible and popular in the domestic sphere and while cooking on campfires. Usually, it is made by packing a swatch of fabric into a small, almost airtight, rectangular tin and heating it over coals for a long period of time, allowing it to undergo thermal decomposition. It can be ignited by a single spark that can in turn be used to ignite a tinder bundle to start a fire. Depending on its source material and completeness of char, its autoignition temperature is between and . It is sometimes manufactured at home for use as the initial tinder when cooking or camping and historically usually provided the \\"tinder\\" component of a tinderbox. It is often made by putting cloth into an almost airtight tin with a small hole in it, and cooking it in campfire coals until the smoking slows and the cloth is properly charred. It is the equivalent of wood being made into charcoal and uses the same techniques. Char cloth ignites with even the smallest spark and hold a very hot ember, and is therefore commonly used with a flint and steel and fire piston.

It is based upon the novel Elephant Walk by \\"Robert Standish\\", the pseudonym of the English novelist Digby George Gerahty (1898‚Äì1981). With many sections filmed on location it features several true life insights into the operation of tea plantations and the tea-making process within factories. It also looks at native ceremonies and beliefs. Most of the story centres upon the Elephant Walk Bungalow and the production of Elephant Walk Tea. Background It was originally intended to star the husband and wife team of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh (with Olivier in the Finch role). But Olivier was already committed to the project The Beggar's Opera (1953). Leigh was enthusiastic about the role and continued in her husband's absence, but she was forced to withdraw from production shortly after filming began in Colombo, Ceylon, as a result of bipolar disorder. According to Leonard Maltin's annual Movie Guide book, Leigh can be seen in some long shots that were not re-filmed after Elizabeth Taylor replaced her. Plot Colonial tea planter John Wiley, visiting England at the end of World War II, weds Ruth and takes her home to Elephant Walk Bungalow, the plantation house built by his father in Ceylon. They are stopped by a bull Indian elephant on their way to the house, which a very angry John frightens away with a few gunshots. Ruth soon discovers John is still dominated by his father, \\"The Governor\\", long after the man's death; and that John's mother was never happy at Elephant Walk. In fact, she left John's father shortly after their marriage but returned when she discovered she was expecting a child; and, eventually, she died. Ruth has a strained relationship with Apphuamy, the principal servant, whose real master continues to be the late \\"Governor\\" ‚Äì to whose tomb, in the garden, Appuhamy regularly speaks, expressing his dislike of the new mistress. A room containing a very stern, larger than life portrait of \\"The Governor\\" is kept in his room, which has not been changed since the old man died ‚Äì and which is always kept locked. Appuhamy gives a sinister overtone to much of the otherwise genteel story. Ruth learns from John that Elephant Walk is so named because his father, Tom Wiley, deliberately built it across the path of migration used by a herd of elephants to reach a water source. The elephants continue to attempt to use their ancient path to get to the water, but are kept out by the walls and the defensive efforts of the servants. Thus, Ruth's initial delight with the tropical wealth and luxury of her new home is quickly tempered by her isolation as the only European woman in the district; by her husband's occasional imperious arrogance and angry outburst; by Appuhamy's polite but nonetheless insubordinate attitude toward her; by a mutual physical attraction with plantation manager Dick Carver; and by the hovering, ominous menace of the hostile elephants. The tide of Elephant Walk history turns in Ruth's favour when the district is hit by a cholera epidemic, during which she makes herself indispensable as a relief worker. Appuhamy confesses to \\"The Governor\\" that he was wrong about the new mistress, and he hopes that she will stay. But Ruth has made John realise that, as long as they stay at Elephant Walk, he will continue to be dominated by his dead father instead of becoming his own man; that they must leave. In the end, their decision is made for them when the elephants finally manage to break through the wall and stampede onto the grounds, killing Appuhamy in the process. Elephant Walk Bungalow is smashed and catches fire. The portrait of the Governor is seen burning, symbolising the end of the old regime. John and Ruth manage to escape as the house begins to collapse around them. Dick Carver sees them together in the hills just above the house and realises Ruth will never be his. As John and Ruth look down upon Elephant Walk burning to the ground, it begins to rain. \\"I'm sorry\\", she says. \\"I'm not\\", he replies. \\"Let them have their Elephant Walk. Ruth, we'll build a new place ‚Äì a home ‚Äì somewhere else!\\" The bull elephant which appeared on the road (near the beginning of the film) raises his trunk, and gives a mighty trumpet call, as the words appear on the screen, \\"The End.\\" Cast Production The film was based on a novel published in 1949. Film rights were originally bought by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Alexander MacDonald for their production company, Dougfair. The movie was to be released through United Artists and star Fairbanks and Deborah Kerr. D. M. Marshman Jr. signed to do the script. Filming was postponed due to poor weather in Ceylon. Fairbanks and MacDonald then decided to transfer the rights over to Paramount, where Irving Asher was given the job of producing. John Lee Mahin was hired to write the script and William Dieterle to direct. Paramount wanted Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh to play the lead roles. Olivier ended up having too many theatre commitments, but Leigh agreed to star; Olivier was replaced by his protege Peter Finch, with Dana Andrews playing the other male lead. Filming began in Ceylon in February 1953. After four weeks of location work the unit moved to Hollywood for six weeks of studio filming. However, Vivien Leigh missed filming on the second day. She eventually dropped out of the picture altogether, claiming an acute nervous breakdown. Elizabeth Taylor was borrowed from MGM to replace her. Critical reception Maltin gave the film 2 stars out of 4, and made one of his pithier critiques: \\"Pachyderm stampede climax comes none too soon.\\" A major plot element in the film is that the tea plantation's manor, where the film's action occurs, had been built in the middle of a path that migrating Indian elephants had previously used.

A former national serviceman in the Royal Air Force as a motorcycle despatch rider, he was also a member of the RAF scrambling team. Horseracing McCain applied for a training permit in 1953 and began training horses in 1962, using small stables behind the showroom of his used-car store in his hometown of Southport. He bought a horse for 6,000 guineas that turned out to be suffering from a debilitating bone disease. The horse was Red Rum. McCain trained the winner of the Grand National steeplechase four times, three times in the 1970s with Red Rum and a fourth time in 2004 with Amberleigh House. His first and fourth victories were over 30 years apart. The 1973 Grand National was a duel of nine minutes two seconds between Red Rum and Crisp, with L'Escargot (a previous double Cheltenham Gold Cup winner and future 1975 Grand National winner) well beaten in third place. The winning time broke the course record that had stood for nearly 40 years and remained unbeaten until it was bettered by Mr Frisk in the 1990 Grand National immediately after a number of safety changes sped up the course for that year. In 2009 four Guardian journalists compiled a list of six Grand National moments and selected the 1973 Grand National battle as number one. George Dockeray and Fred Rimell are the only other people to train four winners of the Grand National. In his final Grand National in 2006, McCain entered three horses: Inca Trail, who ran well for a long way until running out of stamina two fences from home and finishing eighth; Ebony Light, who fell; and Amberleigh House, who was pulled up. McCain retired after the 2006 National, handing over control of the stable to his son, Donald, Jr., who trained 2011 National winner Ballabriggs. After watching the 2011 Grand National, where there were two equine fatalities, McCain expressed concern that the lowering of the fences in aid of safety was having the opposite impact through speeding up the race and increasing the risk of equine fatalities. Following further fatalities in the 2012 Grand National, a far cry from the lower equine fatalities of the 1950s and 1960s (apart from four equine fatalities at the 1954 Grand National and where there was an unusually small field of runners), these concerns are being increasingly openly expressed by other National Hunt and Grand National experts, and the wisdom of the approach to improving safety from the 1989 Grand National onwards is coming under close scrutiny. Personal life McCain married Beryl Harris in Southport in March 1961; the couple had two children: Joanne and Donald, Jr.Ginger McCain: Mr Aintree , The Independent, 8 April 2006 McCain worked as a taxi driver to supplement his income as a trainer prior to finding Grand National success. It was as a taxi driver that he became acquainted with Noel le Mare, on whose behalf Red Rum was purchased. Death McCain died from cancer on 19 September 2011, two days before his 81st birthday. On the opening day of the 2012 Grand National a bronze statue of McCain was unveiled at Aintree Racecourse looking down on the winning post where his victories unfolded.

They are the patron saints of Milan and of haymakers and are invoked for the discovery of thieves. Their feast day in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church is 19 June, the day marking the translation of their relics. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and in the Eastern Rites of the Catholic Church, their feast takes place on 14 October (O.S.)/24 October (N.S.), the traditional day of their death. In Christian iconography their emblems are the scourge, the club and the sword. Legend The acta\\"Acta Sanctorum\\" June, IV, 680 and 29. may have been expanded from a letter (Epistle liii) to the bishops of Italy, falsely ascribed to Saint Ambrose. They are written in a very simple style; it has not been possible to establish the date of their composition. According to these, Gervasius and Protasius were the twin sons of martyrs. Their father, Saint Vitalis of Milan, a man of consular dignity, suffered martyrdom at Ravenna, possibly under Nero. Their mother, Saint Valeria, died for her faith at Milan. Gervasius and Protasius were imprisoned, and visited in prison by Saint Nazarius. The sons are said to have large hands and had been scourged and then beheaded, during the reign of the Emperor Nero, under the presidency of Anubinus or Astasius, and while Caius was Bishop of Milan. Some authors place the martyrdom under the Emperor Diocletian, but others object to this time, because it is not clear how, in that case, the place of burial, and even the names, could be forgotten by the time of Saint Ambrose, as is stated. It probably occurred during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180).Mershman, Francis. \\"Sts. Gervasius and Protasius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 24 Jan. 2014 Ambrose and Saints Gervasius and Protasius Gervasius and Protasius, by Philippe de Champaigne Saint Ambrose, in 386, had built a magnificent basilica at Milan, now called the Basilica Sant'Ambrogio. Asked by the people to consecrate it in the same solemn manner as was done in Rome, he promised to do so if he could obtain the necessary relics. In a dream, he was shown the place where such relics could be found. He ordered excavations to be made outside the city, in the cemetery Church of Saints Nabor and Felix, who were at the time the primary patrons of Milan, and there found the relics of Saints Gervasius and Protasius. In a letter, St Ambrose wrote: \\"I found the fitting signs, and on bringing in some on whom hands were to be laid, the power of the holy martyrs became so manifest, that even whilst I was still silent, one was seized and thrown prostrate at the holy burial-place. We found two men of marvelous stature, such as those of ancient days. All the bones were perfect, and there was much blood.\\"Letter of St. Ambrose of Milan on the discovery of the Relics of Sts. Gervasius and Protasius St Ambrose had their relics removed to the Basilica of Fausta (now the Church of Saints Vitalis and Agricola),Letter of Ambrose of Milan on the and on the next day into the basilica, accompanied in the texts by many miracles, emblematic of divine favor in the context of the great struggle then taking place between St Ambrose and the Arian Empress Justina.D. H. Williams, \\"Ambrose of Milan and the End of the Arian-Nicene Conflicts,\\" Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995 discusses the \\"inventio\\" and \\"depositio\\" of the relics as thecrowning gesture of Ambrose's triumph over the Arians. Of the vision, the subsequent discovery of the relics and the accompanying miracles, St Ambrose wrote to his sister Marcellina. Saint Augustine, not yet baptized, claims to have witnessed these events and relates them in his \\"Confessions\\" (IX, vii), and in \\"De Civitate Dei\\" (XXII, viii) as well as in his \\"Sermon 286 in natal. Ss. Mm. Gerv. et Prot.\\". They are also alleged by Saint Paulinus in his life of Saint Ambrose. The latter died in 397 and by his own wish was buried in his basilica by the side of these martyrs. It has been suggested that the Brescia Casket was made for or used to hold the relics. Veneration Sant'Ambrogio basilica.

Rendel Harris, in \\"The Dioscuri in the Christian Legends\\" (London, 1903), addressed the subject of twin saints in Christian legend, who seem to be connected with the Dioscuri, whose cult was tenacious, surmised from an oration decrying their veneration by Dio Chrystostom (\\"Orations\\" 61.11). The historicity of Gervasius and Protasius was defended in the \\"Analecta Bollandist.\\" (1904), XXIII, 427. Immediately after the discovery of the relics by Saint Ambrose, the cult of Saints Gervasius and Protasius was spread in Italy, churches were built in their honor at Pavia, Nola and other places. In Gaul (modern-day France), Around the year 400 churches were dedicated to them, at Mans, Rouen and Soissons. At the Louvre in Paris, there is now a famous picture of the saints by Lesueur (d. 1655), which was formerly in their church, Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais in Paris. According to the \\"Liber Pontificalis,\\" Pope Innocent I (402-417) dedicated a church to them at Rome. Later, the name of St Vitalis, their father, was added to the title of this church (Basilica of San Vitale). Very early on, their names were inserted into the Litany of the Saints. In 835, Angilbert II, Bishop of Milan, placed the relics of the three saints in a porphyry sarcophagus, where they were found in January 1864.Civilt√† Cattolica, 1864, IX, 608, and XII, 345 A tradition claims that, after the destruction of Milan by Frederick Barbarossa, his chancellor, Rainald of Dassel, had taken the relics from Milan and deposited them at Breisach in Germany, whence some came to Soissons. The claim is rejected by Milan.Biraghi, Civilt√† Cattolica, 1864, IX, 608, and XII, 345. Nevertheless, they were venerated by farmers in Germany and a German saying amongst harvesters was: \\"Wenn's regnet auf Gervasius / es vierzig Tage regnen muss\\" (\\"When it rains on St Gervasius' Day / forty days of rain will follow\\").Gervasius - √ñkumenisches Heiligenlexikon Thus, as with the cults of Saint Swithun, Saint Medard, the Seven Sleepers, and Saint Godelieve, that of Sts Gervasius and Protasius was connected with the weather.

Definitions A traffic mix is a modelisation of user behaviour. In telecommunications, user behaviour activities may be described by a number of systems, ranging from simple to complex. For example, for plain old telephone service (POTS), a sequence of connection requests to an exchange can be modelled by fitting negative exponential distributions to the average time between requests and the average duration of a connection. This in turn can be used to work out the utilisation of the line for the purposes of network planning and dimensioning. Objectives Traffic mix has two goals: * Network links dimensioning * Network equipment dimensioning Both these functions are extremely important to network operators. If insufficient capability is deployed at a node (for example, if a backbone router has 1 gigabit/sec of switching capacity and more than this is offered) then the risk of equipment failure increases, and customers experience poor service. However, if the network is overprovisioned the cost in equipment can be high. Most providers therefore seek to maximise the effect of their spending by maintaining an unused overhead capacity for growth, and expanding key nodes to relieve problem areas. Identification of these areas is accomplished by network dimensioning.

The commercial was produced by Benton and Bowles advertising agency, written and art directed by Peter West and Guy Winston and produced by Simon Wells. The director was Bob Mahoney. Although the Shake n' Vac product was on sale in shops in 1979, ITV industrial action of 1979 resulted in the television advert being delayed until 1980. The jingle was in a 1950s rock and roll retro style, a style very popular in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s.

His tenure, during which the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese, was at a time of growth in the city, which he matched with the most rapid church expansion in the history of New Orleans. More new parishes were established in New Orleans under his episcopacy than at any other time. Early life and education Antoine Blanc was born in Sury, near Sury-le-Comtal, then in the Department of Rh√¥ne-et-Loire, France. He attended the seminary at Sury-le-Comtal and was ordained in 1816. On 1 July 1817 he embarked from Bordeaux with Louis William Valentine Dubourg Bishop of the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas, who had traveled to Europe to recruit clergy. They arrived in Annapolis, Maryland in September. Blanc and a number of seminarians stayed with Charles Carroll of Carrollton until the end of October when they joined Dubourg in Baltimore. From Baltimore, they travelled on foot to Pittsburgh, the stage proving too dangerous. From there, they took a flatboat to Louisville, Kentucky, arriving on 30 November. They reached Bardstown, Kentucky on 2 December. Missioner The following April, Blanc and Father Jeanjean were assigned to the mission at Vincennes, Indiana. Father Jeanjean was soon recalled. Blanc proceeded to build a log chapel at a French settlement on the Illinois side of the Wabash, about twelve miles from Vincennes. Dubourg lent Blanc's services to Benedict Joseph Flaget, Bishop of the Diocese of Bardstown, whose area included most of Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. In February 1820, Blanc was recalled to New Orleans, and then assigned first to Natchez, then St. Francis Chapel at Point Coupee, Louisiana, with its mission chapels in the Felicianas and the Plains on the east side of the Mississippi River) and then at St. Joseph Church in Baton Rouge. In 1827, Blanc, Armand Duplantier, Fulwar Skipwith, Thomas B. Robertson and S√©bastien Hiriart received permission from the state legislature to organize a corporation called the Agricultural Society of Baton Rouge.A general digest of the acts of the legislature of Louisiana, Vol II accessed 1 July 2012 Bishop In December 1831, Bishop De Neckere appointed Balance associate vicar-general of the diocese of New Orleans. Bishop De Necker died in 1833, and Blanc was appointed administrator until October 1835 when he received the bulls naming him Bishop of New Orleans. Blanc's jurisdiction included the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, to which Texas was added in 1838. Later the territory was reduced when the diocese of Mississippi was established. In 1853 the Diocese of Natchitoches was founded in the northern part of Louisiana. Growth in New Orleans and the region took all of Blanc's attention. In 1850 the Diocese of New Orleans was raised to an archdiocese, and Blanc became its first archbishop. St. Louis Cathedral remained its cathedral. Monsignor Blanc invited the Jesuits and Lazarites to Louisiana to establish seminaries for the training of priests. He also invited the Redemptorists and the Christian Brothers. He also wanted to establish convents and schools for girls and invited the Sisters of Charity, the Sisters of Notre Dame, the Good Shepherd Sisters, and the congregations of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and of the Holy Cross. These new communities of Catholic workers helped the communities and took care of their populations during epidemics and other trials. Blanc also devoted resources and attention to the lives of enslaved people. The new religious also supported the new congregations of English-speaking American migrants and Irish immigrants who had become established in New Orleans and the states since the Louisiana Purchase. By 1832 New Orleans had grown to be the fourth-largest city in the nation after New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.\\"New Orleans, Louisiana\\", Catholic Encyclopedia, accessed 14 July 2008 The crisis of a yellow fever epidemic resulted in fatalities of 5% of the population of New Orleans. Blanc died in 1860 in New Orleans while still in office. Legacy and honors Blanc's institution building during the rapid growth of New Orleans and the states resulted in the number of churches increasing from 26 to 73, and of priests from 27 to 92. Under his leadership, many schools, academies, colleges, convents, and asylums were established. *The Archbishop Antoine Blanc Memorial at 1100 Chartres Street was named in his honor and holds the archives of the archdiocese. *The Archbishop Antoine Blanc Assembly # 2047 of the Knights of Columbus, located in New Roads, LA is named in his honor.
