The takeover made The Stars Group, then called Amaya, the world's biggest publicly listed online gambling company.

In March 2016, following charges by Canadian regulators with multiple securities fraud charges, he took an indefinite leave of absence, and resigned in August. On June 6, 2018, the Court of Quebec ordered a Stay of the Proceedings brought by the Authorite Des Marches Financiers (Canada) against David Baazov. The Supreme Court of Canada states that a stay of proceedings is the \\"ultimate remedy,\\" which prevents the court from ever adjudicating the matter. A Stay of Proceedings under Canadian law is the equivalent to a dismissal with prejudice under U.S. law. On December 20, 2016, Baazov dropped a bid to buy the company with a \\"virtually unknown\\" group of outside investors, one of whom denied being involved. In December 2015, a Kentucky court ordered that Amaya pay $870 million in penalties to cover alleged losses by the state's residents who played real-money poker on the PokerStars website between 2006 and 2011. In December 2018, the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned this $870 million judgment on the grounds that the state lacked standing to claim damages under the Loss Recovery Act, which \\"was never intended to be used in this fashion.\\" Current CEO Rafi Ashkenazi became Interim Chief Executive Officer of The Stars Group, then Amaya, in March 2016 and then permanent Chief Executive Officer in November, 2016.

It was founded on May 19, 1922, to \\"encourage high scholastic achievement and fellowship among students in pharmacy and to promote the pharmaceutical sciences\\". History The organization evolved from the Aristolochite Society which had been established at the University of Michigan as a local honor society in 1908. Discussion of national expansion began in 1917, met with urging at that same time from pharmacy faculty, which resulted in a second chapter of Aristolochite being established in 1919 at what is now Oregon State University, and a third at the University of Oklahoma. The Society adopted the name Rho Chi Society that year, with the grant of a charter from the State of Michigan.Rho Chi Bylaws and History, from the Œ°Œß National Website, accessed 11 June 2014 Further support was provided by an American Conference of Pharmaceutical Faculties committee chaired by Zada Mary Cooper in 1920‚Äì1921. In a show of support for the new honor society, Alpha chapter of Phi Delta Chi provided substantial support for Rho Chi. Rho Chi's first president, vice- president and treasurer had all been members of Phi Delta Chi, the Professional Pharmaceutical Sciences Fraternity, also established at Michigan.According to the timeline of milestones on the Phi Delta Chi website, accessed 30 Mar 2020. The society grew slowly at first, with eight chapters by 1927, and ten more over the next five years. Expansion continued more rapidly, resulting in a chapter count of 110 as of 2014, and 128 by 2019 (according to the society's website). Rho Chi Society was admitted to membership in the Association of College Honor Societies, or ACHS, in 1947. Government is by convention, held annually in conjunction with the meeting of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. The 1991 edition of Baird's Manual noted the Society had 46,500 initiates, while by 2019 ACHS records note 113,646 initiates. Chapters The Society has established 135 chapters since 1922, most of which remain active. Membership requirements Undergraduates eligible for election as active members of a chapter must have completed a minimum of 75 hours of scholastic work, be ranked in the upper 20 percent of their class, and have attained a scholastic average equivalent to the second highest letter grade. They must also show a \\"capacity for achievement in the science and art of pharmacy as evidenced by character, personality and leadership.\\" Provisions are made for graduate students and faculty to join, with the intent that chapters encourage all levels of membership. Scholarships The Society seeks to encourage research in pharmacy. In 1972 it established a first-year graduate scholarship. In 1992, the first-year graduate scholarship was awarded in conjunction with the American Foundation for Pharmaceutical Education (AFPE) Board of Grants. This scholarship is awarded, on a competitive basis, to a student in the final year of professional studies or to a member who has completed professional studies. Only members of the Rho Chi Society who enter graduate programs in accredited schools/colleges of pharmacy leading to the Ph.D. degree are eligible to win. In 2003 a similar post-doctoral clinical research scholarship was established and is likewise administered by the Rho Chi Scholarship Committee. This Scholarship is awarded to a Rho Chi member entering the second year of fellowship training. In addition to these, small cash awards are presented to chapters who are selected in the annual Chapter Awards Program, based upon competitive theme entries suggested each year by the Society's Executive Council and/or sustained activities of the chapter. Publications From 1933-1993, the Society published its annual report, \\"The Report of Rho Chi\\", containing complete accounts of the activities of the Executive Council, the National Office, and local chapters. It distributed the Report in print versions to both collegiate and honorary members. Although the Report of Rho Chi is no longer printed, the content is nonetheless published through the Society's website, www.rhochi.org. A historical study, called \\"The Rho Chi Society\\", written by Roy A. Bowers and David L. Cowen, was first issued by the Society in 1955 in cooperation with the American Institute of the History of Pharmacy. This work was first published in the American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education (1955;19:244-284). A fifth revision, edited by Robert A. Buerki, published in 1992 is the current edition. Rho Chi plans to publish future editions through the Society's website. The Society maintains a website with information for chapters, alumni and institutions. Members and guests are welcome to visit the site or to contact the National Office through e-mail for further information. Traditions The badge of the Rho Chi Society is an old-fashioned key, incorporating the Greek Letters Œ°Œß in a specific configuration, raised on an oblong eight-sided base. The Greek letters, \\"Rho\\" and \\"Chi,\\" were originally selected because, when placed in the relative position in which they are found on the Rho Chi Key, they are emblematic of the prescription sign. The colors attached to the seal of membership were chosen to indicate the royalty of purple and the loyalty of white. The eight sides of the Key, although they have had different meanings in the past, now represent chemistry, biology, physiology, pharmaceutics, pharmacology, and the biomedical, social/administrative, and clinical sciences. The motto of Rho Chi is \\"To advance practice and pharmaceutical sciences through the encouragement and recognition of sound scholarship.\\" Notes References * External links * * ACHS Rho Chi entry * Rho Chi chapter list at ACHS Category:Association of College Honor Societies Category:Honor societies Category:Student organizations established in 1922 Category:1922 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Rho Chi"},{"id":"43040693","text":"David Shofet is an Iranian-American rabbi.

This is largely in response to the tendency of modern audiences to time shift programming (DVR) or view using on- demand streaming services, which has produced a steady decline in live viewership ratings. Live episodes have long been a staple of television programming, but the shift towards event television has greatly accelerated development of new styles of \\"DVR-proof\\" programming and new methods of marketing in response to the growth of these new technologies. Networks are focusing on more live entertainment and investing into more sports programming, which are less attractive to DVR users, but excite and engage live viewers. Scripted programs have adopted the strategy as well, by making more frequent use of sudden, unannounced plot twists or major character deaths. \\"It's important to keep your fans engaged\\", CBS entertainment president Nina Tassler said. \\"You keep eventizing your entire season.\\" Event television often makes use of interactive ways to encourage live viewer participation, such as voting for contestants and results shows, interactive media such as mobile apps, viral marketing, or hashtags. Series and specials that have been referred to as \\"event television\\" include: * The Day of the Doctor ‚Äì The 50th anniversary special of Doctor Who which was simulcast globally in November 2013. * The X Factor * The Jay Leno Show * Strictly Come Dancing * 24: Live Another Day * Twin Peaks: The Return * The Sound of Music Live!

Starting in the 1960s, it was also used to describe certain \\"must watch\\" programs created for television which significantly altered viewer habits for a short time, drawing them to a particular channel for a night or even \\"emptying the streets and pubs\\" during their duration.

Early life Platte was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1936 and grew up in Westphalia, Michigan, graduating from St. Mary's High School in Westphalia in 1953 as its valedictorian. She entered the Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids in 1954, at the age of 18, and after her novitiate studied at Aquinas College operated by them in Grand Rapids, Michigan to train as a schoolteacher. In 1967, she founded the St. Joseph Alternative Education Center in Saginaw, Michigan, a school for children who had been denied access to other institutions. In 1995, Platte moved to Jonah House in Baltimore, Maryland, where she took part in Plowshares actions. Platte served on the Saginaw City Council from 1977 t0 1985.Nun And Activist Ardeth Platte Dead At 84 Activism In 2000, Platte, along with two other members of her religious congregation, Sisters Jackie Hudson, O.P., and Carol Gilbert, O.P., illegally entered Peterson Air Force Base and sprayed a fighter plane with their own blood. The three women were arrested and held in prison until the charges were dropped. In 2002, the same trio entered a Minuteman III missile silo in Colorado. They wore white jump suits bearing the words \\"Citizen Weapon Inspection Team\\", and proceeded to pray in front of the silo as they poured their own blood on it in the shape of a cross. The sisters were arrested and had to wait lying on the ground for hours. They continued protesting into their pre-trial hearing; wearing full religious habits, the Sisters answered the judge by nodding without speaking. At the start of their trial, Robert E. Blackburn, the presiding judge, granted an in limine motion to the prosecutor, which prevented the sisters from arguing that their actions were legal under international law and the Nuremberg defense. They were sentenced to between 30 and 41 months in prison. Platte was released from prison on December 22, 2005. She was not due to be released until May 31 of the next year, but a judge took into consideration the time she had already served, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. She then served three more years of probation. She is considered a terrorist by the Maryland State Police.

The most important of these is the Global Terrorism Database, a database of over 113,000 terrorist attacks from 1970 till 2015, excluding the year 1993 (as of July 2016). START also hosts the MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base, now known as the Terrorist Organization Profiles, but does not actively maintain or take responsibility for the data. Major Projects =Social Media Use during Disasters= Social Media Use during Disasters is a research project that was conducted from July 2012 to October 2013, and it is one of the major contributions by the START research center to the risk communication field. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter are used to collect and distribute information quickly and easily. Because of this function of social media, it is being used as a tool to communicate about disasters. ‚ÄúGiven the growing importance of social media as a disaster communication tool, it is vital to understand how individuals use, behave, and interpret information on social media sites to better inform policy, guidance, and operations and to ensure that emergency managers, first responders, and policy makers can best optimize how they use these tools.‚Äù.Liu, B. (2013). Social Media Use During Disasters [Abstract]. National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism A random sample of 2,015 U.S. residents participated in this study. The participants were asked to imagine that a disaster involving multiple terrorist attacks was unfolding. The participants were then presented with information from both local and national sources about the disaster through Facebook posts and tweets. Participants were then asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their responses to the information. The study found that the source of the information impacted its perceived credibility. However, the source alone did not influence participants‚Äô likelihood of taking recommended action. The study also showed that after participants were exposed to the information they were more likely to communicate that information through interpersonal channels rather than through organizational media channels. Finally, the study also showed that demographics such as gender and age affected how participants responded to the information. =Training in Risk and Crisis Communication= Training in Risk and Crisis Communication (TRACC) is another major contribution by START to the risk communication field. TRACC is a curriculum presented by the START research center for the benefit of organizations. TRACC is separated into 3 modules that aim to train organizations on how to properly communicate crisis information before, during, and after the crisis situation. ‚ÄúTRACC is a unique curriculum that is research-based and covers the entire life-cycle of a crisis including preparation, response and recovery.\\" Liu, B., Petrun, E., & Izsak, K. (2013). Training in Risk and Crisis Communication [Abstract]. National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism =Organizational Dimensions of Risk Communication during Homeland Security Crises= The START research center also completed a project titled Organizational Dimensions of Risk Communication during Homeland Security Crises. This project focuses on risk communication at the organizational level by ‚Äúexploring how communications within and among organizations affect risk management and risk communication about bioterrorism.\\" Chess, C. (2009). Organizational Dimensions of Risk Communication during Homeland Security Crisis [Abstract]. National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism This project aims to improve communication about bioterrorism between organizations and their public. For this study, researchers focused on the anthrax attacks of 2001. The researchers conducted over 50 interviews with local people who were in positions with agency such as law enforcement officers, elected officials, and health professionals. Researchers asked the participants to describe how decisions were made in their organizations and how information was communicated from their organizations. Forms of written communication such as electronic correspondence and reports were also analyzed. This study produced 5 major findings. The first is ‚ÄúOrganizations faced both technical and social uncertainties.\\" These uncertainties included that the authorities in the situation were unclear, and these uncertainties negatively affected risk communication. The second major finding of this study is ‚ÄúOrganizational networks were essential for risk communication to the public and workers.\\" This means that successful risk communication depends on how effective the communication process is between agencies. The third major finding is ‚ÄúRelationships among local professional first responders and public health agencies were often constructive.\\" Informal methods of communication between law enforcement officers and health professionals help facilitate communication to the public. The fourth major finding is, ‚ÄúCommunication problems resulted from lack of communication triage.\\" This means that organizations did not prioritize their many audiences or their channels for reaching those audiences. The fifth and final major finding is, ‚ÄúThe concept of elite panic needs further conceptualizing and research.\\" Researchers noticed the concept of elite panic during the interview analysis process. Elite panic is the idea that the unfounded fears felt by the social and financial elite, such as the fear that working-class people will commit violent crimes during a disaster rather than helping their neighbors, drives some responses to disasters. This concept needs to be better understood to improve crisis communication.

Background and service under Qian Liu  Cao Hongda was born in 882, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang. His father Cao Gui (ÊõπÂú≠) was a general under Qian Liu, who would eventually control the region (modern Zhejiang) that became the territory of Wuyue. Cao Hongda was born at Linping (Ëá®Âπ≥, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). After he grew older, Cao Gui wanted to train him physically, so Cao Gui had him eat with servants and not be given warm clothing even when it was in the winter. Cao Gui also had him lift bricks daily. After Cao Hongda grew yet older, he became a guard at the headquarters for one of the circuits Qian controlled, Zhendong Circuit (ÈéÆÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang). At that time, his father Cao Gui served as the prefect of Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), and wanted to enter into a marital alliance with a fellow general under Qian, Chen Xun (Èô≥Ë©¢) the prefect of Mu Prefecture (Áù¶Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou) ‚Äî by having Cao Hongda marry one of Chen's daughters. He thus sent Cao Hongda on a mission to Mu, intending to have him marry Chen's daughter there. However, a fortuneteller informed Cao Hongda and/or Cao Gui, \\"The Chens are not appropriate for your marital relationship. You should marry with another family to bring glory and honor on you.\\" When he went through the Qiantang (Èå¢Â°ò, in modern Hangzhou), the capital of Qian's main circuit, Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑), Qian was impressed by Cao Hongda's appearance, and therefore gave him a younger sister in marriage. Cao Hongda thereafter successively served as the prefect of Tai Prefecture (Âè∞Â∑û, in modern Taizhou, Zhejiang), then of Chu Prefecture (ËôïÂ∑û, in modern Lishui, Zhejiang).  Service under Qian Yuanguan  Qian Liu, who then carried the title of King of Wuyue, died in 932, and was succeeded by his son Qian Yuanguan. Qian Yuanguan, who did not take the title of king but only that of military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenhai and Zhendong initially (as a vassal to Later Tang), put Cao Hongda in charge of the affairs of the state ‚Äî effectively, to be chancellor, although not with that title as Qian Yuanguan was not claiming, at that point, statehood.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. When Qian Yuanguan claimed the title of king in 937 (then as a vassal of Later Tang's successor state Later Jin), he commissioned Cao, along with Shen Song and Pi Guangye, chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. (It was probably at this time that he changed his name to Cao Zhongda, as the name change was said to be to observe naming taboo for Qian Yuanguan's heir apparent Qian Hongzun, and it was at the time that Qian Yuanguan claimed the king title that he made Qian Hongzun his heir apparent.) He was said to be kind and honest, often donating food to the needy (implicitly, referring probably to Buddhist monks). Qian Yuanguan honored him greatly and referred to him only as \\"the Chancellor\\" rather than by name.  Service under Qian Hongzuo  Qian Yuanguan died in 941 and was succeeded as king by his son (Qian Hongzun's younger brother) Qian Hongzuo ‚Äî as Qian Hongzun had died earlier. During Qian Hongzuo's mourning period, Cao Zhongda served as regent. When there was subsequently a disturbance among the army ranks where the soldiers claimed that there was unfairness in the rewards given to them, Cao personally met the soldiers to comfort them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282.

It is a herbivore and constructs a tubular nest-like home on a blade of the sporophyte of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. This home is made by rolling the sides of the blade together and securing them with silk. As the kelp blade grows, so the nest is advanced down the blade towards the base, approximately keeping pace with the algal growth. Distribution Peramphithoe femorata has been reported from the Caribbean Sea, Venezuela and the Southern Ocean. Behaviour Peramphithoe femorata is a tubicolous (tube- forming) amphipod that feeds and makes its home on the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. This brown alga is found in shallow water and can grow to a length of in a single season. It is attached to the substrate by a holdfast from which grow several long slender stems. These are clad in numerous small leaf- like blades growing from pneumatocysts (gas-filled bladders) and it is on these blades that the amphipod lives. The blades grow continuously from near their bases and the amphipod chooses a position some way along a blade, rolling the edges together to form a tube. It first deposits a mass of silk on the blade and grips this with its 5th, 6th and 7th pereopods. It then secures the edges of the blade to each other with a silken thread, produced from glands on the third and fourth pairs of pereopods, manipulating the thread with the first and second pairs. The weaving process continues rhythmically at the rate of about 24 silk attachments per minute, alternately on the left and right sides of the blade, and a tube is formed. The meristem from which the blade grows is just above the junction with the pneumatocyst. The rate of elongation of the blade decreases over time and for about six days the nest is extended towards the base of the blade at about the same rate as the blade is growing. After that the rate of growth of the blade slows down further and the rate of nest advancement becomes more variable. At the entrance of the nest (the end nearest the base of the blade) the surface layer of the blade is grazed by the amphipod while at the other end of the nest the central tissue of the blade is also consumed. The oldest part of the blade becomes senescent and sloughs off. The amphipod does not occupy the nest continuously but sometimes moves elsewhere on the host kelp, leaving a small grazing scar to show where it has foraged. Sometimes the nest is abandoned and a new nest may be built in a different location. Researchers studying this amphipod (Cerda, Hinojosa & Thiel, 2012) hypothesised that the position chosen for the nest might be a location where the maximum nutritional value of the tissue coincided with a decrease in production of defensive chemicals by the alga.

The battle was part of the Northeast Coast Campaign (1703) during Queen Anne's War. Background The border area between Acadia and New England in the early 18th century remained contested after battles between French and English colonists (and their allied Native Americans) during King William's War in the 1690s failed to resolve territorial disputes. New France defined the western border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in what is now southern Maine,William Williamson. The history of the state of Maine. Vol. 2. 1832. p. 27; ; Campbell, Gary. The Road to Canada: The Grand Communications Route from Saint John to Quebec. Goose Lane Editions and The New Brunswick Heritage Military Project. 2005. p. 21. while the English Province of Massachusetts Bay formally claimed all of the land between the Piscataqua and St. Croix Rivers (all of present-day Maine). During the 1670s the English had established settlements between the Kennebec River and Penobscot Bay, contesting claims by the French and the local Abenaki people to the area. The French had established Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot, and there was a French settlement of long standing in Penobscot Bay near the site of modern Castine, Maine. All of these sites had been used as bases for attacks on English settlers during King William's War.Drake, p. 36 The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by natives (primarily Abenaki and Iroquois), and the Hudson River‚ÄìLake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts. Although the Indian threat had receded somewhat due to reductions in the native population as a result of disease and the last war, they were still seen to pose a potent threat to outlying settlements.Drake, p. 150 Although war had broken out between France and England in 1702, the frontiers between New France and New England remained quiet until December of that year, when Governor-General Louis-Hector de Calli√®re authorized the Abenaki to resume the border war. In addition to any plunder reaped from expeditions against the English colonies, Calli√®re promised additional gifts. Calli√®re died in May 1703, and was replaced by Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil, who vigorously promoted raiding activity as a means to maintain French influence with the Abenaki. Vaudreuil gave Alexandre Leneuf de La Valli√®re de Beaubassin, a military officer whose family's seigneury at Beaubassin had been raided in 1696 by New England forces, command of a small contingent of French forces and instructions to organize raids against English settlements. Massachusetts Bay Governor Joseph Dudley did not believe that the Abenaki would go to war. In June 1703 Boston newspapers reported that the Abenaki were two thirds \\"for peace and one Third for warr\\", and Dudley had been unable to convince them to join the conflict on the English side.Morrison, p. 157 The Abenaki chief Moxus attempted to warn Dudley of Vaudreuil's aggressive posture, but Dudley brushed off these reports.Morrison, p. 158  Battle  The Wabanaki did the most damage to Spurwink and Purpooduck (Cape Elizabeth). In Spurwink, principally inhabited by the Messrs. Jordans and their families, the Wabanaki killed or captured 22. At Purpooduck, where there were nine families settled at Spring Point, they killed 25 and carried away eight prisoners.Williamson, p. 23 The garrison of 36 men at Casco (Falmouth) was commanded by Major John March. The fort was the \\"most considerable\\" fort on the eastern coast. On August 10, 1703, under the leadership of Moxus, Wanongonet and Escumbuit, the Wabanaki appeared unarmed and sent him a message under a flag of truce; pretending they had some important matter to communicate. Apprehending no immediate danger, he proceeded with a guard of only two or three men. The Wabanaki ambushed March and shot one of his attendants. A garrison of 10 men under Sargeant Hook rescued March and the others. The Wabanaki killed two of March's companions, Phippenny and Kent, in the altercation. The Wabanaki withdrew and skulked around the peninsula for a week, setting fire to the houses. The rest of the Wabanaki battalions, arrived at Casco in 200 canoes to continue the destruction of the village. They first took a sloop, two shallops and considerable plunder ; and encouraged by success, they attempted for two days and nights, to undermine the fort from the water side, as was done during King William's War. On 19 August Captain Cyprian Southack arrived on the Province Galley and relieved the siege.Williamson, p. 44 The natives continued to stroll around Casco, they boarded a store ship and killed the captain and three others, while wounding two others.Williamson, p. 45 On 26 September, Governor Dudley ordered 360 men to march toward Pigwacket, one of the main native villages, located at present-day Fryeburg, Maine. Leading 300 New Englanders, Major March chased the Wabanaki back to Pigwacket. March killed 6 and captured 6. These were the first New England reprisals of the war. Aftermath In the spring of 1704, after the Raid on Deerfield in February, the Wabanaki again attacked Wells, and York. (In 1712, the Wabanaki conducted another campaign against these villages and towns. They killed or captured twenty-four people in three raids on three villages, one of the villages was Wells.)Williamson, p. 55 In response to these events and the Raid on Deerfield, the governors of the northern English colonies called for action against the French colonies. Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley wrote that \\"the destruction of Quebeck and Port Royal [would] put all the Navall stores into Her Majesty's hands, and forever make an end of an Indian War\\",Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 191 the frontier between Deerfield and Wells was fortified by upwards of 2,000 men,Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 190 and the bounty for Indian scalps was more than doubled, from ¬£40 to ¬£100.Melvoin, p. 229 Dudley promptly organized a retaliatory raid against Acadia. In the summer of 1704, New Englanders under the leadership of Benjamin Church raided Acadian villages at Pentagouet (present-day Castine, Maine), Passamaquoddy Bay (present-day St. Stephen, New Brunswick), Grand Pr√©, Pisiquid, and Beaubassin (all in present- day Nova Scotia).Clark, p. 220 There were also reprisals by the New Englanders against Norridgewock. During the winter of 1705, 275 soldiers under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton were sent to Norridgewock to seize Father Rale and sack the village. Father Rale escaped them, but they burned his church. John March led an expedition against the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707. The French drew off a great number of Indian families from the Penobscot, Norridgewock, Saco, and Pequaket tribes, and settled them at St. Francis, in Canada, as a protection against the Iroquois Confederacy. These were called the St. Francis Indians.Willis, p. 311 Notes Category:Conflicts in 1703 Category:1703 in North America Category:Military history of Acadia Category:Battles in Maine ","title":"Battle of Falmouth (1703)"},{"id":"43041308","text":"Mount Moriac is a rural locality in the Surf Coast Shire, Victoria, Australia. In the 2016 census, Mount Moriac had a population of 240 people. A farming community developed at Mount Moriac as early as the 1840s, with a hotel opening in 1844. A Catholic school was opened by 1853, and a Catholic church (St Patrick's) built in 1863. It became the administrative centre of the district, with a police station, court, and the offices of the Barrabool Hills Road Board. By 1865, it also had a flour mill, several shops, the offices for the Shire of Barrabool, a hotel, and Presbyterian and Bible Christian churches. Mount Moriac State School opened in 1875. The railway line was extended from Geelong to Colac in 1877, and a station was opened at nearby Moriac. A new township developed around the railway station, and over time took prominence over the older Mount Moriac settlement. The shire offices shifted to Geelong in 1949, and ceased holding meetings in the shire hall at Mount Moriac in 1976. Mount Moriac Primary School was merged into nearby Moriac Primary School in the 1990s.

Clifford A separate hamlet named Clifford, located within the modern Mount Moriac locality, developed around the intersection of Cape Otway and Devon Roads and the Princes Highway in the early 1850s, and had a hotel (Gorell's Clifford Hotel), school, church, store and blacksmith. This area took its name from Clifford Farm, the property of Lawrence Trewin. The school, run by the Church of England, opened as Colac Road on 15 August 1853, was renamed Duneed in 1856, and renamed Clifford in 1871. The school closed on 18 August 1875, and the church closed in the same year. A fire on 27 May 1877 destroyed the hotel, store and post office.

It extended west from Red Cliffs railway station on the Mildura railway line into the wheat farming areas established as soldier settlements after World War I. The line opened initially to Werrimull in 1924 and was later extended to Meringur in October 1925 then Morkalla in 1931. As the towns along the line shrank with reduced populations due to increased farm size and mechanisation, the line became less used and was eventually closed completely in 1988. There were several proposals to extend the line across the border into South Australia to connect with the Mallee railways either on the line to Renmark near Paringa or to extend the Peebinga railway line, however none of these proposals eventuated to extend the line beyond Morkalla. There was support from South Australians in the Riverland region to gain this connection for trade, however it appears not to have been supported by the state government of the day. Route The line began at Red Cliffs, south of Mildura. It ran roughly west, 10‚Äì12 km south of what is now the Sturt Highway.

The style draws from traditional motifs such as Beaux-Arts classicism and Art Deco and is similar to Streamline Moderne,McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Architecture and Construction often with zigzag ornamentation added. The structures reflect a greater use of conservative and classical elements and have a monumental feel. They include post offices, train stations, public schools, libraries, civic centers, courthouses, museums, bridges, and dams across the country.

It is inspired from a true story in 1998 from a blog titled, \\"Agia to Oxford\\" by Manjit Nath. The film takes the viewer back to the Indian state of Assam in 1998. It is basically a memoir of a person who had been on the verge of abandoning education and taking up arms against the state, but who was then counseled by his father, which set him on the right and, hence, a better direction. The pivotal character of Tultul‚Äôs father in the film has been played by the eminent actor, Adil Hussain. Written and directed by Prathamesh Krisang. Starring Adil Hussain as 'Deuta', which means 'father, the 30 minute film revolves around a 15-year-old boy named Tultul and his three friends. They are inspired to join an extremist group which has been fighting to gain independence for Assam from the Republic of India.

It also portrays how parents can guide their children by informing them of a better way to bring about changes. The film was premiered on in multiple national and international film festivals. Numerous scenes have been shot at exotic locations around Assam. It took one and a half year for the filmmaker to get the film ready, and this includes getting it crowd funded in the middle of the production .

From winning the Golden Palm Award at 10th Mexico International Film Festival 2015, the film has been honored time and again in film festivals. Plot The film revolves around a 15-year-old boy named Tultul and his three friends, who are inspired to join a militant outfit after having been incited with patriotic sentiments by a rebel leader. The trio of Tultul‚Äôs friends try to absorb Tultul into their hatched plan of sneaking out of their homes to join the rebel forces, lest they are hindered by their parents. Tultul finds it difficult to make up his mind. Tultul's father happens to discover the revolutionary poems composed by him and realizes the need of a guiding light for Tultul. He guides Tultul out of the dilemma of joining rebellion by informing him that books, and not guns, are the real agents of change. Tultul abides by the advice of his father, gets educated from one of the top universities of the world and moves ahead to be a real harbinger of change, while his friends perish into the inferno of militancy. The plot is based on the true life-story of a young man from Assam, named Manjit Nath, who had been on the verge of turning into a militant. While touching the underlying issues of armed rebellions, teen militants and importance of education as an agent of change, the attempts to drive home the point that ‚Äì there is a better way than militancy in which one can help one's community prosper.

Name The range is named after John McDouall Stuart, the first European explorer to pass through the area, in 1858. Formation During the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary, central Australia experienced crustal compression resulting in very broad, low-amplitude folding, and the Stuart Range formed on a basement upwarp.Krieg, G.W., Alexander, E.M. & Rogers, P.A.: Jurassic-Cretaceous epicratonic basins. In: Drexel & Preiss (1995) pp. 101-112. Underlying the Stuart Range, the folded sediments include the Early Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian) Bulldog Shale, consisting of grey marine mudstones. Where the Bulldog Shale has been exposed at the surface for long periods it has been subjected to deep chemical weathering, resulting in bleaching and the \\"multi-hued, picturesque colouration\\" found in the Arckaringa-Stuart Range landscape.Krieg, G.W. & Rogers, P.A.: Stratigraphy - marine succession. In: Drexel & Preiss (1995) pp. 112-123. The prolonged chemical weathering also dissolved silica which, transported through the regolith by the movement of groundwater, precipitated as the ambient conditions changed, forming silcrete (a type of duricrust), with the silica forming a secondary cement binding the sediment grains into sheets of hard, indurated rock, generally parallel to the land surface. This occurred at deeper levels, at the intersection with the groundwater table (forming groundwater silcrete), or close to the surface, within the soil profile (forming pedogenic silcrete). Groundwater silcretes typically formed in more localised, topographically lower settings such as valley bottoms and slopes, whereas pedogenic silcrete tended to form extensive sheets over very large areas. Over long periods of time, as the landscape was lowered further by weathering and erosion, the silcrete became exposed at the surface as a lag gravel, an armoured carapace of gibbers (also known as a desert pavement), protecting the weaker regolith below from mechanical erosion. The resulting landscapes are relatively flat, undulating plains with low relief.Benbow, M.C., Callen, R.A., Bourman, R.P. & Alley, N.F.: Deep weathering, ferricrete and silcrete. In: Drexel & Preiss (1995) pp. 201-207. Throughout the Tertiary the Stuart Range has been an important palaeodrainage divide, between the Eucla and Lake Eyre basins.Callan, R.A., Sheard, M.J., Benbow, M.C. & Belperio, A.P.: Alluvial fans and piedmont slope deposits. In: Drexel & Preiss (1995) pp. 242-3. In places where fluvial erosion has been more active, gullies have dissected the palaeosurface of the upland, forming a characteristic tableland topography where a continuing process of scarp retreat leaves behind mesas and buttes, which persist until their residual silcrete capping is finally lost.

It also aims to raise public awareness about the plight of the sun bears and to raise conservation awareness about this species. The BSBCC was established as a non-profit organisation in Sabah in 2008. It is a joint project between sun bear researcher Wong Siew Te, Land Empowerment Animals People (LEAP), the Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD) and the Sabah Forestry Department (SFD). The BSBCC is neighboured to the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre in Sepilok and shares veterinary facilities, personnel, parking, access roads and ticket gates.BSBCC Website: Location ; accessed 12 June 2014 History Seeing sun bears kept in dreadful conditions during his study drove the wildlife biologist Wong Siew Te on a quest to open a facility to improve their welfare. The search for a suitable place unlocked a 2.5 ha site within the 42 km2 Sepilok-Kabili Forest Reserve. The area is adjacent to the Sepilok Orang Utan Rehabilitation Centre and once housed a Sumatran rhinoceros captive breeding programme which stopped in 2006 after the death of the last male rhino there.The Star Online: At home in the forest, 5 May 2014; accessed 12 June 2014 The BSBCC started in 2008 with taking over the responsibility of seven captive bears under the care of Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre.MESYM: Wong Siew Te, on Conserving Sun Bears in Borneo; accessed 12 June 2014 In March 2010, the first phase of the structural development of the centre culminated in the opening of a new 20-bear house and outdoor enclosures in the Sepilok Forest Reserve. In April 2010, the existing captive bears were moved into their new living spaces, integrated into 'bear groups' and given access to outdoor enclosures during the day.BSBCC: Structural Development ; accessed 12 June 2014 A second phase of the project started in September 2010 with the goal to convert the old bear house into offices, a visitor centre and gift shop. It also included the establishment of a quarantine area for up to 10 bears, as well as construction of a new viewing platform and refurbishment of existing boardwalks and trails on the site. By June 2014, the number of sun bears in the centre has increased to 33.BSBCC: Home; accessed 12 June 2014 Future developments will involve construction of a second bear house and forested enclosures with capacity for 20 additional bears. Mission The mission of BSBCC is neither to be a zoo or merely a tourist attraction, but a centre to improve animal welfare, and for education, research and rehabilitation. To follow up this objective, it was necessary to create the capacity to confiscate, rehabilitate and release suitable orphaned and ex-captive bears back into the wild. For captive bears, which cannot be released, it was desirable however, to provide an improved long-term living environment.BSBCC: Our mission ; accessed 12 June 2014 At the same time, the centre aims to be a strong base to educate the public about the plight of the sun bears, to raise conservation awareness about this species, and to conduct more research on this species.Sorenson, J.: Interview with Siew Te Wong. The Brock Review. 12(1): 182-186., 2011 Through ongoing research, increased knowledge and awareness, and further protection of habitat, the centre wants to achieve increased protection for sun bears and their habitat.

Background As with a scientific experiment, in Testing repeatability and control of variables is essential. In testing a key component of this control is to manage the environment in which testing is taking place. This environment specifically includes the underlying hardware and software which supports the actual software under test. This encompasses items such as servers, operating systems, communications tools, databases, cloud ecosystems, browsers. In early testing stages only limited formal management of environments is required, if any. For example programmers may typically perform their testing within standardised IDEs which provide control by default. However at later stages, test execution will tend to work across multiple technologies and development streams, and typically involving multiple (teams of) testers. In these circumstances individual testers cannot reasonably be expected to exercise control over the technical landscape. This is where the need for some formal Test Environment Management function arises. Activities  The activities under the TEM function include: * Maintaining a central repository of test-environments in scope with their latest version and connectivity details (Information management) * Allocation of test environments (booking/scheduling) to teams as per requirement. (Demand management) * Creation of new test environments as per requirement. (Supply management) *Environment Monitoring (Monitoring) * Deleting/ updating outdated test-environments and its details (Housekeeping) * Preliminary investigation of issues on the environment and sometimes co-ordination till an issue resolution (Incident Management) * Analyzing data for environment issues, identifying trends and taking pro-active steps to resolve issues / co- coordinating for a long term fix. (Problem Management) *Test Data Management to ensure that test data is available to testers when needed via a TDM tool or test data refresh from other environments *Status Accounting to report on service, usage, and availability metrics to provide full transparency into test environment management activities *Continuous Improvement to continuously evaluate test environment management services for improvement opportunities (people, process, and tools) *Automation to eliminate manual tasks as much as possible to improve efficiency Tools # Configuration Management Database software : This tool would be required to maintain a repository of the environment components and its versions. The data in this tool would also be helpful in incident management and problem management. # Booking tool : This tool would be required to capture the allocation of test environments and to check for the availability of the environments. Usage analysis can also be captured in it. # Problem / Incident management tools : This tool would be used to capture the problem / incident data and to manage the life-cycle of the incident / problem. Reports generated based on this data would give good insights into the health of the test environments. #Test Data Management tool: This tool allows testers to create, recycle, mask, and use their test data on demand. Many teams use spreadsheets instead of using specific tools for the first two areas if the data is less. However, if the data is more, it is recommended to use specialized tools for it.

It is international in scope, but predominantly Australian, as a large proportion of the volunteers are Australian. Most of the surveys are done by volunteer recreational divers, collecting biodiversity data for marine conservation. The database is available to marine ecology researchers, and is used by several marine protected area managements in Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa and the eastern Pacific. Function Reef Life Survey provides data to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources. They collect and curate biodiversity information at spatial and temporal scales beyond those possible by most scientific dive teams which have to work with limited resources, by using volunteer recreational divers trained in the RLS survey procedures. The University of Tasmania houses and manages the RLS database, and the data is freely available to the public for non- profit purposes through public outputs, including their website. History Reef Life Survey was started by researchers at the University of Tasmania and initially funded by the Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities (CERF) Program. This program is the core activity of the Reef Life Survey Foundation Incorporated ‚Äì a not for profit Australian organisation. Personnel Reef Life Survey includes a volunteer network of recreational scuba divers, trained in the relevant skills, and an Advisory Committee. The advisory committee is made up of managers and scientists who use the collected data, and representatives of the recreational diver network. Procedures Diver swimming a transect for Reef Life Survey Standard survey procedures are used matched to a variety of habitat topographies, and using simple equipment - waterproof clipboard with records sheet, underwater camera, and 50m surveyor's tape measure. The surveys are typically repeated at irregular intervals at listed sites, identified by GPS location, transect depth and direction, and are usually conducted as a pair of transects in opposite directions from the nominal position, at approximately constant depth. Data collected includes fish counts by visual census in a 5m x 5m corridor on both sides of the transect line (Method 1), mobile invertebrate counts in a 1m corridor on both sides of the line (Method 2), and photo-quadrats at 2.5m intervals along the 50m transect line. Manufactured debris may also be recorded. Off transect observations of interest are recorded separately (Method 0). Numbers and size class are recorded for fish, just numbers for most invertebrates. Data Since 2006, divers have collected data for RLS from over 44 countries. As of September 2015, more than 4500 species have been recorded from over 7000 surveys.

The series ran in his comic books Dork and House of Fun before it received a two-issue run through Dark Horse Comics in 2014. Eltingville was adapted into a pilot for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block in 2002, but was not picked up for an official series. The series has won three Eisner Awards, beginning with the 1995 story Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett. Of the series' title, Dorkin chose to name the series Eltingville after Eltingville, Staten Island, where he worked off and on in a comic book store for six years. Synopsis The Eltingville comics surround a group of four teen boys (Bill, Pete, Josh, and Jerry) in Eltingville, Staten Island that are interested in various different elements of geek culture, with each character showing a specific interest in one area. Dorkin has described the characters as \\"four older teenagers who are fans, and they‚Äôre possibly some of the worst fans who have ever lived.\\" The series places the characters in various scenarios that Dorkin utilizes to parody common stereotypes and situations that he or others have come across in comic book and geek fandom. Characters *William \\"Bill\\" Dickey: Bill is the de facto leader of the quartet and is shown to have a heavy interest in comic books and sci-fi shows and movies. He has an extremely overbearing personality and is greatly disliked by his peers, including the other members of the Eltingville Club. In This Fan, This Monster he is hired to work at the local comic book store Joe's Fantasy World and quickly allows the power to go to his head, resulting in the store's destruction. He is of average build and wears glasses. In the comic series, it has been mentioned that he has a younger brother, but in the pilot his brother is replaced with a younger sister, Jane. Bill has been frequently implied to be the most sadistic and sociopathic of the four, as he attempted to murder his whole club and Joe by setting fire to his store in a fit of insanity. During the final issue of the comics, Bill is shown to have unsuccessfully transitioned into adulthood as he is still living at home, is still a virgin, has had at least one failed business, and is more unpleasant than he was before, as his bitterness towards life and women has further warped his personality. *Joshua \\"Josh\\" Levy: Josh is an overweight Jewish teen with glasses and dark hair who is heavily interested in sci-fi films, books, and television shows, especially anything Star Wars related. He is one of Bill's primary antagonists in the series and the two often get into fights, either verbal or physical, which ends in either Pete, Jerry, or both of them to break it up. Dorkin has stated that Josh is a composite of two different people that he knows. It is implied that he has a somewhat weak mother, as she takes strong medications and gets heart attacks. As an adult Josh is depicted as working for a comic book news website, with the hopes that it will serve as a stepping stone to becoming a comic book writer, despite his fiction writing getting repeatedly rejected by publishers and his former college professor. *Peter \\"Pete\\" DiNunzio: Pete is primarily interested in horror. He is somewhat based upon a friend of Dorkin's as well as a \\"certain kind of Staten Island resident\\". Pete has dark hair, is shorter than his counterparts, and is of otherwise average build. It has been mentioned in the comics that Pete has a younger sister and several older brothers. In the final issue, Pete is a mostly bald adult that has found employment as a member of a film crew that specializes in creating horror porn, a position that he frequently uses to exploit desperate female performers. *Jerry Stokes Jr.: Jerry is more quiet than his counterparts and is interested in fantasy role playing games and gaming in general. His meek demeanor causes his fellow club members to view him with some disgust, as evidenced in This Fan, This Monster where Pete uses gaming terms to insult him and Bill later rants that Jerry has never really made any of his \\"saving throws\\". Jerry is based upon several different people. Jerry is of average weight and height and has blond hair. He has a habit of imitating Twiki and appears to be of a pacifistic nature. Jerry's real name has been said to be Jerome, but in This Fan, This Monster, his real name is Gerald. At the end of the series, Jerry is shown to be the most successful of the former club, as he has found employment as a professional Magic: The Gathering player, has a much higher sense of self- esteem, and is dating a beautiful, popular female pop and geek culture correspondent. *Joe Gargagliano: Joe is an overweight, slovenly adult male and the owner of Joe's Fantasy World. He is shown to have little to no morals when it comes to selling items and frequently mistreats his customers. He also has a book containing nicknames for different customers, including the Eltingville Club. At the end of This Fan, This Monster, Joe's comic book store is destroyed in a fire. Awards * Eisner Award for Best Short Story for Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett (1996, won) * Eisner Award for Best Short Story for The Marathon Men (1998, won) * Eisner Award for Best Short Story for The Intervention (2002, won) Publishing history The first Eltingville story was an untitled strip that ran in the first issue of Instant Piano in 1994. Dorkin initially intended for the strip to be a one-shot, but chose to continue writing Eltingville-themed stories due to reader response and his own enjoyment of the comic. Following stories were published through various different publications such as Dork, House of Fun, and Dark Horse Presents. Eltingville was published in the United Kingdom in Deadline as well as in Spain, where strips ran in the Spanish language magazine El Vibora and a collection of the strips were published in 2007 as El Club Eltingville De Comics, Ciencia-Ficcion, Fantasia, Terror y Juegos de Rol. # Untitled first strip (Instant Piano #1, Dark Horse Comics, 1994 - Reprinted in Dork #6) # Bring Me The Head of Boba Fett (Instant Piano #3, Dark Horse Comics, 1995 - Reprinted in Dork #6) # Bread and Suck-Asses (Dork #3, SLG Publishing, 1995) # The Marathon Men (Dork #4, SLG Publishing, 1997) # Captain's Log, Stardate 5/5/98 (Dork #6, SLG Publishing, 1998) # Unstable Molecules (Wizard #99, 1999 - Reprinted in Dork #8, 2000) # The Intervention (Dork #9, SLG Publishing, 2001) # As Seen On TV (Dork #10, SLG Publishing, 2002) # They're Dead, They're All Messed Up (Dark Horse Presents Volume 2, #12, 2012 - Reprinted in House of Fun #1, Dark Horse Comics, 2013) # This Fan, This Monster (Dark Horse Comics, 2014 - also known as The Eltingville Club #1) # Lo, There Shall Be an Epilogue (Dark Horse Comics, 2015 - also known as The Eltingville Club #2) * The Northwest Comix Collective (Dork #6, SLG Publishing, 1998 - considered to be an alternative comics version of the Eltingville Club) =Collections= * El Club Eltingville De Comics, Ciencia-Ficcion, Fantasia, Terror y Juegos de Rol (LA Cupula Ediciones, 2007) * The Eltingville Club (Dark Horse Comics, 2016) Development Dorkin came up with the idea for Eltingville after witnessing comic book publisher and author Dan Vado receive abuse while he was working with DC Comics. Vado killed off the popular character Ice while writing \\"Justice League America\\", which caused various fans to send him death threats and hate mail. He published the first strip in Instant Piano in 1994 and ended up writing follow-up stories in the Eltingville world over a period of 20 years. The Eltingville characters are an exaggerated portrayal of several people that Dorkin knows and also draws on Dorkin's own likes and experiences as a fan, retailer, and professional. They are meant to portray the fanbase that does not \\"change or evolve\\" to embrace changes in geek culture such as the \\"increasing acceptance and swell of fandom\\", as they see their fandom as making up their entire identity and being. Dorkin has received both praise and backlash from readers over his description of comic book readers and the geek fandom. Of Eltingville's humor, he has stated that \\"The humor is supposed to hit close to home, Eltingville's a joke but it's supposed to be an uncomfortable one, it's not about cuddly, cute, awkward fans, it's always been about the unsocial, self-absorbed, arrogant little tyrants that make fandom a less fun place, the idiots who make death threats to creators and rape threats against women writing about sexism in the video game industry, who flip out about the casting of an actor playing a fictional character, who argue the most ridiculous points of trivia as if they honestly matter in the scheme of things, who put fantasy above reality and don't know how to behave like credible human beings and go bonkers if they're called on that behavior. Most fans aren't like that, but in all aspects of life the trolls are the loudest and the proudest and they really junk the joint up.\\" Welcome to Eltingville In October 2001, Dorkin work completed on an animated adaptation of the Eltingville stories, entitled Welcome to Eltingville. The pilot episode aired in 2002 as part of Cartoon Network's late night programming block Adult Swim and adapted the story Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett. Critical response for the pilot episode was positive, but the pilot was not picked up for a full series. Dorkin has stated that if he could have done the pilot over again, that he would have delegated more work and that he would have chosen a different story to animate for the episode, as it would have shown a wider perspective for the series and characters.

It is located at the City Plaza near Calamba Church and Rizal Shrine. Built in 1937, it is constructed to illustrate and immortalize the folk tale on how the city got its name with the names of the city's barangays inscribed on its surface. The giant claypot can also be found in the city's official seal.  Etymology  The large claypot in the city plaza named CALAMBANGA is derived from the two words kalan and banga from which the city allegedly obtained its name. According to legend of early settlers, two guardia civil or Spanish soldiers approached a young woman who was carrying a jar of water and a stove. One of the Spanish soldier asked the woman for the name of the town. Since the woman cannot understand Spanish, she thought that the soldiers were asking her what she was carrying. She utterly answered, \\"kalan-banga\\" which means clay stove and clay pot., The Spaniards who was unable to pronounce Tagalog correctly, assumed that the place is named Kalambanga. Later on, Kalambanga was shortened to Calamba.  History  A Calamba Claypot Jar in Poblacion V The plaza was proposed by the then town councilor Dr. Agapito Alzona, to utilize the area where the old town market once stood. The resolution was approved by the then town mayor Roman Lazaro. The giant claypot was built in 1937 and completed in 1939.

From there Protestantism spread to East Prussia, Greater Poland, Lesser Poland and other Polish provinces, as well as Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1573 the Protestants, commanding a majority in the Sejm (parliament), scored a major political victory by passing a law of religious tolerance, the Warsaw Confederation. Towards the end of the 16th century, it can be estimated (through the number of parishes) that about a seventh of the Christian population in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were Protestant. In the 16th century, Poland was a haven for many refugees fleeing persecution from less tolerant parts of Europe, harboring not only Catholics and Protestants, but also people of Orthodox, Judaic and even Muslim faiths. Soon after the words of Reformation reached Poland in the first half of the 16th century, Catholic authorities such as primate of Poland Jan ≈Åaski and bishop and vice-chancellor Piotr Tomicki began issuing edicts condemning this movement, and garnered royal support for this course of action. In the second half of the century, key Polish counter-reformation figures included cardinal Stanislaus Hosius. bishop and royal secretary Martin Kromer, primate Stanis≈Çaw Karnkowski and Jesuits Piotr Skarga and Jakub Wujek. Key dates and events marking the beginning of counter-reformation in Poland were the establishment of the regular papal nunciature mission in 1555 (beginning with the arrival of Luigi Lippomano), arrival of the Jesuit order in 1564, and the synod of Piotrk√≥w's acceptance of the Decrees of Trent in 1577. At first the agents of counter- reformation in Poland focused on persuasion, through they also relied heavily on legal discrimination, particularly the anti-Reformation royal decrees of Sigismund I of Poland. The Catholic Church in Poland succeeded in subordinating the Eastern Orthodox Church through the Union of Brest-Litovsk (1595‚Äì1596). Jesuit schools gained significant renown at that time. From the 17th century, agents of counter-reformation became increasingly intolerant, succeeding in introducing censorship, including the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Some Protestant denominations were banned, while others lost many churches and adherents. Construction of non-Catholic churches was banned in 1632. The pacifist Polish Unitarians (Polish Brethren) were expelled from Poland in 1658 for refusing to aid the country in the time of military need. In 1668 the Sejm made it illegal for Catholics to convert to another faith; in 1673 non-Catholics were forbidden to be ennobled. By the first half of the 18th century, Protestants were barred from most civil offices, including being elected to the Sejm. Nonetheless, compared to many other European countries, the conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants was relatively peaceful. Non-Catholics were rarely sentenced to death for their beliefs; the most common punishments were fines or exile. Polish historian Janusz Tazbir coined a phrase \\"state without stakes\\", illustrating that the level of religious persecution and conflict in Poland was much lower than in most other European countries of that time, a fact that can be attributed to Protestant success in passing laws providing for religious toleration in the 16th century, and later, to the weakness of the Polish central state, which the resurgent Catholics were unable to use to implement more violent methods of conversion or reconversion (such as burning at the stake). Many Protestant nobles converted back to Catholicism to increase their chances of receiving favorable positions from Catholic-leaning monarchs; others did so to prove that they were \\"patriots\\". Many scholars agree that \\"Poland was one of the great successes of the Counter-Reformation\\" and cite Counter-Reformation in Poland as the main instance where the Roman Catholic Church successfully reversed gains of the Reformation. Others, however, such as Norman Davies, suggest that the triumph of the Counter-Reformation might have been exaggerated, and that at the very least not all Protestants were reconverted, nor was this the case with other denominations such as Eastern Orthodox. Counter-reformation ended with the Repnin Sejm of 1768, which abolished legal discrimination against religious dissidents. Following further reforms at the Partition Sejm in 1773, the political rights of the remaining non-Catholics in the Commonwealth were largely restored, half a century or so before similar concessions were granted to Catholics in Protestant countries like Britain (1829) or Sweden (1849). Reasons for success Success of the counter- reformation in Poland can be attributed to the vigorous activities of the Jesuits and other monastical orders, and to the fact that the Polish kings of that period were primarily Catholic, and leaned towards either neutrality or clear support for the counter-reformation policies. Protestantism, too often treated instrumentally by the elites, also failed to find significant followings among the masses of Polish peasantry. Lutheranism remained closely associated with German-speaking burghers, and the mid-17th century wars with Protestant Sweden also contributed to the rejection of Protestant identity by the Polish nobility, as many Protestants allied themselves with the invading Swedes, leading in the aftermath to all Protestants being seen as traitors. Finally, the Protestant sects were numerous and disorganized, lacking internal unity, whereas the Catholic response was much better organized. Significance Catholicism was able to become a part of Polish identity and Polish nationalism. It marked Poland as Antemurale Christianitatis, a country defending the borders of Catholic faith, thus clearly separating Poland from its mostly Protestant, Orthodox and Muslim neighbors, It became one of the defining characteristics of the szlachta's (Polish nobility's) Golden Freedoms, and conversion to Catholicism was one of the elements of polonization of the Ruthenian nobility. Critics of the Counter-Reformation argue that it had contributed to the Commonwealth's decline, by reducing its cultural pluralism, tolerance, and receptiveness to foreign ideas, and by bringing about a stagnation in the intellectual life.

The building is of great historical and architectural significance and is famous for having Johannesburg's first ever lift. History The building was originally built and named Permanent Building by the South African Permanent Mutual and Investment Society which were founded in Kimberley in November 1883, the objective being to assist people of small means to acquire their own property, and to provide facilities for the deposit of savings where they could earn interest. The first branch opened in Johannesburg in 1889 and moved into the new five storey building, now called Victory House, in 1897. Design Victory House is the earliest example of Stucke's work. It is described as a bold, proud and handsome classical building. In Victory House Stucke combined and adapted various elements of different styles so skilfully that they can hardly be recognised, and thus formed a new composition in the so-called Creative Eclectic Style ‚Äì an expression of the Victorian desire for a new style to meet the challenges of a new era. The building has many typical features of a Colonial Victorian building including corrugated iron roofing, decorative wrought iron ornamentation and red brickwork. Whilst the brickwork has been painted over, the outline is still visible. Construction Victory House in 1897 while still under construction Victory House in 1898 right after the installation of its famous lift Built just before the South African War, Victory House is the epitome of a Late Victorian commercial structure. It was the most prestigious building in Johannesburg and was the first to have a lift which had crowds gaping for weeks. The lift was a technological marvel, complete with a safety apparatus; it also boasted a polished oak cage and an upholstered seat. The lift was supplied by R Waygood of England. An early letter to the lift firm references the employment of a caretaker and the purchase of a bag of coal to operate the boiler which worked the hydraulic lift. The total cost of the original lift, boiler and engine was 1020 pounds. The staircase was made of cast iron, also made in England it was the first fireproof staircase in Johannesburg. In an interesting anecdote historian Eric Rosenthal, whose father had his offices at Permanent Buildings, has written of his father's encounter with Gandhi on the day the caretaker-cum-operator refused to convey Gandhi in the lift. Gandhi would not demean himself as to walk when the European was carried in the lift.

Assisted by passenger Bernard Schnieders he became world champion in 1984, 1985 and 1986. In the next five years, he was still in the final ranking in the top three. The sidecar class was at that time still a part of the world championship grand prix and there was a lot of competition. Streuers' main rivals were Rolf Biland, Steve Webster and Alain Michel. A total of 22 Grand Prix victories were achieved by Streuer, 15 with Bernard Schnieders. Although Streuer and Schnieders had already celebrated triumphs in almost all circuits but would initially fail in their own hometown, to win. A victory at the Dutch TT was at one time more important than anywhere else in the world. In 1987, they finally went first across the finish line in their home GP. Streuer repeated this feat in 1991. The first sidecar passenger of Streuer was Johan van der Kaap who participated between 1978 and 1980 in the Grands Prix. After van der Kaap quit for personal reasons in 1981, Bernard Schnieders took his place. Schnieders stopped after the end of 1988 his place was taken by Geral de Haas which yielded two World Championship runner up places in 1989 and 1990. In 1991 and 1992 the Englishman Peter Brown took place in the chair but further successes were not to be. Streuer not only known as a fast and safe driver, but also as a gifted technician.

It denotes a particular type of novel of the 19th and early 20th century primarily aiming at adolescent girls as an audience. In the 19th century the now antiquated Backfisch was a common term to describe girls between the ages 13 and 16 or more general during puberty. The exact origin of the term is not known. Most likely it was taken from the identical word used by fishermen to describe small young fish in a catch, which were of less use. For the origin of this use two different explanations are offered in literature. One states that it is derived from the English word back, because those fish were often thrown back into the water. The other resorts to an alternative literal meaning as baked fish and states that traditionally in cooking such small fish were only prepared by baking since they were considered not large enough for boiled or fried dishes. Hermann Schrader: Der Bilderschmuck der deutschen Sprache in Tausenden volkst√ºmlicher Redensarten.

Heyne, 2011, p. 14 (German) The Backfischroman is usually told from a first person perspective with the main character being an adolescent girl of middle or higher class upbringing. She tends to be an open and friendly person, who pursues her own interests independently of society's norms and later after a learning process makes her own free decision to accept the role for a woman as wife and mother. Typical well known examples are Emmy von Rhoden's Der Trotzkopf (1885) and Clementine Helm's Backfischchens Leiden und Freuden (1863). Later examples like Else Ury's Nesth√§ckchen allow a bit more room and different topics for the female protagonist being not quite as restrictive as before. This is due to changing attitudes from the Wilhelmine period (1871-1918) to the Weimar period (1918-1933). The terms Backfischroman and Backfischliteratur are not applied to girl literature from the middle of the 20th century onwards, which features a vastly expanded range of topics and has turned away from traditional roles for women.M√§dchenliteratur.

He spent his early career in Paris, and his later career in Saint-Maurice- Navacelles. Biography Dard√© was born in Olmet near Lod√®ve in H√©rault. His primary schooling was at the Fr√®res des √âcoles Chr√©tiennes in Lod√®ve until the age of 13. He then attended a seminary, considering an ecclesiastical vocation, but left after only two months. His artistic talents soon showed themselves and he chose sculpture as his preferred medium. He was taken under the wing of Max Theron, the engraver and professor of design at the Lyc√©e in Lod√®ve, who tutored him in design and engraving. After military service at Montpellier, he attended evening classes at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts where he won several prizes and a grant to cover a trip to Italy. He spent time in Venice, Bologne, Florence and Rome. He lived a frugal life in order to prolong his stay. He returned to the Beaux-Arts de Paris and studied under Injalbert and Rodin who took him into his studio although he only stayed there for three days! One of his early works, \\"L'√©ternelle douleur\\" was executed in 1913 and can be seen today in the Mus√©e d'Orsay. He was called into service (as a stretcher-bearer) in the 1914-1918 war and was wounded. His brother was killed in that war. He subsequently returned to Montpellier where he completed a sculpture of \\"Jeanne d'Arc\\" and several compositions for tombs in the cemetery at St Lazare. He then began working on a series of war memorials. In 1920, he was awarded the Grand Prix National des Arts and his composition entitled \\"Faune\\" was put into the Mus√©e Rodin, and then in the park of the Ch√¢teau de Vizille. In 1925 he exhibited at the Salon des Arts D√©coratifs. In 1930 he completed a bust of Macbeth and a statue of a prehistoric man which was placed at the entry to the Mus√©e des Eyzies. In 1931 his statue of Ren√© Quinton was inaugurated at Chaumes in Brie. At the 1931 Salon he showed the works \\"Thais aux Enfers\\" and \\"Christ aux outrages\\". Despite these successes he had many problems and in 1935 left Paris leaving a trail of debts and as a consequence of his financial woes his works were seized and his studio put up for sale, which reportedly led him to develop a persecution mania. He set himself up in Saint-Maurice-Navacelles and worked on drawings with various themes; a Chanson de Roland, la Croisade des Albigeois, Dante, Macbeth, Hamlet, the Bible, Attila, les hommes pr√©historiques et moyen√¢geux, les Mongols, Tolsto√Ø and Beethoven. Age and bad health forced him eventually to return to Lod√®ve and he died in relative poverty there on 29 December 1963. He is buried in Olmet.

Dard√©'s composition comprises a group of five women and two children and the body of a dead soldier. Four of the women stand at the rear whilst a fifth, possibly the widow or mother of the dead soldier, lies at his side. The children hold laurel leaves. The work stands in a public park, once the garden of the bishops of Lod√®ve and near the old episcopal palace and the cathedral. Dard√© dresses four of the women in clothes worn in the different seasons-spring, summer, autumn and winter. He tries to show the different social classes who all suffered losses in that most terrible war; all sectors of society were to lose loved-ones. Two children are added to symbolize \\"innocence\\".

It is reached by 11 steps of grey granite. They are arranged in two flights with the width slowly decreasing. The rear and sides of the mausoleum have false arched windows but at the front is an opening covered by an ornamental iron grille. Beyond this grille is a niche into which Dard√©'s composition has been placed. This comprises the body of a dead soldier who is watched over, not by an angel or a grieving wife or mother but by a nude woman who has been likened by some to a circus or cabaret performer. The sculpture was completed between 1924 and 1925 and the memorial was completed in 1931. It has always courted controversy. Perhaps the nature of the woman is some form of protest by Dard√©.

He also served on the city council for a fourth term from 1999 to 2001. Robertson first ran for mayor in 2011, but was defeated by incumbent Mayor Tony Chavonne, who won re-election to a fourth term. In April 2013, incumbent Fayetteville Mayor Tony Chavonne announced that he would not seek re-election after four consecutive terms in office. Robertson soon announced his candidacy to succeed Chavonne. He narrowly defeated his opponent, city councilwoman and real estate agent Val Applewhite, in the mayoral election on November 5, 2013. Robertson received over 50% of the vote, while Applewhite placed a close second with over 49%. Voter turnout was more than 20%, which was considered high for an off-year Fayetteville municipal election. Robertson was sworn into office on December 2, 2013, for a two-year term as mayor. Governor of North Carolina, Pat McCrory, appointed Robertson to the Governor's Crime Commission during the Spring of 2014. He began work on the Commission during its June 2014 quarterly meeting.

She cofounded the Ilanga lase Natal newspaper, Ohlange Institute and Natal Native Congress (the precursor to the South African Native National Congress) while she was married to John Langalibalele Dube. They both travelled to the United States, where Nokutela was described as a \\"woman of note\\". She died while estranged from her husband, who was then President of what would become the African National Congress. The school she co-founded was the place that Nelson Mandela chose as the location for his first ever vote in an election. In 2017, Nokutela Dube was posthumously awarded South Africa's highest honour ‚Äî the Order of the Golden Baobab ‚Äî 100 years after her death. Life Nokutela Mdima was born in 1873 to Christian converts at a missionary station at Inanda, near Durban. From 1881 she was taught by Ida Wilcox, who was part of a husband and wife team running the mission. Nokutela was a star pupil and an essay she wrote was published in Ida's home town in Minnesota as part of a regular report she made to the press. Nokutela's essay was used to show how the mission was inspiring children to learn English.Stephen Coan, \\"It's Nokutela's Turn\\", The Witness, 2 November 2011, retrieved 15 June 2014. After leaving Inanda Seminary School Mdima worked as a teacher, and married John Dube in 1894 in Inanda. John was the son of James Dube who was a minister at Inanda. The couple left South Africa in April 1896 and travelled to Britain, sailing for New York from Southampton in May 1896. By November their story was being reported by the New York Tribune. Her husband was not the only black South African to visit New York, but Nokutela was unusual because she was female. The Los Angeles Times included Nokutela in their feature series \\"Women of note\\" on 13 February 1898. The newspapers introduced them as Mr and Mrs John Lindley Dube, and described their pleasing appearance, her ankle- length dress and her husband's double-breasted suit. (This adopted name was the same as that of the missionaries, Daniel and Lucy Lindley, who had established the Inanda mission.) The change in presentation was presumably made to assist American readers who might find John's middle name difficult to pronounce. The papers reported that Nokutela would take a home-making course while her husband would train to join the clergy. Their stated objective was to be more \\"effective missionaries to the heathen\\". While the Dubes were in the US they were inspired by the educator Booker T. Washington, but their main training came from the Union Missionary Training Institute where 30 to 45 Christian missionaries from Europe, Asia, Australia, Arabia, and in this case, Africa studied. This Brooklyn establishment was able to exist because pastors and professors would volunteer their time. While she was in America the Woman's Board of Missions published her story, Africa ‚Äì The Story of My Life, in 1898. Ohlange Ohlange school in 1907 After returning to South Africa and teaching at Dube's old school at Inanda they set up Ohlange High School. This was the first in the country to be established by black teachers. It was her husband who was offered the opportunity to use a farm that his cousin had bought, but it was Nokutela's links back to Mary Edwards, who led her old school, that helped the couple establish the farm that became the seminary. Nokutela Dube taught music, cooking, housekeeping and tailoring, and also sang and played traditional instruments on fundraising tours. With her husband, she co-wrote Amagama Abantu (A Zulu Song Book), published in 1911. This book is regarded as a milestone in the creation of a new type of Zulu choral music. The Dubes described these secular songs as the first to combine Zulu and European traditions for the \\"Black Community\\". The first printing of this book records both John and Nokutela as joint authors in a plural form of isiZulu. John only once steps out of this form of address in the introduction to point out that the music is Nokutela's responsibility. Nokutela had musical abilities but she had also taken singing lessons from two teachers while in America. Nokutela described this as \\"better singing\\". In addition to his literary works, the Dubes founded the first Zulu/English newspaper Ilanga laseNatali (The Sun of Natal) in 1903. The Dubes are credited with making the song \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\" popular. It became part of the South African national anthem after Ohlange Institute's choir used it. The choir played it at the South African Native National Congress meeting in 1912. It was sung after the closing prayer, and in 1925 would be adopted as the official closing anthem of the African National Congress.Enoch Mankayti Sontonga, SAHistory.org.za, accessed 23 June 2014. Nokutela and John Dube's failure to have children was seen to reflect badly on Nokutela and John fathered a child with one of their pupils. Nokutela in her own childhood had written of the importance and expectation that her people put on having children. A committee was set up to investigate her husband, but they took no action and Nokutela felt humiliated. The couple separated in about 1914, and Nokutela moved to the Transvaal, where she preached in rural communities before becoming ill with kidney disease. She returned to live with her husband in Johannesburg, and died in 1917 at the age of 44. Her funeral was attended by Pixley ka Isaka Seme and other prominent members of what was to become the African National Congress (ANC).Nokutela Dube, Johannesburg City Parks, retrieved 8 April 2015. She was buried in an unmarked grave with a reference number starting \\"CK\\", which stood for \\"Christian Kaffir\\". Legacy It is said that Dube inspired Lillian Tshabalala and others to found the club movement called \\"The Daughters of Africa\\", in Natal in 1932, modelled on the African-American women‚Äôs club movement.Healy-Clancy, Meghan, \\"The Daughters of Africa and Transatlantic Racial Kinship: C. L. Tshabalala and the Women's Club Movement, 1912-1943\\", Amerikastudien/American Studies 59, no. 4 (2014): 481‚Äì499. The school that she co-founded with her husband was chosen by Nelson Mandela as the place where he wanted to cast his first vote in the first democratic elections in South Africa. However, Nokutela's contribution to South African education and the growth of what was to become the African National Congress was not well known. More recent research has identified that her failure to have children with John Dube contributed to not only the breakup of their marriage but it also meant her story was only known via stepchildren, nieces and nephews. In 2012, Professor Ch√©rif Keita of Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, made a film about Nokutela Dube, Ukukhumbula uNokutela ‚Äì Remembering Nokutela, and campaigned to raise awareness of her work.Antoinette Muller, \\"Remembering Nokutela Dube, a pioneer forgotten\\", The South African, 8 August 2015.\\"Her contributions to South Africa were unknown, but a new film aims to change that\\", PRI's The World, 8 May 2014.

Much controversy has surrounded these claims. It is most widely held today that the Wright Brothers were the first to fly successfully. Brazil regards Alberto Santos-Dumont as the first successful aviator because the Wright Flyer took off from a rail and, after 1903, used a catapult. An editorial in Jane's All the World's Aircraft's 2013 edition supported the claim of Gustave Whitehead. Significant claims Several aviators or their supporters have laid claim to the first manned flight in a powered aeroplane. Claims that have received significant attention include: * Cl√©ment Ader in the Avion III (1897) * Gustave Whitehead in his No's. 21 and 22 aeroplanes (1901‚Äì1903) * Richard Pearse in his monoplane (1903‚Äì1904) * Samuel Pierpont Langley's Aerodrome A (1903) * Karl Jatho in Jatho biplane (1903) * The Wright brothers in the Wright Flyer (1903) * Alberto Santos-Dumont in the 14 Bis (1906) In judging these claims, the generally accepted requirements are for sustained powered and controlled flight. In 1890 Ader had made a brief uncontrolled and unsustained \\"hop\\" in his √âole, but such a hop is not regarded as true flight by some. The ability to take off unaided is also sometimes regarded as necessary. The air historian Charles Gibbs-Smith has said that, \\"The criteria of powered flight must remain to some extent a matter of opinion.\\"Gibbs-Smith (1959) History =Antecedents= The du Temple monoplane Some notable powered hops were made before the problem of powered flight was finally solved. In 1874 F√©lix du Temple built a steam-powered aeroplane which took off from a ramp with a sailor on board and remained airborne for a short distance. This has sometimes been claimed as the first powered flight in history but the claim is generally rejected because takeoff was gravity-assisted and flight was not sustained. It is however credited as the first powered take-off in history.Wragg (1974)Angelucci & Marticardi (1977), Pages 16, 21. Ten years later in 1884 the Russian Alexander Mozhaysky achieved similar success, launching his craft from a ramp and remaining airborne for 30 m (98 ft). The claim that this was a sustained flight has not been taken seriously outside Russia. Cl√©ment Ader's √âole of 1890 was a bat-winged tractor monoplane which achieved a brief, uncontrolled hop, becoming the first heavier-than-air machine in history to take off from level ground under its own power. However his hop is not regarded as true flight because it was neither sustained nor controlled. Ader would later make a controversial claim of a more extended flight. In 1896, Samuel Pierpont Langley, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, had successful flights with several unpiloted models, and his Number 6 model flew more than . From these successes, in 1898 Langley received grants from the War Department for $50,000 and an additional $20,000 from the Smithsonian, to attempt development of a piloted version. The 1901 Drachenflieger of Wilhelm Kress did not even achieve a hop. A floatplane, it is notable as the first heavier-than-air craft to be powered by an internal combustion engine rather than steam. It demonstrated good control when taxiing, but was too underpowered to take off. =The period of claimed flights= A replica of the Ezekiel Airship, which is claimed to have flown in Pittsburg, Texas in 1902, although there is no physical evidence to support such a claim. Few of the claims to powered flight were widely accepted, or even made, at the time the events took place. Both the Wrights and Whitehead suffered in their early years from a lack of general recognition, while neither Ader nor Langley made any claim in the years immediately following their work. The pioneer Octave Chanute promoted the Wrights' work, some of which he witnessed, in America and Europe. The brothers began to gain recognition in Britain, where Colonel John Edward Capper was taking charge of Army aeronautical work. On a visit to the U.S. in 1904 Capper befriended the Wrights and subsequently helped foster their early recognition. He also visited Langley, who openly discussed his failure with Capper.Walker (1974) The perspective changed in 1906. Early in the year Langley died, without ever making any claim. The U.S. Army rejected a proposal from the Wrights on the basis that their machine's ability to fly had not been demonstrated. Thus, when Alberto Santos-Dumont made a brief flight that year in his 14-Bis aeroplane, there was no acknowledged antecedent and he was acclaimed in France and elsewhere as the first to fly. Ader responded by claiming that he had flown in his Avion III back in 1897. =Claims and recognition= Santos- Dumont's 1906 claim to flight has never been seriously disputed, although few authorities credit his as the first, while some have questioned the effectiveness of his controls. In 1908 the Wrights embarked on a series of demonstrations with their by now much improved Flyers, Orville in America and Wilbur in Europe. The European demonstrations drew instant recognition of their technical achievements, although both the use of a launch trolley and lack of aerodynamic stability meant that acceptance of the first flight claim was not universal. Ader's claim was debunked in 1910, when the official report on his work was finally published. In America the Smithsonian Institution began to promulgate a claim for Langley, who had been its Secretary from 1887 until his death. In 1914 they loaned the Aerodrome to Glenn Curtiss who modified it heavily until it became capable of brief flights. They used this as the basis for a claim that the Aerodrome was the first aeroplane \\"capable of flight\\". Orville, the surviving Wright brother, began a long and bitter public relations battle to force it to recognize their claim to primacy, his disgust reaching such a peak that in 1928 he sent the historic Flyer for display in the British Science Museum in London. He eventually succeeded in his battle when the Smithsonian admitted to Curtiss' modifications and withdrew its claim in 1942.Crouch, T.; The Bishop's Boys: A Life of Wilbur and Orville Wright, Norton 2003. Meanwhile, with the publication of a co-authored article and a book by the journalist Stella Randolph, Whitehead had also begun to gain vocal advocates. In 1945 Orville Wright issued a critique of the evidence for Whitehead. Orville died on January 30, 1948. As part of the Smithsonian's final deal with his executors, the Flyer was returned to its native America and put on display. A clause in the contract required the Smithsonian to claim primacy for the Wrights, on pain of losing the prize exhibit. Whitehead's advocates have fought an equally bitter battle with the Smithsonian in an attempt to gain recognition, in which the Smithsonian's contract with the Wright estate has been subject to heavy criticism. Although Whitehead's advocates have gained some following, they remain in the minority. It is most widely held today that the Wright Brothers were the first to make controlled sustained heavier-than-air flights. Brazil still officially regards Santos-Dumont as the first successful aviator because his craft did not use an external launch system. Ader The Avion III Following his hop in the √âole, Cl√©ment Ader obtained funding from the French Ministry for War. He completed the similar but larger Avion III in 1897. In trials it failed to leave the ground at all, and remains notable only for its twin steam engines. Several years later in 1906, following Bl√©riot's first successful flights Ader claimed publicly that his √âole had flown for 330 ft (100 m) in 1891, and that the Avion III had flown for 1,000 ft on the second day of its trials. Ader's claim for the Avion III was refuted four years later in 1910, when the French Ministry for War finally published its report on his work. His claim for the √âole also collapsed through lack of credibility. Whitehead The illustration that accompanied the claim in the Bridgeport Herald When Gustav Weisskopf immigrated to the United States he changed his name to Gustave Whitehead. There he began an extensive series of experiments with gliders, aero engines and motorized flying machines. Whitehead and other sources have claimed he made successful powered airplane flights. *Louis Darvarich, a friend of Whitehead, said they flew together in a steam-powered machine in 1899 and crashed into the side of a building in their path.Weissenborn, G.K.; \\"Did Whitehead fly?\\", Air Enthusiast 35, Pilot Press (1988), Pages 19-21 and 74-75. *The Bridgeport Herald newspaper reported that on August 14, 1901 Whitehead flew his \\"No.21\\" monoplane to a height of and could steer it a little by shifting his weight to the left or right. *Whitehead wrote letters to a magazine, saying that in 1902 he made two flights in his No.22 machine, including a circle, steering with a combination of the rudder and variable speeds of the two propellers. =Controversy ignites= Stanley Beach was a friend of Whitehead, sharing a patent application with him in 1905. Beach's father was editor of Scientific American, which was initially sympathetic to Whitehead and included a number of reports of short flights by Whitehead.Sci. American, September 19, 1903, p. 204Sci. American, January 27, 1906\\"Santos Dumont's Latest Flight\\", Sci Am, November 24, 1906, p. 378\\"The Second Annual Exhibition of the Aero Club of America\\", Sci. Am, December 15, 1906, p. 448-449Sci. American, January 25, 1908 Later, Beach and Whitehead fell out and, now editor of the Scientific American in his turn, Beach denied that Whitehead ever flew. Whitehead's claims were not taken seriously until two journalists, Stella Randolph and Harvey Phillips, wrote an article in a 1935 edition of Popular Aviation journal. Harvard University economics professor John B. Crane responded with a rebuttal, published in National Aeronautic Magazine in December 1936. The next year Randolph expanded the article, together with additional research, into a book titled Lost flights of Gustave Whitehead. Crane changed his mind in 1938 and suggested that a Congressional investigation should consider the claims. By 1945 Orville Wright was sufficiently concerned about the Whitehead claims that he issued his own rebuttal in US Air Services. Then in 1949 Crane published a new article in Air Affairs magazine that supported Whitehead.Brown, J.; \\"Affidavit of Junius Harworth III (Gyula Horvath)\\", Gustave Whitehead - Pioneer Aviator, www.gustave-whitehead.com (retrieved 9 October 2014)Crane, J.; \\"Early Airplane Flights Before the Wrights,\\" Air Affairs, Vol. 2, Winter, 1949. =History by contract= Following a chance discovery in 1963, reserve U.S. Air Force major William O'Dwyer was asked to research into Whitehead. He became convinced that Whitehead did fly and contributed research material to a second book by Stella Randolph, The Story of Gustave Whitehead, Before the Wrights Flew, published in 1966. O'Dwyer and Randolph co-authored another book, History by Contract, published in 1978. The book criticised the Smithsonian Institution for its contracted obligation to credit only the 1903 Wright Flyer for the first powered controlled flight, claiming that it created a conflict of interest and had been kept secret. The Smithsonian defended itself vigorously. =Jane's renews controversy= On 8 March 2013 the aviation annual Jane's All the World's Aircraft published an editorial by Paul Jackson endorsing the Whitehead claim.Jane's all the world's aircraft, 2013 edition, editorial. (with highlighting, retrieved 1 October 2014) Jackson's editorial drew heavily upon information provided by aviation researcher John Brown, whom he complimented for his work. Brown had begun researching Whitehead's aircraft while working as a contractor for the Smithsonian. Jane's corporate owner later distanced itself from the editorial, stating it contained the views of the editor, not the publisher.\\"Jane's backs off Gustave Whitehead claim,\\" 17 April 2015, NAHA News, National Aviation Heritage AllianceGray, Caroll F., Jane's Points Finger at Editor Huffington Post. Retrieved 14 February 2016 Brown analysed in great detail a vintage photograph of an early indoor aeronautical exhibition, claiming that an even earlier photograph visible on the wall showed the Whitehead No. 21 aircraft in powered flight.Brown, J.; \\"Detailed Photo Analysis\\", Gustave Whitehead - Pioneer Aviator, (www.gustave- whitehead.com/) Jackson's editorial did not mention the claim, and two weeks after its publication he stated to the press that the image was not significant to the claim of Whitehead's flight, remarking, \\"And that entirely spurious 'Where's the photograph?' argument.\\".Paul Jackson explains his reasoning, gustave-whitehead.com Aviation historian Carroll Gray subsequently identified the photo seen on the wall \\"beyond any reasonable doubt\\" as a glider built and displayed in California by aviation pioneer John J. Montgomery.Carroll F. Gray (Ed.); \\"Update # 5: The Photographs - Whitehead Aloft They Are Not\\" Flying Machines (flyingmachines.org) Responding to the renewed controversy, Tom Crouch, a senior curator at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, formally acknowledged the Wright contract, saying that it had never been a secret.Crouch, T.; The Wright-Smithsonian Contract , Smithsonian Institution, 2013. He also stated; Scientific American published a rebuttal of the Whitehead claims written by its senior copy editor Daniel C. Schlenoff, who asserted, regarding the Bridgeport Herald report, that \\"The consensus on the article is that it was an interesting work of fiction.\\" Schlenoff, Daniel C., Scientific American, June 13, 2013, \\"Connecticut Proclaims Gustave Whitehead Flew before the Wright Brothers\\" Retrieved June 27, 2013. Thirty-eight air historians and journalists also responded to the revived controversy with a \\"Statement Regarding The Gustave Whitehead Claims of Flight,\\" rejecting the evidence supporting the claims and noting that, \\"When it comes to the case of Gustave Whitehead, the decision must remain, not proven.\\"Gustave Whitehead, flyingmachines.org Langley Langley's first failure Samuel Pierpont Langley was Secretary to the Smithsonian Institution from 1887 until the year of his death in 1906. During this period, and in due course supported by the United States War Department, he conducted aeronautical experiments, culminating in his manned Aerodrome A. Under Langley's instruction Charles M. Manly attempted to fly the craft from a catapult on the roof of a houseboat in 1903. Two attempts, on 7 October and 8 December, both failed with Manly receiving a soaking each time. =Glenn Curtiss and the Smithsonian= Some ten years later in 1914 Glenn Curtiss modified the Aerodrome and flew it a few hundred feet, as part of his attempt to fight a patent owned by the Wright brothers, and as an effort by the Smithsonian to rescue Langley's aeronautical reputation. The Curtiss flights emboldened the Smithsonian to display the Aerodrome in its museum as \\"the first man-carrying aeroplane in the history of the world capable of sustained free flight\\". Fred Howard, extensively documenting the controversy, wrote: \\"It was a lie pure and simple, but it bore the imprimatur of the venerable Smithsonian and over the years would find its way into magazines, history books, and encyclopedias, much to the annoyance of those familiar with the facts.\\"Howard, F.; Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers, Dover 1987. The Smithsonian's action triggered a decades-long feud with the surviving Wright brother, Orville. It was not until 1942 that the Smithsonian finally relented, publishing the Aerodrome modifications made by Curtiss and recanting misleading statements it had made about the 1914 tests.Honious, Ann. 2003, \\"What Dreams We Have, Appendix C ‚Äì Tests of the Langley Aerodrome.\\" nps.gov. Retrieved: September 21, 2010. Wrights In the air on 17 December 1903 On 17 December 1903 a few miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina the Wright brothers launched their airplane from a dolly running along a short rail, which was laid on level ground. Taking turns, Orville and Wilbur made four brief flights at an altitude of about ten feet each time. The flight paths were all essentially straight; turns were not attempted. Each flight ended in a bumpy and unintended \\"landing\\" on the undercarriage skids, or runners as the craft did not have wheels. The last flight, by Wilbur, was 852 feet (260 m) in 59 seconds, much longer than each of the three previous flights of 120, 175 and 200 feet. The Flyer moved forward under its own engine power and was not assisted by catapult, a device the brothers did use during flight tests in the next two years and at public demonstrations in the U.S. and Europe in 1908-1909. A headwind averaging about 20 mph gave the machine sufficient airspeed to become airborne; its speed over the ground was less than 10 mph. Photographs were taken of the machine in flight. The Wrights kept detailed logs and diaries about their work.Dayton Metro Library Their correspondence with Octave Chanute provides a virtual history of their efforts to invent a flying machine. They also documented their work in photographs, although they did not make public any photos of their powered flights until 1908. Their written records also were not made available to the public at the time, though they were published in 1953 after the Wright estate donated them to the U.S. Library of Congress. The Wrights' claim to a historic first flight was largely accepted by U.S. newspapers but inaccurately reported initially. In January 1904 they issued a statement to newspapers accurately describing the flights. After an announced public demonstration in May 1904 in Dayton, the Wrights made no further effort to publicize their work, and were advised by their patent attorney to keep details of their machine confidential. In 1905 a few dozen people witnessed flights by the Wright Flyer III. Pioneers such as Octave Chanute and the British Army officer Lt. Col. John Capper were among those who believed the Wrights' public and private statements about their flights. In 1906, almost three years after the first flights, the U.S. Army rejected an approach from the Wrights on the basis that their proposed machine's ability to fly had not been demonstrated. By 1907 the Wrights' claims were accepted widely enough for them to be in negotiations with Britain, France and Germany as well as their own government, and early in 1908 they concluded contracts with both the US War Department and a French syndicate. In May Wilbur sailed for Europe in order to carry out acceptance trials for the French contract. On 4 July 1908 Glenn Curtiss gave the first widely publicised public demonstration of flight in the USA. As a result, the Wright brothers' prestige fell. Subsequent flights of both brothers that year went on to astonish the world and their early claims gained almost universal public recognition as legitimate. Subsequent criticisms of the Wrights have included accusations of secrecy before coming to Europe in 1908, the use of a catapult-assisted launch and such a lack of aerodynamic stability as to make the machine almost unflyable. =The Smithsonian feud= Following the Curtiss experiments with the Langley Aerodrome in 1914, surviving Wright brother Orville began a long and bitter campaign against the Smithsonian to gain recognition. His disgust reached such a peak in 1928 that he sent the historic Flyer for display in the British Science Museum in London. It was not until 1942 that the Smithsonian finally relented, at last retracting its claims for Langley and acknowledging the Wrights' place in history. Orville died on January 30, 1948. The Flyer - delayed by the war and an arrangement for a copy to be made - was returned to its native America and put on display in the Smithsonian. A clause in the contract required the Smithsonian to claim primacy for the Wrights, at risk of losing their newly acquired prize exhibit. The Smithsonian has honoured its contract ever since and continues to support the Wrights' claim. Santos-Dumont The 14-Bis seen from the front, before it was fitted with ailerons Alberto Santos-Dumont was a Brazilian aviation pioneer of French ancestry. Having emigrated to France for studies, he made his aeronautical name in that country with airships before turning to heavier- than-air flight. On 23 October 1906 he flew his 14-bis biplane for a distance of 60 metres (197 ft) at a height of about five meters or less (15 ft). The flight was officially observed and verified by the A√©ro-Club (later renamed the A√©ro-Club de France). This won Santos-Dumont the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the first officially-observed flight of more than 25 meters. This flight is also recognised as the first powered flight in Europe. Then on 12 November a flight of 22.2 seconds carried the 14-bis some 220 m (722 ft), earning the A√©ro-Club prize of 1,500 francs for the first flight of more than 100 m.Angelucci & Marticardi (1977) This flight was also observed by the newly formed F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) and became the first record in their log book. The lateral control system comprised ailerons mounted between the wings and attached to a harness worn by the pilot, who was intended to correct any rolling movement by leaning in the opposite direction. Both flights ended when the craft began to roll and Santos-Dumont landed because he was unable to correct it. This has led some critics to question the lateral control capability of the 14-bis, however it has not prevented the flight from being recognised.Who Was First?, wright-brothers.org (retrieved 6 October 2014): \\"Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont flew his 14-Bis near Paris, France in the fall of 1906. In October, his best flight covered 196 feet (60 meters); in November, he stretched that to 721 feet (220 meters). Both flights ended when his aircraft entered a roll that Santos-Dumont could not stop and he decided to land, so there is some controversy whether or not these were completely controlled flights. Nonetheless, they are counted as the first \\"official\\" flights in Europe.\\" At that time the Wrights' claim had not yet been accepted in Europe and was questioned in America by the authoritative Scientific American. Thus, Santos-Dumont was credited by many with the first powered flight. Other claims Richard William Pearse Monument Jatho biplane In 1894 Hiram Maxim tested a flying machine running on a track and held down by safety rails because it lacked adequate flight control. The machine lifted off the track and met the safety rails and this is sometimes claimed as a flight. Maxim himself never made such a claim. John Hall, of Springfield, Massachusetts was credited, alongside Whitehead, with flights prior to the Wrights by Crane in his 1947 Air Affairs magazine article. Preston A. Watson was subject of a claim made in 1953 by his brother J.Y. Watson, that he had flown before the Wrights in 1903. J.Y. Watson later admitted that this was in an unpowered glider. =Pearse= Richard Pearse of New Zealand is credited by some in his country with making the first powered airplane flight on 31 March 1903.\\"Richard Pearse First Flyer\\" NZEdge.com.

A \\"floating garden\\" of the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), a 2.3 kilometer long park along the left bank of Seine in the 7th arrondissement. Paris today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than three thousand hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden, created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace, and redone by Andr√© Le N√¥tre in 1664; and the Luxembourg Garden, belonging to a ch√¢teau built for Marie de' Medici in 1612, which today houses the French Senate. The Jardin des Plantes was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626 by Louis XIII's doctor Guy de La Brosse for the cultivation of medicinal plants. Between 1853 and 1870, the Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and the Parc des Buttes Chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the neighborhoods of the city. One hundred sixty-six new parks have been created since 1977, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987‚Äì1991) and Parc Andr√© Citro√´n (1992). Some of the most notable recent gardens of Paris are not city parks, but parks belonging to museums, including the gardens of the Rodin Museum and the Mus√©e du quai Branly. From Roman times through the Middle Ages The enclosed garden of the Palais de la Cit√© is visible in this illustration from the Tr√®s Riches Heures du duc de Berry (1410). The old garden is now the Place Dauphine. Gardens existed in Paris in Roman times and the Middle Ages, either to produce fruits, vegetables and medicinal herbs; for the meditation of monks; or for the pleasure of the nobility; but no trace remains of the original gardens of the Roman town of Lutetia. The royal palace on the √éle de la Cit√© had a walled garden located at the southern point of the palace, near where the statue of Henry IV on the Pont Neuf is today. The garden disappeared when the Place Dauphine was built in the early 17th century.Meunier, Florian, Le Paris du Moyen √Çge, pp. 37‚Äì38 The monasteries on the left bank had extensive gardens and orchards from the Middle Ages until the French Revolution. The Jardin des Plantes was built on land that originally belonged to the Abbey of Saint Victor. and a large part of the Luxembourg Garden today belonged to the neighboring Monastery of the Chartreux. A small modern recreation of a Medieval garden is found today next to the Cluny Museum, the former residence of Abbot of the Abbey of Cluny. Renaissance Gardens and Gardens a la Fran√ßaise (1564-1700) In 1495, King Charles VIII and his nobles imported the Renaissance garden style from Italy after their unsuccessful Italian War of 1494‚Äì1498. The new French Renaissance garden was characterized by symmetrical and geometric planting beds or parterres; plants in pots; paths of gravel and sand; terraces; stairways and ramps; moving water in the form of canals, cascades and monumental fountains, and extensive use of artificial grottoes, labyrinths and statues of mythological figures. They also featured a long axis perpendicular to the palace, with bodies of water and a view of the whole garden, They were designed to illustrate the Renaissance ideals of measure and proportion, and to remind viewers of the virtues of Ancient Rome. The French kings imported not only the ideas, but also Italian gardeners, landscape architects, and fountain-makers to create their gardens. The first examples in France were far from Paris, where there was more space for big gardens; the gardens of the royal Ch√¢teau d'Amboise (1496), the Ch√¢teau de Blois (c. 1500), Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau (1528), and the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau (1521), with additions by Catherine de' Medici in 1560. In the mid-17th century, under Louis XIV, the French formal garden, or Jardin √† la fran√ßaise, gradually replaced the Renaissance style garden; it was more formal and geometric, and symbolized the dominance of the King over nature. The most famous example was the gardens of Versailles, made by Andr√© Le N√¥tre beginning in 1661. Le N√¥tre remade the Tuileries Gardens in the new style beginning in 1664. =Jardins des Tuileries (1564)= Plan of the Tuileries garden from 1576 The Tuileries Gardens, created for Queen Catherine de' Medici in 1564 and remade by Andre le Notre for Louis XIV in 1664 The Jardin des Tuileries painted by Claude Monet (1876) The first royal garden of the Renaissance in Paris was the Jardin des Tuileries, created for Catherine de' Medici in 1564 to the west of her new Tuileries Palace. It was inspired by the gardens of her native Florence, particularly the Boboli Gardens, and made by a Florentine gardener, Bernard de Carnesecchi. The garden was laid out along the Seine, and divided into squares of fruit trees and vegetable gardens divided by perpendicular alleys and by boxwood hedges and rows of cypress trees. Like Boboli, it featured a grotto, with faience \\"monsters\\" designed by Bernard Palissy, whom Catherine had assigned to discover the secret of Chinese porcelain.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 46 Under Henry IV, the old garden was rebuilt, following a design of Claude Mollet, with the participation of Pierre Le N√¥tre, the father of the famous garden architect. A long terrace was built on the north side, looking down at the garden, and a circular basin was constructed, along with an octagonal basin on the central axis. In 1664 he garden was remade again by Andr√© Le N√¥tre in the style of the classic French formal garden, with parterres bordered with low shrubs and bodies of water organized along a wide central axis. He added the Grand Carr√© around the circular basin at the east end of the garden, and the horseshoe-shaped ramp at the west end, leading to a view of the entire garden. In 1667, Charles Perrault, the author of Sleeping Beauty and other famous fairy tales, proposed to Louis XIV that the garden be opened at times to public. His proposal was accepted, and the public (with the exception of soldiers in uniform, servants and beggars) were allowed on certain days to promenade in the park.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 47 =Cours-la-Reine (Cours- Albert-I) (1616)= The Cours-la-Reine (1616) The Cours-la-Reine (part of which today is named Cours-Albert-I after the King of Belgium during the First World War) was created by Marie de' Medici, who, like Catherine de' Medici, was nostalgic for her native Florence It was a long promenade (1.5 kilometers) along the Seine originally planted in with four long rows of elm trees. Built before the Champs Elysees, it was a popular promenade for the nobility, on foot or on horseback. =Place Royale (now Place des Vosges) (1605‚Äì1612)= Place Royale (renamed Place des Vosges in 1800) is a residential square and public park ordered by Henry IV and built between 1605 and 1612. In his ordinance, the King called for \\"a place to promenade for the residents of Paris who are closely pressed together in their houses.\\"Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens p. 56 The square was 108 meters long on each side, and lined with houses of the same height and in the same style. The center of the square was empty until 1639, when it was filled with an equestrian statue of Louis XIII. The square was divided in flower beds and lawns by diagonal alleys. The statue was destroyed during the French Revolution, then replaced with a new statue in 1822 during the Restoration. Four fountains were added in 1840. =Place Dauphine (1607) and Square du Vert-Galant (1884) = The Square du Vert-Galant at the √éle de la Cit√©, takes its name from Henry IV, famous for his romantic affairs. Place Dauphine was the second planned residential square, after the Place-Royale, built by order of Henry IV. It was located on the southern point of the √éle de la Cit√©, on the site of the garden of the old royal palace. It was named for the future King Louis XIII, and was built in the shape of triangle, with the point touching the Pont Neuf, which had been finished in 1606. A statue of Henry IV on horseback was placed on the bridge at the entrance to the square in 1614, at the suggestion of his widow, Marie de' Medici. The original statue was destroyed during the French Revolution, but was replaced by a new statue in 1821. The construction of the bridge joined two small islands to the √éle de la Cit√©; one of these islands had been the site where the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques DeMolay had been burned at the stake in 1314. The point of the island below the bridge and the statue of Henry IV was turned into a public park in 1884, dedicated to Vert-Galant, the \\"gallant green\\", the nickname of Henry IV, famous for his numerous romantic affairs. =Jardin des Plantes (1626)= the Jardin des Plantes in 1636, when it was the Jardin royal des herbs medicinales The Jardin des Plantes, originally called the Jardin royal des herbes m√©dicinales, was opened in 1626, under the supervision of Guy de La Brosse, the physician of King Louis XIII. Its original purpose was to provide medicinal plants for the court. It was built on land purchased from the neighboring Abbey of Saint Victor. A labyrinth and belvedere from 1840 can still be seen in the northwest section of the garden. In 1640, it became the first Paris garden to open to the public. In the eighteenth century, under the French natural scientist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who directed it from 1739 to 1788, the garden was doubled in size by an exchange of land with the Abbey, extending down to the banks of the Seine, and was greatly expanded with the addition of trees and plants brought by French explorers from around the world. One can see today a Robinia tree planted in 1636, and a sophora from 1747. In 1793, after the Revolution, the royal garden became the National Museum of Natural History, and a zoo was added. with animals brought from the Palace of Versailles. The garden was expanded again, and a school of botany founded. The first greenhouse was built in 1833 by Charles Rohault de Fleury, a pioneer in the use of iron in architecture. The first of the large greenhouses seen today was built by Jules Andr√© in 1879; the greenhouse of cactuses by Victor Blavette in 1910; and the tropical greenhouse, 55 meters long, by Ren√© Berger in 1937. The alpine garden was added in 1931, and the rose garden and the Jardin des vivaces were added in 1964.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 59‚Äì63. =Jardin du Luxembourg (1630)= The Luxembourg Garden in 1652 The Medici Fountain in the Luxembourg Garden The Jardin du Luxembourg was created by Marie de' Medici, the widow of Henry IV between 1612 and 1630. It was placed behind the Luxembourg Palace, an imitation of the Pitti Palace in her native Florence. She began by planting two thousand elm trees, and commissioned a Florentine gardener, Tommaso Francini, to build the terraces and parterres, and the circular basin the center. The Medici Fountain was probably also the work of Francini, though it is sometimes attributed to Salomon de Brosse, the architect of the palace. After Marie de' Medici's death, the garden was largely neglected. The last royal owner was the Count de Provence, the future King Louis XVIII, who sold the eastern part of the garden for building lots. After the French Revolution, the government of the French Directory nationalized the large p√©pini√©re, or nursery, of the neighboring monastery of Chartreux, and attached it to the garden. In 1862, during the Second Empire, Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann replanted and restored the gardens, but also took a portion of the nursery in order to make room for two new streets, Rue Auguste Comte and Place Andr√© Honnorat. The Medici fountain was moved back to make room for the Rue de Medicis, and the present long basin and the statuary were added to the fountain. During the reign of Louis-Philippe, who was fond of heroes of French history, the garden was decorated with the statues of the Queens of France and French women saints. During the French Third Republic, the government added the statues of writers, painters, composers, mythical figures, and a miniature of the Statue of Liberty by Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi. bringing the number of statues to more than seventy.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 65‚Äì70 =Jardin du Palais-Royal (1629) = Gardens of the Palais Royal in 1739 View of the Palais-Royal gardens in 1807, showing the circus, or riding hall. The garden of the Palais-Royal was built by Cardinal Richelieu, after he bought the h√¥tel d'Angennes in 1623 and turned it into his own residence, the Palais-Cardinal. When he died he left it to Louis XIV, who had played in the gardens as a child, and in 1643 it became the Palais-Royal. The garden, designed by Claude Desgots, featured two rows of elm trees, elaborate parterres and ornamental flower beds, statues, fountains and two basins, and a grove of trees at one end. It became the property of Monsieur, the brother of Louis XIV, in 1692, and thereafter belonged to members of Orleans branch of the dynasty. After the death of Louis XIV, it became the residence of the Regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, whose dissolute lifestyle provoked many scandals. The gardens became a popular meeting place for writers, and also a place frequented by prostitutes.Dictionnaire Historique de Paris, pp. 532‚Äì533. A fire destroyed much of the Palais in 1773, and the owner, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, decided to turn it into a profit-making establishment. He built an arcade of shops and caf√©s encircling the garden, with residences above, with a wooden gallery for promenading around the garden. A circus was established in the center for horseback riding. Since it was private property, he police were not permitted access. In the years before and after the Revolution, the garden and surrounding buildings became the meeting place for revolutionaries, for political debate, gambling and higher-class prostitution. The Theatre-Francaise, the future Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, was established there in 1787. During the Revolution, the garden and arcade was nationalized, and the heads of those guillotined were on several occasions carried on pikes by a crowd around the garden, in front of the diners in the cafes. The owner of the garden, though he supported the Revolution and changed his name to Philippe- Egalit√©, was guillotined in 1793. After the Restoration, the new Duke of Orleans, Louis-Philippe recovered his property, and returned it to respectability. He expelled the gambling salons and prostitutes, and had the garden and arcade rebuilt into roughly the way they look today. The Palais- Royale was burned by the Communards in May 1871, along with the Tuileries Palace and other symbols of royalty, and were rebuilt. During the 20th century, the residences overlooking the garden were the home of many French celebrities, including Andr√© Malraux, Jean Cocteau and Colette. and Two works of modern sculpture were added in 1986; an arrangement of columns, by Daniel Buren, and a fountain-sculpture of steel balls, by Pol Bury.Dictionnaire Historique de Paris, p. 534 English gardens and follies (1700‚Äì1800) Gardens of the √âlys√©e Palace, the residence of the President of France (1722) were the largest private gardens in Paris before the Revolution. Beginning in the mid-18th century, the French landscape garden began to replace the more formal and geometric jardin √† la fran√ßaise. The new style originated in England in the early 18th century as the English landscape garden or Anglo- Chinese garden. It was inspired by the idealized romantic landscapes and the paintings of Hubert Robert, Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, European ideas about Chinese gardens, and the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The earliest example of the style in France was the Moulin Joli (1754‚Äì1772), along the Seine between Colombes and Argenteuil. the most famous was the Hameau de la Reine of Marie Antoinette in the gardens of Versailles (1774‚Äì1779). In the late 18th century the Paris town houses of the French aristocracy, both on the right bank and left bank, usually had gardens in the English style. The largest private gardens in Paris were (and still are) those of the √âlys√©e Palace (1722), now the residence of the President of France. and of the H√¥tel Matignon (1725), the official residence of the Prime Minister of France (neither is open to the public). The folly was a specific kind of Paris park that appeared in the end of the eighteenth century. Privately owned but open to the public, they were designed for both amusement and instruction, filled with architectural models from different parts of the world and different centuries. Most of the early Paris follies had a short life and were divided into building lots: the most famous follies were the Follies of Bouexi√®re (1760), Boutin (1766), Beaujon (1773) and Folie Saint James (1777‚Äì1780). The one survivor, much transformed, is the Parc Monceau.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 74‚Äì75 =Parc Monceau (1778) = An illustration by Louis Carrogis Carmontelle of the follies he created for Parc Monceau. The Egyptian pyramid in Parc Monceau, the garden of \\"all times and places\\" (1778). Parc Monceau was established by Phillippe d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Chartres, a cousin of King Louis XVI, wealthy, and active in court politics and society. In 1769 he had begun purchasing the land where the park is located. In 1778, he decided to create a public park, and employed the writer and painter Louis Carrogis Carmontelle to design the gardens. In 1778, when the garden opened, Carmontelle was accused of imitating the English garden. In his book of images of the garden published in 1779, he responded: \\"It is not at all an English garden that we made at Monceau... we reunited in one single garden all times and all places. It is a simple fantasy, the desire to have an extraordinary garden, a pure amusement, and not a desire to imitate a nation, which, in making \\"natural\\" gardens, runs a roller over all the lawns and ruins nature.\\"cited in Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 75‚Äì76. The park contained dozens of fabriques, or constructions, including an Egyptian pyramid, antique sculptures, a Gothic ruin, a Tatar tent, a Dutch windmill, a minaret, a Roman temple, and an enchanted grotto,. Visitors to the garden were instructed to follow a certain path, from site to site. The experience was enhanced by park employees in exotic costumes, and camels and other rare animals.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 75‚Äì76. Beginning in 1781, most of the fabriques were removed, and Parc Monceau was remade into a more traditional English landscape garden. During the reign of Napoleon III, the park became the property of the city of Paris, and was made into a public park. Sections of the park were sold for the construction of large new townhouses to help finance the construction of the park. The park was surrounded by a monumental ornamental iron gate and fence and planted with a wide variety of exotic trees, shrubs and flowers. During the French Third Republic, the park was filled with statues of composers and writers. An arcade of the old H√¥tel de Ville, burned by the Paris Commune in 1871, was installed in the garden to provide a picturesque ruin. A few traces of the original folly, including the Egyptian pyramid, can still be seen.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 78‚Äì81. =Parc de Bagatelle (1778‚Äì1787)= Map of the garden by Thomas Blaikie Gardens and chateau of the Parc de Bagatelle (1778‚Äì87) The rose garden of Bagatelle The Parc de Bagatelle was created by the Count of Artois, the future King Charles X of France, on a section of the Bois de Boulogne that he had purchased in 1777. He made a wager with his sister-in-law, Marie Antoinette, that he could build a ch√¢teau where she could be entertained in less than three months. Construction of the little ch√¢teau began on 21 September and was finished on 26 November. The chateau was the work of the architect Fran√ßois-Joseph B√©langer, while the garden was made by the Scottish landscape designer Thomas Blaikie. The garden was built at the same time as the Parc Monceau, and, like that garden, it was filled with fabriques and follies, including a hill made of rocks crowned by a \\"Pavilion of Philosophers\\" that was half-Gothic and half-Chinese; an obelisk, a bridge surmounted by a pagoda, Gothic ruins, a tatar tent and a spiral labyrinth. All the follies gradually disappeared, and the park became a more traditional English garden. The pavilion on top of the pile of rocks was replaced by a more traditional structure. During the Second Empire, the Pavilion of Eug√©nie in the rose garden was added, in honor of the frequent visits to the garden of the Empress of Napoleon III.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 82‚Äì83. After the French Revolution, the garden was nationalized and made into a restaurant and a place for balls and festivals. After the restoration of the monarchy, it was returned to Count of Artois, whose family sold it in 1835 to Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, an English aristocrat who had settled in Paris. He and his heir, Sir Richard Wallace purchased additional land and enlarged the garden from 16 to 24 hectares and reconstructed it, adding new terraces, lawns, the picturesque pond with lily-pads, and many trees, including a giant sequoia, planted in 1845, that now is more than 45 meters high. In 1905 the heirs of Richard Wallace ceded the park to the City of Paris, which made extensive additions, including an enlarged rose garden, which became the site of the Concours international de roses nouvelles de Bagatelle, the international competition of new roses, in 1907. =Garden of the Rodin Museum (1755)= The gardens of the Mus√©e Rodin, a modern reinterpretation of an 18th-century formal residential garden Gardens of the Mus√©e Rodin (1755). The Mus√©e Rodin was originally constructed between 1728 and 1731 as a townhouse for Abraham Peyrenc, a wealthy Paris wig-maker. The second owner, the Duchess of Maine, created a long green for lawn-bowling, two covered alleys, and a grove of trees to the left of the entrance. The house and garden were purchased 1755 by Louis Antoine de Gontaut, the Duke of Biron and a Marechal of the royal army. He enlarged the garden to the south. Following the design of architect Pierre- Fran√ßois Aubert and gardener Dominique Moisy, the garden became a model of a classic French formal garden; The lawn was divided by a long north‚Äìsouth perspective and made into four sections of flowerbeds around an eighteen-meter basin. The east side of the garden was filled with trees, and they added an orangerie, a Dutch tulip garden, and a vegetable garden at the end. The Duke frequently held elaborate festivities and garden parties there, and often opened the garden to the public. The Duke died in 1788, on the eve of the Revolution. After the Revolution the house and garden became the property of the Papal legate, then of the Russian Ambassador, and then, in 1820, of a religious order, the Dames du Sacr√©-Coeur-du-J√©sus, and served as a boarding school until 1904. During that time the basin was filled in, garden largely let to grow wild, an orchard of fruit trees was added. The Dames also built a neo-gothic chapel in 1875, which, after the order was dissolved in 1904, became a residence where writers and artists could rent space. The sculptor Auguste Rodin became one of the tenants in 1908. The house and garden were purchased by the French State in 1911. Part of the garden was taken to build the neighboring Lyc√©e Victor Duruy, but Rodin remained as tenant and placed works of his sculpture along the main path. After his death in 1917, it became a museum devoted to his work, which opened in 1919.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 87‚Äì91 The basin was restored in 1927, but otherwise the garden remained much as it had been under the religious order. Beginning in 1993, the garden was redesigned by landscape designer Jacques Sgard both as an open-air gallery to display the works of Rodin, but also to recapture the appearance of an 18th-century formal French residential garden.Racine, Michel, Guide des jardins en France, p. 173 Parks and gardens of Napoleon III (1852‚Äì1870) Music in the Tuilieries Gardens, by Edouard Manet (1862). Sunday promenade in the Bois de Boulogne, by Henri Evenepoel (1890s) Napoleon III became the first elected President of France by an overwhelming vote in 1848. When he could not run for re-election, he organized a coup d'√©tat in December 1851 and had himself declared Emperor of the French in December 1852. One of his first priorities as Emperor was to build new parks and gardens for Paris, particularly in the neighborhoods far from the center, where the few public parks of the city were all located. Napoleon III named Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann his new prefect of the Seine in 1853, and commissioned him to build his new parks. Haussmann assembled a remarkable team: Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, the city's first Director of the new Service of Promenades and Plantations; Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, the city's first gardener-in-chief; Eug√®ne Belgrand, a hydraulic engineer who rebuilt the city's sewers and water supply, and provided the water needed for the parks; and Gabriel Davioud, the city's chief architect, who designed chalets, temples, grottos, follies, fences, gates, lodges, lampposts and other park architecture.De Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann, pp. 21‚Äì29. Over the course of seventeen years, Napoleon III, Haussmann and Alphand created 1,835 hectares of new parks and gardens, and planted more than six hundred thousand trees, the greatest expansion of Paris green space before or since. They built four major parks in the north, south, east and west of the city, replanted and renovated the historic parks, and added dozens of small squares and gardens, so that no one lived more than ten minutes from a park or square. In addition, they planted tens of thousands of trees along the new boulevards that Haussmann created, reaching out from the center to the outer neighborhoods. The parks of Paris, particularly the Tuileries gardens and the new Bois de Boulogne, provided entertainment and relaxation for all classes of Parisians during the Second Empire. =The Bois de Boulogne (1852‚Äì1858)= The artificial grand cascade and grotto of the Bois de Boulogne The kiosk of the Emperor, on the island in the lower lake in the Bois de Boulogne, is the only monument in Paris named for Napoleon III. The Bois de Boulogne was a scrubby forest to the west of the city, where the German, Russian and British occupation armies had camped after Napoleon's defeat and had cut down most of the older trees. In 1852 Napoleon III had land transferred from the list of Imperial property to the city of Paris, and bought the plots of private land within the park. He had lived long years in exile in London, and had frequently visited London's Hyde Park, with its serpentine lake and winding paths. It became the model for his first major new park. Thousands of workers began digging artificial lakes and brought boulders from the Forest of Fontainebleau to build an artificial cascade. Belgrand, the hydraulic engineer, built a special conduit from the Ourq canal, dug artesian wells, and laid 66 kilometers of pipes to provide water for the future lakes, lawns and flowerbeds. Alphand laid out 95 kilometers of new roads, riding trails and paths winding through the park. The gardeners seeded 273 hectares of lawn and planted 420,000 trees.De Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins d'Haussmann, pp. 57‚Äì60 The park was also intended to provide recreation for the Parisians; besides the roads for carriages and paths for horses and walking, Davioud built twenty-four chalets and pavilions around the park, which served as restaurants, cafes, theaters, and places of entertainment. Twenty hectares were set aside for a garden and zoo, the Jardin d'Acclimatation. In 1857 one corner of the park became the site of the Hippodrome de Longchamp, the city's most important horse racing track. During the winter, the lake became a popular destination for ice-skating. From its opening, the park was full of Parisians of all classes.De Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins d'Haussmann, pp. 60‚Äì65 =The Bois de Vincennes (1860‚Äì1865)= The Temple of Love on Lac Daumesnil in the Bois de Vincennes (1865) Fountains in the Bois de Vincennes during the 1931 Colonial Exposition The Bois de Vincennes was originally a royal hunting preserve and the site of an important royal residence, the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes, still existing. After Louis XIV moved the royal residence to Versailles, the chateau was neglected. Under Louis XV, the chateau was redesigned, and walking paths were created in the forest. During the French Revolution, the center of the park was turned into a military training ground, with firing ranges for artillery and muskets. During the Restoration, Louis-Philippe took 170 acres of the forest and built barracks and military offices. In 1860 Napoleon III ceded a large part of the forest to the city of Paris and Alphand began to turn it into a place for relaxation and recreation for the working-class population of eastern Paris. Much of the land in the center of the park was retained by the military, so Haussmann was obliged to buy additional private land around the perimeter of the park, making the Bois de Vincennes much more expensive to build; the Bois de Vincennes cost 12 million francs, while the Bois de Boulogne cost 3.46 million francs. Covering 995 hectares, it was slightly larger than the Bois de Boulogne, making it the largest park in the city. As he had done in the Bois de Boulogne, Alphand designed and dug twenty-five hectares of lakes, rivers, waterfalls and grottos. The city's chief gardener, Barillet-Deschamps, planted three hundred hectares of lawns and one hundred forty-eight hectares of flower beds. The hydraulic engineer Belgrand built a water channel from the Marne River, and pumps to hoist the water up thirty-five meters to a lake in the park, which served to water the park and to fill the lakes, streams and cascades. Davioud decorated the new park with fantasy temples, cafes kiosks and chalets. The park was completed with the addition of a racetrack, the Hippodrome de Vincennes, in 1863, a public firing range for pistols, rifles, and archery; and the Imperial farm, with orchards, fields, sheep and cows, so the urban residents of Paris could see a real farm at workDe Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins d'Haussmann, pp. 75‚Äì81. The Bois de Vincennes was the site of the cycling events of the 1900 Olympics, in a forty-thousand seat stadium built especially for that event. The Park was also the site of two large Colonial Expositions, in 1907 and 1931, celebrating the peoples and products France's empire. Several vestiges of the exhibits remain, including the old pavilion of French Cameroon, which was converted into a Buddhist temple and Institute in 1977. The Paris zoo was built for the 1931 exposition, and moved in 1934 to its present location in the east of the park, next to a sixty-five meter high man-made mountain, inhabited by alpine goats.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 119‚Äì121. =Parc des Buttes Chaumont (1864‚Äì1867)= The site of the Parc des Buttes Chaumont in 1852 The lawns of the Parc des Buttes Chaumont on a sunny day The Parc des Buttes Chaumont, twenty-seven hectares in size in the north of the city, was an unpromising site for a garden; The soil was very poor, and the land bare of vegetation; its original name was \\"Chauvre-mont\\" or \\"bald hill.\\" In medieval times, it was close the site of the gibbet, where the corpses of excited criminals were displayed. From 1789 it served as a sewage dump, and much of the site had been used as a stone quarry Alphand began to build in 1864. Two years and one thousand workers were required simply to terrace the site and to bring in two hundred thousand square meters of topsoil. A small railroad line was built to carry the earth. Gunpowder was used to blast the rock, and to sculpt the 50-meter- high central promontory. A two hectare lake was dug at the foot of the promontory. Alphand laid out five kilometers of paths and roads, and Belgrand installed pumps and pipes to hoist water from the Ourq canal to supply the cascades and lake and water the new gardens. Davioud designed a grotto, using the tunnels of the old stone quarry; a circular temple, based on the Temple of Vesta, Tivoli, to crown the promontory, as well as four bridges to span the lake. The park opened on April 1, 1867, the opening day of the Paris Universal Exposition.De Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins d'Haussmann, pp. 101‚Äì107 An urban legend says that bodies of Communards killing during the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune are entombed inside the old stone quarries in the Promentory. In fact 754 bodies were placed there briefly for a short time after the fighting ended, but were buried in the city cemeteries soon afterwards.du Camp, Maxime, Les Convulsions de Paris, Hachette, (1881), p. 303. (Full text available on line from Internet Archive). =Parc Montsouris (1865‚Äì1878)= The Palais de Bardo was a landmark of Parc Montsouris until burned down in 1991 The lake of Parc Montsouris Parc Montsouris was the last of the four large parks created by Napoleon III at the four cardinal points of the compass around Paris. It was precisely south of the exact center of Paris- a monument in the park placed by Napoleon I indicated the prime meridian which French maps used until 1911, instead of Greenwich, as the zero degree of longitude. Napoleon III decreed to construction of the park in 1865, but purchasing the land took time, and work did not begin until 1867. Work was also delayed because several hundred corpses that had been placed in the catacombs of Paris, part of which lay under the park, had to be moved. The park was inaugurated in 1869, but was not actually finished until 1878, under Alphand, who continued his work as the Director of Public Works of Paris under the French Third Republic. Parc Montsouris, 15.5 hectares in area, had all the elements of a classical Second Empire garden in a smaller space; a lake, a cascade, winding paths, a cafe, a guignol theater, lawns and flower beds. It also had a remarkable folly: the Palais de Bardo, a reduced-scale replica of the summer residence of the beys of Tunis, which had originally been part of the Paris Universal Exposition of 1867. Made of wood and stucco, it was installed in the center of the park, where it served as a weather station, but gradually suffered from vandalism and neglect. It burned down in 1991, and was not replaced.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 129‚Äì132 Gardens of the Belle Epoque and the Universal Expositions (1871‚Äì1914) The Serres d'Auteuil (1898), next to the Bois de Boulogne, provide trees, shrubs and flowers for all the parks of Paris Napoleon III was captured by the Germans during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the Second Empire was replaced by the French Third Republic. The new government named Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand the Director of Public Works of Paris, and he continued the work he had begun under the Emperor and Haussmann. He finished Parc Montsouris and several smaller squares, including square Boucicault (now Square Maurice- Gardette) and square d'Anvers (1877). Much of Alphand's abundant energy was devoted to the building of the universal expositions of 1878 and 1889, each of which included extensive gardens. He was in charge of building the Paris Exposition of 1889, including the construction of the Eiffel Tower. It was his last great project before his death in 1891.De Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins d'Haussmann, pp. 142‚Äì143. The construction of new squares and gardens was carried during the Third Republic by one of Alphand's prot√©g√©s, the architect Jean Camille Formig√©. While he did not undertake any new large parks on the scale of those of Alphand, he built a series of new squares in the Paris neighborhoods; square Ferdinand Brunot; square Fr√©d√©ric Lema√Ætre; square Adolphe Ch√©rioux; square du Vert-Galant; square des Epinettes, and the square des Ar√®nes de Lut√®ce. His most impressive accomplishment was the Serres d'Auteuil (1898), an ensemble of greenhouses which provided flowers, trees and shrubs for all of the parks of Paris. =Jardins du Trocad√©ro (1878‚Äì1937)= At the Exposition of 1878, the gardens of the Trocadero displayed the full- size head of the Statue of Liberty, before the statue was completed and shipped to New York. The Trocadero Palace and gardens at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900. The Trocadero had originally been the site of a country house of Catherine de' Medici, then of a monastery, destroyed during the French Revolution. Napoleon had projected to build a palace for his son there; King Louis XVIII planned to build a monument there to the Battle of Trocadero in 1823. Under Napoleon III, Alphand had built a basin, paths radiating outwards, a large lawn, and a stairway descending from the hill down the edge of the river.Jarrass√®, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 164‚Äì165. When the site was chosen in 1876 for the part of the Paris Universal Exposition of 1878, the architects Gabriel Davioud and Jules Bordais were chosen to construct the Palais de Trocadero, a massive temporary structure in a vaguely Moorish style, with large rotunda flanked by two towers, with curving wings on either side. The gardens, designed by Alphand, occupied the slope from the Palace on the top of the hill down to the Seine. The center of the garden was occupied by a long series of cascades ending in a large basin at the bottom at the bottom of the hill. The cascade was lined with statues of animals and of female figures representing the five continents (the statues now decorate the square next to the Mus√©e D'Orsay). The largest piece of statuary in the garden was the head of the Statue of Liberty, made before the rest of the statue, and displayed in order to raise funds for its completion. When the Exposition was finished, the gardens were redesigned into an English landscape garden; groves of trees were planted, winding paths laid out, and a stream and grotto were constructed. The gardens remained in place for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889. For the Paris International Exposition of 1937 the palace was replaced by a modernist structure and the fountains were rebuilt, but the picturesque gardens on the hillsidewere left as they were. (See parks and gardens of the 1930s below). =Champ-de-Mars (1908‚Äì1927)= The gardens surrounding the huge exposition hall of the 1867 Paris Universal Exposition, held on the Champ-de-Mars. The Champ-de-Mars gardens (1908‚Äì1927) seen from the Eiffel Tower The Champ de Mars, 24.5 hectares in area, was created in 1765 as a parade ground and training field for the neighboring √âcole Militaire. During the French Revolution it was the site of large patriotic festivals, including the Festival of the Supreme Being conducted by Robespierre in 1794. It was surrounded by a moat and not open to the public until 1860, when Napoleon III filled in the moat and planted trees along the borders, but it still remained the property of the Army. It was the site of the 1867 Paris Universal Exposition, which featured a large domed pavilion in the center, surrounded a garden, which itself surrounded by a large oval- shaped gallery. The rest of the Champ de Mars was occupied by exposition halls and extensive landscape gardens, designed by Alphand. The Champ-de-Mars served again as the main site of the Paris Universal Exposition of 1878. A gigantic palace of glass and iron 725 meters long occupied he center of the park, surrounded by gardens designed by Alphand. For the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889, celebrating the centenary of the French Revolution, Alphand placed the Eiffel Tower in the center, near the monumental Gallery of Machines. The Exposition included a Palace of Fine Arts and a Palace of Liberal Arts. The space around the Eiffel tower and between the galleries and palaces was filled by a large landscape garden, which extended along the axis between the Eiffel Tower and the Seine, and ended at the river at a colossal fountain with a group of allegorical figures, called The City of Paris Illuminates the World with her Torch. The fountain was lit at night by electric lights shining up from the water through plates of colored glass. In 1889, the Champ-de-Mars was formally transferred from the French army to the City of Paris. It was used once more for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900, and, then, beginning in 1909 until 1927, it was developed into a public park. It was an unusual site; it was the only large park in Paris not enclosed with a fence, and it was crossed by three major boulevards. The huge Gallery of Machines, which occupied much of the site, was demolished in 1909. The park architect was Jean Camille Formig√© (1849‚Äì1926), a prot√©g√© of Alphand. He used the long central axis from the Eiffel Tower to √âcole Militaire to create a formal and symmetrical park in the French style. The long central axis was lined with paths and rows of trees; a basin with fountains was placed in the center; playgrounds were built along the sides. The original gardens from the 1889 exhibition, around the Eiffel Tower, were preserved in their original form and can still be seen. Like other French formal gardens, it was best seen from above, in this case from the top of the Eiffel Tower.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 166‚Äì168 Parks and gardens of the early 20th century The monumental gateway of the pavilion of the S√®vres porcelain factory at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 is found in Square Laurent- Prache, on the south side of the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pres. Several small parks were created between 1901 and the beginning of World War II. Square Laurent-Prache was created in 1901 on the north side of the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, on the site of the old Abbey of Saint-Germain, which was destroyed during the French Revolution in 1790. The wall of the church next to the park is decorated with gothic arcades taken from the destroyed Chapel of the Virgin. The centerpiece of the park today is a bronze head made by Pablo Picasso in 1959, in homage to the poet Apollinaire. The oldest tree in Paris, an acacia planted in 1601, found in Square Ren√©-Viviani Square F√©lix-Desruelles was built in the same year along the south wall of the church. The little square is dominated by a colorful enameled gateway of the Pavilion of the S√®vres porcelain factory from the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 182‚Äì183 Square Ren√©-Viviani, created in 1928, is located next to the church of Saint- Julien-le-Pauvre, across the Seine from the Cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-Paris. Its most famous feature is the oldest living tree in Paris, a robinier, a variety of acacia, which was planted there in 1601 by the botanist Jean Robin. The park also contains a medieval well and fragments of gothic architecture from Notre-Dame Cathedral, taken out during its 19th-century restoration.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 183 =Gardens of Sacr√©-C≈ìur (1924‚Äì1929)= The gardens below the Basilica of Sacr√©-C≈ìur The building of Basilica of Sacr√©-C≈ìur at the top of Montmartre was first proposed after the 1870 defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, It was also the place where the Paris Commune began in March 1871 with the killing of two French generals by mutinous soldiers of the Paris National Guard. Alphand's plan called for a park that would descend eighty meters from the parvis in front of the church to the street at the bottom of the hill. The architect Jean-Camille Formig√© designed a park with a dramatic and unobstructed approach to the church from the bottom of the hill; he designed two terraces, connected by stairways and by curving horseshoe-shaped ramps, lined by trees. Formig√©s plan also called for a cascade and fountains parallel to the stairways, but these were never built. The work on the church began in the 1880s, but proceeded very slowly, because of the difficulty of anchoring the church to the hillside, site of a former quarry. The Basilica was not dedicated until 1919. Formig√© died in 1926, and the work on the gardens was finished by L√©opold B√©vi√©re, and dedicated in 1929. The original name of the park was Square Willette, but in 2004, under the socialist government of Mayor Bernard Delenoye, it was renamed Square Louise Michel, after the anarchist and revolutionary who had played an active role in the Paris Commune.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 179. Parks and gardens of the 1930s The buffet-d'eau of the Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge (1938) The 1930s saw an important change in the style of Paris gardens. From 1852 until the end of the 1920s, almost all Paris gardens had been designed by Jean- Charles Adolphe Alphand (1817‚Äì1891) and his prot√©g√©, Jean Camille Formig√©, and they all had a similar picturesque style. Beginning in the 1930s, each Paris garden had a different designer, and the styles were varied. They tended to be more regular and more geometric, more like the classical French formal garden, and made greater use of sculpture, particularly the work of the modernist sculptors of the period. The gardens also tended to be smaller, and were placed in the outer neighborhoods, near the edge of the city.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 182‚Äì187 Several of the new parks were built on land which had been the old fortified zone around the city, a wide strip where no building was allowed, created between 1840 and 1845 by Adolphe Thiers. The land was finally turned over to the city in 1919, and supporters of green space urged that it be turned into a belt of parkland around the city, but instead the government of the Third Republic chose to use much of the land for public housing and industrial sites. Instead of a circular belt of green space, they built a series of small squares, including square du Serment du Koufra (1930) in the 14th arrondissement; square du Docteur-Calmette (1932) in the 15th arrondissement; and square Marcel-Sembat (1931) in the 18th arrondissement. The most important landscape architects of the period were L√©on Az√©ma, a classically trained artist who won the prestigious Prix de Rome, who designed a dozen squares, including the Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge; and Roger Lardat, who designed series of squares and also redesigned parts of the Bois de Vincennes and the gardens of the Trocadero. Other notable Paris parks, gardens and squares of the 1930s are those of the Cit√© Internationale Universitaire de Paris (1921‚Äì1939); Parc Kellerman (1939‚Äì1950); Square Saint-Lambert (1933); Square S√©verine (1933‚Äì1934); Square Sarah Berhardt and Square R√©jane (1936); Parc Choisy (1937); Square Ren√©-Le-Gall (1938); and Square Barye (1938). =New Jardins du Trocad√©ro (1937)= The Palais de Chaillot, and gardens and fountains built for the 1937 Exposition. The major Paris architectural and landscape project of the 1930s was the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in 1937, on the hill of Chaillot. The old Palace of Trocadero, which had been used in two previous exhibits, was demolished and replaced by a large terrace with a panoramic view of the Seine and Eiffel Tower, and by the modernist white Palais de Chaillot, with two wings which enveloped the top of the hill. The picturesque landscape gardens on the slopes of the hills, built by Jean-Charles Alphand for the 1878 exposition were preserved, The 21 hectares of new gardens were designed by L√©on Az√©ma and the architects Carlu and Boileau. The central element of the garden became a series of cascades, lined with statues, and a long basin containing rows of fountains and two powerful water cannon. The basins, fountains and dramatic lighting at night were designed by Roger-Henri Expert, who also designed the interior decoration on the famous French ocean liner Normandie. Many of the statues from the exposition, by the leading French sculptors of the time, were kept in place after the Exposition, or found new homes in the other new city parks of the period.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 201‚Äì202 =Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge (1939)= The Square de la Butte-du- Chapeau-Rouge, (1939), in the 19th arrondissement The Parc de la Butte-du- Chapeau-Rouge, originally known as the Square de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge, in the 19th arrondissement, is one of a series of squares built in the old fortified zone which surrounded the city since the reign of Louis-Philippe. It was designed by L√©on Az√©ma, and was similar to his plan for the gardens of the Trocadero two years earlier. The broad lawns and winding paths took advantage of the steep slope and served as a showcase for sculpture. The main architectural features are the buffet d'eau, or cascading fountain, at the lower entrance, crowned by a statue of Eve by sculptor Raymond Couv√®nges (1938) and a classical portico with sculpture serving as the entrance to a playground. At the high end of the park, Two belvederes, reached by winding paths, offer panoramic views of the city. =Parc Kellermann (1939‚Äì1950)= Parc Kellermann (1939‚Äì1950), in the 13th arrondissement Parc Kellermann was built at the same time as the Square de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge, at the southern end of the city, at the edge of the 13th arrondissement. It was slightly larger than Chapeau-Rouge, (5.55 hectares compared with 4.68) which entitled it to be called a park rather than a square. It originally served as a site for several of the several smaller pavilions of the 1937 Exposition. The park was designed by the architect Jacques Gr√©ber, who was architect-in- chief of the 1937 exposition, and who also had a notable career in the United States, where he designed the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia. The site of the park had two different levels; much of the park was built in the old bed and banks of the Bi√©vre river, now covered over. Gr√©ber merged two different styles; the lower part of the park is picturesque, with a lake, stream, false rocks, groves of trees, winding paths and the other characteristic features of a park of the time of Napol√©on III. The upper part, bordered by boulevard Kellermann, is a 1930s combination of classicism and modernism, with a cement portico, two brick excedres decorated with bas-relief sculptures in the 1930s style; a large parterre and basin; and long tree-lined alleys. The upper part of the park today offers exceptional views of the city, but also suffers from the noise of the neighboring highway that circles Paris.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 193‚Äì195 Parks and gardens of the late 20th century (1940‚Äì1980)  Following the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the priority shifted from making parks to making playing fields and other sports facilities, following the ideology of Marshal Philippe P√©tain and Vichy France regime. In 1939, Paris had twenty hectares of sports fields; In 1941 the Paris government published a plan to build an additional two hundred hectares of sports facilities and playing fields, mostly using the vacant land in the old fortified zone on the edge of the city.Jarrasse, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 210. The emphasis given to playgrounds and sports fields continued in the years after the War. The priorities of the successive French governments were the repair of the infrastructure destroyed by the War and building public housing. A number of squares were created, though most of the space was usually devoted to playgrounds rather than gardens. The new parks and squares included Squares Docteurs-Dejerine (1958), Emmanuel-Fleury (1973) and Leon Frapie (1973) in the 20th arrondissement; Squares Emile-Cohl and Georges-Melies (1959) in the 12th arrondissement; the squares around the porte de Champerret in the 17th arrondissement; and the square de la Porte-de-Plaine (1948-1952) in the 15th arrondissement. Square Andre-Ullmann (1947), in the 17th arrondissement, is one of the typical postwar gardens; symmetrical and austere, it occupies a triangular space, with a pavilion with a rotunda in one corner, two alleys of plane trees, a central green, and bushes and shrubs carved into geometric shapes. Square Emmanuel-Fleury, a picturesque landscape garden in the 20th arrondissement Square Emmanuel Fleury (1973) in the 20th arrondissement, with an area of 2.34 hectares, is larger than most of the postwar gardens, and, while it has sports fields, including a course for roller sports, it is more in the picturesque Napeoleon III style than the other postwar gardens, with rich flower beds, winding paths, groves of trees and kiosks. Square Sainte- Odile (1976), in the 17th arrondissement, by landscape architect Jean Camand, was one of the first of a new model of gardens which appeared in the 1980s and 1990s; occupying a small space (1.13 hectare), it was divided into different spaces, each with a different style and theme, often radically different; next to a church, it includes a landscape garden in one section; a playground in another, a picturesque butte with a pavilion; a central basin with an abstract sculpture; and a monument to the harpist Lily Laskine. =Parc floral de Paris (1969)= The garden of the Japanese pavilion in the Parc Floral de Paris The largest new garden created in Paris in the second part of the 20th century was the Parc floral de Paris, covering 31 hectares, which was built within the Bois de Vincennes in 1969. In 1959 and 1964 that park had been the site of a large international flower show, the Floralies internationales, and the two events had been so popular that the city decided to make a permanent site for flower exhibitions. Land was ceded to the city from military installations within the park, and the new gardens were created under the direction of landscape architect Daniel Collin. The new park was an ensemble of different flower gardens with different themes; a valley of flowers; a garden of contemporary sculptures; a water garden; and a children's garden, as well as pavilions for indoor displays and exhibits of exotic flowers, Japanese bonsai and other botanical attractions. A Garden of the Four Seasons was added in 1979, with flowers in bloom from early spring until the end of autumn. The park also featured an outdoor theater for musical events, and small lakes and fountains. =Jardin Tino-Rossi (1975‚Äì1980)= The Jardin Tino-Rossi combines a promenade along the Seine and an open-air museum of late 20th century sculpture In the 19th century, the site of the Jardin Tino-Rossi, on the quai Saint-Bernard in the 5th arrondissement, had been the place where wine barrels were unloaded from barges for sale at the nearby Halle aux vins. In 1975, government of President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing decided to make the quai into a promenade, featuring rows of plantane trees planted along the quai in the 19th century, and a series of small garden amphitheaters by the edge of the water. In 1980, a more ambitious element was added; an outdoor sculpture garden featuring over fifty works by late 20th-century sculptors, including Alexander Calder, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, and Jean Arp. While the promenade is generally considered a success, the works of sculpture have suffered over time from degradation and vandalism.Jarrasse, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 214 Parks of the Mitterrand era (1981‚Äì1995) During the fourteen-year presidency of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, coinciding with the bicentennial of the French Revolution, Paris saw an explosion of major public works projects, including the Op√©ra Bastille, the Louvre pyramid and underground courtyard, and the new national library. The Mitterrand projects included opening one hundred and fifty new parks, squares and gardens, a larger number than those constructed under Napoleon III, though the total area of the new parks was much smaller. Unlike the Second Empire, when all the new gardens followed the same basic plan and picturesque style, the Mitterrand-era gardens were built by different architects and landscape architects, and offered a wide variety of styles and designs, from miniature recreations of natural wilderness to high-tech. Many of the new parks and gardens, such as La Villette, were built on former industrial sites, and a majority were built in the outer neighborhoods of the city, where the population was most dense. Most all of the new parks featured works of contemporary art and sculpture.Jarrasse, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 220‚Äì221. The landscape architect Bernard Tschumi, who designed the gardens of the Parc de la Villette, tried to explain the philosophy of the new parks in a book entitled The Parks of the 21st Century (1987) : \\"The conditions of the modern city have made invalid the historic prototype of a park as an image of nature. The park can no longer be conceived as a model of a utopian world in miniature, protected from vulgar reality. Rather than a place of escape, the contemporary park should be seen as an environment defined by the preoccupations of the inhabitants of the city, of their recreation needs and the pleasures defined by the working conditions and cultural aspirations of contemporary urban society.\\"cited in Jarrasse, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 246. =Parc Georges-Brassens (1984) = The centerpiece of Parc Georges-Brassens is the belfry of the old auction market of the abattoirs of Vaugirard. Parc Georges-Brassens (15th arrondissement), occupying 7.4 hectares, is located on the site of the former Vaugirard slaughterhouse and horse market from 1894 to 1897, which were demolished between 1969 and 1979. The design, by architects Ghiulamila and Milliex and landscape architect Daniel Collin, preserved picturesque elements of the original market, including the belfry of the old auction market of the abattoirs of Vaugirard, and the covered horse market, which now serves on weekends as the site of an antiquarian book market. Modern sculptures of horses stand at the entrance to the garden. Corners of the park are occupied by a pre-school and day care center, and a theater. The landscape garden in the center of the park, in the picturesque tradition of Alphand and the Second Empire, has a lake, winding paths, flowerbeds, a rose garden and a garden of aromatic plants. The slope of the park also has a dry cascade of artificial stones, for children to climb. =Parc de Belleville (1988)= The Parc de Belleville, in the 20th arrondissement, has a panoramic from the highest park in Paris, and encourages visitors to sit on the grass. The Parc de Belleville, in the 20th arrondissement, was another early Mitterrand-era park. It was designed by architect Francois Debulois and landscape architect Paul Brichet, and built on a steeply-sloping site that covered 4.5 hectares, on the hill of Belleville, the highest point in the city. The park was located not far from the Parc des Buttes Chaumont, and shared some of the same picturesque elements as that Second-Empire park, including a terrace and belvedere at the top of the park with a panoramic view of the city, winding paths along the hillsides, abundant flowerbeds and groves of trees, and a series of cascades from the top of the hill down to a semi-circular basin, then under Rue Julian Lacroix to a circular basin in another garden in the jardin de Pali-Kao, a miniature park of three thousand square meters opened in 1989. Visitors to the park are invited to sit on the abundant lawns of the park, a practice long discouraged in Paris parks. Like Buttes-Chaumont, the Parc de Belleville originally had a grotto, built into the side of the old stone quarries, but it had to be closed because of vandalism and security concerns. =Parc de la Villette (1987‚Äì1991)= Parc de la Villette, like a high-tech amusement park, has ten different thematic gardens and playgrounds The Parc de la Villette was formerly the main slaughterhouse of the city, located in the 19th arrondissement at the intersection of the Canal de l'Ourq and the Canal Saint- Denis. One structure remains from the old site, the Grande Halle, built in 1867 by Jules de Merindol, a student of Baltard, who had built the famous glass and iron structures of Les Halles. In 1982, and international competition selected landscape architect Bernard Tschumi to design the park. The final design was composed of ten thematic gardens, which Tschumi described as a \\"cinematic promenade\\" of different sights and styles.Jarresse, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 242‚Äì246. The Parc de la Villette is more in the category of a high-tech amusement park, like Disneyland or Tivoli Gardens, than a traditional park. Twenty hectares of the fifty-five hectare site are devoted to buildings and structures, including the Cite des Sciences et de l'industrie, the Cite de la Musique, the Zenith performance hall, a full-sized submarine, and the central landmark, the mirror-surfaced Geode, a geodesic dome. The ten thematic gardens include playgrounds and small peaceful sanctuaries; they include a garden of mirrors, a garden of shadows, a garden of islands, a garden of bamboos, a garden of dunes, and several thematic playgrounds, including one with a slide in the form of a dragon. The gardens also feature works of sculpture by noted artists and sculptors, including Claes Oldenburg and Daniel Buren. =Parc Andr√© Citro√´n (1992)= Parc Andr√© Citro√´n (1992), on the site of an old automobile factory, offers high-tech greenhouses, broad lawns and a variety of small thematic gardens. Parc Andr√© Citro√´n, located on the Seine in the 15th arrondissement, was the site of the Citro√´n automobile factory from 1915 until the 1970s. The plan for the new park was developed by landscape architects Gilles Cl√©ment and Alain Provost, along with architects Patrick Berger, Jean-Fran√ßois Jodry, and Jean-Pierre Viguier. Like most of the Mitterrand-era parks, it combined two very different styles of parks, a recreation park and a picturesque floral park; the centerpiece of the 24-hectare park is a large lawn, 273 by 85 meters, dedicated to recreation, sports and relaxation. The natural and pure garden aspect of the park is expressed by two very large greenhouses in the southeast overlooking the park, one an orangerie and the other displaying plants of the Mediterranean. There are also series of six small \\"serial gardens,\\" each associated with a different metal, planet, state of water, and a sense; and the \\"Garden of movement\\", a meadow of different grasses blown by the wind. A canal frames one side of the large lawn, while the serial gardens, each in its own alcove, enclose the other side.Racine, Michel, Guide des jardins en France, pp. 184‚Äì185. =Promenade plant√©e (1993)= The Promenade plant√©e, built on an abandoned railway viaduct ten meters above the city, stretches 4.7 kilometers from Place de la Bastille to the edge of the city. The Promenade plant√©e, in the 12th arrondissement, is the most original of Paris parks. The creation of landscape architect Jacques Vergely and architect Philippe Mathieux, it was built ten meters above the street on the abandoned viaduct of the Vincennes railway, which had been built under Napoleon III in 1859. The park extends 4.7 kilometers, from the site of the former Bastille station of the railroad line, close to Place de la Bastille, to Verneuil-l'√âtang, at the peripheric highway at the outer edge of the city. The park offers a variety of different landscapes, from bamboo forest to picturesque flower garden, as well as fine views of the city. It is accessed by a number of stairways along its route, and is sometimes enclosed. Preference is given to people strolling, though joggers are allowed, if they do not impede the promenaders. Because of the narrow width of the promenade, bicycles are not permitted. The Promenade plant√©e has inspired similar parks in other cities; the High Line in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, opened in 2009, and the three-mile Bloomingdale Trail in Chicago. =Jardin Atlantique (1994)= The \\"Room of undulating grasses\\" in the Jardin Atlantique, on the roof of the Gare Montparnasse railway station. The Jardin Atlantique in the 15th arrondissement, like the Promenade plant√©e, has a highly unusual site, perched on twelve concrete pillars seventeen meters above street level, atop the roof over the Gare Montparnasse railway station, which connects Paris with the west of France. It was designed by landscape architects Michael Pena and Fran√ßois Brun, and was reportedly the most expensive park built in Paris.Rancine, Michel, Guide des jardins en France/ Nord p. 186 Like the other Mitterrand-era parks, it has a central lawn, surrounded by thematic gardens and sprinkled with modern sculpture and fountains. It also has thirty openings, which provide ventilation and light for the train tracks and platforms below, and the announcements of train arrivals and departures can be heard in the park above. The design of park has a vague resemblance to the deck of an ocean liner, in keeping with the connection of the train station to the Atlantic seaports of Cherbourg and Le Havre. Because of the weight limitations and limited depth of soil, it has a high proportion of concrete and other structural materials compared to the amount of greenery. Nonetheless, the park has five hundred trees, planted in cubic stone boxes. The thematic gardens include a garden of varied moving in the wind; a garden of aquatic plants; a garden of coastal plants, a garden of blue and mauve colored flowers; and the \\"hall of silence\\", a meditation garden. =Parc de Bercy (1994‚Äì1997)= the Jardin romantique of Parc de Bercy in the autumn Parterres in the Parc de Bercy The site of the Parc de Bercy, alongside the Seine in the 12th arrondissement, was at the edge of the city limits until the time of Napoleon III. It was the site of the wine depot where barrels wine and spirits were unloaded from barges and taxed before they were delivered to the city. Under the Mitterrand program, the new park was intended as the east-Paris equivalent of the Tuileries Garden, alongside the Seine in the center of the city. The site already had a wide avenues lined by two hundred century-old chestnut and plantain trees, which, along with several old buildings from the wine depot, were integrated into the new park. Though the park was far from the center of the city, it was next to the new Palais Omnisports indoor sports facility and the Cinematheque (originally the American Center, designed by Frank Gehry) and linked by a new bridge to the new National Library across the Seine. On the river side, the park was bordered by a high terrace, which blocked the noise of the highway along the river and gave view over both the Seine and the park. The park also has an amphitheater, on the site where a neolithic village was discovered. The landscaping of the new park was designed by architects Bernard Huet, Madeleine Ferrand, Jean-Pierre Feuges and landscape architects Ian la Caisne and Philippe Raguin. Their design created three separate gardens with different themes, connected by footbridges over the streets that divide them. The western park, near at the Palais Omnisports, called Les Prairies, features broad lawns under trees; this part of the park is also used for informal sports, soccer skateboarding and rollerblading. The center park is called Les Parterres, and is devoted to serious gardening. It includes an aromatic garden, a rose garden, and a vegetable garden where school groups come to learn about agriculture and gardening. The garden on the east is called Le Jardin romantique, and it has a water theme; it includes a canal, fishponds, cascades, and a pool with water lilies.Racine, Michel, Guide des jardins en France, p. 176. Paris parks and gardens of the 21st century Following the late 20th century tradition of French Presidents constructing new museums and parks to mark their period in office, President Jacques Chirac launched the Mus√©e du quai Branly, devoted to the arts of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. In 1991, the banks of the Seine were declared a UNESCO cultural heritage site, and efforts began to make the highways and industrial space that remained along the river into a long promenade. Beginning in 2000, sections of the highways were closed on Sundays for promenades and jogging, and an artificial \\"beach\\" with sand and deck chairs was installed in summer. In 2008, during the administration of Mayor Bertrand Delano√´ (2001-2014), the city of Paris began to transform portions of the highways built along the left and right banks of the Seine into parks and recreation areas. In 2013, a 2.3 kilometer section of the left-bank highway between the Pont d'Alma and the Mus√©e d'Orsay opened as a permanent promenade, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine. =Gardens of the Mus√©e du quai Branly (2006)= The gardens of the Mus√©e du quai Branly (2006) are designed to be the exact opposite of a French formal garden; a celebration of nature. The site of the Mus√©e du quai Branly, on the left bank of the Seine, facing the Palais de Chaillot, and just a hundred meters from the EIffel Tower, had been occupied by the buildings of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Urbanism. An international competition led to selection of architect Jean Nouvel to design the new museum. The original proposal for the museum had called for a garden occupying 7,500 square meters of the 25,000 square meter site. Nouvel increased the gardens to 17,500 square meters, and made a series of different gardens an integral part of the museum. The largest section, the \\"garden of movement\\", between the rue de l'Universit√© and the quai Branly, is a composition of small gardens created by landscape architect Gilles Cl√©ment, designed to appear wild and to be the opposite of a French classical garden. The other notable feature of the garden is the Mur vegetale or \\"wall of vegetation\\", designed by Patrick Blanc; a composition of 15,000 plants of 150 different species which cover 800 square meters of the exterior facades of the museum and 150 square meters of the interior walls. The \\"wall\\" is renewed and trimmed each year.Moireau, Fabrice, Les jardins du musee du quai Branly, pp. 2‚Äì9 =Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013)= One of the floating gardens along the Promenade des Berges de la Seine in the 7th arrondissement In the 19th century and early 20th century, the paved quay of the Left Bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Mus√©e d'Orsay had been used for several international expositions, for boat docks and storage depots, and for cafes and floating swimming pool. Between 1961 and 1967, highways were built along both banks of the river to relieve traffic congestion in the center of the city. In 1991, the banks of the river were classified as UNESCO cultural heritage site, and efforts began to turn the highways into parks and promenades. Beginning in 2008, a 2.3 kilometer section of the highway was permanently closed and made into the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which was dedicated on June 19, 2013. The promenade includes five floating \\"islands\\", a total of 1800 square meters in size, placed atop barges, with trees, bushes, flowers and deck chairs. The former highway is lined with spaces for concerts and classes; outdoor exhibit space; playgrounds; a climbing wall; a discoth√®que under a bridge; and tipis and furnished containers which can be hired for lunches, celebrations or meetings. There are boat docks and several outdoor cafes along the promenade. All the facilities of the park are portable, and can be removed within 24 hours if the waters of the Seine rise too high. The promenade was designed by architect Franklin Azzi, and the islands were created by Jean-Christophe Chobet.Le Moniteur, June 19, 2013 See also *List of parks and gardens in Paris *French Renaissance garden *French formal garden *French landscape garden *Haussmann's renovation of Paris *Paris during the Second Empire *Paris in the Belle √âpoque References =Notes and citations= =Bibliography=       Category:Landscape architecture Category:Landscape design history of France Paris Paris ","title":"History of parks and gardens of Paris"},{"id":"43042867","text":"Ectillaenus is a genus of trilobites in the order Corynexochida.

It is regarded as the most important vector of these human parasitic diseases in Southeast Asia. It is the primary vector of vivax malaria (Plasmodium vivax) in many regions. In China it also transmits the filalarial parasite (Wuchereria bancrofti), and arthropod roundworm (Romanomermis jingdeensis). In Japan it is also a vector of a roundworm Setaria digitata in sheep and goats. Because of its similarity with other Anopheles, it is now considered a species complex comprising at least four species. Its genome was sequenced in 2014. Taxonomy and description An. sinensis is classified as a species complex, and is a member of An. hyrcanus group. The group is distinguished from other groups by the presence of pale bands (usually four) on the palpi and by the presence of a tuft of dark scales on the clypeus on each side in the female adult. It was first described by German naturalist Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann in 1828, and became one of the earliest known species of Anopheles. Due to its similarity with other mosquitos and geographical diversity, the species was redescribed several times by different taxonomists, with names like An. yesoensis (1913), An. sineroides (1924), An. lesetri (1936), An. pullus (1937), and An. yatsushiroensis (1951). These species are considered as either synonyms or members of the species complex. Female An. sinensis has a dark-coloured body, with its palps are shorter than proboscis. The integument of the neck region is yellow. The legs are dark-brown on outer surface, but pale on the inside. The base of the leg is swollen towards the body. The wings are covered with dark and pale scales. The tip of the wing has a prominent spot. Larva has an elongated head. Its antennae are about the length of the head, and containing pointed spicules towards the inner side. Distribution and habitat An. sinensis is found in northeast India, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Kampuchea, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. In India it is reported from Meghalaya, Assam, and Mizoram. They are found in all types of environment including naturally-made clean water, stagnant or flowing. Their major habitats are rice fields, ditches, streams, irrigation cannals, marshes, ponds, and ground pools. They mostly bite large animals, and human biting is relatively less when animals are present nearby. Their feeding takes place throughout the night from dusk to dawn, but heaviest biting occurs between 2 and 4 in the morning. Even though they are attracted by lights, they prefer to bite outdoor. They hibernate mostly under part of dense grasses during October‚ÄìMarch. At the end of the hibernation period in March‚ÄìApril they feed during daytime. In August 1962 it was found that An. sinensis was a vector of vivax malaria in Korea. It has become one of the major vectors of vivax in China. Genome The draft genome sequence of An. sinensis was published in 2014. It has 3,972 gene clusters containing 11,300 genes that were common to the genomes of the three previously sequenced mosquito species, An. gambiae, A. aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. It contains 16,766 protein-coding genes. 2377 genes had an ortholog belonging to one of the 235 known biological pathways. There are 41 microRNA, 348 tRNA and 2017 rRNA genes.

It educates according to the principles of Steiner Waldorf Education and has an enrollment of over 240 students. History The school was founded in 1974 by Christine Polyblank on receiving a letter in which Alex Baum of the Camphill Sheiling Schools requested her to start a Waldorf school for the children of their co-workers. It began in a row of labourers' cottages ‚Äì \\"Folly Farm\\" ‚Äìand opened with six pupils. New teachers and pupils rapidly joined the school and it had to move into temporary buildings. After 1980, the school began to develop its high school and by 1988 planned and built its own buildings on the piece of land where it now stands, Folly Farm, that it received from the Sheiling Trust. Campus Today the school has a modern purpose-built campus designed by Keir Polyblank, the husband of founder Christine Polyblank. He took responsibility for almost all aspects of the new build; the design, planning permission, four kindergartens, 12 classrooms, an art studio, science lab and multi-purpose hall besides some dedicated rooms for special activities such as Music, Handwork, Woodwork and Eurythmy. Curriculum Practice in the school is derived from the educational and social indications given by Rudolf Steiner (1861‚Äì1925). While it functions as an autonomous school, it is a full member of the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship in the United Kingdom (the Fellowship) and follows the Code of Practice developed by that body. Parent and Child groups welcome children from 6 months, Kindergartens from 3 to 6 years, Lower School from 6 to 14 years and Upper School from 14 to 18 years. The social practices of the school (including the financial principles) are based on the Social threefolding as developed by Rudolf Steiner, which are integrated into the educational aims and inform the management practices in the school. Extracurricular activities =Comenius School Partnership Programme= Supported and funded by the British Council and the European Commission, this is a two-year project in which the school invites foreign teachers and students to a programme of activities.

She was considered to be the Joan of Arc of India. Family She was the granddaughter of Swami Shraddhanand, and the daughter of advocate Dhani Ram and Ved Kumari. She married an officer of the Delhi Cloth Mills. Activism Among nationalist women in Delhi, Satyavati took a leadership role. Aruna Asaf Ali credits Satyavati with motivating her to join the nationalist movement. Satyavati undertook social work among mill workers at textile mills in Gwalior and Delhi. She founded the Congress Mahila Samaj and Congress Desh Sevika Dal and she also co-founded the Congress Socialist Party. She took an active part in Civil disobedience movement. During civil disobedience movement she became the leader of the women wing of the congress in Delhi and led the movement. She organised the breaking of the Salt Law in Delhi where she and a group of volunteers manufactured and distributed packets of illegal salt to people gathered there. She was arrested by the police and was sentenced to two years imprisonment in 1932. While she was imprisoned in the jail she contracted pleurisy and tuberculosis. While at jail, despite being very ill, she refused to give a bond of good behaviour and assurance that she would desist from political activity, that could have secured her release and hope for treatment. She died in 1945 at the age of 41 of tuberculosis. Writings Jailed women political freedom fighters composed poems and nationalist tracts, which were smuggled out and published.

It linked the river Thielle (German: Zihl) at Yverdon-les-Bains with the Venoge at Cossonay, a distance of 25 kilometres. It was completed in 1648, and remained in operation until 1829. Traces of some five kilometres of it still remain.  History  The Thirty Years War led to a number of projects to link the Protestant Netherlands to the Mediterranean without the dangerous sea journey round Catholic Spain. In 1635, Elie Gouriet, the Breton quartermaster-general of the French forces in the United Provinces, delivered a proposal to the government of Bern to join the lakes of Neuch√¢tel and Geneva by a canal crossing the Mormont, which formed the watershed between the two lakes, through the Gorge at Entreroches, near √âcl√©pens. The authorities agreed to the plan on the condition that the canal would run entirely through Bernese territory, making stipulations about the width of the wayleave and the exploitation of adjacent watercourses and forests. A group of investors financed the project, and work began in 1638 from the eastern end, where the river Thielle was already navigable for 8 kilometres up to the confluence of the Orbe and the Talent. The first section opened in 1640. Seven locks raised the canal 14 metres over 9 kilometres to the summit at Entreroches. The western section, falling 19 metres over 8 kilometres to Cossonay, with 6 locks, took eight more years to build, being hampered by floods, unforeseen difficulties in the cuttings, and a shortage of funds. The water supply was assured by an arm with a single lock connecting the summit level to the River Venoge at La Graveyre, close to √âcl√©pens village.Map drawn by F L Haldimand, dated 1759, in Vuitel, infra From Cossonay, the Venoge fell steeply to the level of Lake Geneva. The 40 locks needed over 12 kilometres to overcome the 59 metre height difference between Cossonay and Morges proved too much for the investors, and this section was never built. Goods had to be transhipped and carried by road. The steep fall of the Rh√¥ne below Geneva also meant that the canal never achieved more than local significance. In 1679, a new terminus was built at Le Bouquet, four kilometres north of Cossonay, and gradually this lowest section, which had been difficult and expensive to maintain, fell out of use. The canal was profitable until the mid-18th century, though the amount carried was low - around 6000 tons a year, achieving a maximum in 1719/20 of 8532 wagon-loads (approximately 6680 tons).Paul-Louis Pelet, Le canal d'Entreroches. Histoire d'une id√©e, 1946 94% of the traffic was from south to north. The main cargo (85%) was wine from the vineyards around Lake Geneva and salt from Gex, for transport to Bern and Solothurn. The Plessis-Gouret family continued to be responsible for its operation. Profitability declined at the end of the 18th century, and a shortage of funds led to a lack of maintenance. Bankruptcy was declared in 1797. The collapse of the aqueduct carrying the River Talent over the canal near ChavornayPierre-Andr√© Vuitel, La fabuleuse aventure du canal d'Entreroches, 2011, published by Association D√©veloppement 21 in 1829 finally led to the canal's abandonment. The land passed to the Caisse d'√âpargne de Neuch√¢tel (the Neuchatel Savings Bank), and subsequently to the Canton of Vaud.Article in Le conteur vaudois : journal de la Suisse romande (61), 1923 A permanent navigable connection between the Rh√¥ne and the Rhine was finally achieved in France in 1833 with the completion of the Canal du Rh√¥ne au Rhin.  Operation  A towpath ran the length of the canal. Haulage appears to have been by teams of three men. The locks were mainly turf-sided, and of the guillotine kind. The lock gates were lifted by a large wheel some 5 metres in diameter.Pierre-Andr√© Vuitel, La fabuleuse aventure du canal d'Entreroches A notable feature of this canal was that all lock gates were left open and the bed was left dry during the summer months when it was not in use. When a cargo was expected, a sluice was opened to allow water from the Venoge to enter the summit level, the lock gates were closed and the canal filled. No picture of the boats using the canal has survived. From documentary evidence, we know that they were some 20 metres in length, 3.5 metres broad, drawing 0.75 metre. They carried about 25 tons, and were flat-bottomed, with a pointed prow and a square stern. They were steered with a long oar, or gaffe.

Built about 1742, it is the oldest surviving house in Currierville, one of the early settlement areas in South Hampton. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Captain Jonathan Currier House stands at the three-way intersection of Hilldale Avenue with Currier Street and Lone Goose Road. It is set facing south toward the intersection and close to the road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central brick chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance flanked by simple pilasters and topped by a transom window and cornice. A single-story ell extends at an angle from the rear of the house, parallel to Hillside Avenue. The house, a typical vernacular Georgian style construnction, was built c. 1742 by Jonathan Currier, whose family was among the early settlers of the western part of South Hampton, and for whom the area is named Currierville. It is the oldest house standing in the area, a significant agricultural settlement in the 18th and 19th centuries. Because of its proximity to nearby Newton, the area's residents, including Currier and others in his family, twice petitioned the state (without success) to become part of Newton.

A polygon covering problem is a problem of finding a covering with a smallest number of units for a given polygon. This is an important class of problems in computational geometry. There are many different polygon covering problems, depending on the type of polygon being covered and on the types of units allowed in the covering. An example polygon covering problem is: given a rectilinear polygon, find a smallest set of squares whose union equals the polygon. In some scenarios, it is not required to cover the entire polygon but only its edges (this is called polygon edge covering) or its vertices (this is called polygon vertex covering). In a covering problem, the units in the covering are allowed to overlap, as long as their union is exactly equal to the target polygon. This is in contrast to a packing problem, in which the units must be disjoint and their union may be smaller than the target polygon, and to a polygon partition problem, in which the units must be disjoint and their union must be equal to the target polygon. A polygon covering problem is a special case of the set cover problem. In general, the problem of finding a smallest set covering is NP- complete, but for special classes of polygons, a smallest polygon covering can be found in polynomial time.  Basic concepts  A unit u contained in a polygon P is called maximal if it is not contained in any other unit in P. When looking for a polygon covering, it is sufficient to consider maximal units, since every unit which is not maximal can be replaced with a maximal unit containing it without affecting the size of the covering. A covering of a polygon P is a collection of maximal units, possibly overlapping, whose union equals P. A minimal covering is a covering that does not contain any other covering (i.e. it is a local minimum). A minimum covering is a covering with a smallest number of units (i.e. a global minimum). Every minimum covering is minimal, but not vice versa.  Covering a rectilinear polygon with squares  A rectilinear polygon can always be covered with a finite number of squares. For hole-free polygons, a minimum covering by squares can be found in time O(n), where n is the number of vertices of the polygon. The algorithm uses a local optimization approach: it builds the covering by iteratively selecting maximal squares that are essential to the cover (- contain uncovered points not covered by other maximal squares) and then deleting from the polygon the points that become unnecessary (- unneeded to support future squares). Here is a simplified pseudo-code of the algorithm: *While the polygon P is not empty: **Select a continuator square s in P. **If the balcony of s is not yet covered, then add s to the covering. **Remove the balcony of s from P. **If what remains of s is a one-knob continuator, then remove from P a certain rectangle adjacent to the knob, taking care to leave a sufficient security distance for future squares. thumb For polygons which may contain holes, finding a minimum such covering is NP-hard. This sharp difference between hole-free and general polygons can be intuitively explained based on the following analogy between maximal squares in a rectilinear polygon and nodes in an undirected graph: * Some maximal squares have a continuous intersection with the boundary of the polygon; when they are removed, the remaining polygon remains connected. Such squares are called \\"continuators\\" and are analogous to leaf nodes ‚Äì nodes with a single edge ‚Äì that can be removed without disconnecting the graph. * Other maximal squares are \\"separators\\": when they are removed, the polygon splits into two disconnected polygons. They are analogous to nodes with two or more edges that, when removed, leave a disconnected remainder. In a hole-free rectilinear polygon, all maximal squares are either continuators or separators; thus, such a polygon is analogous to a tree graph. A general polygon is analogous to a general graph. Just like the Vertex cover problem is polynomial for tree graphs but NP-hard for general graphs, the square covering problem is linear for hole-free polygons but NP-hard for general polygons. It is possible to use the linear algorithm to get a 2-approximation ‚Äì i.e., a covering with at most 2‚ãÖOPT squares, where OPT is the number of squares in a minimum covering:Prof. Reuven Bar-Yehuda in personal communication * For each hole, find a square s connecting the hole to the external boundary. * Cut s from the polygon, then glue back two overlapping copies of s (see figure). The resulting polygon is not planar, but it still 2-dimensional, and now it has no holes. * Now use the original algorithm to find a minimum covering. The number of squares in the resulting covering is at most OPT+HOLES, where HOLES is the number of holes. It is possible to prove that OPT‚â•HOLES. Hence the number of squares in the covering is at most 2‚ãÖOPT.  Covering a rectilinear polygon with rectangles  For general rectilinear polygons, the problem of finding a minimum rectangle covering is NP-hard, even when the target polygon is hole-free. Several partial solutions have been suggested to this problem: 1\\\\. In orthogonally convex polygons, the number of rectangles in a minimum covering is equal to the number of blocks in an anti rectangle, and this fact can be used to build a polynomial time algorithm for finding a minimum covering by rectangles. 2\\\\. Even when the target polygon is only half-orthogonally convex (i.e. only in the y direction), a minimum covering by rectangles can be found in time O(n2), where n is the number of vertices of the polygon. 3\\\\. An approximation algorithm which gives good empirical results on real-life data is presented by. 4\\\\. For rectilinear polygons which may contain holes, there is an O() factor approximation algorithm.  Covering a rectilinear polygon with orthogonally convex polygons  For a rectilinear polygon which is half- orthogonally convex (i.e. only in the x direction), a minimum covering by orthogonally convex polygons can be found in time O(n^2), where n is the number of vertices of the polygon. The same is true for a covering by rectilinear star polygons. The number of orthogonally-convex components in a minimum covering can, in some cases, be found without finding the covering itself, in time O(n).  Covering a rectilinear polygon with star polygons  A rectilinear star polygon is a polygon P containing a point p, such that for every point q in P, there is an orthogonally convex polygon containing p and q. The problem of covering a polygon with star polygons is a variant of the art gallery problem. The visibility graph for the problem of minimally covering hole-free rectilinear polygons with star polygons is a perfect graph. This perfectness property implies a polynomial algorithm for finding a minimum covering of any rectilinear polygon with rectilinear star polygons.  Covering a polygon without acute angles with squares or rectangles  The most general class of polygons for which coverings by squares or rectangles can be found is the class of polygons without acute interior angles. This is because an acute angle cannot be covered by a finite number of rectangles. This problem is NP-hard, but several approximation algorithms exist., Grazyna Zwozniak, 1998  Covering a polygon with rectangles of a finite family  In some cases, a polygon has to be covered not with arbitrary rectangles but with rectangles from a finite family.  Covering a polygon with triangles  Finding the smallest set of triangles covering a given polygon is NP-hard. It is also hard to approximate - every polynomial-time algorithm might find a covering with size (1+1/19151) times the minimal covering. If the polygon is in general position (i.e. no two edges are collinear), then every triangle can cover at most 3 polygon edges. Hence every Polygon triangulation is a 3-approximation. If the covering is restricted to triangles whose vertices are vertices of the polygon (i.e. Steiner points are not allowed), then the problem is NP-complete. If Steiner points are not allowed and the polygon is in general position (i.e. no two edges are collinear), then every minimal covering without Steiner points is also a minimal partitioning of the polygon to triangles (i.e., the triangles in the minimal covering to not overlap). Hence, the minimum covering problem is identical to the Polygon triangulation problem, which can be solved in time O(nlogn). Note that if we drop the general position assumption, there are polygons in which the triangles in the optimal covering overlap. Think of the Star of David for example. The problem of covering only the boundary of a polygon with triangles is NP-complete, but there is an efficient 2-approximation.  Covering a polygon with convex polygons  Covering a polygon (which may contain holes) with convex polygons is NP-hard. There is an O(logn) approximation algorithm. Covering a polygon with convex polygons is NP-hard even when the target polygon is hole-free.. It is also APX-hard. The problem is NP-complete when the covering must not introduce new vertices (i.e. Steiner points are not allowed).  Covering a polygon with star polygons  Covering a simple polygon with star polygons is \\\\exists\\\\mathbb{R}-complete, as is the version where a point in the kernel of each star must be contained in an edge of the polygon.  Other combinations  Covering a polygon (which may contain holes) with spirals is NP-hard. Covering a polygon with Pseudotriangles has also been studied. Additional information can be found in.

In 1971, Lee became the first Republican Mayor of Fayetteville, North Carolina, of the 20th Century. He served as the city's Mayor for two consecutive, two-year terms from 1971 to 1975. Lee was also elected Chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party in April 1977. He is widely credited with unifying the state Republican Party during his tenure as chairman. Biography =Early life and broadcasting career= Lee was born on April 8, 1920, in Fremont, Nebraska. His father, Earl Lee, served as a member of the Nebraska Legislature for fourteen years. Jack Lee received his bachelor's degree in 1941 from the University of Nebraska. He then served in the United States Army Air Corps in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Lee moved to Delaware after the war, where he initially worked as a reporter for radio stations in the Delaware Beaches region. He rose to become a radio station manager. In 1960, Lee purchased WFAI-AM (present-day WFAY), a radio station in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He moved to the city with his wife, Virginia, and their three children. Lee hired Curt Nunnery as a station radio personality. Under Lee, WFAI-AM became the first radio station in eastern North Carolina to air daily editorials shows hosted by Jesse Helms. He publicly supported Helms' candidacy for the United States Senate in 1972. Lee sold WFAI in the early 1970s to focus on his political career. =Political career= Lee was a conservative Republican, while the Fayetteville region was a Democratic stronghold during the 1960s. Lee became the Republican campaign manager for Cumberland County, laying the foundation for future Republican gains in the area during the 1970s. He began his political career in 1964, when he ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for a North Carolina Senate seat. Lee was soundly defeated, garnering just 30% of the vote against his Democratic opponent. Lee had later stated that he ran in 1964 so the Republican Party would at least have a candidate in that election. Lee became the Chairman of the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce from 1965 to 1968. He was also active in a variety of other business and civic organizations. In 1971, Jack Lee won the nonpartisan Fayetteville mayoral election by defeating city councilman Denny Shaffer in a landslide. While the election was nonpartisan, Lee made history by becoming Fayetteville's first Republican mayor of the 20th Century. U.S. President Richard Nixon appointed Mayor Lee to a national education council in 1973. Lee was re-elected to a second, two-year term as Mayor in 1973. However, he declined to seek re-election in 1975. Lee was succeeded by Democrat Beth Finch, who became Fayetteville's first female mayor. Jack Lee focused on joining the leadership of the North Carolina Republican Party after leaving the mayoral office. Prominent supporters of Lee included U.S. Senator Jesse Helms and political activist Thomas F. Ellis. Lee was elected Chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party unopposed at the party's conference on April 16, 1977, after his opponent, Bill Hiatt, withdrew. The state Republican Party was deeply divided at the time between rival supporters of Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. Lee is widely credited with unifying the North Carolina Republican Party following a long period of political infighting. Under Lee, who believed that Republican themes would appeal to the state's conservative-leaning Democrats, Ronald Reagan won North Carolina in the 1980 presidential election. In 1983, President Reagan appointed Lee as the Federal Communications Commission's director of legislative affairs. Lee returned to radio after retiring from politics, working at radio stations in coastal North Carolina during the 1980s and 1990s. However, he continued to work as a radio sales representative into his 80s. He eventually moved to New Mexico to be closer to his family. Jack Lee died in Farmington, New Mexico, on June 10, 2014, at the age of 94. His health had declined since suffering from a respiratory illness during Fall 2013. He was survived by his second wife, Pam. His first wife, Virginia Lee, had died several years prior to his death.

Primarily from the Neotropical realm, reaches highest genus and species diversity in South America. Their size varies from 3.5 to 35 mm long, and its colour patterns are diverse. As well many has colourful iridescent scales (bluish, greenish or golden), others show opaque scales or setae, and some are subglabrous. In habitats with sparse vegetation or trees absence, the occurrence of flightlessness and parthenogenesis is frequent. Females of Naupactini usually lay their eggs between adjoining surfaces (e.g. in litter between fallen leaves, in cracks in the soil, and in crevices of tree trunks and calices of fruits), in batches covered by an adhesive substance (Marvaldi, 1999). Their ectophytic larvae live in soil where they feed externally on the roots of their host plants (Marvaldi et al., 2002, 2014; Oberprieler et al., 2014). Although naupactine weevils are capable of eating a large range of different foods, the majority of them show at least some preference for certain plant families, especially Fabaceae (Lanteri et al., 2002). Several species are considered agricultural pests in both their native ranges and places where they have been introduced due to human activities (Lanteri et al., 2013a). Due to being agricultural pests in many crops and being considered of major fitosanitary importance, biological control with parasitic nematodes is being developed.Paola Luppichini B., Andr√©s France I., Irina Urtubia H., Natalia Olivares P. y Fernando Rodr√≠guez A.

The single story wood-frame Greek Revival structure was built in 1840 as a church; according to local legend, timbers from a 1740 church were used in its construction. Its main facade has a simple entrance topped by a transom window, and flanked by a pair of windows. The building is topped by a three- stage tower, whose second stage houses a belfry, and whose spire is topped by a weathervane in the shape of a quill pen. It was used as a meeting house until about 1878, with its dual use as a school beginning c. 1870. It was dedicated for academic use in 1878, after the local Universalist congregation which had been using for services, built its own dedicated building. This building is said to have acquired its distinctive weathervane as a gift in 1870 from schoolmaster Bartholomew Van Dame. The building was moved closer to the center in 1952, at which time it was mounted on a concrete foundation, and a sympathetic addition was made to increase its capacity. In 1995 a new central elementary school was built, and the addition was converted for use as a police station. This building was again moved to provide parking space for the police, and has been adapted for use as a local history museum and community center.

It connects the central Holstein town of Neum√ºnster with Bad Oldesloe, the seat of the district of Stormarn. Since December 2002, passenger services on the line have been operated by Nordbahn Eisenbahngesellschaft. History  Bad Segeberg station Bad Oldesloe station The line was opened on 10 December 1875 by the then Altona-Kiel Railway Company (Altona-Kieler Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, AKE). In 1884, the railway company was nationalised. Until 1945, the line was considered as an extension of the Hagenow Land‚ÄìBad Oldesloe railway in Mecklenburg. The kilometre stones of this route still stand on the track (the zero stone is in Neum√ºnster). The track is currently given the route number 1043 beginning in Neum√ºnster (at km 74.376) and ending in Bad Oldesloe (km 119.886). The line had strategic importance as it was possible for trains to run on the route from Neum√ºnster to Hamburg via Bad Segeberg. This was used mostly for freight transport. From the late 1950s to the 1970s an express service ran on the Flensburg‚ÄìNeum√ºnster‚ÄìBad Oldesloe‚ÄìHamburg ran route in the morning. Passenger traffic on the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìBad Segeberg section was closed on 29 September 1984. Part of the line continued to be used for freight and the whole line was kept operational. Freight operations were abandoned between Kleinkummerfeld and Rickling on 25 September 1988 and between Neum√ºnster and Kleinkummerfeld on 30 May 1990. As the Federal Transport Ministry had not approved the abandonment of passenger traffic on the rest of the route as requested by Deutsche Bundesbahn, passenger services on the remaining section from Bad Segeberg to Bad Oldesloe were operated hourly from the summer 1989 timetable. Deutsche Bundesbahn operated class 628 diesel multiple units. In December 2002, the disused section was reactivated for passengers after numerous delays. The existing Kleinkummerfeld station was not put back into operation until 1984. Rickling- √ñlweiche station had been abandoned at the time of cessation of services between Neum√ºnster and Bad Segeberg in 1984 and had not been maintained for several years before that. Neum√ºnster S√ºd AKN station and Wahlstedt station have only been served since the reactivation of the line. Current operations  The line is currently operated hourly by Nordbahn Eisenbahngesellschaft with Alstom Coradia LINT diesel multiple units. All trains serve the entire route and stop at all stations, although Alteng√∂rs and Fresenburg are request stops. The journey takes around 45 minutes. Both the state, as purchaser of services, and the operating company were surprised by the high numbers of passengers. The trains are often crowded at peak times. As a first step, a parallel bus service was introduced because the platforms at some stations are too short for operating double sets. However, a double set has been used since 12 December 2011 in the morning from Neum√ºnster at 6:37 and from Oldesloe at 7:42, and in the afternoon from Neum√ºnster at 16:37 and from Oldesloe at 17:42. Only the three front doors of the trains can be used at the short platforms.  Future  The line has been proposed for duplication and electrification by the Federal Ministry of Transport, Construction and Urban Development. This would benefit both freight and passenger operations. In 2010 a review of the plan showed a benefit-cost ratio of 0.6 for the about ‚Ç¨300 million project and therefore it could not be financed with federal funds. This is due to lower demand for freight than originally assumed in the original plan, as it has since been decided to proceed with the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link.

It is located at 210 Main Street (New Hampshire Route 111A). The 2-1/2 story wood frame building was completed in 1887, replacing the old 18th-century meetinghouse. It houses the town offices, and a meeting space in which town meetings and other civic and social events take place. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Danville Town House stands in the rural town center of Danville, on the east side of Main Street between Gerry Drive and the Baptist church. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and exterior finished in a modern synthetic imitation of clapboards (with the original wooden clapboards underneath). It has modest nods toward late 19th-century Victorian architecture, including slightly parapeted gables with projecting ends. The front porch originally had turned posts and a spindled valance; it has been replaced by square posts and balusters. On the inside, the town offices are located on the ground floor, while the second floor has a ballroom with a stage area at the eastern end. The building was constructed in 1887, after the town's 18th-century meetinghouse was judged inadequate to meet the town's needs for municipal functions. This building's location in southern Danville was not without controversy: some objected to its more elaborate Victorian styling, and farmers in the northern part of the town objected to its relatively remote location, but were outvoted by more numerous southerners. An attempt was made to burn the building down the night before its dedication. The ballroom has been used for many public and private functions, including use by local civic groups, the Grange, and the Boy Scouts.

At the time of her death on 26 October 2010, she was India's oldest living freedom fighter. She did her schooling from Kanya Maha Vidyalay, Jalandhar. She married Lala Achint Ram in 1925. Her marriage was a dowry-less one and she wore no veil, which was the condition set by Achint Ram for marriage. She was popularly known as Bijji or Mataji. She was the mother of India's former Vice President, Krishan Kant. She also had two daughters Nirmala and Subhadra. On 26 August 1942 she was arrested along with her children for participation in the Indian freedom movement. Along with other women prisoners she hoisted the Indian tricolour in Lahore Jail where she was imprisoned by the British. In prison she protested against the condition of barracks of political prisoners and went on a satyagraha. Post India's independence, she took an active part in Vinoba Bhave's bhoodan movement along with her husband Lala Achint Ram (who died in 1961) who was popularly called \\"Gandhi of Punjab\\". He had been member of Lok Sabha twice. They both urged the landowners to give their land to landless laborers. The revolutionary leader Chandrashekhar Azad stayed at her home for three days before his escape to Lahore. She had often fed the patriot Bhagat Singh with her own hands. Her daughter Subhadra, when arrested was only 13 years old and was the youngest freedom fighter to be arrested. In 1965, she donated all her jewels to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund. She was always respected by everyone who came to her home. Her son Krishna Kant became the Governor of Andhra Pradesh in 1989 and continued there until 1997, when he was elevated to the post of Vice President. Krishna Kant took his mother to his home during both occasions. When her son died in 2002, she was sitting beside his body until it was taken for cremation. She outlived him for eight years, dying on 26 October 2010 aged 105, outliving many of her younger co-workers. She was cremated with all state honours at her native village on the next day. A year before death on 9 August 2009, she was honoured by then President Pratibha Patil as a part of the 67th anniversary commemoration celebrations of Quit India Day.

Its titular is the Nuestra Se√±ora del Aguas Santas (also Immaculate Conception) and its feast is celebrated every December 8.  History  The town of Los Ba√±os started as a visita of Bay under the Augustinian order with St. Nicolas de Tolentino as titular. In 1590, Franciscans replaced the Augustinians in their missions with Fray Pedro Bautista, later canonized as San Pedro Bautista. He discovered numerous hot springs in the area which locals called Maynit. He created a public bath he called the ‚ÄúLos Ba√±os\\". After twenty years, the Franciscans established a temporary convent to administer the hot springs that were popular for healing illnesses. A small hospital chapel was built in 1613 in the absence of a church until 1727 dedicated to the Our Lady of Immaculate Conception, with the title Aguas Santas. It was brought down by fire in 1727. A temporary chapel was built out of nipa and cane which was later destroyed again by fire. A big stone church was built in 1790 by Father Domingo Mateo, OFM in its present site. The belfry, sacristy and tile roofing were supervised by Father Manuel Amat in 1851 and the convent in 1852. The convent and bell tower were destroyed during the 1863 earthquake but repairs were made during the administration of Fathers Manuel Rodriguez and Gilberto Martin in 1880. It was also used in World War II as headquarters for the Japanese forces where it was used as a garrison by the Japanese during World War II.  Devotion  The local image of the Virgin Mary under the titular of the Immaculate Conception is known as the Nuestra Se√±ora del Aguas Santas (also Virgin of the Holy Waters). The image of Immaculate Concepcion was said to be miraculous. Some of the miracles includes the wetting of the Virgin‚Äôs robes up to the shoulders, amor seco growing from the hems of her garments and mysterious footprints all over the church leading to her altar. Due to the popular devotion to the Virgin and miracles attributed to her, the church is currently petitioning to become a diocesan shrine.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android in July 2014. The game is an idle game in which the only influence the player can have on the game is at the start of the game where the player is tasked to draw objects. The game is designed to be played in the background while the player uses other applications. Gameplay Mountain is described by its creator David OReilly as a \\"Mountain Simulator, Relax em‚Äô up, Art Horror etc.\\" game, featuring little interactivity from the player. Upon starting the game, the player is asked to draw responses to a series of questions, described by OReilly as \\"more psychologically invasive than anything Facebook wants to know about you\\". The game uses that input to generate a model of a mountain, floating in space, surrounded by a small sphere of atmosphere. At this point, the game lacks significant interactivity; while the player can rotate the view around the mountain and zoom in and out, they cannot affect the mountain in any way. The game is set to be run in the background as the player does other activities on their computer. Over the course of the game, the mountain slowly rotates as accelerated time progresses through day and night cycles and through seasonal changes: the player will see snow form and melt on the mountain, plants and trees grow and wither out. Randomly, the mountain may be hit by everyday objects which then become embedded in the mountain indefinitely. The mountain periodically offers its thoughts to the player as the game progresses. After around fifty hours while the game has been running, the mountain meets its fate when it crashes into a passing giant star, ending the game, at which point the player can start the game over with a new mountain. This can be avoided by repeatedly pressing buttons on one's keyboard which forms a shield around the mountain that protects it from getting destroyed. Development David OReilly had developed a number of fictional video game sequences for the movie Her (2013). Following his involvement, OReilly had interest in creating a real video game, wanting \\"to explore in patterns and iterations of patterns\\". He considered the idea of simulating a mountain as \\"an iconic zen thing\\", and that the size of mountains dwarf that of the human experience; mountains further \\"defy objectification because they can't be owned or put in a museum\\". OReilly described Mountain as \\"visual silence\\", and that it is \\"about letting go of control\\" while one watches the simulation. To develop the game, OReilly started learning the Unity engine himself. To complete Mountain, gained assistance from Damien Di Fede who did most of the game's coding. OReilly had revealed the game during the Horizon video game showcase held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles during the same week in June as the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The game was published by Double Fine Productions under their \\"Double Fine Presents\\" label aimed for small indie games. The title was initially released on July 1, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and iOS platforms; the Android version was delayed until August 19, 2014 due to the cost of getting the Unity plugin for Android. OReilly had initially visioned the game to run as a background application for personal computers, and thus had not spent a great deal of time optimizing the iOS version through the Unity engine. However, within a week of its release, Mountain was one of the top-selling titles on various app store charts, prompting OReilly to develop more optimization for the iOS and pending Android versions. Reception The game was generally praised by reviewers as a novel concept for a game, though because of its limited interactivity, many players were discontent with the title, comparing it to a screensaver rather than a game. Zack Kotzer of Vice compared the game to the Tamagotchi toys, though lacking the need to constantly attend to the toys' demands and instead letting the player decide when to see how the mountain is progressing. Others described the title as a passive Katamari game, watching how the mountain accumulates stuff over the course of the game. Some reviewers found the title pretentious; Ben Kuchera of Polygon felt the game may have been a joke by OReilly, and expressed that he did not feel the same sense of wonder that other journalists had found in the game.

Koch made a name for himself as a member of the band Jahcoozi before launching a solo artist. His electronic music sound has been called \\"Wonderful and Strange - pop music from the future\\" by John Peel of the BBC, in 2003.http://www.blueraincoatmusic.com/robert-koch/ Background Koch was introduced to the piano at six years of age, and later to the drums at thirteen. He has said that both instruments were helpful in his later years as a composer, giving him a foundation in a harmonic and a rhythmic understanding of music. He worked as a composer and producer in Berlin up until 2013, when he relocated to Los Angeles, California. While Koch has been releasing his own original material on the labels Monkeytown Records, Project Mooncircle, Bpitch Control, and Four Music, he has been a successful producer, remixer, and collaborator for other musicians such as Tensnake, Norah Jones, Bassnectar, and Max Richter. He has worked as a producer and composer for both indie and major artists worldwide, and has won gold and platinum records for his production work for Marteria, Casper, and K.I.Z.http://www.wepublishmusic.com/index.php/artists-songwriters.html In 2014, he won the German Music Composers Award in the category \\"Best Electronic Music Composer\\". Koch's music has been used in numerous television shows and films, including NBC's The Blacklist, ABC's How to Get Away with Murder, MTV's Teen Wolf, and the trailer for San Andreas. Projects In 2016, Koch launched his own label, Trees and Cyborgs. In 2018, he co-created the immersive audio-visual project \\"Sphere\\" in collaboration with visual artist Mickael Le Goff. For the project, Koch's 2018 album Sphere was transformed into film and a visual exploration of space, and exhibited in full-dome venues and planetariums around the world. The full-dome show was designed to transport the audience through space and time using custom projection visuals and atmospheric music, presented in a 3D sound environment. As part of his work, Koch has also explored modern classical compositions. For the ninth edition of Neue Meister at DRIVE Forum Berlin, the artist, together with Australian violinist and composer Savannah Jo Lack, wrote and performed six pieces that were exclusively composed for the Neue Meister series. The music for this series was released in 2019.

Career In January 2013, Pallett entered PDC Q School and stood just one match from joining the tour in the second event, but lost 6‚Äì5 to Louis Blundell. However, after all four events had been played he had done enough through the Q School Order of Merit to earn a two-year PDC tour card. Pallett qualified for the first European Tour event of the year, the UK Masters and beat top 20 player Paul Nicholson 6‚Äì3 in the opening round before losing by a reverse of this scoreline to two-time world champion Adrian Lewis in the second round. He reached the last 16 of a PDC event for the first time in June at the fifth Players Championship where he was beaten 6‚Äì3 by Terry Jenkins. At the Dutch Darts Masters, he saw off established players Mark Walsh and Dave Chisnall, before Brendan Dolan eliminated Pallett in the third round. In the beginning of the 2014 season, Pallett threw a nine-dart finish at the third UK Open Qualifier. He entered the UK Open itself at the second round stage and defeated Gary Spedding and Kevin McDine to reach the last 32 where Gary Anderson won 9‚Äì5. Pallett defeated Jamie Lewis and Andy Hamilton at the German Darts Masters, before reigning world champion Michael van Gerwen eliminated him 6‚Äì4 in the third round. Two more last 16 appearances in Players Championship events followed which contributed to Pallett earning ¬£11,750 during the year on the Pro Tour Order of Merit, which saw him make his debut at the 2015 World Championship by taking the 11th of 16 places that were on offer to non-qualified players. Pallett played two-time winner of the event Adrian Lewis in the first round and took out a 161 finish in the first leg, but lost each set by three legs to one in a 3‚Äì0 defeat. He moved to world number 48 after the event. At the 2015 UK Open, Pallett defeated Mark Dudbridge, Andy Smith and Colin Fowler to play in the fourth round of the event for the second year in a row. He faced Phil Taylor and was beaten 9‚Äì3. In September, Pallett averaged over 100 in knocking out both Jamie Caven (100.73) and Jelle Klaasen (104.83) at the European Darts Matchplay. His run continued with 6‚Äì5 wins over Alan Norris and Kim Huybrechts to reach the semi- finals of a PDC event for the first time, where he lost 6‚Äì3 to Dave Chisnall. This result was a huge factor in Pallett qualifying for his second successive World Championship, where he will play Huybrechts in the first round. Pallett missed two darts to take a 2‚Äì1 set lead over Kim Huybrechts in the first round of the 2016 World Championship. However, after Huybrehcts took the opening leg of the fourth set, Pallett reeled off six straight legs to win 3‚Äì2, which included 132 and 122 finishes in the last two games. In the second round both Pallett and Mensur Suljoviƒá missed darts at doubles for nine-dart finishes. There was never more than a set between the players, with Suljoviƒá taking the final set by three legs to one. He reached the quarter-finals of the first UK Open Qualifier and lost 6‚Äì2 to Phil Taylor. His third round match with Raymond van Barneveld at the UK Open went to a deciding leg in which the Dutchman threw an 11 darter to win 9‚Äì8. It was a tough rest of the year for Pallett, but he did reach the last 16 twice towards the end of it, losing 6‚Äì3 to Steve West at the 18th Players Championship event and 6‚Äì4 to Mensur Suljoviƒá at the German Darts Championship. Pallett regained his PDC Tour Card in January 2019 via the Order of Merit, sealing at least two years on the ProTour.

The hotel, opened in 2000, is built in the traditional Newar architecture on 37 acres of land. It is operated by Taragaon Regency Hotels, and employs 400 workers. The hotel was built under public- private partnership with 40% public ownership and 60% private. It recorded losses for 22 years, during which the public ownership of the hotel shrunk to 9%, and later began registering record profits. The public land on which the hotel was built was in the process of being privatised at extremely cheap rates. Parliamentary committees began investigating possible financial irregularities by the private partners, including the possibility that Taragaon Regency Hotels deliberately showed losses in order to illegally gain ownership stake on the hotel by decreasing the share prices and buying them back cheaply, while deterring investment from others. The Auditor General's office and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority also investigated the activities of Taragaon Regency Hotels. As of 2020, Taragaon Development Committee, the entity representing public interests in the hotel, is attempting to reclaim the land into public ownership. The hotel Hyatt Regency is the biggest five-star hotel in Nepal. Located near the Bouddhanath stupa, the hotel stretches over 37 acres. The building incorporates elements of the traditional Newar architecture; the decorations in the lobby and around the premises include Buddhist chortens and other decorative motifs. It has 280 guest rooms, including seven suites. The hotel is operated by Taragaon Regency Hotels. It is listed at the Nepal Stock Exchange. =Workers= The hotel employs around 400 workers, 320 of them affiliated to All Nepal Hotel, Casino and Restaurant Workers Union. The hotel suspended its services for a week in 2019, when workers affiliated with the union went on strike, alleging that the management had cut worker facilities and benefits even as the hotel's net profits increased significantly. The strike was later called-off upon request from the Ministry of Labour.  History  The establishment of the hotel was approved in 1992 under public‚Äìprivate partnership. The public interest was represented by Tourism Ministry's Taragaon Development Committee; the private partners were Radheshyam Sharaf and Ramlal Shrestha families. The public investment amounted to Rs 170 million (40%); the private investment was Rs 257.5 million (60%). For public investment, half of the land on which the hotel was to be built was sold to the hotel for a stake of 40%, and the other half was retained in public ownership and leased to the hotel. Estimated to cost Rs 1.5 billion including a proposed cultural museum, it cost Rs 3.4 billion to bring into operation, without the museum, which was never built. It came into operation on 31 August 2000, and was formally inaugurated by King Birendra the next month. The hotel continuously recorded losses for 22 years, deterring investment. By 2017, the public share in the hotel had shrunk to 9%; the ownership of original private investors increased slightly to around 62%. Public representation on the board of directors had shrunk to one member out of eleven, from three members out of nine in 1993; the Sharaf and Shrestha families had seven seats on the board. By 2019, the hotel was registering record profits with quarterly revenues of more than Rs 1 billion. =Hyatt Regency scandal= According to a 2017 report by Nagarik Daily, the original private partners, the Sharaf and Shrestha families, with the collusion of government officials, showed losses for the hotel for years, decreasing the price of the shares and buying them back to increase their ownership, while officials persuaded governments to not invest in it. It reported that the 37-acre public land that the hotel was built on, was in danger of falling into private ownership due to decreasing public share in the hotel. The government representative assigned the only seat at the Board of Directors had been boycotting the board meetings in protest. One investigative committee had submitted its report to the Ministry but no action was taken on it. With records showing losses, the partners had successfully avoided paying dividend to small shareholders or paying taxes, while the hotel's assets kept growing. In November 2018, speaking to a parliamentary committee, the chief of Taragaon Development Committee and public representative to the Board of Directors who had been boycotting board meetings, said that the public land the hotel was built on was in the process of being converted into shares and privatised at extremely cheap rates. He demanded an independent audit of the hotel's financial records. The Office of the Auditor General published a report concluding that financial irregularities had been committed in value re- assessment of the land. The parliamentary Public Accounts Committee started an investigation. In April 2019, a subcommittee of the parliamentary International Relations Committee, finding irregularities in share and land ownership transfers that resulted in reduction of public ownership to 9%, directed the government to take immediate steps to regain the land leased to Taragaon Regency Hotels. It also directed the government and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) to launch investigation into possible illegal conduct by Taragaon Regency in recording losses for the hotel for 22 years in order to benefit itself at the cost of public investment, as well as other financial irregularities. CIAA submitted its report to the government in September 2019. According to Nayapatrika, as of June 2020, Taragaon Development Committee has sent a formal letter to the Tourism Ministry, to begin the process of reclaiming Hyatt's land into public ownership. Awards The hotel won the Service Excellence Award 2017, awarded by Luxury Travel Guide at the Asia and Australasia Awards. It had previously won the same award in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2016; it won again in 2018 and 2019.

He uses the nickname The Undertaker for his matches due to him being of fan of WWE's Undertaker. BDO career Kevin Thomas has been playing darts from the early age of 6, but started out properly as a 15 year old Glamorgan Youth Player in 1995. He got picked for The Wales Youth Team in 1995,1996 and 1997 and throughout his Youth years, he was a dominant force in Youth darts winning the Southern Inter Counties Under 18 Youth Averages 2 times and the Under 21 Averages 2 times. In 1999, Thomas reached the final of the British Teenage Open where he lost 3‚Äì1 against Matt Chapman. He competed consistently in BDO County Men's 'A' games for Glamorgan and played for Wales Men 28 times with 15 wins from those appearances. He also competed in BDO tournament events in the coming years with his best success reaching the last 24 televised stage of The 2011 Winmau World Masters where he lost out to Steve Douglas 2-0. He also represented Wales in the 4 man Wales World Cup Squad in The Republic of Ireland in 2011 where he lost in the last 64 of the Men's Singles to Finland's Jarkko Komula. PDC career After a brief spell in the mid 2000s in the early days of the PDC which involved going around different Greene King pubs to qualify for events, Thomas rejoined the 'reformed' PDC in 2013 and hit his first competitive nine-dart finish whilst playing in the second UK Open Qualifier against Peter Hudson. He qualified for the UK Open in Bolton for the first time at the first time of asking through the UK Open Order Of Merit and lost out to Conan Whitehead in the second round. Thomas' best result of his career to date came at the 2014 Dutch Darts Masters where he beat Wayne Jones 6‚Äì1 and Steve Beaton 6‚Äì5, before he lost 6‚Äì4 to Mervyn King in the last 16 earning ¬£2,000 in the process. Thomas matched this run at the sixth Players Championship of the year by beating Peter Hudson, Andy Hamilton and Ronnie Baxter, but was then eliminated 6‚Äì4 by Kyle Anderson. Another last 16 defeat came in 2015 at the second Players Championship event, 6‚Äì5 at the hands of James Wade, but Thomas went one better at the fourth event by reaching his first PDC quarter-final. He came through a trio of deciding leg games against Magnus Caris, Andy Smith and Andy Boulton and beat Andy Hamilton 6‚Äì3, before losing 6‚Äì1 to world number one Michael van Gerwen. His best result of 2016 came at the Dutch Darts Masters, where he beat Jan Dekker 6‚Äì3, before losing by a reversal of this scoreline to Dave Chisnall in the second round picking up ¬£1,500 in the process. Other than that he reached the last 64 in three more events during the year. Thomas still competes regularly on the PDC circuit and currently holds the record for the most wins in Q School whilst not officially owning a full PDC tour card. Thomas still regularly enters the Q School, Pro Tour and Euro Tour events (OOM circumstances permitting) but due to a lack of serious sponsorship in recent years, he hasn't entered so many. At the moment, Thomas is currently an associate member of the PDC which means he is a regular on The PDC Challenge Tour and his aim is to get as high up in these ranking events to secure a full time PDC Pro Tour Card to enter more professional PDC events in the future and to get back to where he knows he deserves to be playing. Aside from that, Thomas still plays his local darts in his home town of Swansea where he has been dominating the Super Leagues and Local Leagues he plays in for many years. Thomas is also a multiple time tournament winner and has won countless local and Welsh Ranking Tournaments around the Welsh valleys. Thomas recently starred in the Welsh Darts Program Oci Oci Oci which aired on S4C on 22 June 2019.

Its first product was to be the castAR, a pair of augmented reality and virtual reality glasses. castAR was a founding member of the nonprofit Immersive Technology Alliance. History castAR was founded by two former Valve employees; the castAR glasses were born out of work that started inside Valve. While still at Valve, their team had spent over a year working on the project. They obtained legal ownership of their work after their departure. In August 2015, Playground Global funded $15M into castAR to build its product and create mixed-reality experiences. In August 2016, Darrell Rodriguez, former President of LucasArts, joined as the new CEO. In addition, Steve Parkis became President and COO, after leading teams at The Walt Disney Company and Zynga. In September 2016, they opened castAR Salt Lake City, a new development studio formed from a team hired out of the former Avalanche Software, which worked on the Disney Infinity series. In October 2016, they announced the acquisition of Eat Sleep Play, the developer best known for Twisted Metal, also in Salt Lake City UT.http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-02-castar-adds-entire- eat-sleep-play-dev-team-to-utah-studio In December 2016, Parkis, who had been President and COO, was named CEO to replace Rodriguez.https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/castar-by-technical- illusions#/entity In June 2017 it was reported by Polygon that CastAR was shutting down, laying off 70 employees. A core group of administrators was expected to remain, to sell off the company's technology. In September 2019 Jeri Ellsworth initiated a Kickstarter for a new device based on the same principles called Tilt Five. The company uses CastAR technology acquired from the former startup and is founded by CastAR alumni Jeri Ellsworth, Amy Herndon, Jamie Gennis, and Anthony Aquilio castAR GDC Next 2013 attendees The castAR glasses combine elements of augmented reality and virtual reality. After winning Educator's and Editor's Choice ribbons at the 2013 Bay Area Maker Faire, the castAR project was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter. castAR surpassed its funding goal two days after the project went live and raised over $1 million on a $400,000 goal. castAR creates hologram- like images unique to each user by sending an image from tiny projectors on the glasses into the user's surroundings using a technology that Technical Illusions called \\"Projected Reality\\". The image bounces off a retro-reflective surface back to the wearer's eyes. castAR can also be used for virtual reality purposes, using its VR clip-on. Before the time of the 2017 company shutdown all Kickstarter funds had been paid back to the original backers. Along with the repayment, a coupon for a free set of the production AR glasses was given to each backer. This happened at the time of the 2015 Playground Global investment. Funding Forterra Systems has so far raised $35 million. In February 2008, it received $10 million funding for corporate virtual worlds.

It is a semi-autobiographical novel with touches of magic realism which relates a year in the life of a young Thai boy living with eccentric elderly relatives in a gilded estate hidden in an apparently ordinary soi in 1960s Bangkok. Plot summary A twelve-year-old boy, known as Little Frog to his family and Justin to his few friends, is left in the care of three strange aristocratic aunts and a rather frightening uncle until he is old enough to attend Eton school in England. In order to prepare himself for his intended future, he insists on speaking only English and will eat only bacon and eggs for breakfast, though he is prepared to accept Thai dishes at other meals. In this peculiar situation the boy finds himself between three worlds, the Thai world of his family and his regal ancestors and their apparently pointless rituals, the western world of logic and common sense which he finds more compatible with his temperament and the imaginary world of his sheltered childhood. Imagining himself to be a great scholar and philosopher, Justin enlists the aid of an African American boy and the family gardener's son and sets out to convert his school classmates from their ingrained bigotry and racism.

Some species also infect wild mammals such as deer and antelope. The genus consists of about 43 species. Members of the genus are uniquely parasites in the abdominal cavity of the body. They are mostly large-sized roundworms, possessing an elaborate head (cephalic) region that is characterised by spines, presence of four lips, and well-guarded mouth. Little is known about their pathogenic effects, but some are known to affect nervous system and eye. The larval infective forms are transmitted from one animal to another by the bite of mosquitoes and flies. In addition Setaria marshalli can be transmitted from the womb to new-born calf. A rare case of human infection was recorded in 2016 from a 15-year-old Iranian girl, who was diagnosed with Setaria equina in her eye. Species Some important species of the genus are: *Setaria cervi which are parasites of buffalo, bison, deer and antelope. They are capable of migrating to central nervous system causing serious neurological disease. They are found worldwide and predominantly in Europe and Asia. Stable fly Haematobia stimulans is the major vector. *Setaria digitata which are parasites of cattle in Asia. It was introduced to Mauritius. Different species of mosquitoes including those of Aedes, Culex and Anopheles are vectors. In central Japan Anopheles sinensis is the major vector. *Setaria equina which are parasites of horses, mules, and donkeys, and also capable of infecting cattle and camels. Mosquito species of Aedes are the primary vectors. They are most prevalent in Kenya. *Setaria javensis which are parasites of mouse-deer in Malaysia. They are transmitted by Aedes togoi. *Setaria labiotapapillosa which are parasites of cattle, as well as other domesticated animals. Aedes togoi and Anopheles hyrcanus are the vectors in Japan, while Mansonia spp. are vectors in Kenya, and Aedes caspius in Italy. *Setaria marshalli which are parasites of cattle.

He turned up by chance at a meeting to nominate Admiral Vernon as candidate for Westminster at the forthcoming 1741 general election and found himself put forward as the Admiral's running-mate. At the election, the High Bailiff arbitrarily closed the poll early and brought in soldiers for protection when he declared the Government candidates elected. A committee of independent electors including gentry and lawyers was formed to challenge the result. Parliament declared the election void on the grounds of the presence of soldiers, and the bailiff was found to have been given secret funds and ordered to be imprisoned. The Government could field no candidates at the rerun of the election and Edwin was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Westminster on 31 December 1741. At the 1747 Edwin was returned unopposed as MP for Glamorgan. He was returned again unopposed at the 1754 general election. Death and legacy Edwin died without issue on 29 June 1756. He left Llanmihangel Plas to his sister Ann, who had married Thomas Wyndham. Their son Charles Wyndham changed his name to Edwin on inheriting the estates on the death of his mother.

The name is also used more specifically in to refer to Bezirk Lothringen, that part of Lorraine that belonged to the German Empire from 1871‚Äì1918.  Former German-speaking Lorraine  The Germanic-Romance (German-French) language boundary in Lorraine roughly followed the line from Sarrebourg (Saarburg) to Hayange (Hayingen) until well into the 20th century. A detailed map of the boundary is given in the article on the Lorraine Franconian dialect. The Lorraine region northeast of this linguistic boundary in the present-day d√©partements of Moselle and Bas-Rhin (the Alsace bossue) and in the present-day federal state of Saarland was called German Lorraine (Deutsch-Lothringen). Nancy, the historic capital of Lorraine, and Metz, the present capital of the region of Lorraine, both lie on the French side of the boundary. There are clues to the historic boundary in the names of settlements like Audun-le-Tiche (Deutsch-Oth or German Audun) and Audun-le-Roman (Welsch-Oth or Romance Audun) or the names of the two headstreams of the Nied, the Nied Allemande (Deutsche Nied or German Nied) and the Nied Fran√ßaise (Franz√∂sische Nied or French Nied), which lie on either side of the language boundary and merge almost exactly on the line itself. The linguistic boundary was also reflected early on in the administration of the region. In the 13th century, the Duchy of Lorraine was divided into three bailiwicks (administrative and juridical districts. German: Ballei, French: Bailliage): the Bailiwick of Nancy (Bailliage de Nancy), the Bailiwick of Vosges (Bailliage des Vosges) and the German Bailiwick (Bailliage d'Allemagne); the last-named periodically had its administrative seat in the town of Wallerfangen in present-day Saarland. The Duchy of Lorraine went to France in 1766. In 1790, during the time of the French Revolution, the old administrative structures were radically changed. The request by German Lorraine members of parliament to establish a German Lorraine d√©partement did not gain majority support in the French National Assembly.Jean-Louis Masson: Histoire administrative de la Lorraine: des provinces aux d√©partements et √† la r√©gion, Fernand Lanore / Sorlot, Collection: Reflets de l'Histoire (1982), transcript of the petition on p. 193. Online So in 1790, German Lorraine was incorporated into the newly created d√©partements of Moselle and Meurthe. Other German-speaking parts of historic Lorraine lay in the d√©partement of For√™ts formed in 1795 and the D√©partement de la Sarre created in 1798. In the Second Treaty of Paris in 1815 the largest part of German Lorraine remained with France. From then on the name referred to this region.  Bezirk Lothringen as part of the German Reich 1871-1918  After the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, part of Lorraine was annexed by the newly founded German Empire and, together with Alsace formed the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsa√ü-Lothringen) until 1918. The newly formed Bezirk Lothringen, which was created from parts of the former French d√©partements of Meurthe and Moselle, covered not just the majority of historical German Lorraine but also the French-speaking regions west of the Franco-German language boundary around Metz and Ch√¢teau-Salins. Bezirk Lothringen, with Metz as its capital, remained unchanged in its territorial composition after the return of the region to France in 1919 and formed the present d√©partement of Moselle. During the German occupation of 1940‚Äì1944 it became the CdZ-Gebiet Lothringen (\\"Territory of the Chief of Civil Administration of Lorraine\\").

Its widespread adoption into other cuisines is traced to the early 20th century.  Europe  =Italy= Pizza Margherita Pizza al taglio in Rome Pizza quattro stagioni Authentic Neapolitan pizzas (pizza napoletana) are typically made with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. They can be made with ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of origin). According to the rules proposed by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, the genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of wheat flour (type 0 or 00, or a mixture of both), natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast, salt and water. For proper results, strong flour with high protein content (as used for bread-making rather than cakes) must be used. The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other machine, and may be no more than thick. The pizza must be baked for 60‚Äì90 seconds in a stone oven with an oak-wood fire. When cooked, it should be crispy, tender and fragrant. There are three official variants: pizza marinara, which is made with tomato, garlic, oregano and extra virgin olive oil, pizza Margherita, made with tomato, sliced mozzarella, basil and extra-virgin olive oil, and pizza Margherita extra made with tomato, sliced buffalo mozzarella from Campania, basil and extra virgin olive oil. The pizza napoletana is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (Specialit√† Tradizionale Garantita, STG) product in Europe. Roman pizza, pizza in Lazio (Rome), as well as in many other parts of Italy, is available in two different styles. Take- away shops sell pizza rustica or pizza al taglio. This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1‚Äì2 cm). The pizza is often cooked in an electric oven. It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight. In pizzerias, pizza is served in a dish in its traditional round shape. It has a thin, crisp base quite different from the thicker and softer Neapolitan style base. It is usually cooked in a wood-fired oven, giving the pizza its unique flavor and texture. In Rome, a pizza napoletana is topped with tomato, mozzarella, anchovies and oil (thus, what in Naples is called pizza romana, in Rome is called pizza napoletana). Other types of Lazio-style pizza include: * pizza romana (tomato, mozzarella, anchovies, oregano, oil) * pizza viennese (tomato, mozzarella, German sausage, oregano, oil) * pizza capricciosa (mozzarella, tomato, mushrooms, artichokes, cooked ham, olives, oil) * pizza quattro formaggi (\\"four cheese pizza\\": tomatoes, and the cheeses mozzarella, stracchino, fontina and gorgonzola; sometimes ricotta is swapped for one of the latter three) * pizza bianca (\\"white pizza\\": a type of bread topped with olive oil, salt and, occasionally herbs, such as rosemary sprigs) * it is also a Roman style to add figs to the pizza, the result being known as pizza e fichi and pizza alla casalinga (\\"Housewife pizza\\"): a thin layer of dough which is stretched into an oiled, square \\"Sicilian\\" pan, topped sparingly with shredded mozzarella, crushed uncooked canned tomatoes, chopped garlic and olive oil, and baked until the top bubbles and the bottom is crisp. Pizza quattro stagioni is a popular style prepared with various ingredients in four sections, with each section representing a season of the year. Pizza pugliese is prepared with tomato, mozzarella and onion. Pizzetta is a small pizza that can range in size from around three inches in diameter to the size of a small personal-sized pizza. It may be served as an hors d'oeuvre. Sicilian pizza is prepared in a manner originating in Sicily, Italy. Just in the US, the phrase Sicilian pizza is often synonymous with thick-crust or deep-dish pizza derived from the Sicilian Sfincione. In Sicily, there is a variety of pizza called Sfincione. It is believed that Sicilian pizza, Sfincione, or focaccia with toppings, was popular on the western portion of the island as far back as the 1860s. Pisan pizza (pizza pisana) is a smaller and thicker pizza baked into metal plates and traditionally served with anchovies, capers and grated Grana Padano cheese. The slices are traditionally served folded with a slice of cecina, a chickpeas cake, as street food in Pisa, its province and the nearby provinces of Leghorn and Lucca.  Bill for traditional Italian pizza  There was a bill before the Italian Parliament in 2002 to safeguard the traditional Italian pizza, specifying permissible ingredients and methods of processing (e.g., excluding frozen pizzas). Only pizzas which followed these guidelines could be called \\"traditional Italian pizzas\\" in Italy. On 9 December 2009, the European Union, upon Italian request, granted Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) safeguard to traditional Neapolitan pizza, in particular to \\"Margherita\\" and \\"Marinara\\".EU grants Neapolitan pizza Traditional Specialty Guaranteed label, Pizza Marketplace The European Union enacted a protected designation of origin system in the 1990s. = Malta = The Maltese enjoy eating Italian style pizza and fast-food pizzas, including local produce, however due to the small and limited import market, ingredients tend to be of low quality, for example Sunflower oil typically replaces olive oil. One style of fast-food pizza is the typical pizza kwadra (square pizza), which is found in Pastizzi shops (pastizzeriji), a deep-pan pizza cut into squares, generally topped with either green olives (ta≈º-≈ºebbuƒ°), hard boiled egg and cocktail sausage (bajd u zalzett), or chicken and barbecue sauce (tat-tiƒ°ieƒ°). A typical Pizzerija will offer a vast number of different pizza recipes, mostly based on local taste. A typical menu would include: * Hawaii: tomato sauce, mozzarella, ham, pineapple * Maltija (Maltese): tomato sauce, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, Maltese sausage, onion * Meat Feast: tomato sauce, mozzarella, minced meat, Maltese sausage, and other meat * Mexicana: tomato sauce, mozzarella, various recipes with minced beef, jalape√±os, sweet corn, onion, spicy sauce and other hot ingredients Pizza has become a household dish. Nevertheless, the traditional Maltese pizza consists of a typical Maltese ftira covered in cheese (mainly local gbejna), onions and potatoes. In fact, it is most often known simply as \\"ftira\\" and is mainly sold on the island of Gozo. Different toppings can be added, including tuna, olives, anchovies, sundried tomatoes, and even traditional Maltese sausage. = Norway = Norwegians eat the most pizza in the world according to a 2004 survey by ACNielsen 2004, 5.4 kg/year per capita. 50 million frozen pizzas were sold that year, with consumption being 22,000 tons of frozen pizza, 15,000 tons of home-baked and 13,000 tons of restaurant-made pizzas. By far the most popular is the frozen pizza Grandiosa, every other pizza sold, frozen or fresh, is a Pizza Grandiosa. Since its start in 1980 the Grandiosa has been part of Norwegian modern culture and trends, going so far to be unofficially called \\"The national dish of Norway\\". Norway also has a traditional home-made pizza called \\"l√∏rdagspizza\\" (literally translates to \\"Saturday pizza\\"). The dough is shaped to the pan (usually rectangular), then a mix of minced meat and tomato sauce follows. Finally it is gratinated with a generous amount of cheese. = Sweden = Sweden. Pizza Mexicana with jalape√±o peppers and pineapple is popular in Sweden and Finland. The first pizza to be served in Sweden was in 1947 at the Asea staff canteen in V√§ster√•s but it was not until 1968 that it became available to the general public at the Stockholm restaurant √ñsterg√∂k. Pizzerias soon followed, run at first by Italian guest workers and subsequently by migrant Turks, which added an unmistakable hint of the Levant to the Swedish pizza. Swedish pizzas are thicker than the Neapolitan, with a more spiced sauce, and without the characteristic crisp texture, but make use of the traditional toppings, and most pizzerias in Sweden have Margherita, Capricciosa, and Quattro Stagioni pizzas at the top of the menu, although with altered recipes. For example, a Swedish Margherita uses Swedish hard cheese instead of mozzarella and dried oregano instead of fresh basil. The Swedish pizza has been developed with many innovations and styles, creating a tradition distinct from the Italian one, although some names may overlap. Occasionally pizzerias offer \\"Italian pizza\\" imitating Italian recipes in addition to the Swedish ones. A typical Swedish pizzeria offers 40-50 different named varieties on the menu, even up to 100, and personal modifications are allowed. Also, many pizzerias also serve salads, lasagne, kebab and hamburgers, especially if there is a facility to sit and eat. Italian-style restaurants often combine a restaurant menu with a pizza menu. Some popular varieties common in most of Sweden, mostly with the same name, all having tomato sauce and cheese to start with and additional toppings: * Africana: ham/beef/chicken, banana, pineapple, onion, curry powder * Bolognese: minced meat, onion, (fresh tomato) * Calzone (folded): ham * Capricciosa: mushrooms, ham * Ciao-ciao (folded): beef, garlic, (onion) * Frutti di mare: tuna, shrimp, mussels * Hawaii: ham, pineapple * Kebabpizza: d√∂ner kebab, onion, green peperoncini, (kebab sauce poured over after baking) * Marinara: shrimp, mussels * Mexicana: various recipes with minced beef, jalape√±os, onion, spicy sauce and other spicy ingredients * Napolitana: anchovies, olives, capers * Quattro Stagioni: ham, shrimp, (mussels), mushrooms, artichoke * Vegetariana: mushrooms, onion, (pineapple), (artichokes), (asparagus), (red bell pepper) * other varieties with filet of beef or pork and b√©arnaise sauce and onion Perhaps the most extreme pizza in Sweden is the Calskrove or Calzskrove (a portmanteau of calzone and \\"skrovm√•l\\" meaning \\"big meal\\" but also Northern slang for \\"hamburger meal\\"), sold at some pizzerias in northern Sweden, a complete meal of a 150 or 250 grams of hamburger with bread, all regular toppings, and chips (french fries), baked into a regular Calzone with ham as well. One of the most popular types of pizza in Sweden since the 1990s is kebab-pizza, and a song in the Swedish Melodifestivalen 2008 was \\"Kebabpizza slivovitza\\". The invention is most likely the result of the common tendency of pizza bakers to create their own flagship compositions and novel flavors, using whatever might be available in their kitchen. In recent years one can find pizza with fresh lettuce or chips (French fries) put on top after baking. The amount of topping compared to the crust is rather high by international standards. The typical side order with Swedish pizza is a free \\"pizza salad\\". 1969 Giuseppe \\"Peppino\\" Sperandio opened \\"Pizzeria Piazza Opera\\", one of the first restaurants only serving pizza in Stockholm, Sweden. Sperandio was born in northeast Italy where a cabbage salad called \\"kupus salata\\" was a very common dish, from bordering country Croatia. This salad from his childhood, was offered as a free side dish. Eaten, while waiting for the pizza to be baked. Sperandio became Stockholm's pizza king and had during his heyday more than 30 pizza restaurants. The pizza salad is made with shredded cabbage, coarse pepper and sometimes red bell pepper, slightly pickled (fermented) in vinaigrette for a few days. In general, Swedish pizzerias are private enterprises and not franchise, often owned as a family business by immigrants, but very seldom Italians. Of international restaurant chains only Pizza Hut is well established, although Vapiano has a few restaurants in Stockholm, and Domino's has been trying to establish itself in southern Sweden since 2008. Many pizzerias offer affordable (about 1-2 ‚Ç¨ total, or free with large order) home delivery in less than 30 minutes, and many are connected to an online ordering service. The take-away price of one standard size (30 cm) pizza is 5 to 8 ‚Ç¨ depending on topping, about double that for a \\"family pizza\\" of twice the size by weight, and about half that for a \\"children's pizza\\" (mostly served in restaurants). Pizza has become a staple food in Sweden (1,1 kg/year), although most people prepare their own food, as home cooking skills generally are good, and is largely considered as an acceptable occasional fast food alternative to a proper meal. = United Kingdom = Since the 1980s, a wide variety of pizzas ranging from fairly authentic Italian to American style to the mass- processed varieties are widely available, and pizzas are also commonly made at home with children using local substitutions such as bacon for prosciutto and cheddar for mozzarella. Dough bases vary widely from homemade scone doughs to thin Roman-style and thick American stuffed-crust types. The typical British high-street now has a variety of international Italian- and American-style pizza chains, including homegrown chains PizzaExpress, Strada, and Prezzo as well as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's alongside much more authentic, independent, often Italian-run restaurants with wood-fired ovens, which can be found all over the country. Unique spicy varieties enjoy some popularity, including Chicken tikka masala or other curry toppings, chili pizzas, and a typical mid-range restaurant or takeaway will usually have versions of such standard \\"Italian-American\\" combinations as 'Hawaiian' (ham and pineapple), 'Pepperoni' (spicy salami), 'Meat Feast' (a mix of meats and salami), and 'Vegeteriana' options. Non-Italian varieties can be found too, particularly in larger cities such as London, for example, lahmacun called 'Turkish pizzas', or Alsatian 'Flammkuchen'. In some parts of Scotland you can get a deep-fried pizza from Fish and Chip shops. A frozen pizza, whole or half, is dipped in batter and deep fried, and usually served in the same manner as any other fried item from these shops. =Iceland= While Iceland has many traditional American and Italian style pizza toppings, bananas are a common topping in both Iceland and Sweden. =Russia= Pizza has only been known in Russia since the end of the 20th century. At the turn of the millennium, the first original Italian pizzerias opened in Russia. After that, pizza became a cult phenomenon. In Russia, high-class ingredients are often used as a topping. For example, the pizza is topped with caviar, salmon, beef fillets or truffles. A well-known Russian variant is the so-called '–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞' (pronounced 'Moskva') or Moscow Pizza. It is topped with tomato sauce, cheese, four types of fish fillet, roe, onions and herbs.Different types of Pizza and toppings pizzarecipe.org Retrieved 2019-01-29  Asia  = China = The presence of pizza restaurant chains in China has contributed to a significant increase in pizza consumption in the country. Pizza Hut opened its first store in China in 1990,Smith, A.F. (2012). Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat. Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of what We Love to Eat. ABC-CLIO. p. 121. . Retrieved July 16, 2017. Edwards, William (June 1, 2011). \\"The Pros and Cons of Franchising in China\\". China Business Review. Retrieved July 16, 2017. and Pizza Hut and Domino's Pizza both expanded in the Chinese market in the 2000s. In order to fit with China's market demand and national culinary peculiarities Pizza Hut modified their pizza recipes, including local ingredients, such as crab sticks, tuna, soy sauce and corn. As of 2019, Pizza Hut had over 2,000 stores in China. = India = A Tandoori Paneer pizza from India. Pizza is an emerging fast food in India. Domestic pizza brands include U.S. Pizza, Smokin' Joes and Pizza Corner. Branded pizza is available in most cities in India. Pizza brands feature greater \\"recipe localization\\" from pizza makers than many other markets such as Latin America and Europe, but similar to other Asian pizza markets. Indian pizzas are generally spicier and more vegetable-oriented than those in other countries. For instance, oregano spice packs are included with a typical pizza order in India instead of Parmesan cheese. In addition to spicier and more vegetable-oriented ingredients, Indian pizza also utilized unique toppings. For example, a pizza topping unique to India would be pickled ginger.Thornhill, Jan. Who Wants Pizza?: The Kids' Guide to the History, Science & Culture of Food. Toronto: Maple Tree, 2010. Print. Pizza outlets serve pizzas with several Indian-style toppings, such as tandoori chicken and paneer. More conventional pizzas are also eaten. Pizzas available in India range from localized basic variants, available in neighborhood bakeries, to gourmet pizzas with exotic and imported ingredients available at specialty restaurants. = Indonesia = Balado, an Indonesian fusion cuisine In Indonesia, Pizza Hut is the largest pizza chain restaurant, first entering Indonesia in 1984, followed by Domino's Pizza and Papa Ron's Pizza. Popular pizza recipes such as meat lover's with pepperoni, tuna with melted cheese, and beef blackpepper exist in Indonesia. Those recipes originated either from United States or Italy, thus deriving ultimately from a western counterpart. However, there are also Asian eastern pizzas which includes Indonesian fusion pizza that combine Indonesian favourite as pizza toppings ‚Äî such as satay, balado and rendang. * Balado pizza, spicy hot balado chili pepper pizza, chicken or beef. * Rendang pizza, spicy and savoury beef rendang pizza. * Satay pizza, beef or chicken satay pizza with peanut sauce. Other than Indonesian fusion, other Asian fusion pizza are also known in Indonesia, including: * Tom Yum pizza, Tom Yum flavour pizza from Thailand * Bulgogi pizza, Bulgogi flavor pizza from South Korea * Kimchi pizza, Kimchi flavor pizza from South Korea * Tikka Chicken pizza, Chicken tikka flavour pizza from India * Peking Duck pizza, Peking duck flavour pizza from China * Salmon Teriyaki pizza, Teriyaki flavour pizza from Japan = Japan = American pizza chains entered Japan in the 1970s (e.g. Shakey's Pizza and Pizza Hut 1973, Domino's pizza in 1985). The largest Japanese pizza chain is Pizza-La. Local types of pizza are popular, with many using mayonnaise sauces, and sometimes other ingredients such as corn, potatoes, avocado, eel, or even honey or chocolate (as in dessert). \\"Side orders\\" also often include items such as french fries, fried chicken, and baked pasta, as well as vegetable soups, green salads, desserts, and soda or Japanese tea. There is also a strong tradition of using Tabasco sauce on cooked pizzas. Pizza toppings in Japan also differ from those found in the United States. One of the unique pizza toppings found in Japan is squid. While seafood may be found on pizzas in most markets worldwide to some extent, having squid as the focal ingredient is unique to Japan. Local crust variants also exist, for instance mochi pizza (crust made with Japanese mochi cakes).Ceccarini R. (2010) Food Workers as Individual Agents of Culinary Globalization: Pizza and Pizza Chefs in Japan. Sophia University, Tokyo.Ceccarini R. (2011) Pizza and Pizza Chefs in Japan: A Case of Culinary Globalization. Brill Publishers, Netherlands. Traditional pizza served in Italian-style restaurants are also popular, and the most popular pizza chain promoting Italian style artisanal pizza is Salvatore Cuomo. The Italian association Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana also has an independent branch in Japan. = Korea = Pizza is a popular snack food in South Korea, especially among younger people. Major American brands such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's Pizza compete against domestic brands such as Mr. Pizza and Pizza Etang, offering traditional as well as local varieties which may include toppings such as bulgogi and dak galbi. Korean-style pizza tends to be complicated, and often has nontraditional toppings such as corn, potato wedges, sweet potato, shrimp, or crab. Traditional Italian-style thin-crust pizza is served in the many Italian restaurants in Seoul and other major cities. North Korea's first pizzeria opened in its capital Pyongyang in 2009. = Malaysia = A pizza restaurant at Kulim, Kedah, Malaysia Pizza restaurants in Malaysia include Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Canadian 2 and 1 pizza, Jom Pizza, and Sure Pizza. There have been several small pizza businesses run by locals, especially in night markets. = Nepal = Pizza is becoming more popular as a fast food in the urban areas of Nepal, particularly in the capital city, Kathmandu, which has several restaurants serving pizza. With the opening of international pizza restaurants, pizza's popularity and consumption has markedly increased in recent times. Common pizza types include mushroom pizza, chicken pizza and paneer pizza. = Pakistan = The first pizzerias opened in Karachi and Islamabad in the late 1980s, with Pappasallis serving pizza in Islamabad since 1990. Pizza has gained a measure of popularity in the eastern regions of Pakistan, namely the provinces of Sindh, Punjab, and Azad Kashmir, as well as the autonomous territory of Gilgit- Baltistan. Pizza has not penetrated into western Pakistan; of the remaining provinces and territories of Pakistan, only one (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) has seen much of the dish, in the form of a single Pizza Hut in Peshawar. Chicken Tikka and achari chicken pizzas are popular. In the regions where pizza is known, spicy chicken and sausage-based pizzas are also very popular, as they cater to the local palate. =Thailand= The Pizza Company Thailand introduced durian pizza in 2018 to mixed reviews. It bears mention however that Thai-style pizzas, in homage to Thai cuisine, also appear in the US and elsewhere with peanut-based sauces and ingredients like tofu, bean sprouts, shredded carrots, basil or cilantro, shredded green beans, scallions, and similar items.  Middle East  Pizza with corn and za'atar in Kfar Saba, Israel = Iran = = Israel = Many Israeli and American pizza stores and chains, including Pizza Hut and Sbarro, have both kosher and non-kosher locations. Kosher locations either have no meat or use imitation meat because of the Jewish religious dietary prohibition against mixing meat with dairy products such as cheese. Kosher pizza locations must also close during the holiday of Passover, when no leavened bread is allowed in kosher locations. (However, many have found solutions by offering a potato starch-based dough.) Some Israeli pizza differs from pizza in other countries because of the very large portions of vegetable toppings such as mushrooms or onions, and some unusual toppings, like corn or labane, and middle-Eastern spices, such as za'atar. Like most foods in Israel, pizza choices reflect multiple cultures, since people from the former Soviet Union and Europe, plus Israeli-born descendants and Ashkenazi Jews, account for 50% of the Jews in Israel. = Turkey = Pizza establishments in Turkey are a mixture of local restaurants, local chains (e.g. Pizza Max), and international chains like Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Little Caesars, and Sbarro. While most combinations of toppings reflect common ingredients found in the US and Italy, there are additional ingredients available that cater to traditional tastes as well, such as minced beef, spicy Sucuk sausage, cured meats like Pastƒ±rma, cheeses like Ka≈üar and Beyaz, and local olives and herbs. With the exception of some restaurants, pork products like ham and bacon are not available, which are substituted with beef, chicken, or lamb equivalents. Pizza has several equivalent or similar dishes in traditional Turkish cuisine, such as Black-Sea-style or Bafra-style Pide and Lahmacun, which adds to the popularity of the dish across Turkey.  North America  = United States = New York-style pizza alt= In 1905, the first pizza establishment in the United States was opened in New York's Little Italy. Due to the influx of Italian immigrants, the U.S. has developed regional forms of pizza, some bearing only a casual resemblance to the Italian original. Chicago has its own style of a deep-dish pizza and New York City's style of pizza are well-known. New York-style pizza refers to the thin crust pizza popular in the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Philadelphia provides sauce on top of the cheese; St. Louis and other Midwestern pizzas use thin crusts and rectangular slices in its local pizzas. Detroit-style pizza is a square pizza that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust, and is generally served with the sauce on top of the cheese. The square shape is the result of an early tradition of using metal trays originally meant to hold small parts in factories. The jumbo slice is an oversized New York-style pizza sold by the slice to go, especially in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The white clam pie is a pizza variety that originated at the Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut. Barbecue pizza was first made at Coletta's in Memphis, using pulled pork and barbecue sauce, now popular in the Southern United States. In California the barbecue chicken pizza is popular, first invented by Ed LaDou in 1985.. The BBQ burnt end pizza can be found in Kansas City. = Canada = Nova Scotian Garlic Fingers Canada has many of its own chains, both national and regional, and many distinctive regional variations and types of pizza resulting from influences of local Canadian cuisine. The \\"Canadian pizza\\" toppings typically include tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, bacon, pepperoni, and mushrooms; variations exist); this recipe is also known internationally by that name. The typical preparation of the same recipe is often referred to in Qu√©b√©cois as pizza qu√©b√©coise. Poutine pizza is one variety that can be found sporadically across the country, and adaptations of this item have even been featured in upscale restaurants. Atlantic Canada has several unique varieties, which have spread to other parts of the country as people migrate for work. Donair pizza is inspired by the Halifax fast food of the same name, and is topped with mozzarella cheese, donair meat, tomatoes, onions, and a sweetened condensed milk-based donair sauce. Garlic fingers is an Atlantic Canadian pizza garnished with melted butter, garlic, cheese, and sometimes bacon, with the round sliced into fingers and served with donair sauce. Pictou County Pizza is a variant of pizza unique to Pictou County in Nova Scotia; this pizza has a \\"brown sauce\\" made from vegetables and spices instead of red tomato sauce. The predominantly francophone Canadian province of Quebec has its specialties. One is the \\"all dressed\\": tomato sauce (a little spicy), pepperoni, onions, green pepper slices, and mushrooms. The poutine pizza variety is topped with French fries, light gravy, and fresh mozarella curds. A slice of Hawaiian pizza using pineapple slices According to a number of news outlets, the Hawaiian-style (tomato sauce, ham and pineapple) is a Canadian invention, originating at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario.Sarah DiGregorio, Do Hawaiians Eat Hawaiian Pizza? Plus, a Little History, The Village Voice Last accessed 9 October 2016Drew Halfnight, Canadian man invented Hawaiian pizza, according to wikipedia (and him), National Post Last accessed on July 14, 2010Bob Boughner, Aloha!

By that time Satellite had already started serving Canadian Chinese food and Panopoulos thought people would like a similar sweet and savoury flavours together so he took a can of pineapple and tossed the fruit onto a pizza. Pizza in the southwestern Ontario city of Windsor is identified by its use of shredded pepperoni and mozzarella cheese from the local Galati Cheese Company. Although fresh mushrooms are the norm for most pizza makers in the city, the style was originally known for using canned mushrooms. The distinct qualities of Windsor-area pizza are believed to have originated with the now-closed Volcano Pizza in Windsor's downtown core. As employees of Volcano eventually left and founded their own pizzerias, they took the recipe with them.What makes Windsor pizza Windsor pizza? The Windsor Star Last accessed on March 16, 2018 Pizza-ghetti is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants throughout the province of QuebecPizza-ghetti: a staple item on fast-food menus in Montreal and other parts of Canada.Pizza-ghetti in a family restaurant in Waterloo, Ontario , Waterloo Region Record, 13 December 2006. Retrieved on 11 February 2009 It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. = Mexico = Mexican pizza in Mexico is a pizza made with ingredients typical of Mexican cuisine. The usual toppings that can be found throughout Mexico are chorizo, jalape√±o pepper slices, grilled or fried onions, tomato, chili pepper, shrimp, avocado, and sometimes beef, bell peppers, tripas or scallops. This pizza has the usual marinara sauce or white sauce and mozzarella cheese. Variations, substituting pepper jack cheese or Oaxaca cheese for mozzarella, are also popular. There is also a Tex-Mex dish served with 2 layers of tortillas called \\"Mexican pizza\\". It's dissimilar to a pizza. Instead, it more closely resembles a double decker, open faced tostada. It's relatively unknown in Mexico, but can be found in some Tex-Mex restaurants in the USA, notably Taco Bell  Oceania  = Australia = The usual Italian varieties are available, though more common is the style popular in the U.S., with more and richer toppings than Italian style. A common unique type is the Aussie, Australian or Australiana, which has the usual tomato base or a seasoned base and mozzarella cheese with options of chicken, ham, bacon and egg (seen as quintessentially Australian breakfast fare). Pizzas with seafood such as prawns are also popular. In the 1980s some Australian pizza shops and restaurants began selling \\"gourmet pizzas\\", that is, pizzas with more expensive ingredients such as mangoes, salmon, dill, bocconcini, tiger prawns, or unconventional toppings such as kangaroo meat, emu and crocodile. \\"Wood-fired pizzas\\", that is, those cooked in a ceramic oven heated by wood fuel, are well-regarded. Franchised pizza chains coexist with independent pizzerias. Middle-Eastern bakeries and kebabs shops often sell pizza, which is often done in a Lebanese or Turkish style. In Australia, barbecue sauce and traditional tomato sauce are both common and popular sauces for pizza bases. White pizza (i.e.: without sauce) is not common. = New Zealand = The usual Italian varieties are available and independent restaurants are common, coexisting with franchise chains. New Zealand's first dedicated pizza franchise was opened by Pizza Hut in New Lynn in 1974, with Domino's following. One notable indigenous chain is Hell Pizza established in 1996 - which now has outlets worldwide - distinguishing itself by often-controversial marketing and using only free-range ingredients. Furthermore, Middle-Eastern bakeries and kebabs shops often sell pizza, which is often done in Turkish style. New Zealand has no rules for pizza construction, leading to an eclectic and varied approach to toppings. Gourmet and \\"wild\\" ingredients are often used, and New Zealanders are apt to push the boundaries of what a pizza can be. In 2017, spaghetti pizza gained media attention when then Prime Minister of New Zealand Bill English posted a recipe to his Facebook account that included tinned spaghetti. The recipe included pineapple as a topping. Responses on social media included support for spaghetti pizza as a simple and cheap family meal. In 2019 Domino's Pizza included a \\"Hawaiian Spaghetti Pizza\\" on the menu on its franchises in New Zealand.  South America  = Argentina = Argentine fugazzeta Argentina, and more specifically Buenos Aires, received a massive Italian migration. At the turn of the 19th century, immigrants from Naples and Genoa opened the first pizza bars, though Spanish residents subsequently owned most of the pizza businesses. Standard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust, \\"media masa\\" (half dough), than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Argentine gastronomy tradition, served pizza with fain√°, which is a Genovesi chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza, and moscato wine. The most popular variety of pizza is called \\"muzzarela\\" (mozzarella), similar to Neapolitan pizza (bread, tomato sauce and cheese), but made with a thicker \\"media masa\\" crust, triple cheese and tomato sauce, usually also with olives. It can be found on nearly every corner of the country; Buenos Aires is considered the city with the most pizza bars by person in the world. Other popular toppings include ham (with or without slices of red bell peppers in oil preserve), tomato slices, red bell peppers in preserve, and longaniza. Two Argentine born varieties of pizza, also very popular: fugazza with cheese and fugazzeta. The former one consists in a regular pizza crust topped with cheese and onions; the latter has the cheese between two pizza crusts, with onions on top. In Argentina, a pizza a la napolitana (\\"Neapolitan pizza\\") is a pizza topped with mozzarella cheese and slices of fresh tomato, which may also be flavoured with garlic. = Brazil = Chocolate pizza served as a dessert at a restaurant in Brazil S√£o Paulo has 6,000 pizza establishments and 1.4 million pizzas are consumed daily. It is said that the first Brazilian pizzas were baked in the Br√°s district of S√£o Paulo in the late part of the 19th century. Until the 1940s, pizza was almost only found in the Italian communities around the country. Since then, pizza became increasingly popular among the rest of the population. The most traditional pizzerias are still found in the Italian neighborhoods, such as Bexiga (official name: Bela Vista). Both Neapolitan (thick crust) and Roman (thin crust) varieties are common in Brazil, with traditional versions using tomato sauce and mozzarella as a base. Brazilian pizza in general, though, tends to have less tomato sauce than the authentic (Italian) pizza, or uses slices of tomato in place of sauce. Brazilian pizzerias offer also Brazilian variants such as \\"pizza com catupiry\\". July 10 is \\"Pizza Day\\" in S√£o Paulo, marking the final day of an annual competition among \\"pizzaiolos\\". In Brazil, pizza quatro queijos (pizza quattro formaggi) uses mozzarella, provolone, parmesan and gorgonzola, and there is also a variety with five cheeses, which adds Catupiry brand soft cheese. = Colombia = \\"Hawaiian pizza\\" is popular in Colombia. This pizza is topped with ham and pineapple.

This system is also used in the National Republican Guard (GNR, Guarda Nacional Republicana), a gendarmerie force that can be put under the command of the Armed Forces in case of war. The second system is used by the Portuguese Navy (Marinha), consisting of traditional naval ranks. In the Armed Forces of Portugal, the hierarchy of ranks divides them in three large categories: Officers (oficiais), Sergeants (sargentos) and Enlisted (pra√ßas).

Life Born in Salzburg, Salome was the daughter of the merchant and city councillor Wilhelm Alt and a granddaughter of Ludwig Alt, former mayor of Salzburg.Heinz Dopsch; Robert Hoffmann: Salzburg. Die Geschichte einer Stadt (2. Auflage). Universit√§tsverlag Anton Pustet, Salzburg: 2008, . Contemporary sources describe her as a tall grown woman and belle of the city. She met the Archbishop at a festivity, whereafter Raitenau took her to his Salzburg residence. While her parents forbade her to ever enter their home again, she was installed officially as the archbishop's common law spouse. The couple's first known child was born in 1593; in total, the partnership produced fifteen sons and daughters. Raitenau, mediated by his uncle Cardinal Mark Sittich von Hohenems Altemps, worked incessantly but ultimately in vain to obtain a papal dispensation to marry her. At last, upon a visit by Emperor Rudolf II in 1609, their children were officially relieved from their status as illegitimate. Raitenau vested Salome with the noble title von Altenau and in 1606 had a shared retreat for them erected outside the Salzburg city walls, which later was rebuilt as Mirabell Palace by his nephew and successor Mark Sittich von Hohenems. A reflective and friendly balanced character, Salome was a haven of peace for her partner stuck in increasing internal and external conflicts. Despite her position as the archbishop's mistress, she was said to have no enemies at the Salzburg court throughout her life. In 1611 Raitenau, deserted by his cathedral chapter and abandoned by Emperor Rudolf II, had to flee from the Salzburg court, after he entered into a fierce dispute with his mighty neighbour, Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria, and Bavarian forces invaded the archiepiscopal estates. On his flight he was captured, deposed and imprisoned for life by his successor, Mark Sittich von Hohenems. Salome likewise was arrested, but released soon after and retired to Wels in Austria. Though they were able to secretly communicate, the couple never met again. After Raiteneau's death in custody in 1617, she dressed in mourning like a widow for the rest of her life.

Production The film was shot in the basement of the Macello's Castle and in Turin. The film includes cultural references from Shakespeare, the Sufis (all of Ibn Arabi), and including Luigi Valli, Gabriele Rossetti, Ren√© Gu√©non, Miguel As√≠n Palacios, and also religious origins of literature, reaching from Muslim, Jewish, and Indian traditions back to the Epic of Gilgamesh. Inspired by the work of Gustave Dor√©, the animations are set to express the esoteric world with respect. Plot The film investigates the life and philosophy of Dante Alighieri through a series of interviews with intellectuals, artists, masons and men of faith who guide the viewer in discovering a little-known side of the man considered the father of the Italian language. This includes analysis of the cardinal points of The Divine Comedy and references to the Western tradition of initiation, secret lodges, membership or not, which accompany the viewer in a different approach to the study of Dante Alighieri.

The name also gives a clue to the origins of the company in the, ultimately successful, opposition to Reading's proposed Cross- Town Route, a road scheme that would have seriously impacted the point at which the two rivers meet. To date, the company has published over 70 titles. A significant part of its work explores and celebrates local history. It also publishes new editions of classic poems, especially ones with some Reading connection, such as Oscar Wilde's The Ballad of Reading Gaol, and collections of contemporary poetry from resident poets.

Success Parking considered the acquisition of parking lots and facilities in the United States with a value of hundreds of millions of dollars and submitted a proposal for the acquisition of the public company \\"Azorim\\" with the intention of using its many plots as parking lots and investing, through \\"Azorim\\", in the purchase of parking lots and facilities in the United States. In 2008, Tsahi Merkur, through Success Parking, purchased from the billionaire businessman, Yitzhak Tshuva, a portfolio of nine parking lots in Tel Aviv, Netanya, Petach Tikva and Jerusalem with some 2000 parking spaces. The deal was worth some 40 million NIS. Since its establishment, Success Parking has managed hundreds of parking lots and today holds some 100 parking lots and facilities across Israel. Success Parking operates all types of parking structures and lots including open lots, single and multi-story both with and without parking equipment and robotic parking system, daytime and nighttime parking, private and municipal parking, airport parking facilities, parking at commercial centers as well as office building, residential complexes and more. The company uses in many of its parking lots, technological innovations developed by the company itself. Some of the parking lots are operated by Success Parking for some of Israel's largest holding companies as well as renting parking facilities from business people on a temporary basis until the construction of office buildings, commercial centers, hotels, etc. The total value of temporary plots held by Success Parking until project construction starts is estimated at tens of billions of shekels.

Agn√®s-Fran√ßoise Lelouchier was the issue of Jean Fran√ßois Le Louchier, Seigneur de Popuelles and Charlotte d' Aubermont and a member of the Flemish nobility. She became the lover of Maximilian II Emanuel when he was the governor of the Spanish Netherlands.

After the wedding, they returned to Brussels. She had a son with Maximilian, named Emanuel-Fran√ßois-Joseph (1695-1747), who was later legitimized by his father. In 1700, the electress wished to separate from the elector because of this affair, but managed to reconcile. The same year, the elector and electress returned to Bavaria. Le Louchier was given an assignment as a spy by the elector and sent to Paris to make use of political connections in favour of Bavarian interests. She succeeded with her task and was rewarded with a life pension. She lived with Maximilian during his exile from 1704 to 1715 until he met his wife again on 8 April 1715.

Both nations are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations.  History  During Spanish colonization of Mexico from 1519 to 1810, any relations between New Spain and the Commonwealth of Poland would have been via Spain. After some time, while Mexico was obtaining its independence from Spain, Poland, by contrast, was finding itself being invaded and split among the Kingdom of Prussia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire. At the end of World War I and after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, Poland obtained its independence once more. In September 1921, Mexican President Alvaro Obregon recognized the national sovereignty of Poland. That same year, Polish Prince Albert Radziwill, who was head of the Polish Legation in Washington, D.C., United States, met with Mexican diplomats in the city, thus establishing the first official contact between the two nations.Beyond Politics: Cultural Connections Among Mexico, Romania and Poland However, it was not until 26 February 1928 that diplomatic relations between the two countries were formally established. In 1930, Mexico and Poland signed a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation and Mexico soon opened its first diplomatic legation in Warsaw.History of diplomatic relations between Mexico and Poland (in Spanish) Orphaned Polish children in Santa Rosa, Guanajuato In the 1930s, diplomatic relations between the two nations became difficult with the rise of Adolf Hitler in neighboring Germany to the west of Poland and the ever-expanding Soviet Union to the east. In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty stating that they would not attack one another if a war broke out in Europe and that they would share between them the territory of Poland. This treaty was to be known as the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. During World War II, diplomatic relations between Mexico and Poland never ceased. Mexico vehemently condemned the invasion and occupation of Poland by both German and Soviet troops. In May 1942, Mexico declared war on Germany and on December 1942, Polish Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski paid an official visit to Mexico and met with Mexican President Manuel √Åvila Camacho.Relations between Mexico and Poland (in Spanish) To show solidarity with the Polish people, Mexico accepted in 1943 over 2,000 Polish refugees including 1,400 Polish orphans to settle in the state of Guanajuato in central Mexico. After the war, many of the refugees remained to live in Mexico.Hacienda Santa Rosa: a Polish Refuge in Mexico At the end of World War II, Mexico continued to maintain diplomatic relations with communist Poland.

That same year, Polish Prime Minister J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz paid an official visit to Mexico. Diplomatic relations continued unabated even when Poland transitioned from having a communist government to a democratic one in 1989.

He held the position of professional chief-of-staff of the Moroccan army between 13 June 2014 and January 2017. On 13 June 2014 Arroub was appointed by king Mohammed VI into this position after the sudden death of General Abdelaziz Bennani. In June 2014, reports had revealed that Bennani was in poor health and that he was following treatment in France. Arroub was also the commander of the military intelligence service (the third bureau), a position he held for a long time since the days of Hassan II (1988), after he was brought back by the monarch into important positions, since he was a member of Oufkir's cabinet as a junior officer at the time of the attempted coups of 1972 and 1971. Life Few details are known about Arroub. He is part of the older generation of Moroccan officers and was the chief of cabinet of Mohamed Oufkir. As early as 1966 he held the rank of captain and was in command of the Benguerir military base. A Leaked US diplomatic cable from 2008, described Arroub as \\"historically pro-French, appears to have become increasingly pro-U.S. in the last 5 years\\". The same cable also predicted that Arroub may succeed Bennani. General Arroub was once retired but was recalled in 2008. Role in the 1971 coup attempt According to Prince Moulay Hicham, Arroub may have participated in the 1971 coup. In his 2014 book, Journal D'un Prince Banni, the prince reports that Arroub was at the time a member of Oufkir's cabinet, and while the shooting was happening he was reached by Lamia Solh (wife of Prince Moulay Abdallah, and mother of Prince Hicham) to inquire about the situation, and she stated that he was very impolite with her. After the failure of the coup, Hassan II was informed of the incident by Lamia Solh, the king then replied \\"You mean that he was part of the plotters? If that is the case, I have to execute everybody then\\". The prince goes on to say that the professionalism and integrity of Arroub, might have made the man come to the conclusion that the future of the country was better without the monarchy. Arroub would be excluded from any position of responsibility for the following twenty years or so, before Hassan II appointed him as chief of the third bureau in 1988. The death of Hassan II and arrest of Basri On the day of the death of Hassan II, Arroub and general Housni Benslimane reportedly had Driss Basri, then minister of the interior, briefly detained and questioned. Prince Hicham questioned Arroub about the incident to which he replied that it was done as a precautionary measure. Family Bouchaib Arroub is the father of Mohammed Ramses Arroub, an engineer and laureate of the √âcole Polytechnique, who was the CEO of Wafa Assurance, the insurance company owned by king Mohammed VI as part of his large holding company SNI. On 4 June 2014, a few days before the appointment of his father as the new Inspector General, Mohamed Ramses Arroub was excluded from this position by the board of the insurance company, which cited \\"personal reasons\\" for this decision.

Headliners in 2014 include Tricky, Morcheeba, Bellowhead, Levellers, and The Human League.\\"Galtres Parklands Festival Headliners Revealed\\". Founded in 2005 originally as a real ale and music festival in Crayke, North Yorkshire, Galtres Parklands Festival increased in attendance capacity to 10,000 and grew to incorporate an entertainment programme on eight stages featuring dance, theatre, family entertainment, spoken word and music, with the music programme combining local and regional talent with international artists. Galtres Parklands Festival has featured headline performances from acts including The Stranglers, Max√Ømo Park, Adam Ant, The Charlatans, Buzzcocks, Ash, Billy Bragg, Lloyd Cole, British Sea Power and The Undertones. Galtres Parklands Festival was owned by The Galtres Festival Charitable Foundation, registered by the Charity Commission for England and Wales and was run under licence by Crucial Events Promotion.\\"Crucial Events\\"  History  = 2005-2009: Founding and expansion of programming = The event now known as Galtres Parklands Festival originated in 2005 as 'The Crayke Village Real Ale Festival'. Re-branded in 2006 as 'The Galtres Festival' - a reference to the festival site's location within the boundaries of the historical Forest of Galtres - the event grew in scale steadily from 2006 to 2009, building the music, food, dance and family entertainment programmes. Throughout this period the annual festival took place at progressively larger sites in Huby, Sutton-on-the-Forest and Crayke. = 2010-2012: Increase in attendance and higher profile performers = Galtres Festival moved to a 5,000-person capacity site in Crayke in 2010. This period in the festival's history saw the booking of higher profile performers including The Lightning Seeds, Dodgy and The Beat; and a rebrand of marketing materials by design agency Lazenby Brown.\\"Galtres Festival\\" This stage of growth saw the event progress from being a regional event to one with national profile. The York ArtsBarge Project teamed up with Galtres in 2010, adding a new vein of underground music and cabaret to the programme which to many became central to the whole event. =2013-2015: 'Galtres Parklands Festival' rebrand and bankruptcy= In 2013, the festival moved to a new 10,000-person capacity site in the grounds of Duncombe Park, an historic country estate near Helmsley, North Yorkshire, overlooking the North York Moors National Park. The move was accompanied with a re-brand from 'Galtres Festival' to 'Galtres Parklands Festival'. Performers booked to perform at Galtres Parklands Festival 2014 included Tricky, Morcheeba, Bellowhead, Levellers and The Human League. The 2014 festival lost money and a new cashless payment system left traders owed up to ¬£120,000 by festival organisers. The festival company went into administration in September 2014 and a 2015 relaunch was also cancelled. Ethos Galtres Parklands Festival is widely regarded as a genuinely family- friendly event, and features an extensive programme of interactive 'family' activities. In both the procurement of food and drink, and the booking of non- profile performers for the event, the organisers positively discriminate in favour of local suppliers and performers. and the event's environmental concerns include an urban tree planting programme funded by ticket purchasers in partnership with Treemendous York. Reviews The Festival has been nominated for several UK Festival Awards. The Guardian writer Simon Godley wrote of the 2012 festival: \\"Despite its emphasis upon being all things local it manages to maintain a wider global perspective without lapsing into parochialism. It is an end result which is achieved by a collective vision, detailed planning and organisation and nigh on perfect execution.\\" The Festivals for All website described Galtres as \\"a splendid festival and up there as one of the best events of its size in the UK. ... a true celebration of talent, imagination, creativity and professionalism.\\" References  * External links * Galtres Parklands Festival website * The Galtres Festival Charitable Foundation website Category:Festivals in North Yorkshire ","title":"Galtres Parklands Festival"},{"id":"43044493","text":"The Blake and Amory Building is a historic commercial building at the corner of Temple Place and Washington Street in Downtown Crossing, historically the main shopping district of Boston, Massachusetts.

It was established in 1999 based on recommendations by the President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry. NQF‚Äôs membership comprises over 400 organizations, representing consumers, health plans, medical professionals, employers, government and other public health agencies, pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and other quality improvement organizations. NQF has helped develop guidelines on palliative care. Some researchers have discussed difficulties in following NQF proposals. Consensus-based entity NQF operates as a consensus-based entity in the creation of voluntary consensus standards as defined by the National Technology Transfer Act and Advancement act of 1995 and the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119, which directs US government agencies to participate in the development and use of voluntary consensus standards. These consensus standards are largely concerned with measuring and publicly reporting on performance in healthcare settings. NQF uses a multi-step consensus development process to vet performance measures created by public and private measure developers including the NCQA, CMS, and Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI). NQF endorses those measures that meet the following criteria: * Importance to measure and report * Scientific acceptability of measure properties * Feasibility * Usability and use * Related and competing measures The endorsement process has historically taken 12 months to complete, but NQF streamlined its process in 2014, reducing the process to seven months. NQF-endorsed measures are preferred for use in federal programs like PCPI. Programs NQF, under contract to the federal government, played a significant role in the creation of the national quality strategy. Under contract to the federal government, NQF convenes a consensus body to recommend measures for specific federal programs via the Measures Application Partnership. NQF is best known for its report on Serious Reportable Events (SREs or never events) in 2009. NQF created the term to refer to 28 preventable, serious, and unambiguous adverse events that should never occur in a healthcare setting. A 2006 report published in the American Journal of Medical Quality reviewed \\"facilitators and barriers\\" to implementing the National Quality Forum's recommended hospital practices. It identified executive support, administrative support and education and training as key factors, while \\"resistance to change\\" was the most difficult barrier to overcome. Controversies On January 9, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice and 49 U.S States and the District of Columbia reached an out-of- court settlement with CareFusion, a medical products company, for US$40 million in a whistleblower suit that alleged that the company had paid Charles Denham over US$11 million to influence medical standards settings in favor of the company while he was involved with NQF. In a press release, NQF distanced itself from Dr. Denham and his foundation TMIT while stating \\"reference to [the CareFusion product] was removed from the draft Safe Practices report after an NQF ad hoc review did not find sufficient evidence to support one skin preparation over another.\\" References External links * Category:1999 establishments in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in Washington, D.C.

He appeared in numerous films during the Golden Age of Hollywood from the late 1920s to late 1940s. Biography Born in New York City in 1894, the white-haired, burly actor was often typecast as an earnest police officer, newspaper editor or principal. He appeared in over 250 films between 1928 and 1948, mostly playing small supporting roles with a few sentences. Charles Wilson began his acting career at the theatre, including roles in six Broadway plays between 1918 and 1931. In 1928, he directed the Hollywood comedy Lucky Boy (1928), where he also made his film debut. According to the Internet Movie Database, Lucky Boy was Wilson's only film as a director. His most notable role was probably Clark Gable's \\"wonderfully aggravated\\" newspaper boss in Frank Capra's comedy It Happened One Night, which won five Academy Awards in 1935. He was also cast in small roles in other Capra movies such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). Shortly before his death, Wilson appeared as the boss of the Three Stooges in the two-reel comedy Crime on Their Hands (1948). He died at the age of 53 of esophageal varices.

For some time he was one of the more fashionable painters of portraits of the new ruling class in France. His more mature paintings, done after his return to Italy, were also well regarded. Early years copy of David's The Death of Marat Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli was born in Rome in 1768. He trained as a painter at the Accademia Ambrosiana in Milan, during the period of political turmoil before the French Revolution. He made a visit to Rome before returning to Milan. In 1790 he crossed the Alps to France, where he found a vibrant artistic scene enhanced by the political situation and the rediscovery of classical art, and in which foreigners were welcome. He soon became known, and on 31 December 1790 was invited to participate by the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Paris By 1793 Serangeli was working in the studio of Jacques- Louis David as both a student and a friend of the master. At this time he made a copy of David's painting of The Death of Marat, one of the most famous images of the Revolution. Fran√ßois G√©rard, who was also working in the studio at the time and was exempt from military service since he was a member of a revolutionary tribunal, made another copy of the same painting. A 1795 painting of a portrait of the children of Seriziat was probably made in 1795 during a visit Serangeli made to David, who had retired to the farm of Saint- Ouen at Favi√®res, Seine-et-Marne. In 1801 David commissioned Serangeli and other artists to illustrate Jean Racine's Mithridate, probably among the last work he received from David. Serangeli exhibited at the Salon of the Louvre from 1793 onward. He presented a Flight into Egypt in 1794, which was purchased by Gaudefroy and then sold to Vauthier. In 1795 he presented Roman Charity, considered by the critics to be inspired by Guido Reni. This work was highly praised for its skillful treatment of lighting. In 1796 he presented Orpheus pleading, now at the Museum of Music. This work confirmed his artistic status and began to arouse jealousy from other artists. He obtained his second official award at this time with his Death of Eurydice. He continued to exhibit at the Salon every year until 1814, when he presented his most important work, Pirro after killing Priam takes Polixene to sacrifice at the tomb of Achilles. Portrait of a young Woman (1807-10) Serangeli became a leading portrait painter for the new ruling class of the empire. His 1899 portrait of Germaine Faipoult de Maisoncelle and her daughter Julie, the wife and daughter of Guillaume-Charles Faipoult de Maisoncelle, is an example of his work in this period. His Portrait of a young Woman, now in the Ashmolean Museum of the University of Oxford, probably dates from 1807-10. Although the subject is unknown, the fashionably and expensively dressed young woman was probably painted for her future or present husband. At least eight of Serangeli's private portraits were exhibited at the Salon. He also painted mythological and religious subjects. Serangeli opened a studio in Paris in 1805, and taught some well-known students such as Claudio Linati, who was also a lithographer. His pupil Jean-Baptiste Vinchon won the second Prix de Rome for painting in 1813 and the first Prix de Rome in 1814. In 1807 Napoleon's Minister of Arts, Denon, commissioned Serangeli to paint events in the career of Napoleon, starting with Napoleon receiving the deputies of the army, which was exhibited in the Salon of 1808. The painting was used as the design for a tapestry. In 1808 he created Napoleon and Alexander I after the Peace of Tilsit, now at Versailles. The painting gives a somewhat romantic view of the historical event where the Treaties of Tilsit were signed, which was itself staged rather theatrically. Later years Farewell of Napol√©on and Alexandre after the Peace of Tilsit In December 1817 Serengeli was named correspondant to the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts, and sent his thanks from Milan. After his return to Italy he made frescos from the legend of Cupid and Psyche to decorate the Villa Sommariva on Lake Como. He eventually settled in Milan, and became Professor to the Academy of Fine Arts of Milan. Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli died in Turin on 12 January 1852. Only a few dozen known works have survived.

History The Agnew Lake Mine was owned and operated by Kerr Addison Mines Ltd, the mine began producing uranium in 1977, utilizing both underground and surface mining techniques. Agnew Lake was the first biohydrometallurgy mining operation. Underground mining was done via sublevel stoping, with oversize rock skipped to surface via a shaft, bioleaching was carried out both underground and on surface stockpiles to produce Triuranium octoxide (U3O8). By the end of 1980 underground mining stopped, and by 1983 the mine closed. The Agnew Lake mine site was decommissioned, buildings removed, and the shaft capped. Monitoring of the site was carried out by Kerr Addison between 1983 and 1988, with the property being turned over to the Ontario government in the early 1990s. Geology The uranium mineralization at Agnew Lake is contained within a pyritic quartz-pebble conglomerate that unconformably overlies granitic rocks. This is similar to the style of mineralization found in the Elliot Lake uranium camp.

He ran for re-election in the 2018 provincial election and was defeated soundly, coming in 3rd in the riding of Newmarket-Aurora with less than 23% of the vote.

Early life Trashi was born on 19 May 1992 in Gramsh, Elbasan, Albania. Trashi is since his childhood Fan of Partizani Tirana. Club career =Gramshi= Trashi began his career with his local team KF Gramshi, where he was promoted to the senior side in 2008 while the club was in the Albanian Second Division. During the season Gramshi won the northern division and reached the championship final, which they lost to KF MemaliajAlbania 2009‚Äì09 The following season his side were promoted and he played in the Albanian First Division, where he featured in 19 league games and scored his first senior goal, helping his side avoid relegation and finish comfortably in 10th place.Albania 2009‚Äì10 In his second season in the First Division he again helped his side avoid relegation, this time narrowly on goal difference, and he featured in 20 league games without scoring a goal.Albania 2010‚Äì11 During the 2011‚Äì12 season he played 25 league games and scored 2 goals, which helped his side finish in a respectable 8th place out of 16 teams.Albania 2011‚Äì12 The following season, however, Gramshi struggled despite Trashi's good individual performances throughout the campaign. In February 2013 he was awarded with the 'Pride of the City' title by the Gramsh municipality on their 53rd anniversary for his contribution to the city's football team. He was hit by controversy in April 2013 when he fell out with his head coach Edmond Hida and was expelled from the squad due to what he described as Trashi's unsporting behaviour. However, he was eventually invited back into the squad in order to help them in their relegation struggle. He ended the 2012‚Äì13 campaign with 5 goals in 25 league games, but his side were eventually relegated after finishing in penultimate place.Albania 2012-13 =KF Lushnja= Following Gramshi's relegation from the Albanian First Division, Trashi was allowed to leave the club and sign for another team, and he eventually signed for newly promoted Albanian Superliga side KS Lushnja prior to the 2013‚Äì14 campaign. He scored the only goal on his Albanian Superliga debut against FK Kuk√´si and was named the man of the match. His goal came in the 54th minute from an assist by Gentian √áela, which Trashi converted into the net with a volley on his left foot. He quickly established himself as a first team regular, playing on both sides of the midfield and developing an effective relationship with Erlind Koreshi on the opposite flank and with the striker Mikel Canka. His next goal came in a memorable 2‚Äì0 win over Partizani Tirana, where he opened the scoring with an individual effort after picking up the ball from the centre circle and beating Partizani's defenders to then beat the keeper with a powerful left footed strike into the top left corner. Lushnja continued to struggle in the league despite Trashi's and Canka's impressive performances, both of whom linked up well to create the opening goal in an away game against Flamurtari Vlor√´ on 10 November, where Trashi again took the lead in the 51st minute but his side still fell to a 4‚Äì3 defeat. By the January transfer window he was considered the discovery of the season in Albanian football, and had attracted attention from bigger clubs due to his good form and 4 league goals in the first half of the season. He was offered a move to FK Kuk√´si, which he subsequently turned down in favour of remaining with Lushnja, a decision not shared by his midfield partner Erlind Koreshi, who opted for a mid season move to KF Tirana. In a crucial relegation battle scrap against Bylis Ballsh on 22 February, Trashi scored his 5th league goal of the season from a free kick to open the scoring after 13 minutes in the 2‚Äì0 win. He scored once again in the next league game against Besa Kavaj√´ in the 83rd minute to equalise, beating the keeper from a powerful free kick again.Besa del huq, kapiteni Hoxha humb penallti.

His individual performances throughout the season were noticed and he was featured in the Albanian Superliga Team of the Year, as well as being nominated for Talent of the Year, an award for the best young players in the Albanian Superliga. =Partizani Tirana= Following KF Lushnja's relegation from the Albanian Superliga, Trashi signed a three-year contract with Partizani Tirana on 31 May 2014. On 9 November 2015, he extended his contract for another three seasons, kepping him at the club until 2018. =Qadsia= On 21 June 2020, Partizani Tirana through a communiqu√© stated that Trashi from next season is part of Kuwait Premier League club Qadsia. International career Trashi was first involved internationally when he was invited by Albania U21s coach Sk√´nder Gega to a three-day trial in February 2013 while he was playing for KF Gramshi. He came on as a second-half substitute in the unofficial friendly against Kosovar Superliga side KF Drenica at the end of the trial, which Albania U21s lost 2‚Äì0.

The wine barrel has a diameter of 13.5 metres, a volume of about 1,700,000 litres or 1,700 m¬≥ and is thus the largest cask in the world.Die Fassgeschichte at www.duerkheimer-fass.de. Retrieved 13 Jun 2014 However, it is not used for the storage of wine, but houses a restaurant.  Location  The Giant Cask on St.-Michaels-Allee 1 is northeast of the old town in the water meadows of the Isenach stream on the western edge of the 45,000 m¬≤ Br√ºhlwiesen meadows. Every year on the second and third week in September the D√ºrkheim Wurstmarkt (lit.: \\"sausage market\\") takes place on these fields. The Wurstmarkt is the biggest wine festival in the world, playing host to over 600,000 visitors. Access to the Weinfass and the Wurstmarkt is from the B 37 federal highway (Ludwigshafen am Rhein‚ÄìKaiserslautern) just to the north.  History  The barrel was built in 1934 by Bad D√ºrkheim vineyard owner and master cooper, Fritz Keller, using wood to fashion it into the standard shape using traditional methods, albeit oversized. To construct the cask nearly 200 spruce trees were felled in the Northern Black Forest, all about 40 metres high. One tree was needed for each of the 178 staves, each 15 metres long and 15 cm thick. In all, more than 200 m¬≥ of wood was used. The timber was supplied by the Krauth & Co. Sawmill in Rotenbach in the Enztal valley.Telephone enquiry to the sawmill by German wikipedia editor, Chronist 47. With the completion of the Giant Cask in D√ºrkheim, it superseded by a long way the famous Heidelberg Tun which, with a length of 9 metres, a diameter of 7 metres and capacity of 221,726 litres, and was actually used to store wine, had previously been the largest cask in the world.  Description  The giant D√ºrkheim barrel bears the inscription D√ºrkheimer Riesenfa√ü in the old German script on the bottom of the barrel which faces east. The interior is a type of wine bar. It can take just under 430 guests on two levels (ground floor and gallery). Because of the number of visitors, in 1958 the wooden \\"tub\\" (B√ºtt) was added. This is an oversized tub, constructed in the same style as the Riesenfass and has space for about 120 guests. The bar is operated for most of the year in the B√ºtt; the barrel itself is only accessible to guests during the Wurstmarkt and for large groups by prior arrangement.

The area is bounded to the west by the cliff edge, in the east by County Road 149, and in the south by the town of Visby. Galgberget is named after the still remaining gallows, built during the 13th century, where local criminals used to be executed. It is claimed to be the only preserved Medieval execution site in Europe. The gallows consist of a low, circular stone wall with three pillars of stone rising from it. Wooden beams rested on the pillars, and criminals were hung from these using ropes and hooks. It is believed that the gallows were in use until 1845. The gallows were situated so that there was a clear view of them in Visby and from the sea, so that everyone could view those who had been executed. In July 2008, in close proximity to the gallows, archaeologists from the Gotland Museum found the bones of some 30 people who had been executed, presumably on the spot. The area has barren vegetation due to its limestone constitution, the most common plant being Prunus spinosa, commonly called the blackthorn or sloe. It is a popular hiking area. Galgberget also has the ruin of a lime kiln and a disused motor stadium. , there are also a number of recently built apartment houses. During the Medieval Week reenactment of the Battle of Visby in 2008, the local branch of the Society for Creative Anachronism organized a medieval tent camp at Galgberget.

Examples were recorded at Saliceto di Cravagliana in the province of Vercelli in 1983, and others have since been identified in the province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, particularly in the Val Divedro and the upper Ossola.

The breed is not recognised in Switzerland; the Swiss ProSpecieRara foundation registered all identifiable members of the breed in Switzerland and in Germany in 2013. In Italy the Sempione is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the national association of sheep- and goat- breeders.

She was the only daughter of Chaopha Sutamla, king of Ahom kingdom and his wife Pakhori Gabharu, the daughter of Momai Tamuli Borbarua. She was the niece of Lachit Borphukan and Laluksola Borphukan. She famously resisted Laluksola Borphukan's plan to hand over Guwahati to her husband. Early life Ramani Gabharu was born as Ahom princess, and was the only daughter of Swargadeo Jayadhwaj Singha, king of Ahom Dynasty and his wife Pakhori Gabharu, the Tamuli Kuwari. Her real name was Ramani Gabharu, and was also known as Nangchen Gabharu and Maina Gabharu. She was the maternal granddaughter of Momai Tamuli Borbarua, was an able administrator and the commander-in-chief of the army in the Ahom kingdom, and the niece of Lachit Borphukan and Laluksola Borphukan, who are known for their participation in the Battle of Saraighat that thwarted a drawn-out attempt by Mughal forces under the command of Ram Singh I to take back Kamrup. Marriage When Mir Jumla invaded Jayadhwaj's kingdom and defeated him in the war, he made a truce with Mir Jumla on a condition for which his daughter Ramani Gabharu had to be sent to the Mughal's imperial harem when she was only six, along with the princess of the Tipam King as ransom, as this is the common heinous practice in almost all Muslim conquest. Her father had to bound to deliver her daughter as a war ransom at Aurangzeb's court on 15 January 1663. She was given the Muslim name of Rahmat Banu Begum after her forceful conversion to Islam, and was brought up in the imperial harem. Five years later, she was forcibly married to Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Azam Shah on Sunday, 13 May 1668, with a dowry of 1,80,000 rupees at Delhi. By the time, Guwahati was recovered from the Mughals by king Supangmung with the help of famous Ahom general Lachit Borphukan in the famous battle of Battle of Saraighat. Lachit Borphukan earned much fame by defeating famous Mughal general Ram Singha in this battle. Had there been no Lachit Borphukan, the general of the Ahom Army, it would have been utterly impossible on the part of the Ahoms to win the battle. In that case Guwahati would have remained as the part of Mughal Empire as before. Even after being defeated in the hands of Lachit Bagphukanas, Ram Singh I spoke highly of the manifold qualities of the Ahom Soldiers. Then, after a period of some years, it was proposed that Guwahati should be given to the Mughals and in return Laluksola, the viceroy of Ahoms at Guwahati will be made the king. When Ramani Gabharu came to know about it, she wrote a letter to her maternal uncle Laluksola Borphukan warning him not to do such an act of betrayal. However, Laluksola Borphukan did not listen to his noble niece.

Overview Saint Peter's Healthcare System was formed in 2007. Besides Saint Peter's University Hospital, the system includes the Saint Peter's Foundation and the Saint Peter's Health and Management Services Corporation, which oversees various initiatives, including the CARES Surgicenter, an ambulatory surgery center adjacent to the hospital in New Brunswick, and a Family Health Center in New Brunswick that serves, among others, juvenile victims of sexual abuse, economically disadvantaged families and mentally disabled and/or violence- prone youth. In late 2019 it was announced that the leaders of RWJBarnabas Health and the leaders of Saint Peter's Healthcare System signed a letter of intent to explore a merger. The preliminary plan calls for significant investments in Saint Peter‚Äôs by RWJBarnabas Health to help expand the outpatient services currently provided by Saint Peter‚Äôs. Saint Peter‚Äôs would remain a Catholic hospital and continue its sponsorship by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Metuchen. According to administrations from both hospitals, the two parties have been in discussions for awhile and believe they could both benefit from the merger. The merger would also strengthen education services provided at the two already Rutgers affiliated hospitals. On September 10, 2020 it was announced that the health systems had signed a definitive agreement that the two systems would merge. The merger would create the largest academic medical center in the state. After the signing of the agreement, the potential partnership began a period of review by state and federal regulatory agencies.

Reception Just like its predecessor, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures 2 received mixed to positive reviews upon release. Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 3 out of 5, saying \\"While the first title burst onto the scene brimming with creativity not usually seen in a television cartoon adaption, the sequel is content to emulate everything that title did without adding anything notable of its own.\\" News10 gave the game a 1.5 out of 4, saying \\"Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures 2 is in a weird place for a kids' video game. Younger and more novice gamers might find the game too difficult to play at times, and it may turn them off from it. Those at the older end of the kids' game scene might instead find the game too simple at times and justifiably frustrating to control. Kids who really enjoy the television program will no doubt want (and probably enjoy) this game based on its subject matter alone. Those who aren't in love with modern Pac-Man might want to let this game give up the ghost.\\" The Guardian gave the game a negative review, saying \\"In some ways, the game‚Äôs simple ambitions would not have been a problem if the recipe had been respectfully crafted.

Amateur career  Standen had a promising start to his career in January 1927, winning the NSW Amateur titles over one mile and five miles. He entered the Australian Track Championships and Olympic tests at 18 years old, finishing first in every event he entered however he was disqualified in the Australian mile championship for interference with Dunc Gray. Standen and Gray were selected to represent Australia in track cycling at the 1928 Summer Olympics. No rider was sent for the road events, with Fatty Lamb being controversially overlooked, so Standen was entered for the road race, despite not competing in the Australian Olympic trial for that event. Standen however didn't start the road race. Standen won his preliminary round, but was beaten in the quarter finals. Following the Olympics, Standen competed at the 1928 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Budapest, Hungary where he won bronze in the amateur men's sprint. Professional career  In January 1929 Standen turned professional to compete at the newly constructed Canterbury Velodrome, a board track in Charles St Canterbury. As a part of his selection for the Olympics, Standen had entered into a bond to repay his travel costs of ¬£360 if he turned professional within two years. Standen argued the bond should not be enforced as he was a minor at the time.. As he did not repay the bond, Standen was suspended by the UCI for the balance of the 2 years. In 1932 Standen won the Brisbane Six Day with Fatty Lamb defeating a quality field including Frankie Thomas, Hubert Opperman and Jack Fitzgerald.

Archivio storico italiano, 137(499), 51-90. and the subject of the stageplay ‚ÄúMenocchio‚Äù (2002), by Lillian Garrett-Groag. Biography His parents were Zuane and Menega. He lived most of his life in Montereale, except for two years when he was banished from the town for brawling. He had learned to read and read a number of contemporary works on religion and history. From these, he developed his religious views that departed substantially from Catholic orthodoxy of the time. He was first tried for heresy in 1583, and abjured his statements in 1584, but spent another 20 months in prison in Concordia. Released in 1586, he claimed to have reformed. He continued to be in house arrest and had to wear a sign of a burning cross on his garments as a visible sign of his crimes. In 1598, he was arrested again as a lapsed heretic, having continued to propagate his beliefs. In 1599, he was declared a heresiarch and was executed by burning. Views During his trial, he argued that the only sin was to harm one's neighbor and that to blaspheme caused no harm to anyone but the blasphemer. He further said that Jesus was born of man and Mary was not a virgin, that the pope had no power given to him from God but simply exemplified the qualities of a good man, and that Christ had not died to \\"redeem humanity\\". =Views on rites= Among the numerous accusations of blasphemy leveled against him, was a charge of contradicting the teachings of the Church on purgatory. Vicar Maro asked Menocchio were it true he had said that Masses for the dead were useless? (According to Giuliano Stefanut, the words spoken by Menocchio had been precisely: \\"What are you doing giving alms in memory of these few ashes?\\"). Menocchio replied that \\"I meant, that we should be concerned about helping each other while we are still in this world, because afterwards God is the one who governs over souls; the prayers and alms and Masses offered for the dead are done, as I understand it, for love of God, who then does as he pleases, because souls do not come to take those prayers and alms, and it belongs to the majesty of God to receive these good works either for the benefit of the living or the dead\\". In additional criticisms against the Church Menocchio declared that he rejected all the sacraments, including baptism, as human inventions, and mere \\"merchandise,\\" instruments of exploitation and oppression in the hands of the clergy. He stated \\"I believe that the law and commandments of the Church are all a matter of business, and they make their living from this.\\" Regarding baptism he states \\"I believe that as soon as we are born we are baptized, because God who has blessed all things, has baptized us; but this other baptism is an invention, and priests begin to consume souls even before they are born and continue to devour them even after their death.\\" Regarding confirmation he stated \\"I believe it is a business, an invention of men, all of whom have the Holy Spirit; they seek to know and they know nothing.\\" Regarding marriage he stated \\"God did not establish it, men did. Formerly a man and a woman would exchange vows, and this sufficed; later these human inventions followed.\\" =Views on the clergy= With a violent outburst against his judges and their doctrinal arrogance, he proclaimed \\"You priests and monks, you too want to know more than God, and you are like the devil, and you want to become gods on earth, and know as much as God, following in the footsteps of the devil. In fact, the more one thinks he knows, the less he knows\\". Regarding the priesthood he states \\"I believe the spirit of God dwells in all of us ... and I also believe that anyone who has studied can become a priest without being ordained, because it is all a business.\\" Views on the wealth of the clergy Menocchio went on to say \\"And it seems to me that under our law, the pope, cardinals, and bishops are so great and rich that everything belongs to the church and to the priests, and they oppress the poor, who, if they work two rented fields, these will be fields that belong to the Church, to some bishop or cardinal\\". =Views on the court= On the 28th of April, he began by denouncing the way the rich tyrannized the poor in the courts by using such an incomprehensible language as Latin (see Law Latin), stating \\"I think speaking Latin is a betrayal of the poor because in lawsuits the poor do not know what is being said and are crushed; and if they want to say four words they need a lawyer\\". He further criticized the Church and Court proceedings by stating \\"God has given the Holy Spirit to all, to Christians, to heretics, to Turks, and to Jews; and he considers them all dear, and they are all saved in the same manner.\\" See also References Category:1532 births Category:1599 deaths Category:Catholicism-related controversies Category:Executed Italian people Category:People executed by the Papal States by burning Category:People executed by the Roman Inquisition Category:People executed for heresy ","title":"Menocchio"},{"id":"43045552","text":"Herpes may refer to: * Genital herpes, a genital infection * Herpes simplex, a disease * Herpes zoster, a disease better known as shingles *Herpes labialis, a disease * Herpes (journal), a peer-reviewed medical journal published by Cambridge Medical Publication * Herpes (weevil), a beetle genus in the tribe Thecesternini * Herpes simplex virus, organism that causes infection *Herpesviridae, a large family of viruses ","title":"Herpes (disambiguation)"},{"id":"43045560","title":"Kathryn McGarry"},{"id":"43045571","text":"Antonio Malvassi (born 1904, date of death unknown) was an Argentine cyclist.

Formerly known as Andy's Cheesesteaks and Cheeseburgers, the first location opened in Goldsboro, North Carolina, in 1991. It now has 135 restaurants in the United States. History and operations A Hwy 55 in Raleigh, North Carolina's Crabtree Valley Mall Kenney Moore began the business in 1991 by opening a now-defunct restaurant in Goldsboro, North Carolina's Berkeley Mall. He asked the owners of his equipment to in-house finance his operation as he only had $500 to his name. Moore quickly acquired three more closed restaurants and found himself $30,000 in debt to his foodservice distributor. After adapting Robert K. Greenleaf's philosophy of servant leadership, his fortunes turned. Moore switched to a franchisee style of ownership and Andy's Cheesesteaks and Cheeseburgers expanded throughout Eastern North Carolina. In February 2012, Andy's announced that it had changed its name to Hwy 55 Burgers, Shakes & Fries, an homage to North Carolina Highway 55, which runs across the state. The company's decor, always influenced by 1950s-era diners, also took on a pink-and-teal color scheme. In May, the company opened a franchised store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the first location outside the state of North Carolina. The first international locations followed in 2014 with openings in Abu Dhabi. In 2012, Moore said that he hopes to open 500 restaurants globally in the next seven years. In 2013, Hwy 55 was named a top-40 food franchise by the Franchise Business Review.Today's Top 40 Food Franchises. \\"Franchise Business Review,\\" Fall(2013), pp. 8-9. Restaurants A Hwy 55 restaurant usually has a 1950s theme, with pink-and-teal color accents and '50s decor mounted on the walls. Kitchens are open, whereby customers can watch cooks grill their food.  Charity  In 2006, Hwy 55 created the Andy's Charitable Foundation, Inc. as a 501(C)3 corporation with the \\"mission to serve the common good of all people in our hometowns.\\" To date, it has raised over $1,400,000 for local charities, including the Miracle League of the Triangle, of which it is a major sponsor.

The law expanded the number of options veterans have for receiving care and granted the United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs more power to fire senior executives. The Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014 began with the discovery that there was on- going systematic lying by the Veterans Health Administration about the wait times veterans experienced waiting to be seen by doctors.Griffin, Richard J., Acting Inspector General, Interim Report: Review of Patient Wait Times, Scheduling Practices, and Alleged Patient Deaths at the Phoenix Health Care System, VA Office of Inspector General, Veterans Health Administration, Dept. of Veterans Affairs, May 28, 2014, 14-02603-178, Washington, D.C., retrieved June 7, 2014 By June 5, 2014, Veterans Affairs internal investigations had identified a total of 35 veterans who had died while waiting for care in the Phoenix VHA system. Another audit determined that \\"more than 57,000 veterans waited at least 90 days to see a doctor, while another 63,000 over the last decade never received an initial appointment.\\" The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress under the name \\"Pay Our Guard and Reserve Act\\" as one of the October 2013 mini-continuing resolutions passed by the House during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. It became law on August 7, 2014. The law includes access to healthcare at non-VA hospitals for rural veterans, as well as vast increases in staffing and facilities at existing VA medical centers. Background CNN reported on April 27, 2014 that at least 40 United States Armed Forces veterans died while waiting for care at the Phoenix, Arizona, Veterans Health Administration facilities. By June 5, 2014, Veterans Affairs internal investigations had identified a total of 35 veterans who had died while waiting for care in the Phoenix VHA system. An investigation of delays in treatment throughout the Veterans Health Administration system is being conducted by the Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector General, and the House has passed legislation to fund a $1 million criminal investigation by the Justice Department. On May 16, 2014, the Veterans Health Administration's top health official, Dr. Robert Petzel, retired early at the request of Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki.

Approximately $500 million would be used for hiring more doctors and nurses to work for the VA. *Veterans who live over 40 miles away from the nearest VA health clinic or who are unable to get an appointment in a reasonable time frame would be able to receive \\"choice cards\\" allowing them to seek treatment from a non-VA facility. This would be a pilot program lasting for two years. Veterans would be allowed to go to other providers that accept Medicare, the military's health program TRICARE, or at facilities run by the United States Department of Defense. *The Secretary of Veterans Affairs would have increased power to fire senior executives. The executives could be removed immediately from the payroll and would only have a week to appeal being fired. Three weeks later, a merit board would make a final decision in that person's case. *The bill would authorize the VA to build 26 new facilities. *The bill would require public colleges and universities to grant veterans in-state tuition. *The bill would improve the medical care that victims of military sexual assault receive. *The Act shifts the cost of the medical treatment and care to the veteran's private insurance planPublic Law 113-146, Section 101(e)(3)(B)(i) and the Veterans Administration now requires joining the Choice program as a condition of receiving medical care, although this change has not been published. Congressman Jeff Miller's House Committee reportHouse Committee Veterans Affairs Fact Sheet contained in the Conference Report on HR 3230 anticipated a $200,000,000 recovery from veterans' private health plans, but with only 84,386 appointments made through the first six months of 2015, shifting the cost to the private sector has not been successful. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced in the Senate on June 10, 2014. This is a public domain source. Title III of S. 2450 was incorporated completely into H.R. 3230. This relationship was identified by the Congressional Research Service. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has prepared a preliminary analysis of Title III of S. 2450, the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014, as introduced in the Senate on June 10, 2014. That title would authorize and fund enhancements to several programs of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In particular, VA would receive expansive authority for the next few years to contract with health care providers who are not employed by the VA, and VA would be required to use that authority to ensure that all eligible veterans would receive requested health care in a timely fashion. The effects of providing such broad new authority to VA are highly uncertain, and CBO has been able to make only a preliminary and partial assessment of the legislation. Based on that preliminary assessment, CBO estimates that enacting Title III of S. 2450 would increase direct spending by roughly $35 billion over the 2014-2024 period. CBO has not yet estimated the budgetary effects of the other titles of S. 2450. VA currently has about 8.4 million veterans enrolled in its health care program. Of the remaining roughly 13 million living veterans, CBO estimates that about 8 million qualify to enroll in VA's health care program but have not enrolled. VA currently spends about $44 billion providing health care services to veterans, or about $5,200 per enrollee. (That amount does not include spending on programs that CBO expects would not be increased under this legislation, such as long-term care, caregivers, and ending veterans' homelessness.) Based on information from VA on veterans' reliance on VA, CBO estimates that this cost represents about 30 percent of the total amount of health care received by those veterans. CBO estimates that, under Title III, enrolled veterans would ultimately seek to increase the amount of care they receive from VA by about 60 percent. In addition, CBO expects that some of the people who are eligible to enroll but not yet enrolled would choose to enroll because of the improvement in access to health care through VA. Most of the costs incurred to provide that care would be for care financed by other payers, including Medicare; a portion of those costs would thus be offset by savings to the Medicare program. All told, CBO expects that veterans would ultimately seek additional care that would cost the federal government about $50 billion a year, on net. However, CBO expects that VA would have difficulty in quickly setting up a program to contract for health care nationwide and in establishing administrative processes to approve care by private health care providers. Moreover, the amount of care that veterans sought through VA might increase gradually over time. Thus, CBO expects that, of the amount of additional care sought by veterans, VA would provide only about 20 percent in 2015 and about 50 percent in 2016. VA would also spend a comparatively small amount in 2014 on administration and new hiring. Thus, CBO estimates that implementing title III would cost roughly $500 million in 2014, $10 billion in 2015, and $25 billion in 2016. The magnitude of those budgetary effects is highly uncertain. A significant number of veterans could receive new and expanded health care benefits under S. 2450. How many would ultimately receive those benefits and the resulting costs will depend on a number of factors that are very difficult to predict. Further, the specific parameters of the new program would depend on regulations that would need to be developed. Because the behavioral changes that would result from enacting those provisions are so uncertain, this estimate should be viewed as falling in the middle of a wide range of possible outcomes. Procedural history The bill H.R. 3230 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on October 2, 2013 by Rep. Hal Rogers (R-KY) as the \\"Pay Our Guard and Reserve Act\\". The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Appropriations. The bill was one of the October 2013 mini-continuing resolutions passed by the House during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. On October 3, 2013 the House voted in Roll Call Vote 516 to pass the bill 265-160. On June 11, 2014, the United States Senate changed the name of the bill to the \\"Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014\\" and voted to pass the bill 93-3 in Roll Call Vote 187. Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Jeff Miller said that \\"many of the provisions included in today's Senate-passed bill are based on ideas that have already cleared the House, so I'm hopeful both chambers of Congress can soon agree on a final package to send to the president's desk.\\" Miller was referring to the Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 4810; 113th Congress) which contained similar provisions and passed the House on June 10, 2014. The House and Senate established a conference committee to agree on amendments to the bill. The committee met on June 24, 2014. The House voted to agree to the conference report on July 30, 2014 with a vote of 420-5 in Roll Call Vote 467. The Senate voted to agree to the conference report on July 31, 2014 with a vote of 91-3 in Roll Call Vote 254. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on August 7, 2014. Debate and discussion Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were the two main senators who negotiated the bipartisan initiative. McCain said \\"is this a final solution to these problems? No, but it is a beginning.\\" McCain also called the situation an \\"emergency\\" and said \\"if it's not an emergency that we've neglected these brave men and women who have protected our country, then I don't know what is.\\" Only three senators voted against the bill, Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Bob Corker (R-TN), and Ron Johnson (R-WI). Expansion of Eligibility On April 19, 2017, President Donald Trump signed a bill into law extending the act and expanding the eligibility for the program, where veterans are given the option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.(). Trump has been accused of claiming that his administration was the first to pass the bill, despite the fact that it was passed in 2014 before he was president. Outcomes Failures with the VA Choice program emerged in a 2017 whistleblower case concerning the Manchester VA Medical Center, in which one of the administrators of the VA Choice program, Health Net Federal Services, failed to schedule appointments for New Hampshire veterans, leaving some veterans with life-threatening conditions waiting for over six months just to see a doctor. On April 27, 2017, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13793 (Improving Accountability and Whistleblower Protection at the Department of Veterans Affairs) to help whistleblowers and increase accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

She was created and designed by Rick Dyer and Don Bluth and introduced in the original Dragon's Lair in 1983. In the games, Princess Daphne is the beautiful daughter of King Aethelred and an unnamed queen. She serves as the series' damsel in distress. A beautiful maiden coveted by many princes and knights, her heart belongs to the kingdom's champion, Dirk the Daring. Appearances In the original Dragon's Lair game, Princess Daphne is kidnapped by the dragon Singe and imprisoned in a large crystal orb. Singe commanded King Aethelred to surrender his kingdom before sunset or the princess would die. Daphne appears in the final level of the game, giving Dirk directions to use the magic sword and slay the dragon. The story has been described by Crash as \\"a cross between an Arthurian romance and George and the Dragon.\\" In Dragon's Lair: Escape from Singe's Castle, the just-rescued Daphne has been cursed and falls asleep, but Dirk brings her back to life with a kiss, only to see her vanish. Then a figure known as the Shape Shifter appears to tell him that Singe was only guarding the gold of the wizard they are serving and Daphne belongs to him. It vanishes among smoke, and Dirk sets off to save the princess. In Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp, 10 years have passed after her adventure with Singe. Daphne and Dirk are married and have 13 children. However, she is again abducted, this time by the evil wizard Mordroc, who moves her through time and wants to enslave her with the Ring of Death (the same ring as in Der Ring des Nibelungen). At the end of the game, the Ring transforms her into a monster, but Dirk saves her by removing it from her finger and then revives her with a kiss. The game also features Daphne's mother, who is shown as a fat and furious woman chasing Dirk at the start of the game. In Dragon's Lair III: The Curse of Mordread, Mordroc's evil witch sister Mordread captures Dirk's homestead into an orb on her staff. Dirk was not in the house, so he begins pursuing Mordread to restore his home, and Daphne inside it. Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair follows a similar story as the first two games, as Daphne is captured by Singe commanded by Mordroc and taken through a portal, but leaves behind an amulet that allows her to talk to and guide Dirk as he works his way through the castle holding her prisoner. She is impersonated by Dirk's dark alter-ego, later revealing that the \\"Daphne\\" Dirk was speaking to had been Mordroc all along. Dirk eventually defeats Mordroc and saves the princess. In the cartoon series, her character and role are far more developed. She is an adventurous character, eagerly abandoning her regal persona to join Dirk and Timothy during their adventures. Design and portrayal Princess Daphne was originally created by Rick Dyer's Advanced Microcomputer Systems (AMS, later RDI Video Systems) team, then completely redesigned by the ex-Disney artist and animator Don Bluth. Bluth took his inspiration from photographs from the producer Gary Goldman's collection of old issues of Playboy magazine, ultimately putting Daphne \\"in a very-revealing one piece 'thong' bathing suit with a sheer veil that partially covered her.\\"\\"The making of... Dragon's Lair\\". Retro Gamer 24. Due to the limited budget's constraints, Daphne's in-game vocals were supplied by the head of AMS' Clean-up Department, Vera Lanpher. For Dragon's Lair II, where Daphne is after experiencing more than a dozen births, Bluth said \\"he thought it would be interesting if Daphne looked just as beautiful as ever; there's absolutely no sign she's been through anything.\\" Professional voice actress Ellen Gerstell voiced the character in the cartoon, wherein her attire is a less-revealing dress. Reception Princess Daphne was met with mostly positive reception and greatly contributed to the success of the game, which was then ported to various home platforms and followed by several sequels, remakes and spin-offs. She has been cited by multiple publications as one of the most attractive characters in video game history. UGO included her on their 2010 list of top 50 \\"video game hotties\\", stating: \\"When the game was released, Daphne was the best-looking video game heroine around, so we still have a bit of a soft spot for her today.\\" Including her at the 14th place on a similar list in 2012, Larry Hester of Complex opined Daphne \\"might be the finest damsel in distress ever. Sorry, Peach, Disney-style cel animation wins again.\\" Back in 1983, JoyStik's Joe Mendsky wrote \\"Daphne may look like the closest thing to a porn star in the annals of the video game, but she's not dumb. She's seen the line of quarters across the floor at the Denver arcade.\\" Nearly three decades later, Complex said of her that there has \\"only ever really been one reason to play Dragon's Lair,\\" and stated: \\"Never mind that the gameplay was nothing more than a quarter-sucking game of trial-and-error and memorization. And, oh, God: Princess Daphne and her little sheer black dress. Jesus Christ. She was way too sexy. Our little brains exploded.\\" Ranking her as the 14th \\"hottest video game girl of all time\\" in 2013, Steve Jenkins of CheatCodes.com wrote, \\"Don Bluth's animated portrayal of Daphne, the princess who just can't seem to keep out of trouble, was the real attraction in this game‚Ä¶ and attractive she was. (...) Princess Daphne's love of shear(sic!) clothing, plunging necklines, and her eternal 'damsel in distress' neediness made 50 cents a bargain to spend some quality time with her.\\" Writing about the reason Dragon's Lair became so popular, Nikola Suprak of Hardcore Gamer stated: \\"Years of playing video games has made me very familiar with the 'save the princess' motif, which makes me extremely suspicious about Daphne's princess credentials. There is a far greater chance that she is just a stripper with the stage name Princess than an actual princess, because if actual princesses dressed like she did the royal weddings wouldn't be so boring to watch.\\" Jon M. Gibson of GameSpy called Daphne \\"the epitome of a damsel in distress\\". Rob Mead of ST Format wrote \\"Daphne has to be the dippiest woman on the planet. She's gone and got herself kidnapped again. Can you believe it? The woman is a victim. She might as well walk around with the words 'Kidnap me' tattooed on her forehead.\\" Charlie Barratt of GamesRadar included her among the seven \\"damsels you DON'T want to save,\\" arguing that \\"underneath the skimpy leotard and fluttering eyelashes, Daphne's no deeper than a cardboard cutout. No smarter than a blow-up doll bimbo. Nothing more than salacious and cynical bait for your hard-earned quarters (and Dragon's Lair swallowed a LOT of quarters).\\" Glamour model Tara Babcock ranked the \\"beyond beautiful\\" Daphne as the 16th \\"hottest video game\\" and wrote that \\"her half-naked, yet regal appearance, flowing blonde hair, big eyes with batting lashes and cute, ditzy appearance ... has been the subject of much controversy over 'sexism' in gaming!\\" Daphne's voice was described by Earl Green of Classic Gamer Magazine as \\"a high pitched voice that could cause harm to small pets.\\" Green also wrote that \\"those of us who were entering adolescence at the time never quite forgave the TV show for covering Princess Daphne up, even though a vast improvement was made in giving her more personality and more intelligence, rather than the original game's helium- voiced ditzy blonde.\\" Reviewing Dragon's Lair 3D in 2002, GameSpot's Ryan Davis wrote Daphne \\"sounds just as squeaky and ditzy as she did in 1983.\\" Kristan Reed of Eurogamer wrote it \\"remains as simultaneously amusing and irritating as ever.\\" See also *DAPHNE, an emulator program to run the arcade version of Dragon's Lair and other LaserDisc games References External links * Princess Daphne on IMDb Category:Animated characters Category:Fantasy video game characters Category:Female characters in video games Category:Princess characters in video games Category:Video game characters in comics Category:Video game characters in television Category:Video game characters introduced in 1983 ","title":"Princess Daphne (character)"},{"id":"43045799","text":"White-winged tit may refer to: * White-naped tit (Machlolophus nuchalis) of Asia * White-winged black tit (Melaniparus leucomelas) of Africa ","title":"White-winged tit"},{"id":"43045814","text":"The Defence Force Commendation Medal was instituted by the State President of the Republic of Bophuthatswana in 1982.

Institution The Defence Force Commendation Medal was instituted by the State President of Bophuthatswana in 1982. It is the junior award of a set of three decorations for merit, along with the Defence Force Merit Decoration and the Defence Force Merit Medal. Bophuthatswana's military decorations and medals were modelled on those of the Republic of South Africa and these three decorations are the approximate equivalents of, respectively, the Southern Cross Decoration and Pro Merito Decoration, the Southern Cross Medal (1975) and Pro Merito Medal (1975), and the Military Merit Medal. Award criteria The medal could be awarded to all ranks for service of a high standard. Order of wear Since the Defence Force Commendation Medal was authorised for wear by one of the statutory forces which came to be part of the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994, it was accorded a position in the official South African order of precedence on that date.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 ;Bophuthatswana Defence Force until 26 April 1994: Marumo Medal, Class I Defence Force Commendation Medal Marumo Medal, Class II *Official BDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Marumo Medal, Class I. ** Succeeded by the Marumo Medal, Class II. *Bophuthatswana official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Medal of the Order of the Leopard. ** Succeeded by the Marumo Medal, Class II. ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: Military Merit Medal (MMM) Defence Force Commendation Medal Defence Force Medal *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Military Merit Medal (MMM) of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Defence Force Medal of the Republic of Venda. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the National Intelligence Service Decoration, Bronze of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Defence Force Medal of the Republic of Venda.

He is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Prior to entering federal politics, he served as the Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for the provincial riding of Etobicoke Centre from 2014 to 2018. Background Baker grew up in the West End Toronto neighbourhood of Etobicoke and attended Toronto French School. He graduated with a BBA from the Schulich School of Business at York University and went on to work as a commercial banker for Scotiabank. He then accepted a position as an Executive Assistant to the Member of Parliament for Etobicoke Centre Borys Wrzesnewskyj before obtaining his Master of Business Administration from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. After graduation Baker became a management consultant with the Boston Consulting Group, working out of the New York and Toronto offices before starting his own consultancy based out of Toronto. Baker previously taught Master of Business Administration students at Schulich School of Business at York University. Baker has also worked on several charitable initiatives and community projects. These include serving as a board director for Leave out Violence, the Emerging Leaders Network, and Global Grassroots, where he supported emerging female leaders in Rwanda on projects addressing issues such as lack of access to water, domestic violence and health education. He is a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. Political career =Provincial Politics= Baker was elected to the Ontario Legislature in 2014 as the MPP for Etobicoke Centre. He currently serves as Parliamentary Assistant to Charles Sousa, Minister of Finance. Previously, Baker served as Parliamentary Assistant to Deb Matthews, President of the Treasury Board from 2014‚Äì2016. Other current legislative roles include Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister Responsible for Digital Government; Commissioner, Board of Internal Economy; and Vice-Chair, Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs.  Private Members' Public Bills  In May 2015, Baker introduced the Ontario Flag Day Act, 2015 which sought to proclaim May 21 of each year as Ontario Flag Day. The bill passed with the unanimous support of all three parties. Baker also introduced \\"Pathways to Post-secondary Excellence Act\\", which would make it easier for high school students to research post-secondary educational institutions. This would be done by centralizing data in the areas of admission, student experience and outcomes for recent graduates \\". The bill was endorsed by the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance, Canadian Federation of Students, the College Student Alliance and the Graduate Student Alliance. The bill didn't make it past first reading. In 2017 Baker proposed the \\"Phones Down, Heads Up Act,\\" a bill to fine pedestrians between $50 and $125 for texting while crossing the street. The bill attracted criticism from Ontario New Democratic Party MPP Cheri DiNovo and pedestrian-safety advocacy group Walk Toronto, who argued that there is little evidence that distracted walking is a risk, and that it shifts the safety onus from drivers to pedestrians.  Community Involvement  In Etobicoke Centre, Baker hosted Community Recognition Awards annually which highlighted local individuals and organizations for making a difference in the community. The awards were available in four categories; Outstanding Volunteer Service to the Community, Outstanding Volunteer Service to Seniors, Outstanding Volunteer Service to the Community by Youth and Outstanding Service by Professional Staff. Approximately 30 individuals and organizations are honoured every year. An annual Government and Community Services Fair was co-hosted every year by Baker and Etobicoke‚ÄîLakeshore MPP Peter Milczyn. In 2015, the event featured more than 110 exhibitors from the provincial government, agencies and community organizations. Baker also hosted monthly Seniors Advisory Group meetings, which discussed topics that are important to seniors in Etobicoke Centre. =Federal Politics= On October 30, 2018, Baker announced his intention to seek the Liberal Party of Canada nomination in the federal riding of Etobicoke Centre. =Election results= References External links * Category:1977 births Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Boston Consulting Group people Category:Canadian people of Ukrainian descent Category:Living people Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:People from Etobicoke Category:Politicians from Toronto Category:Tuck School of Business alumni Category:York University alumni Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario ","title":"Yvan Baker"},{"id":"43045920","text":"Ray Charles (1930‚Äì2004) was an American singer-songwriter, musician and composer.

Dewey-free systems are often based on the BISAC subject headings developed by the Book Industry Study Group, and are typically implemented in libraries with smaller collections. Instead of using numerical notation to indicate a document's shelving location, Dewey-free systems organize documents alphabetically by natural language words. Dewey-free systems have been implemented in both public and school libraries. Motivations A primary motivation for the development of Dewey-free systems is to eliminate DDC's numerical notation, which many library patrons find intimidating. Abandoning numerical notation in favor of natural language words may also facilitate browsing. Adoption of Dewey-free classification is often seen as part of a greater trend of using a \\"bookstore model\\" to deliver library services. This trend gained traction in 1998 with an article by Los Angeles librarian Steve Coffman. While some librarians see this as a beneficial approach that will make patrons more comfortable and increase circulation statistics, others disagree with the approach, particularly as large bookstores such as Borders Group have met severe financial challenges. Many Dewey-free proponents believe that Dewey is outdated and ill-suited for non-academic environments. DDC organizes documents not only by subject, but also by academic discipline. This leads to materials on the same topic being filed in wildly disparate locations. For example, Dewey places books about railroad trains in both the 380s and the 620s. The discipline-based orientation is also problematic for categorizing interdisciplinary works and non-academic titles, which make up the bulk of most public libraries' non- fiction holdings. DDC has also faced a number of critiques for its biases. Scholars and catalogers have specifically criticized its marginalization of developing countries and continents, Christian-centrism, racism, sexism, homophobia, and marginalization of intersex people. Some proponents of Dewey- free systems suggest that abandoning DDC in favor of new schemes may address these problems, but the literature doesn't include any analysis of BISAC Subject Headings for these issues, nor have any Dewey-free libraries documented strategies for addressing these issues within the taxonomies they have devised. Librarians who work with children point to additional benefits within their collections. They note that school library workers often have little support and few resources for teaching the DDC system to children. The numbers themselves are often opaque to younger students, who typically don't learn about decimals until late in elementary school. Adoption In the 1970s and 1980s, public libraries in the United Kingdom and United States designed new \\"reader-interest classification\\" systems as alternatives to DDC. These systems organized materials in ways that are intuitive to non-academic users and employed modern terminology, resulting in collections that are more browsable. However, a lack of standardization led libraries to abandon these systems. Dewey-free classification schemes can be seen as new cases of reader- interest classification schemes. In 2007, the Maricopa County Library District announced that its Gilbert Library would abandon DDC in favor of a BISAC-based system. The library district reported the change as a success, with non- fiction circulation improving sixfold. In 2009, the Rangeview Library District became the first library district to fully convert to a BISAC-based scheme. Rangeview's classification system, which is branded as \\"WordThink\\", is based on BISAC headings. In 2011, the librarians at the Ethical Culture School in New York City developed a Dewey-Free system called Metis. The school's novel approach incorporated focus groups of students from Kindergarten through the Fifth Grade in designing the system. The Darien Library in Connecticut employs a hybrid approach to classification. While books are still organized by DDC number, DDC categories are \\"clumped into eight broad categories,\\" known as glades. A glade groups together books from several Dewey classes that Darien librarians feel may be useful to similar groups. For example, the Places glade is intended for international travellers, and combines books from the 400s (Languages) and 910s (Travel and Geography). The Nyack Library used a \\"marketplace\\" system similar to Darien's glades. However, after complaints from community members, the library reverted to a traditional DDC collection in 2013. The King County Library System announced in 2014 that all 48 of its branches will convert their fiction picture book collections to a Dewey-free subject classification system. Evaluation There has been very little formal evaluation of Dewey-free systems, even by libraries that have implemented them. Many libraries point to an increase in circulation statistics‚Äîeither for a particular topic or for the non-fiction collection as a whole‚Äîas a measure of the success of their Dewey-free systems. However, the correlation between circulation statistics and library classification scheme is not easy to demonstrate. Dewey-free reclassification projects are often undertaken in conjunction with other projects that aim to better merchandise a library's holdings, so it can be very unclear how much of a circulation increase can be attributed to a new classification scheme. Furthermore, library scholars typically warn against using circulation statistics as the sole metric of any project's success, because such statistics fail to account for materials used within the library, materials that were circulated but never read, or materials that were circulated but failed to provide users with the information they needed. Call numbers are generally not indexed by Integrated Library Systems, so the adoption of word-based classification systems has had little impact on information retrieval quality within library catalogs to date. Criticisms Critics of the new systems argue that BISAC's broad categories actually impede browsing, as many different subtopics are interspersed with one another. They prefer DDC's arrangement of materials by specific subject. They also argue that many of the issues addressed by Dewey- free systems could be resolved much more easily with improved signage and book labels. Even proponents of Dewey-free systems note that BISAC-based classification systems would be unsuitable for libraries with large or specialized collections. Critics have also questioned the pedagogical value of Dewey-free classifications, questioning whether library patrons used to a Dewey-free system will have the skills necessary to navigate collections classified according to DDC or Library of Congress Classification. Critics have also noted that using English words instead of numbers for all classification sends a message that libraries are only interested in serving English speakers.

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the first round of the 2008 MLB Draft and spent seven seasons in the Phillies' minor league system, never reaching higher than Class Double-A baseball. Early life Hewitt was born in Brooklyn, New York, and attended public school there before transferring to the Salisbury School, a preparatory academy in Connecticut. Early in his life, Hewitt played basketball, but soon realized that his physique was most conducive to baseball and switched his emphasis to this sport. He was a New York Yankees fan, and \\"idolized\\" Alex Rodriguez. In high school, he played shortstop and was a strong hitter, the latter of which was the primary reason the Phillies drafted him in the first round of the 2008 MLB Draft. Professional career When the Phillies drafted Hewitt, he signed a contract that included a signing bonus, as well as money to pay for eight semesters at Vanderbilt University, which Hewitt planned to attend in the offseason as a business or economics major in the hopes of learning how to manage his money. Hewitt began his career with the GCL Phillies, the rookie affiliate of the Phillies organization, with whom he posted a .197 batting average with one home run and nine runs batted in (RBIs). The next year, as a member of the Williamsport Crosscutters, Hewitt marginally improved his performance at the plate, hitting .223 with seven home runs and 30 RBIs. During his first two seasons, he played third base and outfield; ultimately, the Phillies made him an outfielder. His next two years were with the Lakewood BlueClaws; in 2010, he had a \\"miserable\\" season, compiling a .202 batting average, barely above the \\"Mendoza Line\\". He understood the \\"high stakes\\" of his 2011 season, and he bounced back somewhat, totaling 14 home runs and 36 stolen bases to supplant his .240 batting average (both of which were professional career highs). Over the first few months of the season, he even had what one writer termed a \\"breakout\\" year before a mediocre second half of the season. In 2012, he was promoted to the Clearwater Threshers, of Class A-Advanced, with whom he posted a .241 batting average, 13 home runs, 50 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. He was promoted once again in 2013, joining a fellow first-round pick, Jesse Biddle, with the Double-A Reading Fightin' Phils. He seemed to be on an upward spiral, finally realizing his potential; he noted that he no longer sought to live up to others' expectations, and sought to live up only to his own, which helped him relax and play with confidence, according to manager Dusty Wathan, who also praised Hewitt's incessant strong work ethic. Concurrently, Hewitt once again improved his batting average (albeit minimally, going from .241 in 2012 to .244 in 2013), and hit a career- high 16 home runs. However, the 2014 season was his last in the Phillies' organization. After a \\"dismal\\" start to the season in Reading, he was demoted to Clearwater, from which the Phillies released him on June 12, 2014 after \\"failing to develop in seven disappointing seasons\\". Corey Seidman, a writer for Comcast SportsNet, summarized Hewitt's career with the Phillies as follows: Following his release by the Phillies, Hewitt signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles but only played 13 games for the Orioles High-A affiliate the Frederick Keys. On March 24, 2016, Hewitt signed with the New Britain Bees of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, joining fellow former Phillies first round pick Greg Golson.

Installed in 1973, it was named after its benefactor, Hugh Carter, who drowned only days after the fountain's inauguration. Background The Carter Fountain was installed in 1973 and first switched on in March of that year. It was originally to be named the Oriental Bay Fountain until the untimely death of its benefactor. At a cost of NZ$75,000, the fountain was a gift to the city of Wellington from local resident Hugh Carter. Carter was inspired by the Jet d'Eau fountain he saw in Geneva in the early 1960s. Carter initially dedicated the fountain to his parents George and Ella Carter who paid for the Oriental Parade flower garden. Tragedy struck just days after the fountain was officially opened. Carter was about to sail to Nelson on his launch Kualani when he slipped and drowned in Wellington Harbour aged 55. The fountain was named the Carter Fountain as a mark of respect. The fountain was originally maintained by the Wellington Harbour Board, and with the 1989 local government reforms, this responsibility transferred to the Wellington City Council. Operation The Band Rotunda houses the land based electrical equipment and a wind sensor The fountain spouts water into the air. Following complaints from local residents about salt spray, a wind sensor was installed on the nearby band rotunda that prevents the fountain from operating above a given wind speed; sources vary whether this is . The band rotunda also holds the land-based electrical components for the fountain. Monthly maintenance is carried out by an electrician, who reaches the fountain in a row boat. Twice a year, divers check on the submerged pump. The annual maintenance costs NZ$45,000, of which NZ$20,000 is for electricity. The cost for replacing the pump in 2009 was NZ$29,000, during which time the fountain was out of operation for half a year. Eight floodlights are used to light and colour the fountain. The halogen lights were replaced in 2013 by LED light at a cost of NZ$21,000, with the new lights lasting up to 50,000 hours compared to 2,000 hours previously, and being able to be remote controlled.

Screening is a medical test in a healthy person who is showing no symptoms of a disease and is intended to detect a disease so that a person may prepare to respond to it. Screening is indicated in people who have some threshold risk for getting a disease, but is not indicated in people who are unlikely to develop a disease. Overscreening is a type of unnecessary health care. Overscreening is problematic because it can lead to risky or harmful additional treatment when a healthy person gets a false positive result for screening which they should not have had. It also causes unnecessary stress for the person receiving the test, and it brings unnecessary financial costs that someone pays. The general rule is that people should only be screened for a medical condition when there is a reason to believe that they ought to be screened, such a medical guideline recommendation for screening based on evidence from a person's medical history or physical examination. Controversy and debate arise when new medical guidelines change screening recommendations. Definition Screening is a type of medical test which is done on health people who do not show symptoms of a medical condition. * * Screenings are correctly performed when done on a person who has significant risk of developing a medical condition, and incorrectly performed when done on a person whose risk is not significant. There can be debate about when risk becomes great enough to become significant and merit a recommendation for screening, but in discussions about overscreening, this is not the cause of the problem. Overscreening almost always happens when a person is screened routinely and without any consideration of their risk for a medical condition. One early use of the term \\"overscreening\\" as \\"unnecessary screening\\" was in 1992 in the context of cervical cancer screening.Please share any example of an earlier use of this term or any claim to coining this term on this article's talk page. * A 1979 paper used the term \\"overscreening\\" to mean \\"false positive result in a screening\\". Causes of overscreening =Same causes as unnecessary health care= Overscreening is a type of unnecessary health care, so the causes of unnecessary health care are also causes of overscreening. Some causes include financial biases for physicians to recommend more treatment in health care systems using fee-for-service and physician self-referral practices; and physicians' practice of defensive medicine. =Screening creep= Over time, recommendations to screen are made for populations with less risk in the past. Clinical practice guidelines advise physicians to screen early to detect diseases. It has been considered that guideline committees might not appropriately do cost-effectiveness analysis, consider opportunity cost, or evaluate risks to patients when they broaden screening recommendations. =Diagnostic creep= Over time, the indicators for making a diagnosis are lower so that people with fewer symptoms are diagnosed with a disease sooner. Additionally, new diseases are named and treatment is recommended, including \\"subclinical diseases\\", \\"preclinical diseases\\", or \\"pseudodiseases\\", which are described as early versions of a disease which has not manifested. =Patient demand= Patient demand is a sort of self-diagnosis in which patients request treatment regardless of whether the treatment they request is medically indicated. Causes for patients requesting treatment include increased access to health information on the Internet and direct-to-consumer advertising. Ethical concerns of screening under these circumstances have been described. =Distraction tricks by physicians= Physicians sometimes use screening as a placebo for patients who wish to have some kind of care. The physician may recommend screening to placate the patient's demand for fast recovery in times when the recommended action would be to do nothing except wait. Research suggests that patients are more satisfied with their treatment when it is or seems expensive because patients believe that the more care they get, even if it is not necessary, then at least doing something is better than doing nothing. Arguments against overscreening Overscreening is a type of unnecessary health care. One study about unnecessary screening before surgery reported that physicians order unnecessary tests because of tradition in the practice of medicine, anticipation that other physicians will expect the test results when they see the patient, defensive medicine, worries that a surgery may be canceled if the test is not done, and lack of understanding about when a test is actually indicated. =False positive medical test results= A false positive medical test result is a false-positive test result of medical screening. It happens when a test indicates that a person has a medical condition when actually the person does not. Overscreening can be a problem because it can generate a false positive medical test result in a healthy person who does not have the medical condition which screening is supposed to detect.Better citations are needed. The following sources describe the consequences of false positive results for certain conditions. No source is identified which says, \\"In general for many conditions false positive results are problematic.\\" In these sources, it is said that for the conditions described, false positive results lead to undesirable consequences. The sources seem to presume that all health care providers know the concept of a \\"false positive\\" and that it is not a desirable outcome without explaining why generally. Perhaps some textbook describes this concept?  * In such cases, the person who received the false positive test is more likely to get further unnecessary screening or even receive treatment for a condition which that person does not have. In either of these cases, the person becomes exposed to the risks and harms of treatment which they ought not be getting. In general, people should not have medical screening unless the screening is indicated by the person's medical history, a physical examination, and a medical guideline. The rationale for this is that in cases in which a person is unlikely to have a medical condition, it can be more likely that a test will give a false positive result than it would be for the test to detect something which is unlikely considering the person's medical history. If a false positive result does occur in a patient unlikely to have that disease, then that patient will be likely to seek treatment. =Unnecessary costs= Overscreening tends to happen more in circumstances in which medical billing happens based on fee-for-service models rather than bundled payment.This sort talks about overscreening without using the term and without being an authoritative review article. * One reason for this is because health care providers have incentive to provide more services to increase their revenue. Furthermore, when patients are shielded from cost sharing, that also tends to increase rates of overscreening as when patients pay nothing for additional treatment, they tend to request more services even when they are not indicated. Overscreening examples =Cancer screening= Prostate cancer screening The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against PSA screening in healthy men finding that the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits. Guidelines from the American Urological Association, and the American Cancer Society recommend that men be informed of the risks and benefits of screening. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends screening be discouraged in those who are expected to live less than ten years, while in those with a life expectancy of greater than ten years a decision should be made by the person in question based on the potential risks and benefits. In general, they conclude that based on recent research, \\"it is uncertain whether the benefits associated with PSA testing for prostate cancer screening are worth the harms associated with screening and subsequent unnecessary treatment.\\" Breast cancer screening Recommendations to attend to mammography screening vary across countries and organizations, with the most common difference being the age at which screening should begin, and how frequently or if it should be performed, among women at typical risk for developing breast cancer. Some other organizations recommend mammograms begin as early as age 40 in normal-risk women, and take place more frequently, up to once each year. Women at higher risk may benefit from earlier or more frequent screening. Women with one or more first-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter) with premenopausal breast cancer often begin screening at an earlier age, perhaps at an age 10 years younger than the age when the relative was diagnosed with breast cancer. =Heart related tests= Electrocardiography Electrocardiograms are sometimes inappropriately used to screen low-risk patients with no symptoms for cardiac disease, perhaps as part of a routine annual exam., which cites * There is not much evidence that this test in low-risk individuals can improve health outcomes. False positive results, however, are likely to lead to follow-up invasive procedures, unnecessary further treatment, and a misdiagnosis. The harms of a non-indicated annual screening have been determined to outweigh the potential benefit, and for that reason, screening without an indication is discouraged. Young athletes are sometimes screened with ECG as a requirement for them to play sports, and the necessity of this and harms from false positive results are debated. Heart imaging stress tests Cardiac stress tests, including stress echocardiography and nuclear stress tests, are used to detect a block in blood flow to the heart. They do this by taking pictures of the heart while the heart is exercising. Persons who have symptoms of heart disease or who are high risk for a heart attack may need this test, while people without these symptoms and who are low risk generally do not., which cites * Coronary computed tomography Coronary artery calcium scoring is a diagnostic test in the field of cardiovascular x-ray computed tomography. It is used to screen for coronary artery disease. Asymptomatic people who have low risk, including a lack of family history of premature coronary artery disease, should not be screened with this test., which cites * * Coronary computed tomography angiography should not be used to screen people who are asymptomatic. Additionally, this test rarely provides insight which cannot be gained from coronary artery calcium scoring., which cites #* #* Opinions about overscreening Overscreening has been called \\"unethical\\".

As a foundation school, Matravers is administered by Wiltshire Council. Pupils are admitted mainly from Bitham Brook Primary School, Bratton Primary School, Chapmanslade CE Primary School, Dilton Marsh CE Junior School, North Bradley CE Primary School, Westbury CE Junior School and Westbury Leigh CE Primary School. Matravers School offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels and further BTECs. History In his Will of 1814, John Matravers left ¬£1,000 for educational purposes, of which ¬£500 was to found a charity school for boys and girls living in the town of Westbury to be taught according to Joseph Lancaster's plan. By 1833, the school was teaching English, arithmetic, geography, and geometry to about two hundred children, for each of whom a charge of a penny a week was made. The annual expenditure was about ¬£100, and income from endowments was ¬£47.17s, with the balance being made up by voluntary contributions. At that time, \\"Matravers's School\\" was one of the largest and most advanced in Wiltshire for the children of working people. The school's first home was in Bratton Road, in a building later called the Old Athenaeum.\\"Westbury: Schools\\", in A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 8, Warminster, Westbury and Whorwellsdown Hundreds (Victoria County History, London, 1965), pp 188-191 In 1844 a single schoolroom was built in Lower Road (now Leigh Road) for teaching girls separately, and by 1859 the new school there had about seventy girls. The boys continued in the original school, and both were affiliated with the British and Foreign School Society, being thus called \\"British Schools\\". In 1874 the Westbury British Boys' School moved into a room in the new Laverton Institute, and in 1907 its management was transferred to Wiltshire County Council and it became known as the Westbury Laverton Institute School. In 1925 the boys' school was closed, and the girls' school in Lower Road was expanded by two new classrooms to take both girls and boys on the same site, taking the new name of Westbury Senior Council School. In 1930 the school was enlarged again to take in children aged over eleven from Heywood, Chapmanslade, Corsley, Dilton Marsh, Bratton, Edington, and Erlestoke.

It also has an effect on the nature of negotiations for royalties that may be due to artists under Canada's Copyright Act. Background =Exhibition rights under Canadian copyright law= In 1988, the Copyright Act was amended to provide for an exhibition right \\"to present at a public exhibition, for a purpose other than sale or hire, an artistic work created after June 7, 1988, other than a map, chart or plan.\\" Such fees were to be negotiated directly with individual copyright holders or their authorized agents. =Status of the Artist Act= In 1992, the Parliament of Canada passed the Status of the Artist Act (\\"SAA\\"), which provided for Canadian artists to be represented by recognized professional associations in negotiating terms of compensation on their behalf with federal \\"producers\\" who commission artists' services. Accordingly, Canadian Artists' Representation (\\"CARFAC\\") and Regroupement des artistes en arts visuels du Qu√©bec (\\"RAAV\\") have been recognized with respect to rights relating to visual artists. =The case at hand= In 2003, CARFAC and RAAV commenced negotiations with the National Gallery of Canada (\\"NGC\\") in order to establish a scale agreement under the SAA. They sought to include minimum fees for the use of existing works of visual artists. The NGC expressed reservations and stated that they wished to receive legal advice on that issue, but over the next four years proceeded to draft an agreement that included such works. In 2007, the NGC, obtained a legal opinion upon which it relied to state that CARFAC/RAAV did not have the authority to negotiate for such fees, as it did not have written authorization from each artist covered by the agreement. On that basis, the NGC presented a revised draft scale agreement from which all references to existing works were removed. After trying to negotiate further, CARFAC and RAAV filed a complaint with the Canadian Artists and Producers Professional Relations Tribunal that the NGC had breached s. 32 of the SAA by failing to bargain in good faith.SCC, par. 56 The tribunal and court below =Canadian Artists and Producers Professional Relations Tribunal= The Tribunal found in favour of CARFAC and RAAV, ruling that: :* previous decisions by the Tribunal had recognized that scale agreements can include minimum fees for the use of existing works, and inclusion of copyright matters has become standard in the cultural sector;CAPPRT, par. 99 :* the SAA complements and supplements the Copyright Act, and that artists' associations can negotiate scale agreements under the SAA provided that those agreements do not bind collective societies established under the Copyright Act;CAPPRT, par. 103 :* under Royal Oak Mines, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that if a party proposes a clause in a collective agreement, or conversely, refuses even to discuss a basic or standard term, that is acceptable and included in other collective agreements in comparable industries throughout the country, a labour board may find that the party is not making \\"every reasonable effort to enter into a collective agreement\\".CAPPRT, par. 119, citing Royal Oak Mines, par. XLV :* NGC had violated s. 32 of the SAA by failing to bargain in good faith;CAPPRT, par. 147152 and :* NGC was ordered to comply with the SAA, establish a bargaining schedule with CARFAC/RAAV and provide monthly reports to the Tribunal.CAPPRT, par. 171173 =Federal Court of Appeal= In a 2-1 decision, the Tribunal's order was set aside. In the majority ruling No√´l JA stated: :* neither the Supreme Court in Desputeaux nor the Copyright Act recognize an artist association's right to interfere in transactions affecting copyrights held by its members;FCA, par. 96 :* the Tribunal distorted the words used by Parliament, by asserting that the assignment of a copyright is a \\"provision of artists' services\\" under the SAA;FCA, par. 102 and :* in consequence, matters relating to copyright do not fall under the SAA, and the Tribunal had no authority to compel the parties to negotiate such matters, so the NGC could not be said to be failing to negotiate in good faith.FCA, par. 115 In dissent, Pelletier JA argued that granting a producer the right to use an existing work was similar to the service provided by hotels and car rental agencies by allowing others to use their property,FCA, par. 83 and therefore the Tribunal's interpretation of \\"provision of services\\" was reasonable.FCA, par. 86 Because scale agreements do not apply to works for which the copyright has been assigned to a collective society, but rather only where the artist alone has the right to grant licences to use his or her work, there was no conflict between the two Acts.FCA, par. 87 Applying Royal Oak Mines, he concluded that an objective assessment supported the Tribunal's finding that the NGC had negotiated in bad faith.FCA, par. 7176 At the Supreme Court =Immediate decision= In a rare move, judgment was given immediately after the hearing. McLachlin CJ declared: =Reasons given= In a unanimous decision, Rothstein J held that: :* where a tribunal is interpreting its home statute or statutes closely connected to its function, courts must interpret the question of jurisdiction narrowly;SCC, par. 13, citing :* the Tribunal's conclusion that the \\"provision of artists' services\\" includes assigning or licensing a copyright was reasonable,SCC, par. 1519 and the two Acts in question do not conflict;SCC, par. 2025 and :* the Tribunal's finding of fact that the NGC failed to bargain in good faith was not unreasonable, and, under Khosa, it was not for courts to reweigh the evidence considered by it.SCC, par. 30, citing Impact Following the initial decision, the National Gallery issued a press release, announcing: Before the Supreme Court issued its ruling, concern was expressed as to whether the parties would have fared better if they had continued negotiations, as well as pointing out that a ruling in CARFAC/RAAV's favour would be expensive for the NGC and other galleries across the country. As well, it will also have serious implications for more obscure artists who may want to waive their minimum fee and negotiate freely with the gallery.

Moving food and liquids from the mouth into the stomach through a set of coordinated muscle movements of the mouth larynx, pharynx and the esophagus 2. Protecting the airway to prevent food and liquids from entering the lungs.Zamir Z, Ren J, Hogan W, Shaker R. Coordination of deglutitive vocal cord closure and oral- pharyngeal swallowing events in the elderly. European J Gastro Hepatol 1996; 8: 425-429. This natural process of swallowing can be disrupted in many ways. The problem can occur when the movements involved in swallowing are restricted due to a tumor, any type of blockage, or paralysis after a stroke. Besides the motor problems, swallowing can be impaired due to sensory dysfunction, meaning when sensation (the ability to feel) is lost or reduced anywhere in the throat area. The loss of sensation can be caused by a problem originating in the brain, such as what happens after certain types of stroke, or it can be a result of a nerve injury or swelling in the actual throat area. FEESST is the only test currently available which can identify if there is any loss of sensation in the throat area. Before FEESST was invented, all tests of swallowing, be they X-ray based tests (Modified Barium Swallow (MBS)Brady S, Donzelli J. The modified barium swallow and the functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. Otolaryngol Clin North Am. 2013 Dec;46(6):1009-22 or endoscopy-based tests (Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)Logemann, J.

Videoendoscopic evaluation of patients with dysphagia: An adjunct to modified barium swallow. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1991; 104: 339-350. solely looked at the motor component of swallowing without examining the sensory aspect of a swallow or the ability to feel.  Technique  FEESST is an outpatient procedure involving the passing of a thin flexible scope through the nose to the pharynx. The exam consisting of two parts. First part assesses sensation in the pharynx and airway protection. The airway protection is assessed by sending air-pulses to the throat area that is innervated by the vagus nerve, which is the region of the throat between the top of the vocal folds to the tip of the epiglottis in order to stimulate an airway protective reflex called the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR). This reflex, which occurs when the tissues of the throat are stimulated, causes the vocal folds to close in order to protect the airway from food going into the lungs. Since the windpipe (trachea) is located so close to the food-pipe (esophagus) this is a critical reflex to be functioning well at all times. Stimulation of this reflex not only results in protection of the airway, it also initiates a swallow. When a swallow is initiated the larynx rises up to two inches, going further away from the esophagus, thereby acting as an additional cover for the airway. During the air pulse administration part of the test it is determined if the reflex (LAR) that initiates the swallow is being responsive enough. The responsiveness depends on the ability of the vagus nerve to feel so that it can properly send the impulse to the brain to initiate the LAR. If there is any injury or swelling of the vagus nerve, the sensation will be diminished. As a result, the reflex responsible for protecting the airway will be affected. During sensory testing it has been shown that a much stronger stimulus is necessary to elicit the LAR if there is any desensitization to the vagus nerve. The second part of the FEESST test involves giving food to the patient and tracking where the food travels in the throat region. Green food coloring is typically given in the food to track the food as it travels along the natural pink-colored tissues of the throat. If the food that is given is seen to stick to on one side of the throat, which is called food ‚Äúresidue‚Äù, that usually means that there is lack of sensation or possibly even a motor/movement problem on that particular side of the throat. The treatment for this discovered throat numbness is to then teach the patient to turn their head to the numb side of their throat when they swallow. This maneuver, called a \\"head turn\\" effectively closes off the numb side of the throat so when they swallow the food is only exposed to the normal side of the throat, thereby insuring a safer swallow (on the normal side there is no residue so there is no chance of the residue accidentally falling into the vocal folds and then into the lungs (aspiration). = Vagus Nerve Injury = When there is damage to the nerve that innervates the throat, the vagus nerve, both motor and sensory function can be affected since the vagus contains both motor and sensory nerve fibers. However, until sensory testing was developed there was no way to assess sensory loss from a vagus nerve injury. One of the most common symptoms of a vagus nerve injury is chronic cough. If a physician looked into the vocal cords of a patient with chronic cough it would appear they are opening and closing normally, however if sensory testing was performed it would give abnormal results thus indicating that the sensory nerve fibers of the vagus were somehow damaged. This would allow for a more precise diagnosis and treatment.Cukier-Blaj S, Bewley A, Aviv JE, Murry T. Paradoxical vocal fold motion: a sensory-motor laryngeal disorder. Laryngoscope 2008; 118:367-70.Aviv JE, Murry T. Sensory Testing Alone. In: Aviv JE, Murry T, eds. FEESST: Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory Testing.

The Mysteries and Dangers of Acid Reflux and Its Connection to America‚Äôs Fastest Growing Cancer with a Diet That May Save Your Life. North Charleston, SC: Create Space Independent Publishing Platform 2014: 23-33. Another clinical situation where assessment of laryngeal sensation is helpful is in patients complaining of throat pain. Again, when examining the throat of such patients, if everything seemed to be moving well, then clinicians are often befuddled as to what the source of the throat pain is. With sensory testing, one can demonstrate that the throat tissues are numb, signifying some damage to the sensory fibers of the vagus and thereby identify vagus nerve injury as the cause of the patient's pain. This is called vagus nerve neuralgia and treatment for neuralgia can then commence. One always sensory tests both the right and left sides of throat and the sensory levels should be symmetric, that is, the right side of the throat should normally equal the left side. However, if during sensory testing it is determined that one side is normal and the other side has a sensory deficit, then likely something has injured the vagus nerve somewhere along it lengthy course from the brain into the neck. As a result, when there is asymmetric sensory nerve loss, imaging of the neck and brain must be done to see where along the course of the vagus nerve a blockage or injury might have taken place.Aviv JE, Murry T.

Cummings Otolaryngology Head And Neck Surgery, 5th Edition, Philadelphia PA, Elsevier Mosby; 2009: 894-903.  Indications For Sensory Testing of The Throat  = Acid Reflux Disease = Over the past 20 years, primarily due to work with sensory testing performed by gastroenterologists (stomach doctors) and pulmonologists (lung doctors), sensory testing and FEESST have been shown to have additional applications beyond assessing swallowing function. For example, people with acid reflux disease, especially those with Throatburn Reflux usually have swollen vocal cords due to years of acid damage. Untreated acid-injured vocal cords will not have as sharp reflexes as vocal cords that are not swollen. Therefore, aspiration is common in people with chronic acid reflux disease. Sensory testing can quantify and assess the swelling for better treatment. The strength of the air pulse given during sensory testing in acid-injured vocal cords due to acid reflux disease will necessarily be much greater in order to elicit an airway reflex than tissues that are not swollen.Phua SY, McGarvey LPA, Ngu MC, Ing AJ.

The estate traces its history back to the 13th century. The current main building dates from 1576 but was renovated in the Baroque style in 1734. The estate has been owned by the Scheel-Plessen family since 1721 but the recently restored main building and its immediate surroundings have been ceded to a self-owning foundation. The building is now operated as a museum and is also used as a venue for concerts and other events. The knight's hall is decorated with paintings by Hendrick Krock. The main building, a gatehouse from 1734 and the east wing of the adjacent home farm (Avlsg√•rden) were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. History =Early history= Andreas von Barby Sels√∏ is first mentioned in 1288 when bishop Ingvar of Roskilde granted it to Jens Grand for life. On Grand's death in 1300, Sels√∏ reverted to the Bishopric of Roskilde. The original Sels√∏ was probably a defensive building located close to Sels√∏ Church, overlooking the lake which was then part of Roskilde Fjord. Sels√∏ was together with other property of the Catholic Church confiscated by the Crown during the Reformation. In 1756, Christian III ceded the estate to Andreas von Barby, one of his favourites, who had already been granted a number of fiefs. Barby was the following year granted royal permission to turn the estate into a stamhus for his nephew Hans von Barby. Hans von Barby had no interest in the Danish estate and sold it when his uncle died two years later. =Ulfeldt family= Corfitz Knudsen Ulfeldt The new owner of the estate was Corfitz Knudsen Ulfeldt. He was already the owner of Ulfeldtsholm at Nyborg on the island of Funen and had also been granted a number of royal fiefs. He was now also granted Eskilds√∏ in Roskilde Fjord, initially as a fief but after a while as his property in exchange for other land. Sels√∏ as Johann Gottfried Burman Becker believed it appeared in 1588 In 1562, Ulfeldt was sent by the king on a diplomatic mission to Stockholm. He fell seriously ill on the way home, and died at Hiller√∏dsholm in 1563. He had never married, and Sels√∏ and his other estates were therefore passed to his brother Jacob Ulfeldt. The Sels√∏ estate comprised 50 farms, six village houses without land, a windmill and a watermill. Jacob Ulfeldt completed a new main building in 1576, using half a million bricks from the abandoned St. Clare's Priory in Roskilde. The new building was apparently designed by a Dutch architect, most likely Hans Hendrik van Paesschen (c. 1510-1582). After Jacob Ulfeldt's death, Sels√∏ was handed down to his son Mogens Ulfeldt. He was appointed as Admiral of the Realm in 1610. An action committed by his wife, Anne Munk, prompted him with the king's permission to imprison her at Sels√∏ and her full freedom was not restored until 1624. On Mogens Ulfeldt's death in 1616, Sels√∏ was handed down to their four children. =Cganging owners, 1624-1720= Nobiliss ac Generosiss ... Ernestus Norman In 1624, King Christian IV wrote to the three Ulfeldt brothers, encouraging them to travel abroad. In order to cover travel expenses, they had to sell Sels√∏. The buyer was Ernst Normand, Christian IV's former servant, who had already acquired the estate Palsg√•rd in Jutland through his marriage to Ingeborg Arenfeldt. On his widow's death, Pelsgaard was passed down to their daughter while Sels√∏ was sold to Joachim Frederik Pentz. Berte Skeel in 1669, Sels√∏ was ceded by Pentz to Erik Krag in exchange for √Östrup in Jutland. He was a major landowner, but lost most of his fortune though speculation. In 1682, Sels√∏ was acquired by the enterprising noble lady Berte Skeel. She was also the owner of a town mansion on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. She administrated the estate with great skill for the next almost four decades. She also acquired the right of patronage of Skuldelev Church. =Scheel-Plessen family= Christian Ludvig von Plessen Om 1821, Sels√∏ was purchased by Christian Ludvig Scheel von Plessen (1702‚Äì1752), one of the country's most prosperous landowners. From 1728 to 1734, the Renaissance manor was adapted to the Baroque style and has not been substantially altered since. In 1728, Plessen also purchased the nearby manor of Lindholm. By testament, Plessen created a Fideikommis from the estate with the effect that it could neither be sold or divided between heirs. After Christian Ludvig Scheel von Plessen's death in 1752, Sels√∏ and Lindholm were handed down to his grandson Christian Ludvig Scheel-Plessen. In 1829, the last occupant of the property, Agathe von Qualen, Christian Ludvig Scheel von Plessen's widow, died. As her heirs were not interested in the estate, the manor's furniture was auctioned off and the house was left unattended for 144 years. The building soon fell into a sorry state as uninvited visitors plundered its remaining assets. Even the magnificent reception hall was used as storage space for corn. Salvation came in 1972 when the writers Grethe and Bernhard Linder initiated the manor's restoration. The restoration work was successfully conducted over the following 25 years, earning them wide recognition including the Europa Nostra award. Known as the Sels√∏-Lindholm estate (Sels√∏-Lindholm Gods), the property now belongs to the Plessenske Sels√∏ Foundation (Den Plessenske Sels√∏ Fond). Architecture The main building is a simple two-storey building constructed in red brick. The roof is clad with red tiles. The gatehouse is from 1734. Today The manor is operated as a museum by the Pklessenske Sels√∏ Fond. It is open to visitors from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day except Monday from May to mid-September.

Biography Dan Chamizer was born in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine. He grew up in Ramat Gan. His father, Emmanuel Chamizer, was killed during the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war in battle for Nitzanim.Emanuel Chamizer in Izcor Memorial site. His grandfather was the physician and sculptor Raphael Chamizer. Chamizer holds an MA in Social Sciences from Tel Aviv University (1978). His MA thesis dealt with the impact of environmental and human factors on pilot error.Ein Hod: A Unique Village in Israel , Emunah Chamizer lives in Ein Hod, an artists village at the foot of the Carmel mountains in northern Israel. His son Giora is an Israeli television producer. Aviation career  During his military service, Chamizer was a helicopter pilot. After discharge from the Israel Defense Forces, he became a commercial pilot with Arkia Airlines and a pioneer in Israel's fledgling micro-aviation industry. Media career Dan Chamizer and son Giora Chamizer was a newspaper columnist, radio presenter for Galei Tsahal and a TV host. With Zeev Aner, he produced hundreds of nationwide treasure hunt games. He had a daily spot on Razi Barkai and Shelly Yachimovich's radio show, \\"Hakol Diburim\\" (1990-1997). The show was broadcast on the Reshet Bet radio channel, where Chamizer presented a featured item called \\"Chidat Chamizer\\" (Chamizer's riddle). His riddles were based on imagination and associative thinking rather than general knowledge. The riddles proved challenging to solve and required ‚Äòentering the mind‚Äô of Chamizer to identify and decoding his personal associations. The prize for solving the riddles increased every day and often amounted to substantial sums of money, thus attracting a large audience. In its seven years on air, the percentage share of listeners increased to 17%, making him one of the most innovative contributors in radio. Chamizer went on to produce TV game shows, including \\"Otzar Hanegev\\", \\"Yemei Eden BaGalil\\", \\"Yovel La‚ÄôMedina\\", \\"Treasures of One Hundred Years of Zionism\\", \\"Treasures of World Cup Football\\", \\"Treasures of Israel at 60\\". He returned to radio in 2004 with a new game show called The \\"Chamizer Sentence\\", which offered the highest individual prize awarded in the history of Israeli radio game shows- NIS 240,000. In 2009, Chamizer produced the VOD Treasure for HOT TV, and in 2010, he produced The Treasure of the Century, celebrating 100 years of the Kibbutz Movement in Israel, followed by the New Israel Defense Force Quiz in 2011. Local culture For decades Chamizer inspired Israelis to connect en-masse with opportunities for informal study via riddles, puzzles, games, nationwide treasure hunts and innovative educational projects. His surname ‚Äì Chamizer ‚Äì has become synonymous among Israelis with any riddle or intellectual challenge that requires wit, imagination and creativity to solve, and it has entered Hebrew slang as a verb, often conjugated playfully to describe the solving of sophisticated riddles.  Educational projects  Diploma for completion of Chamizer riddle course Chamizer developed the \\"Teaching through Riddles\\" educational method, where imaginative-associative riddles characterized by playful wit, wild leaps of imagination and outlandish word association became part of the approved national teaching curriculum in Israeli schools. To date, over half a million students have taken an active part in projects based around Chamizer riddles. Chamizer sees his riddles as tools for encouraging inventive thinking. He explains the purpose of the method as follows: \\"The imaginative-associative riddle, like many of life‚Äôs problems, has endless solutions. Therefore, finding the correct approach to solving one, offers a perfect simulation for other life challenges that demand a creative input.\\"Dan Chamizer explains imaginative riddle in education The method lends legitimacy to unconventional thinking and unmediated means, stimulating curiosity, creativity, enthusiasm and competitiveness. The coveted cash prize goes to the player who manages to \\"enter the riddler‚Äôs head,\\" but much credit is also given for improvisation, initiative, creative thinking, teamwork, leadership, focus, openness, self-confidence and courage ‚Äì and these are the qualities that truly matter. In his words: \\"My aim is to instill an alternative way of acquiring study skills and assimilating knowledge.\\" In 2010, Chamizer established the National Riddle Archive, National Riddles Archive a dynamic online database of imaginative-associative riddles) in association with The Kibbutzim College of Education and the Teachers' Union in Israel. Designed to be used as a teaching resource, facilitating both formal and informal learning, the archive is aimed at professional educators and linked to study topics outlined in the national curriculum. Examples of projects using the ‚ÄòChamizer education method‚Äô: * An online project that allows every participating teacher in Israel to select and receive relevant associative riddles with which to engage their pupils (launched 2015). * An annual national initiative that motivates school pupils in Israel to recognize ‚Äì in a playful, unmediated way ‚Äì the importance of lifestyle in fostering a healthy heart (Hebrew and Arabic). * A Haifa-based educational initiative, not only connecting pupils and parents to their own neighborhoods and communities, but also illuminating their shared past and introducing them to other educational establishments in their area (launched 2015, in Hebrew and Arabic) * A two- year nationwide project intended to facilitate an understanding of the legacy of Israel's former leaders among Israeli schoolchildren (launched 2013)Israel Leaders Legacy 2015. * A national project aimed at promoting opportunities for greater exposure to the culture and heritage of Ethiopian Jewry among the wider school population in Israel.

Quartavious Davis is a United States federal legal case that challenged the use in a criminal trial of location data obtained without a search warrant from MetroPCS, a cell phone service provider. Mobile phone tracking data had helped place the defendant in this case at the scene of several crimes, for which he was convicted. The defendant appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which found the warrantless data collection had violated his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but declined to order a new trial because the evidence was collected in good faith. The Eleventh Circuit has since vacated this decision pending a rehearing by the Eleventh Circuit en banc. United States v. Davis, 573 Fed. Appx. 925 (11th Cir. 2014). On 5 May 2015, the en banc order upheld the use of the information. On 9th Nov 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear this case on appeal. Quartavious [sic] Davis, on trial with five co-defendants, was convicted on several counts of Hobbs Act robbery, conspiracy, and knowing possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and sentenced to over 161 years in prison. He appealed on several grounds, principally arguing that the court admitted stored cell site location information obtained without a warrant, in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The government had obtained the data under a provision of the Stored Communications Act that only requires showing \\"that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the... records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\\" (). That provision does not require showing probable cause, which would have been needed for a warrant. Eleventh Circuit ruling The Circuit Court largely relied on precedent set in Smith v. Maryland and U.S. v. Miller, which established the Third Party Doctrine. By relying on this precedent, the court said that David had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his Cell Site Location Data, as it did not meet the two questions put forth in Katz to establish reasonable expectation. First, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable? Contains a provision that allows for the collection of data like that used in this case via a special court order, often referred to as a \\"D-order\\". These orders allow for the collection of more data than a subpoena would, but less than a warrant. As a tradeoff, these \\"D-orders\\" require less than probable cause to obtain. Because of its perceived similarity to Miller and Smith, the court declared, \\"Based on the SCA and governing Supreme Court precedent, we too conclude the government's obtaining a ¬ß 2703(d) court order for the production of MetroPCS's business records did not violate the Fourth Amendment\\" and \\"Davis can assert neither ownership nor possession of the third-party's business records he sought to suppress\\". Background Typical cell site antennas Cellular telephones make optimal use of limited radio spectrum and their short transmission range, due to low power, by always connecting to a radio antenna at a nearby facility, known as a cell site. These facilities are typically on a tower or tall building and the cellular service provider places many such cell sites in an urban area to cover the needs of its customers. As a cell phone caller moves, their connection is automatically handed-off to another cell site that is close by, as needed. Even when a call is not in progress, each cell phone reports changes in location to allow incoming calls to be routed to it. Service providers record each site a user connects with, along with the time of connection. This information can be used to track a cell phone user's movements throughout the day. as well.(p. 18) The government attempted to distinguish cell phone tracking by pointing out that it has long been established that telephone users do not have an expectation of privacy in the numbers they call. The 11th Circuit noted that while phone users realize they are giving the phone company the number of the person that they are calling, they are not generally aware that they are being tracked. In support it cited an argument made by the prosecutor to the jury that the defendants \\"probably had no idea that by bringing their cell phones with them to these robberies, they were allowing [their cell service provider] and now all of you to follow their movements on the days and at the times of the robberies... \\"(p. 22) The 11th Circuit held \\"that cell site location information is within the subscriber's reasonable expectation of privacy.

Institution The Defence Force Merit Medal was instituted by the State President of Bophuthatswana in 1982. It is the middle award of a set of three decorations for merit, along with the Defence Force Merit Decoration and the Defence Force Commendation Medal. Bophuthatswana's military decorations and medals were modeled on those of the Republic of South Africa and these three decorations are the approximate equivalents of, respectively, the Southern Cross Decoration and Pro Merito Decoration, the Southern Cross Medal (1975) and Pro Merito Medal (1975), and the Military Merit Medal. Award criteria The medal could be awarded to all ranks for extraordinarily excellent service and particular devotion to duty. Order of wear Since the Defence Force Merit Medal was authorised for wear by one of the statutory forces which came to be part of the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994, it was accorded a position in the official South African order of precedence on that date.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 ;Bophuthatswana Defence Force until 26 April 1994: Distinguished Gallantry Medal Defence Force Merit Medal Marumo Medal, Class I *Official BDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Distinguished Gallantry Medal. ** Succeeded by the Marumo Medal, Class I. *Bophuthatswana official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Medal for Valour in the Prisons Service. ** Succeeded by the Medal for Merit in the Prisons Service. ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM) Defence Force Merit Medal Sandile Medal (SM) *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM) of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Sandile Medal (SM) of the Republic of Ciskei. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the National Intelligence Service Decoration, Silver of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Medal for Merit in the Prisons Service of the Republic of Bophuthatswana.

In 2014, Teachout ran for the Democratic Party nomination for governor of New York and lost to incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo, receiving 34% of the primary vote. In 2016, Teachout was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in New York's 19th congressional district. Teachout won the Democratic primary before losing to Republican John Faso. In 2018, Teachout was a candidate for New York State attorney general in the 2018 elections but lost the Democratic nomination to Letitia James. Her candidacy was endorsed by The New York Times. Early life and education Teachout was born in Seattle, Washington, the second of five children, to Peter Teachout, a constitutional law professor at Vermont Law School, and Mary Miles Teachout, who serves as a trial level judge in Vermont. Her father served in the United States Army as a lieutenant during the Vietnam War and has a law degree from Harvard Law School. At the time of her birth, the family was living in Seattle, where her father was a professor at the University of Washington. Raised on a farm outside Norwich, Vermont, Teachout attended Hanover High School in Hanover, New Hampshire, where she was a champion cross-country runner and did some acting. In 1993, Teachout received a B.A. degree from Yale University, where she also did some acting. In 1999, she earned two simultaneous degrees from Duke University: a Juris Doctor, summa cum laude, and an Master of Arts degree in political science. She was also editor-in- chief of the Duke Law Journal. Career After graduating from law school, Teachout clerked for Chief Judge Edward Roy Becker of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. She served as the Director of Internet Organizing for the 2004 Howard Dean presidential campaign. In 2009 she helped found the Antitrust League. She was the first national director of the Sunlight Foundation, which promotes transparency and accountability in government. She has been a professor at Fordham Law School since 2009. She was a visiting professor of law at Duke University in 2007 and a lecturer at the University of Vermont. =Actor= Teachout is also an actor who has performed in many plays at the Unadilla Theatre in Marshfield, Vermont, directed by Bill Blachly, appearing as Katherine in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost in 1994 and as Imogen in Shakespeare's Cymbeline in 1995. She played Winnie in Samuel Beckett's Happy Days in 2012 and 2019. In 2013, Teachout was Lady Utterwood in George Bernard Shaw's Heartbreak House. In 2019, she played Anne in Florian Zeller's 2012 play The Father. =Public affairs= In August 2015, Teachout became CEO and board chair of the campaign finance reform-oriented organization Mayday PAC, replacing Lawrence Lessig. She stepped down from this position in December 2015 to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York's 19th congressional district. Teachout volunteered at Occupy Wall Street, where she encouraged the movement to focus on the importance of decentralized power, citing the ideas of James Madison, and worked to educate activists in corporate law and policy. In January 2017, Teachout joined the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington's lawsuit against President Trump, alleging violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause. As of May 2018, she served on the board of advisors of Let America Vote, an organization founded by former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander that aims to end voter suppression. In October of that year she was appointed to the editorial board of The Nation. =2014 New York gubernatorial campaign= Teachout shaking hands with National Writers Union (UAW Local 1981) president Larry Goldbetter at the \\"We Will Not Go Back\\" march and rally held on August 23, 2014. Teachout faced off against incumbent Andrew Cuomo and comedian Randy Credico in the Democratic primary election on September 9, 2014. In July 2014, the Board of Elections received objections from Harris Weiss and Austin Sternlicht challenging Teachout's New York residency. She first ran for the Working Families Party nomination, but lost to Cuomo. His margin of victory was much smaller than expected, especially since the Working Families Party traditionally cross-endorses the Democratic Party candidate. Teachout then announced that she would run for the Democratic nomination. Her running mate was Tim Wu, a Columbia University Law School professor who coined the phrase \\"net neutrality\\".Wu, Tim, \\"Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination\\", freepress.net, April 23, 2005. Their platform called for a rollback of Cuomo's tax cuts for the wealthy, investment in transportation and broadband infrastructure, a statewide fracking ban, an end to high-stakes testing and fair funding for schools in both under-resourced and affluent school districts, restoring voting rights to convicted felons, and support for the NY DREAM Act and anti-corruption measures, including public financing of elections to reduce the power of corporate donors and affluent political insiders. Their campaign raised $800,000, a small amount for New York state politics. Four days before the primary, polls showed their likely voter share at 26%, in line with the predictions of political professionals. Teachout and Wu lost to Cuomo and his running mate, former U.S. Representative Kathy Hochul, in the primary on September 9, 2014. =2016 U.S. House campaign= In March 2015, Teachout moved from Brooklyn to Dutchess County, New York. Ten months later she announced her candidacy in New York's 19th congressional district's 2016 Democratic congressional primary. She ran to replace Republican Chris Gibson, who was retiring. In the June 28 primary Teachout won the nomination. She was endorsed by U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Chuck Schumer, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, the National Education Association, New York State United Teachers, National Nurses United, the Communication Workers of America, EMILY's List, and the Sierra Club. She lost to Republican John Faso in the November 8 general election by nine percentage points. =2018 Attorney General campaign= Teachout served as treasurer for Cynthia Nixon's campaign for governor of New York until May 2018, when she announced she was running for attorney general of New York in the 2018 election. At the time Teachout was pregnant, expecting a child in October, one month after the primary and one month before the general election. On August 19, 2018, The New York Times endorsed Teachout for state attorney general. Its editorial board members argued that she would be the ideal candidate to hold both President Trump as well as the state government to account. On September 13, 2018, Teachout lost the Democratic primary for Attorney General to Letitia James, receiving 31% of the vote to James's 40.6%. Political views Teachout was among the minority of Democratic congressional candidates who endorsed Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. She was also among the first candidates Sanders endorsed. He subsequently endorsed her for attorney general of New York in 2018, and Teachout has endorsed him in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. In a January 2020 opinion column in The Guardian, Teachout wrote that Sanders's Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden had \\"a big corruption problem\\" arising from his relationships with donors over the course of his Senate career. Sanders apologized to Biden for the article, saying, \\"It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way.\\" Teachout's platform for her House campaign included a higher minimum wage, increased spending on public infrastructure, a ban on fracking, an increase in manufacturing jobs, property tax cuts, increased investment in rural infrastructure, an end to Common Core and high-stakes testing, and campaign finance reform (specifically working to overturn Citizens United v. FEC). While running for Attorney General of New York, Teachout pledged that she would use the power of the office to sue Trump for violating anti-corruption laws and to force him to divest from his businesses. Electoral history Personal life and family Teachout is married to Nicholas S. Juliusburger, a software company executive. They live in Clinton, New York. Zephyr's siblings are Woden, Chelsea, Dillon, and Cabot. Zephyr's older sister, Woden, has a PhD in American history from Harvard and has taught at Middlebury College. Her younger sister Chelsea is a Boston trial attorney. Dillon Teachout, the fourth-born daughter, is a social worker in Maple Corner. And Cabot, the youngest sibling and only son, is a Norwich criminal defense lawyer. In October 2018, Teachout and Juliusburger were expecting their first child. Teachout used footage of her receiving an ultrasound in a campaign advertisement.

Pitts Jr. is an American lawyer and politician. He served as the Mayor of Fayetteville, North Carolina, for two terms from 2001 until 2005. Pitts was the city's first African-American mayor. Biography Pitts attended Westover High School in Fayetteville, where he was a member of school's track team. He graduated from the North Carolina Central University School of Law in 1990. =Political career= Pitts first ran for a seat on the Fayetteville City Council in 1997, but lost the election by only 66 votes. However, he staged a comeback and won election to a city council at-large seat in 1999, becoming the first African-American elected to city council in twenty years. In 2001, Pitts ran for Mayor of Fayetteville against incumbent Mayor Milo McBryde. McBryde, a third generation member of a prominent Fayetteville political family, had served on the city council for twenty-two years on the city council at the time. McBryde had been appointed as Mayor of Fayetteville in August 2000 following the death of longtime Mayor J.L. Dawkins, who died in office. Pitts' 2001 campaign slogan was \\"Change Is Coming.\\" Pitts defeated McBryde in the mayoral election held on November 6, 2001. He earned approximately 56% of the vote (11,405 votes), while incumbent Mayor McBryde placed second with 44% (8,979 votes). Pitts was sworn into office on December 3, 2001, becoming the city's first African-American mayor. He was re-elected to a second term in a mayoral runoff election held on November 4, 2003. Pitts easily defeated his opponent, real estate agent Robert Anderson, in the 2003 runoff. Pitts' 2003 slogan was \\"Change Is Now.\\" Under Pitts' second term, areas of adjacent Cumberland County, North Carolina, were annexed into Fayetteville, adding approximately 43,000 new residents to the city's population. Pitts was defeated for re-election on November 8, 2005, by Tony Chavonne. Chavonne received around 55% of the vote in 2005. The annexations of new areas into Fayetteville seemed to play a pivotal role in the election. Chavonne overwhelmingly defeated Pitts in the newly annexed areas of the city.

Cited in Cherry, 2001.\\"a gentleman of the fire-office\\" mentioned in John Bagford, A letter to the publisher, in the preface to Thomas Hearne's edition of Leland's Collectanea, 1715. Bagford, a print collector, was interested solely in the map of London printed in the New View, which he identified as a version of Braun & Hogenberg's map of 1573. who wrote A New View of London: or, an Ample Account of that City, in Two Volumes, or Eight Sections. &c.;, published anonymously in two octavo volumes 1708. The New View is an important reference to the streets, life and buildings of London not long after the Great Fire of London, 1666. A New View of London The New View was apparently prepared mainly in the 1680s and 90s and by the time it was published in 1708 a supplement was necessary to bring it up to date. It contained one map and a small number of illustrations. In the preface, Hatton acknowledged the debt that his work owed to John Stow's A Survey of London (1598), saying \\"If it be objected, that I have taken several things from Mr. Stow, I own the truth thereof\\" but stating the necessity for his new work on the grounds that the \\"devouring flames\\" of the Great Fire had \\"made such vast Alterations, that what was London in Mr. Stow's time, is now like another City.\\"\\"Preface\\" in Hatton, Edward. (1708) A New View of London. London. The New View commences with an introduction to the government of London, past and present, followed by eight sections, each arranged alphabetically:Hatton, Edward. (1708) A New View of London. London. *I. A 92-page street directory. *II. A history of over 100 churches and chapels in nearly 500 pages. *III. Descriptions of the livery companies of London, customs houses, the Bank of England etc. *IV. Palaces and houses of the nobility. The Houses of Parliament and notable Halls. *V. Colleges, libraries, museums, free schools and courts etc. *VI. Hospitals, prisons, workhouses, houses of correction, almshouses, charity schools. *VII. Fountains, bridges, conduits, ferries, docks, keys, wharfs. *VIII. Public statues. Hatton states that the inspiration for his own work was a pocket guide to Paris. This may have been the Description de Paris, by Germain Brice, first published 1681, which received an English translation in 1685. The New View went far beyond a simple street directory, as may be seen from the contents list, and it included details such as the colour of lawyers robes, the weekly rations of children in the workhouse and the costs and times of delivery of letters. These turned it into an early example of a vade mecum and a virtual encyclopaedia of London life. The work was published anonymously, though Hatton's contemporaries and rivals were aware of its authorship, and this may have been because of Hatton's relatively modest origins. Unlike rivals like John Strype, Hatton did not move in antiquarian circles and the work might have been more acceptable anonymously than from someone of Hatton's position. Rivals to the New View In 1702, John Strype, had been approached by two of the publishers of the unsuccessful plan to produce an updated edition of Stow's Survey. This new edition was apparently ready by November 1707, but booksellers were not interested in stocking it, due to the publication of Hatton's slimmer and cheaper book. Strype's A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster was eventually published in 1720. His antiquarian associates blamed the delay on an \\"unskillful writing master\\", presumably Hatton, who had stolen the market, but Strype's own slow progress in completing his work may also have played a part in the delay. Strype did refer his readers to Hatton, but on more recent subjects and therefore possibly matters below him as an antiquarian. Professional activity A plate from Hatton's The Merchant's Magazine or Tradesman's Treasury The work of professional surveyors developed greatly after the Great Fire and often included related and ancillary activities. Some taught mathematics, calling themselves \\"philomath\\", as Hatton did.\\"E. Hatton, Philomath\\" pictured by W. Sherwin in An Index to Interest, 1711. Hatton published a book titled The Merchant's Magazine or Tradesman's Treasury (author \\"E. Hatton Gent\\". The work was intended as a primer in good business practice and subjects covered included arithmetic, book-keeping, trading practices and model business letters. Imaginary correspondents included Nicholas Needum, Lazarus Lackcash and Dives Doubledun. Also included were nine sample plates of penmanship relating to the rules of arithmetic. Later, Hatton was a subscriber to works on surveying and mathematics. Personal life Hatton was most likely the \\"Hatton, Edward of St. Andrew, Holborn, bachelor, 29\\" who received a licence to marry \\"Sarah Mainwaring spinster, 19, daughter of Thomas Mainwaring of St. Dunstan-in-the-West, goldsmith, who consents, at St. Austin, London. 3 Oct. 1693\\".Foster, Joseph.

As the program's introduction said, The Saint (the alias of Simon Templar), was \\"known to millions from books, magazines, and motion pictures.\\"Terrace, Vincent (1981), Radio's Golden Years: The Encyclopedia of Radio Programs 1930-1960\\\\. A.S. Barnes & Company, Inc. . Pp. 230-231. Several versions of the program appeared on different networks. Broadcast history The Saint began its life on radio in January 1945. Most old time radio reference books list the initial broadcast date as January 6, 1945, probably because that was when the program aired in the Eastern United States. In an initial story about The Saint, however, Billboard reported, \\"Series tees-off over NBC January 4 on 7 Western stations, with a repeat skedded for Saturday to hit 15 Midwestern and Eastern stations at 7:30 p.m. EWT.\\" That Saturday was January 6. The article noted the involvement of the character's creator, saying: \\"All scripting will be under the supervision of Charteris, who will oversee the adaptations of his published works. If any originals are to be done, he'll do them.\\" Edgar Barrier starred, and Bromo-Seltzer was the sponsor. This version ended March 31, 1945. The second iteration of The Saint on radio was a summer replacement for The Jack Carson Show on CBS. It began June 20, 1945, with Billboard reporting in a preview article, \\"There's nothing definite now, but it's expected here that if The Saint pulls an acceptable Hooperating for its 13-week spin, starting June 20, it may stay on the air permanently with Carson out ...\\" Despite that prediction, the program went off when its summer run ended September 12, 1945. Brian Aherne starred, and Campbell Soups was the sponsor. The show's third version, which began July 9, 1947, was limited to CBS' West Coast network. It ended June 30, 1948. The sponsor was Lever Brothers. Vincent Price starred in this version and in most of the show's episodes in the two versions that followed. After a year's hiatus, The Saint returned to radio July 10, 1949‚Äîthis time on Mutual. An announcement in Billboard noted that the program would be sustaining (without a sponsor), but that Mutual \\"will use trial summer run to showcase show for fall bankrolling.\\" The bankrolling eventually came from Ford Motor Company, and the show lasted through May 28, 1950. The program's final run began June 11, 1950, as a summer replacement for The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show. The Saint was back on its original network, NBC, for this version, which ended October 14, 1951. The show lasted longer in this version than in any other, despite a negative review of the first episode in Billboard which said much of the script was \\"confusing and slow-paced\\" and called star Vincent Price \\"frightfully dull.\\" The title role was also played briefly by Tom Conway (whose brother, George Sanders, had played Simon Templar in several films), and Barry Sullivan.Buxton, Frank and Owen, Bill (1972).

It features interviews with key industry professionals, including artists, writers, editors, and retailers, as well as with prominent members of the surrounding fan culture.  Background  She Makes Comics is the fifth co- production between Respect Films and Sequart Organization. The film was directed by Marisa Stotter, who began working with Respect Films during the summer of 2013. Production began in October 2013, with several interviews conducted in the Southern California region. = Kickstarter campaign = On February 3, 2014, Sequart Organization launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the film. Over the 31-day funding period, the campaign raised $54,001, nearly $15,000 more than the initial goal. This surplus allowed the project to announce several stretch goals, including a mini-documentary about the first female African-American cartoonist, Jackie Ormes, that would be a companion to She Makes Comics.  Production  The filmmakers traveled to several cities, including New York and San Diego, to conduct interviews with notable figures in comics. Among the creatives interviewed are writer Kelly Sue DeConnick, X-Men writer Chris Claremont, Elfquest creators Wendy and Richard Pini, artist Becky Cloonan, and Tits & Clits artist Joyce Farmer. The industry professionals interviewed include former executive editor of DC Comics' Vertigo imprint Karen Berger, former president of DC Comics Paul Levitz, former DC publisher Jenette Kahn, Comic-Con International organizer Jackie Estrada, and Comics Beat's Heidi MacDonald. Additional interviews were filmed with various scholars, journalists, entertainers, and prominent members of the fan community.  Release  The film had its festival premiere at the Comic- Con International Film Festival in 2015, where it won the best documentary award. The film was subsequently acquired for distribution by XLRator Media.  Plot  The film traces the history of women in comic books as industry professionals and as fans. It begins with the early days of comics and follows the rise of women in the emerging comic book industry of the 30s and 40s. It tells the story of women's contributions to mainstream comics, featuring such figures as artists Ramona Fradon (who drew for DC Comics) and Marie Severin (who worked at Marvel Comics). The film also focuses on the underground comics movement of the 70s, the rise of women into prominent positions at mainstream publishers in the 80s, and the flourishing of female creators in independent comics and webcomics.

The battle  On June 9, 1876, soldiers and civilians under the command of Brigadier General George R. Crook, were encamped on the Tongue River at the mouth of Prairie Dog Creek. With Crook, were over 950 United States cavalry and infantry soldiers, and about 100 civilians. While the soldiers were in camp on June 9, some observed two mounted Cheyenne warriors riding along the bluffs on the north bank of the Tongue River. Then, about 200 concealed Cheyenne warriors suddenly fired a volley of .44 Henry, and .50 caliber rifles from the bluffs into Crook's camp. Another small band of warriors had remained hidden to the east of Crook's camp, with the intention of stealing the soldiers' horses when their attention was diverted. Crook ordered an attack. Companies C, G, and H, of the 9th U.S. Infantry crossed the river, and after wading through the rivers' frigid water, scaled the nearly vertical bluffs. Companies A, E, I, and M of the Third U.S. Cavalry, the battalion under the command of Captain Anson Mills also responded, and crossed the river just to the west, and on the left flank of the infantrymen. Accompanying the cavalry was the newspaper reporter John F. Finerty, the \\"Fighting Irish Pencil Pusher\\" for the Chicago Times. After reaching a grove of cottonwood trees, the cavalry dismounted. Leaving every fourth man as a horse holder, the cavalrymen advanced dismounted up the bluffs. After reaching the top, the soldiers drove back the Cheyenne warriors who had fired into the camp earlier, north about half a mile, away from the crest of the ridge. But at a second ridge line, the Cheyenne's reformed. Soldiers then drove them from it, crossing into Montana Territory. Warriors reformed a third time, but this final effort lasted only briefly, and the Cheyenne warriors retreated north. The warriors intending to steal the soldiers' horses did not attempt to do so, the horses being closely guarded. Thus ended the Battle of Prairie Dog Creek.  Aftermath  In the fight, the casualties were two Cheyenne's killed or wounded, two soldiers who suffered minor wounds, one of the soldiers' mule's killed, and two of the soldiers' horses wounded. The soldiers seemed to have rather enjoyed the skirmish, since it relieved the boredom in their otherwise mundane life in bivouac. Since the soldiers' mounts were well secured, the Cheyenne's suffered only a lost opportunity to steal some horses. Most of the same combatants that fought at Prairie Dog Creek on both sides, would soon move north and see action at the Battle of the Rosebud, only eight days later. And many of the Cheyenne warriors would also fight in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, just 16 days after Prairie Dog Creek.

This value is associated with a specific mortgage and fluctuates as currently available interest rates vary relative to the subject mortgage. Value is created and grows whenever the prevailing interest rate for a new mortgage loan is greater than and increasing when compared to the interest rate of the assumable mortgage. Similarly, the mortgage assumption value shrinks as market rates fall and hits zero if the market rate is less than or equal the rate on the assumable mortgage.  Calculation  Mortgage assumption value can be calculated as the net present value of the sum of the future monthly payment savings due to the assumable loan rate being lower than the prevailing new loan interest rate. The calculation may take different forms, below are two examples: #Calculate the monthly payment for a new hypothetical loan using the prevailing rate, current unpaid principal balance of the assumable loan, and remaining term in months on original assumable loan. Take the difference between this higher payment and the original assumable payment yielding the monthly savings amount. Last, discount using the prevailing rate the series of monthly savings to current value at prevailing rates. #Discount the remaining series of payments from the assumable loan using the prevailing rate as the discount rate. Then take the difference between this net present value and the actual unpaid principal balance. This also yields the mortgage assumption value and is computationally simpler than the first approach.  Example  An illustrative example using the 30-year fixed rate mortgage (historically the most common mortgage type in the United States) for comparison: A $100,000 assumable mortgage loan with a 4.00% rate has a corresponding monthly loan payment of $477.42. In this example let‚Äôs say the loan is assumed after 3 years (36 months) and that the unpaid principal balance will have reduced to $94,499. Now calculate the payment at a prevailing rate of 6.00%, principal of $94,499 and term of 27 years (original 30 years less 3 years until assumption) and the hypothetical payment is would be $589.66. Take the difference between this hypothetical payment and the actual assumable payment to calculate a monthly savings of $112.24. Now discount using a prevailing rate of 6.00% the 324-month (27 years) series of $112.24 hypothetical cash flows to yield a [net present value] of $17,988.

He was a grandson of Friedrich Schiller.  Life  He was the only child of Baron Adalbert von Gleichen-Ru√üwurm and his wife Emilie, Friedrich Schiller's youngest daughter.Hammelburg Online: Brief Biography King Ludwig I was his godfather. He first attended school in Meiningen, where his family spent the winter and his father had a seat in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen's advisory legislature. Later, he studied in Jena, Heidelberg and Geneva, followed by an internship with the Agricultural Academy at the University of Hohenheim. During a stay in Frankfurt, he met the Baroness Elisabeth von Thienen- Adlerflycht, daughter of the Danish charg√© d'affaires, and they were married in 1859. She died shortly after childbirth in 1865. Their son, , became a well-known writer and philosopher. His sense of loss led him to pursue his artistic inclinations. Leaving Alexander in the care of his mother Emilie, he moved into an apartment with a studio in Weimar, studying with Max Schmidt and Theodor Hagen at the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School. In 1872, he had his first exhibition in Berlin. During a stay in France in 1876, he came under the influence of the Barbizon school and developed an interest in etching. After 1880, he spent the winter in Berlin and travelled extensively during the summer. Together with Alexander, he participated in creating the Goethe- Schiller Archive, donating items from his family's collection. In 1889, he was named an honorary member of the Goethe-Gesellschaft and, five years later, was elected Chairman of the Deutsche Schillerstiftung.

It was released in February 2015 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. A sequel, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 was released in 2016.  Gameplay  The game is set almost entirely within a number of 3D battle arenas which are mostly modeled after notable locations in the Dragon Ball universe, accessed from the main hub ‚Äì the Toki-Toki City. Fighters can traverse the levels free-roaming in large spaces and can fight on ground, in the air and underwater. The game features spoken dialogue from a majority of main characters while in battle, and characters show facial expressions when they strike an opponent or take damage. Although limited, the players have some freedom to explore the planet Earth as it exists in the Dragon Ball universe along with a handful of other locations, including the aforementioned Toki-Toki City. Xenoverse is also the third Dragon Ball game to feature character creation, the first being Dragon Ball Online and the second being Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi. Player-created character has the option of becoming an apprentice of the original Dragon Ball characters in order to learn their special moves and access specific costume items. With character customization, players are able to customize their character's race, gender, facial hair, body features, clothing and character's voice effects. There are five available playable races: Saiyans, Namekians, Earthlings, Majins and Frieza's race; all of which have race specific advantages and bonuses as well as shortcomings. The online multiplayer is accessed from the Toki-Toki City, which serves as a hub where players can form groups and take on cooperative, time-traveling missions.  Plot  Unlike the previous games of the series that usually follow the original Dragon Ball story, Xenoverse features an entirely new story, featuring the player's custom character. The 2014 V-Jump #7 issue, in which the game was announced, draws attention to a mysterious figure watching the first battle between Goku and Vegeta from the shadows. With red hair, a scouter, and the Capsule Corporation logo on his sleeve, this character's identity was not clear. However, it was later revealed that this character is in fact a newly created character, confirming character creation feature. Another returning character is Time Patrol Trunks from Dragon Ball Online, who helps the player. Two new areas are also showcased: a completely new area named the Time Vault,V-Jump Issue #8, 2014 and the other being a high-tech city with what appears to be a Time Machine landed on it. The story is revealed to focus on two villains named Towa and Mira manipulating history and Time Patrol Trunks who is set to stop them. Trunks asks Shenron to send him a hero (the player being the hero) who would help him restore the timeline. The story borrows elements from the previous game, Dragon Ball Online, including Towa and Mira manipulating time, and Time Patrol Trunks trying to restore the timeline with the player's help.  Development  Dragon Ball Xenoverse, shortened as Dragon Ball XV, is the 15th Dragon Ball fighting game released on home consoles since Dimps' first Dragon Ball Z: Budokai game, and the first fighting game developed by Dimps to feature full 3D battles similar to the Budokai Tenkaichi and Raging Blast series developed by Spike.

Reception  =Critical response= Dragon Ball Xenoverse received fair reviews. On review aggregating website Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating in the 0‚Äì100 range, the PlayStation 4 version holds the score of 69/100 based on 50 reviews, while the Xbox One version holds 67/100 based on 18 reviews. Popular Japanese video game magazine Famitsu gave the game an overall score of 30/40 saying that it \\"isn‚Äôt without its faults and flaws\\" noting the repetitiveness of in-game missions and lag in team battles as its main drawbacks, concluding that the game is \\"aimed at Dragon Ball fans\\" and it might \\"appeal to fighting game fans and gamers that love fast action games\\". IGN gave the game a score of 6.7 out of 10, praising its \\"true-to-form graphics\\", unique story and customizable characters while criticizing its \\"shallow combat\\" and \\"unfair missions\\", noting that the game might appeal to \\"someone who enjoys anime, fighting, and role-playing games\\". Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 3.5 out of 5, praising the \\"create-a-character functionality\\", game mechanics and multiplayer mode, while criticizing the in- game camera movement and distancing from the established Dragon Ball continuity. GameTrailers gave it a slightly lower score of 6.0, noting the same flaws mentioned by both Famitsu and IGN, such as the \\"shallow combat\\" and repetitiveness as well as its potential appeal to mainly the franchise's established fan base rather than general audience while also noting that \\"those without such a strong attachment to the franchise may not be able to stomach the compromise.\\" GameSpot also gave the game a score of 6 out of 10, praising its detailed character customization system and a \\"new, interesting take on a tired story\\" while also criticizing its loose controls, repetitiveness and unbalanced gameplay. Destructoid gave it a score of 4.5 out of 10 or \\"below average\\", stating that it \\"has some high points, however they soon give way to glaring faults\\". While giving praise for the game's fighting mechanics and aesthetics as well as its similarity to source material, the general game design from balancing issues to repetitiveness is heavily criticized; saying that \\"Dragon Ball Xenoverse has some of the worst design decisions ever embedded into a video game\\", going on to conclude that \\"it certainly has its moments and the core fighting mechanics are great, however the game falls flat in too many other areas to be standout title.\\" The review also specifically noted the lingering online service related technical difficulties and poor performance on certain platforms. Toonami, during their aired video game review segments, gave the game a more favorable critique, giving it a score of 8 out of 10, stating that compared to the last few Dragon Ball games, Xenoverse \\"finally got it right\\" and that it's \\"a must\\" for Toriyama fans. = Sales = As of March 17, 2015, 1.5 million copies have been shipped worldwide.

It was formed in 1836 when Newcastle was one of Europe's biggest industrial cities. It was the first modern police force, formed three years before the County Police Act of 1839. The force had stations at Pilgrim Street in the City Centre, Arthur's Hill, Headlam Street, and Red Barnes, with section stations at Walker, Heaton, Kenton and Benwell village. The Pilgrim Street station was also a fire station. Each foot beat had a large police box where officers could rest and 'ring-in' to their main station and the public had access to a phone for advice or to summon help. At its peak Newcastle City had almost 1,000 police officers with MGB sports cars in its motor patrol fleet as well as its own specially tailored uniforms. On 1 April 1969 it was amalgamated into the Northumberland Constabulary under the Police Act 1964.\\"70 police forces to be axed in mergers\\". The Times. 19 May 1966. Newcastle upon Tyne City Police lost its identity after the 1969 mergers when the new Northumberland Constabulary was formed. Based at Pilgrim Street police station (now closed and relocated at Forth Banks), the old Newcastle City police HQ, like many multifunctional police forces, also housed the Magistrates Courts and fire station. It was designed by Cackett, Burns, Dick and MacKellar and opened in 1934. The classical elements of Corinthian columns and Egyptian solidity is clearly present, and it is also noted for its mock Babylonian sculptures. It only ended its use as police headquarters after the establishment of Northumbria Police after 1974 which moved to Ashington, then Ponteland sometime later. It also housed one of the two server storage systems for Northumbria Police that backs up and shares contingency information (disaster recovery) with its twin in Ponteland.

The forest Sami () were a Sami people who worked in the woods and who, unlike the reindeer-herding Sami people (the \\"fell Sami\\"), did not move up into the fells during the summer season. Historically, there have been forest Sami in Sweden in the area ranging from northern √Öngermanland to the far north. In the early 1600s the term granlapp was also used to refer to the Sami people who paid taxes only to Sweden, compared to the semi-nomadic fell Sami, who, since they worked in the fells that straddled the Swedish-Norwegian border, had to pay taxes to both countries. When Ernst Manker studied the life of the forest Sami in the early 20th century, nearly all of their habitations had been abandoned. Only one forest Sami village remained, in Mal√• in V√§sterbotten, an area known as Stenundslandet in Anundsj√∂. Background Historically, there were forest Sami in the northern parts of √Öngermanland and further north in Sweden. The two southernmost Sami regions, √Ösele and Lycksele, were not inhabited by fell Sami prior to 1606, but rather only by forest Sami, as was the Kemi lappmark in modern Finland. The forest Sami in Kemi, √Ösele, and Lycksele became assimilated into Finnish and Swedish society beginning in the 17th century. There are still forest Sami cultures present in the woods in Norrbotten and in Mal√• in V√§sterbotten.Tegengren, Helmer (1952). En utd√∂d lappkultur i Kemi lappmark: studier i Nordfinlands kolonisationshistoria Granlappar By the 1500s, there was already a difference between the forest Sami and the fell Sami. The forest Sami remained in the lowlands in summer, pasturing their reindeer in bogs, while the fell Sami moved their herds high onto the fells, above the tree line, for summer pasturage., citing At that time, the forest Sami were called granlappar (Spruce Lapps). As a result of this cultural divide, the two groups were subject to different forms of taxation. In 1585 Olof Andersson Burman, a government liaison to the Sami (lappfogde) in Lule√• and Pite√•, wrote: This meant that taxation was based on whether a person was a forest Sami or part of another Sami community.Uppb√∂rd, utarmning, utveckling: det samiska f√•ngstsamh√§llets √∂verg√•ng till rennomadism i Lule lappmark, Archive from Thesis 14, published 1982 by Lennart Lundmark pages 43‚Äì44 In the early 17th century, the term granlapp also referred to Sami people who were taxed only by Sweden, while the fell Sami could be taxed in both Sweden and Norway, as the fells in which they grazed their reindeer included land in both countries.Document about flyttlapparna, published by Renbeteskommissionen af 1907, Kristiania, JK Qvigstad Forest Sami villages Due to laws adopted in 1886 about the hunting of reindeer, some villages were established for easier administration of reindeer herding. For example, ten forest Sami villages near the town of Vittangi used the same name. These were located in G√§llivare, Jokkmove, St√•kke, Arjeplog, Malmesjaur, Eastern Kikkejaur, the western parts of Kikkejaur and Mausjaur, and Mal√•. In 1956, the Swedish Sami village in Jokkmokk was dismantled, as reindeer herding was halted in the area. Instead, two separate Sami villages were established in the southern and northern parts of Jokkmokk. Distribution and numbers In Pite√• in 1553, 47% of the Sami population were forest Sami. In 1555, in Lule√•, 73% were taxpaying forest Sami and 35% other Sami people. Similar differences in population size between the two groups continued throughout the 16th century.Skogslapparna i Sverige, Ernst Manker, 1968, Acta Lapponica XVIII Petrus L√¶stadius wrote in his journal in 1827 that the forest Sami had by that point become fewer than the Sami people. Nevertheless, he noted that in Arvidsjaur the population were still all forest Sami, with significant populations also in Arjeplog, Jokkmokk. and G√§llivare. In 1882, a committee was formed to investigate the situation of the Sami people in Sweden, and further data was made public:Marklund, Bertil (1999).

Ume√• *In Enonstekis, there were two forest Sami families from Pajala with 600 reindeer. *In Jukkasj√§rvi, there were three forest Sami families with about 500 reindeer. *In G√§llivare, there was a bigger population of forest Sami at 6,500. *In Jokkmokk, there were two forest Sami villages. *In Arjeplog, there were forest Sami families who had stopped herding reindeer and started fishing instead. Visten Wood goahti used by forest Sami at a viste in Koppsele, Mal√• Until the early 1900s forest Sami were spread over large geographic areas, with each household having its own territory. In each territory, there were settlements known as visten, each with a goahti, a Sami hut or tent. When Ernst Manker studied the forest Sami during the first decade of the 20th century, almost every viste had been abandoned for abodes that looked more like the homes of the Swedish majority culture: houses and farms.Skogssamiska studier: m√∂ten i kultur och n√§ringar 1650‚Äì1800. Kulturens frontlinjer, 16. Ume√• Fishing and hunting origin The forest Sami paid taxes that were different from those paid by the fell Sami in the 17th century based on their different modes of subsistence. Forest Sami during this period lived a less nomadic life, since they were less involved with herding reindeer. In the 1670s Samuel Rheen said that the forest Sami in Jokkmokk lived mostly on hunting and fishing. Nicolaus Lundius reported in the same period from Ume√• that the forest Sami had less money than other Sami people.Manker, Ernst (1957). Lapparnas heliga st√§llen. Acta Lapponica XIII. Stockholm A few forest Sami were reindeer owners in the 17th century. A protocol issued in 1699 stipulated that Ture Turesson was the owner of 100 reindeer in Rusksele.Rusksele: Lycksele sockens √§ldsta by, 1964, Ossian Egerbladh. Religion Very little is known about the religious beliefs of the forest Sami in pre-Christian times. It is known is that they believed in nature spirits, and that meaningful places, such as mountains and lakes, had their own spirit world. The male head of each family used a ceremonial drum to contact that spirit world. There were also noaidis, who were men considered more capable of establishing contact with the spirits. Bears were known to be part of a special cult, and the forest Sami people had intricate ceremonies revolving around them. Languages Most forest Sami people used Swedish as their main language, but the Sami language was also used to a certain degree. In Lule√•, both the forest Sami and other Sami people also spoke the Lule Sami language. In Pite√• the fell Sami spoke the Pite Sami language, while the local forest Sami spoke mostly Swedish or the Ume Sami language. The forest Sami in Mal√• and eastern Sorsele also spoke Ume Sami.Bergsland, Knut (1967). \\"Lapp dialectal groups and problems of history\\". Lapps and Norsemen in olden times. Bergen: Instituttet for sammenlignende kulturforskning XXVI. pages 32‚Äì53 In Lycksele and √Ösele the forest Sami were almost entirely assimilated into Swedish society during the 19th century. Their old language was permanently lost. Sami literature from the 17th and 18th centuries, by Olaus Stephani Graan and Pehr Fj√§llstr√∂m, respectively, demonstrate that at that time there were still many speakers of Ume Sami. The spread of the Ume Sami language is discussed by J.A. Nensen in the 19th century, when the forest Sami in √Ös√∂ee used a dialect considered a variety of Ume Sami. Nensen stated that their language was clearly separate from the southern dialect of the Sami languages, which was used by the other Sami population in Vilhelmina. End of forest Sami culture With the decline of reindeer herding in large parts of Norrland, the forest Sami culture disappeared, since they no longer continued their traditional lifestyle. In Kemi, Finland, the Finnish forest Sami for the most part lost their distinct identity and were assimilated into the other Sami groups, adopting their languages. Similar changes occurred in √Ösele and Lycksele during the 18th century. 1758 map of Stensundslandet Stensundslandet Only one forest Sami village, Stenundslandet in Mal√•, survived into the 19th century. Nils Persson (1804‚Äì1880) was the last known forest Sami to continue in the traditional lifestyle. In 1842 Persson received authorization from the municipal leaders to conduct reindeer work, which he continued until his death. The reindeer business was subsequently taken over by his daughter Sara Johanna and her husband Lars Jonsson, but they eventually abandoned the traditional lifestyle.Westerdahl, Christer (2008).

Completed in 1974 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the dam is located at the confluence of the West Fork Mojave River and Deep Creek, and can store approximately of water. History The Mojave River forks were first identified as a potential dam site in 1875, and flooding in the 1930s confirmed the need for a flood control facility along the Mojave River. However, it would be 30 more years before the state endorsed such a project. The West Fork Flood Control and Reservoir Project were authorized in 1960, and the USACE created a final design by 1966. Construction began in June 1967, and the embankment was topped out in May 1971. The project was formally completed and operational by 1974. Federal engineers found in 2019 that the dam falls short of national safety standards and could erode and collapse in an extreme flood. Mojave River dam outlet (upstream view) Dimensions and location The dam is high from the foundations, high above the riverbed, and long. The main embankment, a rolled earthfill design, contains of material. A smaller auxiliary dam is located directly to the west of the main dam, while the concrete spillway is on the east side of the dam. The reservoir controls runoff from a rugged drainage basin of on the north slope of the San Bernardino Mountains. Although the entire Mojave River basin covers , the comparatively small area behind the dam contributes the vast majority of the water in the river, the remaining 95 percent of the watershed being desert. The towns of Victorville, Hesperia and others in the Victor Valley region along the Mojave River, as well as towns further downstream such as Barstow, are the primary beneficiaries of the project. Operations Because the dam serves strictly for flood control, the reservoir is usually low or non-existent; however, it can fill quickly following heavy winter storms. Flood waters are released as quickly as possible without exceeding the capacity of downstream levees. Unlike most dams, the Mojave Dam outlet has no gates, meaning that the outflow is directly dependent on the water level behind the dam. All river flows below pass unimpeded through the dam's outlets. The dam is designed to contain a design flood of , to a maximum outflow of . The reservoir is generally drained within 2‚Äì3 days of a flooding event. Because the dam reduces the sharp peaks of flash floods in the Mojave River channel, it also provides incidental groundwater recharge benefits in the Victor Valley area. Recreation Although there is no permanent pool at Mojave Forks, the dam and the surrounding area are part of Mojave River Forks Regional Park, which provides camping and hiking facilities. The Pacific Crest Trail also runs parallel the eastern end of the dam as it travels between the valleys of Deep Creek and the West Fork Mojave River.

The company was started in the bedroom of owner Eric Mueller and has grown into a full-scale operation that now includes offices in Emeryville, California, New Jersey, and Czech Republic. It is the manufacturing and production wing to its sister company, Pirates Press Records.  Company history  Pirates Press was founded in 2004 by Eric ‚ÄúSkippy‚Äù Mueller in San Francisco, California. Mueller started Pirates Press with the intent to ‚Äòprotect independent labels, bands, artists and businesses from being swindled and handicapped by big corporate manufacturers who really don‚Äôt care about them.‚Äô‚Äù The company has seen 75-100% yearly growth since its inception. In 2005, Pirates Press produced about 250,000 vinyl. In 2008, the company produced around 1.75 million vinyl for its customers. In 2009, Pirates Press produced over 2 million records for its customers. Clients include Tom Petty, White Stripes, Beck, Slayer, Eric Clapton, Madonna, and more. The company is one of only a few remaining vinyl pressers in the United States. Pirates Press has also brought back the manufacturing of flexi disc which are done on-site at the company‚Äôs warehouse. Pirates Press uses the world's oldest vinyl manufacturing plant where each record is pressed on a manual machine whereas the US plants use suction-cup machines. This traditional pressing style allows employees to \\"...concoct original color compounds and press records by hand. This means customers have access to just about anything they can dream up, from orange marble to translucent red; solid white to half- purple and half-green; even glitter and glow-in-the-dark.\\" Pirates Press' engineers have created a technology that can digitally recreate a record before it is cut to analyze what the grooves would look like with different input settings or a different version of the master.

A major element of SC27's program of work includes International Standards for information security management systems (ISMS), often referred to as the 'ISO/IEC 27000-series'. The full title of ISO/IEC 27040 is Information technology ‚Äî Security techniques ‚Äî  Overview and introduction  The purpose of ISO/IEC 27040 is to provide security guidance for storage systems and ecosystems as well as for protection of data in these systems. It supports the general concepts specified in ISO/IEC 27001. This International Standard is relevant to managers and staff concerned with information security risk management within an organization and, where appropriate, external parties supporting such activities. The objectives for this International Standard are to: * publicizing the risks, * assist organizations in better securing their data, * provide a basis for designing and auditing storage security controls. ISO/IEC 27040 provides specific, detailed implementation guidance relevant to storage security for the general security controls described in ISO/IEC 27002. This International Standard is not a reference or normative document for regulatory and legislative security requirements as they vary by country.  History  Work commenced on ISO/IEC 27040 in the fall of 2010, following the SC27 meeting in Redmond, WA. The project was placed on the extended timeline, allowing up to 48 months to develop the standard rather than the normal 36 months. The ISO/IEC 27040 standard was published on January 5, 2015. Throughout the development of ISO/IEC 27040, organizations such as the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) with its Storage Security Best Current Practices (BCPs), the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG) Storage Working Group with its work on self-encrypting drives, and INCITS' storage-oriented Technical Committees (T10, T11, and T13) provided important comments and contributions. Eric Hibbard served as the ISO Editor throughout the development of ISO/IEC 27040.  Structure of the standard  27040:2015 has seven short clauses and three annexes, which cover: :1. Scope of the standard :2. A list of other standards that are indispensable to understanding and using ISO/IEC 27040 :3. Terminology that is either imported from other standards or defined in this standard :4. A list of used abbreviations and acronyms used in the standard :5. An overview of key storage and storage security concepts as well as information on the associated risks :6. Describes the controls that support storage security technical architectures, including Direct Attached Storage (DAS), storage networking, storage management, block-based storage, file-based storage, object-based storage, and security services. :7. Provides guidelines for the design and implementation of storage security (e.g., design principles; data reliability, availability, and resilience; data retention; data confidentiality and integrity; visualization; and design and implementation considerations) :Annex A. Media-specific guidance for sanitization, including cryptographic erase (parallels NIST SP 800-88r1) :Annex B. Tables for selecting appropriate security controls based on data sensitivity or security priorities (confidentiality, integrity, or availability) :Annex C. Descriptions of important security and storage concepts (mini-tutorials) :Bibliography. A list of standards and specifications that had an influence on materials in ISO/IEC 27040 It is worth noting that the bibliography is one of the more comprehensive lists of references on storage security.  Supporting controls for storage security  A major element of the ISO/IEC 27040 standard is focused on the identification of security controls for different types of storage systems and architectures, including the following: * Recommendations to help secure Direct Attached Storage (DAS) * Broad coverage of security for storage networking technologies and topologies with an emphasis on Storage Area Networks or SAN (e.g., Fibre Channel, iSCSI, FCoE, etc.) and Network Attached Storage or NAS (e.g., NFS and SMB/CIFS) * Identifying important security issues and guidance for storage management * Security for block-based storage systems with Fibre Channel and IP interfaces (above and beyond the storage networking materials) * Security for file-based storage systems with NFS, SMB/CIFS, and pNFS interfaces (above and beyond the storage networking materials) * Security for cloud storage, object-based storage (OSD) and Content Addressable Storage (CAS) * Recommendations for storage security services (sanitization, data confidentiality, and data reductions)  Design and implementation guidance for storage security  Despite the increased power of personal computers and departmental workstations, there continues to be a dependency on centralized data centers due to needs for data integration, data consistency, and data quality. With the enormous growth of critical data volumes, many organizations have adopted storage-centric architectures for their ICT infrastructure. Consequently, storage security plays an important role in securing this data, and in many instances, it serves as the last line of defense from both internal and external adversaries. The design of storage security solutions is guided by core security principles while considering data sensitivity, criticality and value. Section 6 of the standard (Supporting Controls) provides guidance on applying storage-relevant controls in implementing the designed solution. The materials in this section are further divided into: * Storage security design principles (Defense in depth, Security domains, Design resilience, and Secure initialization) * Data reliability, availability, and resilience (including Backups and replication as well as Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity) * Data retention (Long-term and Short to medium-term retention) * Data confidentiality and integrity * Virtualization (Storage virtualization and Storage for virtualized systems) * Design and implementation considerations (Encryption and key management issues, Align storage and policy, Compliance, Secure multi-tenancy, Secure autonomous data movement)  Media sanitization  \\"Sanitization\\" is the technical term for assuring that data left on storage at the end of its useful life is rendered inaccessible to a given level of effort. Or to put it another way, sanitization is the process that assures an organization doesn't commit a data breach by repurposing, selling, or discarding storage devices. Sanitization can take many forms depending on both the sensitivity of the information and the level of effort a likely adversary would invest in attempting to recover the information. Methods used in sanitization range from simple overwrites to destruction of the cryptographic keys for encrypted data (the technique is known as cryptographic erasure) to physical destruction of the storage media. This standard provides guidance to help organizations select the proper sanitization methods for their data. The specific details on sanitization are provided in a series of tables in Annex A, which were based on NIST Special Publication 800-88 Revision 1. The tables were designed so that vendors can make specific references to them, based on the type of media, instead of using obsolete sources such as DoD 5220.22-M (from 1995).  Selecting appropriate storage security controls  The developers of ISO/IEC 27040 did not intend that all of the guidance had to be implemented (i.e., all or nothing). Consequently, Annex B was created to help organizations select the appropriate controls based on either data sensitivity (high or low) or security priorities, based on confidentiality, integrity and availability. To support this selection, all of the storage security controls in ISO/IEC 27040 are listed in 13 different tables along with information that shows how each control is relevant from both data sensitivity and security prioritization perspectives. It is worth noting that although Annex B is informative, it is very likely that auditors will use it as a basis for checklists when reviewing the security of storage systems and ecosystems.  Important security concepts  One of the challenges in developing ISO/IEC 27040 was that there were two distinct target audiences: 1) storage professionals and 2) security professionals. To help both communities, Annex C was populated with useful tutorial information for the following: * Authentication * Authorization and access control * Self-encrypting drives (SED) * Sanitization * Logging * N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) * Fibre Channel Security * OASIS Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)  References  #27040 #27040 Category:Information assurance standards ","title":"ISO/IEC 27040"},{"id":"43047030","text":"Ahvaz Metro is a metro system serving the city of Ahvaz, Iran.

His topics include phenomena such as surf culture, prisons, cinema, and gay culture. Friedkin‚Äôs photographs have been exhibited in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the J. Paul Getty Museum. His photographs are included in major Museum collections: New York's Museum of Modern Art, The J. Paul Getty Museum and others. He is represented in numerous private collections as well. His pictures have been published in Japan, Russia, Europe, and many Fine Art magazines in America. In 2014, The Gay Essay, which documents Californian gay culture during the late 1960s and early 1970s, was featured in San Francisco's deYoung Museum. He has over forty years experience as a professional photographer. Anthony Friedkin has lived and worked out of his apartment studio in Santa Monica.  Early life and photojournalism  Friedkin was born in Los Angeles, California in 1949. At age 8, he started taking photographs, and by the age of 11, he was developing photos in a darkroom. In 1968-99, he attended Santa Monica City College as a liberal arts major. During 1969-1970, he moved on to the Art Center College of Design with a concentration in photography. During 1971-1972, he attended the University of California, Los Angeles as a photography major. In 1971, he attended the Royal College of Art as a visiting student. In 1972, he attended an Aperion Workshop in Millerton, New York. In 1975, he started working as a still photographer for the film industry. For a time, he worked as a photojournalist working as a stringer for Magnum Photos in Los Angeles. During his career he taught photography at both UCLA and California Institute of the Arts.  Accomplishments  He received a National Endowment of the Arts grant in 1977 and was given a special commendation by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley for his contribution to Fine Art Photography in 1980.  Bodies of work  > Together his completed photo essays are: \\"The Gay Essay,\\" done in San > Francisco and Los Angeles in 1969 and 1970; \\"The Beverly Hills Essay,\\" shot > in 1975; \\"The Hollywood Series,\\" which was inaugurated by a special > commission in 1978 and continues to this day; and \\"The Ocean-Surfing Essay,\\" > which explores Friedkin‚Äôs intimate, intensely personal relationship with the > sea and its magnificent waves. A historical set of photographs on \\"New York > City Brothels,\\" includes genuine studies of prostitutes in their work > environment. A special set of pictures on \\"California Prisons\\"and their > inmates, includes sensitive portraits of incarcerated teenagers. For most of > his life he has been photographing \\"Los Angeles,\\" creating an unparalleled > body of images, which comes from his love of the diversely visual and > cultural town. Of all his major photographic series, only one documents life outside the Golden State (New York City Brothels). = The Hollywood Essay = In 1978, Friedkin began work on a series of photographs showing the behind-the-scenes realities of the cinema industry. These photographs challenge viewers to step back from the illusion of real life that Hollywood movies create, instead showing the artifice and business behind the illusion. In a 2014 interview, Friedkin indicated this work is still in progress. In 1985, a subset of costume photography from the essay was displayed at the Nicola gallery in Los Angeles. In 1986, The Hollywood Essay was featured at the Min Gallery in Tokyo, Japan. = California Prisons: Incarceration: Images from Folsom Prison = In 2004, the work was displayed at the fine art gallery of Los Angeles Harbor College. California Prisons includes sensitive portrait shots of incarcerated teenagers, as well as the many typical representations of machismo and gang affiliated men. = Ocean View: The Depiction of Southern California Coastal Lifestyles = In a series of photographs titled Ocean View: The Depiction of Southern California Coastal Lifestyles, Friedkin examined the mythology of California that has enticed people, industries, and money to the state over the past century. Many of the photographs document surf culture, showing it in the wider context of the imagery of the California Dream. He made the twenty black-and-white photographs of his Wave Portfolio between 1977 and 2006, printing them in his own darkroom in Santa Monica. They show waves at Zuma Beach, Venice Beach, Hermosa Beach, La Jolla, Carmel, and Santa Monica. Friedkin is a lifelong surfer and self-styled ‚Äúdisciple of the sea.‚Äù In the Wave Portfolio he brings to his images a sense of both the power of the waves and their beauty as abstract forms. ‚ÄúWaves are like liquid sculpture,‚Äù he has written. ‚ÄúThey move with dynamic force and ethereal beauty . . . I do believe the ocean, with its jewel like waves, is where we came from; and when I‚Äôm in the water, I feel like I‚Äôm connecting to something so mighty and so primordial it‚Äôs amazing. All the mysteries of life and death, light and darkness, space and time, are to be found there. By photographing the ocean waves I hope to reveal their secrets within.‚Äù = The Gay Essay = In 1969, when Friedkin was 19, he began to chronicle gay life in Los Angeles and San Francisco, hoping to increase its visibility and gain a better understanding of gay culture there. The photo essay was captured in the years of sexual revolution, around the time of the Stonewall riots. While taking the portraits in informal settings such as hotels and bars, he often developed close relationships with his subjects. In 2014, Friedkin released The Gay Essay, a book containing 75 portraits from the series, published by Yale University Press. The publisher announced that the book is intended to be the first of several books containing photos from the series. Friedkin began his work on the ‚ÄúGay Essay,‚Äù when he was only nineteen years of age, and set out ‚Äúto depict [the] struggles, humiliations, and [the] triumphs [of queer culture]\\". Friedkin‚Äôs goal was to document what it meant to defy the grain when it is wrong, that is to show the courage it takes to define one‚Äôs own freedom and individuality. ‚ÄúThe Gay Essay‚Äù was not shown in America for a long time due to the sensitivity of the images Friedkin produced and a less than receptive society whose mainstream was overwhelmingly homophobic, simply put, but was exhibited in Europe and East Asia and was received well. From June 2014 to January 2015, San Francisco's DeYoung Museum exhibited the 75 prints to coincide with the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. The exhibit also included materials from the artist's archive that convey the historical context of the work.

Background  At the beginning of the twentieth century, the first military armoured vehicles were manufactured by adding armour and weapons to existing vehicles. The first armoured car was the Simms' Motor War Car, designed by F.R. Simms in response to the Second Boer War and built by Vickers, Sons & Maxim in Britain Another early armoured car of the period was the French Charron, Girardot et Voigt 1902, presented at the Salon de l'Automobile et du cycle in Brussels, on 8 March 1902. The vehicle was equipped with a Hotchkiss machine gun, and with 7 mm armour for the gunner although it, too, was only a prototype and never used in warfare.  History  The Minerva's use in combat in August 1914 made Belgium one of the first nations to employ armoured cars in World War I, though Italy had previously been the first to use armoured cars in a theatre of conflict, in the 1911‚Äì1912 Italo-Turkish War. Also the armoured Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade was formed on August 24, 1914 and close to being assembled by that September. During the war those that could afford to rode into battle on their own horses, much like this (in 1914) Lieutenant Charles Henkart arranged for two of his civilian Minerva Motor Works tourers to be armoured at the Cockerill Works in Hoboken. The initial armoured cars were ad hoc but soon Minerva had created a standard design. American papers were reporting the use of the armoured car by September 1914. The crew was partially exposed to gunfire with the open top. This would prove fatal to Lieutenant Henkart when on September 6, 1914 he was killed by gunfire after the armoured car he was in was caught in a German ambush. Before the Minerva factory was captured during the German invasion and occupation of Belgium about thirty Minerva armored cars were built. In 1916 the design of the original armoured car was completely revised. The open top was now fully enclosed and the machine gun under an armoured cupola. The Belgian Army used the cars as motorised cavalry units with three- car platoons. The armoured car units were mostly used for reconnaissance, infantry fire support and missions behind enemy lines. After the Western Front became bogged down in trench warfare some of the cars were sent to the Eastern Front with the Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia. The Germans were able capture three of the cars and modified them for use during the invasion of Romania with at least one being used during the 1919 troubles. They even saw use in the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s.

Its territory had formerly been part of Andhra Pradesh. The Telangana movement was instrumental in the creation of the new state, and Telangana Rashtra Samithi, a party which led the Telangana movement after 2001, forms the government in the Telangana Legislative Assembly under Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao.  Telangana movement  In the early Telangana movement, Marri Chenna Reddy formed a party called Telangana Praja Samiti to lead the Telangana movement. In November 1969, there was a major split in the party and as a result the movement declined. After two years the Telangana Praja Samiti was dissolved and its members rejoined the Congress. A successor party, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was formed in 2001 by Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao. On 29 November 2009, Chandrashekar Rao started a fast-unto-death, demanding that the Congress party introduce a Telangana bill in Parliament. Student organisations, employee unions, and various organisations joined the movement. As general strikes shut down much economic activity in Telangana, Telangana Bill was passed in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 and in Rajya Sabha on 18 February 2014 with the support of the BJP. On 4 March 2014 the Government of India declared that 2 June would be the Telangana Formation Day.  Elections  The 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election was held in united Andhra Pradesh state shortly before the formation of Telangana, on 30 April 2014. The results were declared on 16 May 2014, with Telangana Rashtra Samithi having won an overall majority within Telangana. This party went on to lead the first Government of Telangana when the Telangana Legislative Assembly was established, and won an increased majority in the 2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly election. Chandrashekar Rao has been Chief Minister throughout.

During the episode the hosts strongly criticized the company, referring to it as \\"the Phish of news\\" and \\"MSNBC live\\". In addition, the hosts criticized the company's reading of the Percy Shelley poem \\"Ozymandias\\" as incorrect. OZY Fest 2018 was also criticized as a \\"neoliberal nightmare\\" by Rolling Stone, a \\"sizzling hot festival for folks who love Coachella and neoliberalism\\" by GQ, and \\"a progressive alternate reality\\" by The Washington Post.

In order to function effectively, the technology core (hardware, software and brainware) needs to be embedded in its support structure (TSN). Changes in the core then trigger requisite changes in TSN. Any core and its TSN co-evolve in a symbiotic way of mutual strengthening. At certain stage, TSN starts dictating acceptable changes in the core and ultimately becomes an effective barrier to further innovation. At such point, a time for new, disruptive technology emerges. The entire structure of the technology core and its support network of requisite flows are sketched in Figure 1. It is clear that the architecture of the Technology Support Net functions as the main determinant of technology use, change and the rate of innovation. Milan Zeleny in his book Human Systems Management, has laid down the foundation of modern technology management, innovation and change. Technology support network (TSN) is the necessary condition for continued technology core innovation. Without matching the support network, any new technology has little chance of succeeding. The infrastructure of technology support net, when fully established, could present significant barriers to significant innovation. The process of innovation is no longer open and autonomous, but often technically and politically subservient to the ‚Äúholders and owners‚Äù of the support net. Technology, through its requisite support net, limits and predetermines the flows and types of innovation. Nowadays the processes of invention and innovation are not limited only by lack of knowledge or too narrow business criteria, but by the defenders of the existing support network (including infrastructure). The focus is not so much on hardware (which is becoming commoditized), nor software or brainware, but on the boundaries and architecture of the support net itself.  Components of technology  Any technology can be divided into four key components: = Hardware = The physical structure or logical layout, plant or equipment of machine or contrivance. This is the means to carry out required tasks of transformation to achieve purpose or goals. Hardware therefore refers not only to particular physical structure of components, but also to their logical layout. = Software = The set of rules, guidelines, and algorithms necessary for using the hardware (program, covenants, standards, rules of usage) to carry out the tasks. This is the know-how, which means how to carry out tasks to achieve purpose or goals. = Brainware = The purpose (objectives and goals), reason and justification for using or deploying the hardware/software in a particular way. This is the know-what and the know-why of technology. That is, the determination of what to use or deploy, when, where and why. These three components form the technology core. The components of the technology core are co-determinant, their relations circular and mutually enhancing. The interdependence among the three components is well illustrated in the example of automobile as technology: A car consists of its own physical structure and logical layout, its own hardware. Its software consists of operating rules of the push, turn, press, etc., described in manuals or acquired through learning. The brainware is supplied by the driver and includes decisions where to go, when, how fast, which way and why to use a car at all. Computers, satellites or the Internet can be defined in terms of these above three dimensions. Any information technology or system should also be clearly identifiable through its hardware, software and brainware. = Technology Support Net = TSN is a network of flows: materials, information, energies, skills, laws, rules of conduct that circulate to, through and from the network in order to enable the proper functioning of the technology core and the achieving of given purpose or goals. Ultimately, all the requisite network flows are initiated, maintained and consumed by people participating in the use and support of the use of a given technology. They might similarly and simultaneously participate in supporting many different technologies through many different TSNs. Sameer Kumar wrote that TSNs can be intermeshed into larger hyper networks, thereby revealing important complementary, competing and collaborating technologies. The relationship between the technology core and its requisite TSN is that of mutual enhancement and codetermination. Every unique technology core gives rise to a specific and requisite TSN and thus to a specific set of relationships among people. Ultimately, the TSN can be traced to and translated into the relationships among human participants: initiators, providers and maintainers of the requisite flows in cooperative social settings. In this sense, every technology is a form of a social relationship brought forth from the background environment. The following example describes the various social relationships among people caused by technology support net. As for the automobile technology, its TSN consists of an infrastructure of roads, bridges, facilities and traffic signals, but also of maintenance and emergency services, rules and laws of conduct, institutions of their enforcement, style and culture of driving behavior, etc. A large number of people have to be organized in a specific and requisite pattern in order to enable cars to function as technology. Moreover, technology and its four components could also be defined from the vantage point of its own user or observer, not in a context-free or absolute sense. In other words, roads, bridges and traffic signals can be technologies themselves, with their own hardware, software, brainware and support nets. For example, traffic lights are a part of the TSN of an automobile, but their own hardware can be driven by their own software (a computer-controlled switching program or schedule) and brainware (purposes of safety, volume and flow control, and interaction with pedestrians). This technology core has its own support net of electricity, signal interpretations and car traffic. So the traffic light is a technology of its own. Similarly, a piece of software from some technology can itself become viewed as technology, in order to achieve specific business purposes or goals with its own hardware, software, brainware and TSN.  Functions of technology  At its most fundamental, technology is a tool used in transforming inputs into output (products) or, more generally, towards achieving purposes or goals. For example, the inputs can be material, information, skills or services. The product can be goods, services or information. Such a tool can be both physical (machine, computer) and logical (methodology, technique). Technology as a tool does not have to be from steel, wood or silica, it could also be a recipe, process or algorithm. The nature of technology has changed in the global era during the development of human history: it is becoming more integrative and more knowledge-oriented, it is available globally and it includes also logical schemes, procedures and software, not just tools and machinery. It tends to complement or extend the user, not to make him a simple appendage. In order to utilize technology efficiently and effectively, it should be viewed as a form of social relationship, with hardware and software being enabled by brainware and the requisite support network. This is the view from Joseph Stiglitz, the recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2001) on technology transfer: Stiglitz's emphasis is on the insufficiency of information (or codified ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù) and the hardware- software mindset. Information can always be ‚Äúdownloaded‚Äù, knowledge cannot. Knowledge has to be produced within the local circumstances and structural support. In recent times, technology refers to a package of hardware, software, brainware ‚Äì and primarily, the requisite support net which fixates, limits and predetermines the flows and types of innovation. In many modern technologies, the hardware is becoming a commodity, the least decisive component, a mere physical casing for the real power of effective knowledge contents. The enabling technology support network is often becoming the most important component of technology: Charu Chandra described that technology organizations aim at achieving total system productivity, not task. In order to achieve this, workflow within and between departments must be integrated. This is achieved by organizing a project with interconnected tasks of activities that use inputs to produce output(s) according to common objectives and goals. One of the ways to do this is managing its effects on the support net of requisite relationships. In the near future it will not be the number of computers per capita, but the density and capacity of their network interconnectedness which will determine their effective usage.

Established in 1616 in hopes to educate new generations of anti-Protestants, the college was one of the major cultural and educational centers in Samogitia. In 1620‚Äì1742, it shared premises with the Samogitian Priest Seminary. In 1844, the college was transferred to Kaunas. History =Establishment= Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis raised the idea of establishing a college in Kra≈æiai, the first higher education institution in Samogitia. To that end, in 1608, he invited the Jesuits, bought them land and built a house for their needs. Merkelis died the following year; in his last will, he left money and land for the construction of a Jesuit monastery. Other patrons included Miko≈Çaj Krzysztof \\"the Orphan\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç who donated a palace, built in 1565, and Jan Karol Chodkiewicz who donated seven homesteads. The college was founded in 1613, and was called Collegium Chodkievicianum in honor of Chodkiewicz. The first class was held only in September 1616 in a temporary wooden house. The construction of a permanent school began in 1618 (the ceremony of laying the cornerstone was attended by Grand Treasurer Hieronim Wo≈Ç≈Çowicz). At the time, the college already had about 50 students and 12 teachers. =Growth and reorganizations= Gradually, with the support of many wealthy sponsors, the college expanded into a large campus, including its own church built in 1625‚Äì89. Full financial support was given to 26 impoverished students. On average, the school employed 30‚Äì50 Jesuits and educated 250‚Äì300 students. The curriculum and teaching methods followed the Ratio Studiorum. Students belonged to the Sodality of Our Lady and visited the sick. The college had its own student theater (30 performances are known) and a rich library, which in 1803 held 3,264 volumes (oldest dating back to 1427). The college suffered severe human and capital losses during the Swedish invasion of 1656 and the plague of 1710, but recovered. After the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, the college's administration was taken over by the Commission of National Education. After the Third Partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Carmelites from Kolainiai administered the school from 1797 to 1817. In 1817, Tsarist authorities secularized the school, changed its name to gymnasium, introduced primary education classes, and transferred its administration to Vilnius University. As such, the number of students grew and exceeded 400. =Move to Kaunas= Vilnius University was closed in the aftermath of the 1831 November Uprising. After the establishment of the Kovno Governorate in 1843, the gymnasium was transferred from Kra≈æiai to Kaunas (the present-day Maironis Gymnasium). The campus in Kra≈æiai was abandoned and fell into ruins. Only the former student dormitory (bursa) survives to this day. The building was extensively renovated in 2008 and houses the Cultural Center of M. K. Sarbievijus, Kra≈æiai Region Museum, and the library and art collection of Charlotte Narkiewicz-Laine. Teachers and students The first teacher, Jonas Kochas, was sent from the Collegium Hosianum in Royal Prussia. Among the first teachers was poet Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski who taught syntax. Other notable teachers included historian Albert Wijuk Koja≈Çowicz who taught rhetoric, ≈Ωygimantas Liauksminas (Sigismundus Lauxmin) who was also college's rector, and future Bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius. Notable students included writers Dionizas Po≈°ka and Simonas Staneviƒçius, folklorists Liudvikas Adomas Juceviƒçius, explorers Jan Prosper Witkiewicz, brothers Antanas and Jonas Ju≈°ka.

(Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1819) Fornication is generally consensual sexual intercourse between two people not married to each other. When one or more of the partners having consensual sexual intercourse is a married person, it is called adultery. For many people, the term carries an overtone of moral or religious disapproval, but the significance of sexual acts to which the term is applied varies between religions, societies and cultures. In modern usage, the term is often replaced with a more judgment-neutral terms like premarital sex or extramarital sex.  Etymology and usage  In the original Greek version of the New Testament, the term porneia (œÄŒøœÅŒΩŒµŒØŒ± ‚Äì \\"prostitution\\") is used 25 times (including variants such as the genitive œÄŒøœÅŒΩŒµŒØŒ±œÇ). In the late 4th century, the Latin Vulgate, a Latin translation of the Greek texts, translated the term as fornicati, fornicatus, fornicata, and fornicatae. The terms fornication and fornicators are found in the 1599 Geneva Bible, the 1611 King James Version, the 1899 Catholic Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible, and the 1901 American Standard Version. See Matthew 5:32 for usage of the word in English Bibles.see 1 Corinthians 6.9 fornicators in GNV, KJV, DRA, ASV translations Many modern post World War 2 Bible translations completely avoid all usage of fornicators and fornication: English Standard Version, New Living Translation, New International Version, Christian Standard Bible, Good News Bible and Contemporary English Version do not use the terms fornication or fornicators.SQL database search for terms fornication or fornicators in respective Bible Translations. Where one translation may use fornication another translation may use whoredom, sexual immorality (e.g., ) or more simply immoral or immorality.see 1 Corinthians 6.9 RSV (immoral) vs KJV (fornicators) In Latin, the term fornix means arch or vault. In Ancient Rome, prostitutes waited for their customers out of the rain under vaulted ceilings, and fornix became a euphemism for brothels, and the Latin verb fornicare referred to a man visiting a brothel. The first recorded use in English is in the Cursor Mundi, c. 1300; the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records a figurative use as well: \\"The forsaking of God for idols\\". Fornicated as an adjective is still used in botany, meaning \\"arched\\" or \\"bending over\\" (as in a leaf). John Milton plays on the double meaning of the word in The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty (1642): \\"[She] gives up her body to a mercenary whordome under those fornicated [ar]ches which she cals Gods house.\\"  Christian views  = Generalities = The Pauline epistles contain multiple condemnations of various forms of extramarital sex. The First Epistle to the Corinthians states \\"Flee from sexual immorality\\" and lists adulterers and \\"those who are sexually immoral\\"/practicing-fornicators in a list of \\"wrongdoers who... will not inherit the kingdom of God\\". First Corinthians and the Epistle to the Galatians also address fornication. The Apostolic Decree of the Council of Jerusalem also includes a prohibition of fornication. Throughout history, most theologians have argued that any and all forms of premarital sex are immoral. A historical example is the medieval English monastic, John Baconthorpe. A more contemporary example is the modern-day theologian Lee Gatiss who argues that premarital sex is immoral based on scripture. He states that, from a Biblical perspective, \\"physical union should not take place outside a \\"one flesh\\" (i.e. marriage) union... In [1 Corinthians] chapter 7 Paul addresses the situation of two unmarried Christians who are burning with passion (7:8‚Äì9) who should either exercise self-control or be permitted to marry (cf. verses 36‚Äì38). The underlying assumptions are the same as those in Deuteronomy 22.\\" However, a minority of theologians have argued in more recent times that premarital sex may not be immoral in some limited circumstances. An example is John Witte, who argues that the Bible itself is silent on the issue of consensual, premarital sex between an engaged couple. In other words, Witte claims that the Bible excludes premarital sex from its list of unlawful sexual relations (Leviticus 18) though Leviticus 18 is not the only such list, nor does Leviticus 18 claim to be exhaustive being devoted largely to forms of incest. Some of the debate arises from the question of which theological approach is being applied. A deontological view of sex interprets porneia, aselgeia and akatharsia in terms of whether the couple are married or non-married. What makes sex moral or immoral is the context of marriage. By contrast, a teleological view interprets porneia, aselgeia and akatharsia in terms of the quality of the relationship (how well it reflects God's glory and Christian notions of a committed, virtuous relationship). The debate also turns on the definition of the two Greek words moicheia (ŒºŒøŒπœáŒµŒØŒ±, adultery) and porneia (:el:œÄŒøœÅŒΩŒµŒØŒ±, meaning prostitution, from which the word pornography derives). The first word is restricted to contexts involving sexual betrayal of a spouse; however, the second word is used as a generic term for illegitimate sexual activity, although many scholars hold that the Septuagint uses \\"porneia\\" to refer specifically to male temple prostitution. Elsewhere in First Corinthians, incest, homosexual intercourse (according to some interpretations)arsenokoitƒìs (masc. noun of fem. 1st declension), literally a man who shares a bed with other men (see LSJ and BDAG). and prostitution are all explicitly forbidden by name. Paul is preaching about activities based on sexual prohibitions laid out in Leviticus in the context of achieving holiness. One theory therefore suggests that it is these behaviours, and only these, that are intended by Paul's prohibition in chapter seven. However, most mainstream Christian sources believe that porneia encompasses all forms of premarital sex. For instance, in defining porneia/fornication, Kittel and Friedrich's 1977 Theological Dictionary of the New Testament states that \\"The NT is characterized by an unconditional repudiation of all extra-marital and unnatural intercourse\\".Kittel, G (ed): Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, Volume VI, pages 579‚Äì95 Likewise, Friberg's Analytical Lexicon to the Greek New Testament defines porneia as being \\"generally, every kind of extramarital, unlawful or unnatural sexual intercourse\\".Friberg, T: Analytical Lexicon to the Greek New Testament Lee Gatiss also argues that porneia encompasses all forms of premarital sex. He states that \\"the word 'fornication' has gone out of fashion and is not in common use to describe non-marital sex. However, it is an excellent translation for porneia, which basically referred to any kind of sex outside of marriage ... This has been contested ... but the overwhelming weight of scholarship and all the available evidence from the ancient world points firmly in this direction. \\"Flee sexual immorality (porneia) and pursue self-control\\" (cf. 1 Thess 4:1‚Äì8) was the straightforward message to Christians in a sex-crazed world.\\" = Jesus and the early Church = Attitudes towards marriage and sexuality at the time of Jesus stemmed from a blend of Roman and Jewish ideas. For instance, during the lifetime of Jesus, there was a strong social disapproval among Romans of polygamy. This made its way into Judaism and early Christianity, despite the Old Testament portraying examples of this behaviour among patriarchs and kings. Jewish marriage in the time of Jesus was a two-stage process. First, there was a betrothal in which the man claimed the woman to be his only bride. Secondly, there was the marriage contract that specified what the bride and groom's families would give the couple and what the bride would obtain if she divorced. \\"At the time of Jesus, and in rural areas like Galilee, a young couple might well cohabit before the contract was signed 'in order to get acquainted'. The betrothal was held to be enough of a marriage that a divorce would be needed if the couple split up between betrothal and contract.\\" Matthew 1:19, in which the as yet unmarried Joseph considers divorcing Mary to avoid the potential scandal of her being pregnant with Jesus, alludes to this practice. The early Church's statements on marital affairs mainly concerned acceptable reasons for divorce and remarriage. Whilst Paul, in his epistles to early believers, emphasised that both celibacy and marriage were good forms of life, after his life the Church felt that celibacy was more virtuous and liberating. This focus came about because the early church was very ascetic, possibly due to the influence of Greek philosophical thought. The focus on celibacy meant that other issues relating to sexual morality for the non- celibate remained under-developed. Augustine of Hippo's views strongly influenced how later Christians thought about sex. Before becoming a Christian, he had taken a concubine in defiance of his (Christian) mother's anxious warning to him \\"not to commit fornication\\". \\"Though sinful in acting out his erotic desires, Augustine gives himself some credit, writing that \\"the single desire that dominated my search for delight was simply to love and be loved\\". Reflecting much later, he believed that the problem was that his love had \\"no restraint imposed [on it] by the exchange of mind with mind\\". Hence, pure love was perverted by its misdirection toward lust whereas a Godly relationship should focus on a loving, rational partnership instead. In his later writings, Augustine was \\"deeply suspicious of sexual passion\\" and this has influenced the outlook of all the major Christian denominations down to the present day. Augustine considered fornication to have two definitions: the first was \\"cleaving to a prostitute\\" and the second, broader and more precise one was \\"what men who do not have wives do with women who do not have husbands\\". Augustine believed fornicators were sinful because they corrupted their own selves, their image of God and the temple of God. = Mainstream Protestantism =  Lutheranism  According to Susan C. Karant-Nunn and Merry E. Wiesner-Hanks in their book, Luther on Women, Martin Luther felt that \\"The sex act was of course sinful outside of marriage.\\" In his sermon on the Epistle to the Ephesians Chapter 5, Luther stated: On another occasion, Luther wrote, \\"I... pass over the good or evil which experience offers, and confine myself to such good as Scripture and truth ascribe to marriage. It is no slight boon that in wedlock fornication and unchastity are checked and eliminated. This in itself is so great a good that it alone should be enough to induce men to marry forthwith, and for many reasons... The first reason is that fornication destroys not only the soul but also body, property, honor, and family as well. For we see how a licentious and wicked life not only brings great disgrace but is also a spendthrift life, more costly than wedlock, and that illicit partners necessarily occasion greater suffering for one another than do married folk. Beyond that it consumes the body, corrupts flesh and blood, nature, and physical constitution. Through such a variety of evil consequences God takes a rigid position, as though he would actually drive people away from fornication and into marriage. However, few are thereby convinced or converted.\\"Luther's Works volume 45:43 Exploring this matter in more depth when writing on 1 Thessalonians 4:3‚Äì5, Luther advises, \\"All young people should avoid casual sex and preserve their purity. They should resolve to strengthen themselves against lust and sexual passions by reading and meditating on a psalm or some other portion of God's Word... If your sexual appetites continually tempt you, be patient. Resist them as long as necessary, even if it takes more than a year. But above all, keep praying! If you feel that you can't stand it any longer, pray that God will give you a devout spouse with whom you can live in harmony and true love... I have known many people who, because of their crude and shameful fantasies, indulged their passion with unrestrained lust. Because of their insatiable desires, they abandoned self control, and lapsed into terrible immorality. In the end, they had to endure dreadful punishment. Blinded to the realities of married life, some of them took unsuitable mates and ended up in incompatible relationships. They got what they deserved. You must pray diligently and strive to resist the desires of your corrupt nature. Ask God to give you a Rebekah or Isaac instead of a Delilah or Samson-or someone even worse. Finding a devoted, loyal wife or husband isn‚Äôt a matter of good luck. It‚Äôs not the result of good judgment, as unbelievers think. Rather, a devout spouse is a gift from God.\\" Luther however, in contrast to his Roman Catholic opponents, believed that it was not the Church's business to define marriage law. He understood marriage to be a legal agreement rather than a sacrament. He stated that marriage was instituted by God but its regulation was the business of the State, not the Church. Luther defined marriage as \\"the God-appointed and legitimate union of man and woman in the hope of having children or at least for the purpose of avoiding fornication and sin and living to the glory of God. The ultimate purpose is to obey God, to find aid and counsel against sin; to call upon God; to seek, love, and educate children for the glory of God; to live with one's wife in the fear of God and to bear the cross...\\" Martin Bucer argued that sexual intimacy belonged in marriage and that, in marriage, the man becomes \\"the head and saviour of the wife and forms one flesh with her in order to avoid fornication and that the wife is the body and help of her husband, again to avoid fornication\\". Marriage for him, though, not only meant the avoidance of sin and procreation of children but social and emotional bonding resulting in a fellowship. As Selderhuis notes, for Bucer, \\"When people conduct themselves lasciviously, either as married or unmarried folk, they fall under divine judgement... Marriage... [is] the context in which sexual intimacy should have its place... Marriage is, after all, the only framework within which sexual desires can be legitimately satisfied.\\" Immanuel Kant, who was raised as a Pietist, considered sex before marriage to be immoral. He argued that sexual desire objectifies the person you crave and, since no logically consistent ethical rule allows you to use a person as an object, it is immoral to have sex (outside marriage). Marriage makes the difference because, in marriage, the two people give all of themselves to create a union and, thus, now have rights over each other as each now belongs to the other. As Kant himself puts it, \\"The sole condition on which we are free to make use of our sexual desires depends upon the right to dispose over the person as a whole ‚Äì over the welfare and happiness and generally over all the circumstances of that person‚Ä¶ each of them... [are obliged] to surrender the whole of their person to the other with a complete right to disposal over it.\\"Kant, I: Lectures on Ethics Today, the Lutheran Church of Australia asserts that premarital sex is sinful. It believes that sexual activity belongs within the marriage relationship only and that the practice of pre-marital sex is in \\"violation of the will of God\\". In the United States, pastors of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod undertook a survey on premarital sex among their congregations in 2010. \\"These Lutheran pastors reported that over 57 percent of the couples they now marry are living together prior to the wedding, and that the rate of cohabitation in their congregations is increasing.\\" Despite this trend, the Synod believes that \\"Regardless of the reasons given for living together, cohabitation is simply wrong for Christians.\\" The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) takes the view that \\"Any use of the gift of sex aside from the marriage bond is adultery, whether this is premarital or extramarital ... To engage in premarital or extramarital sex, before or outside of marriage, is to sin in God's sight. That is precisely the point of Hebrews 13:4, a verse often referred to in this kind of discussion. \\"Marriage\\" and the marriage bed ... go together and are to be kept pure. Using the \\"bed\\" aside from \\"marriage\\" is sin that God will judge... The counsel given in 1 Corinthians 7:9 makes the same point. If a person has sexual urges and the sex drive (a good gift from God in itself) expresses itself within a person, that person has a God-pleasing remedy identified: to be married and thus obtain the right to be sexually active. Before or outside of marriage, sinful lust is sinful lust.\\" Elsewhere on its official site, WELS states that \\"Even though our unbelieving society embraces living together outside marriage as an acceptable lifestyle, it is still a sinful arrangement. A pastor or congregation will deal patiently with cohabitating people who are seeking spiritual guidance... [and a]... Christian life of sanctification. This is done by firmly yet gently confronting them with their sin... and then guiding them to change their behavior to show their love for Christ.\\" The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) delivered a detailed document, entitled A Social Statement on Human Sexuality, in 2009. With regard to sex before marriage, the document, declares that \\"Because this church urges couples to seek the highest social and legal support for their relationships, it does not favor cohabitation arrangements outside marriage. It has a special concern when such arrangements are entered into as an end in themselves. It does, however, acknowledge the social forces at work that encourage such practices. This church also recognizes the pastoral and familial issues that accompany these contemporary social patterns. In cases where a decision is made for cohabitation, regardless of the reasons, this church expects its pastors and members to be clear with the couple regarding the reasons for the position of this church and to support the couple in recognizing their obligation to be open and candid with each other about their plans, expectations, and levels of mutual commitment. Some cohabitation arrangements can be constructed in ways that are neither casual nor intrinsically unstable... This church believes, however, that the deepest human longings for a sense of personal worth, long- term companionship, and profound security, especially given the human propensity to sin, are best served through binding commitment, legal protections, and the public accountability of marriage, especially where the couple is surrounded by the prayers of the congregational community and the promises of God.\\" The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland's stance on the issue is ambiguous. It strictly condemns extramarital sex but in relation to pre-marital sex it states only that \\"Sexuality disconnected from love and from responsibility enslaves people, bringing harm to themselves and others.\\" According to the Kinsey Institute, \\"Today, the Swedish Lutheran Church is very liberal in action, but careful not to take formal stands in most sexual issues, such as premarital sex, cohabitation, and sex education.\\" The Lutheran Church in Germany (EKD) has noted that all forms of long-term cohabitation are vulnerable and that legislators must give due recognition to the fundamental significance of marriage. The Church has further stated that \\"Marriage and family alone can be considered as role models for living together.\\" The Australian non-denominational Christian teen sex education website, \\"Boys Under Attack\\", cites Lutheran sources to assert that people should maintain virginity until marriage. The site asserts that all sexual activity ‚Äì including oral sex and mutual masturbation ‚Äì between unmarried persons is a sin.  Calvinism  Calvinism has traditionally always asserted that engaging in premarital sex is a sin. Calvin himself said little on why he thought engaged couples should not have sex and Witte believes his rationale for the prohibition was vague but he did seek to reduce the length of engagements among couples in Geneva to less than six weeks, to reduce the temptation of premarital sex. He agreed, though, with Luther that marriage was a legal matter for the state, not a sacramental matter for the church. John Witte, Jr. has written a study on John Calvin and marriage and family life. In it, he notes that, \\"For Calvin, the Commandment against adultery was equally binding on the unmarried, and equally applicable to both illicit sexual activities per se, and various acts leading to the same. Calvin condemned fornication sternly‚Äîsexual intercourse or other illicit acts of sexual touching, seduction, or enticement by non-married parties, including those who were engaged to each other or to others. He decried at length the widespread practice of casual sex, prostitution, concubinage, pre-marital sex, nonmarital cohabitation and other forms of bed hopping that he encountered in modern day Geneva as well as in ancient Bible stories. All these actions openly defied God's commandment against adultery and should be punished by spiritual and criminal sanctions. Calvin preached against fornication constantly... He often led the Consistory in rooting out fornicators and subjecting them to admonition and the ban, and to fines and short imprisonment.\\" Theodore Beza likewise strictly condemned it. Raymond A. Mentzer notes that, \\"Wherever Calvinism took root ‚Äì Geneva and France, the Low Countries and Rhine Valley, Scotland, England and New England ‚Äì an element of moral rigor... accompanied it. Churches fashioned in the Calvinist tradition have typically set extremely high standard of behavior and, more particularly, sought to compel a strict morality within the community...\\" Sin, including sexual sin, was not simply considered a private failing; it affected the whole congregation. E. William Monter asserts that, \\"The supposedly repressive dimension of Calvinist morality affected women's lives in ways which were often beneficial... Each year the [Genevan] Consistory judged a half-dozen cases of fornication by engaged couples and as many accusations of illicit sex between masters and servants.\\" In the 1560s, a consistory met for the first time in N√Æmes. The town soon had a Protestant majority but it still faced an enormous task in cleaning up morals as one of the first Protestant-controlled societies in France. According to Mentzer, one third of excommunications in N√Æmes between the 1560s and the 1580s were due to improper sexual behaviour. At this time, proper conduct was considered as much a public matter as a private matter. The struggle against worldly dissoluteness, and the enforcement of respect for the family and the pacification of society were setting N√Æmes \\"on the path towards social reform and, by extension, modernity itself.\\" As a result of this new moral rigour, there were remarkably low rates of premarital conceptions and illegitimate births among Huguenots by the seventeenth century in France compared to the rates among their Roman Catholic opponents, from whom the Reformed sought to distinguish themselves by their moral holiness. The low illegitimate birth rate indicates that the Calvinists had internalised the values that condemned premarital sex as immoral. An interesting case is that of Pierre Palma Cayet, who scandalously wrote a book in which he provided a scriptural defence of brothels, prostitution and fornication, which led to him being deposed as a Huguenot pastor. Shortly afterwards, in 1595, he re- converted to Roman Catholicism. He was readily accepted back into that church as a priest. According to scholar Nicholas Must, \\"Marriage was, in the equations of Huguenot ministers... a means to avoid promiscuity and lechery. As a result of this, many sermons that dealt with marriage were also an opportunity to announce the dangers of illicit sex while, at the same time, offering a relatively positive appraisal of conjugal sex. For instance, Jean Mestrezat declares simply that marriage is the recommended solution for illicit sexuality, since God hates all impurities, especially paillardise [sexual immorality]... In another sermon, [Pastor Jean] Daill√© provides a close hermeneutical reading of paillardise in a sermon on 1 Corinthians 10:8 when he states that it includes \\"all the species of this sin, that is to say all the faults of this nature, which are committed by any person, whether married or not, simple fornication as well as adultery\\".\\" To the Huguenot, ‚Äúsimple fornication‚Äù is a \\"grave sin\\". Throughout the centuries, French Huguenots have remained strictly opposed to fornication in all circumstances. An example is the famous French Protestant pastor, Andr√© Trocm√©, (active in the 1940s), who is on record as having been against all premarital and extramarital sex. Today, French Calvinists maintain very high ethical standards and feel themselves to be different from their French Roman Catholic neighbours, in terms of their attitudes and higher standards of behaviour, including sexual behaviour. Indeed, French Reformed Christians \\"are widely regarded as having particularly high standards of honesty and integrity\\". Even one of France's most liberal Reformed Calvinist churches, L'Oratoire du Louvre in Paris, today still condemns premarital sex, including casual sex and sex with prostitutes in all circumstances. The famous Swiss Huguenot theologian, Karl Barth, discussed sexual morality in his magnum opus, Church Dogmatics. He stated that \\"Coitus without coexistence is demonic\\"Barth, K: Church Dogmatics (\\"demonic\\", in Christianity, simply meaning any sphere that does not submit to God.) Barth goes on to state that \\"the physical sexuality of man should form an integral part of his total humanity as male or female, and that the completion of the sexual relation should be integrated into the total encounter of man and woman. All right or wrong and therefore salvation or perdition in this matter depends on whether it is viewed in isolation and abstraction or within this whole... If it is not, if physical sexuality and sex relations have their own right and authority in which man and woman and their encounter may be controlled and fulfilled, then it is a demonic business. Naturally, the command of God will always resist any such idea of sovereign physical sexuality.\\" For Barth, to engage in sex outside marriage is not only rebellious but dehumanising as it puts humans on the level of animals, driven by passion and a search for self-gratification. Furthermore, for Barth, \\"A wedding is only the regulative confirmation and legitimation of a marriage before and by society. It does not constitute a marriage.\\" Sex within marriage can be sinful as well unless it affirms the coexistence of the couple. This opens the door to a more holistic understanding of sex. However, a few modern Swiss Reformed theologians, such as Michel Cornuz, take the teleological view that premarital sex is permissible if the sexual activities take a form which respects the partner and helps the relationship grow in intimacy. These theologians hold that it is when a relationship is exploitive that it is sinful. (Hence, engaging in sex with prostitutes is always sinful as it is an exploitive relationship and does not allow the participants to grow in dignity.) This change has come about within the last two generations in Switzerland. Prior to that, the cultural norm was that the couple would not engage in sex before marriage. Hence, the modern Reformed theologians have endeavoured to meet the challenge of applying Christian teaching to this massive cultural change in Switzerland. Essentially, Cornuz and his colleagues feel that one should always be true to one's individual conscience, so if the person feels sex before marriage is sinful, that person should listen to his or her conscience and abstain. The key thing is that it is up to the couple themselves to decide if engaging in premarital sex or remaining virgins is the best way for them to reflect the love of God in their relationship. According to Mentzer, during the first fifty years of the Scottish Reformation, \\"more than two-thirds of the cases brought before the Consistory involved illicit sex... everything else paled before the apparent obsession of Scots Calvinists with sex\\". This contrasted strikingly with the data from Germany, the Netherlands and France. For the parish of Saint Andrews, fornication accounted for 47.4% of all cases heard between 1573 and 1600. 986 were charged with fornication (sexual intercourse between two single persons) and 813 with \\"fornication antenuptial\\" (sexual intercourse between two people who were engaged to each other but not yet married). Between 1595 and 1597, the fornication levels in Saint Andrews plummeted. \\"The only... explanation for the relative absence of sexual offences, improbably though it may seem, is that a... genuine \\"reformation of manners\\" took place in the burgh.\\" Mentzer and Graham argue that this focus on sex may actually be due to the Kirk's early weakness. \\"Since there is strong sentiment in Western societies today that governments should stay out of the private lives of citizens, the church courts today seem nosy or even voyeuristic to our modern eyes. But this was no all-powerful Big Brother peering into bedroom windows. Rather the Kirk's obsession with sex was more a sign of its weakness than its strength... The need to discourage illicit sexuality was accepted by nearly all powers... even when they could agree on little else.\\" Only when ministers and presbyters gradually gained a stronger position were they able to gradually turn their focus to other disciplinary breaches surrounding the Sabbath, superstitious practices, neighborly disputes and so forth. Scottish Calvinists today remain deeply opposed to any kind of sex outside marriage. In 2008, the Scottish health minister, Shona Robison noted, \\"There are deeply-held views on moral issues and cultural and lifestyle issues... The Highlands in general ... have a strong Calvinistic streak, a prudish thing that sees sex as something that happens behind closed doors and drawn curtains. As a consequence of this and because of lack of a scene for gay people, both straight and gay people are being driven out into these isolated areas to have [casual] sex.\\" The American Presbyterian Church, \\"like other Christian bodies, has viewed marriage as a prerequisite to sexual intercourse and considered sex outside marriage a sin\\". The prominent conservative American Calvinist theologian, R. C. Sproul, opposes premarital sex on the grounds that the marriage covenant is an essential legal safeguard, protecting both members of the couple from each other's sinfulness. Excerpted from  Anglicanism  The official resolutions of the Anglican Church are produced by the bishops in attendance at the Lambeth Conferences, which are held every ten years. The 1988 Lambeth Conference made this declaration in its Resolution on Marriage and Family: \\"Noting the gap between traditional Christian teaching on pre-marital sex, and the life-styles being adopted by many people today, both within and outside the Church: (a) calls on provinces and dioceses to adopt a caring and pastoral attitude to such people; (b) reaffirms the traditional biblical teaching that sexual intercourse is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship; (c) in response to the International Conference of Young Anglicans in Belfast, urges provinces and dioceses to plan with young people programmes to explore issues such as pre-marital sex in the light of traditional Christian values\\" (Resolution 34). A subsequent resolution was made at the 1998 Lambeth Conference. This sitting of the Conference resolved, \\"In view of the teaching of Scripture, [the Anglican Church] upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage\\" (Resolution I.10). This Resolution also commended a report on human sexuality entitled Called to Full Humanity which stated that, \\"The Holy Scriptures and Christian tradition teach that human sexuality is intended by God to find its rightful and full expression between a man and a woman in the covenant of marriage, established by God in creation, and affirmed by our Lord Jesus Christ. Holy Matrimony is, by intention and divine purpose, to be a lifelong, monogamous and unconditional commitment between a woman and a man. The Lambeth Conference 1978 and 1998 both affirmed 'marriage to be sacred, instituted by God and blessed by our Lord Jesus Christ'. The New Testament and Christian history identify singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like ways of living.\\" Historically, the English reformers had taken a stern view of adultery and fornication, which Homily 11 of the First Book of Homilies (1547) defined to include \\"all unlawfull use of those parts, which bee ordeyned for generation\\". Prior to the Marriage Act 1753 (commonly known as the Hardwicke Act), British couples could live together and have sex after their betrothal or \\"the spousals\\". Theologian Adrian Thatcher claims that, before the Act was introduced, in the United Kingdom the betrothal was a formal, preliminary stage of marriage involving vows. During this stage, the marriage would become permanent and indissoluble if sexual intercourse occurred or when final vows were taken, whichever came first. Either of these would render \\"the conditional promise unconditional\\". Hence, having sex would automatically turn the betrothal into a finalized, indissoluble marriage.Living Together Betrothal vows were given in the future tense, hence sexual intercourse \\"activated\\" them, signalling the beginning of the binding marriage. The Council of Trent in the Roman Catholic Church and the above-mentioned Marriage Act in the United Kingdom eliminated the tradition of the betrothal stage of marriage. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches, betrothal still exists but it has been combined into the wedding ceremony, rather than remaining as its own separate stage of the marriage process. Thatcher notes that, today, \\"Non- nuptial cohabitation is unlikely ever to be thought consistent with Christian faith if only because God wills only what is best for us, and there [are] good reasons for thinking that these arrangements are not the best for us.\\" He outlines some of the damage he believes is caused by cohabitation outside marriage in his paper, supported by empirical data. In the United Kingdom, whilst the State defined who was married, it was the Anglican Church that was given the responsibility to police this law for the State. Today, Britain remains abnormal among European nations in having Church weddings whereas most other nations on that continent insist on civil registrations leaving it up to the couple if they choose to have a religious ceremony as well. The 1984 English Anglican booklet Forward to Marriage showed a tolerance of premarital sex but strongly endorsed marriage as \\"a necessary commitment for a long-term relationship\\". In 1987, the American Bishop John Shelby Spong's Newark Diocese had commissioned a report that concluded that the \\"Episcopal Church should recognize and bless committed non-marital sexual relationships between homosexuals, young adults, the divorced and widowed...\\" The report aimed \\"to ignite a new debate on sexual ethics among leaders of the nation's 3 million Episcopalians in the hope that they will amend church doctrine to embrace all believers... Spong, an advocate of the recommendations... said his views are a minority position in the church.\\" Also in 1987, the General Synod of the Church of England asserted \\"(1) that sexual intercourse is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship, (2) that fornication and adultery are sins against this ideal, and are to be met by a call to repentance and the exercise of compassion\\". The 1996 National Church Life Survey in Australia found that Australian Anglicans were more liberal about premarital sex than churchgoers from other denominations but more conservative than the general [non-church going] population. The survey noted a divide between Anglicans who wanted to support sexually active unmarried couples in their churches and others who did not. A 2009 survey found that Anglicans (along with Baptists, Roman Catholics and Uniting Church members) had become a little more accepting of premarital sex compared to a 1993 survey, whereas Pentecostal Christians had become markedly more conservative. 54% of Australian church attenders felt pre-marital sex was always or almost always wrong, whereas only 3% of non-church attenders thought it was always or usually wrong. Among those who attended church on a weekly basis, the percentage of those who thought pre-marital sex was always or almost always wrong rose to 67%. A 2002 survey by the Church Times in England found that less than half of the 5,000 readers questioned said it was wrong for men and women to have sex before they married. Over 25% also said it was acceptable for a couple to live together without ever intending to marry. The 2003 report, Cohabitation: A Christian Reflection, produced by the Diocese of Southwark, found that the Church's traditional teaching that sex before marriage is wrong has been inherited from a different form of society than that which exists today. However, the report then cited research that illustrates the problems that accompany cohabitation, particularly with regard to raising children. It concluded that marriage is \\"a much more satisfactory social convention than cohabitation\\", but says that the Church has failed to present marriage in a way that captures the imagination of young people and that the Church needed to rise to the challenge and rediscover its confidence in marriage. The report noted that Paul gave a \\"cautious welcome\\" to marriage, but that there was also a \\"militant apostolic view\\" that favoured celibacy, which \\"was seen as more noble than marriage\\" by many early Christians. The report also noted that \\"the strict sexual codes of the earliest Christian communities helped to give them a separate identity distinct from the sexual hedonism of the pagan world.\\" The report ultimately rejected the possibility that cohabitation with no intention to marry is acceptable for members of the Christian Church. In a 2004 interview, the Anglican Primate of Australia, Archbishop Peter Carnley, noted that heterosexual de facto relationships and a disinclination to commit were more serious worries for him than the same-sex marriage movement. When asked if he thought sexual morality was subjective, he disagreed, stating \\"I think it's possible to say, for example, that it is objectively quite clear that promiscuity is a bad thing.\\" In 2009, N. T. Wright noted that, in popular discourse, there has been a \\"supposed modern and scientific discovery of a personal 'identity' characterised by sexual preference, which then generates a set of 'rights'... Without entering into discussion of the scientific evidence, it must be said that the Christian notion of personal identity has never before been supposed to be rooted in desires of whatever sort. Indeed, desires are routinely brought under the constraints of 'being in Christ'. This quite new notion of an 'identity' found not only within oneself but within one's emotional and physical desires needs to be articulated on the basis of scripture and tradition, and this to my mind has not been done... The church has never acknowledged that powerful sexual instincts, which almost all human beings have, generate a prima facie 'right' that these instincts receive physical expression. All are called to chastity and, within that, some are called to celibacy; but a call to celibacy is not the same thing as discovering that one has a weak or negligible sexual drive. The call to the self-control of chastity is for all: for the heterosexually inclined who, whether married or not, are regularly and powerfully attracted to many different potential partners, just as much as for those with different instincts.\\" On another occasion, Wright stated, \\"We need to remind ourselves that the entire biblical sexual ethic is deeply counter-intuitive. All human beings some of the time, and some human beings most of the time, have deep heartfelt longings for kinds of sexual intimacy or gratification (multiple partners, pornography, whatever) which do not reflect the creator's best intentions for his human creatures, intentions through which new wisdom and flourishing will come to birth. Sexual restraint is mandatory for all, difficult for most, extremely challenging for some. God is gracious and merciful but this never means that his creational standards don't really matter after all.\\" The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, and the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, have expressed tolerance of cohabitation. In 2011, John Sentamu, commenting on Prince William and Catherine's decision to live together before their wedding, said that the royal couple's public commitment to live their lives together today would be more important than their past. Sentamu said that he had conducted wedding services for \\"many cohabiting couples\\" during his time as a vicar in south London. Rowan Williams stated he did not personally believe sex outside marriage to be a sin and noted in 2002 that he found it hard to reconcile his liberal personal beliefs with the public stance of the Church. However, in 2008, Doctor Williams said, \\"Sex outside marriage is not as God purposes it... I always find it difficult to condense sexual ethics into a soundbite... All I can say is where the Church stands ‚Äì it's not a question of what Rowan Williams's view is... the biblical view of sexual relations is consistently within the pattern of absolute mutual commitment, reflecting God's commitment to his people. And the assumption of the Bible is that that commitment is heterosexual. That is the framework we work in.\\" In his earlier 1997 essay, \\"Forbidden Fruit: New Testament Sexual Ethics\\", Dr Williams had noted, \\"I can't see that the New Testament easily allows any straightforwardly positive evaluation of sexual intimacy outside a relationship that is publicly committed [in marriage].\\" In 2013, Doctor Williams' successor, Justin Welby, stated that \\"My understanding of sexual ethics has been that, regardless of whether it's gay or straight, sex outside marriage is wrong.\\" He reiterated this belief again later in 2013, further noting that, \\"To abandon the ideal simply because it's difficult to achieve is ridiculous.\\" After Welby made his first statement, a Sunday Times poll found that \\"A majority of adults (69%, including 76% of those professing no faith) believe Justin Welby to be wrong in condemning sex outside marriage, while 17% think he is right (including 30% of Anglicans), and 13% are unsure.\\" The Kinsey Institute comments that The 2013 British Social Attitudes survey found that members of the Church of England have become more accepting of pre-marital sex over the past 30 years. In 1983, 31% of British Anglicans surveyed thought that pre-marital sex was \\"always\\" or \\"mostly\\" wrong whereas, in 2012, only 10% thought this was the case. Likewise, in 1989, 78% of Anglicans surveyed thought that people should marry before having children. In 2012, this had declined to 54%.  Methodism  The American Methodist theologian and pastor, Ben Witherington III, believes that \\"virginity in a woman was highly valued before marriage [in Biblical cultures]... In early Jewish law if you had sex with a woman you were considered married to her or you had shamed her. See the story of Mary and Joseph. Porneia can refer to all sorts of sexual sin including deflowering a virgin... there was no dating or physical intimacy prior to an arranged marriage in the vast majority of cases. The notion of dating doesn't exist in Jesus and Paul's world. Second, honor and shame cultures placed a high value on sexual purity. Notice how prostitutes were stigmatized. Women were mainly blamed for sexual immorality. Finally Jesus gave his disciples two choices in Mt. 19‚Äîfidelity in heterosexual marriage or being a eunuch! This means no sex outside marriage.\\" The position of the United Methodist Church in the United States on the issue is as follows: \\"Although all persons are sexual beings whether or not they are married, sexual relations are only clearly affirmed in the marriage bond.\\" The Uniting Church in Australia is still formulating its views on the subject. It recognises the changes in marriage practice and lifestyle that have resonated throughout society and that the UCA is perceived by the public of being more accepting of the realities of humanity than many other denominations. A report noted that scripture is not really about marriage as understood in contemporary western societies and, in fact, has very little to say about it. In the report, the church also acknowledged that many unmarried people had sex but neither condemned nor endorsed it, instead noting that there were many different views within the church. Stanley Hauerwas argues that questions about sex before marriage need to be reframed in terms of the narrative of the church. He asks individuals to consider if it is a pure or licentious lifestyle that will best prepare the Christian to live out and serve in the narrative of the church. Doctor Hauerwas goes on to conclude, \\"For the issue is not whether X or Y form of sexual activity is right or wrong, as if such activity could be separated from a whole way of life... The issue is not whether someone is chaste in the sense of not engaging in genital activity, but whether we have lived in a manner that allows us to bring a history with us that contributes to the common history we may be called upon to develop with one another. Chastity, we forget, is not a state but a form of the virtue of faithfulness that is necessary for a role in the community... what the young properly demand is an account of life and the initiation into a community that makes intelligible why their interest in sex should be subordinated to other interests. What they, and we, demand is the lure of an adventure that captures the imagination sufficiently that conquest means more than the sexual possession of another. I have tried to suggest that marriage and singleness for Christians should represent just such an adventure, and if it does not, no amount of ethics or rules will be sufficient to correct the situation.\\"Hauerwas, S: A Community of Character: Toward a Constructive Christian Social Ethic = Mennonites = Mennonites believe that sex outside marriage is sinful. The Mennonite Confession of Faith states \\"According to Scripture, right sexual union takes place only within the marriage relationship. Scripture places sexual intimacy within God's good created order. Sexual union is reserved for the marriage bond.\\" = Quakers = Quakers are essentially non-judgemental about sex and relationships outside marriage.BBC ‚Äì Religions ‚Äì Christianity: Quakers . 3 July 2009. Retrieved 8 February 2018. = Catholicism = Catholicism equates premarital sex with fornication and ties it with breaking the sixth commandment (\\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\\") in its Catechism: > Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. > It is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality > which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses and the generation and > education of children. Moreover, it is a grave scandal when there is > corruption of the young. In his book, James F. Keenan reports studies by some academics. A study by Bernard Hoose states that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are \\"simply not true\\". After examining seven medieval text about homosexuality, Mark Jordan argues that, \\"far from being consistent, any attempt to make a connection among the texts proved impossible\\". He calls the tradition's teaching of the Church \\"incoherent\\". Karl-Wilhelm Merks considers that tradition itself is \\"not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.\\" Keenan, however, says that studies of \\"manualists\\" such as John T. Noonan Jr. has demonstrated that, \\"despite claims to the contrary, manualists were co-operators in the necessary historical development of the moral tradition.\\" Noonan, according to Keenan, has provided a new way of viewing at \\"areas where the Church not only changed, but shamefully did not\\". The Catholic Church did not pro-actively condemn men for pre-marital sex until the twelfth century. The Third Council of Aachen had previously noted that it was almost unheard of for a man to remain a virgin until his wedding but males remained largely immune to punishment whereas females were heavily penalized for sexual misdemeanours. Despite the Church's disapproval of nonmarital sex, fornication continued to be commonplace in the early medieval period. In the twelfth century, the Paris-based \\"Reform Church\\" movement was a Catholic faction that attempted to refocus society's moral compass with a particular emphasis on sex and marriage. The movement sent priests to Wales where it was, up until that time, the norm for Christians to live together prior to marriage. Up until this period, marriage was considered a private contract between two people. They would make a pledge to each other and, from that moment on, they were considered married. This pledge could take place anywhere; it did not have to occur in a church and neither the church nor the state were involved. It was during the twelfth century that the Catholic Church took control of the process of marriage. From that point on, to be legally recognised, a marriage had to take place in a church with a formal service conducted by a priest. Hence all marriage and sexual activity now came under the control of the Church. At the time of the Reformation, the Catholic Church \\"officially advocated celibacy for the religious, and prohibited marriage, but allowed fornication and concubinage\\". For instance, in 1527 all but 10 out of 200 Catholic clergymen in Thuringia were living with women outside marriage. The Council of Trent (which began in 1545 in reaction to the Protestant Reformation) formally ratified the Catholic view that marriage was a sacrament and set strict guidelines around what constituted a legitimate marriage in Catholic eyes. In his 1930 encyclical, Casti connubii, Pope Pius XI strongly condemned premarital sex and all forms of \\"experimental\\" marriage. The Catholic belief that premarital sex is sinful was reasserted in Pope John Paul II's 1993 encyclical, Veritatis Splendor. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI claimed that premarital sex and cohabitation were \\"gravely sinful\\" and \\"damaging to the stability of society\\". The Catholic Church continues to teach that premarital sex is disordered and sinful and believes that sexual relations are only acceptable between a married couple. The 2012 British Social Attitudes survey showed that only one in ten British Catholics and Anglicans thought that pre-marital sex was wrong (however, of those who attended church on a weekly basis, only 23% thought it was permissible). A 1994 study of French Catholics showed that 83% preferred to listen to their consciences rather than to the official position of the Catholic Church when making major decisions in their lives, leading to 75% of Catholics, by 2003, to say that cohabitation outside marriage is a personal matter and 13% to say whether it is right or not depends on circumstances. A 2004 survey showed vastly different attitudes among Catholics in different nations. For instance, in Germany, 76% of Catholics agreed or strongly agreed that cohabitation before marriage was acceptable. In Spain, that number was 72%, in the Czech Republic it was 66% and in France it was 62%. At the other end of the spectrum, only 32% of Australian Catholics thought it was acceptable, followed by 39% in the Philippines and 43% in the United States. The same survey sought to show the number of Catholics who believed that premarital sex is \\"not wrong at all\\" or \\"wrong only sometimes\\". In the Czech Republic, 84% of Catholics believed this, in France it was 83% and in Germany it was 80%. At the other end of the scale, in the Philippines it was 21%, in Ireland it was 51% and in Australia and the United States it was 64%. The survey also claimed that 40% of Catholic women in the United States have cohabited outside marriage. The 2013 British Social Attitudes survey showed that Catholics have become even more accepting than Anglicans of having children outside wedlock: in 1989, 73% of British Catholics thought people should marry before having children; whereas, by 2012, just 43% thought so. A 2014 survey showed that most German Catholics also disputed the Church's ruling against premarital sex. = Evangelicalism = In his book Forbidden Fruit: Sex & Religion in the Lives of American Teenagers, sociologist Mark Regnerus notes that \\"Evangelical Christian teens are more likely to have lost their virginity earlier than mainline Protestants. They start having sex on average at age 16.3 and are more likely than other religious groups to have had three or more sexual partners by age 17.\\" A 2012 study, the National Survey of Reproductive and Contraceptive Knowledge, found that 80% of young American evangelical Christians aged between 18 and 29 are having pre-marital sex. A 2012 survey found 56% of unmarried evangelical Christians between the ages of 18 and 29 were never sexually active. Unlike previous studies, this survey did not rely on respondents simply identifying themselves as \\"evangelical\\" but also had to attend a Protestant church at least once a month, believe that they will go to heaven when they die because they have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior, strongly agree that the Bible is the written word of God and is accurate in all that it teaches, that their personal commitment to Jesus Christ is still important to their lives today, that eternal salvation is possible only through Jesus Christ, and that they personally have a responsibility to tell others about their religious beliefs. The same survey also found higher religiosity, as measured by frequency of Bible reading, was correlated with a lower rate of non-marital sexual activity. A 2014 press release from online dating websites announced the results of a poll of 2,600 Americans in their attitudes towards dating and sex. The poll found that 61 percent of Christians believed they would have sex before marriage. Fifty-six percent found it appropriate to cohabit with a romantic partner after dating for a time between six months and two years.  American Baptists  The American Baptist pastor and assistant professor, Jennifer Knust, believes that the Bible is contradictory on the subject of premarital sex and that some Bible texts, notably the Book of Ruth, present it as a source of God's blessing.  Southern Baptist convention  A 2013 study of 151 newly married young adults at nine Southern Baptist churches in Texas found that over 70% of respondents reported having had premarital vaginal or oral sex. The Southern Baptist scholar Frank Stagg interpreted the New Testament as saying that sex is reserved for marriage.Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. Woman in the World of Jesus. Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978. He maintained that the New Testament teaches that sex outside marriage is a sin of adultery if either sexual participant is married, otherwise the sin of fornication if both sexual participants are unmarried. The Southern Baptists' Ethics and Religious Liberties Commission also condemns premarital sex on the grounds of their interpretation of the Bible. Feeling that marriage is a \\"divine institution\\" the Southern Baptist position is closer to that of Roman Catholic sacramentalism than that of Luther and Calvin who maintained marriage was a legal agreement and the business of the State.  Pentecostals  In Australia, Pentecostals are increasingly opposed to the concept of premarital sex. In 1993, 62% of Australian Pentecostals felt that sex before marriage was wrong. By 2009, that figure had jumped to 78%. Other faiths = Bah√°'√≠ = Bah√°'√≠s are required to be \\"absolutely chaste\\" before marriage. To Bah√°'√≠s this means not only abstaining from fornication, but also abstaining from hugging and kissing before marriage. The most holy book of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, punishes fornication with fines which double with every offense (as in the wheat and chessboard problem). The Arabic word used in the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas for this sin is zina, which can refer to either fornication or adultery, depending on context, but \`Abdu'l-Bah√° has clarified that in this context the word zina refers to fornication. \`Abdu'l-Bah√° further states that the purpose of this punishment is to shame and disgrace fornicators in the eyes of society. = Buddhism = Buddhism disapproves of extramarital sex and adultery, which is considered sexual misconduct. The precepts of Buddhism denounces fornication for the monastics. Sexual activities between lay people however are left to their own discretion so long as it is not sexual misconduct such as adultery: fornication in itself is not considered sexual misconduct. = Hinduism = Hindu texts present a range of views on sex. The hymn 4.5.5 of the Rigveda calls adultery as pƒÅpa (evil, sin). According to the Indologist Wendy Doniger, the Vedic texts, including the Rigveda, the Atharvaveda and the Upanishads, also acknowledge the existence of male lovers and female lovers as a basic fact of human life, followed by the recommendation that one should avoid such extra marital sex during certain ritual occasions (yajna). A number of simile in the Rigveda, states Doniger, a woman's emotional eagerness to meet her lover is described, and one hymn prays to the gods that they protect the embryo of a pregnant wife as she sleeps with her husband and other lovers. Mandagadde Rama Jois translates verse 4.134 of Manusmriti as declaring adultery to be a heinous offense, and prescribes severe punishments. The verse 8.362 of Manusmriti exempts the rules on adultery for women who earn their own livelihood or are wives of traveling performances, where the woman enters into sexual liaisons on her own volition or with the encouragement of the husband. The Manusmriti, states Doniger offers two views on adultery. It recommends a new married couple to remain sexually faithful to each other for life. It also accepts that adulterous relationships happen, children are born from such relationships and then proceeds to reason that the child belongs to the legal husband of the pregnant woman, and not to the biological father. Other dharmasastra texts describe adultery as a punishable crime but differ significantly in the details. For example, adultery is not a punishable offence if \\"the woman's husband has abandoned her because she is wicked, or he is eunuch, or of a man who does not care, provided the wife initiates it of her own volition\\", states Indologist Richard Lariviere. According to Ramanathan and Weerakoon, in Hinduism, the sexual matters are left to the judgment of those involved and not a matter to be imposed through law.; Quote: \\"In this [Hinduism] doctrine, sexual matters are not to be legislated but are left to the judgment of those involved, subject to community laws and customs.\\" The Kamasutra, a Hindu text on love and sex, Vatsyayana discusses the merits of adultery. For example, states Ariel Glucklich, the sexual liaison is taught as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, working against his enemies and facilitating his successes. It also explains the many signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into a sexual relationship outside of marriage, and when she does not want to commit adultery. Other Hindu texts present a more complex model of behavior and mythology where gods commit adultery for various reasons. For example, states Wendy Doniger, Krishna commits adultery and the Bhagavata Purana justifies it as something to be expected when Vishnu took a human form, just like sages become uncontrolled. According to Tracy Coleman, Radha and other gopis are indeed lovers of Krishna, but this is prema or \\"selfless, true love\\" and not carnal craving. In Hindu texts, this relationship between gopis and Krishna involves secret nightly rendezvous. Some texts state it to be divine adultery, others as a symbolism of spiritual dedication and religious value. = Islam = In traditional Islamic law unlawful sexual intercourse is called zinƒÅ æ () or zina ( or ). Classification of homosexual intercourse as zina differs according to legal school. The Quran disapproved of the promiscuity prevailing in Arabia at the time, and several verses refer to unlawful sexual intercourse, including one that prescribes the punishment of 100 lashes for those who did ¬´ Zina ¬ª. Four witnesses are required to prove the offense. Zina thus belong to the class of hadd (pl. hudud) crimes which have Quranically specified punishments. Although Stoning for Zina is not mentioned in the Quran, all schools of traditional jurisprudence agreed on the basis of hadith that it is to be punished by stoning if the offender commits adultery and is muhsan (adult, free, Muslim, and having been married), with some extending this punishment to certain other cases and milder punishment prescribed in other scenarios. The offenders must have acted of their own free will. According to traditional jurisprudence, Zina must be proved by testimony of four eyewitnesses to the actual act of penetration, or a confession repeated four times and not retracted later. The Maliki legal school also allows an unmarried woman's pregnancy to be used as evidence, but the punishment can be averted by a number of legal \\"semblances\\" (shubuhat), such as existence of an invalid marriage contract. Rape was traditionally prosecuted under different legal categories which used normal evidentiary rules. Making an accusation of zina without presenting the required eyewitnesses is called qadhf (), which is itself a hadd crime.DeLong-Bas, Wahhabi Islam, 2004: 89‚Äì90 = Judaism = The Torah explicitly forbids adultery. All women were expected to be virgins upon marriage. In the case they were found not to be by a betrothed husband, the punishment was death if the man to whom she married was not the man to whom she lost her virginity. Also if a man and a virgin had sex prior to marriage, then they were forced to marry.Deuteronomy 22:13‚Äì29 To quote two sources, \\"The Torah does not outlaw it‚Äîas it does many other types of sexual relationships‚Äîand the child of such a union is not considered a mamzer (illegitimate). Nonetheless, marital sex is considered ideal, and premarital sex is traditionally not approved of. The negative attitude toward premarital sex, to a large degree, reflects the overwhelmingly positive attitude toward sex within marriage.\\" Likewise, \\"The only limits placed on sexual activities in the Torah are prohibitions against adultery and incest. In Biblical times, a man was not prohibited from having sexual relations with a woman, as long as it led to marriage. The Bible never explicitly states a woman and man may not have sexual intercourse prior to marriage; therefore, no sanction was imposed for premarital sex, but it was considered a violation of custom.\\" Orthodox Jews are opposed to premarital sex see Leviticus 19:22. See also: Forbidden relationships in Judaism = Sikhism = Sikhism condemns any type of adultery and pre-marital sex. This falls under the Sikh tenet of kaam, which translates to lust or greed.  Across history, cultures, and laws  A survey undertaken by the American Sociological Review between 2000 and 2008 covering 31 developing countries found that \\"94 percent of Jews... reported having premarital sex, compared to 79 percent of Christians, 65 percent of Buddhists, 43 percent of Muslims and 19 percent of Hindus.\\" =Roman Empire= During the sixth century, Emperor Justinian formulated legislation that was to become the basis of Western marriage law for the next millennium. Under his laws, cohabiting couples were no longer recognised as married and their children were regarded as illegitimate, with the same status as the children of prostitutes. However, the status of illegitimate children could be updated if the parents later married. =Great Britain= In the 1170s, \\"it was common practice for ordinary couples to cohabit before marriage and for cousins to marry one another\\" and there was very little stigma around bastards at any social level in medieval England. For instance, William the Conqueror's right to succeed to the throne of Normandy was never questioned on the grounds he was a bastard nor, in his conflict with Harold Godwinson over who should rule England, was this issue raised as an argument against him. However, attitudes shifted a few generations later when bastards were no longer able to claim the English throne. During the ascendancy of the Puritans, an Act for suppressing the detestable sins of Incest, Adultery and Fornication was passed by the English Council of State in 1650. At the Restoration in 1660, this statute was not renewed, and prosecution of the mere act of fornication itself was abandoned. However, notorious and open lewdness, when carried to the extent of exciting public scandal, continued to be an indictable offence at common law, however fornication in a private sense was not illegal. Prior to the passing of the Marriage Act 1753, laws against bastard children became more strict during the 1730s and 1740s. In the Victorian era, however, the English working class continued to have a different set of sexual mores from the upper-middle and upper classes. Premarital intercourse was considered acceptable for the working class but only after an extended period of courtship and occurred infrequently even then. The couple were expected to marry, though. Disgrace only arose if the female became pregnant and the couple did not marry. = United States = Ethical issues arising from sexual relations between consenting heterosexuals who have reached the age of consent have generally been viewed as matters of private morality, and so, have not generally been prosecuted as criminal offenses in the common law.Jim Thompson, The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science, Vol. 49, No. 4 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 1958), pp. 350‚Äì356 This legal position was inherited by the United States from the United Kingdom. Later, some jurisdictions, a total of 16 in the southern and eastern United States, as well as the states of WisconsinJim Thompson, The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science, Vol. 49, No. 4 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 1958), pp. 350‚Äì356, 353 and Utah, passed statutes creating the offense of fornication that prohibited (vaginal) sexual intercourse between two unmarried people of the opposite sex. Most of these laws either were repealed or were struck down by the courts in several states as being odious to their state constitutions. See also State v. Saunders, 381 A.2d 333 (N.J. 1977), Martin v. Ziherl, 607 S.E.2d 367 (Va. 2005). , the only states in America whose law bans fornication are Idaho and Mississippi, with North Carolina having a slightly more involved but still relevant law stating, ‚Äúif any man and woman, not being married to each other, shall lewdly and lasciviously associate, bed and cohabit together, they shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.\\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best- states/articles/2020-03-05/virginia-repeals-law-banning-sex-before-marriage Some acts of fornication were prohibited under criminal laws defining the offense of sodomy, rather than the laws defining the offense of fornication. However, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) rendered the states' remaining laws related to sodomy unenforceable. Lawrence v. Texas is also presumed by many to invalidate laws prohibiting fornication: the decision declared sodomy laws unconstitutional, saying that they interfered with private, consensual, non-commercial intimate relations between unrelated adults, and therefore were odious to the rights of liberty and privacy, such rights being retained by the people of the United States. = Australia = A 2003 survey reported that most non-religious Australians thought that premarital sex was acceptable. It showed that there was a correlation between liberalism, education levels, lack of religious beliefs and a permissive attitude to premarital sex. = Islamic nations = In some Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Sudan, and Yemen, any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal. Aside from \\"a few rare and isolated\\" instances from the pre-modern era and several recent cases, there is no historical record of stoning for zina being legally carried out. Zina became a more pressing issue in modern times, as Islamist movements and governments employed polemics against public immorality. During the Algerian Civil War, Islamist insurgents assassinated women suspected of loose morals, the Taliban have executed suspected adultresses using machine guns, and zina has been used as justification for honor killings. After sharia-based criminal laws were widely replaced by European-inspired statutes in the modern era, in recent decades several countries passed legal reforms that incorporated elements of hudud laws into their legal codes. Iran witnessed several highly publicized stonings for zina in the aftermath the Islamic revolution. In Nigeria local courts have passed several stoning sentences, all of which were overturned on appeal or left unenforced. In Pakistan, the Hudood Ordinances of 1979 subsumed prosecution of rape under the category of zina, departing from traditional judicial practice, and making rape extremely difficult to prove while exposing the victims to jail sentences for admitting illicit intercourse. Although these laws were amended in 2006, they still blur the legal distinction between rape and consensual sex. According to human rights organizations, stoning for zina has also been carried out in Saudi Arabia.

His sonnets were influenced by the movement of modernismo. Received his early education in the home of Petra and Carlota Gonz√°lez, neighbors of Manicuare. Then moved to Cuman√° entering in the school of Pedro Luis Cede√±o, and attends high school in the Federal Lyceum, in the same city. In 1910 travels to Caracas and begins to study political science in the Central University of Venezuela. By 1911 wrote his first sonnet Cielo y Mar (Sky and Sea) dedicated to his friend, the poet Jos√© Antonio Ramos Sucre. In addition, contributes in publications such as: Satiric√≥n, La U, Claros del Alba, √âlite, Renacimiento, El Universal, El Nuevo Diario and Broche de Oro. Two years later is diagnosed with leprosy. Doctors advise him to return to Manicuare to avoid a medical isolation. Salmer√≥n continued in his studies despite the warning. But in 1913, returns to his hometown after the closing of the university by the government of Juan Vicente G√≥mez. After his return, his sister Encarnaci√≥n dies, and his brother Anto√±ico was killed by the civil chief of the town. Because of this, Salmer√≥n decides to confront the authority and was jailed for a year in Cuman√°. Then comes back to Manicuare, refuging in a small house built especially for him. There he would spend his last fifteen years. During the month of July, 1929, Manicuare suffers a severe drought. After his death on 30 July, in the town rains again. This coincidence has become part of the heritage of the region, popularly expressed in songs like Canci√≥n Cumanesa, of singer-songwriter Al√≠ Primera. A compilation of his work was published in 1952 entitled as Fuente de Amargura (Bitterness Fountain). In 1983, film director Jacobo Penzo made a movie based on his life: La Casa de Agua (The House of Water). In his honor was named the municipality where is Manicuare.

She went to Paris in the Spring of 1928 and proclaimed herself to be a silent film star who had worked in Berlin. Together with her husband, Maximilian Abramowicz, and her brother, Alexander, the trio claimed to be working on a film which required multiple portraits as part of the plot. She befriended Jean Cocteau who enthusiastically endorsed the project and with his encouragement, fifty- nine artists made portraits of her. A limited edition book about Lani and the portraits was published in 1929 by √âditions des Quatre Chemins, Paris with essays by Cocteau, Mac Ramo, and Waldemar George. It included fifty-one plates of reproductions. The film never materialized, but the portraits were exhibited as a group in Europe and the United States, and Lani and Abramowicz kept them in their possession.

It gained international attention for successfully hitchhiking across Canada, Germany and the Netherlands, but in 2015 its attempt to hitchhike across the United States ended prematurely when the robot was stripped and decapitated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Description  Original hitchBOT in collections. Smith, who had hitchhiked across Canada 3 times, and Zeller had \\"designed the robot to learn about how people interact with technology and ask the question, 'Can robots trust human beings?'\\" The robot was not able to walk it completed its \\"hitchhiking\\" journeys by \\"asking\\" to be carried by those who picked it up. The robot was able to carry on basic conversation and talk about facts, and was designed to be a robotic travelling companion while in the vehicle of the driver who picked it up. As a social experiment, it was also given social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The robot had a cylindrical body composed mainly of a plastic bucket, with two flexible \\"arms\\" and two flexible \\"legs\\" attached to the torso. The top section of the body was transparent, containing a screen which displayed eyes and a mouth, making the robot approximately humanoid in external appearance. It was small and had a look the team described as \\"yard-sale chic\\", to evoke trust and empathy, and had a child's car seat base to be easily and safely transportable. It was powered either by solar power or by cigarette lighter sockets in cars. It had a GPS device and a 3G connection, which allowed researchers to track its location. It was equipped with a camera, which took photographs periodically to document its journeys.  Travels  The robot's \\"hitchhiking\\" was reported by the press in many countries. From July 27, 2014 to August 21, 2014, it hitchhiked across Canada from the Institute for Applied Creativity at NSCAD University Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Victoria, British Columbia. At a First Nations powwow, it was given a name translating as \\"Iron Woman\\". The robot was so popular that its GPS had to be disabled sometimes to prevent crowds bothering those who took it into their homes. A second hitchBOT machine was made, and in February 2015 it hitchhiked around Germany for 10 days. For 3 weeks in June 2015, it hitched around the Netherlands. HitchBOT then attempted to cross the United States from Boston to San Francisco starting on July 17, 2015. After 2 weeks, on August 1, 2015 however, a photo was tweeted, showing that the robot had been stripped and decapitated in Philadelphia. The head was never found. On August 3, 2015 Adam Gabbatt reported on the Guardian website about hitchBOT's destruction. Frauke Zeller, co-creator of hitchBOT, was quoted saying: \\"We can see on all our data that the tablet and battery and everything shut off at the same time so it must have been when they vandalised the bot.\\" The article also states: > She said Hitchbot‚Äôs body had been found by some good samaritans who had > located the roving robot through a regularly updated map on its website. > \\"They sent us images and it‚Äôs really beyond repair. There‚Äôs not a single > wire inside and all the things are broken.\\"  Legacy  hitchBOT's ordeal highlighted the issues of autonomous technology, the ethics of robot treatment, and the anthropomorphism of animate-like devices. The first hitchBOT is now a permanent exhibit at the Canada Science and Technology Museum. Smith and Zeller recreated their invention as hitchBOT 2.0 in 2019. The robot was sent to Paris, France, where it is touring about and appearing in a play, Killing Robots, written by Linda Blanchet.\\"It‚Äôs hitchBOT 2.0. The hitchhiking robot left for dead on a U.S. street in 2015 is back ‚Äî on stage in France\\".

Foundation The town of Chamb√©ry had a collection of art in one of the rooms of the H√¥tel de Ville (Town Hall), open to the public in 1783. This first collection was expanded during the 19th century. Hector Garriod Baron (1803‚Äì1883) gave 104 paintings to the town between 1863 and 1878. When he died, 140 works from his collection were bequeathed on condition that they were assembled in a museum. The municipality charged the architect Fran√ßois Pelaz with converting the former granary at the entrance to the town into the new museum. The people of Chamb√©ry had been invited to talk about the annexation of Savoy to France (1860 Treaty of Turin) on the ground floor of this building. The library was inaugurated on 14 July 1889 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the department in the French Revolution. History From this starting point, the municipality continued to collect and safeguard works of art. In 1905 it bought the domain of Charmettes, the childhood home of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1911 the Mus√©e Savoisien was established in the buildings of the bishop's palace, awarded to the city following the law of separation of Church and State. In 1958 some work was undertaken by the conservator Pierre Amiet. The library was relocated in 1992 to make more space for exhibiting the collections, but the building had deteriorated over the years. The municipality decided to renovate the museum, with the work completed by the start of 2012. The cost was mostly covered by the town with some funding from the state. The renovated museum was open in March 2012, and officially opened on 23 November 2012. Today The collections are mainly focused on classical Italian painting from the 14th to 18th centuries. They include an outstanding altarpiece of the Trinity by Bartolo di Fredi, a Sienese artist of the fourteenth century. There is also a good presentation of trends in Mannerism, the school of Caravaggio and Baroque. Art from Florence predominates, including the triptych of the Passion by Domenico di Michelino and the famous Portrait of a young man by Paolo Uccello, as well as several works by Santi di Tito and Ghirlandaio. The Venetian, Neapolitan and Bolognese schools are also represented. The museum has one of the richest collections in France of Italian works from schools such as Venice, Florence, Naples and Siena, which may be explained by the history of Savoy, lying between France and Italy. There is also a good collection of classical French works and some mountain landscapes of the 19th century. There is a large open space for temporary exhibitions.

He was the head coach of Minnesota-Duluth from 1983 through to 2000. He continued coaching for several years after resigning before retiring. Career Mike Sertich began his career at Minnesota-Duluth in the mid-1960s, playing three years as a defenseman for the Bulldogs. After his playing days were over he got behind the bench at Grand Rapids High School with Gus Hendrickson, a man he would eventually replace as head coach. In 1975 both Sertich and Hendrickson would join the staff at his alma mater though Hendrickson, as head coach, saw very little success, having only one winning season in seven years. Sertich was chosen to replace Hendrickson for the 1982-83 season and brought about an immediate change. In Sertich's first season at the helm, Minnesota-Duluth posted a 28-win season, the most victories the team had accumulated in one year to that point, and amassed the best record since it had joined the WCHA in 1965. Additionally they made their first NCAA Tournament appearance. The next season saw a slight improvement when the Bulldogs won the 1984 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament before marching all the way to the 1984 National Championship game but ended up losing to Bowling Green in quadruple overtime. Sertich saw more gains the following year with a second consecutive conference title and an outstanding 36-win season (UMD's only 30-win season to date) (as of 2014). Duluth finished the 1985 NCAA Tournament in third place, losing in the semifinal to eventual champion Rensselaer though this time only in triple overtime. For his exemplary record in his first three years as head coach Sertich was named WCHA coach of the Year each season (no other coach has ever won in consecutive years) and the national coach of the year in 1984. After those early years, however, the Bulldogs fell back to the rest of the pack. After another successful season in 1985-86, Minnesota-Duluth would only have two winning seasons over the next nine years, one of which coming in 1992-93 when Sertich won both his last regular season title and coach of the year award (both from the WCHA). After a brief renaissance in the mid-1990s with three consecutive winning seasons the Bulldogs won only 7 games in 1998-99, their lowest total in 30 years, and while they improved the following season, it wasn't enough to keep Sertich around as he announced, mid-season, that the 2000 campaign would be his last. Less than a year later Sertich was suddenly back in the college ranks after taking over at Michigan Tech in the middle of the season. Sertich replaced an ineffective Tim Watters after the latter began the year 1-7-1 and sought to fix the fortunes of the once-great Huskies, salvaging the season by going 7-17-3 the rest of the way. Sertich spent two more years in Houghton calling it quits a second time and while the results weren't shown in the standings, there was a definite improvement with the character of the team. Several years later Sertich signed on as an assistant at St. Scholastica College in Minnesota, but left after only two seasons, presumably (though not definitively) for good this time.

Early life and family Ririkumutima was born in the mid-nineteenth century in the Kingdom of Burundi, the third daughter of Chief Sekawonyi of the Watussi Munyakarama clan by his wife Inankinso. One of thirteen wives of Mwezi Gisabo (ca. 1850 ‚Äì 1908), king of Burundi, Ririkumutima gave birth to three daughters and six sons. Political career The elderly king Mwezi died in 1908. Ririkumutima was anxious to secure that the royal succession would pass to one of her sons. Aware that another wife, Ntibahinya, was gaining favour and that the throne seemed likely to pass to Ntibahinya's son, Mbukije, Ririkumutima arranged for Ntibahinya's assassination. She then proclaimed throughout the kingdom that she was Mbukije's mother and therefore the rightful queen mother. While it was widely known that Ririkumutima was not Mbukije's biological mother, the fiction was accepted and she served as regent both during Mbukije's reign as Mutaga IV Mbikije and the following reign of Mwambutsa IV. The role of queen mother (mugabekazi) was a highly revered one in Burundian society; this, coupled with Ririkumutima's political acumen made her a formidable presence. Her other sons became important chiefs in the local aristocracy. =Relation to European colonial government= Though Burundi had become a German colony as part of German East Africa in 1890, the colonial power did not effectively occupy or control the region. In 1916 during World War I, the Belgian troops invaded and occupied the region. The first Europeans to encounter Ririkumutima described her as being: Death Ririkumutima died at Gitega on 28 July 1917.

The park encompasses 425 acres and the main recreation building is 302,000 sq feet. The facility is located in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, United States.  History  WisPark donated nearly $1.6 million to construct the initial phase of the then 425-acre park. On August 5, 1995, the park was officially dedicated to the people of the Village of Pleasant Prairie. Planning for RecPlex began in 1998. WisPark donated another $4 million for its construction. A ground breaking was held for LakeView RecPlex on October 12, 1999, and construction immediately followed. RecPlex officially opened its doors to the public on October 1, 2000. At the time, RecPlex offered visitors: a 17,000sq ft leisure pool, 60,000sq ft field house, 8,000sq ft fitness center, 1/6-mile suspended track, changing rooms, a child-care area and snack bar. Just over three years later, on January 12, 2004, the Village broke ground on the first addition at RecPlex. Through the first expansion, 42,000sq ft were added in the form of a new, larger fitness center, additional changing rooms, an expanded child-care area, racquetball courts, a multi-purpose studio and party rooms. A 79,000sq ft ice arena, with two NHL-sized ice rinks and many amenities, was also constructed as part of the expansion. The facility now stood at an amazing 260,000sq ft. In late 2008, a second major expansion was announced, a 50-meter Olympic-sized competition pool. Made possible through a community-focused partnership with ULINE, Inc, the Village broke ground for the pool on June 22, 2009. The 42,000sq ft expansion included a competition pool and related amenities along with seating for approximately 600 spectators. Water and air in the new pool is heated and cooled with a geothermal technology placed in the adjacent Lake Andrea. An ultraviolet technology, similar to that installed in the original aquatic center, is used to treat the water. With the latest expansion, the total size of the facility is now just over 302,000sq ft. The RecPlex Aqua Arena was dedicated to the citizens of the Village of Pleasant Prairie on June 10, 2010.

He created the 2012 iOS game Puzzlejuice while a student at USC Interactive Media & Games Division. The game began his collaboration with Greg Wohlwend. The pair's next release, the 2014 iOS puzzle game Threes, received what review aggregator Metacritic described as \\"universal acclaim\\", including perfect scores from Eurogamer and TouchArcade, and the title of Apple Inc.'s iPhone game of the year. The game was later ported to multiple platforms. Polygon included Vollmer in their \\"50 admirable gaming people\\" of the year for his work on Threes. Among other projects, Vollmer subsequently worked on Close Castles, a real-time strategy game later put on hiatus, and Royals, a simulation game for OS X and Windows.  Career  PAX 10 Vollmer is a graduate of the USC Interactive Media & Games Division program. As a student, he began work on Puzzlejuice, a puzzle video game. He reached out to artist Greg Wohlwend for aesthetic advice, which led to a collaboration between the two. Puzzlejuice is a combination of Tetris, tile-matching, and Boggle: players rearrange falling tetromino blocks into rows of similar colors, which turn into letters that are cleared from the board by forming words. The iOS game was released on January 19, 2012, to what review aggregator Metacritic described as \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. Multiple reviewers mentioned the difficulty in mentally balancing the various components of the game. Vollmer started as thatgamecompany's \\"feel engineer\\" in August 2012, but left in April 2013 to \\"go indie\\" and work on his own projects. On his blog, he said he thought the studio's current project would be groundbreaking, though he was unhappy working there. Vollmer tried to write a short story in an attempt to take a break from games. Before long, he began to play with his computer keyboard. Vollmer challenged himself to make a game that only used the arrow keys, and prototyped what would become Threes in ten hours overnight. He proceeded to iterate on the idea with Wohlwend over the game's 14-month development. In Threes, the player slides numbered tiles on a four-by-four grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Vollmer cited Drop7 as an inspiration for the game, having played it for two years beforehand. link=File:Threes video game trailer.gif Threes had no original inclination towards minimalism. In fact, Vollmer and Wohlwend felt that the game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players. They returned to the original idea and added character personalities to the tiles. The iOS game was released on February 6, 2014, to what Metacritic characterized as \\"universal acclaim\\". Reviewers found the game \\"charming\\" and \\"addictive\\", and compared it to Drop7 (2009), Triple Town (2010), and Stickets (2013). Eurogamer and TouchArcade awarded the game perfect scores, with the latter calling Threes \\"about as close as it gets to a perfect mobile game\\". Other developers released similar games and clones within weeks of the game's launch. Apple named Threes its best iPhone game of 2014. The game was later ported to Android, Xbox One, and Windows Phone platforms. Polygon included Vollmer in their \\"50 admirable gaming people of 2014\\" for his work on Threes. Vollmer thought he would work on a new game a month after releasing Threes, but was kept busy by obligations to fix and update the game, to port it to other platforms, and to promote game through press and events. He was convinced that he would never make a game \\"as clean and tight as Threes ever again\\". Vollmer's next game was Close Castles, a real-time strategy game. = After Threes = Vollmer unveiled Close Castles in June 2014. Players start in corners of a \\"grid map\\" and are represented by castles. Vollmer explained that the game's name is from castles built too close to one another, starting a mutually assured destruction scenario. Players can build three structure types out from their castle: towers that fire at incoming enemies (defense), houses that make \\"loyal subjects\\" (offense), and markets that make money (economy). The \\"A\\" button with a direction constructs a path directing followers to the enemy. Followers capture enemy structures as denoted by a \\"defense bar\\" that fills as followers enter the structure and that destroys the structure when filled. Markets are the weakest structure, and two towers can defend against one house. Player turf grows as player structures approach the limits of their area. Players earn five units of money a second, which increases by five for every market. Polygon called the game's simple visual design \\"horrifyingly deceptive\\". Vollmer has said that games should last around three minutes apiece and that the local multiplayer's lack of \\"hidden information\\" should make interactions with other players less of a \\"sadomasochistic\\" game of waiting for an opponent to concede. The game was demoed on an Xbox 360 but was planned for release on the PlayStation 4. Vollmer put the project on hold while he worked out \\"fundamental flaws\\" in the gameplay. While Vollmer traditionally worked on multiple games at once, Close Castles was his only project when it was in production. In March 2015, he worked three days a week on a bigger project with a small team, and saved his other days for personal experimentation and Threes bugs. The next month, Vollmer released Royals, a pay what you want simulation game for OS X and Windows. The player controls a peasant who advances towards royal status by collecting resources and followers. Every player decision counts as a year of the peasant's life. Polygon Megan Farokhmanesh described the game as difficult and charming, with a \\"quirky, subtle humor\\". The game was designed to be \\"purposefully difficult and obtuse\\" and \\"nothing like Threes\\". Eurogamer Jeffrey Matulef wrote that the gameplay was like a \\"comically minimalist roguelike\\" for its emphasis on resource management and short player lifespans. In February 2016, Vollmer announced Guildlings, a fantasy adventure game from a new studio he had founded with other indie developers the previous year, Sirvo Studios.http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/265943/Threes_dev_forms_new_studio_announces_first_game.php They received funding from FunPlus, who also started a $50 million investment fund for the early projects of rising video game developers and artists.http://www.polygon.com/2016/2/24/11104668/guildings-threes-interview The game released in November 2019.

She was particularly active alongside scholars in Scandinavia, where the concept of cooperative design took root and who developed strategies and techniques for workers to influence the design and use of computer applications at the workplace. Also in the area of participatory design, Greenbaum's work has been applied to studies of museums and cultural heritage institutions. Dagny Stuedahl, a professor in media design who has written about participatory design methods in museums in Norway, has been influenced by Greenbaum's focus on the organizational context for participation and involvement in processes that is central for the innovations in heritage institutions. =Education= Greenbaum has an undergraduate degree in economics from Penn State (1963) and a PhD in political economy from Union Graduate College (now the Clarkson University Capital Region Campus) (1977) with coursework at the New School for Social Research and a scholarship from the Institute for Policy Studies.

Sitting: Mallory, Wheeler, Bullock, Morshead. The 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition set off to explore how it might be possible to get to the vicinity of Mount Everest, to reconnoitre possible routes for ascending the mountain, and ‚Äì if possible ‚Äì make the first ascent of the highest mountain in the world. At that time Nepal was closed to foreigners, so any approach had to be from the north, through Tibet. A feasible route was discovered from the east up the Kharta Glacier and then crossing the Lhakpa La pass north east of Everest. It was then necessary to descend to the East Rongbuk Glacier before climbing again to Everest's North Col. However, although the North Col was reached, it was not possible to climb further before the expedition had to withdraw. Initially the expedition explored from the north and discovered the main Rongbuk Glacier, only to find that it seemed to provide no likely routes to the summit. However, at the time it was not realised that the East Rongbuk glacier actually flowed into the Rongbuk glacier ‚Äì it was thought it descended away to the east. As a reconnaissance the expedition was a success because it determined that a good route might be to approach the East Rongbuk glacier via the Rongbuk glacier, and then follow the North Col route to the summit. Next year the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition took this route and was able to climb above the North Col, although it did not reach the summit. Charles Howard-Bury led the 1921 expedition and George Mallory, who had never before been to Himalaya, was included in the team. As events were to turn out, Mallory became the de facto lead climber. Howard-Bury wrote a book about the expedition, Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance, 1921, to which Mallory contributed six of the chapters. Northeast ridge. Photograph taken by Wollaston. Background 1858 triangulation of Mount Everest In 1856 the Great Trigonometric Survey was able to calculate that the highest peak in the world was not Kangchenjunga, but the somewhat unnoticed Peak XV, measured to be 29,002 feet high.The nearest observation was from a distance of . Modern techniques would have measured the height at that time to be about 29,030 feet. Mountaineering was in its infancy but antagonism and apathy towards it were waning so, by 1907, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Alpine Club, a definite plan was hatched for a British reconnaissance of Everest. General Charles Bruce, who later on became the president of the club, was chosen to lead the expedition. Entry to Tibet, which had historically refused entry to foreigners, became possible due to Sir Francis Younghusband's imperial and exploratory activities, which culminated in his \\"Mission to Lhasa\\" and subsequent 1904 Treaty of Lhasa. Initially, the British Secretary of State for India, Lord Morley, refused permission for an expedition out of \\"consideration of high Imperial policy\\". This political delay and World War I, in John Buchan's words, \\"put an end to these pleasant fancies\\". Tibetan visa issued to the expedition By 1920 the Secretary of State had given approval for an expedition so Colonel Charles Howard-Bury was sent on a diplomatic mission which persuaded the Viceroy of India, Lord Reading, to support that idea. Because Nepal was closed to entry at the time, the expedition's planned approach march would be through Sikkim. The viceroy's agent there, Sir Charles Bell, had been working in Lhasa and he had formed a good relationship with the Dalai Lama, who granted an entry pass for the expedition.Translation at s:Tibetan passport issued to 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition. In January 1921 the Alpine Club and the Royal Geographical Society (of which Younghusband was now President) jointly set up the Mount Everest Committee to co-ordinate and fund the expedition. Although they initially supported an all-out attempt at the summit, members of the committee eventually agreed that the primary purpose of the mission should be reconnaissance. The expedition team and the march in Morshead's map showing routes taken during the expedition Bruce's military duties prevented him from participating so Howard-Bury was chosen as leader. It was a reconnaissance expedition and at the time was the closest any explorer had been to the mountain. The expedition set off in April 1921 ‚Äì the climbing team consisted of two experienced mountaineers, Harold Raeburn and Alexander Kellas, and two younger men, George Mallory and Guy Bullock, both Old Wykehamists without any Himalayan experience. The expedition team also included Sandy Wollaston, a naturalist and doctor, Alexander Heron, a geologist, Henry Morshead (also an Old Wykehamist) and Oliver Wheeler, surveyors seconded from the army. When George Bernard Shaw saw a photograph (above) of them wearing Norfolk jackets, knickerbockers, puttees and tweeds he quipped that they \\"looked like a Connemara picnic trapped in a snowstorm\\". Kampa Dzong (expedition photo) Shekar Dzong (expedition photo) The expedition, having gathered Sherpas, Bhutias, porters, supplies and 100 Army mules (which later had to be replaced with hill mules and yaks), set off from Darjeeling in British India on 18 May 1921 for the march to Everest. During their march, the climate changed from hot and humid with verdant growth and heavy, frequent rain, to cold, dry and very windy. The route took them through Sikkim ‚Äì northeast through Tista valley, over the Jelep LaLa is Tibetan for \\"pass\\" or \\"col\\". into Tibet and on into the Chumbi Valley, passing Phari at , crossing the Himalaya watershed at Tang La and continuing to the Tibetan plateau. Then, leaving the Lhasa road and taking a westward course, the expedition reached Khamba Dzong. Here, on 6 June, Kellas died suddenly of heart failure and Raeburn became sick and had to return to Sikkim. The party followed the valley of the Arun River to the west and at Shiling were first able to see Everest well enough to begin to gauge its topography. Travelling on through Shekar DzongShekar, or Shelkar.Dzong is Tibetan for \\"fort\\". they reached Tingri Dzong which became the base for the northern phase of their explorations. By that time, Mallory and Howard-Bury had taken a dislike to each other with Mallory writing that Howard-Bury was \\"too much the landlord with not only Tory prejudices, but a highly developed sense of hate and contempt for other sorts of people than his own.\\" Northern reconnaissance Topographic map, based on Wheeler's surveys From Tingri, several valleys could be followed south towards Everest and on 23 June Mallory and Bullock started off to the south with sixteen Sherpas and porters. Two days later, at Chobuk they reached the foot of the Rongbuk valley and were then able to see Everest. Ten miles further was the snout of the Rongbuk GlacierRongbuk, or Rongpu. near where they pitched base camp at , just beyond the Rongbuk Monastery (Mallory called it \\"Ch√∂yling\\"). Only familiar with Alpine glaciers, they had difficulty negotiating seracs and retired back at where the West Rongbuk Glacier debouches. Note: the glaciers have lowered and retreated considerably since that time. =Rongbuk Glacier= Everest from nine miles away in Rongbuk valley. Photograph taken by Mallory. Taking six days to acclimatise and recuperate they established Camp II at . On 1 July Mallory with five Sherpas went towards the head of the glacier near the North Face of Everest and at he was able to evaluate the western side of the North Col.The North Col was and is frequently called, Chang La, chang being Tibetan for \\"north\\". Now sometimes called Bei'ao There seemed to be no satisfactory way to reach the North Col but above there, and towards the summit, there seemed to be a feasible route. Everest's west ridge also did not seem encouraging from this location so Mallory decided the West Rongbuk glacier should be explored. =West Rongbuk Glacier= Sketch map of region north of Mount Everest The topography to the west is very complex so on 5 July Mallory and Bullock climbed the Ri Ring to get a better perspective. They were able to examine the upper North Face and the north ridge above the North Col and considered the latter was manageable. However, they formed a wrong impression that a high ridge ran from Everest's North PeakThe expedition also called North Peak Changtse ‚Äì now sometimes Bei Peak stretching away east to the Arun river. They therefore thought that any approach to the eastern side of the North Col could not be from Rongbuk, never imagining that the glacier on the other side of the North Col would turn back into the main Rongbuk glacier. In fact, where it joins, just above the Rongbuk Monastery, only a small stream is to be seen. Looking more to the west, two routes to Everest looked promising, one over the Lho La at the head of the Rongbuk glacier and one over an unnamed col between Pumori and Lingtren ‚Äì the hope was that a valley to the south of these cols might provide a good route to the summit. Mallory climbed a peak he called the \\"Island Peak\\" (Lingtrennup) from where he attempted to photograph Changtse, Everest and Lhotse, which was just visible. They eventually reached the unnamed col by going west up what is now known as the Pumori Glacier and so by 19 July were able to look down into the Western Cwm and the Khumbu Glacier. They were not able to see the South Col but they thought the Khumbu glacier looked \\"terribly steep and broken\\" and anyway the drop from their col to the glacier was a \\"hopeless precipice\\". Any approach through the Western Cwm would therefore have to be from Nepal and by a different expedition. Lingtren, Everest and Lhotse. Photograph taken by Mallory Camps were struck on 20 July with no route having been selected but there remained the possibility of reaching the North Col from the east. Before heading that way, Mallory and Bullock started to investigate the place where, unknown to them, the East Rongbuk glacier debouches. They had to curtail their exploration here because bad news came that the photographs Mallory had taken were all useless because he had been putting the photographic plates in back to front. Photographs were vital as part of the reconnaissance so for two days Mallory and Bullock raced around retaking as many as possible. On this occasion Mallory re-took his photographs from \\"Island Peak\\" and Bullock actually reached the Lho La and was able to photograph the Khumbu Icefall. On 25 July they rejoined Howard-Bury's party at Chobuk. =Morshead and Wheeler's surveys and other work= Heron's geological map of Everest region During this time Morshead and Wheeler had surveyed of difficult unknown territory producing a map of four miles to an inch (1:250,000) and updating the map of Sikkim. Wheeler made a careful photographic survey close to Everest itself producing a one-inch (1:63360) map. Wollaston had collected and identified plants, birds and animals, and Heron had made geological investigations over and had produced a geological map. Reports of these activities appeared in Howard-Bury's book along with a description of the scientific equipment and cameras that were used. Wheeler, Heron and Howard-Bury reached Nangpa La west of Everest and on the Nepalese border. Morshead and Wollaston crossed the border further west at Lapche, south of Lapche La (Labuche La), and got as far west as Nyenyam. The geographical and geological surveying reached as far north as the Tsangpo river. Howard-Bury had been exploring to the east to find a location for a future base camp. Unable to cross a tributary of the Arun, he had come to the district of KhartaKharta, or Karda. where no one knew anything about where their local river came from. Since it was glacial, Howard-Bury presumed it came from Everest and so would be a good place for an eastern base camp, if one was to be necessary. Howard-Bury then returned west for further exploration and to organise the removal of the whole expedition to Kharta on 29 July. Eastern reconnaissance =Kharta valley to Kama valley= Dzongpen of Kharta and his wife Suspecting the river at Kharta flowed from the North Col, Mallory and Bullock set off upstream on 2 August. The next day local inhabitants told them a different river flowed from Chomolungma.Tibetan name for Everest So they crossed a pass to reach the valley of the Kama River which runs parallel but to the south. They were now very close to Makalu which was further south again. Ahead of them to the west they could see Lhotse and Everest as they approached the Kangshung GlacierKangshung, or Kangxung. and the Kangshung Face. Surrounded by three of the highest peaks in the world Mallory wrote of the Kama valley, \\"For me the most magnificent and sublime mountain scenery can be made lovelier by some more tender touch; and that too is added here\\". They regarded scaling the Kangshung Face as impossible, with Mallory noting, \\"Other men, less wise, might attempt this way if they would, but, emphatically, it was not for us.\\" Kama valley. Photograph taken by Wollaston. Junipers in Kama valley. Photograph taken by Wollaston. They realised that they would have to return to the Kharta valley and to achieve this they climbed the Kartse on 7 August so they could examine the North Col as well as the Kangshung Face. They wondered if the glacier in the valley to the north was the one that came down from the North Col or whether that glacier was further north again. Everest's northeast ridge they judged very difficult. The North Col and the north ridge above it were the only possibility left. They descended Kartse to Kama and returned to the Kharta valley. =Return to Kharta valley= Mallory was taken ill and so it was left to Bullock to head on west to the head of the Kharta glacier on 13 August. However, a runner came back very soon to tell Mallory that Bullock had observed that the glacier ended in a high pass ahead. He would explore further but it was looking as if the glacier from the North Col did not flow east. Bullock returned and Howard-Bury received a letter from Wheeler showing the results of his survey ‚Äì the glacier flowing down the east side of the North Col turned sharply north and joined the main Rongbuk Glacier. Time was too short to return to Rongbuk, which now seemed clearly the best way to the North Col, so they decided the best thing to do was to prospect a route to the pass Bullock had seen, which they called Lhakpa LaLhakpa La, or Lhagba La. (\\"Windy Gap\\") to see whether the North Col could be reached in this way. The weather was bad and the glacier was treacherous but eventually they reached the Lhakpa La on 18 August. Mallory decided the route was feasible and so it was agreed the reconnaissance could be concluded. They returned to base camp for ten days' rest. North Col North Col (right) and summit (left) from Lhakpa La. Photograph taken by Howard-Bury. Diagram of expedition's routes near North Col. While Mallory and Bullock rested, advance base camp was set upThe team photograph (top) was taken by Wollaston at this location. at and camp II at on the Kharta glacier, with both camps being left unoccupied. The plan was for camp III on the Lhakpa La, IV on the North Col and one more camp before the summit although, as it turned out, this was to seriously underestimate the difficulties. They had to wait for a month for the monsoon to end and on 31 August all the team tentatively moved to advance base camp with Raeburn, who had unexpectedly returned, able to join them. They had to stay at advance base camp until 20 September for the weather to improve and then Mallory, Bullock, Morshead and Wheeler set off for and reached Lhakpa La. It was now recognised that the North Col could not be reached without an intermediate camp so they returned to camp II for further supplies so that all the team (except Raeburn) along with twenty-six Sherpas could set off again for camp III. Next morning Mallory, Bullock, Wheeler and three Sherpas went down to the East Rongbuk glacier while the rest of the party turned back. After a very difficult night on the glacier in cold and windy conditions, the following day, 24 September, saw the party reach the North Col although without carrying loads. The terrain on the Col was good for a camp but the wind was extreme and no progress would be possible. They descended to the glacier where Mallory and Bullock calculated that they would not be able to set up a camp on the North Col, nor could they survive a bivouac up there at . Also, the gales were getting worse. On 25 September the party was forced to climb again to the Lhakpa La and on 26 September the entire expedition struck all the upper camps, returned to Kharta, and eventually reached Darjeeling on 25 October without mishap. Howard-Bury was awarded the 1922 Founder's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his leadership of the expedition. Subsequent events Mount Everest panoramas, taken on the 1921 expedition Before the expedition had left Tibet, the Mount Everest Committee met and decided that a full assault should be made on the mountain in 1922 with General Bruce as leader. The Rongbuk ‚Äì East Rongbuk ‚Äì North Col route would be followed but on this occasion oxygen cylinders would be taken for the climbers. The 1921 expedition was regarded as successful by experts as well as the general public with large numbers of people turning up for the official welcome home by the Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club at the Queen's Hall in London. Howard-Bury had become a celebrity. Speaking of the future summit attempt in his Queen's Hall address Mallory said he was \\"very far from a sanguine estimate of success ... A party or two arriving the top, each so tired that it was beyond helping the other, might provide good copy for the Press but the performance would provoke the censure of reasonable opinion\\". Mallory had hoped to give up schoolteaching and to become a mountaineer and writer. When he provided his chapters for Howard-Bury's 1922 book of the expedition it had been on the clear understanding he would be paid. However, in 1923, three months before departing on the 1924 Everest expedition, he had still not received payment. When he pressed the Committee they rescinded their agreement and said he would not be paid but nevertheless they \\"fully appreciated the value of your contributions\\". The 1924 expedition was the one from which he would not return, the identity of his remains being discovered in 1999. Bullock's expedition diary was published in 1962.

Many historians acknowledge al-Irshad role in the reformation of Islamic thought in Indonesia, but unfortunately his name is not mentioned in the discourse of Islamic thought in Indonesia. Early life Ahmad Surkati was born Ahmad bin Muhammad Surkati al-Anshori in around 1875 CE in Udfu, Arqu island near Dongola town, Sudan. The word Surkati is taken from Dongolawi language meaning Many Books (Sur, books; Katti, many), because His grandfather had a lot of books when he returned from study. It is believed that he was descendant of a Sahabah named Jabir bin Abdillah al-Anshori. He came from an educated family; both his father and grandfather had studied in Egypt, with his father graduated from Al-Azhar University in Cairo. Surkati received his earliest education from his father and succeeded in memorizing text of al- Quran at young age. Ahmad attending Ma'had Syarqi Na, an institute led by a distinguished scholar in Dongola. After completing his study at the Institute, his father wanted him to pursue education at Al-Azhar in Egypt as he had done. But the intention was never fulfilled, because Sudan was then ruled by the reign of al-Mahdi which was trying to escape from Egyptian ruling. The King of Sudan at the time, Abdullah al-Taaisha, did not allow the people of Sudan to travel to Egypt. After completing his basic Islamic education in Sudan, He travelled to Mecca to carry out hajj in 1896 CE. Ahmad only briefly stayed in Mecca, then he moved onto Medina and later returned to Mecca. In Medina, He deepened his religious studies and Arabic literature for approximately four and a half years. Two of his famous teachers in Medina were two members of the original Moroccan muhaddiths, namely Sheikh Salih and Umar Hamdan. He also learned the Qur'an to Sheikh Muhammad al-Khuyari. He studied fiqh knowledge from two fiqh scholars at the time, Sheikh Ahmad Mahjub and Sheikh Mubarak an- Nismat (he mostly studied Shafi'i Madhhab), where for the Arabic studies, he learned it from a linguist named Sheikh Muhammad al-Barzan. He lived in Hejaz for fifteen years in which more than eleven years he spent it in Mecca, where he received \\"mainstream\\" education with an emphasis on Hadith, where He graduated from Darul 'Ulum in Mecca. Ahmad Surkati was the first Sudanese to earn the title of al-Allamah in 1326 AH. His outstanding skills as scholar began to be noticed in around 1909 when he was awarded a distinguished teaching post in Mecca, a position he retained before He was invited by Jamiat Kheir and moved to Batavia. Career =At Jamiat Kheir= Due to lack of qualified teachers to teach at the Jamiat Kheir school, the board decided to hire teachers from overseas. In around October 1911, Ahmad Surkati arrived in Batavia along with two other teachers, a Sudanese Muhammad bin Abdul Hamid and Muhammad al-Tayyib, a Moroccan who soon returned to his homeland. They had been preceded by another teacher, the Tunisian Muhammad bin Uthman al-Hashimi who had come to the Indies in 1910. Surkati was appointed inspector at the Jamiat Kheir schools. His first two years at this position was a great success, creating an assurance for the Jamiat Kheir to hire four more foreign teachers in October 1913. Some of more conservative Sayyid members of the Jamiat Kheir were becoming increasingly concerned about Surkati's influence on the Hadhrami community, and particular his attitudes towards the Sayyids themselves. A situation arose regarding the permissibility of non-sayyid men marrying a sayyid woman in Solo in 1913 during the school holidays when Sukarti was staying there and was consulted about the case. A non-Muslim Chinese had a concubine who was a Sayyid's daughter, ostensibly the woman was with him because of her poverty. Surkati regarded her situation as disgraceful so proposed that the Hadramis in the area donate money to her or that she be married by a non-Sayyid Muslim. His first suggestion was ignored and the second suggestion was denounced as forbidden by the Sayyid community (a non- Sayyid man did not match the Kafa'ah for a Sayyid woman). Surkati argued that the according to Islamic law, it would be permitted for the marriage of non- Sayyid man to a Sayyid woman.Mobini-Kesheh 1999, p. 55. Surkati gave his answer in more detail with arguments in column Surat al-Jawaab in newspaper \\"Suluh Hindia\\" whose editor in chief was Haji Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto. His opinion was quickly heard by the Jamiat Kheir leaders in Batavia, caused his relationship with the more conservative Sayyids deteriorated rapidly. Sukarti also experienced racist criticism against him over this conflict.Anthropologica, Part 157 2001, p. 413. The name \\"'Alawi-Irshadi conflict\\" became applied to the split between the Sayyid faction (known as 'Alawis, Alawƒ´y≈´n) and the non-Sayyids (al-IrshƒÅd led by Surkati). The 'Alawi Sayyid Muhammad bin 'AbdullƒÅh al-'A·π≠·π≠ƒÅs even said \\"The al-Irshad organization, in my view, is no pure Arab organization. There is too much African blood among its members for that\\".Mobini-Kesheh 1999, p. 91. 'AbdullƒÅh Da·∏•lƒÅn attacked Surkati's stance that all humans whether Sayyid or non-Sayyid were equal by arguing that God creating some humans like the Prophet's family (the Sayyids) as superior to others. He said, \\"will the Negro return from his error or persist in his stubbornness?\\"Mobini-Kesheh 1999, p. 96. Some Hadrami Sayyids including Da·∏•lƒÅn resorted to extreme racist results and insulted Sukarti, calling him \\"the black death\\", \\"black slave\\", \\"the black\\", \\"the Sudanese\\" and \\"the Negro\\", all while claiming that Sukarti could not speak Arabic and was a non-Arab.Mobini-Kesheh 1999, p. 98. Surkati then wrote his arguments and answers in Al-Masa \`il ats-Tsalats in 1925 which contained the issue of Ijtihad, Bid‚Äòah, Sunnah, Heresy, Ziyarat (visiting graves), Taqbil (kissing the hands of Sayyids) and Tawassul. This essay paper actually was prepared as the material for a debate with Ali al-Thayyib of the Ba'alawi. The debate itself was initially planned to be held in Bandung. But Ali al-Thayyib cancelled it and asked the debate to be held in Masjid Ampel in Surabaya. But eventually he cancelled it again so there was no debate at all. Surkati tendered his resignation from his position on September 18, 1914. =Al- Irshad= Many non-Sayyids and some Sayyids left the Jamiat Kheir with him. He initially intended to return to Mecca where he used to teach, but was persuaded to stay by a few non-Sayyid Hadhramis named Umar manq≈´sh (or Mangus with another transliteration) the Kapitein der Arabieren in Batavia, Sholih ‚ÄòUbaid and Sa‚Äôid bin Salim al-Mash‚Äôabi, so he then opened another Islamic school named Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya in Batavia on September 6, 1914, with the financial assistance of some Arabs, the largest of which of Abdullah bin Alwi Alatas as 60,000 Dutch gulden. The legal recognition by Dutch colonial government was issued on August 11, 1915. After three years of existence, the Al-Irshad Association began to open schools and branches in cities around Java. Each branch was characterized by the establishment of school (Madrasa). The first branch was in Tegal in 1917, where its Madrasa led by Ahmad Surkati's first generation student, namely Abdullah bin Salim al-Attas. This was followed by the branches in Pekalongan, Cirebon, Bumiayu, Surabaya and other cities. Al-Irshad in the early days of his birth was known as the Islamic reform group in Nusantara, along with Muhammadiyah and PERSIS (Persatuan Islam). The three main leading characters of this organizations: Ahmad Surkati, Ahmad Dahlan, and Ahmad Hassan (A. Hassan), often referred to as \\"The Trio of Indonesian Islamic Reformers.\\" All three of them were also close friends. According to A. Hassan, Ahmad Dahlan and himself were in fact disciples of Ahmad Surkati, although with unbound official timetable. Later life and death Jong Islamieten Bond (Young Muslim Union) delegates in Youth Pledge. Batavia, 1928 A. Hassan introduced Surkati to Sukarno when he was in exile in Ende, East Nusa Tenggara through Surkati's papers and books. After Sukarno was freed, he often visited Surkati. Ahmad Surkati was also the spiritual teacher of Jong Islamieten Bond (JIB), where its activists such as Muhammad Natsir, Kasman Sigodimedjo and others often learned from. Ahmad Surkati died at 10:00 am on Thursday, September 6, 1943, at his residence on Gang Solan St. (now Jl. KH. Hasyim Ash'ari no. 25) Jakarta, exactly 29 years after he founded Al-Irshad. His was buried at the Karet Bivak cemetery with modest means, with no gravestone nor sign of anything on the grave to fulfill his last wish before death.

Plot To identify which, among the various mercenary armies operating in the Orion Arm, co√∂perated with Draycos' most-recent attackers, Jack enlists in the mercenary force 'Whinyard's Edge', to investigate whether they, or any of their rivals, were participants in the ambush; but when Jack's burglary of their records is interrupted by that of fellow-recruit 'Alison Kayna', both burglars, and their four closest acquaintances among the new recruits, are betrayed by their officers to the rival organization 'Shamshir'. Having escaped, and later rescued Jack's comrades, Jack and Draycos feign destruction of the mine for which both organizations are fighting, whereupon the organizations abandon the mine to local claimants. Thereafter Jack plans to investigate the slave-trade supplying all the mercenary societies with 'Brummgas' (a troll-like species), in hope of there finding the desired information. In the epilogue, Alison Kayna investigates Jack's possessions; but the results are unseen until the sixth book of the series, Dragon and Liberator. Reception This second novel in the series received generally positive reviews. The introduction of a new lead character, Alison, a girl about Jack's age, provides scope for additional character development.
