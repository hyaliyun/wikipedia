It is native to central, southern and eastern Africa, though at the southern extreme it is replaced by the Cape honey bee (Apis mellifera capensis).Ruttner, F. 1988: Biogeography and Taxonomy of Honeybees. Springer Verlag, Berlin This subspecies has been determined to constitute one part of the ancestry of the Africanized bees (also known as \\"killer bees\\") spreading through America. The introduction of the Cape honey bee into northern South Africa poses a threat to East African lowland honey bees. If a female worker from a Cape honey bee colony enters an East African lowland honey bee nest, she is not attacked, partly due to her resemblance to the East African lowland honey bee queen. As she is capable of parthenogenetic reproduction, she may begin laying eggs which hatch as \\"clones\\" of herself, which will also lay eggs, causing the parasitic A. m. capensis workers to increase in number. The death of the host colony results from the dwindling numbers of A. m. scutellata workers that perform foraging duties (A. m. capensis workers are greatly under-represented in the foraging force), the death of the queen, and, before queen death, competition for egg laying between A. m. capensis workers and the queen. When the colony dies, the capensis females will seek out a new host colony. Moritz, R.F.A (2002) The Cape honeybee Apis mellifera capensis From laying workers to social parasites Apidologie Special Issue 33 (2), 99‚Äì244 Character A single East African lowland bee sting is no more venomous than a single European bee sting, though East African lowland honey bees respond more quickly when disturbed than do European honey bees. They send out three to four times as many workers in response to a threat. They will also pursue an intruder for a greater distance from the hive. Although people have died as a result of 100‚Äì300 stings, it has been estimated that the average lethal dose for an adult is 500‚Äì1,100 bee stings. In terms of industrial honey production, the African bee produces far less honey than its European counterpart, whilst producing more swarms and absconding (abandoning its nest). For this reason, African honey bees are less desirable than European honey bees, except where the proclivity of African bees give beekeepers no other option due to the Africans' tendency to invade and take over European nests. Appearance The appearance of the East African lowland honey bee is very similar to the European bee. However, the East African lowland honey bee is slightly smaller. The average body length of a worker is 19 mm. Its upper body is covered in fuzz, and its abdomen is striped with black. Habitat The native habitat of Apis mellifera scutellata includes the southern and eastern regions of Africa. The species was first imported across the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil before it spread to Central America, South America, and southern areas of the United States. The Africanized honey bee thrives in tropical areas and is not well adapted for cold areas that receive heavy rainfall. Foraging economics and bee habits =Nectar content and harvesting= foxtail agave Honey bees are challenged to balance energy consumption and replenishment in their pursuit of nectar. High thoracic temperatures required for foraging flight pose a thermoregulatory imbalance that honey bees attempt to alleviate by targeting particular viscosities and temperatures of nectar resources. In lower environmental temperatures where energy loss is more pronounced, it has been shown through Apis mellifera scutellata that honey bees seek warmer, less- concentrated and less-viscous nectar, an energetically favorable behavior. Nectar that is highly concentrated in sugar is more viscous and therefore reduces the speed of consumption and the size of honey bee crop loads. In cooler ambient temperatures, harvesting small, concentrated quantities of nectar does not allow honey bees to maintain the metabolism necessary for foraging flight. Harvesting warmer, less-viscous nectar is advantageous because of the energy gained by heat. Honey bees are able to stabilize their body temperature and make up for the energy lost by flying. In A. mellifera scutellata, it was found that crop loads were largely contained in the abdomen, though it remains unclear whether this balances out the aforementioned energy loss from the thorax during flight. It appears that the cost of harvesting less-viscous nectar is that it is also less concentrated in sugar and would be an energetic loss for the honey bees. However, this is not the case; the speed of harvesting nectar with less viscosity increases the quantity harvested at a given time. The relative advantage is so great that it is still more energetically favorable for a honey bee to collect warm nectar, even at low sugar concentrations (10%.) Honey bees are energetically rewarded by harvesting nectar that is warmer than ambient temperatures because they make up for energy loss during foraging and obtain more nectar more easily. The bumblebee‚Äôs ability to differentiate flower warmth by color and target warmer flowers is one noted precedent for nectar temperature selection in honey bees. =Significance of foraging= It has been noted that A. mellifera scutellata have higher rates of colony growth, reproduction, and swarming than European honey bees (A. mellifera ligustica and A. mellifera mellifera), a fitness advantage that allowed them to become an invasive species. A study by Fewell and Bertram was conducted to understand the source of these differences. The differences in fitness strategy were thought to be accounted for by the fact that African worker bees have a greater preference for pollen over nectar, which is a direct food resource for the emerging brood. Another important factor was thought to be differences between the species in age polyethism, or the allotment of different tasks as a honey bee ages. Young worker bees focus on in-hive assistance such as brood care, and the relatively younger African bee populations were thought to be one explanation for the emphasis on reproduction and colony expansion in the species. The study was also interested in the role different colony social environments and different genetic variation might play in the fitness discrepancies between the two subspecies. Behavioral differences East African lowland worker bees entering and exiting a nest in a rock crevasse The main difference found between African and European honey bees were a few behavioral traits in the worker bees that were all related to the workers‚Äô food preference. It was found that Apis mellifera scutellata workers focused on pollen processing behaviors while European workers focused on nectar processing behaviors. African bees were also more likely to store pollen while European bees stored honey. The study found that worker food preferences determined whether the colony maintained a certain reproductive rate. For example, having fewer or relatively older workers who prefer nectar means that the colony will not have the resources available to rapidly or efficiently feed new broods. Worker food preferences have been connected to genotypic variation at specific quantitative trait loci. African bees are \\"precocious foragers\\"; A. mellifera scutellata bees begin foraging for pollen significantly earlier than their European counterparts A. mellifera ligustica, and this is thought to be related to the fact that African colonies have a younger, skewed age distribution by comparison. However, this is not a direct cause for the different subsistence strategies between the two subspecies. Trade-offs of two different strategies Over time, distributions of the genotypic traits for worker food preference must have clustered around those conferring a proclivity towards resources that improved the fitness of the subspecies. The balancing of evolutionary costs and benefits have shaped the distribution of these genotypic traits. A bee population must strike a balance in the distribution of resources towards the growth of the current colony members versus reproduction. If too much energy is expended on the maintenance of an adult colony, the bees will lose the chance to expand through reproduction but they will have older workers who specialize in nectar resources for energy (honey.) If too much energy is spent on reproduction, such a colony will be less equipped to survive drastic seasonal changes because they have younger workers who specialize in pollen for feeding the brood, not energy storage. Evolution of life history strategies These two strategies have been adopted by the European and African bees, respectively. European bees must survive the winter, an annual event with predictable mortality outcomes. Trying to meet the energetic needs of the colony and reproduction might decrease their overall survival during the winter and it is more evolutionarily favorable for them to store nectar and honey. African bees are more vulnerable to less predictable times of scarcity or attack and it is therefore to their advantage to produce as many young as possible, increasing the likelihood that some or even many will survive. Such circumstances would have favored the worker bees who preferred harvesting nectar in European colonies and pollen in African colonies, providing an explanation for how a divergence in worker behavior and age distribution evolved in Apis mellifera scutellata and Apis mellifera ligustica. Fewell and Bertram‚Äôs study is significant in that it provides a plausible method through which the fitness characteristics of the subspecies could have evolved from a small number of behavioral differences in worker bees. Parasitization A strain of Apis mellifera capensis (the Cape honey bee) has monopolized social parasitism of Apis mellifera scutellata hosts in the southern region of South Africa. Specifically, a strain of A. mellifera capensis workers produce crucial pheromones, achieve reproductive status, and overthrow an A. mellifera scutellata queen. Social parasitism in the social insects can involve various forms of exploitation that disrupt the normal division of labor in the colony. The recent development of technology to study the genetic makeup of colonies has revealed that the offspring contribution of reproducing worker parasites merits closer attention. In 1990, 400 A. mellifera capensis colonies were moved into the vicinity of the A. mellifera scutellata subspecies. Ten years later, a single clonal‚Ä¶worker lineage was found to be devastating A. mellifera scutellata colonies in northern South Africa. The monopoly of this single lineage shows that they were able to subvert queen regulation of reproduction and worker recognition mechanisms. Dietemann et al. was able to prove that A. mellifera capensis worker parasites were able to produce mandibular pheromones that mimic that of A. mellifera scutellata queens while in their presence. The resulting breakdown of the division of labor leads to desertion or death of the parasitized colony. =Method and results= Although many pheromones contribute to reproduction, pheromones made in the mandibular gland of queens have been closely linked to reproduction, and they are produced by workers that reproduce. The pheromones prevent others from attacking them, induce workers to recognize them as queen, and give them access to higher quality foods. They also stop other workers from turning reproductive. A. mellifera capensis worker parasites create female clones and usurp the A. mellifera scutellata queen. The worker parasites and their increasing number of clones become the sole reproductive individuals in the colony. The destruction of the division of labor leads to reduced resources that eventually force the colony to leave or perish. =Evolution of pheromone production= The single lineage of parasitizing A. mellifera capensis may have gained evolutionary advantage because, compared to other related species, it is not susceptible to the host queen‚Äôs pheromonal reproductive suppression of workers. The non-invasive varieties of A. mellifera capensis produce less mandibular secretions than the invasive strain. In addition, they produce secretions that are not as similar to that of A. mellifera scutellata queens as that of the invasive strain. The single lineage was selected for its greater resistance to and greater ability to mimic and overwhelm the pheromonal regulation by host queens. Pheromonal differences It was discovered that A. mellifera scutellata queens produce more pheromones than A. mellifera capensis queens, suggesting that quality or content of pheromones rather than quantity may explain how A. mellifera capensis workers are able to disregard host queen signals. Pheromonal differences between the subspecies is a subject that requires more in-depth investigation to understand how such parasitization is made possible. As mandibular pheromones were a focus of the Dietemann et al. study it is probable that different glands contribute to the pheromones related to reproductive status. =Evolutionary advantages and disadvantages= The multifaceted aspect of communication in social insects makes social insect colonies easy to hijack. Especially in the case of closely related species and subspecies, the biology and organization of potential host species are similar to that of potential parasitizing species, making them easier to infiltrate. On the other hand, potential parasites face the challenge of being discovered by the host queen, usually the sole reproductive individual in the colony. The existence of A. mellifera capensis worker parasites is an example of an alternative evolutionary strategy that allows them to increase their ‚Äúdirect fitness in foreign colonies rather than inclusive fitness in their natal nests.\\" Workers usually focus their efforts on raising and caring for larvae that are related to them, thus preserving the propagation of their genes and contributing to their inclusive fitness. The parasitic model is more advantageous by comparison because it allows workers to directly reproduce offspring that are more closely related to them and greater in number, so they are a component of direct fitness. The invasive lineage of A. mellifera capensis succeeded either because of an inability to recognize the host A. mellifera scutellata queen signal correctly or a resistance to the signal. Ultimately this is an interesting example of a preexisting weakness towards social parasitism by A. mellifera capensis in A. mellifera scutellata. Organisms evolve reproductive strategies that ensure the survival and propagation of the organisms‚Äô genes. Successful reproductive strategies cope with particular economic constraints experienced by the organism. The parasitic relationship between A. mellifera scutellata and A. mellifera capensis is an example of how a normally successful strategy of chemical recognition and maintenance of a reproductive division of labor can be undermined by competing, exploitative strategies. Evolution The underlying hypothesis for the aggressive behavior of East African lowland honey bees is based on the idea that this race of bees evolved in an arid environment, where the bees' food was scarce. Under this situation, selection favored more aggressive colonies, which protected their food source and hive from predators and robbed bees from other colonies. This behavior allowed more aggressive colonies to survive where the less aggressive colonies eventually were selected against by natural selection.

History Kite was laid down as YMS-374 on 31 January 1943 by the Weaver Shipyards in Orange, Texas, and launched 17 February 1944. She was completed and commissioned on 31 May 1944 with Lt. (j.g.) Robert A. Harris in command. After shakedown out of Little Creek, Virginia, and minesweeping operations in Massachusetts Bay, YMS-374 cleared Boston, Massachusetts, 30 September and steamed toward the Pacific war zone. The minesweeper arrived Pearl Harbor 18 November and following formation sweeping maneuvers, sailed 22 January 1945 escorting LST Flotilla 21 to Saipan. YMS-374 participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima, arriving off the island 17 February. She cleared lanes for landings scheduled 2 days later. Following the invasion, YMS-374 made antisubmarine patrols, escorted support ships, and laid smoke screens before retiring to the Philippines and arriving Leyte 8 March. The minesweeper steamed into Saipan 28 March and for nearly 5 months she operated in the Marianas on ASW patrols, convoy escort, submarine training exercises, and plane guard duty for crews of downed B-29 bombers. After the fighting stopped YMS-374 sailed for Kakyoto Island on the southwestern coast of Korea to clear approaches to Jinsen for the landing of occupation troops. She swept Korean waters until she sailed 7 September for minesweeping operations in the Nagasaki ‚Äì Sasebo area. YMS-374 departed Japan 29 December and arrived on the U.S. West Coast in January 1946. After a year of operations out of California she was renamed USS Kite (AMS-22) on 18 February 1947. She decommissioned that same day and was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Kite recommissioned 9 May 1949, Lt. (j.g.) Nicholas Grkovic in command. After repairs in San Diego and Long Beach, California, she sailed for Pearl Harbor 25 July and cleared Hawaii 26 September for operations in the Western Pacific out of Japan. Soon after the outbreak of the Korean War, Kite sailed 13 July 1950 for Pusan. Operating in that area through most of the summer, Kite sailed 12 September to clear waters approaching Inchon. The amphibious assault which followed there was among the most successful operations of the war and began a major Allied land offensive. During October, as the drive into North Korea gathered momentum, the minesweeper arrived at Wonsan to open the mined harbor to Allied supply ships and then retired to Yokosuka, Japan, for repairs. Kite returned to the conflict zone 5 January 1951, and for the rest of the conflict she continued mine clearing operations along the Korean coast. Her services allowed Allied supply and fire support ships to complete their missions through heavily mined waters. After the Korean Armistice Agreement 27 July 1953, Kite remained in the Far East continuing minesweeping operations out of Korea and Japan. Kite was reclassified MSC(O)-22 on 7 February 1955. On 6 January 1956 she was decommissioned at Chinhae, South Korea, and transferred to the Republic of Korea Navy as Kim Po (MSC-520). Her ultimate fate is unknown.  Awards and honors Kite received 2 battle stars for World War II service, and 10 for Korean War service.  Notable crew members  Lt. (j.g.)

Mokare had two known brothers: Mollian (d. 1829), who may have been known as Yallapoli, and Nakina, who with Mokare, was a frequent visitor to the Albany settlement, staying with the government resident, Alexander Collie. He also was recorded as having a married sister. Possibly first recorded as the charismatic \\"Jack\\" recorded by Phillip Parker King in his expedition to King George Sound in 1821, Mokare was from the Minang clan of Noongar. With the arrival of Major Edmund Lockyer in the brig Amity, in 1827, he showed the Europeans the walking trails that the Noongar people had used and maintained over generations in the Albany region. Many of these are today the roads of that region of Australia. He became a close friend of the surgeon-assistant J. S. Nind, with whom he frequently visited. In December 1829 Mokare guided Thomas Braidwood Wilson's overland expedition during which Mount Barker and Mount Lindsay were named, as well as Hay River, Denmark River and Wilson Inlet. Two months later he served again as the guide for Captain Barker's expedition over the same area. As there was no competition between Europeans and Aboriginal people for land, women or hunting, the settlement in Albany was particularly peaceful. Mokare was well known in his short life for being a peacemaker, and an effective mediator between black and white communities. He was concerned when Stirling took command of the Albany settlement in 1830, as he had heard of the battles and massacres between European settlers and Aboriginal people, and wished Albany to be maintained as a separate settlement. Mokare died on 26 June 1831. The Noongar people and Europeans had assembled at Collie's house and walked to a site selected by Nakina where the Europeans dug a grave and Mokare was interred with a buka cloak and personal artefacts to Nakina's specifications.Dale, R. 1834 Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &c.; of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country p. 9 When Collie himself was dying from tuberculosis in 1835, he asked to be buried alongside Mokare. Their graves are together beneath Albany Town Hall. Four years after Mokare's death, the surveyor John Septimus Roe had his body exhumed and re-interred at the newly established Albany Cemetery. A park consisting of native bushland on the northern side of Mount Melville in Albany was named after Mokare in 1978. A statue was erected in Alison Hartman Gardens on York Street in the centre of Albany in 1997 as part of a reconciliation project.

He found it hard to find work in Portland, but through the connections of his father, he started working for the Japanese government at its consulate in Chicago, Illinois. He was employed as one of several Consular attach√©s at that office, mainly doing clerical work. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the United States into World War II against Japan and Germany, Yasui resigned his position with the consulate on December 8, 1941. World War II Yasui returned to Hood River from Chicago after his father, Masuo Yasui, requested that he come home in order to report for military duty. After returning to Hood River, he tried to report for duty with the United States Army at the Vancouver Barracks in neighboring Washington, but was denied from serving on nine occasions. Masuo Yasui was arrested on December 13, 1941, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as an enemy alien, and had his assets frozen. Min Yasui moved to Portland and opened a private law practice in order to help the Japanese Americans put their affairs in order. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, that allowed the military to set up exclusion zones, curfews, and ultimately the internment of Japanese Americans during the war. Poster of exclusion orders On March 28, 1942, Yasui deliberately broke the military implemented curfew in Portland, by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm in order to test the curfew‚Äôs constitutionality.Irons, Peter H. 1983. Justice At War. New York: Oxford University Press. He first asked an officer on the street to arrest him but was told to \\"Run along home, sonny boy,\\" and so he walked into the police station. Later, on bail, he learned that a grand jury had indicted him. After the notice was given for the Japanese to evacuate, Yasui notified the authorities that he had no intentions of complying, and went to his family's home in Hood River. This violated another law restricting travel of Japanese Americans, and authorities arrested him in Hood River. Yasui had consulted a friend in the FBI prior to arrest, and consulted with other legal minds to try to test the legality of the orders. At trial he was defended by private attorney Earl Bernard. Gus J. Solomon, later a judge for the same court, had asked the national American Civil Liberties Union to defend Yasui as no local Oregon groups elected to support Yasui. One part of the strategy was to proceed with a non-jury trial, leaving the decision only to the judge. Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues, along with eight other attorneys. At his trial, federal judge James Alger Fee came to the conclusion that laws specifically targeting a race, such as the curfew, were unconstitutional when applied to citizens. However, he also declared in his November 16, 1942, decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen. Yasui was sentenced to one year in prison and given a $5000 fine. Yasui waited nine months for his chance in court for appeal. During this time he was incarcerated at the Multnomah County Jail in Portland, and later sent to the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho. When that chance finally came, the case went first to the Ninth Circuit briefly, but was then moved on to the Supreme Court. There the judges came to the conclusion that Yasui was still a U.S. citizen. After a few days on June 21, 1943, however, in Yasui v. United States, the court ruled unanimously that the government did have the authority to restrict the lives of civilian citizens during wartime, deciding the case as a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States. Yasui was sent back to Fee, who removed the fine and decided that the time already served was enough of a punishment. Yasui was released and moved into the Japanese internment camps. Later years In 1944, Yasui was allowed to leave the internment camp in the summer and was employed in Chicago before moving to Denver, Colorado, in September 1944. There he passed the bar in June 1945, but was only admitted to practice law after an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court. The following year in November he married former internee True Shibata, and they would have three daughters together, Iris, Holly, and Laurel. Living in Denver, Yasui became involved with community relations, serving on committee set up by the mayor, and later from 1959 to 1983 on the Commission on Community Relations. This commission dealt with race relations and other social issues, with Yasui as executive director from 1967 to 1983. In 1954, he was chairman of the Japanese American Citizens League‚Äôs (JACL) district covering Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Montana. The Minoru Yasui Community Service Award was started in 1974 by Denver community leaders, and is awarded annually to Denver area volunteers. In 1976, Yasui began working on the JACL‚Äôs committee concerning redress for the internment during World War II. He continued on that committee until 1984, serving as its chairman in 1981. He also filed in federal district court in Oregon a coram nobis to attempt to overturn his conviction in 1984. His conviction was overturned by the Oregon federal court in 1986. Minoru Yasui died on November 12, 1986, and is buried in his hometown of Hood River. Legacy The City and County of Denver owns an office building named after Yasui. Located at 303 West Colfax Avenue in Denver, the building is called Minoru Yasui Plaza, or the Minoru Yasui Building. A bronze bust of Yasui adorns the building's foyer.

He promoted the drawing of environmental forms in a verisimilitudinous style and was known for his early modern work in portraiture. Aina is the great-grandfather of Canadian pop singer Joseph Onabolu. Early life and education Aina Onabolu was born in Ijebu-Ode in 1882. His father was a successful merchant and his mother was also a trader. He started painting at the early age of 12, inspired by the cheap re-produced illustrations of Western arts which were prominent in many Nigerian magazines and religious books. By the age of 32, he was able to exhibit his own works and was quite popular as a knowledgeable and skilled artist. He later traveled abroad to study art at Acad√©mie Julian in Paris and at a school in London; before his sojourn abroad, he was already a competent and self-taught draftsman. He completed his studies with a diploma in fine arts and a teacher's certificate from St. John Woods College, London in 1922. ''' Career In 1909, when the colonial government in Nigeria took control of formal education, the curriculum in the schools was geared towards the provision of suitable education to train clerk position clerks for the colonial Administration government administration. Little was thought of arts education in secondary education until a report recommended the teaching of native indigenous handcraft. Prior to the report, Onabolu had formally presented requests for the introduction of modern arts education in secondary schools but his option was rejected by the colonial education officers. During the time, there were implicit suggestions by the colonial officers that the natural limits of Africans was in pottery and craft. Onabolu's return from St John Woods, London, in 1922 and Julians academy in Paris and his acquired knowledge of the European technique of painting, anatomy and the characteristics of European art education coincided with a new perspective on introducing indigenous art education in the country. Onabolu, who had taught informally to enthusiastic students began teaching in a few top schools in Lagos such as King's College, Lagos and CMS Grammar School, Lagos. His themes dealt primarily with the science of perspective, drawing, human proportions, and watercolor painting. Though there were few teachers on western techniques in art, Onabolu's period started the separation of art and life. Onabolu also encouraged the adoption of European teachers in art instruction in the country. His effort led to the hiring of a foreign art teacher named Kenneth C. Murray. Murray led a gradual re-awakening of traditional handicraft and arts. The new approach of promoting indigenous African arts and staying within the native repository of knowledge in traditional African arts was introduced into the curriculum of various secondary schools in the country. The efforts of the new instructor yielded early dividends, as the number of Nigerian art instructors increased and knowledge of traditional works such as the Uli body and wall became more pronounced. However, Murray's effort meant little in the long run as the country was in the midst of a colonial and Western government which introduced its own way or life, leading to a gradual shift in the society from traditional to a Western culture. Works Onabolu's major artworks were portraits. His portrait of Mrs Spencer Savage in 1906 is sometimes credited as one of the earliest outstanding work of art that used a western and modern style and technique. Another major work of his was the portrait of Mr Randle. The latter was his mentor who got his attention on the deleterious characteristics of colonialism which was accentuated with a segregationist governor in the person of Walter Egerton. He also made a portrait of Chief (Dr.) Sapara, which was in watercolor Several of his portraits are held in the National Gallery of Modern Art, Lagos. The major figures in his work were Lagos elites who were successful professionals in their field of work, and his work usually depicted a countenance of respect, achievement and status of his clients. However, his work was not limited to portraiture. In the 1930s, he worked with the Church of Christ in designing the pews of a new cathedral to be built in Lagos. He later produced pastel compositions and studies in the 1940s.

Running from downtown Durham, the route leaves the city to the east, running into a rural area near Falls Lake. As the road approaches Wake Forest, it widens to a four-lane divided highway and runs along the southern side of the city. Once leaving Wake Forest NC 98 becomes a two lane road again, running through rural areas east of Bunn. After a short concurrency with NC 39, NC 98 continues southeast to reach its eastern terminus at US 64 Alternate and NC 231 west of Spring Hope. NC 98 first appeared in 1930 as a state route connecting NC 91 and NC 102 in the coastal region of North Carolina. That routing was abolished in 1931 in favor of an extended NC 58\\\\. The current routing of NC 98 was established in 1934 with the road's western terminus at NC 91 (present-day Jones Dairy Road) to US 64 west of Spring Hope. In 1941, NC 98 was moved to a new section of road running from Zebulon Road to US 1 in Youngsville, which would later become part of NC 96\\\\. In 1952, NC 98 was again relocated along NC 264 through Wake Forest to Durham, and NC 96 took over its abandoned section. In 2003, a bypass was completed around Wake Forest leading to the rerouting of mainline NC 98 to the bypass and the establishment of a business route through the town center. Route description NC 98 begins at US 15 Business/US 501 Business in downtown Durham. The eastbound lanes of the road begin at Roxboro Street, however the westbound lanes continue to Magnum Street along a one-way road. From its terminus, the road heads east along Holloway Street, following a concurrency with US 70 Business Holloway Street continues to the US 70 interchange, where the US 70 Business concurrency ends. NC 98 continues running along Holloway Street, until intersecting Clayton Road, where it then become Wake Forest Highway. Wake Forest Highway continues to be the name for NC 98 throughout Durham County. The highway passes by Oak Grove Elementary School and Neal Middle School on the outskirts of Durham. Before leaving Durham County, the road passes over an extension of Falls Lake. As the highway enters Wake County, the name changes to Durham Road, which stays the name of the road until Wake Forest. After an intersection with Old Creedmoor Road, NC 98 and NC 50 have a cloverleaf interchange. Continuing to the east, the road intersects Six Forks and New Light Roads, before once again crossing over Falls Lake. After passing by several neighborhoods and crossing over Falls Lake two more times, the road intersects Thompson Mill Road, where it widens from a two lane road to a four lane divided highway. After about , the road intersects both Falls of the Neuse Road and NC 98 Business The name Durham Road changes to follow NC 98 Business and NC 98 continues to become the Dr. Calvin Jones Highway. After passing by the Wakefield neighborhood, the road has a single-point urban interchange with US 1 (Capital Boulevard). Continuing straight it goes on to intersects Galaxy Drive, US 1A (South Main Street), Franklin Street, and Heritage Lake Road, before meeting back up with NC 98 Business at the Wait Avenue/Jones Dairy Road intersection. After the intersection, NC 98 changes back into a two lane road, carrying the Wait Avenue name. The highway passes through a very rural area east of Wake Forest, with a few neighborhoods present. Wait Avenue intersects Averette Road at a stoplight, and then continues on to intersect NC 96 just north of Rolesville. Continuing with the same Wait Avenue name into Franklin County, the highway intersects US 401 at an intersection with slip ramps. From there the road continues to go through a rural area east of Bunn with very few neighborhoods nearby. As the road enters into the downtown areas of Bunn, its name changes to Jewett Avenue. The road travels through a mainly residential area of the town before intersects NC 39 in the center of town. NC 98 turns right onto South Main Street to begin a concurrency with NC 39, which it follows for a little over . South Main Street runs through the main commercial center of the town, and passes by Bunn High School before NC 39 turns off to the south. NC 98 continues southeast along its own highway, toward Spring Hope running through very rural areas of Nash County. As the highway reaches its terminus, a few houses appear along the southern side of the road. NC 98 has its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 64 Alternate, which continues east to Spring Hope and south to the US 64 freeway. This spot also marks the northern terminus of NC 231. History NC 98 was established in 1934 as a renumbering of a section of NC 581; from NC 91 (Jones Dairy Road) in Wake Forest to US 64 west of Spring Hope. In 1940, it was truncated to a relocated NC 91 (Zebulon Road), with its routing west into Wake Forest becoming part of NC 91. In 1941, NC 98 was extended north as a new primary routing to US 1 in Youngsville. In 1952, NC 98 was rerouted west through Wake Forest ending in Durham, replacing NC 264; its former alignment became part of NC 96. In 1975, NC 98 was rerouted in Durham: replacing the old alignment to US 15 Business/US 501 Business via Miami Boulevard and Geer Street, to Holloway Street (westbound)/Chapel Hill Street-Liberty Street (eastbound) and its current western terminus. In 1978, NC 98 replaced part of US 64's routing to its current eastern terminus. In 1981, part of NC 98 was abandoned and placed on new construction as a result of the creation of Falls Lake; remnants of the old alignment that were not submerged became secondary roads. In 2006, NC 98 was rerouted south along US 1 and onto a new four-lane bypass south of Wake Forest to Jones Dairy Road; its old alignment becoming NC 98 Business. In 2011, NC 98 was removed from US 1 and placed onto new construction east of Falls of Neuse Road; NC 98 Business was also realigned, starting further east along a new alignment of Durham Road. The first NC 98 was established in 1930 as a new primary routing from NC 91 near Wilson, to NC 102 near Snow Hill. In 1931, it was decommissioned in favor of becoming part of NC 58. =North Carolina Highway 264= North Carolina Highway 264 (NC 264) was formed in 1941 as a renumbering of NC 91\\\\. It went from the intersection at Roxboro and Greer streets in Durham to US 64/US 264 in Zebulon. It was renumbered in 1952. The route from current NC 98 to Zebulon was renumbered as NC 96\\\\. The rest of the route was renumbered as NC 98. Future As of March 2017, NCDOT is conducting a study about the future of a stretch of the highway from US 70 in Durham to US 401 north of Rolesville. A public study is open until April 2017 but the study will not conclude until July 2018. At that point, the study group will recommend improvements to NC 98. Major intersections Special routes =Wake Forest business loop= North Carolina Highway 98 Business (NC 98 Bus.) begins at the NC 98/Falls of the Neuse Road intersection just north of Wakefield. The road runs northeast along the western edge of the Crenshaw Hall Plantation neighborhood. After about the road turns a more eastern direction following the old routing of NC 98 (Durham Road). The road has an interchange with US 1 (Capital Boulevard) in the western sections of Wake Forest. NC 98 Business continues to the east toward downtown Wake Forest. Once reaching downtown the road runs along the southern side of the Southeastern Baptist Seminary before having a roundabout intersection with US 1A. US 1A joins NC 98 Business and continues along the eastern side of the seminary. NC 98 Business turns right onto Roosevelt Avenue and enters downtown Wake Forest. The road merges into Wait Avenue and continues east out of downtown Wake Forest. Just before the road ends at NC 98 the road makes a 90 degree right turn before ending at the NC 98/Jones Dairy Road/NC 98 Business intersections. The road name Wait Avenue continues along NC 98 east. NC 98 Business was first created running along Wait Avenue through Downtown and met NC 98 at the US 1A roundabout. This was a renumbering of NC 98 as the first sections of the Wake Forest bypass were put into place. As NC 98 was expanded to US 1, NC 98 Business expanded to cover all of the previous NC 98 routing east of US 1 and west of Jones Dairy Road. In September 2010 the third segment of NC 98 was opened from US 1 to Thompson Mill Road with the old routing between Thompson Mill Road and Fawn Drive being torn up and replaced with new routing which became NC 98 Business.

He was replaced by Kenneth M. Reels. Before becoming the tribal chairman, he worked as a pipefitter at General Dynamics Electric Boat and lived in Stonington, Connecticut. In 1994, the University of Connecticut awarded him an honorary degree.  Early life and education  Hayward was born on November 28, 1947 in New London, Connecticut, one of 10 children. He married Aline Aurore Champoux and held a variety of jobs before running a clam shack called the Sea Mist Haven near the Mystic Seaport. Pequot Indian reservation Hayward's grandmother Elizabeth George died in May 1973. She was the last member of the Pequot Indian tribe, and she still lived on the 214 acre Pequot Indian reservation. She was the only person living on the reservation, so the land passed back to the State of Connecticut when she died. Hayward's family, however, thought that the land should belong to them, not to an Indian tribe, so they attempted to lay claim to it.Fromson, Brett Duval. Hitting the Jackpot: The inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History. New York: Atlantic Monthly, 2003. Print. pp. 25-26. In 1975, Hayward met with Thomas Tureen, the head of the Coalition of Eastern Native Americans (CENA), who helped him initiate a land claim on his family's behalf. Tureen and Hayward also discussed obtaining federal recognition from the federal government for his group. Connecticut Governor Ella Grasso gave state recognition in 1976 to Hayward's group as an Indian organization, which called itself the Western Pequots. In 1979, Hayward and the Western Pequots were given a $12,000 grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to create an economic development plan for the reservation. The group then received a $1.2 million loan from HUD in 1979 for the construction of 15 houses. Hayward appointed his cousin John Holder as executive director of the housing project. In 1982, Hayward and his associates devised a way to bypass the official process of acquiring Federal recognition of an Indian tribe, which legally required the involvement of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Their approach allowed the Western Pequot group to avoid the BIA altogether, because they did not have any sort of historical records or any way to demonstrate the \\"blood quantum\\" requirements which proved that they were an actual, historical Indian tribe. They were represented at the Congressional hearing concerning their proposed settlement bill by Tureen and a lawyer named Jackson King. King worked out a deal with Tureen that, in the proposed settlement bill, they would also ask the Federal government to give them enough money to buy out the landowners whom King was representing. That bill was approved by the Senate in February 1983. President Reagan vetoed the bill, however, stating that it would set a dangerous precedent for creating other new tribes, but Senator Lowell Weicker began to lobby against the President. He raised Congressional supporters who threatened to override the veto, so President Reagan compromised; and thus the Western Pequots were given Federal recognition, calling themselves the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe of Connecticut.United States. Cong. Senate. Committee on Indian Affairs. Mashantucket Pequot Indian Land Claims. 98 Cong., 1 sess. S 1499. Washington, D.C.: United States Government Printing Office, 1983. Print. Casino gambling Hayward and Tureen immediately started planning a high-stakes bingo operation. Neither of them had any experience in running a business, so Hayward sought out Howard Wilson, a member of the Penobscot tribe and a veteran bingo operator. The bingo hall opened on July 5, 1986 and was generating as much as $30 million a year in revenues by 1988. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) was passed in 1988, and Hayward and Tureen saw that a casino situated on an Indian reservation would be a highly profitable enterprise. They found overseas financial backers, and Foxwoods Casino began its business in 1992. By 1998, the casino was generating more than a billion dollars in revenue and Hayward was a multimillionaire. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe grew from one person (while Hayward's grandmother Elizabeth George was alive) to 125 members when Hayward organized the Western Pequots, to more than 300 today. In 1998, Hayward lost the election for tribal chairman to Kenny Reels. Hayward had been chairman of the tribe since the creation of Western Pequot Indians of Connecticut, Inc. He ran for the position of tribal chairman again in 2002 but lost to Michael J. Thomas. After this, he divorced himself from tribal matters, since it was about profit and business.

Since 1927, its traditional main location has been in the former Werden Abbey in Essen in the Ruhr Area, with additional facilities in Duisburg, Bochum, and Dortmund, and, since 2010, at the Zeche Zollverein, a World Heritage Site also in Essen.Deutschlandradio New Name and Building, 10 January 2010 (in German) The Folkwang University is home to the international dance company Folkwang Tanz Studio (FTS). Founded as , its name was Folkwang Hochschule (Folkwang Academy) from 1963 until 2009. Main building of the Folkwang University in Essen-Werden History Folkwang-Hochschule The university shares its unusual name with the Museum Folkwang founded in 1902 by arts patron Karl Ernst Osthaus. The term Folkwang derives from F√≥lkvangr, the Old Norse name of a mythical meadow where the dead gather who are chosen by Freyja, the Norse goddess of love and beauty, to spend the afterlife with her. The school's founders, opera director , stage designer Hein Heckroth and choreographer Kurt Jooss, regarded this Folkwang as a symbol for the arts as a unified whole, rather than divided into separate classes. The Folkwangschule f√ºr Musik, Tanz und Sprechen (Folkwang School for Music, Dance, and Speech) opened in 1927 in Essen, and in 1928 a previously established school of design merged with the institution. In 1963 the Folkwang school was renamed Folkwang- Hochschule (Folkwang Academy). In 2010 the institution began offering graduate studies and was renamed Folkwang University of the Arts.

Notably, these records often exclude direct cash payments made by popes themselves or mediated through the Curia's Bank of the Holy Spirit. Because of the thoroughness of the records down to the minutest details, they have been used by historians to establish the daily living conditions in the papal household and the administration of the Papal States.British Records Association.

Materials used depend on where the people live in Australia. Bark thumbright250px Baskets are often made from twisted bark fibresBark is used by many people across the continent. This technology is still used today to produce baskets, which are particularly popular in the tourism industry. Kurrajong bark is a popular bark, as is the bark of river wattles, Sandpaper figs, banyans, burney vines and peanut trees. In the north, the more tightly woven styles are made, whereas in the south, a looser stringed bag, popularly known as a dilly bag are made. Hair Hairstring is an important textile traditionally made by Aboriginal Australians. People, particularly women, would cut their hair regularly using quartz or flint knives. This hair is never wasted. It can be spun into long threads of yarn on a spindle rolled on the thigh and then plaited to about the thickness of 8 ply wool. Purposes for the string are manifold. These include making the head ring for resting the coolamon, headbands to keep the hair off the face, spear-making (securing the head to the shaft), and even balls for ball games. A general-purpose belt is made of the string, from which things could be hung, such as small game like goannas in order to free the hands on long walks and hunts. Aboriginal dancers wearing a more modern version of this covering, performing at Nambassa in New Zealand- 1981 Among some groups, including the Pitjantjajara, a small modesty apron was made of the string for young girls to wear when they reached puberty. People in Central Australia today may talk of a girl having her \\"string broken\\",ABC Radio National Interview with anthropologist Diane Bell which can mean sexual abuse, or having sex when she is not ready. Among some tribes, adults wore a loincloth- like pubic covering, which also hung from the waist belt. This was made either of the string itself, or of other material, including paperbark. In the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the men wore pearl shells as a pubic covering, which they call Riji,Aboriginal Lonka Lonka Pearl Shell Pendant, Pubic Covers From Kimberly (Tribalmania.Com) and which are considered extremely sacred. The string could be dyed various shades using dyes such as ochre. Some string was only worn for ceremony, such as skirts worn by the women. String games Cat's cradle Many Aboriginal groups traditionally made many shapes out of the string (cat's cradle). A researcher once watched and photographed a young Aboriginal woman from Yirrkala make over 200 separate string figures. Each one involved complicated movements of her fingers and thumbs. She was able to remember the correct sequence of finger movements for nearly every figure she made, with only an occasional mistake which she quickly corrected. As she made each figure she gave it a name. Some examples included dangurang ‚Äî a lobster, bapa ‚Äî lightning, matjur ‚Äî an ibis flying into a tree and gapu ‚Äî the ripples on a pool.Aboriginal Technology: Fibrecraft, Barlow, Alex, 1994, Macmillan Education Pty Ltd, p 6.

Materials used differ depending on the area in Australia. In the arid areas, spinifex is common, whereas in the Top End, palms such as pandanus are often used. Pandanus and sand-palm are used in areas such as the Daly River region and Arnhem Land to weave carry baskets, dilly string bags, wall hangings, fibre sculpture, floor mats and fish nets. The women of Peppimenarti and Gunbalanya are famous for such weaving: each community has their own distinct styles and techniques.

He began his career in the studio of Russell Roberts in Sydney, moving on to work with Max Dupain soon after. Despite being offered a junior partnership with Dupain, Moore moved to London in 1951, where commissioned work appeared in The New York Times, Time, The Observer and other publications. A series documenting life in the poor working class and unemployed suburb of Redfern was included in Edward Steichen's major 1955 exhibition The Family of Man which originated at the Museum of Modern Art and toured the world. He returned to Australia in 1958, contributing picture stories to magazines including Walkabout but continued to publish in American and British magazines, joining the New York-based Black Star photo agency. In the 1970s Moore developed non-commissioned works aimed at capturing what he called \\"the soft flow of time\\", as opposed to the \\"decisive moment\\" favoured by magazine editors.

Overview The effect, though often associated with chorus, is in fact created through a staggered series of phasing filters, unlike the usually aligned filters of a normal phasing effect.

A 1958 re-recording was released on Milestones. \\"Love for Sale\\", previously released on a 1974 Japanese compilation, features the same lineup that would play on most of Kind of Blue. \\"Blues No. 2\\" comes from the last session that Davis and John Coltrane would record together in 1961, although Coltrane does not play on the track. The title track, \\"Circle in the Round,\\" is the first studio recording in which he departed from the acoustic quintet, and therefore marks the inception of his \\"electric\\" period. Recorded in 1967, it was the earliest released recording of Miles that featured the sound of the electric guitar (played by Joe Beck), something that would become prominent in his music over the years. Edited here by seven minutes, the full track was released on The Complete Studio Recordings of The Miles Davis Quintet 1965‚Äì1968.

Subcortical ischemic depression refers to vascular depression specifically due to lesions and restricted blood flow, known as ischemia, in certain parts of the brain. However, the disorder is typically described as vascular depression in the literature. There is no formal and accepted definition of vascular depression and the hypothesis requires further research to support the causal link between these vascular lesions and depression. Thus, it is difficult to determine if vascular depression can be considered a distinct sub-type of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, with current criteria, some studies estimate that vascular depression may account for over half of the cases of MDD in the elderly. Diagnosis Vascular depression is typically diagnosed using either Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or clinically defined criteria. MRI-defined vascular depression is more commonly referred to as subcortical ischemic depression (SID) and emphasizes the relationship between MRI identification of lesions in the brain and depressive symptoms. An alternative definition is depression executive dysfunction (DED) syndrome and focuses on the link between clinical symptoms of cardiovascular risk and depressive symptoms. Both of these competing definitions are supported in the literature and provide a strategy to diagnose vascular depression. The criteria for MRI-defined vascular depression focuses on the presence and severity of either deep white matter lesions, often referred to as white matter hyperintensities, or subcortical grey matter lesions. The most severe lesion in an individual is scored based on predefined criteria and considered in combination with two measures of depressive symptomology. These white matter lesions are thought to disrupt emotional and cognitive functioning. Alternatively, clinically defined criteria as proposed initially by Alexopoulos and colleagues (1997) includes dimensions of depressive symptoms, disability, and cognitive impairment. Specifically, DED syndrome has been characterized by a loss of interest in activities, psychomotor retardation, paranoia, and cognitive impairment in the domains of language fluency and visual naming. Aizenstein and colleagues (2016) proposed diagnostic criteria for vascular depression that incorporates elements of both clinical and MRI-definitions. This diagnostic criteria is: #Evidence of vascular pathology in elderly subjects with or without cognitive impairment #Absence of previous depressive episodes preceding obvious cerebrovascular disease #Presence of cerebrovascular risk factors #Co-incidence of depression with cerebrovascular risk factors #Clinical symptoms characteristic of vascular depression such as executive dysfunction, decrease in processing speed, and lethargy #Neuroimaging data confirming cerebrovascular disease Studies have not yet been conducted using this set of criteria, so it is unclear whether it provides an advantage over current standards. Some aspects of the criteria are not always necessary to diagnose individuals. For example, one study found that late-onset depression, executive dysfunction, and subcortical gray lesions in individuals were useful for identifying vascular depression, but only the presence of deep white matter lesions was necessary to classify individuals as having the disorder. =Distinction from Major Depressive Disorder= There is inadequate evidence to support vascular depression as a distinct subtype of major depressive disorder due to mixed results. Specifically, it is difficult to differentiate a diagnosis of vascular depression from similar diagnoses, such as post-stroke or late-life depression. Some researchers suggest that vascular depression may be too restricted in its definition and proposed etiology. However, there is some evidence of internal validity of vascular depression which provides initial support for its classification as a unique subtype. The most distinctive symptoms of vascular depression compared to non-vascular depression include increased cognitive and executive impairment, proposed to be associated with cerebrovascular risk factors.Alexopoulos, G. S., Meyers, B. S., Young, R. C., Kakuma, T., Silbersweig, D., & Charlson, M. (1997). Clinically defined vascular depression. American Journal of Psychiatry, 154(4), 562‚Äì565. https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.154.4.562Naarding, P., Tiemeier, H., Breteler, M. M. B., Schoevers, R. A., Jonker, C., Koudstaal, P. J., & Beekman, A. T. F. (2007). Clinically defined vascular depression in the general population. Psychological Medicine, 37(3), 383‚Äì392. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291706009196 Additionally, studies have reported that when compared to individuals with non-vascular depression, those diagnosed with vascular depression tend to be older, have a lower family history of mental illness, and have a history of hypertension. Individuals with vascular depression also tend to have more deficits in self-initiation and concentration, higher cardiac illness burden and cerebrovascular risk factors, cognitive impairment (as associated with the severity of white matter lesions in the brain), and increased treatment resistance. Those with vascular depression have also reported increased lassitude, which is described as a difficulty getting started in the morning and may be related to fatigue. An additional study found that individuals with vascular depression reported greater executive dysfunction and apathy compared to both nondepressed individuals with vascular disease and healthy control participants.Bella, R., Ferri, R., Cantone, M., Pennisi, M., Lanza, G., Malaguarnera, G., ‚Ä¶ Pennisi, G. (2011). Motor cortex excitability in vascular depression. International Journal of Psychophysiology, 82(3), 248‚Äì253. This provides support that these symptoms may be a result of vascular depression specifically and not solely individuals‚Äô vascular disease. Cause Proposed mechanism of vascular depression adapted from Aizenstein et al., 2016 Researchers hypothesize that vascular depression disrupts processes in certain parts of the brain to put individuals at risk for developing depression. Two primary mechanisms have been proposed: one associates white matter lesions (attributed to cardiovascular burden) and cerebrovascular risk factors. These two mechanisms parallel the differences between MRI and clinically defined vascular depression, yet do not necessarily represent contradictory mechanisms. These brain changes are thought to be reflected in the white matter lesions identified by MRI. Cerebrovascular risk factors for vascular depression include high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and tobacco smoking, with high blood pressure being the most commonly identified risk factor. However, these factors do not account for all cerebrovascular changes in individuals as genetics may play a large role as well. Research has found that white matter lesions are particularly important in predicting future depression. Increasing severity, or magnitude, of these lesions predicts an increase in depression over time (as studied in individuals who were already depressed). Additionally, lesions classified as ‚Äòsevere‚Äô demonstrate the strongest association with depression. These white matter lesions also predict future depression risk in individuals that are not currently depressed: non-depressed participants with identified white matter lesions were eight times more likely to develop depression within the next three years compared to those without these lesions. Although the location of these lesions has been studied in connection to late-life depression,Simpson, S., Baldwin, R. C., Jackson, A., & Burns, A. S. (1998). Is subcortical disease associated with a poor response to antidepressants ? Neurological, neuropsychological and neuroradiological findings in late-life depression. Psychological Medicine, 28, 1015‚Äì1026. more research is needed to determine location‚Äôs role in the presentation of vascular depression. Management Several studies show that the lesions associated with vascular depression are linked to poor depression treatment outcomes.Taylor, W. D., Steffens, D. C., & Krishnan, K. R. (2006). Psychiatric Disease in the Twenty-First Century: The Case for Subcortical Ischemic Depression. Biological Psychiatry, 60(12), 1299‚Äì1303. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.05.028 A limitation of these studies is that they lack a measurement of cerebrovascular risk factors before and after the experimental interventions. Therefore, it is unknown if these treatments are targeting these factors specifically or the more general categorization of late-onset geriatric depression. Keeping this in mind, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), nimodipine, citalopram, and carotid stent placements have been shown to be effective treatments for some individuals with vascular depression. Individuals treated with TMS have reported decreased depressive symptoms.Jorge, R. E., Moser, D. J., Acion, L., & Robinson, R. G. (2008). Treatment of Vascular Depression Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation 3.

International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 19(9), 833‚Äì842. https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.1172 However, in one of these studies the results were based on clinically defined vascular depression. When participants were compared according to MRI defined vascular depression, there was no difference in antidepressant outcomes between those fitting this definition and those not. Controversy There are several criticisms regarding the theory of vascular depression. One critique is with regard to the distinction between sufficient and necessary causes for vascular depression. A cause is considered sufficient if its presence is enough to lead to vascular depression, yet it is considered necessary if it is required to develop vascular depression. Some research claims that vascular brain disease is sufficient (but not necessary) for the development of depression, but others have found that ischemic disease may not even be a sufficient causal factor. A second critique of vascular depression relates to the ambiguity about the causal direction between risk factors and depressive symptoms. It is very difficult to determine if cerebrovascular risk factors cause depressive symptoms or if depressive symptoms instead lead to a worsening of these risk factors, and it may likely be both. White matter lesions, proposed to be a causal risk factor, are common in the elderly and are associated with age. Depression and cerebrovascular risk factors are also common in later life. These factors make it difficult to determine what is the causal factor and to tease apart normal functioning from abnormal in the elderly population. A final challenge facing the vascular depression hypothesis is its lack of a formal definition. This makes the disorder fundamentally more difficult to study, especially considering that there is still no agreement on diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, some researchers have found that there is no depression symptom profile specific to those with vascular risk factors, calling into question vascular depression‚Äôs distinction from other depressive disorders. History Vascular depression was defined in 1997 by Alexopoulos and colleagues, who theorized that cerebrovascular disease can put individuals at risk for the development or increase of depressive symptoms in older adults.

Austin's colony. Early life Peter Kerr or Carr was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on September 12, 1795. Kerr and his partner, William Kerr, received title to a league of land now in Washington County, Texas on August 10, 1824. At some point in 1824, he landed at Matagorda Bay and proceeded overland to Victoria, where he established a mercantile business. He was listed in the census of 1826 at a merchant with three servants. Soon thereafter his plans to marry a Spanish girl were thwarted when he was robbed on a trading expedition among the Indians further down the Texas coast. Her father broke the contract because the robbery left Kerr penniless. Kerr obtained a charter ship, which was soon wrecked in a storm. Kerr received insurance money for his ship and bought a hack and a pair of horses, which were in turn wrecked the first time he put them into use. After a trip to Pennsylvania he returned to New Orleans, purchased a still, and put it on a ship to Texas. The ship sailed without him. In 1835, Kerr and Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal drove a herd of horses to New Orleans and sold them in exchange for merchandise for the Texas trade and for arms and munitions for the Texas army. The provisions were loaded onto the ship the Hannah Elizabeth, which was captured by the Mexican Bravo. The William Robbins (later the Liberty), a Texas privateer, recaptured the Hannah Elizabeth and Kerr was able to redeem his property by paying half its worth. On March 24, 1836, General Sam Houston ordered Kerr's arrest on charges of spreading false news and of having befriended the Mexicans. The charges resulted from Kerr's delivery of the news of James W. Fannin's defeat in the battle of Coleto. Although Kerr spoke the truth, Houston could take no chances of a panic among his men.  Entrepreneur and Civic Leader  After the battle of San Jacinto, Houston appointed Kerr interpreter for the Texas army. The Fourth Congress of the new Republic of Texas granted Kerr of land and twenty-four dollars for his services as interpreter. From 1846 to 1848 he was a justice of the peace in Travis County. In 1849 he leased part of the Hamilton league in Burnet County and obtained a contract with the government to furnish beef to Fort Croghan. Kerr obtained a deed from John Hamilton on October 27, 1851, for the entire league, minus on the west side, which Hamilton had sold earlier. Kerr then leased to the government all of the league west of Hamilton Creek, including the land where Fort Croghan was located. Under the provisions of the agreement, if the government gave up the lease, Kerr would received title to all of the improvements that had been made on the land. In 1852, Kerr began laying out the townsite of Hamilton (later Burnet) on the east side of Hamilton Creek and selling the lots. When the county was organized later that year, he donated ten lots for a courthouse square and east of town to the county in order to ensure that Hamilton would be chosen county seat. Kerr soon amassed a sizable fortune as a result of his land dealings and cattle enterprise. When the government abandoned Fort Croghan in December 1853, he sold , including the Fort Croghan site, for $6,000. In a letter to his brother in Pennsylvania in 1858 he estimated his holdings at $50,000. Kerr died on November 21, 1861 and was buried in an unmarked grave in the northwestern section of the Old Burnet Cemetery. Three days before his death he established a will leaving all of his property except his land and $23,499.99 in notes due him to his nephew, William S. Carothers. The land was to be sold after ten years to establish Peter Kerr College at Burnet. Carothers contested the will and had it annulled. The city of Burnet received two acres (eight thousand m¬≤) for a public school.  References   Further reading  *Darrell Debo, Burnet County History (2 vols., Burnet, Texas: Eakin, 1979).

He specialized in internal medicine and later in treatment of alcoholism and addiction to other drugs. He entered the field of addictions while an internal medicine resident at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, where he collaborated with famed Harvard psychiatrist Norman Zinberg on seminal work on heroin addiction (Zinberg & Lewis, 1964; Lewis & Zinberg, 1964). He later served from 1963-1964 as a health policy advisor to Cleveland mayor Dennis Kucinich and became a leading advocate for legalization of heroin maintenance programs (Lewis, 1964). From 1972 through 1979 he directed the Washingtonian Center for Addictions. He became Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in 1975. In 1976 he joined the Brown University faculty as an Associate Professor of Medicine and director of the Program in Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. He was named the Donald G. Millar Distinguished Scholar in Alcoholism Studies at Brown University in 1979 and chaired the Department of Community Health from 1981 through 1986. In 1982, he founded the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies and was designated the Donald G. Millar Distinguished Professor of Alcohol and Addiction Studies as well as Professor of Medicine and Community Health. He directed the alcohol studies center for 18 years prior to his retirement. From 1990 through 1991 he was Scholar-in-Residence in the National Academy of Sciences-Institute of Medicine in Washington, DC. In 1976, Lewis was one of the founders of the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA). He served as President of AMERSA from 1983 through 1985 and became Executive Editor of AMERSA's peer-reviewed, quarterly journal Substance Abuse in 1984. From 1986 through 1995 he was director of AMERSA's National Office, which was located at Brown University. Lewis and David Duncan, in a presentation at the 1996 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association, proposed that an alliance of health professionals could best bring about major reform of America's national drug policies. In 1997, he convened a meeting of 37 of the nation's leading physicians which adopted a policy statement declaring the \\"war on drugs\\" to be a failed approach and calling for adoption of an approach to drug abuse based on prevention and treatment rather than law enforcement. The group of physician leaders incorporated as Physician Leadership on National Drug Policy (PLNDP), with Lewis as its Project Director from 1997 through 2003. In 2004, the organization expanded its membership to include a number of leaders of the legal profession and became Physicians and Lawyers for National Drug Policy. Dr, Lewis continues to serve on PLNDP's Board of Directors. Lewis has been a leading spokesperson for harm reduction (Lewis, Duncan & Clifford, 1997) and for the perspective that sees addiction as being a chronic disease like any other (Lewis, 1994; McLellan, Lewis, O'Brien, & Kleber, 2000). In 1996 Lewis delivered the Norman E. Zinberg Memorial Lecture at Cambridge Hospital/Harvard Medical School. He received the American Medical Association's Education and Research Foundation Award in 1997 for outstanding contributions and leadership in championing the inclusion of alcohol and other drug problems into the mainstream of medical practice and medical education. He received the Distinguished Contributions in the Addictions award from Harvard Medical School in 2002, and in 2004 he received the John P.

The group was led by Johnny Bragg (born either 1925, 1926 or 1929) who had been a penitentiary inmate since 1943 when, at the age of 17, he was convicted of six charges of rape. The Prisonaires were formed when Bragg joined up with two prison gospel singers, Ed Thurman and William Stewart (each of whom was doing 99 years for murder), and two new penitentiary arrivals, John Drue Jr. (three years for larceny) and Marcell Sanders (one-to-five for involuntary manslaughter). History The group was discovered by the radio producer Joe Calloway, who heard them singing while preparing a news broadcast from the prison. He arranged for the group to perform on the radio, a performance which was eventually brought to the attention of Sam Phillips of Sun Records. He arranged for the group to be transported under armed guard to Memphis to record. A few weeks later, \\"Just Walkin' in the Rain\\" was released and eventually sold 250,000 copies. Their success was such that they were allowed out on day passes to tour throughout the state of Tennessee. The band became favorites of the state's governor, Frank G. Clement, and frequently performed at his mansion. The group's legacy was confirmed when \\"Just Walkin' in the Rain\\", written by Bragg, was recorded by Johnnie Ray, whose version sold over eight times that of the Prisonaires. When Bragg's sentence was commuted in 1956, he formed a new group including Hal Hebb, Willy Wilson, Al Brooks and Henry 'Dishrag' Jones, who were known as the Sunbeams. When they were rechristened as the Marigolds they had a No. 8 hit in the US R&B; chart with \\"Rollin' Stone\\" on Decca Records. In 1960, he was arrested for 'parole violation' for being found in the back of an automobile with a white women. It was his wife. This saw him returned to jail for six and a half years. Putting together another group called the Prisonaires, they did not record any material. Upon his further release, Bragg worked in a cemetery.

It was a New York Times best-seller. A mystery involving diverted oil and gas revenues, abandoned pipelines, Washington D.C. insiders, and illegal drugs involves Navajo Tribal Police Sergeant Jim Chee and Bernadette Manuelito, now a federal Border Patrol officer. Each turns to retired Lt. Joe Leaphorn, now called legendary by his colleagues as well as by Chee, for assistance. Along the way, elegant and dramatic romances reach happy conclusions. Plot summary Not long after Carl Manken leaves Washington D.C. to investigate an issue in the news, his murdered corpse is found on the edge of the Checkerboard part of the Navajo Reservation, near the Apache Jicarilla Reservation. Soon, his vehicle is found on the Jicarilla Reservation. Each use of Manken's credit card is monitored by the issuer, a high-level intervention that sends Sgt. Chee and FBI Agent Osborne to retrieve the card from the workmen using it after finding it in trash they picked up. In Washington D.C., the newsworthy issue is the large amount of royalties never paid to the tribes who own the land providing natural resources, including oil, natural gas and coal; the tribes are suing the Department of Interior. Bernadette Manuelito is on routine surveillance in her new position as a US Customs Patrol Officer, when she finds the Tuttle ranch in the boot heel of New Mexico, where a truck with Mexican license plates enters. She investigates, taking photos of the exotic wildlife and the construction project underway, described as a pump for water for the oryxes and ibexes. She shares the prints of her photos with Sgt. Chee, who in turn shares them with Lt. Leaphorn. One of the trucks in her photos is from Seamless Weld of El Paso, Texas, the same company that the dead man reported as his employer on the rental car form. Her boss, Ed Henry, takes the negatives and other set of prints, while taking a photo of her and telling her to leave the ranch alone. On her first successful solo netting, taking in a group of illegal aliens, the brother-in-law in the group recognizes Manuelito from photos circulating among the drug dealers in Sonora, with word to kill her. Her roommate Mrs. Garza calls Leaphorn with this information, because Manuelito will not call Chee. Leaphorn finds that the pathway of the unused pipeline from the now disused Mexican copper mine passes right through the Tuttle ranch, shown on an old map when the smelter was active. He figures the work recently done at each place is to get the pipeline working again, either to divert natural gas or oil southbound, or to bring in drugs, northbound. The Tuttle ranch is a lease on BLM lands, giving Dashee authority to be there; he and Sgt. Chee head for the ranch directly. Directed by her boss to the Tuttle ranch, Manuelito finds herself in an awkward position. The usually locked and guarded gate is swinging open, and no one is in sight. She drives to the building, climbing on her vehicle to look in through the only windows. Three men approach her; Winsor aims his hunting rifle at her. Her weapon is taken by Diego and the four proceed inside the building. Manuelito sees the drugs at the opening from the pipeline. Winsor plans to execute her. Budge tells her in Spanish to claim she is from DEA and willing to take a cut of the money Winsor will get from the amount of drugs she sees, which she does. Winsor talks about the mistaken killing of Manken, who was not involved in illegal drugs, but hunting out the situation on royalties owed for resources extraction, and mentions the fate of Chrissy. Budge takes her weapon from Diego while Manuelito kicks the rifle. Winslow hits her with the butt of the rifle; then Budge shoots Winslow. Budge tends to her wound. He and Diego leave. Manuelito sits in her vehicle, after calling her own dispatcher and the state police for assistance. Sgt. Chee and Cowboy Dashee arrive at the ranch to find her resting in her vehicle. This scene evokes the words from Chee that he loves Bernie, words he could not say these six months. Then he and Dashee listen to what happened, and see the private airplane above, heading for Mexico. Customs officers, the FBI, the DEA, the state and county police, and Dashee of the Bureau of Land Management discuss who has authority, until someone from Homeland Security arrives to trump them all. Manuelito takes pain medication from the medics, who take her to the hospital. In the Epilog: Away in Mexico, Budge finds Chrissy, whom he did not kill, as he loves her and asks her to marry him. Back in Shiprock, Manuelito looks over the trailer that serves Chee as home, suggesting they move it away and build a real house.

Title The title relates to a jargon term in running pipelines. The pig is a piece inserted to clean the pipeline, in more recent days to track the location of leaks and to separate commodities sent through the pipe (e.g., gasoline followed by kerosene). The plot involves two sinister pigs, one in the pipeline and the one who modified the pipeline. Reference is made to a French farming term for the pig in a farmyard who will eat all it can, then block the other pigs from eating, le cochon sinistre, which is the title of this volume in France. Natural, Cultural & Historical References Geographic, botanical, animal, historical, and cultural artifacts and events often play key roles in the Chee/Leaphorn series - either as direct plot elements, to explain character motivations or perspectives, or to illustrate cultural or religious beliefs and practices.Tony Hillerman: A Critical Companion by John M. ReillyTalking Mysteries: A Conversation with Tony Hillerman By Tony Hillerman and Ernie BulowSeldom Disappointed: A Memoir by Tony HillermanTony Hillerman's Navajoland by Laurance D. Lindford and Tony Hillerman Although less true here than for many other novels in the series, such references in The Sinister Pig include: * ANIMAL: Scimitar oryx (exotic game animal raised on the Tuttle Ranch) * GEOGRAPHICAL: Bernadette Manuelito is assigned to patrol the basin and range topography of the rugged Animas Mountains of Hidalgo County in the extreme southwestern corner of New Mexico, also called the boot heel of New Mexico. Manuelito stays in Rodeo. Chee is based in Shiprock, New Mexico, while Leaphorn is in Window Rock, Arizona. The murdered man is found on the Checkerboard reservation, while his car is found in the Jicarilla Reservation. The lands of the eastern portion of the Navajo Nation, in New Mexico, are called the Checkerboard reservation. This arose from the way in which land was given to railroads in the 19th century, leaving questions of who owns land, a problem for police jurisdictions among others. * HISTORICAL: Guatemalan Civil War (motivation for de Baca); Institutional Revolutionary Party (historic basis for de Vargas military association); Phelps Dodge mining and minerals company (historic basis for mines and smelters in southern New Mexico and Arizona); Cobell v. Kempthorne (class- action lawsuit involving claims that the U.S. government incorrectly accounted for Indian trust assets). Narrative style Each chapter of the novel is from the viewpoint of a specific character, rather than the views of Chee or Leaphorn alone. For example, the reader knows what sort of man Winsor is before Chee, Leaphorn or Manuelito know. At the end, Dashee and Chee get lost en route, while Manuelito is facing her tormentor and her two unexpected allies in a small building on the Tuttle ranch.

The range of this snake appears to be tied to the proximity of watercourses, including ones utilized for irrigation and agriculture. It is a subspecies of the milksnake, Lampropeltis triangulum. It is similar in size to other king snakes, averaging long, and like them, is nonvenomous. This species is named in honor of Edward W.

Born on present day Prince Edward Island, Douville survived the 1758 Acadian deportation to France. He joined the French Navy and lived in Rhode Island during the American Revolution. During the American Revolution, he served as a French military intelligence officer who provided General George Washington with British ship and troop movements. Douville also took part in a smuggling mission in 1775, when he brought weapons and gunpowder from the French West Indies to the United States. Douville was one of the original members of the Society of the Cincinnati. Douville died in 1794 fighting for the French during the Glorious First of June.Robert Emlen, \\"Pierre Douville Portrait Collection,\\" Portrait Collection, Brown University Office of the Curator, accessed October 29, 2016, library.brown.edu/cds/portraits/display.php?idno=262 Early life (1745‚Äì1758)  Pierre Douville was born on August 7, 1745, in the town of Havre-Saint- Pierre, otherwise known as St. Peter's, on the island of St. John, which is present day Prince Edward Island. He was the youngest son and the tenth child of Fran√ßois Douville and Mary Roger. Fran√ßois Douville was the first inhabitant of Havre-Saint-Pierre and came to the island in 1719.Georges Arsenault, \\"Honouring the memory of Francois Douville: Havre-Saint-Pierre, or St. Peter's Harbour, is an historical site of great significance\\". Guardian (Charlottetown. 1955) (0832-2708). Originally from Normandy, France, Fran√ßois and Charles Carpentier were shipwrecked on the island in 1719, \\"farther to the east [from where Havre-Saint-Pierre would be settled], at Naufrage.\\" In a 1752 census, Fran√ßois Douville was one of the wealthiest inhabitants on the island, who made his living as a \\"fisherman, navigator, and ploughman or farmer.\\"  Deportation and life in exile (1758‚Äì1763)  In 1758, Pierre's family was forced to leave Havre-Saint-Pierre in what is known as the \\"Grand D√©rangement\\", or the Expulsion of the Acadians. During the French and Indian War, the siege of Louisbourg Fortress in 1758 resulted in the British expelling the French-Canadians from St. John. The British put Havre-Saint- Pierre's inhabitants on a ship to St. Malo and destroyed the town. The ship Pierre and his family were on landed at St. Malo in January 1759 after three months at sea. Within a few months of arriving at St. Malo, Pierre lost three sisters and one brother from disease.  Return to Canada (1763)  Until 1763, Douville and his family lived in Saint-Servan. By 1763, the French and Indian War had ended. Even though France ceded its former colonies in North America, the British returned \\"the island of archipelago of St. Pierre and Miquelon\\" to the French. Douville and his family left Saint-Servan for France's last North American colony in June 1763 on the Marie Charlotte. When the Douville family arrived at Miquelon they were granted land on the Ile-aux- Chiens, or the \\"Island of the Dogs,\\" which was located in the harbor of Saint- Pierre. At an unknown date, the family moved to Saint Pierre and Miquelon.  Life at sea (1763‚Äì1775)  In 1764 Douville left his family for a life at sea. His first job was aboard the fluyt The Nanny. The ship was contracted by the French crown to transport \\"displaced Acadians from Europe to Cayenne in French Guiana.\\" In 1765, at the age of twenty, Douville was promoted to second lieutenant aboard the ship Two Friends. The Two Friends transported 45 Acadians to France from Saint-Pierre and Miquelon in 1765. The 45 Acadians were forced to leave the French colony due to the colony's overpopulation. Between 1765 and 1770, Douville worked on merchant ships that traded goods between Saint-Pierre and Miquelon and New England. Around 1770, Douville moved first to Pawtucket, and then to Providence, Rhode Island. He became \\"a shipmaster working for wealthy merchant houses\\" up until the American Revolution. Douville's knowledge of the New England coast would make him an important asset in the war.  American Revolution (1775‚Äì1783)  = 1775 \\"Arms Smuggling Scheme\\" = In November 1775, Douville was involved in a mission with Nicholas Brown and Jonathan Clark Jr. In a collection of letters from the Naval Documents of the American Revolution, Volume 1, Pierre was referenced in a letter sent from Nicholas Cooke, the Governor of Rhode Island, to General George Washington, on September 9, 1776. The purpose of the operation was to import gunpowder into the United States from either France or the French West Indies. Referred to as \\"Mr. Du Ville\\", Cooke informed Washington that Douville \\"is esteemed a Person every Way well qualified, and to be depended upon, for the Execution of the Plan he proposes.\\" Douville's plan, Cooke explained, was to voyage to Bayonne, France, \\"where he is well acquainted, and there take in a load of [gun]powder\\" onto his ship. The plan would work, Cooke explained, because the ship \\"can be effected in Three Days,\\" which would not be enough time for British \\"intelligence of the Vessel cannot be sent to England timely enough for any measures to be taken to intercept [the ship] upon her Return.\\" In another letter to Washington, from September 14, 1775, Cooke stated that the Colony of Connecticut was meeting that day to discuss Douville's \\"Voyage to Bayonne\\". He recommended that the operation happen now \\"and return upon this Coast in the Winter,\\" because \\"the Enemy's Ships are unable to cruise\\" at that point. Washington approved of the voyage in a response letter to Cooke on September 18. On November 15, 1775, Nicholas Brown sent a letter to Charles Jovett, a shipowner and acquaintance of Douville's. The letter requested Jovett should take a \\"load of good merchtb codfish delivered [to Providence, Rhode Island] between this and the first of March... But above all that Most Wanting is Cannon and Pistle Powder.\\" The codfish would hide the gunpowder that Douville planned to smuggle in from France. Brown sent a letter to Douville and Jonathan Clark on November 15, 1775, confirming the plan. The plan was for Jovett to send Douville and Clark a ship that will either take them to the French West Indies or France for gunpowder and other weapons. Jovett was under orders from Brown to \\"Make full Insurance, upon what interest [Brown] may have onboard his Vessel Agst all resques, in eigther passage from St. Peters here or, from France here.\\" The ship \\"Must be Deld in this Colony before the first day of April next at furthest\\" because the Continental Congress would pay for the gunpowder \\"at half a [Dollar per pound]\\" if the ship arrived in the United States by that date. Unfortunately, Douville and Clark's efforts were for nothing. A letter from Major General Israel Putnam to George Washington on May 21, 1776, revealed that a French ship, called L'Amiable Marie, arrived in Long Island on May 20 with \\"12 Tonns powder-500 Small Arms and dry Goods\\" as its cargo. However, an \\"English Captn with a Boats Crew came on shore for Assistance to land his Goods, soon after the French Capt who was on Board-saw a small Sloop to Leward beating up to him, 'tis supposed he thot them friends\\" and the 'French Capt' \\"immediately weigh'd anchor.\\" The 'French Capt' was Douville. Realizing that the boat was British and not an American ally, Douville attempted to make it to the Jersey Highlands, hoping he could \\"land his goods up one of the short rivers in proximity to\\" where American forces were located. However, the British ship Asia captured the L'Amiable Marie on May 20, 1776. The capture of the L'Amiable Marie was mentioned in a letter sent to George Washington from Commodore Esek Hopkins on September 2, 1776. Based on the information from ContinentalNavy.com, Douville's participation in the \\"Arms Smuggling Scheme\\" of 1775 resulted in the British burning down his family's home in Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. = Lieutenant (1776‚Äì1782) = From 1776‚Äì1778, Douville served on the Continental Navy ship The Alfred as third lieutenant but was promoted to second lieutenant in 1777. In March 1778, The Alfred was captured by British forces near Barbados. Douville would have been sent to Forton Prison in England, but he was exchanged for a British officer \\"held by the French in the West Indies\\" in 1778. Gaining his freedom, Douville was able to be back in Rhode Island in time for his wedding to Cynthia Aborn. July to August 1778 saw Douville serving on the Languedoc, the \\"flagship of the French fleet at Rhode Island.\\" The ship was under the command of Vice Admiral Charles Hector Comte d'Estaing. It has been suggested by some sources that Douville was ordered to be stationed on the Languedoc \\"at the 'particular request' of General George Washington due to [Douville's] extensive knowledge of the New England Coast.\\" In 1780, Douville served as a \\"lieutenant in the Continental navy on the Queen of France and was captured when the ship was sunk during the fall of Charleston\\" in May.Robert Morris, John Catanzariti. \\"The Papers of Robert Morris, 1781‚Äì1784\\". University of Pittsburgh Pre, 1984. https://books.google.com/books?id=AqyUvZlLIoEC&dq;=pierre+douville+1794&source;=gbs_navlinks_s. Fortunately for Douville, he was released at the insistence of Captain La Touch of the French Frigate Hermione'. He and several other Continental Navy officers were released in mid-July. From August 16, 1780, to November 30, 1782, Douville served on Le Duc de Bourgogne which was supplied with eighty guns, Le Neptune had seventy-four guns, and Le Triomphant had eighty guns. When the War ended in 1783, Douville returned to Rhode Island to be with his family.  Career after the American Revolution (1784‚Äì1792)  On October 5, 1784, Douville became a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, an award given to those \\"who had distinguished themselves\\" during the American Revolution. In 1784, Douville resumed working in maritime trading. His work had him make numerous trips to the West Indies on the sloop Cynthia and the schooner Cynthia, both named after his wife. In 1787, Douville brought Cynthia and their son Peter to St. Pierre and Miquelon to live while Douville continued his work in the West Indies. By 1789, the family had returned to Rhode Island. In December 1792, Douville traveled to France, and served in the French navy from 1792 to 1794.  French Revolution (January 1793 ‚Äì 1794)  Douville enlisted in the Navy of the French Republic in January 1793, with a desire to \\"be useful to his country.\\" He was assigned as lieutenant to the ship Achilles, and its mission was to protect the coastline of the Loire River and Brittany. On February 25, 1794, Douville became the captain of l'Impeteux. Douville's ship was part of Admiral Louis-Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse's squadron. Villaret's squadron was tasked with protecting a convoy that was transporting grain from the United States to France. France, in 1794, suffered from famine due to the French Revolution and the British naval blockade surrounding France. The British fleet, led by Admiral Earl Howe, was tasked with destroying the convoy and the French squadron.  Glorious First of June and death (1794)  The French and British fleets engaged in battle on May 28 until June 1, 1794. On June 1, Douville and the rest of the French navy faced off against Admiral Earl Howe\\"in which [Douville] dismasted the British ship of the line, Marlborough, of seventy-four guns.\\" However, Douville gained eighteen wounds from the battle, and he and his ship were captured by the British. Douville died on July 17, 1794, in Forton Prison, located in Gosport, England. He was buried in Portsmouth, England, \\"with the honors of war.\\"  Personal life  Douville married Cynthia Aborn on July 26, 1778, in Providence, Rhode Island, a week after Cynthia turned eighteen years old. They had five children; Pierre in 1781, Cynthia in 1783, Lowrey Charles in 1786, Samuel Joseph in 1788, and Mary in 1789. When Douville died, Cynthia Aborn received a pension from the French Government until her death in October 1806.  In popular culture  One of Douville's descendants was the actor Charles Douville Coburn, an American film actor known for his role in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Brown University has a painting of Douville. The painter is unknown, but it was completed in France before Douville's death. It was given to Brown University in 1887 by Douville's granddaughters, Miss Cynthia Douville and Mrs. Sarah A. Tinkham.

The premises of the zoo have remained closed to the general public following the passing of Hurricane Maria over Puerto Rico in September 2017. Two lion cubs were born at the zoo in 2019.

On March 2008 the zoo acquired two new giraffes and two desert warthogs to augment the African collection. The animals were brought from Ohio and Louisiana. The economic crisis related to the government debt crisis in Puerto Rico, which began in 2014, led to issues with zoo maintenance and animal care.

The Tone-class cruisers were originally envisaged as the 5th and 6th vessels in the . However, by the time construction began, serious weaknesses in the Mogami-class hull design had become clear following the Fourth Fleet incident in 1935. As Japan no longer was obligated to abide by the limitations of the London Naval Treaty, a new design was created and new means of construction were utilized. Though the external dimensions were close to the Mogami class, the design was quite different, with all the main battery of guns placed forward of the bridge, reserving the entire stern area as a large seaplane operations deck. Unlike the U.S. Navy, the Japanese did not have a dual role attack/scout aircraft, nor did they assign any of their carrier aircraft to a reconnaissance role. Little emphasis was placed on this aspect of carrier warfare. Instead the Japanese reserved all of their carrier aircraft for attack roles. Reconnaissance then was relegated to the float planes carried by cruisers. The Tone and the Chikuma were intended to provide the long range reconnaissance needed for Japan's carrier Air Fleets. Design =Overview= The Tone-class cruisers had a very distinctive silhouette, with all main armament concentrated forward and the aft section entirely devoted to aircraft operations. This allowed for strong and compact protection of the magazines while also increasing and improving the living quarters aft. =Armament= Chikuma with turrets trained to port As originally planned, the Tone-class vessels were to have five triple turrets, three forward and two aft. However, the capsizing of the torpedo boat Tomozuru called into question the stability of all Japanese warship designs. As a result of the redesign, and to improve accuracy of gunfire, all five turrets in the new design were concentrated on the forecastle. When Japan abrogated the Washington Naval Treaty on 31 December 1936, the main armament was revised to eight guns in four twin turrets with maximum 55-degree elevation, as was installed on the Mogami-class vessels. No. 1 was forward firing, No. 3 and No. 4 turrets trained through after arcs, while No. 2 was on a superfiring pedestal mounting overlooking No.1 and No.3. Heavy anti-aircraft weaponry consisted of four twin gun turrets in shielded mountings amidships. For close- range, six twin Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Guns were carried. Four triple banks of torpedo tubes were also incorporated. =Hull & Armor= The previous Mogami class experimented with welded hulls, with limited success. Thus the lead vessel in the Tone class, Tone, also had some welding, the subsequent Chikuma was an all riveted design. The undulating hull of earlier cruisers was dispensed with and the superstructure was less built-up. The modifications to the design raised the nominal displacement to about 12,500 tons. The main belt armor was thick next to machinery spaces ( next to magazines), and it extended to a depth of about , beyond which it had a much reduced thickness as an anti- torpedo bulkhead down to the inner double bottom. =Engines= The main engines of the Tone class were similar to that of and . =Aircraft= The Tone class had no aircraft hangar, but there was a comprehensive arrangement of transport rails and turntables on the aircraft catapult and quarterdecks. Two gunpowder-propelled catapults were located on the beam abaft the mainmast. A maximum of four Kawanishi E7K2 'Alf' three-seat floatplanes and four Nakajima E8N1 'Dave' floatplanes could be carried, the normal complement being six, of which four were to be E8N1s. In practice, no more than five were ever embarked. As the war progressed these types were superseded by the Aichi E13A1 'Jake' and Mitsubishi F1M2 'Pete'. Modifications In 1943, the number of 25 mm guns was increased to twenty guns, and in June 1944, when the opportunity to use their aircraft had passed, further mountings were added on the flight deck, bringing the light anti-aircraft total to 54 barrels. Two more twin 25 mm guns were also added later. Radar was fitted, but otherwise no major modifications were carried out. Ships in class Two ships were funded under the 1932 2nd Supplementary Budget, both of which were built by Mitsubishi at the Nagasaki shipyards. = Tone = Tone (Âà©Ê†π) was part of the covering force for the attack on Pearl Harbor, and later that same month assisted in the second Battle of Wake Island. Subsequently, Tone was involved in operations in the Netherlands East Indies. In February 1942, it was part of the covering force for the carrier raid on Darwin, and in March accompanied the battleships and in the sinking of the destroyer . During March Tone participated in the strike by Admiral Nagumo's aircraft carrier force into the Indian Ocean and the attack on Ceylon. Tone returned to the Pacific for the Battle of Midway in May, and from the summer of 1942 was part of the Guadalcanal campaign. On 2 August 1942, Tone was damaged by aircraft from the carrier . In 1943, Tone patrolled in Solomon Islands theatre where it was damaged by an air raid on its base in Rabaul on 5 November. In the beginning of 1944, Tone participated in a strike into the Indian Ocean against Allied shipping on the Australia- Aden route. Later, Tone was in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and as part of Admiral Kurita's Center Force at the Battle of Leyte Gulf attacked US escort aircraft carriers. Tone was damaged by US aircraft in March 1945, after her return to home waters and was finally sunk by aircraft, near Kure, on 24 July 1945. She was raised postwar and broken up at Kure in 1948. = Chikuma = The career of Chikuma (Á≠ëÊë©) parallels that of Tone in almost every detail, since the two ships formed the 8th Cruiser Squadron on completion and operated together for almost all of their careers. In October 1942, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, Chikuma was hit by five bombs dropped by aircraft from the carrier . Chikuma was lost in the Battle off Samar on 25 October 1944.

Although a minor school of thought and politics, composed primarily of campaigners and intellectuals, Australian anarchism has formed a significant current throughout the history and literature of the colonies and nation. Anarchism's influence has been industrial and cultural, though its influence has waned from its high point in the early 20th century where anarchist techniques and ideas deeply influenced the official Australian union movement. In the mid 20th century anarchism's influence was primarily restricted to urban bohemian cultural movements. In the late 20th century and early 21st century Australian anarchism has been an element in Australia's social justice and protest movements.  History  Anarchism has found both proponents and critics during the short history of Australia. International movements, √©migr√©s or home-grown anarchists have all contributed to radical politics during the nation's formation = Beginnings = The Melbourne Anarchist Club was officially founded on 1 May 1886 by David Andrade and others breaking away from the Australasian Secular Association of Joseph Symes, the journal Honesty being the anarchist club's official organ; and anarchism became a significant minor current on the Australian left. The current included a diversity of views on economics, ranging from an individualism influenced by Benjamin Tucker to the anarchist communism of JA Andrews.

The most dramatic event associated with this early Australian anarchism was perhaps the bombing of the \\"non-union\\" ship SS Aramac on 27 July 1893 by Australian anarchist and union organiser Larrie Petrie.B.

He later joined Lane's \\"New Australia\\" utopian experiment in Paraguay. A major challenge to the principles of these early Australian anarchists was the virulent anti-Chinese racism of the time, of which racism William Lane himself was a leading exponent. On a political level the anarchists opposed the anti-Chinese agitation. \\"The Chinese, like ourselves, are the victims of monopoly and exploitation\\" editorialised Honesty \\"We had far better set to and make our own position better instead of, like a parcel of blind babies, trying to make theirs worse.\\"quoted in Andrew Markus, \\"White Australia? Socialists and Anarchists\\" Arena nos 32‚Äì33 (Double Issue), 1973 The anarchists were sometimes more ambivalent on the subject than this statement of principle might suggest; anti-Chinese racism was entrenched in the labour movement of which they were a part, and challenged by few others.Andrew Markus, \\"White Australia? Socialists and Anarchists\\" Arena nos 32‚Äì33 (Double Issue), 1973 = World war = Monty Miller, a veteran of the Eureka uprising, belonged to the Melbourne Anarchist Club. He would later become a well-known militant of the Australian branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and was arrested and imprisoned in 1916. His friend the social activist and literary figure Willem Siebenhaar was among those who campaigned for his release. After the First World War Australian anarchism fell into decline. The tradition was kept alive by, among others, the prominent agitator and street speaker Chummy Fleming who died in Melbourne in 1950 and by Italian Anarchists active in Melbourne's Matteotti Club and the North Queensland canefields.G. Cresciani; \\"Proletarian migrants: fascism and Italian anarchists in Australia\\", Australian Quarterly, 51, (March 1979) pp. 4‚Äì19. Online at http://www.takver.com/history/italian.htm William Andrade (1863‚Äì1939), David Andrade's brother and fellow anarchist, became a successful bookseller in Sydney and Melbourne and while he retired from active politics in about 1920 he continued to influence events by allowing various radical groups to use his premises throughout the 1920s and 1930s. = Post World War Two = After World War Two the Sydney Libertarians developed a distinct brand of \\"pessimistic\\" or \\"permanent protest\\" anarchism, deeply sceptical of revolution and of any grand scheme of human betterment, yet friendly to the revolutionary unionism of the IWW. Poet Harry Hooton associated with this group, and his friend Germaine Greer belonged to it in her youth. By 1972 she was calling herself an \\"anarchist communist\\" and was still identifying herself as \\"basically\\" an anarchist in 1999. The Sydney Libertarians were the political tendency around which the \\"Sydney Push\\" social milieu developed, a milieu which included many anarchists.Anne Coombs, Sex and Anarchy ‚Äì the life and death of the Sydney Push Viking Penguin, 1996 The Sydney Libertarians, along with the remnant of the Australian IWW and of Italian and Spanish migrant anarchism fed into the Anarchist revival of the sixties and seventies which Australia shared with much of the developed world. Another post-war influence that fed into modern Australian anarchism was the arrival of anarchist refugees from Bulgaria.Bob James, \\"Bulgarian Anarchists in Sydney\\" in Anarchism in Australia.

This tendency exploded into prominence in 1982 because of its part along with other anarchists and assorted radicals in the Brisbane free speech fights during the Queensland premiership of Joh Bjelke-Petersen.Ciaron O'ReillyThe Revolution will not be Televised! A Campaign for Free Expression in Queensland (1982‚Äì1983) Online at http://www.takver.com/history/brisbane/freespeechqld.htm In Melbourne in 1977 the Libertarian Workers for a Self-Managed Society (LW) were formed on a theoretical platform similar to the Brisbane Self-Management Group. This Libertarian Workers group engaged very actively in propaganda, which played a major part on making possible the Australian Anarchist Centenary Celebrations of 1986. Apart from generally respectful publicity the lasting consequences of the Celebrations were the founding of the Anarchist Media Institute, its most visible member being Joseph Toscano; and the founding of an Australian section of the International Workers Association (IWA) called the Anarcho-Syndicalist Federation (ASF). A major part of the activity of the ASF was its agitation among Melbourne's public transport workers culminating in a significant influence on the Melbourne Tram Dispute of 1990.Dick Curlewis Anarcho-Syndicalism in Practice: Melbourne tram dispute and Lockout January‚ÄìFebruary 1990 1997, Jura Media Publications Online at http://www.takver.com/history/tram1990.htm In 1982 the paper Rebel Worker began to be published in Sydney as the paper of the Australian IWW.

He died, apparently in France, in 1779. He was director of the Saint-Maurice ironworks near the city of Trois-Rivi√®res in Quebec in the mid-1770s. When the Americans invaded Quebec in 1775, P√©lissier, whom his business associate Pierre de Sales Laterri√®re described as a \\"strong supporter of John Wilkes and his system of freedom\\", strongly supported the American cause. General Richard Montgomery met with him in December 1775 to discuss the establishment of a provincial convention for the purpose of electing representatives to the Second Continental Congress, a step P√©lissier advised against until Quebec City was taken. His ironworks supplied ammunition, bombs, and cannonballs for the siege of Quebec; he also wrote a letter to the Second Continental Congress on January 8, 1776, to point out the measures they should take for a successful taking of Quebec.Griffin, p. 223 As the Americans retreated from Quebec in May and June 1776, P√©lissier fled the province with them. On July 29, 1776, he received an engineering lieutenant colonel's commission in the Continental Army, and in October assisted in the improvement of the defenses at Fort Ticonderoga.Walker, p. 96 He eventually returned to his family home in France.Griffin, p. 230 When he fled Quebec, P√©lissier left behind his second wife Catherine, who began to have an affair with Laterri√®re in his absence. (It is likely that Laterri√®re was also a suitor of hers prior to her marriage.) P√©lissier, apparently unaware of the affair, was eventually granted permission to return to Quebec to bring her to France.

Ltd. is a for-profit social enterprise based in Bangalore, India. SELCO has played an instrumental role in improving living standards of poor households in rural India especially in the state of Karnataka through solar energy based interventions and low smoke cook stoves. In recognition of the services towards reduction of the gap in access to energy, SELCO has been awarded the prestigious Ashden Awards (also known as the Green Oscars) twice, in years 2005 and 2007. SELCO India was founded in 1995 by Dr.Harish Hande an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur with INR 15,000 funding from its co-founder Mr. Neville Williams. SELCO India has installed solar light systems in 350,000 houses till date. Selco Foundation's e-shala (e-school) project takes education to children in rural areas, mostly in areas where power supply doesn't exist by using a solar-powered power storage device, LED projector and tablet loaded with content. History In 1995, the two partnered to found SELCO as an energy services company focused on meeting the needs of people lacking adequate access to energy. Initially, SELF took a majority stake in the new company, with Williams as Chairman, while Hande retained a minority shareholding position and the role of Managing Director. SELCO India eventually came into being in 1995 under the leadership of Hande and Neville Williams, president of Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF). Financial backing was received in December 1996 from Winrock International which released a conditional loan of $150,000 under the USAID Renewable energy commercialization project. This was however on a condition that SELCO INDIA created couple of solar service centers and install a minimum number of systems. SELCO started with a financial model in which each customer would pay 25% of the cost upfront as down payment and will further pay a monthly installment which is affordable and within the average monthly budget of a family in the region. Along with this, the SELCO INDIA also provided a year's guarantee to the warranty of the manufacturer along with free service for a year and a 90-day money back guarantee.

Considered illegal or inappropriate, these actions were conducted from 1959 to 1973. William Colby, who was the CIA director who received the reports, dubbed them the \\"skeletons\\" in the CIA's closet. Most of the documents were publicly released on June 25, 2007, after more than three decades of secrecy. The non-governmental National Security Archive had filed a FOIA request fifteen years earlier. Background The reports that constitute the CIA's \\"Family Jewels\\" were commissioned in 1973 by then CIA director James R. Schlesinger, in response to press accounts of CIA involvement in the Watergate scandal‚Äîin particular, support to the burglars, E. Howard Hunt and James McCord, both CIA veterans. On May 7, 1973, Schlesinger signed a directive commanding senior officers to compile a report of current or past CIA actions that may have fallen outside the agency's charter. The resulting report, which was in the form of a 693-page loose-leaf book of memos, was passed on to William Colby when he succeeded Schlesinger as Director of Central Intelligence in late 1973. Leaks and official release Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh revealed some of the contents of the \\"Family Jewels\\" in a front-page New York Times article in December 1974,Image of the article: \\"Huge C.I.A. operation reported in U.S. against antiwar forces, other dissidents in Nixon years\\". Seymour Hersh, The New York Times, 22 December 1974. (Reproduced by permission of copy right holder; further reproduction prohibited.) in which he reported that: > The Central Intelligence Agency, directly violating its charter, conducted a > massive, illegal domestic intelligence operation during the Nixon > Administration against the antiwar movement and other dissident groups in > the United States according to well-placed Government sources. Additional details of the contents trickled out over the years, but requests by journalists and historians for access to the documents under the Freedom of Information Act were long denied. Finally, in June 2007, CIA Director Michael Hayden announced that the documents would be released to the public at an announcement made to the annual meeting of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. A six-page summary of the reports was made available at the National Security Archive (based at George Washington University), with the following introduction: > The Central Intelligence Agency violated its charter for 25 years until > revelations of illegal wiretapping, domestic surveillance, assassination > plots, and human experimentation led to official investigations and reforms > in the 1970s. The complete set of documents, with some redactions (including a number of pages in their entirety), was released on the CIA website on June 25, 2007. Congressional investigators had access to the \\"Family Jewels\\" in the 1970s, and its existence was known for years before its declassification. Content The reports describe numerous activities conducted by the CIA during the 1950s to 1970s that may have violated its charter. According to a briefing provided by CIA Director William Colby to the Justice Department on December 31, 1974, these included 18 issues which were of legal concern: # Confinement of a KGB defector, Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko, that \\"might be regarded as a violation of the kidnapping laws\\" # Wiretapping of two syndicated columnists, Robert Allen and Paul Scott (see also Project Mockingbird) # Physical surveillance of investigative journalist and muckraker Jack Anderson and his associates, including Les Whitten of The Washington Post and future Fox News Channel anchor and managing editor Brit Hume. Jack Anderson had written two articles on CIA-backed assassination attempts on Cuban leader Fidel Castro # Physical surveillance of Michael Getler, then a Washington Post reporter, who was later an ombudsman for The Washington Post and PBS # Break-in at the home of a former CIA employee # Break-in at the office of a former defector # Warrantless entry into the apartment of a former CIA employee # Opening of mail to and from the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1973 (including letters associated with actress Jane Fonda) (project SRPOINTER/HTLINGUAL at JFK airport) # Opening of mail to and from the People's Republic of China from 1969 to 1972 (project SRPOINTER/HTLINGUAL at JFK airport ‚Äì see also Project SHAMROCK by the NSA) # Funding of behavior modification research on unwitting US citizens, including unscientific, non-consensual human experiments4 documents relating to Dr. Sidney Gottlieb: CIA Science and Technology Directorate Chief Carl Duckett \\"thinks the Director would be ill-advised to say he is acquainted with this program\\" (Sidney Gottlieb's drug experiments) (see also Project MKULTRA concerning LSD experiments) # Assassination plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro; DR Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba; President Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic; and Ren√© Schneider, Commander-in-chief of the Chilean Army.

Writing for The New York Times, Amy Zegart wrote: \\"Given all the illegal activities actually listed in this document, the hidden sections are all the more disturbing.\\" In 2009, Daniel L. Pines, the Assistant General Counsel of the Office of General Counsel within the CIA, wrote a law review published in the Indiana Law Journal challenging the assertion that most of the activities described within the Family Jewels were illegal during the time they were conducted. In his conclusion, Pines wrote: \\"Admittedly, several of the operations mounted during that period failed to comply fully with the laws then in place. Yet, the vast majority of those operations did. Further, except for unconsenting human experimentation, each of the main types of activities depicted in the Family Jewels - targeted killings of foreign leaders, electronic surveillance of Americans, examination of U.S. mail, and collecting information on American dissident movements - was legal in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.\\" Mafia involvement in assassination attempts on Fidel Castro According to the Family Jewels documents released, members of the American mafia were involved in CIA attempts to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The documents showed that the CIA recruited Robert Maheu, an ex-FBI agent and aide to Howard Hughes in Las Vegas, to approach Johnny Roselli under the pretense of representing international corporations that wanted Castro dead due to lost gambling interests. Roselli introduced Maheu to mobster leaders Sam Giancana and Santo Trafficante, Jr. Supplied with six poison pills from the CIA, Gianacana and Trafficante tried unsuccessfully to have people place the poison in Castro's food.

During a hearing held as part of an Article 32 investigation in November 2003, West stated, \\"I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted to take care of my soldiers.\\" The charges were ultimately referred to an Article 15 proceeding rather than court-martial, at which West was fined $5,000. West accepted the judgment and retired with full benefits as a lieutenant colonel in the summer of 2004. Asked if he would act differently under similar circumstances, West testified, \\"If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can.\\" At his hearing, West said that there were no ambushes against American forces in Taji until he was relieved of his leadership post a month later. After West's retirement he received more than 2,000 letters and e-mails offering him moral support. A letter supporting West was signed by 95 members of the U.S. Congress and sent to the Secretary of the Army. =Texas State Guard= On August 29, 2019, West was sworn into the Texas State Guard. The ceremony took place at Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas as part of the festivities of a Texas Rangers - Seattle Mariners baseball game. As per the policies of the Texas Military Department, West retained the same rank he held while in federal military service, lieutenant colonel.West, Allen.

Post-active duty military career (2004‚Äì2007) After retiring from the Army, West and his family moved to Florida. He taught U.S. history and coached track and field at Deerfield Beach High School for a year. He then spent two years working for Military Professional Resources Inc. (MPRI), a defense contractor. While with MPRI, West was positioned in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In that capacity, he was an adviser to the Afghan National Army. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= ;2008 In 2006, 25-year incumbent Republican E. Clay Shaw, Jr. was defeated by Democrat Ron Klein in Florida's 22nd Congressional District. Allen West entered politics in 2008 to regain the lost House seat, challenging freshman incumbent Klein. West received the Republican nomination without opposition. However, he lost to Klein by a margin of 9.4% of the votes. The official results were Klein with 169,041 votes (54.7%), West with 140,104 votes (45.3%), and write-in candidate Michael Prysner with 6 votes. ;2010 West ran in a rematch with Klein. He spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 20, 2010, and was endorsed by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. West was one of 32 African-American Republican candidates for Congress in 2010. He said he supported the Tea Party movement and rejected the notion that the movement was motivated by racism, saying the accusation was a creation of liberal critics and the news media. He was described as a \\"tea party star\\" became a member of the congressional Tea Party Caucus in February 2011. In September 2010, the Florida Democratic Party produced a flyer that contained West's unredacted Social Security number. While the party called it an \\"oversight\\" and offered to pay for identity theft protection, West harshly condemned the flyer for exposing his family to identity theft. West defeated Klein by a margin of 8.8%. Along with newly elected South Carolina Representative Tim Scott, he was one of the first African-American Republicans in Congress since J.C. Watts retired in 2003.NPR It's All Politics, James, Frank , Black GOP Lawmakers Face Tricky Relations With Democrats, January 4, 2011. West raised $5.4 million for his campaign, while his incumbent opponent raised $2.5 million. According to West, \\"...over 97 percent of our donations have come from individual contributions.\\" ;2012 West speaking at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, D.C. West raised more than $1.5 million in the 2011 second quarter to support his 2012 reelection bid. The National Journals Cook Political Report in 2011 named West one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012. Redistricting made the 22nd, which already had a modest Democratic lean, even more Democratic. West faced the prospect of running against West Palm Beach mayor Lois Frankel in the general election. On February 1, 2012, West announced that he would run for reelection in the neighboring 18th District. That district had previously been the 16th, represented by fellow Republican Tom Rooney. However, Rooney opted to seek reelection in the newly created 17th District, a move that was considered likely to dramatically improve West's chances of reelection, although it was still a competitive race. In the new district, West received a primary challenge from Martin County Sheriff Robert Crowder. West did not debate Crowder and said \\"debating an uninformed opponent would waste voters' time\\". Incumbent West defeated Crowder in a landslide, receiving 74.4% of the vote. His general election opponent was Democrat Patrick Murphy, a political newcomer and a Republican until 2011. The campaign featured several negative ads, including one released by American Sunrise PAC that was extremely critical of West's policies and depicted him in violent cartoon action against several individuals. West issued a statement condemning the ad, stating that it \\"plays on stereotypes\\" with the goal of diverting Americans from more pressing matters at hand such as high unemployment. He claimed the ad was released by the family of his opponent. The campaign manager of his opponent, said the ad was from a third party and therefore held no liability for it. After primary opponent Crowder endorsed Murphy, a spokesman of the West campaign said \\"Crowder is a Democrat and a sore loser. I'm shocked he waited this long. Perhaps Crowder hopes to continue cozying up to local Democrats so he can be their nominee against Allen West in 2014.\\" Initial vote counts showed Murphy defeating West by a narrow margin of 2,000 votes. West did not concede, citing irregularities in St. Lucie County where some early ballots may have been counted twice.Florida's West refuses to relinquish seat in Congress to Murphy ‚Äì Yahoo! News Florida state election officials unofficially certified Murphy as the winner.Fla. certifies victory for Dem Murphy, West refuses to concede ‚Äì The Hill's Blog Briefing Room A partial recount of early ballots cast between November 1 and 3, 2012, in St. Lucie County slightly decreased the margin separating the candidates, and the West campaign sought further recounts. West said that if the final results show a loss, he would not cling to his title as a member of Congress, but wanted to ensure a fair election was carried out, raising the potential of a protracted legal battle.Isenstadt, Alex, \\"Allen West digs in\\", Politico, 11/12/12. As of the November 18 state deadline, the St. Lucie County election officials had not completed a recount of all of the early ballots, and so the previously submitted vote count which showed Murphy as the winner by 2,146 votes was submitted to the state election officials. The West campaign conceded the election on November 20, 2012. Meanwhile, Frankel went on to victory in the 22nd. =Tenure= West's rhetoric won him both support and condemnation from differing groups along the American political spectrum. Members of the conservative movement viewed him as a \\"torch bearer\\" and \\"conservative icon\\", with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent both suggesting him for vice president, and Glenn Beck supporting him for president. In January 2013, U.S. Representatives Paul Broun (R-Georgia) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) both voted for West as Speaker of the House, even though he was no longer a member of Congress.Wing, Nick. Allen West Pulls Votes For Speaker Of The House, Despite No Longer Serving In Congress, The Huffington Post, January 3, 2013. Some of his statements include calling President Barack Obama \\"an abject failure\\", ordering both pro-Palestinian demonstrators and the views of \\"chicken men\\" Democrats to \\"get the hell out\\" of the United States, opining that drivers with Obama bumper stickers are \\"a threat to the gene pool\\", and pronouncing that African American Democrats are trying to keep African Americans \\"on the plantation\\", while casting himself as the \\"modern-day Harriet Tubman\\" ferrying them to rescue. In a critical summation of West's style, the liberal magazine Mother Jones opined that \\"[for West] every sentence is a proxy war in the larger struggle between patriots and the 'people in this world that just have to have their butts kicked'\\". In January 2011, West joined House Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman Ileana Ros- Lehtinen (R-FL) in condemning the official flying of a Palestine Liberation Organization flag in Washington D.C. West said that the raising of the flag is \\"an attempt to legitimize an organization with a known history of terrorist actions\\". In February, West described Michael Ledeen as one of his \\"foreign policy heroes\\", and implored his followers to read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals to \\"understand what they're up against\\". Other authors West has cited in helping him shape his worldview include philosopher John Stuart Mill and Union Army General William Tecumseh Sherman. On June 2, 2011, Allen West wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to grant clemency to Jonathan Pollard. Mr. West wrote, \\"After serving 26 years behind bars, Jonathan Pollard's health is deteriorating, as is his wife's. If we can consent to the release by the British of the Lockerbie bomber back to Libya due to health concern, how can we justify keeping Mr. Pollard behind bars when his crimes were clearly not as serious as a terrorist who murdered hundreds of Americans?\\" Pollard was released on November 20, 2015, in accordance with federal guidelines in place at the time of his sentencing. Anne Pollard, his ex-wife, said \\"No one helped him. No government reduced his sentence by even one day.\\"After 30 Years, Jonathan Pollard Released From American Prison ,Haaretz, Jonathan Ris and Reuters, November 20, 2015. Retrieved 16 April 2016. West attempted to cast his work overseas in historical terms, theorizing that America is following in the footsteps of Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, or the 300 Spartan Hoplites at the Battle of Thermopylae, in defending Western civilization against Muslim threats from the Middle East. In speaking on what he believed to be Islam's proclivity for violence, West remarked that \\"Something happened when Mohammed enacted the Hijra and he left Mecca and he went out to Medina, it became violence.\\" Because of this view, in February 2011, West cited the threat of \\"radical Islamic terrorists\\" as his motivation for voting to extend provisions of the Patriot Act; He voted against another extension in May 2011. When asked during an interview with The Shalom Show how he would work with others \\"like Keith Ellison, who supports Islam\\", West stated that Ellison, a Minnesota representative and practicing Muslim, represents the \\"antithesis of the principles upon which this country was established\\". West later argued that his initial comment was misconstrued. He said the comments were \\"not about his Islamic faith, but about his continued support of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)\\". In a Boynton Beach Town Hall meeting, West told the Miami leader of CAIR that \\"I will always defend your right to practice a free religion under the First Amendment, but what you must understand, if I am speaking the truth, I am not going to stop speaking the truth. The truth is not subjective.\\" On July 19, 2011, West sent an email to Democratic representative and Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in response to comments directed at him in a speech the congresswoman made on the floor of the House of Representatives after West had departed the chamber. West's email, which he copied to members of House Democratic and Republican leadership, characterized Wasserman as \\"the most vile, unprofessional, and despicable member of the US House of Representatives\\", said that she was \\"not a lady\\" and asked that she focus, instead, on her own congressional district. This is a long-standing dispute that West says \\"dates back to the disgusting protest you ordered at my campaign headquarters, October 2010 in Deerfield Beach\\". At a town hall meeting in Palm City, Florida on April 11, 2012, West was asked by a man in the audience, \\"What percentage of the American legislature do you think are card carrying Marxists or International Socialists?\\" West responded that \\"there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.\\" When asked to name them, he replied \\"It's called the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\\"Florida Rep Labels Congressional Democrats as Communists by CNN, April 11, 2012 Committee assignments West was appointed to the House Armed Services Committee and the Small Business Committee. * Committee on Armed Services ** Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities * Committee on Small Business ** Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce ** Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight and Regulations Caucus memberships * Republican Study Committee * Tea Party Caucus * Congressional Black Caucus When West joined the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) on January 5, 2011, he became the first Republican to join the CBC since former Congressman Gary Franks of Connecticut retired in 1997.

On May 16, 2013, Fox News announced it had hired West as a contributor to offer political commentary during the network's daytime and prime time shows. Following the Charleston church shooting in June 2015, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley called for the Confederate Battle flag to be removed from a memorial outside the state capital. West referred to the debate over the flag as a \\"manufactured crisis\\" invented by liberals to distract from black-on-black violence.

The Kings of the Lombards or reges Langobardorum (singular rex Langobardorum) were the monarchs of the Lombard people from the early 6th century until the Lombardic identity became lost in the 9th and 10th centuries. After 568, the Lombard kings sometimes styled themselves Kings of Italy (rex totius Italiae). After 774, they were not Lombards, but Franks. From the 12th century, the votive crown and reliquary known as the Iron Crown (Corona Ferrea) retrospectively became a symbol of their rule, though it was never used by Lombard kings. The primary sources for the Lombard kings before the Frankish conquest are the anonymous 7th-century Origo Gentis Langobardorum and the 8th-century Historia Langobardorum of Paul the Deacon.

He was the president and Bible teacher for the international Back to the Bible radio and television ministry. He was president of Davis College (formerly Practical Bible College) in Johnson City, New York, United States. In addition to preaching and teaching, Kroll is a prolific writer, having authored more than 50 books expounding on the Bible and Christian living. Background and education Kroll was born to Frank and Betty Kroll in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania. His father, Reverend Frank Kroll, attended Practical Bible Training School (as it was then called) from 1936 to 1939 and pastored the Park Gate Baptist Church in Ellwood City for years. Kroll followed in his father's footsteps and attended Practical Bible Training School from 1962 to 1965. Kroll earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1967 from Barrington College. He then studied at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, earning a Master of Divinity degree in 1970. He earned the Master of Theology and Doctor of Theology degrees from Geneva-St. Albans Theological Seminary. Kroll did post-graduate studies at Harvard Divinity School, Princeton Theological Seminary, the University of Virginia, and the University of Strasbourg (France). He is married to the former Linda Piper. Their son Timothy has followed his father and grandfather in ministry and is the senior pastor at Northside Baptist Church in St. Petersburg, Florida since 2005. Ministry and teaching career Kroll began his ministry as the pastor of First Baptist Church in Middleboro, Massachusetts (1968-1970). He then taught at Practical Bible Training School (now Davis College) 1971-1973\\\\. From 1975 to 1980, he chaired the Division of Religion at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. On January 17, 1981, Kroll was inaugurated as president of Practical Bible Training School, also teaching Bible and preaching while serving as president. During Kroll's presidency, the school obtained accreditation from the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) and the American Association of Bible Colleges (AABC, now the Association for Biblical Higher Education). He also developed the administration, curriculum, and much of the school's structure as it exists today, now as Davis College. Kroll resigned on April 27, 1990, to become President and Senior Bible Teacher of the Back to the Bible international radio ministry. Back to the Bible Begun in 1939 by Theodore Epp on radio station KFOR (AM) in Lincoln, Nebraska, the Back to the Bible broadcast became a worldwide ministry by the time its founder retired in 1981. Epp was succeeded by Warren W. Wiersbe, former pastor of Moody Church in Chicago, Illinois, who served as leader of the Lincoln, Nebraska-based ministry between 1981-1989\\\\. Dr. Kroll was inaugurated in 1990 as the third president of Back to the Bible, the position he held until 2013. During his 23 years of service to Back to the Bible the ministry outreach grew. At the time of his retirement, Woodrow Kroll was heard daily on 1250 radio stations in the United States and anywhere in the world the English language was spoken. The HELIOS Projects Upon retirement from radio, Woodrow Kroll founded a ministry that gave an outlet for his 50 years of teaching and ministry experience. WKMinistries launched The HELIOS Projects in 2014. Each project was written and recorded personally by Dr. Kroll. The first project is HELIOS CT \\"'Talking Thru the Christian Faith'\\". In 199 sessions, each 20-22 minutes long, Kroll uses a conversational style as if he were sitting across an imaginary table to guide the listener into knowing what Christians believe and why they believe it. In HELIOS GS \\"Telling God's Story\\" he retells 372 stories from the Bible, drawing out spiritual insights and practical lessons from each. HELIOS FF \\"Foundations of the Faith\\" is a more remedial approach to understanding what Christians believe for those who may not yet be literate. Using either a USB, an app, print, or a solar-powered handheld device, The HELIOS Projects are designed to put A Bible and Christian faith education right in your hand.'''

He was the abbot of Mettlach prior to his election in 847 to succeed his uncle, Hetto, as archbishop. He took up his post three years later, but was inadequately trained in theology and politically and administratively inept. In 857, the Annales Bertiniani reported that a dog sat on the archiepiscopal throne of Trier, which was interpreted as an omen portending the fall of Theotgaud. In the middle of June 863, Theotgaud and Gunther, Archbishop of Cologne, the two archbishops of Gallia Belgica, presided over a church synod of all the bishops of Lotharingia held at the bequest of Lothair II concerning his abandonment of his first wife Teutberga and his union with his mistress Waldrada. Pope Nicholas I sent apostolic legates to investigate the matter, but Lothair's bishops affirmed that they had advised him to spurn his lawful wife and take another. Theotgaud and Gunther gave grounds for their actions in a letter which they personally brought to Nicholas. He anathematised the council anyway and excommunicated all the bishops. Theotgaud and Gunther continued to defend their actions in a seven-page tome accusing the pope of unjustly banning them. The tome was sent to the rebellious Photius, Patriarch of Constantinople, and to the bishops of Lotharingia. Even the Emperor Louis II, who had secured the pope's election in 858, supported the archbishops. Theotgaud, who is sometimes regarded as a mere tool of Gunther, returned to his diocese to perform his episcopal and pastoral functions for Easter despite the ban. After the king and his bishops had submitted to the pope, the two prelates gave in and went to Rome in penitence (November 864); Nicholas, however, did not accept it. Theotgaud retired to the Sabina. On 31 October 867, Nicholas sent letters to Louis the German and all the bishops of East Francia announcing that Gunther and Theotgaud were guilty of seven offences and therefore deposed from their sees and never eligible to hold ecclesiastical office again. After the accession of Pope Adrian II, Theotgaud and Gunther returned to Rome (late 867). Theotgaud was now freed from the ban, but Gunther remained excommunicated until the summer of 869, when, after a public retraction, he was admitted by the pope to lay communion at Monte Cassino. Theotgaud did not long enjoy his reconciliation with Rome. He died in 868 in Rome.

The film's plot concerns a lawyer who brings home a wooden puppet that was found buried with a boy supposedly killed by his father. Her 8-year-old daughter Zoe sees the doll and takes it as her own. Soon accidents start happening and Jennifer struggles to find the cause as she begins to question her daughter's wellbeing and whether or not there may be something sinister to the doll.Johnson, Judge David. \\"Pinocchio's Revenge\\" (DVD Verdict, October 15, 2005)Weinberg, Scott. \\"Pinocchio's Revenge\\" (DVD talk, October 15, 2005Vasquez, Felix Jr. \\"Pinocchio's Revenge (1996)\\" (Cinema Crazed, October 18, 2013\\"Pinocchio's Revenge\\" (shade.ca) Plot Despite overwhelming evidence, Jennifer Garrick (Rosalind Allen), the lawyer defending convicted child murderer Vincent Gotto (Lewis Van Bergen), believes her client is not guilty and is hiding the identity of the real killer. A fellow attorney in Jennifer's office (Ron Canada) explains the presence of a large Pinocchio-type puppet sitting in her chair, previously buried by Gotto in his son's grave, as belatedly delivered evidence which she had earlier requisitioned. Intending to examine the puppet in the hope of finding a clue which might prevent Gotto's execution, Jennifer brings it home and her emotionally fragile daughter Zoe (Brittany Alyse Smith) mistakes it for a birthday gift. Zoe develops a relationship with the Pinocchio puppet and becomes unbalanced to an even greater degree. Trouble begins with Zoe's bully at school is pushed in front of a bus, which Zoe blames on Pinocchio trying to protect her. Soon after, Jennifer's boyfriend David Kaminsky (Todd Allen) is knocked down the basement stairs while babysitting Zoe, but is saved when she calls 9-1-1. Later, Zoe is at one of her therapy sessions when her psychiatrist, Dr. Edwards (Aaron Lustig), has to leave the room. Zoe begins talking with Pinocchio about who is to blame for David's accident, with both placing blame on one another. Jennifer and Dr. Edwards watch the argument through a video feed, seeing that Zoe is talking to herself. That night, Pinocchio convinces Zoe to set him free on the pretense that he will admit to David about causing his accident. Zoe makes him promise he will not do anything bad and cuts his strings, at which point Pinocchio takes off for the hospital with Zoe in pursuit. Through a first-person perspective, we see an unknown person walk into David's room and unplug his life support machine, killing him. When Zoe denies to Jennifer that she visited the hospital and blames David's death on Pinocchio, an angry and confused Jennifer to locks the puppet in the trunk of her car. That night, Zoe is left in the care of the babysitter Sophia (Candace McKenzie), who reminds Zoe that she gave Pinocchio a conscience in the form of a cricket she caught earlier. Zoe runs to her room to check on the cricket, only to find it killed. Sophia runs to the sound of Zoe's screams, only to be attacked and killed by someone wielding a fireplace poker. Jennifer arrives home to find the babysitter dead and Zoe standing in a dark hallway. When she tries to confront Zoe, the girl runs away in a panic. As Jennifer explores the house, she is struck by the poker and sees her daughter standing above her with it in her hand. Zoe explains that she just managed to get the poker away from Pinocchio, but before Jennifer can inquire further, she vanishes. Jennifer stands up to see Pinocchio standing in the room, at which point he suddenly turns towards her and attacks her with a knife. Following a pursuit through the house, Jennifer throws Pinocchio through a glass coffee table, only to see that her daughter is suddenly lying in the puppet's place.

Living in a zoo in Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union, Batyr was reported as having a vocabulary of more than 20 phrases. A recording of Batyr saying \\"Batyr is good\\", his name and using words such as \\"drink\\" and \\"give\\" was played on Kazakh state radio and on the First Programme of the Central Television of the USSR ‚Äî Vremya, in 1980. Like all cases of talking animals, these claims are subject to the observer-expectancy effect. Biography Born on May 24, 1970, at Almaty Zoo, Batyr lived his entire life in the Karaganda Zoo at Karaganda in Kazakhstan. He died in 1993 having never seen nor heard another elephant. Batyr was the offspring of once-wild Indian elephants (a subspecies of the Asian elephant) and was the second child of his mother \\"Palm\\" (1959-1998) and father \\"Dubas\\" (1959-1978) had been presented to Kazakhstan's Almaty Zoo by the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The first baby elephant (elder Batyr's brother) was killed by his mom immediately after birth ‚àí at May 15, 1968. Abilities Batyr, whose name is a Turkic word meaning Dashing Equestrian, Man of Courage or Athlete, was first alleged to speak just before New Year's Day in the winter of 1977 when he was seven years old. Zoo employees were the first to notice his \\"speech\\", but he soon delighted zoo-goers at large by appearing to ask his attendants for water and regularly praising or (infrequently) chastising himself. By 1979, his fame as the \\"Speaking Elephant\\" had spread in the wake of various mass-media stories about his abilities, many containing considerable fabrication and wild conjecture. Batyr's case was also included in several books on animal behaviour, and in the proceedings of several scientific conferences. These developments drew a spate of zoo visitors, and brought the offer of an exchange--Batyr for a rare bonobo--from the Czechoslovak Circus; an offer rejected by the zoo's employees. A. N. Pogrebnoj-Aleksandroff, a young worker of the zoo who studied Batyr's abilities and wrote many publications about him, said of the elephant: > Batyr, on the level of natural blares, [Batyr] said words (including human > slang) by manipulating his trunk. By putting the trunk in his mouth, > pressing a tip of the trunk to the bottom of the jaw and manipulating the > tongue, [the elephant] said words. Besides, being in a corner of the cage > (frequently at night) with the trunk softly hanging down, the elephant said > words almost silently‚Äîa sound comparable with the sound of ultrasonic > devices used against mosquitoes or the peep of mosquitoes, which human > hearing hears well until approximately the age of 40. While pronouncing > words, only the tip of the elephant's trunk is clamped inside [the mouth] > and Batyr made subtle movements with a finger-shaped shoot on the trunk > tip\\". Various audiovisual recordings were made during Pogrebnoj-Aleksandroff's studies of Batyr and some of these have been transferred to Russia's Moscow State University for further study. Death Batyr died in 1993 when zookeepers accidentally gave him an overdose of sedatives.\\"The Scene in the Nation and the World\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, September 3, 1993\\"Talking elephant silenced forever\\", Washington Times, September 3, 1993 His death was reported worldwide. Lexicon  It is claimed that Batyr had a vocabulary of about 20 words in the Russian and Kazakh languages. He reportedly imitated the sounds of other animals, and uttered short phrases including words of human slang. Batyr's lexicon list was compiled from audiovisual records, scientific researches and statistical data from eyewitnesses who heard the elephant themselves. Individual and disputable sounds were not considered. All other words as reported by the media were treated as fiction, second-hand and interpretations of retellings. For example, the phrase heard from Batyr as \\"water\\" was reported as \\"the elephant asked to drink\\".

It has offices throughout North America. James E. Challenger is the founder of the company and of the outplacement industry. SHRM (The Society for Human Resources Management) recognized him in 1996 as the creator and pioneer of the outplacement field. James E. Challenger, Founder & CEO, 1966-1998. Chairman, 1998-2019. John Challenger, CEO, 1998-Present James E. Challenger, the company's founder, spent years persuading companies it was good business to be nice to people heading involuntarily out the door. It was good for their image among other people they wanted to keep or attract, he argued. It also could help prevent lawsuits from aggrieved former employees. In 2003, John A. Challenger gave testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business on the issue of permanent job loss in a global economy. In 2002, at the height of the turmoil over corporate governance, The Wall Street Journal invited Challenger to address the issue in a bylined article that appeared in The Journal on June 25, 2002. He served on the labor/human resource committee of The Federal Reserve Bank of for two three-year terms.  Early years  Outplacement services, provided by scores of firms, have become standard at most large companies, but in 1977 it was estimated that only 40% of major American companies offered outplacement. As early as 1977, Challenger, Gray & Christmas was recognized among the oldest and largest outplacement firms. The earliest major customers of Challenger, Gray & Christmas included Motorola Inc., McDonald's, United Airlines, Quaker Oats Company and Sears Roebuck & Company. In 1961, James Challenger was dismissed from his law firm position for taking time off. Though he found a new law job, the experience left him interested in the job search process and the responsibility of companies to take care of their separated workers. In 1966, his desire to help led him to found Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc., the first outplacement firm in the country. He told the United Press International‚Äôs Leroy Pope in 1983: I discovered that nearly everything about job hunting was written by people engaged in hiring, people who were looking at the matter from the wrong end of the telescope, he said. They were interested in what employers wanted, not in what job hunters needed to do. He devised a training, counseling, and support program to help job seekers find new jobs quickly and successfully. He told UPI‚Äôs Cathy Lewandowski in 1983: ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as total job security today. Any individual, no matter what position, should be ready to prepare a clearly defined alternative plan which can be implemented in case of termination.  Publications  \\"Outplacement\\" by James Challenger, 1994. \\"The Challenger Guide: Job-Hunting Success for Mid-Career Professionals\\" by James Challenger, 2000.

It is held after Christmas, typically the following two days directly after the holiday. The firm welcomes news stations and journalists into its HQ office to cover the event, giving access to coaches and the advice they provide. On average, this event has helped 500 callers a year. * Coaches give advice on: * Military to civilian job searches * The job search for new college grads * Retirement * The job search for those over age 55 * Explaining a career gap * Resume writing * Interviewing * Career advancement * Transferring skills * Switching industries * Turning a temporary position into a permanent one * Finding a job after incarceration The hotline does not place callers with new employers, nor can its coaches review individual resumes or point callers to specific opportunities.

As the concept of lifetime employment started to come to an end in the 1980s and ‚Äò90s, founder James Challenger was a critical voice in the national press on the responsibility of companies to help their former workers after a layoff. In 1993, Challenger founded the Challenger Layoff Report which publishes the number of job cuts announced by companies month-by- month.

The natural geographic range extends from Western New York to Minnesota, and south to Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Alabama.Page, Lawrence M. and Brooks M. Burr (1991), Freshwater Fishes, p. 84, Houghton Mifflin, New York, NY. This fish prefers flowing pools of creeks and streams. The extremely similar northern redbelly dace can be distinguished by a rounder, blunter head and a more upturned mouth, as well as by differences in spawning behavior. Also, male southern redbelly dace show a characteristic red belly in spring while their northern counterparts keep a white belly.Richard H. Stasiak (2007), \\"Southern Redbelly Dace (Phoxinus erythrogaster): a technical conservation assessment\\", p. 11, USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Region. Available: http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/ projects/scp/assessments/southernredbellydace.pdf Description Maximum length is reported as 9.1 cm TL, but average length is typically 5.8 cm TL.D.O. Hugg (1996), \\"MAPFISH georeferenced mapping database. Freshwater and estuarine fishes of North America\\" 1278 Turkey Point Road, Edgewater, Maryland, USA. The fish live a few years, the maximum reported at 3. These dace have horizontal black stripes and a silvery area above the black stripe. Males have red or yellow stripes below the main black stripe that are especially evident during breeding season. The southern redbelly dace has two sets of paired fins located distal to the operculum, the pectoral and ventral fins. These are followed distally by the anal fin and caudal fin. All fins are yellow, with the dorsal and caudal fins having a red base at their proximal connection. The caudal fin has a notched shape with two points. The rays in the fins are soft and are called \\"soft rays.\\" Their fusiform body shape is efficient for swimming through moving waters. Distribution and habitat The southern redbelly dace can be found as far west as Colorado and as far east as Pennsylvania.There are populations throughout the midwest from southern Minnesota to Alabama and Mississippi. However, the southern redbelly dace is most populous around the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri River drainages. It is found in temperate waters from 44¬∞N - 34¬∞N. The southern redbelly dace lives in clear, flowing bodies of water, typically streams and rivers. Feeding Southern redbelly daces have a varied diet, including algae, diatoms, and invertebrates. They feed on almost any type of particle in the water for nutrition. More generally, their diet is described as one of \\"vegetation and invertebrates.\\" Conservation status This organism is found in healthy numbers throughout the US, however, isolated populations in Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have become critically imperiled due to isolation. It is not listed on the IUCN red list. Environmental significance The southern redbelly dace is an important environmental indicator of river and stream health. This is because the minnow prefers clear unpolluted waters. They use their vision to find food, so a habitat of clear water is necessary.

It is an adaptation of the 1996 non- fiction book of the same name written by Jon Krakauer and tells the story of Christopher McCandless (\\"Alexander Supertramp\\"), a man who hiked across North America into the Alaskan wilderness in the early 1990s. The film stars Emile Hirsch as McCandless and Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt as his parents; it also features Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Brian Dierker, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, and Hal Holbrook. The film premiered during the 2007 Rome Film Fest and later opened outside Fairbanks, Alaska on September 21, 2007. The film received critical acclaim and grossed $56 million worldwide. It was nominated for two Golden Globes and won the award for Best Original Song: \\"Guaranteed\\" by Eddie Vedder. It was also nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Editing and Best Supporting Actor for Holbrook.  Plot  In April 1992, Christopher McCandless arrives in a remote area called Healy, just north of Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. Noting McCandless' unpreparedness, the stranger who drops him off gives him a pair of gumboots. McCandless travels into the wilderness and sets up a campsite in an abandoned city bus, which he calls \\"The Magic Bus.\\" At first, McCandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around him, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts with a .22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares himself for a new life in the wild. = Flashback = Two years earlier, in May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from Emory University, but is shown to have become disenchanted with modern society after discovering he and his sister Carine were born out of wedlock when his father was married to another woman. Shortly afterwards, he rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents. He donates nearly all of his savings to Oxfam and sets out on a cross-country drive in his Datsun 210 to experience life in the wilderness. McCandless does not tell his parents, Walt and Billie, nor Carine what he is doing or where he is going and refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, causing his parents to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate. At Lake Mead, McCandless' car is caught in a flash flood, causing him to abandon it and begin hitchhiking. He burns what remains of his cash and assumes a new name: \\"Alexander Supertramp.\\" In Northern California, McCandless encounters a hippie couple named Jan Burres and Rainey. Rainey tells McCandless about his failing relationship with Jan, which McCandless helps rekindle. In September, McCandless arrives in Carthage, South Dakota and works for a contract harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg. He is forced to leave after Westerberg is arrested for satellite piracy. McCandless then travels on the Colorado River and, though told by park rangers that he may not kayak down the river without a license, ignores their warnings and paddles downriver until he eventually arrives in Mexico. There, his kayak is lost in a dust storm, and he crosses back into the United States on foot. Unable to hitch a ride, he travels on freight trains to Los Angeles. Not long after arriving, however, he starts feeling \\"corrupted\\" by modern civilization and decides to leave. Later, he is forced to resume hitchhiking, after being beaten by railroad police. In December 1991, McCandless arrives at Slab City, in the Imperial Valley, and encounters Jan and Rainey again. There, he also meets Tracy Tatro, a teenage girl who shows interest in McCandless, but he rejects her because she is underage. After the holidays, McCandless decides to continue heading for Alaska. One month later, camping near Salton City, McCandless encounters Ron Franz, a retired widower who lost his family in a car accident while he was serving in the United States Army. He now occupies his time in a workshop as an amateur leather worker. Franz teaches McCandless the craft of leatherwork, resulting in the making of a belt that details McCandless' travels. After spending two months with Franz, McCandless decides to leave for Alaska, despite this upsetting Franz, who has become quite close to McCandless. On a parting note, Franz gives McCandless his old camping and travel gear, along with the offer to adopt him as his grandchild, but McCandless simply tells him that they should discuss this after he returns from Alaska. =Flashforward= Four months later, at the abandoned bus introduced at the beginning of the film, life for McCandless becomes harder, and he makes several poor decisions. He tries to live off the land and hunts down a large moose with his rifle, but becomes quite distraught when he finds that he can't preserve the meat and it spoils within days. As his supplies dwindle, he realizes that nature is harsh and uncaring. McCandless concludes that true happiness can be found only when shared with others, and he seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. However, he finds that the stream he had crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent due to the snow thaw, and he is unable to cross. Saddened, he returns to the bus. In a desperate act, McCandless is forced to gather and eat roots and plants. He confuses similar plants and eats a poisonous one, falling sick as a result. Slowly dying, he continues to document his process of self-realization, and imagines what it might have looked like if he had managed to return to his family. He writes a farewell note to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die. The epilogue states that, two weeks later, his body is found by moose hunters. Shortly afterwards, Carine returns to Virginia with her brother's ashes in her backpack.  Cast   Production  The scenes of graduation from Emory University in the film were shot in the fall of 2006 on the front lawn of Reed College. Some of the graduation scenes were also filmed during the actual Emory University graduation on May 15, 2006. The Alaska scenes depicting the area around the abandoned bus on the Stampede Trail were filmed south of where McCandless actually died, in the tiny town of Cantwell. Filming at the actual bus would have been too remote for the technical demands of a movie shoot. A replica bus used in the movie is now a tourist attraction at a restaurant in Healy, Alaska. Brian Dierker, who plays a major supporting role in the film as Rainey, had no previous acting experience and became involved in the production to be a guide for the rafting scenes.  Release  = Critical response= The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of 198 reviews of the film were positive, with an average rating of 7.51/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"With his sturdy cast and confident direction, Sean Penn has turned a complex work of nonfiction like Into the Wild into an accessible and poignant character study.\\" Metacritic assigned the film an average score of 73 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and described it as \\"spellbinding.\\" Ebert wrote that Emile Hirsch gives a \\"hypnotic performance,\\" commenting: \\"It is great acting, and more than acting.\\" Ebert added, \\"The movie is so good partly because it means so much, I think, to its writer-director, Sean Penn.\\" = Accolades =  Winnings  * 65th Golden Globe Awards ** Best Original Song ‚Äì Motion Picture (\\"Guaranteed\\") * Gotham Awards ** Best Feature Film * Mill Valley Film Festival ** Best Actor (Emile Hirsch) * Palm Springs International Film Festival ** Director of the Year Award (Sean Penn) ** Rising Star Award Actor (Emile Hirsch) * National Board of Review ** Breakthrough Performance ‚Äì Male (Emile Hirsch) * Rome Film Festival ** Jury Award (William Pohlad), (Art Linson), (Sean Penn) * S√£o Paulo International Film Festival ** Best Foreign Language Film (Sean Penn)  Nominations  * 80th Academy Awards80th Academy Awards ** Best Supporting Actor (Hal Holbrook) ** Best Film Editing (Jay Cassidy) * 65th Golden Globe Awards ** Best Original Score ‚Äì Motion Picture (Michael Brook, Kaki King, Eddie Vedder) * American Cinema Editors ** Best Edited Feature Film ‚Äì Dramatic (Jay Cassidy) * Broadcast Film Critics Association ** Best Film ** Best Actor (Emile Hirsch) ** Best Supporting Actor (Hal Holbrook) ** Best Supporting Actress (Catherine Keener) ** Best Director (Sean Penn) ** Best Writer (Sean Penn) ** Best Song (\\"Guaranteed\\") * 34th C√©sar Awards ** Best Foreign Film * Chicago Film Critics Association Awards ** Best Picture ** Best Screenplay ‚Äì Adapted (Sean Penn) ** Best Supporting Actor (Hal Holbrook) * Directors Guild of America Awards ** Best Director ‚Äì Film (Sean Penn) * Cinema Audio Society ** Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for Motion Pictures * Costume Designers Guild Awards ** Excellence in Costume Design for Film ‚Äì Contemporary * Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards ** Best Foreign Film ‚Äì English Language (Sean Penn) * Grammy Awards ** Best Song Written for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media (\\"Guaranteed\\") * Gotham Awards ** Breakthrough Actor (Emile Hirsch) * Satellite Awards ** Best Original Song (\\"Rise\\") * Screen Actors Guild Awards ** Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture ** Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role (Emile Hirsch) ** Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role (Hal Holbrook) ** Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role (Catherine Keener) * USC Scripter Award ** USC Scripter Award (Sean Penn) (screenwriter), (Jon Krakauer) (author) * Writers Guild of America Awards ** Best Adapted Screenplay (Sean Penn)  Top ten lists  The American Film Institute listed the film as one of ten AFI Movies of the Year for 2007..

And I really didn't think anything was gonna come out of it. Maybe a little piece or something\\".  Aftermath  The abandoned and decaying bus on the Stampede Trail where McCandless died became a pilgrimage destination for fans. It was located in Denali Borough, Alaska, 30 miles (50 km) from the nearest town. The bus was taken to the remote trail in the 1940s by a road crew, according to Denali Borough Mayor, Clay Walker. Visitors to the site had to cross the dangerous Teklanika River. In 2019 a newlywed Belarusian woman drowned trying to cross the swollen river on her way to the site. Another drowning took place in 2010. Five Italians were rescued in February 2020, with one suffering from severe frostbite, and a stranded Brazilian had to be rescued in April 2020. In total, 15 bus-related search and rescue operations for visitors were carried out between 2009 and 2017. On June 18, 2020 the bus was removed due to public safety concerns.

History Along with Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, this is one of two Franciscan churches in Venice. The site, originally a vineyard (vigna), was donated by Marco Ziani in 1253 for construction of the monastery. A tiny chapel already on the site recalled the spot where an angel supposedly had pronounced Pax tibi Marce, evangelista meus to the shipwrecked Saint Mark, patron of Venice. The first church at the site was a triple-nave Gothic church by Marino da Pisa. A monastery housed the Frati Minori dell'Osservanza, while the Conventuali occupied the Frari across town. By the 16th century, the church building was in need of repair. Two main impulses led to the reconstruction of this church; one was the reform sweeping the order of the Franciscan Observants, and the other was the wishes of Doge Andrea Gritti, whose family palace neighboured the church. In 1534, this Doge laid the foundation stone for the new church. The nave was roofed over by 1554.  Exterior  The church was designed in sober Renaissance style by Jacopo Sansovino in 1554, with the advice of the Franciscan friar, Fra Francesco Zorzi. Fra Zorzi based the sizing of the various elements on the number three, because of its association with the Trinity: the nave should be nine paces wide and 27 paces long, each side chapel three paces wide. However the white marble fa√ßade (1564-1570) was not based on Sansovino's designs, but instead was a product of an Andrea Palladio. It is thought that the patrician Daniele Barbaro lobbied for the commission to be switched from Sansovino to Palladio in 1562, convincing the then Patriarch, Giovanni Grimani. Palladio addressed the challenge of linking the central nave with the side aisles in the fa√ßade in an innovative manner. The Corinthian columns in both the center and the sides are perched on the same high plinth, though the central four columns are taller and wider than the lateral ones. The lateral columns support half-pediments that mimic the angle of the central full pediment. Above the central portal is a hemicircular window, interrupted superiorly by a bracket and subdivided into three parts. The fa√ßade contains two large bronze statues of Moses and Saint Paul (1592), actively stepping forward from their shallow niches, sculpted by Tiziano Aspetti. At the top of the tympanum, an eagle unfolds a banner stating Renovabitur. Below, a frieze dedication of the church states: Deo utriusque templi aedificatori ac reparatori (God, builder and restorer of both temples) is engraved. Four marble plaques state: Ac cede ad hoc / ne deseras spirituale / non sine iugi exteriori / interiorique bello (Enter here / not abandoning the spirit / not without detaching yourself from the exterior world / and making your interior beautiful).St. Bernardino Institute of Ecumenical Studies website, entry on church. Inside the church, each chapel was sold for 200-350 ducats to aristocratic donors, raising much needed construction funds, granting the rights to place their coat-of-arms in the chapel and to bury their family there. For the right to be buried in the floor of the chancel in front of the high altar, Doge Andrea Gritti paid 1000 ducats. In 1542, Vettor Grimani and his brother Cardinal Marino acquired rights to build the facade for the church. The three sarcophagi for two cardinals and a patriarch from the Grimani family are no longer in place. The facade of the church was ultimately commissioned from Andrea Palladio (1562) by Giovanni Grimani. In the 1950s were cast the 5 bells in B rung with the Veronese bellringing art.

The choir, which in the past was occupied by the monks during services, is behind the altar. The interior contains an alabaster sculpture of St. Louis of Toulouse and an early 15th-century Gothic painting of the Madonna of humility. The Grimani chapel (first in the left aisle) is decorated with ceiling paintings by Battista Franco, and murals and altarpiece by Federico Zuccari. The chapel has been restored by the British charity Venice in Peril, which also restored Palladio's facade in the 1990s. The chapels of the church house masterpieces that both were made for this church or were moved here mainly in the 19th century from shuttering churches, oratories, and monasteries. They belong to some of the most prominent aristocratic families in Venice.

The seven angelic virtues are found in the squares and in the eight circles the human virtues by Battista Franco called Semolei (1561). The altar whose altarpiece shows the \\"Adoration of the Magi\\" in 1564 by Federico Zuccari, was painted in oil directly on the marble. This choice explains the state of the work.

Nicola da Urbino, Count of Montefeltro, in 1397 draws up a will by which he gives the Procurator of San Marco 2000 gold coins. He asks that a third of this sum be allocated to the constitution of a chapel in the church of San Marco. The vow will not be respected and it is only 150 years later that the chapel is erected on the occasion of the reconstruction of San Francesco della Vigna. It is under the patronage of Anthony the Great (Sant'Antonio abate). The altar and the marble altarpiece date from 1561, they are due to Francesco Smeraldi. The three statues are of Alessandro Vittoria (1563): in the center of San Antonio Abatea, right St. Sebastian, on the left St. Roch.

The two are separated by the main altar and a partition. On each side, an apsidal chapel. On the right side of the vestibule is a picture by Palma il giovane: the flagellation; below, an icon (tempera on wood), anonymous work of the end of the XIVth century: Madonna dell'Umilt√† . * On the left wall, the funerary monument and the epitaph of the doge Andrea Gritti (died in 1538), a work of the Palladian school of the mid-16th century. On the right wall is the monument of Senator Tridiano Gritti, who died in 1474. * The high altar: The design and the sculptures are attributed to Girolamo Campagna in the second half of the XVIth. Initially the two groups of four wooden columns contained the statues of Francis of Assis and Antony of Padua. The center has the unusual characteristic of not having an altarpiece, but a cross. In 1649 Baltasarre Longhena was commissioned to modify the altar. Above the eight Corinthian columns it has set up a cornice in the baroque style. In the second half of the 19th century, a large tabernacle was built from the ruined church of Santa Lucia, the statues of St. Francis and St. Anthony were removed from the altar and out of the side doors of the choir brothers. In 1939 the tabernacle, deemed too ostentatious for the Franciscan ideal, was changed. On the pediment of the triumphal arch, the Eternal Father; and on the sides, the Annunciation in painted wood (second half of the sixteenth century): these are attributed to Girolamo Campagna.

Plot Truck driver Jack Willis from rural Australia writes a bestselling novel, but because of its romantic content uses the name, 'Ruby Vale', the name of his best friend. When a publisher - Ziggy - decides to take the author \\"Ruby Vale\\" on, Jack is suddenly faced with a dilemma. He tells his friend Ruby what he has done, and initially she wants to tell the publisher. Jack and his agent convince her to stay silent, and in exchange, they'll organise her wedding (she is marrying Jack's best friend, Hamish) and Ruby is convinced. Ruby and Jack go to Sydney to help promote the book. On the way, Ruby reads his book and realises the lead female character is herself, and the male protagonist, Brian, is Jack. She is deeply touched. Hamish arrives in Sydney. He knows Jack is the author and tells Ruby he knows , just before she is about to go on a satellite feed through to London. All of this is too much for Ruby and she makes her way back to her hometown. Jack does not follow her, instead staying in Sydney whilst trying to decide. Back at home in the pub, Ruby hears Jack's voice coming from the TV. She hears him admit that he is the book's author. Hamish breaks up with Ruby, knowing she really loves Jack. As Ruby is driving home, she sees a plane flying overhead, spelling the words \\"I love you\\". As she stops her car, the plane lands in front of her.

The Senior Dialogue has been upgraded to the strategic track of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue in the Obama administration and will be headed by Hillary Clinton and Dai Bingguo. Purpose The Senior Dialogue was conceived at a 2004 APEC meeting, after a suggestion made by Chinese President Hu Jintao to U.S. President George H. W. Bush to create a forum where the global superpower and emerging global player could come together and discuss issues of mutual concern. The typically two- day rounds help establish a framework for bilateral cooperation between the two countries, and give the U.S. an opportunity to shape China's impact on the world as its economy continues to industrialize. Integrating China into the world's security, economic and political systems continues to be the U.S.'s current policy in dealing with China's rise on the global sphere. However, China's current international economic policies are increasingly rankling American workers and businesses, among others around the world who consider China's trade practices unfair. On June 13, 2007, four U.S. senators introduced a bill that would pressure China to allow its currency to rise in value, which would help close the huge U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a record $233 billion in 2006. However, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson believes in pursuing a less confrontational and non-protectionist approach.

He has developed the idea that certain preon models may be represented topologically, rather than by treating preons as pointlike particles. His ideas have attracted interest in the field of loop quantum gravity, as they may represent a way of incorporating the Standard Model into loop quantum gravity. This would make loop quantum gravity a candidate theory of everything. Career In 2004 and 2005 Bilson-Thompson was a Visiting Academic at the University of Adelaide. From 2006 to 2009 he was a full-time academic at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. From 2010 he held a Ramsay Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Adelaide, Australia.  Summary of Bilson-Thompson's research  There have been recent claims that loop quantum gravity may be able to reproduce features resembling the Standard Model. So far only the first generation of leptons and quarks with correct parity properties have been modelled by Sundance Bilson-Thompson using preons constituted of braids of spacetime as the building blocks. However, there is no derivation of the Lagrangian that would describe the interactions of such particles, nor is it possible to show that such particles are fermions, nor that the gauge groups or interactions of the Standard Model are realised. Utilization of quantum computing concepts made it possible to demonstrate that the particles are able to survive quantum fluctuations. In a 2005 paper, Sundance Bilson-Thompson proposed a model which adapted the Harari Rishon Model to preon-like objects which were extended ribbons, rather than point-like particles. This provided a possible explanation for why ordering of the subcomponents matters (giving rise to colour charge) whereas in the older Rishon Model, this feature must be treated as an ad hoc assumption. Bilson-Thompson refers to his extended ribbons as \\"helons\\", and his model as the Helon Model. This model leads to an interpretation of electric and colour charge as a topological quantities: electric charge as the number of twists carried on the individual ribbons, and colour charge as the number of variants of such twisting for a fixed electric charge. In a subsequent paper from 2006 Bilson-Thompson, Fotini Markopolou, and Lee Smolin suggested that in any of a class of quantum gravity theories similar to loop quantum gravity in which spacetime comes in discrete chunks, excitations of spacetime itself may play the role of preons, and give rise to the standard model of particle physics as an emergent property of the quantum gravity theory. Consequently, Bilson-Thompson et al. proposed that loop quantum gravity could reproduce the standard model. In this scenario the four forces would already be unified. The first generation of fermions with correct charge and parity properties have been modelled using preons constituted of braids of spacetime as the building blocks. Bilson-Thompson's original paper suggested that the higher-generation fermions could be represented by more complicated braidings, although explicit constructions of these structures were not given. The electric charge, colour, and parity properties of such fermions would arise in the same way as for the first generation. The model was expressly generalized for an infinite number of generations and for the weak force bosons, but not for photons or gluons, in a 2008 paper by Bilson- Thompson, Hackett, Kauffman and Smolin.Bilson-Thompson, Hackett, Kauffman, and Smolin (2008).

In typography, a margin is the area between the main content of a page and the page edges.\\"margin\\" in Merriam-Webster online dictionary. m-w.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. The margin helps to define where a line of text begins and ends. When a page is justified the text is spread out to be flush with the left and right margins. When two pages of content are combined next to each other (known as a two-page spread), the space between the two pages is known as the gutter.Typographic Terms. Whatstype.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-30. (Any space between columns of text is a gutter.) The top and bottom margins of a page are also called \\"head\\" and \\"foot\\", respectively. The term \\"margin\\" can also be used to describe the edge of internal content, such as the right or left edge of a column of text. Marks made in the margins are called marginalia.  History  = The Scroll = Margins are an important method of organizing the written word, and have a long history. In ancient Egypt, writing was recorded on papyrus scrolls. Egyptian papyrus scrolls could reach up to 30 metres in length, and contained text organized in columns laid out from left to right along the scroll. Columns were referred to as pagina (or pages) and were separated by margins, so that scrolls could be unrolled horizontally, uncovering individual sections one by one. Thus, in papyrus scrolls margins performed the function of visually signaling to readers when to stop reading and move down to the next line of text. = The Codex = During the first 3 centuries B.C.E., the scroll gradually began to be replaced by the codex. Rather than storing text on one long, continuous piece of papyrus, the codex was constructed of individual pieces of parchment, bound together on one side. Now that each page was separated physically from all the rest, margins became less necessary in distinguishing the beginning and end of the text-block. However, they took on a new role. Before the codex, commentaries about a text were usually recorded on separate scrolls. With the advent of the codex, margins (having been largely stripped of their original function) became extra space which could be used to incorporate commentaries next to the original text. Extra text and images included in the margins of codices are called marginalia. Scholarly commentaries included in margins next to their source text are known as scholia. However, this was not the only purpose margins served in the codex. Even when no commentaries were added, most books continued to leave space around the text-block on all sides of each page. This marginal space served several practical purposes. Leaving blank space around text protects the typeblock by giving the reader somewhere to put his or her thumbs while holding the book. In addition, that blank space serves an important role in reading and understanding text. The exact effect of margins on legibility has been debated, but some scholars contend that without empty space to offset text, the task of reading could take more than twice as long. Finally, margins serve an aesthetic function by framing text inside a blank border. =The Printed Book= With the invention of the printing press, books began to be manufactured in large numbers. As paper began to be produced in bulk, page size and shape were increasingly determined by the size and shape of mould which was most practical for producers. As pages became more standardized, so did the size and shape of margins. In general, margins in books have grown smaller over time. The wide margins common during the Renaissance have given way to much narrower proportions. However, there is still much variation depending on the size and purpose of the book. =The Digital Page= Computers and the Internet have revolutionized our consumption of the written word. Books can now exist without physical pages, and text can be viewed on a myriad of devices. In the early days of the Internet, the concept of margins was foreign to web browsers. However, as computer screens got bigger this became an issue for the readability and aesthetics of text. The invention of more sophisticated techniques such as CSS allowed designers to control the margins of their web pages and leave more white space. Although margin-less web pages do still exist, today it is generally understood that having wide enough margins to provide adequate white space around text is important to the usability and readability of digital text. In fact, margins become even more important because web content shares visual space with other elements such as the web browser's interface, as well as other icons and windows. Margins also play an important role in digital word-processing. The default margins for Microsoft Word from version 2007 onward have been 1 inch (25.4 mm) all around; in Word 2003, the default top and bottom margins were 1 inch (25.4 mm), but 1.25 inches (31.7 mm) were given at the left and the right.Page borders ‚Äî inches or millimetres?Default Print Margin in Word Documents and our Environment.

The game was released on June 26, 2007. Gameplay The basic gameplay consists of a gondola controlled by the player that shoots various treasures (Keys, Hearts, Coins, Rings, Vases, Stars and Lyres) directly upward towards plates that have matching slots on the side of a building in an attempt to match the treasure with its matching slot. Plates come in varied shapes such as bars, circles, half-circles, T-shapes, and X-shapes. They may hold as few as one and as many as eight treasure slots, and they may not be stationary. Some feature hinges that cause them to rotate when hit, while others shift or rotate positions when hit. The player usually has the ability to cycle between two treasures before firing. If a player manages to hit a high matching slot, the treasure will usually tumble and fill one or more lower slots for a combo bonus; each successive tumble increases the bonus and the chance of a power-up popping up. Bank shots earn extra points; when a treasure makes an inordinate amount of banks shots before filling a slot, the player is given a \\"Lucky shot\\" bonus. Once a grouping of slots are filled, that grouping vanishes and awards the player more points. A fired treasure can be diverted by obstacles that include bumpers (stone walls or ledges off of which treasures will bounce), locks and blocks (barriers that require a specific treasure to unlock), bricks (obstacles that crumble when hit), chutes (cylinders that redirect any treasure fired into them), shelves (special plates that hold a number of treasures), teleports (swirly objects that warp treasures from point to point) and baskets (objects that catch treasures and then drop them). If a player misfires, the treasure will either shatter after a long period of bouncing around the screen, or it will plunge into the water, costing the player one of three lives for that level. The player may prevent this by catching the treasure before it plunges. After each section of a building is completed, the water level rises to introduce a new part of the building, until all the sections are completed to finish the level. When a level is completed, the player receives scoring for accuracy, speed of completion, number of combos scored, and how many tries the player took to complete a level. Game modes The game includes four game modes, three of which must be unlocked: *Journey: Basic gameplay *Flood: An action mode in which the river level rises at a steady rate. Icons that splash in the water no longer cost the player, but sections must be completed before the water level engulfs them or the level is failed. *Survival: Like Flood mode, but a single building that never ends. *Trick shots: Nothing but trick shots. The player is given a reward of 1,000 points for a successful trick shot, incrementing 1,000 points with each successful trick shot, and resetting to 1,000 after a failure. There are 72 total buildings (levels) in the game among 8 neighborhoods. As with most PopCap games, Venice features online leaderboards.

Biography Yoshio James Yoda was born March 31, 1934 in Tokyo, Japan. He attended high school and studied law in Japan prior to studying at the University of Southern California in the late 1950s, earning a degree in cinema arts. Yoda began his career in acting as Sgt. Roy Tada in the movie The Horizontal Lieutenant (1962). He is best known for his portrayal of Takeo Fujiwara in the television series McHale's Navy and in the 1964 movie McHale's Navy and its 1965 sequel McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force. In McHale's Navy Season 4, Episode 1, \\"War, Italian Style\\", it is thought that his character is given the full name 'Fujiwara Takeo Kobiashi'. In that episode Fuji learned from Nisei SSgt. George Kobiashi of the famous 442nd Nisei Combat Team (played by Lloyd Kino), that they were second cousins because Kobiashi was Fuji's mother's maiden name. There is a Japanese tradition, in which the husband takes the name of the bride, only in the case which the family has no male heirs, thereby saving the surname of the bride's family. After finishing McHale's Navy in 1966, Yoda appears to have had just one further role, in the 1969 segment of Love American Style entitled Love and the Letter. He was associate producer for \\"The Walking Major\\", which was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1971. In the cast reunion extra feature on the McHale's Navy first season DVD set, Edson Stroll (Virgil in the series) stated that Yoda began primarily using his middle name of James and worked as a Toyota vice-president. He also reported that Yoda had secured his American citizenship. Yoda had lived in Honolulu, Hawaii for fifteen years, serving as vice president of marketing for Toyota in Hawaii, where he had become a United States citizen and was active in the Lions Club. Since 2012, Yoda has been living in Fullerton, California.

John Paul M√©daille was born 29 January 1618 at Carcassonne, Department of Aude, France.

Father Jean-Pierre was a gifted spiritual director and a superb preacher. In 1645, he was assigned to preach parish missions. It was during these missionary tours that he encountered several young single women and widows who confided in him their desire to consecrate their lives to God and the service of the people in need while living in the world. In Le Puy-en-Velay, the Saint-Joseph hospice for orphans and widows was under the authority of Bishop Henri de Maupas. He had been a friend of Saints Vincent de Paul and Francis de Sales. Both of them had founded congregations of women engaging in apostolic works outside the cloister (a requirement for women religious at the time). Fr. Jean-Pierre approached the Bishop with a design for women who wished to combine holiness of life with apostolic activity, and the Bishop responded favourably. Fr. Jean-Pierre founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Le Puy, France, a congregation of nuns who should give themselves up wholly and unreservedly to all the spiritual and corporal works of mercy.

Origin and activism Alexis Wright is a land rights activist originally from the Waanyi people in the highlands of the southern Gulf of Carpentaria. Wright's father, a white cattleman, died when she was five years old and she grew up in Cloncurry, Queensland, with her mother and grandmother. When the Northern Territory Intervention proposed by the Howard Government in mid-2007 was introduced, Wright delivered a high-profile 10,000-word speech, sponsored by International PEN, in which her identification of an ethos of national fear in Australia came to be portrayed in the national media as a characterisation of the feelings of Indigenous peoples associated with the Intervention. Literary career Alexis Wright's first book, the novel Plains of Promise, published in 1997, was nominated for several literary awards and has been reprinted several times by University of Queensland Press. Wright is also the author of non-fiction works: Take Power, on the history of the land rights movement, was published in 1998, and Grog War (Magabala Books) on the introduction of alcohol restrictions in Tennant Creek, published in 1997. Her second novel, Carpentaria, took two years to conceive and more than six years to write. It was rejected by every major publisher in Australia before independent publisher Giramondo published it in 2006. Since then it has won the Miles Franklin Award in June 2007, the 2007 Fiction Book award in the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards, the 2007 ALS Gold Medal and the 2007 Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction. Wright was a 2012 attendee of the Byron Bay Writers Festival and Singapore Writers Festival.\\"Continuing with this week's SWF Sneaks\\", Singapore Writers Festival, 9 July 2012. Wright's most recent book, Tracker, her tribute to the central Australian economist Tracker Tilmouth, was published by Giramondo in 2017. A biographical work variously characterized as unconventional and complicated, Tracker won the 2018 Stella Prize. In the words of Ben Etherington: \\"It is a work, epic in scope and size, that will ensure that a legend of Central Australian politics is preserved in myth.\\" She was awarded the 2018 Magarey Medal for Biography for Tracker. Tracker also won the 2018 University of Queensland Non-Fiction Book Award at the Queensland Literary Awards. and was shortlisted for the NSW Premier's Literary Awards, Douglas Stewart Prize for No-Fiction 2019. Wright was on the program for four events at the 2017 Brisbane Writers Festival in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In 2018, Wright conducted another storytelling collaboration, this time with the Gangalidda leader and activist Clarence Walden in Doomadgee, Northern Queensland. Her work with Walden led to two feature documentaries, Nothing but the Truth, a radio feature that broadcast on the Awaye! program on ABC Radio National in June 2019, and Straight from the Heart, a screen documentary that premiered at World Literature and the Global South in August 2019. Academic career Wright is a Distinguished Research Fellow at Western Sydney University. Wright is currently a member of the Australian Research Council research project \\"Other Worlds: Forms of World Literature\\".\\"Forms of World Literature\\", Other Worlds. Building on her success with Tracker, her theme for the project focuses on forms of Aboriginal oral storytelling. In 2017, Wright was named the Boisbouvier Chair in Australian Literature at the University of Melbourne.  Bibliography  Novels * Plains of Promise (University of Queensland Press, 1997).

History Jaral del Progreso was created as a congregation named \\"Jaral de la Cruz\\". Later the name was changed to \\"Jaral del Valle\\". The main reason for this was that it belonged to a place called Camembaro, now known as Valle de Santiago. These lands were consignated to the Indian Diego Turicant√≠ in 1590 by the viceroy Luis de Velasco. On June 9, 1831 the limits of the land were marked by Don Anzelmo Ramirez, but until September 1863 this land was considered a municipality of the state of Guanajuato. The governor was the General Manuel Doblado. The name Jaral del Valle stayed until 1910 when it was considered a town, so they changed the name to Jaral del Progreso. By 1912 the State declared Jaral del Progreso a free town. There was also an expansion of their limits up to Zempoala. Culture and tourism In Jaral del Progreso monuments can be found throughout the town. Most of them are busts located in the municipal seat. One of them is of Benito Juarez, a Mexican president. His bust is located in the municipal garden. Other busts are of historic heroes like Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, father of the country. There is also a monument that represents the Mexican War of Independence. On special dates the people in Jaral del Progreso celebrate with festivities, festivals and other events. The most important are May 3, day of the holy cross; May 15, a religious party in honor of Saint Isidro who helps the peasants; and September 10, day of the saint of the town, Saint Nicolas. Food includes desserts such as a roll made with fruit such as guayaba and pirulis and baked fruit. One can also find obleas de queso.

Although no official scientific weather station has ever been established in the area it is known to be extremely wet and has been claimed to be one of the wettest places on earth with a rainfall in excess of 10m a year. The villagers are known to have patches of land for growing vegetables. Transport Olosbip is a highly inaccessible settlement. Although located along the Upper Fly River, it is not easily accessible by river and is not connected by road. The small airstrip, Olsobip Airport, was built in 1964/5 by local labourers.

The addition of the Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation to the Benedum Hall Michael L. Benedum Hall of Engineering is a landmark academic building on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The building was designed in the brutalist style by the architectural firm of Deeter, Ritchey, and Sippel and completed in 1971 at a cost of $15 million ($ million today). The building was honored with both the Pennsylvania Society American Institute of Architects Honor Award and Distinguished Building Award. It was built with a gift from the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation and funds from the General State Authority. It stands on a site that was formerly occupied by the National Guard's Logan Armory. It is fifteen stories (two below ground) and has of space. It is home to the Swanson School of Engineering and contains classrooms, laboratories, offices, conference and seminar rooms, and is home to the George M. Bevier Engineering Library which serves not only the engineering school, but also the Department of Physics and Astronomy and Department of Geology and Planetary Science. The wall panel behind the circulation desk of the library features a mural carved by Edward Catich. Benedum Hall also includes a computer lab and an Einstein's Express. A $60 million Benedum Hall renovation and expansion project was launched in 2008. A new addition, a $16 million, LEED designed structure for the Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation, now connects what was previously the Engineering Auditorium to the second and third floor of the main tower across the previous existing plaza. Originally an essentially separate building only connected by the ground, basement, and sub-basement levels, the auditorium was reconfigured from its original 528-seat space into five separate classrooms. The Mascaro Center moved into its new accommodations in August 2009. In 2012, the Mascaro Center addition to Benedum Hall won the International Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute Design Award in the Educational Facility Category. In addition, the library, computer lab, and club offices moved to the ground and basement levels, administrative offices shifted to the first floor, and other floors of the tower were renovated. A $39.9 million Phase II of renovations to the subbasement, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 8th floors, as well as the creation of a new mezzanine level, was approved in November, 2010. Renovations creating an energy innovation floor on floor eight were completed in 2013. Former President, CIA Director, and Ambassador George H.W.

Biography Marin Soljaƒçiƒá was born in Zagreb in 1974. After graduating from XV Gymnasium (MIOC) in Zagreb he attended MIT, where he got his BSc in physics and electrical engineering in 1996.MIT home page In 1998 he got his MSc from Princeton University and in 2000 he got his PhD in Physics. In 2005 he became a professor of Physics at MIT. In 2008, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. Work In 2007 Marin Soljaƒçiƒá and his assistants successfully made the first efficient non-radiative power transfer at a distance of 2 meters turning on a 60 W light bulb. Energy transfer was 40% efficient. Professor Soljaƒçiƒá's experiments and work in wireless energy transfer are related in spirit to the work of Nikola Tesla in the early 20th century, but also have significant differences: unlike Tesla's long-range wireless energy transfer in Colorado, the Soljaƒçiƒá group focuses only on short-range transfer, and unlike Tesla coils which resonantly transfer power with electric fields (which couple strongly to surrounding matter, most famously inducing artificial lightning) the Soljaƒçiƒá proposal uses coupling primarily via magnetic fields. This work is currently being pursued in Soljaƒçiƒá's WiTricity company. Soljaƒçiƒá believes that low-power commercial application of this technology, such as charging of mobile phones, is several years away. In addition to wireless energy transfer, Prof. Soljaƒçiƒá works on numerous problems on electromagnetism https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0406/0406001.pdf in materials structured on the scale of the wavelength, such as micro- and nano-structured materials for infrared and visible light, including nonlinear optical devices and surface plasmons.

It was named after the pioneering electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. As Nvidia's first microarchitecture to implement unified shaders, it was used with GeForce 8 Series, GeForce 9 Series, GeForce 100 Series, GeForce 200 Series, and GeForce 300 Series of GPUs collectively manufactured in 90 nm, 80 nm, 65 nm, 55 nm, and 40 nm. It was also in the GeForce 405 and in the Quadro FX, Quadro x000, Quadro NVS series, and Nvidia Tesla computing modules. Tesla replaced the old fixed-pipeline microarchitectures, represented at the time of introduction by the GeForce 7 series. It competed directly with AMD's first unified shader microarchitecture named TeraScale, a development of ATI's work on the Xbox 360 which used a similar design. Tesla was followed by Fermi.  Overview  Tesla is Nvidia's first microarchitecture implementing the unified shader model. The driver supports Direct3D 10 Shader Model 4.0 / OpenGL 2.1 (later drivers have OpenGL 3.3 support) architecture. The design is a major shift for NVIDIA in GPU functionality and capability, the most obvious change being the move from the separate functional units (pixel shaders, vertex shaders) within previous GPUs to a homogeneous collection of universal floating point processors (called \\"stream processors\\") that can perform a more universal set of tasks. GPU NVIDIA G80 GeForce 8's unified shader architecture consists of a number of stream processors (SPs). Unlike the vector processing approach taken with older shader units, each SP is scalar and thus can operate only on one component at a time. This makes them less complex to build while still being quite flexible and universal. Scalar shader units also have the advantage of being more efficient in a number of cases as compared to previous generation vector shader units that rely on ideal instruction mixture and ordering to reach peak throughput. The lower maximum throughput of these scalar processors is compensated for by efficiency and by running them at a high clock speed (made possible by their simplicity). GeForce 8 runs the various parts of its core at differing clock speeds (clock domains), similar to the operation of the previous GeForce 7 Series GPUs. For example, the stream processors of GeForce 8800 GTX operate at a 1.35 GHz clock rate while the rest of the chip is operating at 575 MHz.Wasson, Scott. NVIDIA's GeForce 8800 graphics processor , Tech Report, 8 November 2007. GeForce 8 performs significantly better texture filtering than its predecessors that used various optimizations and visual tricks to speed up rendering without impairing filtering quality. The GeForce 8 line correctly renders an angle-independent anisotropic filtering algorithm along with full trilinear texture filtering. G80, though not its smaller brethren, is equipped with much more texture filtering arithmetic ability than the GeForce 7 series. This allows high-quality filtering with a much smaller performance hit than previously. NVIDIA has also introduced new polygon edge anti-aliasing methods, including the ability of the GPU's ROPs to perform both Multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) and HDR lighting at the same time, correcting various limitations of previous generations. GeForce 8 can perform MSAA with both FP16 and FP32 texture formats. GeForce 8 supports 128-bit HDR rendering, an increase from prior cards' 64-bit support. The chip's new anti-aliasing technology, called coverage sampling AA (CSAA), uses Z, color, and coverage information to determine final pixel color. This technique of color optimization allows 16X CSAA to look crisp and sharp.Sommefeldt, Rys.NVIDIA G80: Image Quality Analysis, Beyond3D, 12 December 2006.  Performance  The claimed theoretical single-precision processing power for Tesla-based cards given in FLOPS may be hard to reach in real-world workloads. In G80/G90/GT200, each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) contains 8 Shader Processors (SP, or Unified Shader, or CUDA Core) and 2 Special Function Units (SFU). Each SP can fulfill up to two single-precision operations per clock: 1 Multiply and 1 Add, using a single MAD instruction. Each SFU can fulfill up to four operations per clock: four MUL (Multiply) instructions. So one SM as a whole can execute 8 MADs (16 operations) and 8 MULs (8 operations) per clock, or 24 operations per clock, which is (relatively speaking) 3 times the number of SPs. Therefore, to calculate the theoretical dual-issue MAD+MUL performance in floating point operations per second [FLOPSsp+sfu, GFLOPS] of a graphics card with SP count [n] and shader frequency [f, GHz], the formula is: FLOPSsp+sfu = 3 √ó n √ó f. However leveraging dual-issue performance like MAD+MUL is problematic: * Dual- issuing the MUL is not available in graphics mode on G80/G90,Sommefeldt, Rys. NVIDIA G80: Architecture and GPU Analysis - Page 11, Beyond3D, 8 November 2006 though it was much improved in GT200. * Not all combinations of instructions like MAD+MUL can be executed in parallel on the SP and SFU, because the SFU is rather specialized as it can only handle a specific subset of instructions: 32-bit floating point multiplication, transcendental functions, interpolation for parameter blending, reciprocal, reciprocal square root, sine, cosine, etc. * The SFU could become busy for many cycles when executing these instructions, in which case it is unavailable for dual-issuing MUL instructions. For these reasons, in order to estimate the performance of real-world workloads, it may be more helpful to ignore the SFU and to assume only 1 MAD (2 operations) per SP per cycle. In this case the formula to calculate the theoretical performance in floating point operations per second becomes: FLOPSsp = 2 √ó n √ó f. The theoretical double-precision processing power of a Tesla GPU is 1/8 of the single precision performance on GT200; there is no double precision support on G8x and G9x.

It is a short millipede, rounded in cross-section, which is capable of rolling itself up into a ball (\\"volvation\\") when disturbed. This behaviour is also found in the pill woodlouse Armadillidium, with which G. marginata is often confused. Distribution Glomeris marginata is found throughout central and north- western Europe, from Poland and Scandinavia to Spain and Italy. In the British Isles, it is found in all areas south of the Central Belt of Scotland. Description The underside of G. marginata ‚Äì note the two pairs of legs per body segment Glomeris marginata grows up to long and wide, and is covered by twelve black dorsal plates with white rims. Each segment except those at the front and back bears two pairs of legs, with around 18 pairs in total. This distinguishes pill millipedes from pill woodlice, both of which are called \\"pillbugs\\" ‚Äî woodlice have 7 pairs of walking legs, one per body segment, while millipedes have more pairs, and with two pairs to each apparent body segment. When rolled into a ball, G. marginata can be distinguished from a rolled‚Äìup pill woodlouse by the asymmetrical ball it rolls into; pill woodlice roll into much more perfect spheres. The cuticle is also darker and shinier, and the antennae are shorter. The head and tail of a woodlouse have a greater number of small plates, while the head of Glomeris is protected by a single large shield, and it lacks the uropods of woodlice at the read end. Although usually black, red, yellow and brown individuals do occasionally occur. Ecology G. marginata just beginning to unroll from its defensive posture Glomeris marginata lives in leaf litter as well as in grass and under stones, with a preference for calcareous soils. In domestic gardens, they are most frequent along hedgerows and at the bases of old walls, where the mortar has started to crumble, leaching lime into the soil. It is less prone to desiccation than other millipedes and can be found in the open, even in sunny weather, although they are more active at night and prefer more humid areas. G. marginata feeds on old, rotting leaves, despite the higher nutrient content of freshly‚Äìfallen leaves, and G. marginata can be responsible for recycling a significant proportion of the nutrients in the leaf litter. Predators of Glomeris marginata are reported to include the starling, the common toad, the woodlouse spider, and hedgehogs. As well as rolling up into a ball for protection, G. marginata produces noxious chemicals to ward off potential predators, as many millipedes do. One to eight drops of a viscid fluid are secreted, containing the quinazolinone alkaloids glomerin and homoglomerin, dissolved in a watery protein matrix. These chemicals act as antifeedants and toxins to spiders, insects and vertebrates, and the fluid is sticky enough to entrap the legs of ants. Having completely discharged these chemical defences, it can take up to four months for the millipede to replenish their supplies. Reproduction and life cycle Breeding takes place cyclically in spring and summer. Male G. marginata are capable of producing a pheromone which attracts females, although this is only believed to be effective over short distances. They then transfer sperm to the female using their gonopods, specially modified legs. After fertilisation, the females lay 70‚Äì80 eggs, each about 1 mm long, and each wrapped singly in a capsule of digested earth. The eggs hatch after a period of about two months, with the duration depending on factors including temperature. Development lasts for up to three years, and involves nine moults, following which moults occur periodically as adults. Females are fertile for several years, and can produce six broods over their lifetime, which can be up to eleven years.

The vehicle was the result of a joint venture between Ford and National Coach Works, located in Los Angeles, California. While not officially a production vehicle or a replacement for the Ford Ranchero (which ended production after the 1979 model year), the Durango was designed as a potential competitor to the newly downsized Chevrolet El Camino and was commissioned by Ford to be sold through Ford dealerships. As no official totals were kept by either company production estimates vary between the low 200s and 350, with 212 conversions known to have been made by National Coach Works. Design overview = Production = To produce the Durango, National Coach Works used the body of the Ford Fairmont Futura two-door coupe. Aft of the B-pillar, the roof was removed along with the trunklid and rear seating area. Behind the rear seats, the company added a flat-floor fiberglass cargo bed along with a bulkhead and new rear window behind the two front seats. The rear fascia above the bumper was redesigned into a fold-down tailgate. As the tailgate included the license plate and taillamps, the Durango was produced with a disclaimer warning drivers from driving with the tailgate in the down position. The Pickup, Van and 4WD magazine from December 1981 features an article about the Durango that states: \\"The project had been planned for an earlier date in 1981 than that which was finally achieved, so only a little over 100 units were assembled before the current-year model went out of production.\\" = Features = Ford Durango tailgate detail, showing filler panel and integrated taillamps As the B-pillar design of the Fairmont Futura coupe lent itself to the conversion on an unofficial basis, there are several unique features to the Durango that identify it as a vehicle converted by National Coach. With the exception of a prototype based upon a 1979 Mercury Z-7, all examples were based upon the Fairmont Futura. Conversions by National Coach, which are the only versions with a functioning tailgate, feature a fiberglass filler panel between the cargo bed and the tailgate; the design of the panel stores the tailgate hinges when it is folded down. As equipped from the factory, the Ford Durango was equipped only with a 200 cubic-inch inline six, the mid-range engine of the Fairmont line. The engine was paired with a three-speed automatic transmission.

Le Coz was born at Plou√©vez-Parzay, Finist√®re. He was pupil, then professor, and finally principal of the Coll√®ge de Quimper. He took the constitutional oath in 1791, was elected constitutional bishop of Ille-et-Vilaine, and wrote in defence of his election ‚Äî declared null and void by the pope ‚Äî \\"Accord des vrais principes de la morale et de la raison sur la Constitution civile du clerg√©\\". Elected to the Legislative Assembly, he showed courage and ability in defending against the majority Catholic colleges, the ecclesiastical costume, and even Christian marriage. His moderation drew upon him the severity of the Convention, and he spent fourteen months in the prison of Mont-Saint-Michel. Later, under the Directory, the vigour with which he opposed the substitution of the decadi for the Christian Sunday came near causing his deportation. Under the Concordat of 1802, Le Coz was one of the Constitutional bishops whom the force of circumstances compelled the Holy See to recognize, and he became Archbishop of Besan√ßon. Bernier, the ecclesiastical diplomat who negotiated the rehabilitation of the jurors, thought it best, in order to avoid delay, not to make a clear mention of the manner of retractation required by Pope Pius VII; as a consequence, Le Coz denied ever having retracted, and the awkwardness of the situation was ended only by a personal interview between Le Coz and Pius VII, in which both were seen weeping but of which neither ever spoke. As schismatic Bishop of Ille-et-Vilaine, Le Coz failed in his endeavour to organize the new province of which he was the metropolitan; otherwise he proved a zealous administrator and a charitable pastor. The strange mixture in Le Coz's life, is partly explained by his intensely Gallican education, which caused him to adopt and to maintain with obstinacy schismatic views. His Gallicanism, which made him so haughty toward the pope, found him almost cringing before the various political regimes which succeeded one another during his episcopate. Le Coz, even against the all-powerful Abb√© Gr√©goire, defended the cause of religion in the Annales de la Religion, in which he was a collaborator, and in his ', part of which has been published.

Over thirty radicals were arrested; three were tried for high treason: Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall. In a repudiation of the government's policies, they were acquitted by three separate juries in November 1794 to public rejoicing. The treason trials were an extension of the sedition trials of 1792 and 1793 against parliamentary reformers in both England and Scotland. Historical context The historical backdrop to the Treason Trials is complex; it involves not only the British parliamentary reform efforts of the 1770s and 1780s but also the French Revolution. In the 1770s and 1780s, there was an effort among liberal-minded Members of Parliament to reform the British electoral system. A disproportionately small number of electors voted for MPs and many seats were bought. Christopher Wyvill and William Pitt the Younger argued for additional seats to be added to the House of Commons and the Duke of Richmond and John Cartwright advocated a more radical reform: \\"the payment of MPs, an end to corruption and patronage in parliamentary elections, annual parliaments (partly to enable the speedy removal of corrupt MPs) and, preeminently and most controversially, universal manhood suffrage\\".Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", x. Both efforts failed and the reform movement appeared moribund in the mid-1780s. Once the revolution in France began to demonstrate the power of popular agitation, the British reform movement was reinvigorated. Much of the vigorous political debate in the 1790s in Britain was sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). Surprising his friends and enemies alike, Burke, who had supported the American Revolution, criticized the French Revolution and the British radicals who had welcomed its early stages. While the radicals saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were challenged, the result would be endless anarchy. There was an immediate response from the British supporters of the French revolution, most notably Mary Wollstonecraft in her Vindication of the Rights of Men and Thomas Paine in his Rights of Man. In this lively pamphlet war, now referred to as the \\"Revolution Controversy\\", British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state.Butler, \\"Introductory Essay\\"; Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xi‚Äìxii. 1792 was the \\"annus mirabilis of eighteenth-century radicalism\\": its most important texts, such as Rights of Man, were published and the influence of the radical associations was at its height. In fact, it was as a result of the publication of the Rights of Man that such associations began to proliferate.Butler, \\"Introductory essay,\\" 7; see also Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xii. The most significant groups, made up of artisans, merchants and others from the middling and lower sorts, were the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information, the London Corresponding Society (LCS) and the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI).Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xii. But it was not until these groups formed an alliance with the more genteel Society of the Friends of the People that the government became concerned. When this sympathy became known, the government issued a royal proclamation against seditious writings on 21 May 1792. In a dramatic increase compared to the rest of the century, there were over 100 prosecutions for sedition in the 1790s alone.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xiii. The British government, fearing an uprising similar to the French Revolution, took even more drastic steps to quash the radicals. They made an increasing number of political arrests and infiltrated the radical groups; they threatened to \\"revoke the licences of publicans who continued to host politicized debating societies and to carry reformist literature\\"; they seized the mail of \\"suspected dissidents\\"; and they supported groups that disrupted radical events and attacked radicals in the press.Keen, 54. Additionally, the British Government initiated the Aliens Act of 1793 in order to regulate the entrance of immigrants into Great Britain. Essentially, the Aliens Act enforced that aliens be recorded upon arrival and register with the local justice of the peace. Specifically, immigrants were required to give their names, ranks, occupations, and addresses. Overall, the Aliens Act reduced the number of immigrants into Great Britain out of fear that one of them may be an unwanted spy. Radicals saw this period as \\"the institution of a system of terror, almost as hideous in its features, almost as gigantic in its stature, and infinitely more pernicious in its tendency, than France ever knew\\".Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxi. Prelude: Trials of Thomas Paine, John Frost and Daniel Isaac Eaton =Thomas Paine= Thomas Paine; a painting by Auguste Milli√®re (1880), after an engraving by William Sharp after a portrait by George Romney (1792) The administration did not immediately begin to prosecute all of its detractors after the proclamation against seditious writings was issued. Although Paine's publisher, J. S. Jordan, was indicted for sedition for publishing the Rights of Man in May 1792, Paine himself was not charged until the royal proclamation was promulgated. Even then, the government did not actively pursue him, apart from spying on him and continuing its propaganda campaign against \\"Mad Tom\\". Paine's trial was delayed until December and he fled to France in the intervening months, apparently with the government's blessing, which was more interested in getting rid of such a troublesome citizen than trying him in person. Moreover, afraid that Paine might use his trial as a political platform, the government may not have wanted to prosecute Paine personally.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xviii. When the trial took place on 18 December 1792, its outcome was a foregone conclusion. The government, under Pitt's direction, had been lambasting Paine in the papers for months and the trial judge had negotiated the prosecution's arguments with them ahead of time. The radical Thomas Erskine defended Paine by arguing that his pamphlet was part of an honorable English tradition of political philosophy that included the writings of John Milton, John Locke and David Hume; he also pointed out that Paine was responding to the philosophical work of an MP, Burke. The Attorney-General argued that the pamphlet was aimed at readers \\"whose minds cannot be supposed to be conversant with subjects of this sort\\" and cited its cheap price as evidence of its lack of serious intent.Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xix. The prosecution did not even have to rebut Erskine's arguments; the jury informed the judge they had already decided Paine was guilty.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xix. =John Frost= John Frost was a member of the SCI, a former associate of Pitt, an attorney and a friend of Paine's. On 6 November 1792 he got involved in a dispute with a friend over the French revolution in a tavern and was heard to say \\"Equality, and No King\\". This dispute was reported by publicans to government informers. When Frost went to Paris later that month, the government declared him an outlaw and encouraged him to stay in France. Frost, challenging the government to act, returned and surrendered himself to the authorities. Suggestions began to float around, from government and radical sources alike, that the government was embarrassed to prosecute Frost because of his former friendship with Pitt. But on 27 May, he was brought to trial for sedition. Erskine defended Frost, arguing that there was no seditious intent to his statement, his client was drunk, he was in a heated argument, and he was in a private space (the tavern). The Attorney-General contended that Frost \\"was a man whose seditious intent was carried with him wherever he went\\".Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xx. The jury convicted him. =Daniel Isaac Eaton= Daniel Isaac Eaton, the publisher of the popular periodical Politics for the People, was arrested on 7 December 1793 for publishing a statement by John Thelwall, a radical lecturer and debater. Thelwall had made a speech that included an anecdote about a tyrannical gamecock named \\"King Chanticleer\\" who was beheaded for its despotism and Eaton reprinted it. Eaton was imprisoned for three months before his trial in an effort to bankrupt him and his family. In February 1794, he was brought to trial and defended by John Gurney. Gurney argued that the comment was an indictment of tyranny in general or of Louis XVI, the king of France, and announced his dismay that anyone could think that the author meant George III. \\"Gurney went so far as to cheekily suggest that it was the Attorney-General who was guilty of seditious libel; by supplying those innuendos he, not Eaton or Thelwall, had represented George III as a tyrant.\\"Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xx‚Äìxxii. Everyone laughed uproariously and Eaton was acquitted; the membership of the radical societies rocketed. Treason Trials of 1794 John Horne Tooke The radical societies were briefly enjoying an upsurge in membership and influence. In the summer of 1793 several of them decided to convene in Edinburgh to decide on how to summon \\"a great Body of the People\\" to convince Parliament to reform, since it did not seem willing to reform itself. The government viewed this assembly as an attempt to set up an anti-parliament. In Scotland, three leaders of the convention were tried for sedition and sentenced to fourteen years of service in Botany Bay. Such harsh sentences shocked the nation and while initially the societies believed that an insurrection might be necessary to resist such an overbearing government, their rhetoric never materialized into an actual armed rebellion.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxiv‚Äìxxv. Plans were made by some of the societies to meet again if the government became more hostile (e.g. if they suspended habeas corpus). In 1794, a plan was circulated to convene again, but it never got off the ground. The government, frightened however, arrested six members of the SCI and 13 members of the LCS on suspicion of \\"treasonable practices\\" in conspiring to assume \\"a pretended general convention of the people, in contempt and defiance of the authority of parliament, and on principles subversive of the existing laws and constitution, and directly tending to the introduction of that system of anarchy and confusion which has fatally prevailed in France\\".Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxvii. Over thirty men were arrested in all. Of the people arrested were Thomas Hardy, secretary of the LCS; the linguist John Horne Tooke; the novelist and dramatist Thomas Holcroft (arrested in October); the Unitarian minister Jeremiah Joyce; writer and lecturer John Thelwall; bookseller and pamphleteer Thomas Spence; and silversmith and, later, historian John Baxter.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxvii. After the arrests, the government formed two secret committees to study the papers they had seized from the radicals' houses. After the first committee report, the government introduced a bill in the House of Commons to suspend habeas corpus; thus, those arrested on suspicion of treason could be held without bail or charge until February 1795. In June 1794 the committee issued a second report, asserting that the radical societies had been planning at least to \\"over-awe\\" the sovereign and Parliament by the show of \\"a great Body of the People\\" if not to overthrow the government and install a French-style republic. They claimed that the societies had attempted to assemble a large armoury for this purpose, but no evidence could be found for it.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxviii. They were charged with an assortment of crimes, but seditious libel and treason were the most serious. The government propagated the notion that the radicals had committed a new kind of treason, what they called \\"modern\\" or \\"French\\" treason. While previous defendants had tried to replace one king with another from another dynasty, these democrats wanted to overthrow the entire monarchical system and remove the king entirely. \\"Modern French treason, it seemed, was different from, was worse than, old-fashioned English treason.\\"Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxi. The treason statute, that of the Act of Edward III from 1351, did not apply well to this new kind of treason. The Attorney-General Sir John Scott, who would prosecute Hardy and Horne Tooke, \\"decided to base the indictment on the charge that the societies had been engaged in a conspiracy to levy war against the king, that they intended to subvert the constitution, to depose the King, and put him to death; and for that purpose, and with Force and Arms, they conspired to excite insurrection and rebellion\\" (emphasis in original). Initially the men were confined to the Tower of London, but they were moved to Newgate prison. Those charged with treason faced the brutal punishment of hanging, drawing and quartering if convicted: each would have been \\"hanged by the neck, cut down while still alive, disembowelled (and his entrails burned before his face) and then beheaded and quartered\\".Thompson, 19. The entire radical movement was also on trial; there were supposedly 800 warrants that were ready to be acted upon when the government won its case.Thompson, 137. =Thomas Hardy= Hardy's trial was first; his wife had died while he was in prison, generating support for him among the populace.Thompson, 135. Thomas Erskine, defending again, argued that the radicals had proposed nothing more than the Duke of Richmond (now an anti-reformer) had in the 1780s and \\"their plan for a convention of delegates was borrowed from a similar plan advanced by Pitt himself\\".Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxi‚Äìxxxii. The government could provide no real evidence of an armed insurrection. The Attorney-General's opening statement lasted nine hours, leading the former Lord Chancellor Lord Thurlow to comment that \\"there was no treason\\".Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxii. Treason must be \\"clear and obvious\\"; the great legal theorist Edward Coke had argued that treason was to be determined \\"not upon conjecturall presumptions, or inferences, or strains of wit, but upon good and sufficient proof\\". Part of Erskine's effective defence was to dismiss the prosecution's case, as it was based on \\"strains of wit\\" or \\"imagination\\" (a play on words of the statute itself).Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxii. He claimed, as he had in the earlier trials, that it was the prosecution that was \\"imagining the king's death\\" rather than the defence. His cross- examination of the prosecution's spies also helped demolish their case; he \\"cross-examined these witnesses in a tone of contemptuous disbelief and managed to discredit much of their evidence\\".Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxiv; Thompson, 135. After a nine-day trial, which was exceptionally long for the time, he was acquitted.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxiv. The foreman of the jury fainted after delivering his verdict of not guilty, and the crowd enthusiastically carried Hardy through the streets of London. In his speeches, Erskine emphasized that the radical organizations, primarily the London Corresponding Society and the Society for Constitutional Information, were dedicated to a revolution of ideas, not a violent revolution‚Äîthey embodied the new ideals of the Enlightenment.Keen 164‚Äì165. Erskine was helped in his defence by pamphlets such as William Godwin's Cursory Strictures on the Charge Delivered by Lord Chief Justice Eyre to the Grand Jury, 2 October 1794.Butler, \\"Introductory essay\\", 198‚Äì199. Bell's transcript of the trials =John Horne Tooke= John Horne Tooke's trial followed Hardy's, in which Pitt was forced to testify and admit that he had attended radical meetings himself.Thompson, 136. Throughout the trial Horne Tooke \\"combined the affectation of boredom with irreverent wit\\". One observer noted that when asked by the court if he would be tried \\"by God and his Country\\", he \\"eyed the court for some seconds with an air of significancy few men are so well able to assume, and shaking his head, emphatically answered 'I would be tried by God and my country, but‚Äî!Qtd. in Thompson, 135. After a long trial, he too was acquitted. All of the other members of the SCI were released after these two trials, as it became obvious to the government that they would not gain any convictions. =John Thelwall= John Thelwall was tried last; the government felt forced to try him because the loyalist press had argued that his case was particularly strong. While awaiting trial, he wrote and published poetry indicting the entire process. During Thelwall's trial, various members of the London Corresponding Society testified that Thelwall and the others had no concrete plans to overthrow the government, and that details of how reform was to be achieved were an \\"afterthought\\". This undermined the prosecution's claims that the society was responsible for fomenting rebellion. Thelwall was also acquitted, after which the rest of the cases were dismissed.Thompson, 19; Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxiv. Trial literature All of these trials, both those from 1792 and those from 1794, were published as part of an 18th-century genre called \\"trial literature\\". Often, multiple versions of famous trials would be published and since the shorthand takers were not always precise, the accounts disagree. Moreover, the accounts were sometimes altered by one side or another. Importantly, those in the courtroom knew that their words would be published. In Scotland, one of the accused ringleaders of the plot said: \\"What I say this day will not be confined within these walls, but will spread far and wide.\\"Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxviii. Indeed, the government may have resisted trying Paine until he had left the country because of the notorious power of his pen.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxviii. Aftermath James Gillray's cartoon of Thelwall speaking at Copenhagen Fields on 26 October 1795 Although all of the defendants of the Treason Trials had been acquitted, the administration and the loyalists assumed they were guilty. Secretary at War William Windham referred to the radicals as \\"acquitted felon[s]\\" and William Pitt and the Attorney-General called them \\"morally guilty\\".Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxv. There was widespread agreement that they got off because the treason statute was outdated. When, in October 1795, crowds threw refuse at the king and insulted him, demanding a cessation of the war with France and lower bread prices, Parliament passed the \\"gagging acts\\" (the Seditious Meetings Act and the Treasonable Practices Act, also known as the \\"Two Acts\\"). Under these new laws, it was almost impossible to have a public meeting and speech at such meetings was severely curtailed.Butler, Romantics, 49; Thompson, 19; Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxv; Keen, 54. As a result of these legislative acts, societies that were not directly involved with the Treason Trials, like the Society of the Friends of the People, disbanded.Iain Hampsher-Monk. \\"Civic Humanism and Parliamentary Reform: The Case of the Society of the Friends of the People.\\" (Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 70‚Äì89). Journal of British Studies, 1979. . 24 November 2015. British \\"radicalism encountered a severe set-back\\" during these years, and it was not until a generation later that any real reform could be enacted.Butler, \\"Introductory essay,\\" 3. The trials, although they were not government victories, served the purpose for which they were intended‚Äîall of these men, except Thelwall, withdrew from active radical politics as did many others fearful of governmental retribution.

Merrie Melodies animated cartoon directed by Rudolf Ising. The short was released on November 28, 1931, and stars Piggy. The minimal storyline centers on the plucky Piggy's efforts to rescue his girlfriend and a doglike Uncle Tom from perilous predicaments and villains. The short's use of the racial epithet \\"Uncle Tom\\" prompted United Artists to withhold it from syndication in 1968, making it one of the infamous Censored Eleven. Summary Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land Comparison of steamboat piloting scenes in Steamboat Willie (top) and Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land has a rudimentary plot, unlike most of the Merrie Melodies of the time, which barely have any plot at all.BBeck, Jerry, and Will Friedwald (1989). Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros. Cartoons. Owl Books. . Page 12. The cartoon stars the Mickey Mouse-esque Piggy, his girlfriend Fluffy, and a canine Uncle Tom.Cruz, Brian (2003). \\"Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land \\". Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: The Early Years. Toon Zone. Accessed 21 June 2007. The film opens with a singing steamboat dancing down a river. On the deck, three blackface caricatures play the song for which the short is named on the harmonica, banjo, and bones. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom drives Fluffy toward the boat by donkey cart. The scene shifts to Piggy the riverboat captain in a sequence reminiscent of Disney's 1928 film Steamboat Willie. Fluffy joins the frolicking steamboat passengers and reunites with her boyfriend, but during the revelry, Piggy falls overboard. The pig has a run in with an alligator, but he makes it back to the boat. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom's donkey bucks him into a cemetery. There, in a variation on a stock gag featuring a superstitious black man,Lindvall, Terry, and Ben Fraser (1998). \\"Darker Shades of Animation: African-American Images in Warner Bros. Cartoons\\".

Tom escapes to the middle of the river, but a shoddy boat leaves him stranded and drowning. Piggy saves the day but not before a vaudevillian villain kidnaps his porcine paramour. Piggy captures the villain on a passing mail hook, leaving the villain tortured over a buzz saw. This short marks the second and last appearance of the characters Piggy and Fluffy. Distribution Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land was released in theaters on November 28, 1931 by Warner Bros. The cartoon's copyright expired in 1959, making it go into public domain. However, the cartoon has been withheld from distribution since 1968. At that time, United Artists owned the rights to most Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah land and ten other cartoons were deemed to feature racist depictions of African Americans that were too integral to the films for simple cuts to make them palatable for modern audiences.Did Bugs Bunny appear in a racist cartoon during World War II?, The Straight Dope, February 5, 2002 The cartoon has never been released on laserdisc, home video, or DVD, not counting public domain home releases.

Biography He made his studies in the diocesan school and the seminary of the Diocese of Nancy, and was ordained priest in 1863. He was engaged successively as professor in the school (petit s√©minaire) of Pont-√†-Mousson, chaplain to the Dominicanesses at Nancy (1879), and parish priest of Saint-Martin at Pont-√†- Mousson (1890). Meanwhile, he had won the Degree of Doctor of Letters with a Latin and a French thesis, the latter being honoured with a prize from the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise for two years. On 3 January 1893, he was nominated to the Bishopric of Angers, was preconized on 19 January, and consecrated on 20 March. He succeeded Charles √âmile Freppel, one of the most remarkable bishops of his time, and set himself to maintain all his predecessor's good works. To these he added the work of facilitating the education of poor children destined for the priesthood. He inaugurated the same enterprise in the Diocese of Toulouse, to which he was transferred three years later (30 May 1896) by a formal order of Pope Leo XIII. In his new see he laboured, in accordance with the views of this pontiff, to rally Catholics to the French Government. With this aim he wrote the Devoir des catholiques, an episcopal charge which attracted wide attention and earned for him the pope's congratulations. In addition he was summoned to Rome to be a cardinal at the curia (19 June 1899). Having resigned the See of Toulouse (14 December 1899), his activities were thenceforward absorbed in the work of the Roman congregations and some secret diplomatic negotiations. Nevertheless, he found leisure to write on the Concordat of 1801 and the conclave of 1903. In 1907 he was admitted to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise with a discourse which attracted much notice. Death came to him unexpectedly next year in London, whither he had gone to assist at the Eucharistic Congress. Works Under a somewhat commonplace exterior he had an inquiring mind. His works include *\\"De Joannis abbatis Gorziensis vita\\" (Nancy 1878); *\\"L'Ancien R√©gime dans la Province de Lorraine et Barrois\\" (Paris, 1871; 3rd ed., 1907); *\\"Le Concordat de 1801\\" (Paris, 1903); *\\"Les derniers jours de Leon XIII et le conclave de 1903\\" (Paris, 1904). A new edition of his works began to appear in Paris, July, 1910.

History Polynesian Adventure Tours was founded in 1977 by Bob George and Don Brown, with a small fleet of vans. The founders sold the company in 1986, to Atak Management Corporation, owned by Japanese-American businessman, Shig Katayama. Don Brown left the company and Bob George remained as Director of Sales. The company's fleet was expanded with the addition of motorcoaches and minibuses on Oahu, and bases operating sightseeing vans on the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. On August 1996, the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawaii approved the sale of Gray Line Hawaii, Ltd.'s PUC-issued authority \\"to provide services as a common carrier by motor vehicle in the over-twenty-five passenger classifications on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai\\" to Polynesian Adventure Tours, Inc. This allowed Polyad to further expand its motorcoach and minibus fleet to the islands outside of Oahu. In October 2017, Poly Ad was acquired by Orange County, California based Transportation Charter Services (TCS) from Norwegian Cruise Lines.

His Casbah Recording Studio was a part of Orange County, California's new music scene in the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s. St. James' first album was as leader‚Äìfrontman‚Äìsongwriter of the progressive rock group French Lick. St James was a pioneer of techno pop and dance music, using Moog synthesizers, electronic effects, and tape loops. St. James lived in France for two years, studying Musique concr√®te with French composers. There he first used Revox A77 tape machines to create ambient electronic textures. Upon returning from France, St. James started the electronic pop group Q with Stacey Swain (Stacey Q), Dan Van Patten from Berlin and John Van Tongeren. Q released one single, \\"Playback\\", on Cocteau Records, which was co-owned by Bill Nelson of Bebop Deluxe fame. Q also released a self-titled EP on red vinyl in the US on M.A.O. Records in 1982. Q later became SSQ and signed with EMI America Records on the heels of St. James' recording the first Berlin album Pleasure Victim. EMI signed St. James to a six-record solo deal. The first single off St. James' solo album \\"Trans-Atlantic\\" was to be \\"The Girl Who Seduced the World\\", which David Bowie wanted for his album Let's Dance. However, EMI America closed its doors almost immediately after the release of the SSQ and Jon St. James albums. St. James continued to do TV and movie work. He and Swain regrouped as Stacey Q in 1984 and released \\"Two of Hearts\\", which became a worldwide pop hit on Atlantic Records. Career As a producer and engineer, St. James led several influential recording projects beginning in the 1980s, including records by punk bands The Vandals and Social Distortion, as well as the new wave band Berlin.\\"John St. James Bio,\\" L.A. Songwriter's Network website. Accessed Jan. 3, 2015. As a songwriter, guitarist, and producer, St. James helped to bring the talents of techno-pop diva Stacey Q, the dance-pop duo Bardeux, and the dance-pop artist Katalina to a wide audience. In addition, St. James has provided musical soundtracks for television and radio, including projects for TV's St. Elsewhere, Hill Street Blues, Malcolm in the Middle and Dawson's Creek, among others. St. James moved into artist management and had his first double platinum hit with Candyman's \\"Knockin' Boots\\" on Epic Records. St. James produced and managed the careers of several more Epic acts including the synthpop acts Anything Box and Red Flag. St. James often played guitar, synth, and programming for new talent. He also produced for Enigma/Restless Records and for a time had his own label Synthecide, named after the SSQ song. Early projects included sound-alike promos for Los Angeles radio station KMET, an album of electronic music with a space navigation theme, and a four-song EP featuring Stacey Swain. The Casbah attracted a variety of talent, including The Righteous Brothers keyboardist and session musician John Van Tongeren, Berlin drummer, synthesist and producer Dan Van Patten, Agent Orange, Minutemen, The Adolescents, rockabilly artists Rocky Burnette, Rip Masters, and Christian glam rockers Stryper. After the success of Stacey Q's Better Than Heaven album, St. James sold the Casbah to members of Social Distortion and opened the new Formula 1 studio in La Habra. F1, as the studio is known, has hosted a wide variety of acts, including Allan Holdsworth, Rusty Anderson, Los Angeles guitarist Dale Hauskins of the Swiss progressive rock band Flame Dream, The Vandals, Blink-182, Warren Fitzgerald, Josh Freese, Bleeding Through, Jon Anderson of Yes, No Doubt, and Tenacious D. St. James sold his F1 studio to Thump Records, a Lowrider magazine-financed record label, for which St. James produced many artists. Since then he built a new personal studio where he has continued to record, write, and produce. Recent clients include Kung Fu Records, The Warped Tour, The Used, Mike Ness, Warren Fitzgerald, and Jason Freese of Green Day. St. James continues to develop young talent, such as the singer, songwriter and producer Andy Carpenter.

Biography Perraud was born at Lyon, France. A brilliant student at the lyc√©es Henri IV and St Louis, he entered the √âcole Normale, where he was strongly influenced by Joseph Gratry. In 1850 he secured the fellowship of history and for two years he taught at the lyc√©e of Angers. In 1852 he abandoned teaching to become a priest. He returned to Paris where he joined the Oratory, which was then being reorganized by Gratry and Abb√© P√©t√©tot, cur√© of St Roch. On his ordination in 1855, after a sojourn at Rome, he was appointed professor of history and prefect of religion at the \\"petit seminaire\\" of St. L√¥ which had just been confided to the Oratory. At the same time he devoted himself to preaching, for which purpose he was recalled to Paris. In 1860 he visited Ireland, after which he wrote Contemporary Ireland (1862). In 1865 he defended a theological thesis at the Sorbonne, where in 1866 he became professor of ecclesiastical history and dealt brilliantly with the history of Protestantism. He was appointed (1870) by √âmile Ollivier, a member of the Committee of Higher Education. In 1870 he was a chaplain in Marshal MacMahon's army, and after the war preached at the churches of St Philippe du Roule and of St Augustine in Paris. Made Bishop of Autun in 1874 despite his liberal tendencies, he interested himself especially in working- men. After the catastrophe of Montceau les mines, in which 22 miners died, he preached the funeral sermon; he gave several Lenten courses in his cathedral and preached the funeral sermons of Cardinal Guibert, Cardinal Lavigerie, and Marshal MacMahon. Perraud was actively concerned in the improvement of clerical studies. In this connection his sermon (1879) on \\"the Church and light\\" caused a great sensation; after the Congress of Brussels (1894) he was named honorary president of the Society for the Encouragement of Higher Studies among the Clergy. Elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1882 to replace Henri Auguste Barbier, in 1885 he welcomed Victor Duruy and in 1889 delivered the discourse on the prizes of virtue. Having been superior-general of the Oratory from 1884, he resigned in 1901 in order not to sign the request for authorization of his congregation. He was created cardinal in petto, 16 Jan., 1893, the creation being published at the Consistory of 1895. At the conclave of 1903 he energetically opposed the movement of exclusion directed against Rampolla by Puczina, Archbishop of Cracow, in the name of the Austrian Government. Perraud's works consist of the √âtudes sur l'Irlande contemporaine (Paris, 1862); L'Oratoire de France au XVIIe si√®cle (1865); Paroles de l'heure pr√©sente (Words for the present time) (1872); Le Cardinal de Richelieu (1872); and a number of oratorical works.

Combinations of different materials can be spotted in a given area, allowing not only cellular capture, when a specific interaction exists, but also the triggering of a cellular response, change in phenotype, or detection of a response from the cell, such as a specific secreted factor.

Ur-Zababa is listed on the Sumerian King List as the second king of the 4th Dynasty of Kish. This text also records that Ur- Zababa had appointed Sargon of Akkad, later ruler of the Akkadian Empire, his cup-bearer.  Family  According to the King List, Ur-Zababa was a son of King Puzur-Suen. His mother is unknown.The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: Kaffka by Bonnie G. SmithLiteratur, Politik und Recht in Mesopotamien: Festschrift f√ºr Claus Wilcke His grandmother was the famous Queen Kubaba.  Sargon legend  The Sargon legend is a Sumerian text purporting to be Sargon's biography. In the text, Ur-Zababa is mentioned, who awakens after a dream. For unknown reasons, Ur-Zababa appoints Sargon as a cupbearer. Soon after this, Ur-Zababa invites Sargon to his chambers to discuss a dream of Sargon's, involving the favor of the goddess Inanna. Ur- Zababa was deeply frightened. In an attempt to kill him, Ur-Zababa sends an unwitting Sargon to deliver his bronze mirror to the E-sikil, where the chief smith, Belic-tikal, will receive it. Ur-Zababa instructed the smith to throw Sargon and the mirror into the statue molds upon arrival. However, on his way to the E-sikil the goddess Inanna instructs Sargon to not enter into the E-sikil, but only meet Belic-tikal at the gate of the E-sikil. This ruins Belic-tikal's chance to kill Sargon, and five to ten days later Sargon reappears in the courts of U-Zababa. When Sargon returns to Ur-Zababa, the king becomes frightened again, and decides to send Sargon to King Lugal-zage- si of Uruk with a message on a clay tablet asking him to slay Sargon.\\"The Sargon Legend.\\" The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature. Oxford University, 2006Cooper & Heimpel 1983: 67‚Äì82 Other sources The Weidner Chronicle (ABC 19) agrees with both the King List and the Sargon Legend in making Sargon the cupbearer to Ur-Zababa, mentioning him in a single line as ruling in between Kubaba (Kugbau) and Sargon. : Ur-Zababa ordered Sargon, his cupbearer, to change the wine libations of Esagila. It goes on to say that Sargon failed to comply fully with this order, and though he became king, he was eventually punished by the Sumerian deities for his improper observances.Weidner Chronicle Most copies of the King List give Ur-Zababa an unrealistic reign of 400 years, but one copy reading \\"six years\\" is held to be more plausible. It is known that Lugal-zaggesi of Uruk and Umma destroyed Kish toward the end of his reign, before himself being deposed by Sargon. It is often assumed that Sargon also played a role in Ur-Zababa's downfall, but the relevant texts are too fragmentary to be explicit. Ur-Zababa's successors in Kish as named on the king-list, beginning with Zimudar, seem to have been vassals of Sargon, and there is no evidence that they ever really exercised hegemony in Sumer.Kish at The History Files Notes External links *Sargon's Victory Stele attempts to justify his overthrow of Ur-Zababa, his rightful king.

It stars Shabana Azmi, Makrand Deshpande, Shweta Basu Prasad, Vijay Raj and Alaap Mazgaonkar. The film tells the story of a young girl in north India and her encounter with an alleged witch in an old mansion in the locality, believed by the locals to be haunted. It also explains the belief in witches and witchcraft across modern day India. The film was screened in the Critics' Week (Spotlight on India) section at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Life in Chunni's village is all peace and quiet, and great fun. She fools the villagers including her parents with her impersonation of her twin sister, Munni. In the village, there is a mansion that is said to be haunted and legend goes that a witch called Makdee (Shabana Azmi) resides there. The legend has it that whosoever wanders into the mansion, comes out as an animal! No one in the village dares to enter the mansion. Things are going fine for Chunni until the day one of her pranks gets quite out of hand. Chunni, her sister and her friend Mughal-e-azam are constantly at the odds with the local butcher, Kallu (Makarand Deshpande). Once Kallu chases Munni, Chunni's docile twin to the mansion mistaking her for Chunni in a fit of rage. As a result of this, Munni, her docile sister, enters the mansion, where presumably the witch has turned the little girl into a hen. Chunni is hysterical when she discovers this. She runs from pillar to post to get help, but her credibility is at an all-time low and the entire village refuses to believe her, so Chunni finally enters the haunted mansion alone to search for her sister. In the mansion she comes face to face with the witch, she pleads with the witch to let her poor little sister go, as it was no fault of hers. But the witch asks her to strike a deal. She will turn Munni back into a human only if Chunni can acquire for her hundred hens in exchange. All of a sudden, Chunni is confronted with the biggest challenge of her life. Chunni's school master visits the mansion but a small puppy is seen exiting the mansion and people presume the witch has turned him into a puppy. Mughal-e-azam after spotting the puppy realizes it is his pet dog that had entered the mansion and has disappeared ever since. Its then Chunni realises that all this was just a ruse. Makdee is not a witch and she does not really turn humans into animals; she merely locks them up and has some plans of her own. She is actually a con-woman who has been looking for a treasure that has been hidden in the village and so she abducts many children to dig up the place to find the treasure. She is accompanied by those two policemen who are actually helping in her plan all the way. However, as soon as Chunni finds the treasure, the con-woman traps everyone including the policemen in an attempt to flee the village. She is confronted by Kallu who enters her mansion in looking for the children. The kids and other people beat up the policemen for their notoriety and helps Chunni to stop the con-woman. The con-woman and Kallu are engaged in a brief fight before Chunni shows up and traps the woman in a similar way that she did to all the people. The con- woman falls into her own trap and gets beaten by the children. All the people locked up are finally freed and the village finds a new hero in Chunni.

Invented in 1992 by Georges Charpak and Ioannis Giomataris, the Micromegas detectors are mainly used in experimental physics, in particular in particle physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics for the detection of ionising particles. A Micromegas detector in function on the COMPASS spectrometer The Micromegas are light detectors in order to minimize the perturbation on the impinging particle. From their small amplification gap, they have fast signals in the order of 100 nanoseconds. They are a type of micropattern gaseous detector with a spatial resolution below one hundred micrometers.J.P. Cussonneau et al./Nucl. Instr. and Meth. in Phys. Res. A 419 (1998) 452‚Äî459 Nowadays, the use of the Micromegas technology is growing over the different fields of experimental physics.  Working principle  Working principle of a Micromegas detector. A particle detector is used to detect a passing particle and obtain information such as its position, arrival time and momentum. In experimental physics, the particle is usually coming from a particle accelerator but it can also come from space (cosmic ray) or from a nuclear reactor. The Micromegas detector detects particles by amplifying the charges that have been created by ionisation in the gas volume. In a Micromegas detector, this gas volume is divided in two by a metallic micro-mesh (‚ÄúMicromesh‚Äù on the schematic) placed between 25 Œºm and 150 Œºm of the readout electrode (Strips on the schematic). The micro-mesh is the key element since it allows, at the same time, a high gain of 104 and a fast signal of 100 ns. = Ionisation and charge amplification = While passing through the detector, a particle will ionise the gas atoms by pulling up an electron creating an electron/ion pair (1). When no electric field is applied, the ion/electron pair recombines and nothing happens. But here, within an electric field in the order of 400 V/cm the electron will drift (2) toward the amplification electrode (the mesh) and the ion toward the cathode. When the electron arrives close to the mesh (3), it enters an intense electric field (typically on the order of 40 kV/cm in the amplification gap). Accelerated by this field, the electron reaches enough energy to produce ion/electron pairs that will also ionise the gas, creating pairs; it is the avalanche effect (4). By this means, several thousand pairs are created from hundreds of primary charges, which originate from the interactions with the impinging particle. The primary charges need to be multiplied to create a significant signal. A last, we read the electronic signal on the readout electrode (5) by a charge amplifier. The readout electrode is usually segmented in strips and/or pixels in order to obtain the position of the impinging particle in the detector. The amplitude and the shape of the signal, read via the electronic on the readout electrode, gives information on the time and energy of the particle. = Analog signal of a Micromegas = Signal induced on the readout electrode of a Micromegas detector (Simulation). The blue curve shows the part of the signal induced by electrons and the red one by ions. The signal is induced by the movement of charges between the micro-mesh and the readout electrode (this volume is called the amplification gap). The 100 nanoseconds signal consists of an electron peak (blue) and an ion tail (red). Since the electron mobility in gas is over 1000 times faster than the ion mobility, the electronic signal is much shorter (below 3ns) than the ionic one. That is why it is used to measure precisely the time. The ionic signal carries more than half of the signal and is used to reconstruct the energy of the particle.  History  = First concept at the Hadron Blind Detector = In 1991, to improve the detection of hadrons at the Hadron Blind Detector experiment,Hadron Blind Detector(HBD): created by : ref: I. Giomataris,G. Charpak, NIM A310(1991)589 I. Giomataris and G. Charpak reduced the amplification gap of a parallel plate detector (a type of spark chamber) in order to speed up the signal. A 1 mm amplification gap prototype was built for the HDB experiment but the gain was not uniform enough to be used in the experiment. The millimetre gap was not enough controlled and created large gain fluctuations. Nevertheless, the benefits of a reduce amplification gap has been demonstrated and the Micro- Mesh gaseous structure or Micromegas concept was born in October 1992, shortly before the announcement of the Nobel prize attribution to Georges Charpak for the invention of the wire chambers. Georges Charpak used to say that this detector and some other new concepts belonging to the family of micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) will revolutionise nuclear and particle physics just as his detector did. = The Micromegas technology research and development = Starting in 1992 at CEA Saclay and CERN, the Micromegas technology has been developed to provide more stable, reliable, precise and faster detectors. In 2001, twelve large Micromegas detectors plane of 40 x 40 cm2 were used for the first time in a large scale experiment at COMPASS situated on the Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator at CERN. Since 2002 they have been detecting millions of different particles per seconds and still continue today. Another example of the development of the Micromegas detectors is the invention of the ‚Äúbulk‚Äù technology. The ‚Äúbulk‚Äù technology consists of the integration of the micro-mesh with the printed circuit board (that carries the readout electrodes) in order to build a monolithic detector. Such a detector is very robust and can be produced within an industrial process (a successful try has been conducted with the 3M firm in 2006) allowing public applications. For instance, by modifying the micro-mesh in order to make it photo-sensitive to UV light, the Micromegas can be used to prevent forest fires. The concept of a photo-sensitive Micromegas is further used to develope Micromegas for fast- timing applications. The PICOSEC-Micromegas uses a Cherenkov radiator and a photocathode in front of the gaseous volume and a time resolution of 24 ps is measured with MIPs. One of the first experiments with Micromegas detectors: COMPASS. On this 2001 pictures, we see Georges Charpak and the COMPASS Saclay team in front of the large Micromegas chambers. = Micromegas detectors in experimental physics = The Micromegas detectors are now used in several experiments : * Hadronic physics: COMPASS, NA48, and projects for the ILC-TPC and CLAS12 at J-lab are under active study * Particle physics: T2K, CAST, HELAZZ * Neutron physics : nTOF, ESS nBLM Micromegas detector will be used from the ATLAS experiment, as part of their upgrade of its future muon spectrometer.

He specialised in Coccoidea but also worked on Coleoptera. Balachowsky worked at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle. In 1948 he was elected president of the Soci√©t√© entomologique de France. Balachowsky was part of the Prosper Network in Paris during WWII, a spy network run by the British SOE. After the network was infiltrated and betrayed, Balachowsky was arrested and ultimately imprisoned at the Buchenwald Concentration Camp outside Weimar, Germany. Sent to Camp Dora on 1 February 1944, he was brought back to Buchenwald May 1 of the same year to work developing a vaccine for typhus. He also went to work helping the various underground groups inside the camp and established a network of contacts who fed him information from the camp's commanders. Along with Eugen Kogon, Balachowsky was instrumental in the survival of several British SOE officers who were among a group sent to Buchenwald for execution. Most of the group were murdered there, but several, most notably Edward Yeo-Thomas, Harry Peulev√© and Free French agent St√©phane Hessel, escaped through the help of Balachowsky and his staff who exchanged them for the bodies of typhus patients in their test group. It is also believed that Balachowsky had a hand in getting 168 imprisoned Allied airmen including Phil Lamason out of Buchenwald and into the hands of the German Luftwaffe just days before they were set to be executed. After the war, Balachowsky testified at the Nuremberg Trials.

When it consists in placing in the hands of the donee some movable object it is known as a gift of hand (donum manuale, an offering or oblatio, an alms). Properly speaking, however, it is a voluntary contract, verbal or written, by which the donor expressly agrees to give, without consideration, something to the donee, and the latter in an equally express manner accepts the gift. In Roman law and in some modern codes this contract carries with it only the obligation of transferring the ownership of the thing in question; actual ownership is obtained only by the real traditio or handing over of the thing itself, or by the observation of certain juridically prescribed formalities.L. 20, C. De pactis, II, 3 Such codes distinguish between conventional (or imperfect) and perfect donation, i.e. the actual transfer of the thing or right. In some countries the contract itself transfers ownership. A donation is called remunerative when inspired by a sentiment of gratitude for services rendered by the donee. Donations are also described as inter vivos if made while the donor yet lives, and causa mortis, when made in view or contemplation of death; the latter are valid only after the death of the donor and until then are at all times revocable. They much resemble testaments and codicils. They are, however, on the same footing as donations inter vivos once the donor has renounced his right to revoke. In the pursuit of its end the church needs material aid; it has the right therefore to acquire such aid by donation no less than by other means. In its quality of a perfect and independent society the Roman Catholic Church may also decide under what forms and on what conditions it will accept donations made to works of religion (donationes ad pias causas; English: donations toward pious causes); it pertains to the State to legislate for all other donations. History of ecclesiastical donations Even before the Edict of Milan (313) the Church was free to acquire property by donation either as a juridically recognized association (collegium) or as a society de facto tolerated (note that the right to acquire property by last will and testament dates only from 321 in the reign of Constantine I). Nevertheless, the Church was held to observe the pertinent civil legislation, though on this head it enjoyed certain privileges; thus, even before the traditio, or handing over, of the donation to a church or a religious institution, the latter acquired real rights to the same.L. 23, C. De sacrosanctis ecclesiis, I, 2 Moreover, the insinuatio or declaration of the gift before the public authority was required only for donations equivalent in value to 500 solidi (nearly twenty-six hundred dollars) or more, a privilege later on extended to all donations.L. 34, 36, C. De donationibus, VIII, 53 Finally, bishops, priests, and deacons yet under parental power were allowed to dispose freely, even in favour of the Church, of property acquired by them after ordination [L. 33 (34) C. De episcopis et clericis, I, 3]. The Franks, long quite unaccustomed to dispose of their property by will, were on the other hand generous in donations, especially cessiones post obitum, similar to the Roman law donations in view of death but carrying with them the renunciation on the donor's part of his right of revocation; other Frankish donations to the Church reserved the usufruct. The institution known as precaria ecclesiastica was quite favourable to the growth of donations. At the request of the donor the Church granted him the use of the donated object for five years, for his life, or even a use transferable to the heirs of the first occupant. Synods of this epoch assert to some extent the validity of pious donations even when the legal requisites had not been observed, though as a rule they were not omitted. Generally speaking, the consent of the civil authority (princeps) was not indispensable for the acquisition of property by religious corporations. The restrictions known as the \\"right of amortization\\" are of later date, and are the outcome of theories elaborated in the Middle Ages but carried to their logical issue in the modern civil legislation (of Continental countries) concerning biens de mainmorte, or property held by inalienable tenure, i.e. the property of religious corporations, they being perpetual. The Church does not accept such legislation; nevertheless the faithful may act accordingly in order to secure to their donations the protection of the law. Canonical legislation Donations are valid and obligatory when made by persons capable of disposing of their property and accepted by the administrators of ecclesiastical institutions. No other formality is required, neither notarial act nor authorization of the civil power. The declaration before the public authority, required by Roman law, is not obligatory in canon law. Nor are the faithful obliged to heed the restrictions which are placed by some modern civil codes in the way of a free disposition of their property. On the other hand, the donation must be accepted by the donee; it is not true, as some have maintained, that every donation for works of religion (ad pias causas) implies a vow, i.e. an act in itself obligatory independently of the acceptance of the donee. If the administrators of an ecclesiastical institution refuse to accept a donation, that institution can always obtain in canon law a restitutio in integrum, whereby it is again put in a condition to accept the refused donation. The canonical motives for the revocation or diminution of a donation are the birth of children to the donor and the donatio inofficiosa, or excessive generosity on the latter's part, whereby he diminishes the share of inheritance that legitimately belongs to his children. In both cases, however, the donation is valid in Canon law to the degree in which it respects the legitimate share of the donor's children. It is worthy of note that while ecclesiastical and religious establishments may give alms, they are bound in the matter of genuine donations by the provisions of the canon law concerning the alienation of ecclesiastical property. Civil legislation (by 1910)  In most European countries by 1910 the civil authority restricted in three ways the right of the Roman Catholic Church to accept donations: * by imposing the forms and conditions that the civil codes prescribe for donations; * by reserving to itself the right of saying what institutions shall have civil personality and be thereby authorized to acquire property; * by exacting the approval of the civil authority, at least for important donations. Austria recognized a juridical personality not only in those religious institutions which are charged with the maintenance of public worship, but also, through easily granted approval, in religious associations of any kind. The so-called amortization laws (against the traditional inalienability of tenure on the part of religious corporations) remained only a threat, though the Government reserved the right to establish such legislation. Religious communities, however, were required to make known to the civil authorities all their acquisitions of property. In Germany, even since the promulgation of the Civil Code of the Empire (1896), the legislation varied from State to State. In all, however, property rights were recognized by the law in only those ecclesiastical institutions that are recognized by the State. As a rule, donations had to be authorized by the civil power if they exceed the value of five thousand marks (1250 dollars, or 250 pounds sterling) though in some states this figure was doubled. In Prussia civil authorization was requisite for all acquisition of real property by a diocese, a chapter, or any ecclesiastical institution. In Italy every donation had to be approved by the civil authority, and only the institutions recognized by the State are allowed to acquire property; note, however, that simple benefices and religious orders could not acquire this latter privilege. With few exceptions, ecclesiastical institutions in Italy were not allowed to invest in any other form of property than Government bonds. In France the associations cultuelles, or worship- associations, were recognized by the State as civil entities for the conduct of public worship; it is well known, however, that Pope Pius X forbade the Catholics of France to form such associations. That country recognized the civil personality of licit associations organized for a non-lucrative purpose, but declared illicit every religious congregation not approved by a special law. At the same time, it refused to approve the religious congregations which have sought this approval.

During the First World War, Rebbe Eiss set up an aid system that located refugees, found out what they most needed and raised the required funds.

Both places fit the geographical description. now Poland; as one of 11 children of Rebbe Moshe Nissan Eiss and his wife Myria n√©e Kessler. He was the only one of the children to survive an epidemic of diphtheria, an illness for which there was no treatment at the time. After the death of his other children, his father Rebbe Moshe Nissan Eiss took young Yisroel to the Sadigora Rebbe who blessed him and gave him an additional name, Chaim. Eiss got no secular education. ‚ÄòI taught myself to write at a later age. I did not learn any trade either as my father wanted me to be a rabbi. For this reason, I then only completed Jewish religious studies‚Äô, he declared in 1943. In 1900, he moved to Switzerland and came to Zurich where he wanted to study. However, having no money, he started working as a door-to-door vendor. Later, in 1901, Eiss acquired his own shop. Later on he married Adele Holles. The couple had 10 children. Agudath Israel Eiss was a founding member of Agudath Israel and one of its main activists. He operated mainly behind the scenes and every proposal that was brought to the presidium for ratification was first presented to him . During the First World War, Eiss set up a large aid system that located refugees, found out what they most needed and raised the required funds . Eiss was entrusted by the leading Rabbis of the time with the directorship of all Switzerland-based Agudath Israel funds. These included the Orphan Aid Fund, the Land of Israel Yeshiva Fund and the Polish and Lithuanian Yeshiva Fund. He received contributions from all over the world, and transferred the money to the recipients. Eiss was a writer and published the Agudath Israel publication Haderech. He wrote all the articles himself and was personally responsible for printing and distributing the paper.https://web.archive.org/web/20120722175056/http://planetnana.co.il/eiss/english.htm He was also a regular contributor to the then Agudath Israel weekly Kol Yisrael, printed in Jerusalem, and used it to make his opinions known to the population of Eretz Israel . Rescue work Eiss lived in Switzerland, which was neutral during World War II, and was therefore able to serve as the link between people living in countries under Nazi occupation and residents of the free world. He transferred information and requests for help to the Agudath Israel offices in London, New York City, and Istanbul, and facilitated the transfer of money, passport photographs, and requests to locate family members into Europe. He received hundreds of letters from Nazi-occupied countries and was one of the first to obtain a clear picture of the atrocities that were being carried out there . Interrogated by the Swiss police in May 1943, Eiss admitted to have worked together with Polish diplomats to illegally obtain fake passport from a corrupted honorary consul of Paraguay Rudolf Hugli. ‚ÄòI always contact the Polish Consul, Rokicki, who then, in turn, contacts the Paraguayan Consul, H√ºgli in Bern, who issues the documents. Then, presumably, Rokicki must pay some amount to Mr H√ºgli. The certificates are then be sent to Poland in the original, whereas the passports are to be photocopied and the copies notarised‚Äô, . Eiss would then obtain the copies of the passports, presumably through the Polish-Jewish diplomat Juliusz K√ºhl, right-hand of the envoy of Poland Aleksander ≈Åado≈õ and have them smuggled into the German occupation zone. The letters contained certificates showing that the person concerned had been granted the Paraguayan citizenship. In many cases, Eiss provided the names of his acquaintances as the senders so as to make sure that his own name was not revealed to the censorship authorities. ‚ÄòAll the addressees were religious Jewish persons living in Warsaw and Bƒôdzin‚Äô, he declared. The bearers of the Paraguayan passports would be placed in the internment camps in occupied France and Germany rather than sent to the extermination camps. Thus, hundreds of them managed to survive the war. In 1944, Poland forced Paraguay to temporarily recognize the validity of the passports. The communications system that Eiss set up to have the documents smuggled was complex and not without danger. The unofficial postal service was conducted by non-Jewish residents of the occupied countries, people he referred to in his letters as pure Aryans , and the phraseology that was used was designed to pass muster with the censors while being understood by the intended recipients. An example of this can be seen in a letter that he wrote to Agudath Israel‚Äôs American branch at an early stage, before people were yet aware of the Nazis‚Äô extermination efforts. It stated: \\"Our friend Rav Alexander Susha Friedman wrote me a letter of thanks on behalf of Mr. Mekayem Nefesh\\" and that \\"Mr. Chalelei Raav (Dying of Hunger) is a permanent guest at our friends' homes.\\" Sometimes he was able to be more explicit, and he wrote to the London branch of Agudath Israel, \\"The situation of our French brethren and even more, of our Polish brethren, is getting worse each day. In Warsaw the Jews are dying at a rate of 6,000 per month, mostly from hunger.\\" Hundreds, maybe thousands of people were prevented from dying by Eiss‚Äôs efforts, but these were not the only people he helped. Thousands of Jews trapped in occupied Europe were given hope by his activities. Eiss died in November 1943 survived by his wife and eight out of ten children. Eiss Archive created in 2019 is named after him. Political Views Eiss was critical of the Mizrachi movement. He wrote that Mizrachi did not teach its children the Torah but instead had a new religion, that of labor . According to Eiss, the only reason that Mizrachi affiliated itself to the Zionists was in order to receive monetary gain . Eiss was also critical of the secular educational system. He wrote that \\"Forty thousand of the children of our people are being educated in schools which are such that the children will not turn out to be apikorsim (heretics), because they will not know enough Torah to be able to rebel against it, but will turn out to be ignoramuses.\\" See also * ≈Åado≈õ Group * Yad Vashem References * Chaim Yisroel Eiss‚Äô Interrogation Report, 13 May 1943, Swiss Federal Archives E4320 (B) 1990/266, vol. 237 External links * Chaim Yisroel Eiss, the Man at the Center of Orthodoxy‚Äôs WWII Rescue Activities * The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority (Yad Vashem) article on Chaim Yisrael Eiss Category:1876 births Category:1942 deaths Category:≈Åado≈õ Group members Category:Polish Jews Category:People from Bieszczady County Category:People who rescued Jews during the Holocaust Category:Recipients of the Virtus et Fraternitas Medal ","title":"Chaim Yisroel Eiss"},{"id":"11895278","text":"Sconcerto is an album by Italian singer Mina, issued in 2001.

Antonio had been obsessed with the cult of the angels since the days when he was choirmaster in the cathedral of Palermo, 1513-15. At that time he discovered in the little Church of Sant'Angelo an ancient icon of the Seven Angelic Princes that emerged as if miraculously preserved from centuries of disuse.Website Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri. Fired with his faith, he travelled to Rome, harboring the intention of obtaining formal recognition of these Sette Principi angelici. In Rome he obtained a post as chaplain to Antonio Maria Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte, uncle of the future Pope Julius III. For the cardinal he composed a liturgy for a Mass of the Seven Angels. After his patron's death in 1533, he served as chaplain to don Fernando de Silva, conde de Cifuentes, ambassador of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, never failing to seek official approval for his liturgy. In vain were his importunings of Pope Paul III Farnese, who assigned him duties that returned him to his native Sicily. Once again in Rome, he became chaplain in Santa Maria di Loreto in Trajan's Forum. There, one summer morning in 1541 he had a beatific vision of the Seven Martyr Saints‚Äî Saints Saturnino, Ciriaco, Largo, Smaragdo, Sisinnio, Trasone and Pope Marcellus I‚Äî revealed in a white light within the ruins of the Baths of Diocletian. From that moment he was fixated on seeing a church dedicated to those built within the ruins. He inscribed seven of the great red granite Roman columns of the caldarium with the names in his list of Seven Archangels: the three familiar ones, Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel, with the archangels specific to Eastern Orthodoxy:Sicily had been a Byzantine possession until the Muslim Arab conquest of 827-902. Selaphiel, Jegudiel, Barachiel and Uriel. His beseeching letter of 13 November 1546 to Signora Lucrezia della Rovere-Colonnaon-line text of the letter to intercede with Paul III on behalf of the project survives: it must have been one among many. In 1543 he combined a pilgrimage to the Santa Casa di Loreto with a trip to Venice to have the booklet of his liturgy printed, with prayers and images of the angels and while he was there commissioned a copy of the mosaic in the Basilica of San Marco depicting the Virgin among the Seven Angels,The painting hangs at the centre of the apse of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri. In Rome once more, Antonio accepted the rectorship of the Orfanelli di Santa Maria in Aquiro, continuing to frequent the thermae and pressing Paul III to consecrate the grand Roman ruin to the Beatissima Vergine dei Sette Arcangeli. Finally the construction was authorized by Pope Pius IV, in a brief of 27 July 1561 that dedicated the church to the \\"Beatissimae Virgini et omnium Angelorum et Martyrum\\", \\"the most Holy Virgin and all the Angels and Martyrs\\", and conceded the direction to the Certosini. The designer of the new church was Michelangelo, one of his last commissions. Notes References *Bailey, Gauvin Alexander. Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit Art in Rome, 1565‚Äì1610.

The Kiandra Snow Shoe Club was founded in the gold-mining district of Kiandra, New South Wales (NSW), Australia by three Norwegians‚Äîas early as 1861 by some accounts‚Äî and reportedly became the \\"world's longest continuously running ski club\\" as it evolved into the present-day Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club in Perisher Valley, NSW. Whether the club is the first of its kind has been subject to debate. The debate hinges on whether the club was founded in 1861 or later. According to Clarke, Cross made a number of claims suggesting insufficient snow in the time period. Clarke counters with news accounts of snow and skiing activity during 1861. Clarke reports that as of 1929, there was no proof that the club had been formed before 1870, which was deemed to be a supportable approximate date, based on the living memories of those who remembered its formation. Clarke instead relies on a 2006 letter from the Holmenkollen Ski Museum and a 2011 letter from the FIS president on the occasion of the Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club's 150th anniversary as validation for the claim of an 1861 founding of the club. As of 2016, there are no contemporary news accounts of the founding of the club available through the National Library of Australia on-line search utility. The 1861 founding was accepted in a 1935 The Sydney Morning Herald account and in a 2011 book by Tredinnick. In this case, \\"snow shoe\\" is an archaic term for \\"ski\\". History As reported by Vaage, Norwegian gold miners introduced skiing in California in the 1850s. A few years later, some moved on to Australia when the news about gold at Kiandra reached California. These Norwegians introduced skiing to Kiandra as a form of recreation, as had occurred in California. The Manaro Mercury of July 29, 1861 reported that young people climbed the hills of Kiambra with [skis] and came back down at high speed. Andresen reports that, from the gold rush in 1860-1861 onwards, there were annual \\"ski carnivals\\" at Kiandra. According to Clarke, the International Ski Federation (FIS) recognized the club \\"for having organized the first Alpine [sic] ski races in the history of [the] sport\\" in a 2011 letter. =Club founding= Vaage suggests that the Kiandra Snow Shoe Club was established around 1870, but reports that the date and circumstances are indefinite. According to Skiing Magazine, the first downhill races occurred in 1861 and the club was founded in 1870. Between the years 1861 and 1863, the Australian club members constructed and used a short, broad ski, which was designed specifically for skiing downhill and called the \\"Kiandra kick-in\\" (referring to kicking one's boot into the binding strap). According to Andresen, Jens Olsen from Tj√∏lling, Norway, gave up gold digging and instead set up a ski manufacturing workshop, the first such factory in Australia. Andresen suggests that Jens Olsen was one of the founders of the Kiandra Snow Shoe Club. There were championships held for cross-country skiing and ski jumping, starting in 1878. =Competitions= A variety of ethnic backgrounds were represented in the ski competitions at Kiandra. The Manaro Mercury of August 10, 1887 mentions a little girl and a lady of Chinese descent, both winning races in their category. Chinese names appear again among the winners in 1894. Vaage reports that skiers at Kiandra used wax made from oil, rubber or fat to increase downhill speed‚Äîmethods that may have been introduced from California. Skis used at Kiandra were not suited for turning, so downhill races were in a straight line only. In 1908 the club reportedly held an \\"International Ski Carnival\\"‚Äîincluding an \\"International Downhill Race\\", which was won by an American, competing on skis made in Kiandra; other events included races for youths in categories of under eight, ten, eleven and fourteen years of age. \\"Open Championships\\" were also conducted; the events concluded with a \\"New Chum\\" event and toboggan race. Competitions continued at least until 1911, despite a decline in gold mining. Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club In 1929, the club reorganized as the Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club. At its 1935 annual competition, \\"orthodox\\" and \\"straight\\" down-hill competitions were held. Covering the event, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that, \\"The Kiandra Club, which was formerly called the Kiandra Snow Shoe Club, is now 65 years old, and is probably the oldest ski club in the world.\\" This claim was echoed by Tredinnick in 2011. As of 2016, the club operated as the \\"Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club (1861) Limited\\" and was located in Perisher Valley, New South Wales, its new home as of 1966.

It was once one of the main stableyards for Liverpool Corporation, but is now a development site and party redeveloped as the location of The Williamson Tunnels Heritage Centre. History The stableyard came into the possession of Liverpool Corporation in 1858 and in 1867, with the appointment of a veterinary surgeon and shire horse enthusiast, Richard Reynolds became one of several 'stud' stables owned by the Corporation, Reynolds having persuaded the city fathers that keeping and breeding their own horses was cheaper and more efficient than relying on private contractors. The Central Stables at one time accommodated upwards of 50 horses, ranging from ponies to the shires for which the City of Liverpool was famous in the early years of the 20th century. The duties of these horses covered everything from transporting mail and Corporation personnel around the city to moving the heaviest of loads. In 1924 two horses belonging to Liverpool Corporation, 'Vesuvius' and 'Umber', appeared at the British Empire exhibition at Wembley and from a standing start pulled a load estimated at 50 tons. This record has never been equaled or beaten and the two geldings received a heroes' welcome when they returned to Liverpool. The Central Stables was home to some of Liverpool's mightiest horses until 1960 when the last of the working horses were 'phased out'. From this time onwards the yard was home to the motorised bin wagons of the Corporation Cleansing department and just a few reminders of the past - the proud horses which were retained to haul the City of Liverpool State Coach on grand civic occasions. The Central Stables were finally closed in 1993 and put on the market as a prime development opportunity, but they had not seen their last horse - in late April 2000 they were used briefly to house overnighting horses from around Britain for the Millennium Liverpool May Horse Parade.

Situated in a spectacular setting between the heights of Canisp, Quinag and Beinn Uidhe, it receives the outflow from Lochs Awe, Maol a' Choire, and Leitir Easaich. It discharges into the sea at Loch Inver, via the river Inver.

Instead of jumping to her death, they believe Eimhir plunged into the caverns of the Loch and, hiding from the devil to whom she was promised, made a new home beneath the water's surface, becoming the elusive 'mermaid of Assynt'. The locals also use this legend to account for natural changes in the landscape. When the loch's water rise above their normal levels, legend tells that these are Eimhir's tears mourning her life lost on the land. Some even claim to have sighted her weeping on the rocks, her body now transformed into half woman, half sea creature. Some contest her form, instead calling her Selkie, the Nordic mythological figure of the sea, who must first shed tears into the water in order to become visible again to the human eye. The legend also accounts for the geology of Inchnadamph. Clootie, infuriated by the broken promise of marriage summoned meteoric rocks from Chaos to obliterate Inchnadamph and MacLeod's kingdom. It is thought that this legend bears some relationship with the scientific findings that indicate north west Scotland was struck by an object from space around 1.2 billion years ago. Geologists from Aberdeen university described the event; \\"[a] massive impact would have melted rocks and thrown up an enormous cloud of vapour that scattered material over a large part of the region around Ullapool. The crater was rapidly buried by sandstone which helped to preserve the evidence.\\" These legends are invoked to offer some mythical explanation for the unique geological and topographical character of Inchnadamph. Another version of the tale of the mermaid of Assynt relates to the creation of the Moine Thrust belt. Some believe Clootie's rage produced a tectonic rumbling from the earths core, resulting in the thrust westwards of the European plate, which is understood by geologists to account for the Moine Thrust belt.

History There have been two distinct Navy squadrons known as the \\"Flying Eagles\\". The first was established in 1950 as VC-35, later redesignated VA(AW)-35, and then VA-122 and was disestablished in May 1991. Often, the new squadron will assume the nickname, insignia, and traditions of the earlier squadrons, but officially, the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage with decommissioned squadrons if a new squadron is formed with the same designation.http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq6-1.htm In January 1999 a new Flying Eagles squadron was established as Strike Fighter Squadron 122 (VFA-122), the first squadron to operate the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. On 1 October 2010 VFA-125 (the \\"legacy\\" F/A-18 Hornet FRS also stationed at NAS Lemoore) was deactivated and the squadron's aircraft and personnel were absorbed into VFA-122. The merger was intended to cut administrative costs and streamline production in anticipation of the \\"legacy\\" F/A-18 Hornet being phased out by the Super Hornet and F-35 Lightning II in the coming years. The merged squadron retained the Flying Eagles insignia and the Rough Raiders of VFA-125 were deactivated. Mission VFA-122 Carrier flight qualifications aboard , August 2011 As the West Coast Hornet and Super Hornet Fleet Replacement Squadron, the squadron's mission is to train Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18A/B/C/D/E/F Replacement Pilots and Weapon Systems Officers (WSOs) to support fleet commitments. Every 6 weeks a class of between 8‚Äì12 newly winged Navy pilots and Naval Flight Officers begins the 9-month training course in which they learn the basics of air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, culminating in day/night carrier qualification and subsequent assignment to fleet Hornet squadrons. VFA-122's East Coast counterpart is VFA-106 at NAS Oceana. Aircrew returning from non-flying assignments undergo refresher training at VFA-122 prior to returning to the fleet. Additionally, VFA-122 (with the help from the Center of Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit: CNATTTU) trains maintenance personnel and provides replacement aircraft to fleet units. VFA-122 currently has approximately 225 officers, 408 enlisted personnel and operates over 60 aircraft. The squadron often detaches aircraft to Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada and Naval Air Facility El Centro, California, as well as various aircraft carriers for carrier qualifications (CQ). Significant Mishaps On 6 April 2011, squadron pilot Matthew I. Lowe, 33, and weapons systems officer Nathan H. Williams, 26, were killed when their F/A-18 crashed half a mile from NAS Lemoore on a routine training mission.Fuentes, Gidget, \\"Navy releases names of F/A-18F crash victims\\", Military Times, 7 April 2011.

English colonists often referred to them as one of the Settlement Indians of South Carolina, tribes who \\"settled\\" among the colonists. Five of the groups were recorded by the settlers as having spoken a common language, although one distinctly different from the major language families known nearby, such as Algonquian, Iroquoian, Muskogean, and Siouan. With the English settling on their land at Charleston beginning in the 17th century, the Cusabo developed a chafing relationship with the colony that persisted through the early 18th century. After the Yamasee War of 1715, also known as the Gullah Wars, surviving tribal members migrated to join the Creek or Catawba. Political divisions Subtribes of the Cusabo included the Ashepoo (Ishpow), Combahee, cusso(also spelled Coosaw, Coosawa, Cussoe, or Kussoe; not the same people as the earlier Coosa chiefdom of the Mississippian culture in Georgia), Edisto (also spelled Edistow), Escamacu (also St. Helena Indians), Etiwaw tribe (also Etiwan, Ittawan or Eutaw), Kiawah, Stono, Bohicket, Wando, Wappoo and Wimbee.\\"Cusabo\\", South Carolina Indians, South Carolina Information Highway Non-Cusabo Settlement Indians listed in a 1696 report include the Sewee and Santee. Language Although in the 1930s anthropologist John Swanton theorized that the Cusabo may have spoken a form of the Muskogean language, more recent research disputes this. The language spoken by the Cusabo is virtually unknown and now extinct. It did not appear to be related to other known language families on the North American continent. There is evidence that at least five tribes on the coast, in the territory from the lower Savannah to the Wando River (east of Charleston), spoke a common language which was different from the Guale and Sewee languages of neighboring peoples. It is likely the Ashepoo, Combahee, Escama√ßu, Etiwan, and Kiawah also spoke this language, which has been referred to as Cusaboan. Only a few words (mostly town names) of this language were recorded in the 16th century by the French explorer Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re. (One example was Skorrye or Skerry, meaning \\"bad\\" or \\"enemy\\"). Most words lack translations. Approximately 100 place names and 12 personal names in Cusabo have survived. The place names do not seem to be related to Algonquian, Iroquoian, Muskogean languages or Siouan languages used by other South Carolina coastal and Piedmont tribes. (In places where the Sewee and Santee lived, the place names are in the Catawban languages.) John R. Swanton thought that the bou or boo element, presumably the same bou in the Cusabo word Westo boe meaning \\"Westoe River\\", which occurs in many coastal place names, is related to the Choctaw -bok (river). He speculated that Cusabo was related to the Muskogean family. Later scholars think this relation of sounds might have been a coincidence without meaning, especially since the older Choctaw form was (small river, river forming part of a delta). They believe that Cusabo was from a different language family.Goddard, Ives. (2005). \\"The indigenous languages of the Southeast\\", in Anthropological Linguistics, 47 (1), 1-60.; Martin, Jack. (2004). \\"Languages\\", in R. D. Fogelson (Ed.), Handbook of North American Indians: Southeast (Vol. 14, pp. 68-86). Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution.; Waddell, Gene. (2004). \\"Cusabo\\", in R. D. Fogelson (Ed.), Handbook of North American Indians: Southeast (Vol. 14, pp. 254-264). Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution. Blair Rudes has suggested that the suffix and other evidence may indicate a relationship to the Arawakan languages of the Caribbean indigenous peoples.Rudes, Blair A. \\"Pre-Columbian Links to the Caribbean: Evidence Connecting Cusabo to Taino\\", paper presented at Language Variety in the South III conference, Tuscaloosa, AL, 16 April 2004. If true, it would mean that parts of the Atlantic Coast may have been settled by indigenous peoples from the Caribbean islands. History The names of many subtribes of the Cusabo and Catawba may be recognized among the provinces that were described by Francisco de Chicora, a native who was kidnapped from the Pee Dee River area by Spanish in 1521, and accompanied an expedition back to Spain, where he learned the language. His Testimony of Francisco de Chicora was recorded by the court chronicler Peter Martyr and published in 1525. In 1526, Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n's party visited this area and recorded some names. The English colony of South Carolina was founded in the midst of Cusabo land, and the loose group of tribes became closely tied to the colony. In the first decade after the founding of Charles Town in 1670, there was conflict and warfare between some of the Cusabo and the new colony. The Kussoe (Coosa) subtribe was the first to come into violent conflict; Carolina declared war against them in October 1671. The Kussoe went into hiding but remained in the area. In the early years of the colony, it was not difficult for Indians to \\"lie low\\" if they wanted. For three years, colonial records make no mention of the Kussoe or the war. In 1674 records note an alleged Kussoe attack in which three colonists were killed. During the same year the Stono, a Cusabo subtribe, fought with the colony. This conflict (not to be confused with the later Stono Rebellion of African slaves) was similar to the Kussoe War. Colonial records are unclear on how the Kussoe-Stono War ended, except that it was resolved in South Carolina's favor. The colony forced the tribes to cede large tracts of rich land. In addition, they required the Kussoe to make a symbolic tribute payment of one deerskin per month. The Kussoe, Stono, and other Cusabo subtribes remained in the area, living in relative accord with the colonists until the Yamasee War of 1715. One of South Carolina's first powerful Indian allies was the Westo tribe, who during the 1670s conducted numerous slave raid attacks on nearly every other Indian group in the region. Contemporary scholars believe the Westo were an Iroquoian tribe who had migrated from the Great Lakes area, possibly an offshoot of the Erie during the Beaver Wars.Worth, John E. (2000), \\"The Lower Creeks: Origins and Early History\\", in Bonnie G. McEwan (ed.), Indians of the Greater Southeast: Historical Archaeology and Ethnohistory, Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, p.17Bowne, Eric E. (2000), \\"The Rise and Fall of the Westo Indians\\", Early Georgia: Journal of the Society for Georgia Archaeology 28 (1): 56‚Äì78, OCLC 1567184Bowne, Eric E. (2005), The Westo Indians: Slave Traders of the Early Colonial South, Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press By the late 1670s, South Carolina colonists came into direct conflict with the Westo. The colony demanded that the Westo cease attacking the Cusabo and other Settlement Indians. Continued Westo attacks played a role in South Carolina's decision to destroy the Westo, which they did with assistance from other Native Americans in 1679-1680. By the turn of the eighteenth century, the Cusabo had become fairly integrated into South Carolina's society, although they retained their tribal identities and lived in their own villages. A relationship developed between the two groups, with the Indians serving as a kind of police and security force in exchange for trade goods, weapons, and money. The colony paid the Cusabo for killing \\"vermin\\" such as wolves, \\"tigers\\" (cougars), and bears. The Cusabo also hunted game animals and sold the meat to colonists. But their chief service was in capturing fugitive African slaves. South Carolina colonial authorities tried to encourage hostility between the two groups to avoid an alliance between them. They passed laws to reward Indians for capturing runaway slaves, and absolved them of liability if runaways were killed in the process. In contrast, Africans were punished severely for attacking Indians. As late as 1750, reportedly more than 400 \\"ancient native\\" (or Settlement Indians) lived within South Carolina, with their \\"chief service\\" being \\"hunting Game, destroying Vermin and Beasts of Prey, and in capturing Runaway slaves.\\" During the Tuscarora War, the Cusabo joined the first South Carolina army under John Barnwell. They fought against the Tuscarora in North Carolina in 1711 and 1712. Part of the \\"Yamasee Company\\", the Cusabo troops numbered fewer than 15 men. In 1712, South Carolina granted Palawana Island, near Saint Helena Island, to the Cusabo, where many were already living. Barnwell took a census in early 1715 that listed the Cusabo (\\"Corsaboy\\") as living in five villages and having a population of 95 men and 200 women and children. The \\"Itwan\\", a Cusabo subtribe, was listed separately as living in one village with a population of 80 men and 160 women and children. During the Yamasee War of 1715, the Cusabo were one of the few Indian groups who sided with the colony of South Carolina. After the war, most of them migrated out of the area, joining either the Creek or Catawba to the west and south.

For 36 summers through 1963, they were among the most highly regarded summer camps. The camp colors were green and gold. History The brother- sister camps were located on Pattaquattic Pond (known to campers as Lake Aladdin); Mohican (boys) on the north shore and Reena (girls) on the south shore. Camp Mohican for Junior Gentlemen was founded by Rabbis Samuel Price and Morris Silverman in 1924. Rabbi Silverman was born in Newburgh, New York in 1894. He edited the High Holiday Prayer Book, popularly known as the \\"Silverman Machzor\\" in 1939 which became the official prayer book for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur for the United Synagogue of America of the Conservative Movement for over half a century. Before the start of the fourth season in 1928, they became associated with Mr. Emanuel Halpern, Mr. Benjamin Jaffe, and Mr. Joseph Deitch. The girl campers were called \\"Little Ladies of the Camp;\\" the girls camp was renamed Camp Reena prior to the 1928 season. After 1928, the ownership consisted of Anna and Benjamin Jaffe, Minna and Joseph Deitch, Celia and Sam Knoll, and Minnie and Emanuel Halpern. The owners were primarily educators, living and working in Jewish educational institutions in the Brooklyn and the Bronx Boroughs of New York City. Joseph Deitch was the principal of the Jacob H. Schiff Center of the Bronx for more than 25 years and principal of the Kingsbridge Heights Jewish Center. In 1952, the Deitch and Knoll families withdrew from ownership, selling their interests in Irving \\"Tarzan\\" Pearlman and Dr. Irving and Jackie Miller. Joe Deitch, beloved as \\"Uncle Joe,\\" continued as a director until suffering a heart attack just before the start of the 1962 season. The Millers apparently only lasted one season, selling their interest to Frank Salz, the longtime head counsellor of Mohican. Frank Salz, a counsellor at Mohican from 1928, was an All-American basketball player, a teacher at Brooklyn Technical High School, and president of the Athletic Coaches Association of Greater New York. Rickie Weiss, sister- in-law of the Halperns, served as Reena's head counsellor for many years through the summer of 1959, and was succeeded for four summers by Shirley Liebman. After the summer of 1958, the Halperns and Salz families sold their interests to Fern and Harold Fox of Woodmere, Long Island. The Halperns remained as directors through 1959, and Frank Salz continued as head counsellor of Mohican through 1960. Enrollment peaked at 400 campers in 1960, a large percentage of whom were children of campers and staff from the early years. As Harold Fox assumed control (Tarzan was largely responsible for buildings and grounds and the kitchen), long-term staff members departed and enrollment fell precipitously. Tarzan died during the summer of 1962, and his brother Max assumed his role in 1963. By 1963, enrollment had decreased to 150 campers and the facility had physically declined dramatically. After the 1963 season, the camps closed. The property was purchased by Camp Ramah, and continues as a religious summer camp to this day. At the end of every summer, trophies and cups were awarded to campers in such categories as Best Athlete and Best All Around Camper. Steven Gethers, an alumnus and Hollywood writer, dramatized the competition involved in the awarding these trophies in an episode of Playhouse 90 entitled Free Weekend, which was first aired on December 4, 1958. Guest stars included Kim Hunter, Martin Balsam, Charles Bickford, Jack Albertson, June Dayton, and Nancy Marchand. Although the camps have been closed for more than 50 years, the alumni association remains vibrant, sponsoring annual dinners in New York City and semiannual reunions in late August in Palmer.

History  Originally named AsianAvenue (or Asian Avenue), the site was launched on July 21, 1997 by co-founders Benjamin Sun, Peter Chen, Grace Chang, Michael Montero, and Calvin Wong. By 1998, The New York Times described it as \\"unusually successful\\" despite being \\"run out of an apartment\\", having hit five million page views from 50,000 users. Members were politically active, protesting an MSNBC headline for the 1998 Winter Olympics reading \\"American beats out Kwan\\", referring to U.S. Olympic teammates Tara Lipinski and Michelle Kwan. In 1999, members protested an ad for SKYY vodka showing a partly dressed white woman being served by a woman in a Mandarin dress and chopsticks in her hair, which the protesters said perpetuated racial stereotypes. After some 300 postings on Asian Avenue were forwarded to SKYY, the company agreed to stop using the ad. The site received over 70,000 unique visitor hits in August 2000. Mirrored on Community Connect website. At its peak, there were over 2 million users with more than 5000 online at any time. Robert X. Cringely claimed in 2000 that Asian Avenue had more members than BlackPlanet, a Community Connect sister site. Fine Line Features chose the site for an exclusive interview with Chinese NBA star Yao Ming to promote its documentary The Year of the Yao. One writer characterized it \\"mainly an Internet dating site\\" In 2003, Darrell Hamamoto used an interview on the site to attract male talent for his adult film Skin to Skin, using the \\"unheard of\\" pairing of an Asian-American male performer with Asian-American woman. At one point the site made various previously free features available only to premium users, which hurt the site's popularity. On October 31, 2005 the website relaunched the social network features. As of April 2007, there were 1.4 million registered users with fewer than 100 online at any given time. Partners include party promoters (Synergy), film festivals (Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival, Asian American International Film Festival), media (AngryAsianMan.com, AZN TV) and many more. Music artists, such as Notorious MSG, Far*East Movement, and Magnetic North have gained popularity from their exposure on AsianAve.com. In 2010, Monster.com announced a co- branded partnership with Asian Avenue. Based on a small questionnaire members filled out when signing up for a membership, Monster generated a list of potential job openings and interests, which was displayed after users signed into AsianAvenue.

His regnal name was \\"Tianhui\\" (Â§©ÊúÉ). During his reign, the Jin dynasty conquered the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. He then led the Jurchens in their campaigns against the Song dynasty, captured the Song capital in 1127 and went on to occupy most of northern China. After his death, he was posthumously honoured with the temple name Taizong by his successor, Emperor Xizong. Life Wuqimai was the fourth son of Helibo and his primary consort, Lady Nalan (ÊãèÊáíÊ∞è). He was a younger brother of Aguda (Emperor Taizu), the founder and first emperor of the Jin dynasty. He succeeded his brother in 1123. Two years later, the Jin general Wanyan Loushi (ÂÆåÈ°èÂ©ÅÂÆ§) led forces to attack the Khitan-led Liao dynasty and succeeded in capturing Emperor Tianzuo, the last Liao ruler, thereby ending the Liao dynasty's existence. In October 1125, Emperor Taizong waged war against the Han Chinese-led Song dynasty and ordered his fifth brother, Wanyan Gao (ÂÆåÈ°èÊù≤), to lead the Jin armies to attack Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng, Henan Province), the Song capital, from two different directions. The Song general Li Gang (ÊùéÁ∂±) led fierce resistance against the Jin invaders. After some time, the Jin and Song dynasties agreed to a truce. In August 1126, Emperor Taizong ordered Wanyan Zongwang (ÂÆåÈ°èÂÆóÊúõ) and Wanyan Zonghan to lead Jin forces to attack and besiege Bianjing again. This time, the Jin dynasty not only conquered Bianjing, but also captured Emperors Huizong and Qinzong of the Song dynasty. This event, historically known as the Jingkang Incident, marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty and beginning of the Southern Song dynasty. In 1128, Emperor Taizong gave ironic titles of nobility to the two captured former Song emperors; Emperor Huizong was called \\"Duke Hunde\\" (ÊòèÂæ∑ÂÖ¨; literally \\"Besotted Duke\\") while Emperor Qinzong was called \\"Marquis Chonghun\\" (ÈáçÊòè‰æØ; literally \\"Doubly Besotted Marquis\\"). They were resettled in Wuguocheng (‰∫îÂúãÂüé; in present-day Yilan County, Heilongjiang Province). During his reign, Emperor Taizong laid and strengthened the Jin dynasty's political system and institutions. In his later years, he designated Hela, a grandson of Aguda, as his successor. He died in Mingde Palace in 1135 and was buried in the He Mausoleum (ÂíåÈôµ). His descendants were massacred by Digunai (Prince of Hailing), the fourth ruler of the Jin dynasty, as a political move to eliminate possible contenders to the throne. His remains were relocated to Dafangshan (Â§ßÊàøÂ±±), which became known as the Gong Mausoleum (ÊÅ≠Èôµ).

He reigned for about 15 years from 1135 to 1150. During his reign, the Jin dynasty launched several military campaigns against the Han Chinese-led Southern Song dynasty in southern China. Early life Hela was the eldest son of Shengguo (Áπ©Êûú; also known as Wanyan Zongjun ÂÆåÈ°èÂÆóÂ≥ª), the eldest son of Aguda (Emperor Taizu), the founder and first emperor of the Jin dynasty. His mother was Lady Pucha (Ëí≤ÂØüÊ∞è), whom he posthumously honoured as \\"Empress Huizhao\\" (ÊÉ†Êò≠ÁöáÂêé). When Emperor Taizu died in 1123, the throne was passed on to his younger brother, Wuqimai (Emperor Taizong). Wanyan Zonghan and Wanyan Xiyin, who used to be Emperor Taizu's chief advisers, convinced Emperor Taizong to designate Hela as his heir apparent (anban bojilie; Ë´≥Áè≠ÂãÉÊ•µÁÉà) in 1132, so Hela became the new emperor in 1135 when Emperor Taizong died.Tao (1976), p. 37 Wars against the Southern Song dynasty In 1137, Emperor Xizong abolished the Qi kingdom, a vassal state of the Jin dynasty ruled by Liu Yu (ÂäâË±´), a former Song dynasty official. The Jin dynasty started peace negotiations with the Southern Song dynasty. In 1139, the Jin and Song dynasties arrived at a treaty, with the latter agreeing to be a tributary vassal state under the former. In return, the Jin dynasty returned control of Henan and Shaanxi provinces to the Song dynasty. However, in 1140, Emperor Xizong decided to wage war against the Song dynasty so he ordered the general Wanyan Zongbi to lead Jin forces to attack and seize back Henan and Shaanxi. In 1141, Wanyan Zongbi and his army were defeated by Song forces led by Yue Fei and Han Shizhong; the Jin dynasty agreed to negotiate for peace again with the Song dynasty. Internal politics Emperor Xizong was very fond of Han Chinese culture because of the influence of his adoptive father, Wanyan Zonggan (ÂÆåÈ°èÂÆóÂππ), so he reformed the political institutions and modelled them after Han Chinese ones, while at the same time encouraging talented Han Chinese to serve in his government. In 1136, Emperor Xizong ordered Wanyan Zonggan, Wanyan Zongpan (ÂÆåÈ°èÂÆóÁ£ê) and Wanyan Zonghan to take charge of reforming the government and creating the Three Departments system. Emperor Xizong abolished the traditional bojilie (ÂãÉÊ•µÁÉà) system that he inherited from his predecessors. The bojilie system allowed the Jurchen ruler to choose an heir apparent from among male relatives in the same generation as him, usually his brothers. However, Emperor Taizong, who succeeded his brother Emperor Taizu, made an exception when he chose Emperor Xizong (Emperor Taizu's grandson) as his heir apparent instead of choosing from among his sons. Wanyan Zongpan, the eldest son of Emperor Taizong, was very unhappy when the bojilie system was abolished because this meant that he would have no chance to become emperor. Between 1138 and 1139, Wanyan Zongpan tried to seize power and start a rebellion but was defeated and executed. Since then, the political arena was dominated by Wanyan Zonghan, Wanyan Zonggan and Wanyan Zongbi; Emperor Xizong had little or no say in politics. After Wanyan Zongbi died in 1148, Emperor Xizong gained an opportunity to participate in politics, but his wife, Lady Peiman (Empress Daoping), started to interfere in politics. Emperor Xizong's two sons, Wanyan Ji'an (ÂÆåÈ°èÊøüÂÆâ) and Wanyan Daoji (ÂÆåÈ°èÈÅìÊøü), died in 1143 and 1144 respectively. Emperor Xizong felt depressed by the loss of his sons that he developed an addiction to alcohol and started neglecting state affairs. He also became more violent and ruthless, and started killing people indiscriminately. One of his victims was Ambaghai, a Mongol chieftain and great-granduncle of Genghis Khan. Emperor Xizong was overthrown and murdered by his chancellor, Digunai, and other court officials in a coup d'√©tat on 9 January 1150.

Kickers was bought in 2007 by the Royer group.  History  On the French scene in 1970, Daniel Raufast came across a poster advertising the musical Hair. Interested by all the barefooted youngsters wearing jeans, he developed a new shoe concept which he believed to be more compatible with the blue-jean generation. The designer Jacques Chevallereau then created the first 'jean boot'. This new shoe was very different: the use of nubuck; shapes that looked more like short boots than regular shoes; tough crepe soles made with natural rubber, eyelets, contrast stitching, panels and appliqu√©s all obviously referencing denim. The success was such that, within one season, Kickers production capacity grew from 300 to 12,000 pairs per month. Immediately successful in France, then Germany, by 1974, Kickers were selling in over 70 countries. = United Kingdom = During the 1980s Kickers shoes became very successful in Britain. So much so in some case, children were queuing up until 10 o'clock at night waiting upon deliveries, and when the delivery did arrive the stock would be gone in a flash. Many children also collected the flower shape tag and did not believe the shoes were real Kickers unless this tag was included.BBC: I love 1980 TV programmes  Kick Hi  The Kick Hi boot was released in 1975.  Music industry popularity  It was in the late 1980s and early 1990s that Kickers really gained popularity when Kick His were heralded by icons on the Manchester music scene. The Kick Hi then became popular in the rave scene, first with acid house and then later with trance music. Many fans of the shoe came from diverse and contemporary musical backgrounds including UK garage, RnB, pop and hip hop.  Popular culture  Over the years, Kickers has been associated with the music industry, including Ms Dynamite, So Solid Crew, Jarvis Cocker, Noel Gallagher, Mike Skinner, Arctic Monkeys, Craig David and Rodney P. Ian Brown famously kicked off the trend by wearing a pair of Kick His to The Ha√ßienda as a cheeky retort to the strict 'no trainer policy'. The Stone Roses wore them in their video for 'Fools Gold'. A sheep sported a pair of Kick His on the cover of the 'Stepping Stone' 12-inch single by The Farm. Kickers sponsored the Urban Music Awards (UMA) 2007 and had an advertorial with NME which ended in September 2007.

Since inception, Kahramaa has operated as an independent corporation on a commercial basis with a total capital of eight billion Qatari riyals. Kahramaa is the sole transmission and distribution system owner and operator for the electricity and water sector in Qatar. History During Qatar's years as a British protectorate in the 20th century, water and electricity was regulated by the British under two separate entities known as the State Electricity Department and the State Water Department. After the British announced their plans of withdrawing from the country in 1968, the state established the Ministry of Electricity and Water to regulate its electricity and water needs. In July 2000, the Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa) was established by emiri decree in order to regulate and maintain the supply of water and electricity for the Qatari population. Operations In August 2015, the company announced that it would begin construction of Umm al Houl Power, a desalination and power plant in the south of the country. The plant started its operations from July 2018. The construction was estimated to cost around $2.75 billion and will have a capacity of 2520 MW and of potable water a day. Qatar's first major solar power plant was announced by Kahramaa in 2014, and is slated to begin operations by 2016. Its production capacity is expected to be 15 MW. In December 2015, the company stated that it had signed an agreement with Qatar Petroleum for cooperation in the development of solar power plants. Kahramaa would retain 60% ownership of the plants constructed under the agreement, while Qatar Petroleum would retain the remaining 40%. Electricity sector As of 2011, the electricity transmission networks consist of approximately 247 primary high voltage sub-stations. The network is coupled with 10500 low and medium voltage sub-stations (11 kV). Its voltage sub-stations are supported by a total 4000 km of overhead lines and of underground cables running across the country. The National Control Center manages all network demand and data acquisition from generation plants and primary sub-stations. =Electricity generation= Generation of electrical energy in Qatar has increased over the past fifty years; the maximum load over the network during the period from 1988 to 2003 has risen from 941 MW to 2,312 MW. It reached 3,230 MW in 2006. By 2011, it had increased to 6,518 MW. The company was producing around 8,600 MW by 2014; a 2,000 MW surplus when compared to the 6,600 MW of demand. =Electricity generation capacity= Kahramaa's electricity generation capacity was 28,144 GWh in 2010. This figure increased to 30,730 GWh in 2011 and 34,788 GWh in 2012 before dropping slightly, to 34,688 GWh in 2013. Another large expansion was recorded in 2014, when the electricity production capacity was raised to 38,963 GWh. Overall, from 2010 to 2014, Kahramaa's electricity generation capacity was increased at an average annual rate of around 10%. Water sector The water network in Qatar has been expanded extensively in recent years, the growth of urban areas; industry and agriculture has led to the increase in the length of the water network to and expansion in the number of storage reservoirs to 23 with a total capacity of of potable water a day. =Water capacities= Statistical data in the water sector shows a remarkable growth in the capacities of water storage facilities. Such an increase has amounted to a year in 2006, in comparison to less than in 1988. The annual water capacity was recorded as in 2009 and by 2014 had increased to . =Water quality= To ensure safe and clean drinking water to high standards and quality, water is subject to daily random bacteriological and laboratory tests undertaken by Kahramaa. Samples are collected and tested from the storage reservoirs and networks up to the customers' storage facilities.

It is in the civil parish of Eartham. This small parish on the South Downs consists of a small early Norman church and adjoining farmstead in an east-west aligned dry valley in the chalk. There are a few more houses at Benges where the A285 to Chichester leaves the valley. From Benges Hill the parish extends south as far as the disused Roman road of Stane Street, in an area of open access woodland. The barns at Upwaltham House Farm have been converted into a conference and wedding venue. The adjoining farmstead of Littleton Farm is only to the east in the same valley, but lies in Duncton parish. The land area of the parish is 494 hectares (1,221 acres), with a population in the 2001 census of 25 people living in 10 households. The church The early Norman church dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin is just over nine hundred years old, and remains little altered in size and structure, although the windows are not original, some being medieval and some Victorian. The three foot (90 cm) thick walls are of stone and downland flint. In Norman style the church has a tall narrow nave and a rounded apse chancel for the altar. The original round Norman chancel arch, between nave and chancel, was replaced after about 100 years by a wider pointed arch. The south door was rebuilt when the church was about 200 years old, and the porch in the nineteenth century. The floor tiling is Victorian. The stone font at the west end of the nave is as old as the church. In the chancel there is a piscina, a small sink for washing communion vessels, which appears to be made from a reused Norman column capital.The Corpus of Romanesque SculptureJeremy Godwin, The Church in the Field, A Guide to the Church 1991 (Available at the church) Parish records of births and deaths from 1592 are held by the West Sussex Record Office. The ecclesiastical parish is now jointly run with Tillington and Duncton, the Rector living at Tillington.
