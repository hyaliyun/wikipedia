The station itself is situated in Malaccan territory, being one of the only two stations on the West Coast Line that serves the state of Malacca, the other being Batang Melaka. The station is served by the KTM ETS, KTM Intercity and KTM Komuter's Seremban Line. The station is the southern terminus of the Seremban Line and the western terminus for Intercity services from JB Sentral. Naming dispute Initially, the station was named \\"Tampin railway station\\", despite the station being situated geographically in Pulau Sebang, and not Tampin. There was an unresolved dispute to what the railway station is named as. The people in Negeri Sembilan called the railway station \\"Tampin railway station\\" while the people in Malacca called it \\"Pulau Sebang railway station\\". KTM also confirmed that the railway station's name is \\"Tampin\\" not \\"Pulau Sebang\\". Even after a signboard that read \\"TAMPIN/PULAU SEBANG\\" was put up on the platforms the dispute was still ongoing. However, on 4 January 2013, KTM resolved the naming dispute by changing the station's name from just Tampin to Pulau Sebang/Tampin. History The station began operations on 15 July 1905 when construction of the West Coast Line reached Tampin from Seremban. Later on 1 December 1905, the Tampin-Melaka Line was opened. The main trunk line to Gemas was only opened about a year later on 1 October 1906. The Tampin-Melaka Line was later dismantled by the Japanese in World War II.https://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/we-can-revive-tampin-malacca-rail- service On October 10, 2015, KTM Komuter introduced a new route, a shuttle service between Seremban-Sebang/Tampin-Gemas station.https://www.bharian.com.my/node/85731https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/410837 Southbound Komuter passengers (from Kuala Lumpur) will have to alight at Seremban station, and wait for the shuttle train services to Pulau Sebang/Tampin or Gemas. The shuttle service was cut short on 20 June 2016 to Pulau Sebang/Tampin, removing both Batang Melaka and Gemas from the line. This system operated until 11 July 2016, when the Seremban Line was extended to Pulau Sebang/Tampin, effectively replacing the shuttle service with the Komuter line. The station is the starting point of KTM Intercity's Ekspres Selatan Line, which terminates at Johor Bahru Sentral station. The station is also the third last stop of the KTM ETS line, before it terminates at Gemas station.

In the 20th century, longtime directors Robert Forrer and Jean-Jacques Hatt worked on the systematic study of the Alsatian ground and the substantial enlargement of the collection. Between 1988 and 1992, the mus√©e was thoroughly renovated. Its collections continue to grow steadily due to the numerous excavations made in and around Strasbourg since the beginning of the construction of the new Tramway network.

In 2004 she shared the Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award with Mary Robinson.  Background  Central library University of San Carlos Guatemala.Sebastian Oliva, 2006.Trujillo was born in Ciudad Flores, Pet√©n, Guatemala in 1943. She graduated in law from University of San Carlos of Guatemala in 1970. Many of her early cases involved domestic violence. After being appointed Professor of Family Law at the University of San Carlos she lectured for eight years in family law and on the need for law to provide legal protection for women and their children. In 1991 she was appointed a delegate to the National Women‚Äôs Office (ONAM). In 1993 after the coup d‚Äôetat, she was appointed Vice Minister for Work and Social Security, helping to establish the Unit for the Promotion of Women Workers. In 1994 Trujillo was involved in petitioning the Guatemalan state to ratify the Inter-American Convention for the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women. In 1996 she helped pass a law for the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Domestic Violence. In 1997 as part of the Network against Violence against Women (Red de la No Violencia contra Mujeres) Tujillo authored a report on the family courts refusal to apply the Law for the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Domestic Violence. Her findings and recommendations were approved in 2000, establishing the National Commission for the Prevention of Domestic Violence (CONAPREVI).  Campaign against rape and murder of women and children  Trujillo's primary concern is preventing more examples of the thousands of women who have been raped and then murdered, often in an horrific manner, over the last decade. In 2009, the Amnesty International report on human rights violations in Guatemala included this section on violence against women and children (the core area of Trujillo's work): \\"The police reported that 687 women were the victims of homicide in 2008; their bodies frequently showed signs of rape and other torture. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported in January that discriminatory practices by the authorities persisted, resulting in a failure to investigate killings of women and a tendency to blame the victim. In April, Congress passed a new Law Against Femicide. The law received a mixed response from civil society organizations.\\" The violence has been referred to by Trujillo as \\"femicidio\\".

Having lost his scholarship on a technicality, Ruben resorts to burglary at his father's house in order to cover his educational expenses. What ensues is a comedic overly choreographed fight-scene complete with wire work and overdone martial arts action. Shona (Michelle Bayle) leaves her daughter and her boyfriend Mando (played by Diether Ocampo) in order to return to work in Japan as an exotic dancer. Her predicament exemplifies the situation of every Filipino person who has come to the realization that life in the Philippines often does not allow the working person to earn money enough to save for a better living. Cher (Baron Geisler) is a drag queen who, because of her sexuality, becomes the victim of violent homophobic aggression. His performance, while exaggeratedly comic, touches on the ugliness of homophobia and sexual discrimination. And yet the issue is never resolved, because Cher‚Äôs attackers are not punished for their hate crime. Neither is Shona condemned for abandoning her child in this instance of labor export from the Philippines, and the effects that it has on the people who must be left. Ruben‚Äôs moral and practical dilemma remains unresolved as well. The lives of three couples: Iza (Assunta de Rossi) and I√±igo (Dominic Ochoa), Kulas (Vhong Navarro) and Joan (Julia Clarete), and Dino (Patrick Garcia) and Faith (Jodi Sta. Maria) deal with objectification, unrequited love, and first sexual experiences, respectively.

During the Third English Civil War, as Lord Mayor of London, he made sure that there was no trouble in London. During the Interregnum he supported Oliver Cromwell, and was knighted by him in 1657.McIntosh, ODNBNoble, pp. 81,82 Many sources confuse him with another Thomas Andrewes, who had a more prominent role in the British East India Company and was a contemporary of the London politician; this other Andrewes was still alive in 1660.Elliot, pp. 129-131 Life In the 1620s Andrewes followed the lead of his father Robert and traded with the Plymouth Colony. During the 1630s he traded with the New England colonies, and as a member of the guild of the Leathersellers' Company, ran a successful wholesale linen drapery business at the White Lion, Fish Street Hill.Brenner, p. 422 By the end of the decade he had been the master of the guild (from 1638 to 1639), and had made enough money to be become an undersharer holder in a syndicate that farmed customs (a speculative venture where the syndicate paid the Crown a fixed sum against the hope of collecting a larger sum from those who owed custom revenue to the Crown). Andrewes was a devout Puritan who in the late 1630s followed Sydrach Simpson to Rotterdam to join his congregation. When Simpson first returned to London his congregation met at Andrewes' house. During the 1640s Andrewes continued to develop his businesses linked to foreign trade. He was involved in trade in the Caribbean, and with Maurice Thompson and Samuel Moyer he financed trading ventures with west Africa.Brenner, p. 139 footnote 83 for a list of sources. In 1642 at the start of the Civil War Andrewes was a member of the committee which oversaw the City of London militia, a body of men willing to defend London against the Cavaliers (see for example the Battle of Turnham Green).Brenner, p. 513 It was also during 1642 that he became an Alderman of the City and a Sheriff of London. Thanks to his financial success, he was able to lend large sums to help parliament finance the war, and involved himself in the financial administration of the parliamentary cause. Between 1642 and 1645 he took on many treasurerships for the army and parliament. Two of the more significant were commissioner for the customs (appointed 1643), and, in 1645, one of the treasurers for war. Mark Noble notes that these treasury positions were very lucrative and states that as Treasurer of the money and plate sent to Guildhall, he and Lord Say and Sele obtained very large sums, and as Treasurer at War his salary was three-pence in the pound. For his own financial benefit and to improve his social status he purchased lands sequestrated by parliament from bishops. In 1647 Andrewes was appointed to the new militia committee which oversaw new militia set up under the auspices of the New Model Army. In 1648 he supported Pride's Purge and the other moves made by the Grandees in the New Model Army. Andrewes sat as a commissioner at the trial of Charles I in January 1649. He attended the trial in Westminster Hall on 2 and 23 January, and on the 27th he, along with the other commissioners present, stood up to indicate his assent to the death sentence. He did not sign the warrant, but was present at King Charles I's execution on 30 January 1649, and in March, when the Rump Parliament passed the Act abolishing the Office of King, he was responsible for proclaiming the abolition of monarchy in the City of London.Plant, David. Isaac Penington, regicide, 1602-67Full text of the Act abolishing the Office of King, 17 March, 1649 In April that year Andrewes was appointed to succeed Abraham Reynardson, the Royalist Lord Mayor of London, on the latter's deposition in April 1649. Having served until the following October, he was, after a year's interval, again chosen for the year 1650‚Äì1651.\\"In one instance only before the fourth decade of the 17th century did a Lord Mayor-elect (or about to be elected), who was not already enrolled in one of the great Companies, fail to translate himself ([immediately enrol in one of the great Livery Companies]). This was Thomas Andrewes, ..., who was appointed to succeed Abraham Reynardson, the Royalist Lord Mayor, on the latter's deposition in April, 1649, and having served till the following October, was, after a year's interval, again chosen for the year 1650‚Äì1651. I know of no explanation of the non-observance of the rule in his case, and can only suggest that it was one of the many irregularities of the troubled period of the Commonwealth.\\" (Beavan p. 832) His successful performance of his duties during his second period as Lord Mayor was of importance to the Commonwealth as he was responsible for keeping the capital quiet, and a bulwark against any resurgence of Royalism in support of the King Chales II during the third English Civil War. Noble asserts that Andrewes fell out with Oliver Cromwell over Cromwell becoming Lord Protector, and by presenting a petition, of a dangerous nature, he fell under the displeasure of the Protector Oliver. However in the much more modern Oxford Dictionary of National Biography A. W. McIntosh states that \\"he was a firm supporter of Oliver Cromwell and republicanism in the moderate City government in the fifties[, and] was knighted by Cromwell in 1657\\". In the 1650s Andrewes continued a successful business career. In 1657 he became deputy governor of the East India Company and may have been its governor in 1659.Elliot He also acquired more sequestered properties including Mucking Hall in Essex. There is no record of the place and date of his death, but he was buried on 20 August 1659. A year later the political landscape had changed and the monarchy had been restored. Under Section XXXVIII of the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, he, like the other dead regicides, was not exempted from the general pardon so that his property could be sequestrated by the state. According to Noble \\"To the Royalists he was peculiarly obnoxious, as one of the High Court of Justice, where he had assisted in the condemnation of other illustrious characters, besides the unhappy monarch. ... Had he lived to have seen the return of his banished Sovereign, he would either have expiated his crime by an ignominious and painful death, or spent the remainder of his life in poverty and imprisonment.\\" Family Thomas Andrewes was the son of Robert Andrewes of Feltham, Middlesex, and Margaret, his wife. Robert was a Plymouth merchant and a subscriber to the Massachusetts Bay Company. Thomas married Eleanor, daughter of Henry Bonwick of Horsley in Surrey. They had a number of children, of which five survived them: four sons and a daughter.Brenner, p. 139 Notes References * Beaven, Alfred P. (1908), The Aldermen of the City of London *Brenner, Robert.

It was the second of three monumental illustrated works dealing with the avifauna of the continent and was published midway between the other two, the first being Gould's identically titled The Birds of Australia (1840-1848), and the third the Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds (1990-2006). History It was sponsored and authored by wealthy Australia amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews, with considerable assistance from his collaborator and private secretary Tom Iredale, and was published by H. F. & G. Witherby of London over a 17-year period from 1910 to 1927. The text and plates, comprising 12 volumes, were issued serially in 75 parts in royal quarto format in an edition of 225 numbered copies.Stone (1927). The five supplements issued at various times during the long publication period fill a 13th, supplementary, volume; the first three supplements comprising the Check-List of Australian Birds, and the last two the Bibliography of the Birds of Australia. When the publication was complete it was reviewed in the RAOU journal The Emu by J. A. Leach (as J.A.L.) who wrote: > \\"In these twelve splendid volumes, Mr Mathews has stressed largely the > nomenclatural aspect, a phase of ornithology which received little attention > from John Gould in the eight folio volumes of his highly valued work, The > Birds of Australia. Gould seldom listed a date, and therefore he failed to > recognize occasionally that another name listed by him was really older than > the name used by him. He was a firm believer in the use of the prior name; > this he showed by changing when necessary to an older name. These two great > ornithological works which have the same title, and of which Australians are > justly proud are thus complementary. Gould emphasized the field and natural > history sides, while Mathews stressed the academic and nomenclatural > aspects. An Australian student having the use of these fine volumes is well > equipped with material on which to base future studies.\\"J.A.L. (1928). Mathews‚Äô approach to nomenclature was controversial and not always consistent. In a review in the AOU journal The Auk, the editor Witmer Stone comments: > \\"It is interesting in view of Mr Mathews's many discussions of nomenclature > to see how his attitude on certain points changed as his work progressed. In > the opening volume he congratulates the authorities of the British Museum > upon their intention of ignoring many of the \\"useless generic names\\" of the > late Dr Bowdler Sharpe and yet in a few years we see Mr Mathews as one of > the most extreme genus splitters that ornithology has known. So again in > spite of his vigorous plea for the universal use of subspecies we find him, > by the time Vol. V is reached, refusing to give them the full recognition in > the text that they had previously received and simply discussing them at the > end of each species. And what is far worse placing them in the synonymy > where they cannot be distinguished from the real synonyms. The number and > treatment of subspecies however are ornithological problems, always subject > to personal opinion, with no possible \\"code\\" to govern them. > \\"We have felt that the great amount of space devoted to nomenclatural > discussion in the 'Birds of Australia' was unfortunate as most of the facts > could usually have been stated without nearly so much verbiage and often the > very fact that the author was endeavoring to bring out has been obscured by > useless repetition. It seems as if some parts of the text may have been > printed from a hastily prepared manuscript without revision. We have > discussed Mr Mathews‚Äô great work from a nomenclatural point of view because > that seems to have been the author's chief concern in its production and > that is the feature that will be remembered in the future. He has, however, > collected a great deal of valuable and interesting data on the lives and > habits of the birds but as he tells us the adequate life histories of the > Australian birds are yet to be written and his aim has been to clear away > the technical difficulties in Australian ornithology and set up the species > and their names on a permanent basis. This we feel that he has done or at > least has presented all of the necessary information on the subject, an > achievement of which he may well be proud.\\" Lipoa ocellata (malleefowl) from Volume I. Keulemans As well as the extensive scientific text, in which Mathews described several new species and subspecies, the 12 volumes are illustrated with some 600 hand-coloured lithographed plates by J.G. Keulemans (who completed 163 illustrations for the first four volumes before his death on 29 March 1912), H. Gr√∂nvold, Roland Green, Herbert Goodchild and G.E. Lodge. Stone commented on the plates by saying that as artistic productions they could not be compared with the great folios of John Gould, though those by Keulemans were probably the best. Associated works After completing the publication of the 12 volumes, in 1928 Mathews produced The Birds of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands and the Australian South Polar Quadrant, in the same format and with the same publisher, containing 45 lithographic plates. It was followed in 1936 by A Supplement to the Birds of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands to which is Added those Birds of New Zealand not figured by Buller, containing 57 plates. Although not technically part of The Birds of Australia, these two volumes extend its coverage to Australia's Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea, and even attempt to fill in the gaps left in Walter Buller‚Äôs coverage of New Zealand in his similarly ambitious A History of the Birds of New Zealand (1872-1873, 2nd edition 1887-1888).Robin (2001), pp.59-60.

It is named after Heinrich Edmund Naumann who discovered the first fossils at Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan. Description Nojiri Lake Museum of Naumann Elephant Palaeoloxodon naumanni, like other members of the genus Palaeoloxodon, is more closely related to African elephants than Asian elephants and Mammoths. Similar to mammoths P. naumanni had a subcutaneous fat layer and long fur as an adaption to a cold environment. The species had a pair of long twisted tusks and a bulge on the head. These tusks grew more than 2.4 m in length, 20 cm in diameter. It was a little smaller than Asian elephants averaging to . It lived in forest which mixed subarctic conifers and cool-temperate deciduous trees. The ancestor of Palaeoloxodon naumanni moved from the Eurasian continent to Japan via a land bridge; it subsequently evolved independently and spread throughout Japan after the land bridge was covered by rising seawaters. Palaeoloxodon naumanni was hunted by the inhabitants of the time. Some fossils were found around Lake Nojiri in Nagano Prefecture, together with many lithic and bone tool artifacts. The range of P. naumanni extends across the Japanese archipelago, north to Hokkaido, where during the Late Pleistocene it alternated with the woolly mammoth during warmer intervals. Discovery and nomenclature In 1860, the first fossil record was found at Yokosuka and the bottom of Seto Inland Sea, Japan. Heinrich Edmund Naumann researched and reported these fossils in ‚ÄúUeber japanische Elephanten der Vorzeit‚Äù (1882). Naumann classified the fossil as Elephas namadicus Falconer & Cautley. In 1924, researched fossils which were found in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka and reported the elephant was a new subspecies and deseignated the fossil Elephas namadicus naumannni in ‚ÄúNotes on a fossil elephant from Sahamma, Totomi‚Äù (1924). Tadao Kamei identified Elephas namadicus naumanni as a new species, called Palaeoloxodon naumanni, from fossils found at Lake Nojiri. It has also been called Elephas naumanni.  Evolution and extinction  The oldest known dates for the species are from MIS 12, around 430 kya, where it replaces Stegodon orientalis, which had arrived from mainland East Asia several hundred thousand years prior. The youngest dates for the species are around 24 kyr Before Present, during the early stages of the Last Glacial Maximum. Any younger dates were considered unreliable.

It was derived from engines and design work carried out at BMW in Germany during World War II, and extensively developed though a progression of more powerful models. The name is derived from its original design group, Atelier Technique A√©ronautique de Rickenbach employing Hermann √ñstrich and many of the wartime BMW gas turbine design group as well as other German engine design teams. The ATAR 101 powered many of the French post-war jet aircraft, including the Vautour II, √âtendard IV, Super Myst√®re B2, and the Mirage III-001, prototype of the Mirage III series.Gunston 1989, p. 160. Design and development At the end of World War II the French aircraft industry was in disarray, having been commandeered by the German government to produce mostly German designed aircraft and aero-engines. To develop an indigenous gas turbine aero-engine the French government acquired the services of a large contingent of German design engineers and technicians. Some of these engineers formed the Atelier Technique A√©ronautique de Rickenbach, led by Dr. Hermann √ñstrich who had been developing gas turbine engines at BMW. By September the team was housed at the Dornier factory at Rickenbach near Lindau on Lake Constance and had largely completed design of the ATAR 101 by October 1945. A contract for development of the engine was awarded in December 1945, a stipulation being that all manufacturing was to be carried out in France. Communications between the ATAR group and SNECMA, the newly formed Nationalised engine manufacturer, proved to be difficult and the design team soon moved to Decize on the River Loire, to improve communications with SNECMA and was renamed Aeroplanes G.Voisin, Groupe 'O' . Manufacture of components for the ATAR 101 V1 commenced at SNECMA plants in May 1946 and the first run was carried out on 26 March 1948. The early engines were constructed from ordinary commercial steels and suffered from very short running lives, not achieving a 150-hour endurance test until 1951. As more exotic materials were introduced the durability and reliability of test engines improved dramatically and on 10 November 1950 the first flight-ready ATAR 101A flew in the fuselage of a Martin B-26G Marauder (F-WBXM). Steady progress was made by Groupe O, but they were soon absorbed into SNECMA during a massive re- organisation of the nationalised giant in June 1950. Other aircraft joined the flight test program, including two SNCASE S.E.161 Languedoc airliners, a SNCASO S.O.30P Bretagne (F-WAYD), SNCASE S.E.2060 Armagnac and a Gloster Meteor F.4 (RA491). The ATAR 101 was steadily developed with improvements to materials, aerodynamic design, compressors, combustion chambers and turbines resulting in the first commercially viable engine, the ATAR 101B, which, along with later marques, powered the SNCASO S.O.4050 Vautour interceptor/bomber/reconnaissance aircraft. Improved marques continued to be developed throughout the 1950s culminating in the 101G with after-burning laying the ground work for the later ATAR 8 and ATAR 9.

Striking at 11:02 am on November 9, it measured 5.4 on the Richter scale. Although no fatalities occurred, the event caused considerable structural damage to buildings, including the toppling of chimneys and shaking in Chicago, the region's largest city. The earthquake was one of the most widely felt in U.S. history, largely affecting 23 states over an area of . In studying its cause, scientists discovered the Cottage Grove Fault in the Southern Illinois Basin. Within the region, millions felt the rupture. Reactions to the earthquake varied; some people near the epicenter did not react to the shaking, while others panicked. A future earthquake in the region is extremely likely; in 2005, seismologists and geologists estimated a 90% chance of a magnitude 6‚Äì7 tremor before 2055, likely originating in the Wabash Valley seismic zone on the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana border or the New Madrid fault zone.  Background  The first recorded Illinois earthquake is from 1795, when a small earthquake shook the frontier settlement of Kaskaskia. Data from large earthquakes‚Äîin May and July 1909, and November 1968‚Äîsuggest that earthquakes in the area are of moderate magnitude but can be felt over a large geographical area, largely because of the lack of fault lines. The May 1909 Aurora earthquake affected people in an area of ; the 1968 Illinois earthquake was felt by those living in an area of about . Contradicting the idea that the region's earthquakes are felt over a wide area, a 1965 shock was only noticed near Tamms, though it had the same intensity level (VII) as those of 1909 and 1968. Before 1968, earthquakes had been recorded in 1838, 1857, 1876, 1881, 1882, 1883, 1887, 1891, 1903, 1905, 1912, 1917, 1922, 1934, 1939, 1947, 1953, 1955, and 1958. Since 1968, other earthquakes have occurred in the same region in 1972, 1974, 1984, and 2008.  Geology  alt=Jutting off the Wabash Valley seismic zone on the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana border is the Cottage Grove Fault. To the south, on the edge of Missouri, is the New Madrid seismic zone. The quake struck on Saturday, November 9, 1968, at 11:02 am. The quake's epicenter was slightly northwest of Broughton in Hamilton County, and close to the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana border, about east of St. Louis, Missouri. Surrounding the epicenter were several small towns built on flat glacial lake plains and low hills. (See this bulletin on the webpage of Earthquake Center of Saint Louis University) Scientists described the rupture as \\"strong\\". During the quake, surface wave and body wave magnitudes were measured at 5.2 and 5.54, respectively. The magnitude of the quake reached 5.4 on the Richter scale. The earthquake occurred at a depth of . A fault plane solution for the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes (one is always a fault plane, the other an auxiliary plane) striking north‚Äìsouth and dipping about 45¬∞ to the east and to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion and a horizontal east‚Äìwest axis of confining stress. At the time of the earthquake, no faults were known in the immediate epicentral region (see below), but the motion corresponded to movement along the Wabash Valley Fault System roughly east of the region. The rupture also partly occurred on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812. The New Madrid tremors were the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States. Various theories were put forward for the cause of the rupture. Donald Roll, director of seismology at Loyola University Chicago, proposed that the quake was caused by massive amounts of silt being deposited by rivers, generating a \\"seesaw\\" effect on the plates beneath. \\"The weight of the silt depressed one end of the block and tipped up the other,\\" he said. Scientists eventually realized, though, that the cause was a then-unknown fault, the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth's rock in the Southern Illinois Basin near the city of Harrisburg, Illinois. The fault, which is aligned east-west, is connected to the north-south-trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists revealed monoclines, anticlines, and synclines, all of which suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era, when strike-slip faulting took place nearby. The fault runs along an ancient Precambrian terrane boundary. It was active mainly in the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian epochs around 300 million years ago.  Damage  The alt=Full-view photograph of the arch The earthquake was felt in 23 states and affected a zone of . The shaking extended east to Pennsylvania and West Virginia, south to Mississippi and Alabama, north to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and west to Oklahoma. Isolated reports were received from Boston, Mobile, Alabama, Pensacola, Florida, southern Ontario, Arkansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Mississippi, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama, Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, presumably because of shaking. The worst-affected areas were in the general area of Evansville, Indiana, St. Louis, and Chicago, but with no major damage. No deaths happened; the worst injury was a child knocked unconscious by falling debris outside his home. Damage was confined to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south- central Iowa, and largely consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed parapets, and overturned tombstones. In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection, which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) took place in the Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects, including cars, chimneys, and the Gateway Arch, were reported to authorities. McLeansboro in particular experienced minor damage over an extensive area. Its local high school reported 19 broken windows in the girls' gymnasium, along with cracked plaster walls. Most of the high school's classrooms sustained fractured walls. The fa√ßade of the town's First United Methodist Church was damaged, and a brick and concrete block fell off the top. The Hamilton County Courthouse withstood several structural cracks, including one on the ceiling above the judge's seat. The town's residents also reported collapsing chimneys; three chimneys toppled at one home, leading to further damage. Most of the buildings that experienced chimney damage were 30 to 50 years old. The City Building in Henderson, Kentucky, east-southeast of the epicenter, sustained considerable structural damage. Moderate damage‚Äîincluding broken chimneys and fractured walls‚Äîoccurred in towns in south-central Illinois, southwest Indiana, and northwest Kentucky. For instance, a concrete-brick cistern caved in west of Dale. In Lineville, Iowa, about south of Des Moines on the Missouri border, the quake was felt as a long shaking. The quake damaged the town's water tower, which began to leak of water an hour.Times-Republican Newspaper; Corydon, Iowa; November 14, 1968 Donald Roll correctly predicted the earthquake would have no aftershocks. He later said, \\"That was kind of a safety valve. The pressure [that] has been built up has been released.\\" He also described the earthquake as \\"a very rare occurrence\\".  Response  Millions in the area experienced the earthquake, the first major seismic event in decades. Following the tremor, businesses in the area emptied. Many residents did not believe that the earthquake was over magnitude 5. Others did not realize an earthquake was taking place, for example, some residents thought their furnaces had exploded, and one man thought that the shaking was caused by his son \\"jumping up and down\\". At the Suntone Factory in McLeansboro, from the epicenter, workers rushed out of the building, thinking a water tank inside had fallen. People's reactions varied; some described themselves as \\"shocked\\"; others admitted to being \\"shaky\\" or nervous for the rest of the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, \\"I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving.\\" One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a \\"bomb\\". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, \\"I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared.\\" People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was \\"in a car ... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there\\".  Future threats  In 2005, scientists determined s a 90% probability existed of a magnitude 6‚Äì7 earthquake occurring in the New Madrid area during the next 50 years. This could cause potentially high damage in the Chicago metropolitan area, which has a population near 10 million people. Pressure on the fault where the 1811-1812 Madrid earthquakes occurred was believed to be increasing, but a later study by Eric Calais of Purdue University and other experts concluded the land adjacent to the New Madrid fault was moving less than a year, increasing the span between expected earthquakes on the fault to 500-1,000 years. Scientists anticipating a future earthquake suggest the Wabash Valley Fault as a possible source, calling it \\"dangerous\\". Douglas Wiens, a professor of earth and planetary sciences, reported: \\"The strongest earthquakes in the last few years have come from the Wabash Valley Fault\\", and said the fault needs more scientific observation. Steven Obermeir of the United States Geological Survey is one of several scientists who have found sediments suggesting Wabash Valley Fault earthquakes around magnitude 7 on the Richter scale. Michael Wyssession, an associate professor of earth and planetary sciences, denigrated the Madrid fault zone and said, \\"in 20 years there have been three magnitude 5 or better earthquakes on the Wabash Valley Fault. There is evidence that sometime in the past, the Wabash Valley Fault has produced as strong as magnitude 7 earthquakes. On the other hand, the New Madrid Fault has been very quiet for a long time now. Clearly, the Wabash Valley Fault has gotten our deserved attention.\\"  See also  *List of earthquakes in 1968 *List of earthquakes in Illinois  Notes  * Two earthquakes occurred during this year. * Three earthquakes took place during this year. * From other sources, the focal depth was 12 mi (19 km).

The album reached #15 on the New Zealand music charts.  Background  According to Finn, the idea of releasing a compilation album came from John O'Donnell, the head of EMI Australia at the time. \\"It was his baby. He likes my work and it was his suggestion that we create an anthology.

Finn noted that the retrospective does not signal the end of his career, as he plans on releasing new material in the future.  Critical reception  Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald wrote that some of the 1980s songs on the compilation have not aged well, but that the later material \\"holds up better.\\" Baillie complimented \\"How Will You Go\\" amongst the revised songs, and said that the anthology \\"remains a fascinating map charting just how far this Finn has sailed.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic suggested that the album does not portray a completely accurate summary of Finn's career, as the combination of new songs and revisions ends up \\"downplaying the progressive pop of the '70s and the new wave leanings of the '80s.\\" Still, Erlewine concluded, the compilation \\"does make a case that Finn has been consistently delivering fine songs for over 30 years.\\" Graham Reid similarly noticed some unusual omissions from the Split Enz era.

The Times of India gave the film 2.5 rating out of 5 and said \\"All-in-all, 'TONY' tries, but fails to delve deep into the mind-set of a serial killer and turn it into a gripping murder mystery- psychological thriller. If you are a hunter of good content (and good content alone), go‚Ä¶ scout for Tony!\\" Australian film blogger and indie film critic Richard Gary said \\"The film reminds me more of the crime shows that have been come out on cable from Europe recently, such as 'Ultraviolet' and 'The Valhalla Murders.' The moments of time stretching are definitely there, but overall, this is still a taut thriller, especially once you pass the 45-minute mark. While the ending I thought up was pretty good but not realized, this still passes the biting the fingernail test (figuratively, not literally).\\" FilmInk, a prominent Australian Film news website too gave a positive review to the film. \\"a dense tapestry that manages to engage and unsettle from end to end, with nary a dead spot in sight\\" said the website.

About LeFlore From 1968 through 1980, the school was known as Toulminville High School, offering secondary education to upper-middle class students within the Toulminville suburb. In 1981 the school was renamed John L. LeFlore High School in honor of John L. LeFlore, a civil rights activist, husband of Teah Beck, and Mobile NAACP leader elected to the legislature in Mobile County. The renaming of the school brought about a move into an authentic building with the amenities that would equip the institution for the upcoming magnet program. It was not until the mid-1980s that the learning institution gained a magnet program and changed the name to John L. LeFlore Magnet High School of Advanced Communication & Fine Arts. LeFlore is the only school in the Mobile County Public School System divided into two schools: comprehensive and magnet. The comprehensive school is exclusively for students zoned in LeFlore's school district, while the magnet school is dedicated to students who matriculated from middle magnet schools or are newly accepted applicants into the magnet program. Middle magnet schools that matriculate students to LeFlore include Clark-Shaw Magnet School, Paul Laurence Dunbar Magnet School, and Phillips Preparatory. LeFlore requires students, whether comprehensive or magnet, to adhere and highly perform to the rigorous curriculum, and to adhere to the uniform code implemented by Mobile County Public School System in 1995. Aside from the school's curriculum and performing arts, LeFlore is also known for its Mighty Marching Rattler Band, which is influenced in musical style and marching precision by Jackson State's \\"Sonic Boom of the South\\", Florida A&M;'s \\"Marching 100\\" and Southern University's \\"Human Jukebox Band\\".

Route Access to the pass is by a fairly steep dirt road into the Umkomaas Valley that continues to a bridge that crosses the Umkomaas River at an altitude of 548m. The pass rises by 651m over 7,19 km to reach the summit at an altitude of 1199m. There are gradients of 1:6 on certain sections of the pass which make it treacherous when wet. In dry conditions though, the pass can be driven with an ordinary road vehicle as the hard-packed gravel - although rough - provides good grip. Origin of the Name There are several versions of the origins of the name of the pass, the most plausible being that due to thick impenetrable bush in the area, the local herders cut a pathway to the grasslands at the top, but this pathway was so narrow that they had to walk in single file.

Its failure discredited the monarchy and contributed decisively to the establishment of the Second Hellenic Republic in March 1924.  Background  Following the Greek defeat in the Asia Minor Campaign against Turkey, the Greek Army, led by Venizelist Colonels Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas, overthrew the royalist government in September 1922 and forced King Constantine I into renewed exile. His eldest son, George II succeeded him, but the position of the monarchy remained precarious. The military-led \\"Revolutionary Government\\" tried and convicted six leading royalists to death as scapegoats for the country's military defeat, and gradually steered the country in the direction of a republic. On 18 October 1923, the Revolutionary Government proclaimed elections to be held on 16 December for a National Assembly which would decide on the country's future form of government. The Revolutionary Government however, headed by Gonatas, had passed an electoral law which heavily favoured the Venizelist Liberal Party and the other anti-monarchist parties. The prospect of the elections and an almost-certain regime change led to the creation of a heterogeneous coalition in the ranks of the army, which aimed to overthrow the government. Its main driving force was the so-called \\"Majors' Organization\\" (ŒüœÅŒ≥Œ¨ŒΩœâœÉŒ∑ Œ§Œ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±œÅœáœéŒΩ) of royalist middle-ranking officers, which was in close contact with the royalist former Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff and future dictator, General Ioannis Metaxas, but several disgruntled Venizelists, most prominently Leonardopoulos and Gargalidis, also joined. The conspirators managed to win over the bulk of the military units in northern Greece and the Peloponnese, but failed to make inroads in the garrisons of Athens, Thessaloniki or the other major cities, as well as in the overwhelmingly Venizelist Navy.  The coup attempt  Metaxas had advised that the coup should take place in Athens, the country's nerve centre, but in the event, it was launched in the provinces in the early hours of 22 October. In its initial stages it proved rapidly successful: by the morning, in the entire Greek mainland, only the cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, Larissa and Ioannina remained under government control. The government was initially caught by surprise but soon rallied. General Theodoros Pangalos, the head of the Army, launched energetic countermeasures, while the putschists prevaricated. In Thessaloniki, Venizelist officers led by General Georgios Kondylis preempted the coup from taking over the city, and subsequently confronted the rebel forces under Colonel Ziras. The government forces prevailed and reestablished control over northern Greece by October 25, while Ziras himself fled to Yugoslavia. In the Peloponnese, Leonardopoulos and Gargalidis with their troops crossed the Isthmus of Corinth and marched towards Athens, but were surrounded by government troops and forced to surrender unconditionally on 27 October.  Aftermath  The failed coup was a turning point in Greek history, as the royalist cause was comprehensively defeated, at least for the moment. In the coup's aftermath, the royalist faction lost in influence and was effectively decapitated. More than 1200 royalist officers were dismissed from the Armed Forces. Leonardopoulos and Gargalidis were court-martialled and sentenced to death, although they were eventually pardoned. Ioannis Metaxas, who was in Corinth at the time of the coup, managed to flee the country and went to exile in Italy. The royalist parties abstained from the December elections, paving the way for the electoral triumph of the Venizelist parties. King George II left the country on 19 December, and on 25 March 1924, a presidential Republic was proclaimed. Its short existence would be troubled by coups and counter-coups amidst the ever-continuing conflict between Venizelists and royalists, until the restoration of monarchy in yet another coup in October 1935.

History Foundation The idea to establish the committee was finally fulfilled on 19 May 1979 as it became the official organization supervising sport activities in Bahrain and under the Supreme Council for Youth and Sports, which was founded in 1975, presided by the then Crown Prince His Majesty King Hamad. And following the constituent meeting on 19 May 1979, in the presence of representatives of nine sports associations ‚Äì athletics, swimming, football, basketball, volleyball, handball, weightlifting, table tennis and shooting, the main system of the committee was formed and submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, which was then the supervising organization of the national clubs and the sports associations.

International competition After being accepted as a National Olympic Committee member of the International Olympic Committee in July 1979, the Bahrain Olympic Committee started establishing a series of relations with Arab and continental nations. Late on, the Bahrain Olympic Committee joined the Arab Sports Games Federation and became a founding member of the Olympic Council of Asia, which was founded in November, 1982, as well as playing a major part in establishing the National Olympic Committee Union in August 1982. The Ninth Asian Games in New Delhi, in December 1982, marked Bahrain's maiden appearance on the continental level. The 1984 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, saw Bahrain compete for the first time on this level. Since then, Bahrain has been keen to participate in the Olympics and Asian Games, as well as on the Arab revel, with its maiden contributions being at the Sixth Arab Games in Rabat, in Morocco in September 1985. Bahrain reached high competitive standard, starting from the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, in South Korea, through to Doha Asian Games in 2006, the 2010 edition Games in Guangzhou, in China.

Medical education Pel attended the gymnasium at Sneek, then moved to study medicine in Leiden from 1869 to 1873. He became the assistant to one of his mentors, a Dr. Rosenstein, who was a professor of internal medicine at Leiden. Pel graduated cum laude in 1876. His doctoral thesis was entitled \\"The Fever Inducing Effect of Digitaline.\\" Career In 1878 Pel was appointed \\"chef de clinique‚Äù at the University Hospital in Amsterdam, and devoted himself to internal medicine‚Äîboth as a physician and as a researcher. In Pel's time, this meant all aspects of medicine besides surgery and gynecology; internal medicine was an extremely vast field. In 1880, Pel was appointed Lecturer in Contagious Diseases and Physiological Diagnostics. In 1883 he became a full Professor of Internal Medicine. In 1891 he was invited to go to Leiden University, but decided to stay in Amsterdam. Notable contributions in medicine Pel is perhaps best known for his description in 1885 of Pel‚ÄìEbstein fever, a cyclical fever that occurs very rarely in individuals who have Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Pel described in the Berliner Klinische Wochenschrift the cases of two patients who had periods of fever for 12‚Äì14 days, alternating with about 10 days of fever-free periods. Pel noted on post-mortem examination splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) as well as swelling of the lymph nodes. In 1887, German physician Wilhelm Ebstein described a similar case in the same publication. A polemic between the two followed over whether this phenomenon was a symptom of what was then called \\"pseudo-leukemia\\" (Pel) or that of a separate disease (Ebstein). Pel also discovered what came to be called \\"Pel's crisis,\\" defined as \\"Ocular crises in tabes dorsalis, characterized by neuralgic paroxysmal pains affecting the eyes and the ophthalmic area(s).\\" The term \\"Pel's crisis\\", however, is no longer commonly used, in favor of \\"tabetic ocular crisis\\". Pel shared the opinion of Sir William Osler, a contemporary of his, that the way to teach and train new physicians is at the bedsides of patients, rather than at a desk listening to lectures. Osler considered bringing students out of classrooms and into hospital wards‚Äîto learn by experience‚Äîto be his greatest legacy, and he is credited today as the father of the modern medical residency. Pel gave his inaugural speech on the importance of bedside medical teaching, which serves as a good example of the level of importance he ascribed to the adoption of this practice. Additionally, Pel was quoted as saying, \\"Whereas, formerly, the sick patient functioned primarily as an example or illustration of the dominating theoretical education, in the modern world the careful, objective examination of the patient warrants priority attention.\\" On a slightly different note, Pel was also quoted as saying, \\"When someone tells me that an animal on four feet is walking around in the yard next door, it could be a small tiger or elephant, but I still would rather think of a cat or a dog.‚Äù This quote is similar to a common anecdote that is still used in hospitals and medical schools‚Äî\\"When you hear hoofbeats, think horses‚Äînot zebras,\\"‚Äîand it is unclear whether the phrase quoted by Pel was originally his, or if he was reciting an adaptation of the modern common anecdote with zebras and horses.

Club career Easton joined Everton from Liverpool Ladies in 1997 and won the league title in her first season with The Blues. She had featured in Liverpool's FA Women's Cup final defeats in 1995 and 1996. Easton had a second spell with Everton having re-signed from Doncaster Rovers Belles in the 2004 close season, where she had been captain. In 2012 Easton was released by Everton, but won a contract for the 2013 FA WSL season with Liverpool after a successful trial. With Easton in the team Liverpool won the league title in 2013 and 2014 but were much less successful in 2015, finishing second bottom. Her 2015 campaign was truncated by a broken arm. Aged 41, she was among four players to be released by the club at the end of the season. In December 2015 Easton rejoined Doncaster Rovers Belles, where she would combine playing with a role as assistant general manager. Doncaster lost their four opening games and were marooned at the foot of the WSL 1 table, when Easton left the club by \\"mutual consent\\" in the mid-season break, ostensibly to focus on her studies.

The intention is towards the Olympic Games of 2012 to achieve status of Bhutan as one of the leading countries in Olympic archery. The bilateral cooperation has resulted in publication of a book, in 2004, on traditional and modern archery in Bhutan and the Netherlands, and a documentary film on Bhutan Olympic Archery to be screened in Germany and international channels.

In the 2004 Games held in Athens, which marked the return of the games to the location of the first modern Olympics, two archers, Tshering Choden and Tashi Peljor (second participation), represented Bhutan. They reached the second round of the qualifying round for the first time. Two student athletes, Kunzang Chhoden and Sonam Tobgay also were part of this team as archers selected for the Olympic Youth Camp. Sports The archery fever in Bhutan For each Olympic Summer Games since 1984, Bhutan has fielded male and female archers. Archery is the national sport of Bhutan. They have never competed in the Winter Games or the other events of the Summer Games; they also have not yet won an Olympic medal. While archery is the national sport of Bhutan and the only sport in which it participates in the Olympics, other popular sports in the country are tug of war, basketball, football and cricket. Adventure sports such as trekking, rafting, mountain biking and rock climbing are also popular. Archery is very popular throughout Bhutan ‚Äî each village has an archery range. However, until recently its equipment base was traditional (hand-carved bamboo bows); these have now been replaced by modern and high-tech equipment for international games.

REA arranged transport and delivery via existing railroad infrastructure, much as today's UPS or DHL companies use roads and air transport. It was created through the forced consolidation of existing services into a national near- monopoly to ensure the rapid and safe movement of parcels, money, and goods during World War I. REA ceased operations in 1975, when its business model ceased to be viable. Railway Express Agency luggage tag from New York City to Narrowsburg, for the Queens Boy Scout camp, Camp Man Early history Express delivery in the early 19th century was almost all by horse, whether by stagecoach or riders. The first parcel express agency in the United States is generally considered to have been started by William Frederick Harnden (1812-1845), who in 1839 began regular trips between New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, as a courier transporting small parcels, currency and other valuables. Another, Wells Fargo & Co., was founded in 1853. Other early express companies included Southern Express Company, Adams Express Company; and Butterfield Overland Mail. Ad for a railroad, showing American Railway Express service along the Utah Idaho Central Railroad, 1922 1900 to World War II The express business flourished in the latter half of the 19th century, and by 1900 there were four principal parcel express companies, all of which included the rapidly advancing railways as one of their means of transport: Adams Express Company, Southern Express Company, American Express Company, and Wells Fargo. Another competitor arrived in 1913: the U.S. Post Office expanded its services to offer Parcel Post. Still, private railway express business increased steadily through the end of World War I.Railway Express Agency office, San Augustine, Texas, 1939 American Railway Express freight wagon, Helena, Montana, 1922 During the winter of 1917, the United States suffered a severe coal shortage. On December 26, President Woodrow Wilson commandeered the railroads on behalf of the United States government to move federal troops, their supplies, and coal. Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo was assigned to consolidate the railway lines for the war effort. All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country's needs. The result was a new company called the American Railway Express Agency, which was formed in July 1918. The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies (40%, the largest share, came from American Express, who had owned the rights to the express business over of railroad lines, and had 10,000 offices, with over 30,000 employees). Beginning in December 1917, after the United States entered the war, the United States Railroad Administration (USRA) was established to take over the nation's railroads temporarily. Under the USRA, the four major and three minor express companies were consolidated as American Railway Express, Inc., except for the portion of Southern Express that operated over the Southern Railway and the Mobile & Ohio. The USRA returned the railroads to private ownership and control in 1920. In March 1929, the assets and operations of American Railway Express Inc. were transferred to Railway Express Agency (REA). REA was owned by 86 railroads in proportion to the express traffic on their lines; no one railroad or group of railroads controlled the agency. In response to customer demand, REA added a Chicago, Illinois-based refrigerator car line. In 1927, REA began an Air Express Division.\\"REA and Air Express Division\\", The World Almanac and Book of Facts, p.589. Abe Books In 1938, the remainder of Southern Express also joined the consolidated REA. Post-World War II Due to rate increases, express operations remained profitable into the 1950s. REA concentrated on express refrigerator service after 1940, and continued to expand its fleet of express reefers until the mid- to late-1950s. At that time, business declined dramatically owing to competition from refrigerated motor trucks. By this time, overall rail express volume had also decreased substantially. Federal investment in the interstate highway system after WWII meant that trucks and other vehicles had more flexibility in transporting goods to a variety of cities. The increase in private ownership of automobiles doomed many passenger lines of the railroads, and industrywide restructuring took place. REA baggage car detail. Railway Express Agency worker, WWII safety poster In 1959, REA negotiated a new contract, allowing it to use any mode of transportation. It also acquired rights to allow continued service by truck freight after passenger trains were discontinued. REA unsuccessfully attempted entering the piggyback and container business. Another blow came when the Civil Aeronautics Board terminated REA's exclusive agreement with the airlines for air express. REA Express and decline In 1960 the company's name was changed to REA Express, Inc. By 1965 many of REA's refrigerator cars, stripped of their refrigeration equipment, were in lease service as bulk mail carriers. Many were relegated to work train service. Generally, business was good in the 1940s. ‚ÄúAlas, things crumbled after World War II which coincided with a rapid decline in rail travel,‚Äù according to the America Rails website. ‚ÄúExpress shipments had always been handled as dead-end traffic and railroads grew increasingly disinterested in subsidizing a business model losing ever-more money.‚Äù In 1969, after several years of losses, REA was sold to five of its corporate officers. By then its entire business constituted less than 10% of all intercity parcel traffic, and it transported only 10% of its business by rail. Trying to find a way to survive, REA Express became embroiled in extensive litigation with the railroads and the United Parcel Service, and tried to renegotiate contracts with the Brotherhood of Railway Workers' Union. In November 1975, REA Express terminated operations and filed for bankruptcy. During the railroad strike of October 1974, the first Altair 8800 microcomputer was lost. It had been shipped from Albuquerque to Popular Electronics magazine in New York via REA and never arrived. \\"With the company losing money hand over fist for years, it was now in exponential debt. On average, REA had lost $50 million a year since 1969., In November 1975, Tom Kole, REA board chairman, told the press that the recession 'has literally pulled the rug out from under our carefully planned recovery program ‚Ä¶.' Disappearing along with 8,000 jobs was all the REA‚Äôs property, including those once familiar green trucks with the red-diamond signs, which was sold at auction.\\" Notable agents * Arthur Perdue worked as a Railway Express agent in Salisbury, Maryland.

He built Aylesford railway station on the Medway Valley Line to make his access to Preston Hall easier. Betts ran into financial difficulties after the banking crisis of 1866, became insolvent the following year and was forced to sell the hall which was brought by Thomas Brassey, also a railway contractor. Brassey had worked with Betts and Peto in the Peto, Brassey and Betts partnership. The hall was inherited by his son, Henry Brassey who was MP for Sandwich, in 1870.

History Old logo Before the Korean War, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognized a single Korean National Olympic Committee (NOC) representing both the North and South Korea, based in Seoul. After the war, North Korea displayed dissatisfaction with this arrangement, and repeatedly called for the creation of a North Korean NOC. The IOC declined these pleas on the grounds that there could be only one NOC per country. Regardless of the lack of recognition, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was founded in 1953 and it applied to join the IOC in June 1956. In the 1957 session of the IOC, the Olympic Committee of the USSR asked the IOC to provisionally recognize the North Korean NOC on the grounds that the East German NOC had been admitted alongside the Olympic Committee of West Germany. Recognition was to be done under the condition that the two Korean NOCs would agree to send a unified team to 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, but the plans failed due to opposition by the South's Korean Olympic Committee. The matter of a unified team was debated over the following sessions, and lobbied by the Bulgarian and Romanian NOCs, and in 1962 the IOC finally conferred provisional recognition on the North Korean NOC. Talks about a unified team continued in 1963, but these talks failed after the NOCs could agree on nothing but the flag, which was to consist of the word \\"Korea\\" under the Olympic rings. Between 1985 and 1988 the NOCs negotiated about co-hosting the 1988 Summer Olympics. The negotiations failed, resulting in North Korea boycotting the Games held in Seoul of South Korea.

See are infections of skin and associated soft tissues (such as loose connective tissue and mucous membranes). Historically, the pathogen involved has most frequently been a bacterial species‚Äîalways, since redescription of SSSIs as ABSSSIs‚Äîand as such, these infections require treatment by antibiotics. Types Until 2008, a distinction was made between two types: complicated SSSIs (cSSSIs) and uncomplicated SSSIs (uSSSIs), which had different regulatory approval requirements. Uncomplicated SSSIs included \\"simple abscesses, impetiginous lesions, furuncles, and cellulitis.\\" Complicated SSSIs included \\"infections either involving deeper soft tissue or requiring significant surgical intervention, such as infected ulcers, burns, and major abscesses or a significant underlying disease state that complicates the response to treatment.\\" The FDA further noted that \\"[s]uperficial infections or abscesses in an anatomical site, such as the rectal area, where the risk of anaerobic or Gram-negative pathogen involvement is higher, [were also] considered complicated infections.\\" The uncomplicated category (uSSSI) is most frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas the complicated category (cSSSI) might also be caused by a number of other pathogens. As of 2013, the pathogen involved in cases of cSSSI were known about 40% of the time. Diagnosis As of 2014, physicians were reported as generally not culturing to identify the infecting bacterial pathogen during diagnosis of SSSIs Treatment Common treatment is empirical, with choice of an antibiotic agent based on presenting symptoms and location, and further followup based on trial and error. To achieve efficacy against SSSIs, physicians most often use broad-spectrum antibiotics, a practice contributing to increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, a trend related to the widespread use of antibiotics in medicine in general. The increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance is evident in MRSA species commonly involved in SSSIs, which worsen prognoses and limit treatment options. For less severe infections, microbiologic evaluation using tissue culture has been demonstrated to have high utility in guiding management decisions. There is no evidence to support or oppose the use of Chinese herbal medicines in treating SSTIs.

Until the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Saudi Arabia was one of three countries that had never had a female competitor at the games. The other two countries, Qatar and Brunei, also selected women to compete for the first time. 2012 Summer Olympics In April 2012 the head of the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee ruled against sending female participants to the Summer Olympics in London. The Olympic committee had previously released a list of potential candidates for the games which included females. Saudi Arabia's refusal to send women to the Olympics put them at odds with the Olympic charter which states that \\"any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, sex or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement\\". The Olympic Committee's stance was later changed and it was announced that two female athletes, Sarah Attar (in the 800m) and will compete in the 800m and Wojdan Shaherkani (in the +78 kg Judo) judo would compete in London. Shaherkani was selected despite not meeting Olympic qualifying standards, by specific invitation of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Unlike most Olympic competitors, she did not win her spot through a national competition because Saudi Arabia strongly discourages women from participating in sport, and thus has no such competitions for women. Unlike other judoka in competition, who have attained black belts in the sport, she had only acquired a blue belt. The IOC president Jacques Rogge said of Shahrkhani's and Attar's inclusion, \\"The I.O.C. has been working very closely with the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee and I am pleased to see that our continued dialogue has come to fruition.\\" The Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee preferred not to promote Shahrkhani's participation. They also required that she \\"dress modestly, be accompanied by a male guardian and not mix with men\\" while in London for the 2012 Games. Additionally, her competition clothing has to comply with Sharia law. On 30 July 2012, Shahrkhani said that she would withdraw from the event if she was not permitted to wear her hijab during bouts. Her father (who often speaks for her, partially because she does not know English) clarified that he wanted his daughter to compete, and that they wanted to make \\"new history for Saudi's women,\\" but that she would not participate without a hijab. The next day the I.O.C. and the International Judo Federation announced that agreement had been reached on a headscarf that she could wear.

Since then, the Malbars have developed some patterns of behaviour that are not quite those of their ancestors from Tamil Nadu nor those of the other inhabitants of R√©union. Etymology Malbars is derived from the word Malabar, a term which was used often by the French and other Westerners to refer to all Southern Indians, including the Tamils, Malayalees, Telugus and Kannadigas. This term is based on the Malabar region of the present state of Kerala in India This term, applied by the French to Tamil labourers coming to R√©union, has been kept by the latter and others on the island to label their own identity. History Indian workers came to R√©union from South India, mostly from French settlements in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, and Karaikal. Most of these immigrants were ritually low in the caste system. Hard living conditions at home were the main reason behind their departure to La R√©union. The immigration of indentured workers from South India started in 1827 but it was only after 1848 that indentured immigration began on a big scale.Ghasarian, Christian. 1990. \\"Indianit La R√©union: gestion d'une double identit\\", Vibre au pluriel. Production sociale des identits l'le Maurice et l'le de La R√©union, J.L. Albert (ed.), Universit√© de La R√©union/URA 1041 du CNRS. Acculturation The French government in R√©union made the first Malbars become Christian. However, many Malbars were only nominally Christian. The Tamil language was lost to language shift.: \\"R√©union is a typical example of outsourcing by the French East India Company, and its history reveals how an hybrid culture emanated amidst Tamil settlers there, who are Tamils but could not speak Tamil, their mother tongue lost in the interregnum of 5 generations of separation from their homeland ...\\" Recent developments The Malbars desire to learn their ancestors' culture, and started studying their language and religions especially from Tamil Nadu. Recently many Malbars, particularly those of upper and middle classes, have started to become completely Hindu rather than nominally Christian. Genetics A genetic study has shown that the majority of the Indian origins of Malbars lie in the South- east of India. A significantly larger proportion comes from Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. The study also showed that 15-20% of the origins of Malbars come from elsewhere than India. Less than 1% comes from Europe.

During the early 1990s the deep recession at that time created difficulties for many in the property and construction industry. Consequently, in 1992 a management buyout resulted in the current company name Benoy. The company is headed by its chairman, Graham Cartledge CBE, who has been with the company since 1974.

It operated a production facility in Longmont, Colorado. The company was incorporated as AVA Solar in 2007 and was rebranded as Abound Solar in March 2009. In 2012 the company laid off almost half its employees before suspending operations and filing for bankruptcy. History Abound Solar's founders began researching thin-film deposition since the late 1980s. In 1991, W.S. Sampath, a professor at Colorado State University, patented a process for low-cost metal deposition within a vacuum. Al Enzenroth, Kurt Barth, Professor Sampath settled upon cadmium telluride (CdTe) as the ideal photovoltaic material for low-cost solar module production. By 1998, the team had developed a pilot production process featuring an inline, single-vacuum semiconductor deposition tool. Over the course of the next few years, the team continued to develop and refine the technology with strong support from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the National Science Foundation. By 2004, the founding team had scaled up the technology glass panels of in size. Federal funding from NREL and the Solar America Initiative enabled them to prove the viability of the technology. In 2006, AVA Solar, Inc. was formed with private funding from local angel investors to commercialize the technology. In early 2007, institutional investors discovered the company and the proprietary manufacturing process that had been developed.

They are popular in Indonesia and Malaysia.Sang Kancil Counts the Crocodiles, A word from the author - World of Tales A weak and small yet cunning figure, Sang Kancil uses his intelligence to triumph over beings more powerful than himself. The protagonist of these stories is Sang Kancil, a smart and sly mouse deer. He can fool the other animals to escape from trouble. This folk figure is similar to another folk figure, Br'er Rabbit. Sang Kancil and the Farmer  One day, Sang Kancil is trying to steal cucumbers from a farmer's field. The first time, he steals some cucumbers successfully. He then encounters a scarecrow, and he mocks it because it cannot scare him. He kicks the scarecrow with his front leg, but his front leg gets stuck in the scarecrow, which has been filled with glue by the farmer. He tries to pull out his leg, but in vain as the glue is too strong for him to pull out his leg. Later, the farmer comes and laughs at Sang Kancil, who has been trapped by the glue on the scarecrow. He then puts him inside a cage for the rest of the day. Later that night, the farmer's dog comes to see Sang Kancil. He mocks him and said that he will be cooked the next morning. Sang Kancil stays calm and relaxed. The dog got confused and asks him why. He said, \\"You are wrong, I'm not going to be cooked! I'm going to be a prince!\\" The dog becomes more confused. \\"I‚Äôll marry the farmer's daughter and I will become a prince. I feel sorry for you, all of your loyalties were paid just like this! You just become a dog! Look at me! Tomorrow, I'll become a prince!\\" said Sang Kancil proudly. The dog, who felt discriminated against by his own master, asks him to switch place. He thinks that by switching place with Sang Kancil, he will become a prince instead. So he opens the cage and lets him free. The next morning, the farmer is confused, because he does not see him anywhere; instead, he sees his own dog in the cage, wagging his tail. Sang Kancil and the Elephant One day, Sang Kancil is trapped inside a hole made by some hunters. He screamed for help but no one heard him. He thought it was hopeless for him to escape from the trap. He waited for while until an elephant came. Then, he had an idea. He said, \\"Hurry, come down here! Come down and seek shelter with me because the sky is falling!\\" The elephant, confused yet terrified, foolishly followed his order and jumped down into the hole. Sang Kancil quickly hopped onto the elephant's body and then jumped out of the hole, leaving the elephant trapped in the hole. Sang Kancil and the Crocodiles One day, Sang Kancil wants to cross a river, but however, the river is full of hungry crocodiles. The crocodiles might eat him if he crosses the river. Eventually, Sang Kancil had an idea. He told the crocodiles, \\"You cannot eat me unless you make a row!\\" One of the crocodiles replied, ‚ÄúWhy must we do that?‚Äù Sang Kancil replied, \\"The King (sometimes referred to as King Sulaiman) wants to make a party and he wants me to count all the animals in the jungle.‚Äù Believing in what he said, the crocodiles followed his order and formed a row of between the two sides of the river. He then quickly hops from one crocodile to another until he reaches the other side of the river, leaving the crocodiles far behind, angry. Sang Kancil and the Tiger One day, Sang Kancil was drinking on the river, when a tiger suddenly came who wanted to eat him. Sang Kancil tried to escape, but the tiger was faster than he was. Cornered by the tiger, he thought of how to escape. He said to the tiger, \\"Your mightiness and toughness are very great, but my king has a greater strength than yours! Nobody can match his!\\" Feeling taunted, the tiger declared he would challenge this ‚Äúking‚Äù. He led the tiger to the river and told him, \\"Look at the water and you will see my king.\\" The tiger looked into the river and thought saw another tiger in the water. He growled, but the \\"king\\", his reflection, growled too. Then he jumped into the water, believing there was another tiger there. Sang Kancil took his opportunity to escape. After fighting with his own reflection in the river, the tiger realized it was only his reflection. Fooled by Sang Kancil, the tiger wanted revenge and continues to hunt him down to this day.

For the majority of materials, the yield strength decreases with increasing temperature. In metals, this decrease in yield strength is due to the thermal activation of dislocation motion, resulting in easier plastic deformation at higher temperatures. In some cases, a yield strength anomaly refers to a decrease in the ductility of a material with increasing temperature, which is also opposite the trend in the majority of materials. Anomalies in ductility can be more clear, as an anomalous effect on yield strength can be obscured by its typical decrease with temperature. In concert with yield strength or ductility anomalies, some materials demonstrate extrema in other temperature dependent properties, such as a minimum in ultrasonic damping, or a maximum in electrical conductivity. The yield strength anomaly in Œ≤-brass was one of the earliest discoveries such a phenomenon, and several other ordered intermetallic alloys demonstrate this effect. Precipitation hardened superalloys exhibit a yield strength anomaly over a considerable temperature range. For these materials, the yield strength shows little variation between room temperature and several hundred degrees Celsius. Eventually, a maximum yield strength is reached. For even higher temperatures, the yield strength decreases and, eventually, drops to zero when reaching the melting temperature, where the solid material transforms into a liquid. For ordered intermetallics, the temperature of the yield strength peak is roughly 50% of the absolute melting temperature.  Mechanisms   Thermally Activated Cross Slip  A number of alloys with the L12 structure (e.g., Ni3Al, Ni3Ga, Ni3Ge, Ni3Si), show yield strength anomalies. The L12 structure is a derivative of the face-centered cubic crystal structure. For these alloys, the active slip system below the peak is ‚ü®110‚ü©{111} while the active system at higher temperatures is ‚ü®110‚ü©{010}. The hardening mechanism in these alloys is the cross slip of screw dislocations from (111) to (010) crystallographic planes. This cross slip is thermally activated, and the screw dislocations are much less mobile on the (010) planes, so the material is strengthened as temperatures increases and more screw dislocations are in the (010) plane. A similar mechanism has been proposed for some B2 alloys that have yield strength anomalies (e.g., CuZn, FeCo, NiTi, CoHf, CoTi, CoZr). The yield strength anomaly mechanism in Ni-based superalloys is similar. In these alloys, screw superdislocations undergo thermally activated cross slip onto {100} planes from {111} planes. This prevents motion of the remaining parts of the dislocations on the (111)[-101] slip system. Again, with increasing temperature, more cross-slip occurs, so dislocation motion is more hindered and yield strength increases.  Grain Boundary Precipitation  In superalloys strengthened by metal carbides, increasingly large carbide particles form preferentially at grain boundaries, preventing grain boundary sliding at high temperatures. This leads to an increase in the yield strength, and thus a yield strength anomaly.  Vacancy Activated Strengthening  While FeAl is a B2 alloy, the observed yield strength anomaly in FeAl is due to another mechanism. If cross-slip were the mechanism, then the yield strength anomaly would be rate dependent, as expected for a thermally activated process. Instead, yield strength anomaly is state dependent, which is a property that is dependent on the state of the material. As a result, vacancy activated strengthening is the most widely-accepted mechanism. The vacancy formation energy is low for FeAl, allowing for an unusually high concentration of vacancies in FeAl at high temperatures (2.5% at 1000C for Fe-50Al). The vacancy formed in either aluminum-rich FeAl or through heating is an aluminum vacancy. At low temperatures around 300K, the yield strength either decreases or does not change with temperature. At moderate temperatures (0.35-0.45 Tm), yield strength has been observed to increase with an increased vacancy concentration, providing further evidence for a vacancy driven strengthening mechanism.The increase in yield strength from increased vacancy concentration is believed to be the result of dislocations being pinned by vacancies on the slip plane, causing the dislocations to bow. Then, above the peak stress temperature, vacancies can migrate as vacancy migration is easier with elevated temperatures. At those temperatures, vacancies no longer hinder dislocation motion but rather aid climb. In the vacancy strengthening model, the increased strength below the peak stress temperature is approximated as proportional to the vacancy concentration to the one-half with the vacancy concentration estimated using Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. Thus, the strength can be estimated as e^{-E_f/2k_BT}, with E_f being the vacancy formation energy and T being the absolute temperature. Above the peak stress temperature, a diffusion-assisted deformation mechanism can be used to describe strength since vacancies are now mobile and assist dislocation motion. Above the peak, the yield strength is strain rate dependent and thus, the peak yield strength is rate dependent. As a result, the peak stress temperature increases with an increased strain rate. Note, this is different than the yield strength anomaly, which is the yield strength below the peak, being rate dependent. The peak yield strength is also dependent on percent aluminum in the FeAl alloy. As the percent aluminum increases, the peak yield strength occurs at lower temperatures. The yield strength anomaly in FeAl alloys can be hidden if thermal vacancies are not minimized through a slow anneal at a relatively low temperature (~400 ¬∞C for ~5 days). Further, the yield strength anomaly is not present in systems that use a very low strain rate as the peak yield strength is strain rate dependent and thus, would occur at temperatures too low to observe the yield strength anomaly. Additionally, since the formation of vacancies requires time, the peak yield strength magnitude is dependent on how long the material is held at the peak stress temperature. Also, the peak yield strength has been found not to be dependent on crystal orientation. Other mechanisms have been proposed including a cross slip mechanism similar to that for L12, dislocation decomposition into less mobile segments at jogs, dislocation pinning, climb-lock mechanism, and slip vector transition. The slip vector transition from <111> to <100>. At the peak stress temperature, the slip system changes from <111> to <100>. The change is believed to be a result of glide in <111> becoming more difficult as temperature increases due to a friction mechanism. Then, dislocations in <100> have easier movement in comparison. Another mechanism combines the vacancy strengthening mechanism with dislocation decomposition. FeAl with the addition of a tertiary additive such as Mn has been shown to also exhibit the yield stress anomaly. In contrast to FeAl, however, the peak yield strength or peak stress temperature of Fe2MnAl is not dependent on strain rate and thus, may not follow the vacancy activated strengthening mechanism. Instead, there an order-strengthening mechanism has been proposed.  Applications   Turbines and Jet Engines  The yield strength anomaly is exploited in the design of gas turbines and jet engines that operate at high temperatures, where the materials used are selected based on their paramount yield and creep resistance. Superalloys can withstand high temperature loads far beyond the capabilities of steels and other alloys, and allow operation at higher temperatures, which improves efficiency.  Nuclear Reactors  Materials with yield strength anomalies are used in nuclear reactors due to their high temperature mechanical properties and good corrosion resistance.

(FRI) is an industry cooperative organization that researches the performance of industrial-scale mass transfer devices such as trays, packings and other column internals. Its objective is to facilitate the design of more economical distillation, absorption and stripping systems. Before the formation of FRI, such research was performed on a small scale by universities or private companies. The latter controlled their results as proprietary information, generally inaccessible by competitors. History FRI is a non-profit organization formed by petroleum, chemical and engineering companies to perform plant-scale research in distillation. It began in 1952, spearheaded by Dr. Karl Hachmuth and T. B. Hudson of Phillips Petroleum Company in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Hachmuth was noted for his research into the design of mass transfer equipment, He realized that the effort required would be beyond the resources of a single company, and proposed the formation of a cooperative organization to pursue this work. Hudson became the first president of FRI. In 1954, FRI contracted to use a simulation facility at the headquarters of C. F. Braun & Co. in Alhambra, California. Operations continued at Alhambra until 1989, when Braun was acquired by Halliburton, Inc., and merged into its Brown & Root subsidiary https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/17/business/company-news-halliburton-deal.html New York Times,\\"Halliburton Deal\\" June 17, 1989.

Germany after 1990 is referred to by historians as the Berlin Republic (Berliner Republik). This time period is also determined by the ongoing process of the \\"inner reunification\\" of the formerly divided country.  Chancellorship of Helmut Kohl in a reunited Germany (1990‚Äì1998)   Five new states  Helmut Kohl after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 On October 3, 1990, the German Democratic Republic was dissolved, five states were recreated (Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia) and the new states became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, an event known as the German Reunification. Elections for new state parliaments were held in the five states on October 14, and the Christian Democratic Union of Germany became the largest party in all states except Brandenburg, where the Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest party. The reunified Berlin became the capital of Germany on October 3, although the government continued to have its seat in Bonn until 1999. December 2 marks the first elections for the city parliament after reunification.  Kohl's fourth term  The first federal election after reunification, the 1990 federal election, took place on December 2 in that year. The CDU became the largest party with 43.8%, followed by the SPD (33.5%) and the Free Democratic Party of Germany (11%).Karl Hugo Pruys, Kohl: Genius of the Present: A Biography of Helmut Kohl (1996)Diethelm Prowe, \\"Kohl and the German Reunification Era,\\" Journal of Modern History, March 2002, Vol. 74 Issue 1, pp 120-38 in JSTOR On June 20, 1991, the Bundestag decided that the parliament and parts of the government and central administration would be relocated from Bonn to the capital, Berlin. At this time, the term \\"Berlin Republic\\" (alluding to the Cold War era \\"Bonn Republic\\" and the interwar period \\"Weimar Republic\\") emerged. Roman Herzog, a former Judge at the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, was elected President of Germany in 1994, succeeding Richard von Weizs√§cker.  Kohl's fifth term  Following the 1994 federal election, Helmut Kohl was reelected as Chancellor for his fifth and last term.  Chancellorship of Gerhard Schr√∂der (1998‚Äì2005)  Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow on 9 May 2005  First term  The ruling liberal-conservative coalition government, consisting of the CDU/CSU and the FDP, lost the 1998 federal election, and Gerhard Schr√∂der was elected as Chancellor, the head of a coalition government consisting of his own SPD party and The Greens. Joschka Fischer, a leading Green politician, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Shortly after the formation of the government, Minister of Finance Oskar Lafontaine, a former SPD chairman and rival of Schr√∂der, resigned from the cabinet. He was succeeded as Minister of Finance by Hans Eichel. In 1998, it became known that the CDU/CSU had received anonymous funding. Helmut Kohl subsequently resigned as honorary party chairman, and in 2000, Wolfgang Sch√§uble resigned as party chairman. Angela Merkel, the Secretary General of the CDU since 1998, emerged as a leading figure in the party and was elected chairwoman in 2000. Johannes Rau at the German Evangelical Church Assembly in 2001 In 1999, Johannes Rau was elected President of Germany. Rau had tried to be elected president for several years. A large tax reform was implemented in 2000. After 2003, the federal government enacted a number of reforms in social and health policy, known as Agenda 2010. The Schr√∂der government also stressed environmental issues and promoted the reduction of greenhouse gas. Germany took part in the NATO war against Yugoslavia in 1999, when German forces saw combat for the first time since World War II. Chancellor Schr√∂der supported the war on terror following the September 11 attacks against the United States, and Germany sent forces to Afghanistan. Germany also sent forces to Kosovo and other parts of the world. In 1999, Germany partially adopted the Euro, which completely replaced the Deutsche Mark as the currency of Germany in 2002. Several German cities, notably Dresden and Magdeburg, experienced severe flooding during the 2002 European floods.  Second term  In 2002, Edmund Stoiber was the candidate for Chancellor for the CDU/CSU, the first time a CSU politician was chancellor candidate since the candidacy of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980. Both CDU/CSU and the SPD polled 38.5% in the 2002 federal election. Since the Greens became larger than the liberals, Gerhard Schr√∂der's government was reelected. Germany and France vehemently opposed the 2003 Iraq War, leading the administration of George W. Bush to label Germany and France as the Old Europe, as opposed to the countries (mainly former east bloc countries) that supported the war. However, Germany supported the United States militarily in other parts of the world, notably in the Horn of Africa and Kuwait. President Horst K√∂hler The early 2000s saw increased unemployment and an aging population. The government instituted further reforms to meet these challenges, known as the Hartz reforms. However, as the Bundesrat of Germany had a CDU/CSU majority, the government of Gerhard Schr√∂der was dependent on support from the conservatives in order to pass legislation. On May 23, 2004, Horst K√∂hler, the former head of the International Monetary Fund and a CDU politician, was elected President of Germany. K√∂hler, who was previously relatively unknown in Germany, quickly became one of the country's most popular politicians. After a bitter defeat for the SPD in state elections in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (22 May 2005), Chancellor Schr√∂der asked the German Bundestag (lower house of parliament) for a vote of no-confidence. Schr√∂der argued that it had become increasingly difficult to push for the necessary socio-economic reforms because of the opposition majority in the upper house of the parliament, the Bundesrat, as well as the tensions within his own party. After losing this vote, as intended, on July 1, Chancellor Schr√∂der was able to ask President Horst K√∂hler to call new federal elections. On 21 July 2005 the President agreed to Chancellor's request and dissolved the parliament, scheduling early parliamentary elections for 18 September.  Chancellorship of Angela Merkel (2005‚Äìpresent)   First term  Angela Merkel, 2008 The 2005 federal election resulted in a stalemate for both major parties, SPD and CDU/CSU, as they won almost the same number of seats, but not enough to form a majority without the support of several smaller parties. This was resolved on November 11, 2005, when both parties agreed to form a grand coalition led by Angela Merkel who became the first female Chancellor of Germany.Silvia Bolgherini and Florian Grotz, eds. Germany After the Grand Coalition: Governance and Politics in a Turbulent Environment (Palgrave Macmillan; 2011) Under Merkel, Germany hosted the 2007 G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Mecklenburg. In January 2009 the German government approved a ‚Ç¨50 billion economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn and a subsequent rise in unemployment rates.  Second term  In the 2009 federal election, the CDU/CSU and the FDP won a majority and Angela Merkel could form a coalition with the liberals, the Cabinet Merkel II. Guido Westerwelle became the new Vice Chancellor. The Social Democrats did especially poorly in the election.Thorsten Fass, \\"The German Federal Election of 2009: Sprouting Coalitions, Drooping Social Democrats,\\" West European Politics, July 2010, Vol. 33 Issue 4, pp 894-903 Among the major German political projects initiated in this term are the energy transition (Energiewende) [In fact, it was the previous government which initiated the exit from nuclear power. This policy was reversed by Merkel before she was forced into a U-turn by Fukushima.] for a sustainable energy supply, the \\"Debt Brake\\" (Schuldenbremse) for balanced budgets, the reform of German immigration laws, and high-tech strategies for the informatization and future transition of the German economy, summarized as Industry 4.0.  Third term  In December 2013, the grand coalition was re- established in a Third Merkel cabinet. The FDP Liberals are not present in the Bundestag for the first time. Since 2014, the newly established right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party were elected for various Landtag mandates. Major political projects of the second grand coalition under Merkel are the legislation for a general minimum wage in Germany and various welfare reforms, including pension reforms. Projects initiated with the Liberals in the second term are largely continued. Germany was affected by the European migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East entering the EU. The country took in over a million refugees and migrants and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on their tax income and existing population density. The decision by Merkel to authorize unrestricted entry led to heavy criticism in Germany as well as within Europe.  Fourth term  In 2017, Angela Merkel was elected to a fourth term as Chancellor. The FDP reentered the Bundestag, and for the first time the right- wing populist AfD also entered.  Notes   Further reading * Ash, Timothy Garton.

She created leading roles in several operas, including Simon Mayr's Ginevra di Scozia. Biography Teresa Bertinotti was born in Savigliano in Piedmont, northern Italy, but grew up in Naples where her parents moved when she was two years old. At the age of four she had her first music leassons and made her first stage appearance as a child singer at the Teatro San Carlo when she was 12. She studied singing with Baldassare La Barbiera and by the age of 20 had already sung at both La Scala and La Fenice. She went on to sing throughout Italy as well as in Germany, Austria, Portugal, Russia, the Netherlands, Ireland and England. She had a great success in The Magic Flute and Cos√¨ fan tutte at London's King's Theatre, where she appeared between 1811 and 1812. In 1801, she married the violinist and composer Felice Radicati (1775-1823) whom she had met in Turin, and the couple travelled throughout Europe together. Radicati composed several works for his wife's voice, including his opera Fedra, which Bertinotti sang in her first season at the King's Theatre. He is also said to have composed several arias for her to interpolate in Vincenzo Federici's Zaira for its first London performance in 1811.Grove (1900) p. 248 The couple settled in Bologna in 1815 when Radicati became leader of the municipal orchestra there and maestro di cappella at the San Petronio Basilica. Following Radicati's death in 1823,Bozoli (1837) p. 402 Bertinotti retired from the stage and taught singing.

Overview  The product performs the migration over a network and creates a virtual machine (VM)-based environment on the target PC that presents an \\"old computer\\" view to the user - with applications, settings and data from the old computer. The user can switch between the old and new desktops, copying files and text.

Operation  Operation can be divided into migration and the post-migration use of the resident software. During the migration process, user data is captured from the source OS, and transferred to the Windows 7 environment. This is achieved by running the migration software on both systems and choosing their respective roles when prompted by the application. The application auto-detects migration settings. An \\"Advanced\\" option allows the user to customize the migration process, allowing sources and targets to be customized. Custom filters can limit the data transferred, e.g. skipping archives and files larger than 100MB in size. Once migration is complete, another component runs in the background in the Windows 7 environment. It presents to the user a system tray icon that switches between the old and new desktops. The tray icon is present in the virtualized desktop as well. On each desktop, the tray icon also allows access to the other desktop's files. The user can copy and paste files or text between the desktops. The XP desktop consumes a small percentage of system resources only when it is actually being used by the user.

It is also found in nearby countries (such as Lithuania, under the name ≈Ωagarƒóliai) and Eastern European countries (such as Russia, under the name Krepli, ). The name is related to klen, the Swedish term for \\"slender\\", but is originally of Low German origin, which may indicate that the pastry was originally German. It is made from flattened dough cut into small trapezoids. A slit is cut in the middle and then one end pulled through the slit to form a \\"knot\\". The kleina is then deep-fried in oil or another kind of fat. In Scandinavia, klen√§ter are traditionally eaten around Christmas, most commonly in the southern parts of Sweden, and Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Denmark, the Baltic states, as well as Northern Germany. They may be sprinkled with sugar. Icelandic Kleinur are a very common everyday pastry, sold in bakeries (singly) and stores (in bags of ten or so) all around the country, and eaten plain.In√©s Pacheco, Let's Go: Europe on a Budget 2008, New York: Macmillan, 2008, , p. 536. History Klen√§ter are an old type of pastry and are mentioned in Denmark as early as the 14th century and appearing in Danish and Icelandic cookbooks in the 18th century and 19th century.Marta Mar√≠a Stephensen, Einfaldt Matreidslu Vasa‚ÄîQver fyrir heldri manna H√∫ss-freyjur, Leir√°rg√∏rdum vid Leir√°, 1800, . They are also referenced in a Swedish poem by Anna Maria Lenngren from 1800, called Grevinnans bes√∂k (English: The Countess' Visit). In the poem, a countess is invited to a dinner party at the home of a pastor, where she is served klen√§ter as part of the entr√©e. Klen√§ter also frequently appear in Christmas stories by famous Swedish author Selma Lagerl√∂f, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909. Regional variations In Norway, klen√§ter are known as Fattigmann and tend to be made with cardamom. In Norway, klen√§ter are known as fattigmann (English: poor man), or Fattigmannbakkels (English: poor man pastry), because, it was said, the high cost of making the cookies could leave you impoverished (fattig). Fattigmann tend to be made with cinnamon, cardamom and a dash of cognac as well as the other ingredients listed below. They are also eaten in the areas of North America where Scandinavians settled during the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. A similar pastry called \\"calzones rotos\\" (literally \\"broken panties\\") is eaten during winter in Chile. Preparation Preparing klejner in Denmark. The dough for klen√§ter is made from flour, egg yolks, sugar, and margarine or butter. The dough is rolled out and then cut into strips, in Iceland often with a special cutting wheel called a kleinuj√°rn. (A pizza cutter can also be used.) The size may vary, but about long is typical. The uncooked strips are covered with plastic wrap and left to rest for two hours in a cold place. They are then fried in oil or sometimes lard and the dough expands into shape. Traditionally, Icelanders fried kleinur in sheep tallow, but today oil is typically used. Lemon juice, br√§nnvin or cognac are optional ingredients in klen√§ter. Water mixed with acetic acid can be used instead. An alternative type of klen√§ter is sm√∂rdegsklen√§tter (English: puff pastry klen√§ter). Klen√§ter should be kept in a dry place.

Some form of wall probably existed from the foundation of the royal burgh in around 1125, though the first building is recorded in the mid-15th century, when the King's Wall was constructed. In the 16th century the more extensive Flodden Wall was erected, following the Scots' defeat at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. This was extended by the Telfer Wall in the early 17th century. The walls had a number of gates, known as ports, the most important being the Netherbow Port, which stood halfway down the Royal Mile. This gave access from the Canongate which was, at that time, a separate burgh. The walls never proved very successful as defensive structures, and were easily breached on more than one occasion. They served more as a means of controlling trade and taxing goods, and as a deterrent to smugglers. Throughout their history, the town walls of Edinburgh have served better in their role as a trade barrier than as a defensive one. By the mid 18th century, the walls had outlived both their defensive and trade purposes, and demolition of sections of the wall began. The Netherbow Port was pulled down in 1764, and demolition continued into the 19th century. Today, a number of sections of the three successive walls survive, although none of the ports remain.  Background  Edinburgh was formally established as a royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege of holding a market, and the ability to raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale.Bell, p.7 It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although it may have been a timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.Gifford pp.84‚Äì85 To the north of Edinburgh lay the Nor Loch, formed in the early 15th century in the depression where Princes Street Gardens are now laid out.Fife, p.4 This defence was not natural but man-made formed by creating a dam and sluice at the foot of Halkerston's Wynd to the east.Grants Old and New Edinburgh It was further augmented by the steep slope up to the northern edge of the Old Town.See Miller Edinburgh Castle, on its rocky outcrop, defended the western approach. Walls were therefore needed primarily on the south and east sides of the burgh. Early records mention a west gate in 1180, a south gate in 1214, and the Netherbow Port in 1369. In 1362 the Wellhouse Tower was built beneath the north wall of the castle, protecting the castle's water supply, and defending the approach along the south shore of the Nor Loch.Fife, pp.180‚Äì181  King's Wall  The King's Wall is first recorded in 1427, in a title deed which refers to the wall as the property boundary.Miller (1887) In 1450, King James II issued a charter permitting the burgesses of Edinburgh to defend their town, as follows: { width=\\"100%\\"  } Walling in Tweeddale Court, thought to be the King's Wall In a further royal charter of 28 April 1472, King James III ordered the demolition of houses built on or outside the King's Wall, which were hampering efforts to strengthen the defences.Marwick, pp.134‚Äì135 Edinburgh was thus one of only three Scottish towns to have medieval stone walls, the others being Stirling and Perth, though other towns had earth walls or palisades.McWilliam, p.36 The wall ran along the south side of the Royal Mile, above the Cowgate, from the slope of the Castle Hill in the west, almost as far as the modern St Mary's Street in the east, where it turned to cross the Royal Mile. In all, the King's Wall enclosed a space no larger than .Catford, p.18 The alignment of the wall was irregular, as existing property boundaries or walls were reinforced to form a defence.Schofield, p.181 The early wall had two ports: the Upper Bow or Over-Bow, in the vicinity of what is now Victoria Street, and the Nether Bow,From the Scots language nether, meaning \\"lower\\", and bow, meaning \\"arch\\". Dictionary of the Scottish Language on the Royal Mile near Fountain Close, which was located near around further west than the later structure. In addition, posterns (side gates) were provided, for example at Gray's Close.Cullen, p.1  Flodden Wall  The Flodden Wall in Greyfriars Kirkyard In 1513, King James IV led an invasion of northern England in support of the French and the Auld Alliance. On 9 September, the Scots met the English at the Battle of Flodden, and were heavily defeated, with King James killed on the field. An English invasion was widely expected, and in Edinburgh it was resolved to build a new town wall. However, the new wall was also an opportunity to control smuggling into the burgh, and the town council accordingly decided to extend the wall south to take in the Grassmarket and Cowgate areas of the burgh. Construction began the following year, but was not completed until 1560. Work started at the western end, and the final section was the stretch from Leith Wynd to the Nor Loch, incorporating the New Port. The cost of this last work was ¬£4/10s Scots per rood (one rood = six ells or 5.6 metres) for the wall, plus 40s per rood for the battlements.New Statistical Account of Scotland, p.627 The Flodden Wall, as it became known, was generally around thick and up to high.Potter, p.22 The Flodden Wall began at the south side of the castle, running south across the west end of the Grassmarket, where the West Port was located, and continued uphill along the Vennel. A watch-tower or bastion survives at this, the south-west extent of the wall. It then ran east, wrapping around Greyfriars Kirkyard, to the Bristo Port and the Potterow Port, both located in the vicinity of the National Museum of Scotland. Continuing east, the wall passed the Kirk o' Field, where the Old College now stands, and ran along Drummond Street, turning north at the Pleasance to enclose the former Blackfriars Monastery. The Cowgate Port was located at the foot of the Pleasance. From here, along St Mary's Wynd and Leith Wynd, the town's defences were provided by fortifying the existing houses along the west side of the wynds. At the junction of these wynds, at the Netherbow, the narrowed section of the High Street, stood the Netherbow Port, between the High Street and the Canongate leading to Holyrood Abbey and Holyrood Palace. At Leith Wynd Port (outside the town walls} the wall continued west to the Nor Loch, since replaced at this location by Waverley railway station, terminating at the New Port. The Flodden Wall enclosed an area of just under , and remained the limit of the burgh until the 18th century.Catford, p.20 Contained within this area, in 1560, was a population of around 10,000. The Netherbow Port in the 18th century, seen from the Canongate There were six ports in the Flodden Wall. Anti-clockwise from the castle they were: * West Port, built 1514 at the west end of the Grassmarket, where the modern street of West Port is today, and giving access to Wester Portsburgh; * Bristo Port (Greyfriars Port, Society Port), built around 1515 on Bristo Street, close to Greyfriars Kirk and the Society of Brewers;Coghill, p.13 * Potterrow Port (Kirk o' Field Port), at the head of Horse Wynd near the Kirk o' Field, giving access to Easter Portsburgh; * Cowgate Port (Soo-gate, Blackfriars Port), on the Cowgate near the Blackfriars Monastery, the access to the Grassmarket from the east; * Netherbow Port, access from the High Street to the Canongate (later dubbed \\"the Royal Mile\\"); * New Port, at the foot of Halkerston's Wynd beneath the modern North Bridge, giving access north to Multrees Hill. Besides, there were a number of small posterns. The heads and limbs of executed criminals were regularly displayed above the ports.Coghill, p.10 Of the six ports, the Netherbow was the only one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538,Kerr, p.303 and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.Kerr, p.304  Military action  Sketch of Edinburgh made in 1544, showing the Netherbow Port between the High Street and the Canongate (looking south) Although the expected English invasion never materialised after Flodden, the 16th century was a turbulent period in Scotland. In 1544 the Earl of Hertford led an English force into Scotland during the War of the Rough Wooing. On 6 May, having captured Leith, Hertford's men, under the command of Sir Christopher Morris, blew open the Netherbow Port with their artillery. The town was burned over the following three days, \\"so that neither within the walls nor in the suburbs was left any one house unburnt\\".The Earl of Hertford's expedition against Scotland, pp.10‚Äì12 Further disturbances took place during the troubled reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542‚Äì1567), and its aftermath. In 1558 the Protestant Lords of the Congregation marched on Edinburgh against the Catholic French Regent, Mary of Guise, and were able to take control of the town without difficulty, despite the guards posted at the city gate.New Statistical Account of Scotland, p.626 Following the forced abdication of Queen Mary, Scotland's nobility was divided between her supporters, and those of the infant King James VI, represented by a series of regents. Edinburgh was held for the Queen by William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and in May 1571 the town was besieged by the Regent's forces under James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. Repairs were made to the walls, and the Netherbow was barricaded. Nearby houses were pulled down to improve defences, and the siege gun Mons Meg was employed to batter houses outside the wall which were being used by snipers. Unable to make any headway, the besiegers withdrew on 20 May.Potter, pp.60‚Äì65 Again the defences were strengthened in September, in advance of a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage to breach the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were too strong for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again lifted.Potter, pp.85‚Äì86 A blockade of the town was continued until July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange retreated into the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party.Potter, pp.105‚Äì106 The siege of Edinburgh Castle continued until May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns shipped from England.Potter, p.135  Telfer Wall  One of the most intact sections of the Telfer Wall in the Vennel off Lauriston Place In 1618 the town council bought of land to the west of Greyfriars Kirk, which was enclosed between 1628 and 1636 by the Telfer Wall. Most of this land was subsequently sold to the charitable George Heriot's Trust, and is now occupied by George Heriot's School. The rubble-built wall ran south from the Flodden Tower in the Vennel to Lauriston Place; it then turned east, running as far as Bristo Street, where it returned north to the Bristo Port in the Flodden Wall. The Telfer Wall was named after its master mason, John Taillefer.  Later history and demolition  James VI tablet from the demolished Netherbow Port By the 17th century the King's Wall had been almost completely absorbed within later buildings, although it is briefly mentioned in the \\"Extent Roll\\", a town survey of 1635, and limited sections appear on James Gordon of Rothiemay's map of 1647. The mason John Mylne and the wright (carpenter) John Scott strengthened the Flodden and Telfer walls and constructed artillery emplacements in 1650. This was due to fear of an English attack on Edinburgh during the English Civil War (nearby Dunbar having been attacked). The quickly made changes included taking the four ornamental tops off the Netherbow Port, in order to install cannon.Grants Old and New Edinburgh volIV p.331 Further emplacements were built by Captain Theodore Dury in 1715, in response to the Jacobite rising of that year. In 1736, the lynching of Captain John Porteous by an Edinburgh mob led the British Government in London to impose sanctions on the town. Porteous, Captain of the Town Guard, had been convicted of murder following the shooting of spectators at a public hanging, but following a reprieve, a mob broke into the Tolbooth Jail and executed him. The initial demand by the House of Lords was for the demolition of the Netherbow Port, although this was resisted by the town, and commuted to a fine by the House of Commons.Roughhead, pp.126, 129 When the town was threatened by the Jacobite rising of 1745, a company of volunteer citizens was raised for the defence of the city, and the mathematics professor Colin Maclaurin advised on improvements to the walls.Gibson, p.9 However, as Bonnie Prince Charlie's troops approached, the town was undermanned and the walls undefended. On the morning of 17 September, a group of Highlanders under Donald Cameron of Lochiel rushed the Netherbow Port as the gates were opened, and Edinburgh was captured without a fight.Gibson, p.16 Brass plates mark the outline of the Netherbow Port Demolitions began soon after the withdrawal of the Jacobite threat in 1746.Coghill, p.14 The bastions of the Telfer Wall along Lauriston Place were demolished in 1762, as they were obstructing traffic. The Netherbow survived until 1764, when it too was removed as an obstruction.The clock from the Netherbow was later incorporated into the Dean Gallery. Coghill, pp.14,17 The West Port and the Potterow Port were removed in the 1780s.Cullen, p.4 By now, the New Town was under construction, and although smuggling of goods through the city walls was still being punished, complaints about the zealousness of the guards were widely circulated. The Old College of the University of Edinburgh (constructed from 1789), and then the museum in Chambers Street (constructed from 1861, now part of the National Museum of Scotland), were built over sections of the wall around the Potterow Port. Forrest Road was laid out in the 1840s, resulting in the loss of another section of the Telfer Wall.Cullen, p.17 During construction works around the Advocates' Library and Parliament House in 1832 and 1845, fragments of walling were uncovered, which were attributed to the King's Wall.Schofield, p.155‚Äì156 Two sections of the increasingly neglected town wall collapsed in the mid-1850s. In 1854, a large portion of wall (20 feet high and 3‚Äì4 feet thick), and the embankment against which it was built fell into Leith Wynd between the High Street and Calton Road. A week later the Dean of Guild ordered the removal of a 150 feet stretch of the wall from that location. In 1856, a lightning strike appears to have been the cause of the collapse of a 40 to 50 feet stretch of the wall enclosing Greyfriars Kirkyard.W M Gilbert (ed.), Edinburgh In The Nineteenth Century, J & R Allan Ltd., Edinburgh 1901  Surviving fragments  Nothing remains of Edinburgh's earliest enclosures, and very little of the King's Wall survives, although parts are probably incorporated in later buildings. A section of walling in Tweeddale Court, on the south side of the Royal Mile, may represent part of the eastern wall. This was exposed, identified and recognised as a fortified wall, initially by two labourers working on the renovation and restoration of the old Oliver & Boyd publishers in 1983. Subsequently, this was confirmed by archaeologists and planners and it was not demolished as consented. The height (), and lack of openings suggest a defensive purpose. Walling in Castle Wynd, north of the Grassmarket, has also been identified with the King's Wall. In 1973, archaeological excavations on the site now occupied by the Radisson Hotel, south of the Royal Mile, uncovered a fragment of wall, which was thought likely to be the King's Wall. There was also evidence of a house adjacent, which had been demolished sometime in the 15th century, presumably in response to James III's order of 1472.Schofield, p.160 The Flodden Wall at the corner of Drummond Street and the Pleasance Four sections of the Flodden Wall survive: to the north and south of the Grassmarket; in Greyfriars Kirkyard; and along Drummond Street and the Pleasance. North of the Grassmarket the wall runs alongside Granny's Green Steps and has been incorporated into later buildings, including the former Greyfriars Mission Kirk. A line of granite paving across the Grassmarket marks the line of the wall where it was uncovered during construction work in 2008. In the Vennel the last remaining bastion of the town walls survives. The Flodden Tower, as it is sometimes known, comprises two remaining walls with a total length of , pierced by crosslet gunloops and a 19th-century window. Sections of the Flodden Wall can be seen within Greyfriars Kirkyard, adorned with 16th and 17th century tombstones. At the junction of Forrest Road and Bristo Street a line of cobbles and a narrow gap in the later buildings mark the line of the wall. The longest section is in Drummond Street and the Pleasance, where it originally enclosed the Blackfriars Monastery. At the corner of the wall a blocked archway is probably the entrance to a demolished bastion. The site of the Netherbow is marked with an outline of brass blocks at the junction of the Royal Mile and St Mary's Street. Paving marks the line of the Flodden Wall in the Grassmarket There are two remaining sections of the Telfer Wall. The first runs along Heriot Place from the Flodden Tower, and forms the west boundary of George Heriot's School. The wall along Lauriston Place was demolished in 1762, as the bastions were obstructing traffic. The only remaining section is that forming the south wall of Greyfriars Kirkyard. An inscription on the building at the corner of Teviot Place and Bristo Street reads \\"1513 Site of Town Wall\\", although it was the 17th-century Telfer Wall, not the earlier Flodden Wall, which stood on this spot.Cullen, p.13 The majority of the surviving sections are protected as scheduled monuments: the Flodden Wall at Granny's Green; the Flodden and Telfer Walls at the Vennel and Heriot Place; and the Flodden Wall at Drummond Place and Pleasance. The walling in Tweeddale Court and the sections within Greyfriars Kirkyard are protected as listed buildings. The walls also form part of the Edinburgh Old Town World Heritage Site.

The Hereditary Health Court (), also known as the Genetic Health Court, was a court that decided whether people should be forcibly sterilized in Nazi Germany. That method of using courts to make decisions on hereditary health in Nazi Germany was created to implement the Nazi race policy aiming for racial hygiene. History German Sterilization Law or Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring The Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring in Nazi Germany was made into act on July 14, 1933, effective January 1934. This law gave rise to the profuse making of the health courts. The Sterilization law permitted complete authority to forcibly sterilize any citizen, who in the opinion of court officials, suffered from genetic disorders, many of which were not actually genetic. When the court outcome was sterilization for the individual in question, the court ruling could be appealed to the Higher Hereditary Health Court (also known as Hereditary Health Supreme Court). Dr. Karl Astel was in charge of the Hereditary Health Supreme Court from 1934 to 1937. The Hereditary Health Courts were responsible for the sterilization of 400,000 persons in less than a decade of operation. Structure of the Courts and Decision Making Processes The Hereditary Health Courts were structured uniquely in comparison to the rest of the Reich judiciary. Each court was chaired by a judge from the local magistrate court alongside two physicians. Additionally, those ordered to be sterilized had the right to appeal their decisions and there were appellate courts specifically created to hear such cases, chaired instead by a judge of the Oberlandesgericht. The courts were not technically independent institutions and were classified as subordinate parts of the local magistrate courts and district appellate courts. The presidents of the district courts also determined the number of deputies and medical staff members at their discretion. Women in general were not involved in the decision making, even when it most often was directly carried out on them. Sterilizations and abortions (almost no castrations) were common responses to deviancy. This was largely due to the fact that women had very little to no say in the inner circles of decision-making courts. The men making the decisions were often much more sympathetic to the plights of other men. Nazi officials also tended to offer tax breaks to those families who were hereditarily preferred, encouraging that they produce more offspring. Usually it was a mix of unemployment, family balance, and social welfare that were considered for appropriate approaches. The activities of the higher (appellate) Hereditary Health Courts were suspended in November of 1944 by order of the Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War.  Influence of American Eugenics on Nazi Race Policy  The Nazi authority assigned the nickname \\"model U.S.\\" to America for playing a prominent role in constructing their policy on race in Germany. Eugenicists in the United States were aware and very pleased at having influenced Nazi legislation. The German Sterilization Law was affected by the California sterilization law and modelled after the Model Eugenic Sterilization Law but was more moderate. The Model Eugenic Sterilization Law required people who were mentally retarded, insane, criminal, epileptic, inebriated, diseased, blind, deaf, deformed, and economically vulnerable to be sterilized. On the other hand, the German law called for sterilization in cases of mental retardation, schizophrenia, manic- depression, insanity, hereditary epilepsy, hereditary blindness, deafness, malformation, and Huntington's chorea. American Eugenicists' Prominence in Nazi Germany Some respondents were described by Lothrop Stoddard, an American eugenicist, visiting the Nazi state in 1939. That day were tried an 'apelike man' who had married a Jewish woman, a manic depressive, a deaf and mute girl, and a 'mentally retarded' girl. After being witness to the trials, he reported the Sterilization Law was being carried out with strict provisions and that the judges of the Hereditary Health Courts were almost too conservative. He reported on his experience with extreme support for the Hereditary Health Court, and went as far to say that the Nazi's were \\"weeding out the worst strains in the Germanic stock in a scientific and truly humanitarian way\\". The Hereditary Health Court in Nazi Germany is evidence that Nazi Germany's eugenic program was the most successful in implementing racial policies and eugenic ideals. More specifically, as Lothrop Stoddard stated after his visit to Germany in 1940, \\"Nazi Germany's eugenic program is the most ambitious and far-reaching experiment in eugenics ever attempted by any nation\\". Many eugenicists initially thought that the campaign in Nazi Germany would boost the influence of eugenics in the U.S. as well. With this in mind, leading philanthropic organizations in the U.S. gave generously to support Nazi research in this area. The eugenic laws were able to flourish in Nazi Germany because of the efficiency of their legislative model, which included the Hereditary Health Court. A 1939 book authored by Von Hoffman and titled Racial hygiene in the United States has a whole sterilization chapter that was widely regarded with approval in the early development of the health courts. Nazi testing for racial hygiene was also directly influenced by the earlier American eugenics work. Harry Laughlin was known as one of the most influential American eugenicists on sterilization law in Germany. His book Human Selection had a \\"model Sterilization Law\\" that was used as a model for the guidelines of sterilization in the courts. A rather unexpected and interesting fact regarding the Hereditary Health Courts in Nazi Germany is that the Nazi race and health administrators gave American eugenicists access to multiple institutions involved in the eugenics movement, which included visits to the Hereditary Health Courts. This access surprisingly had positive influences on the promotion of the Hereditary Health Courts. William W. Peter, an American Eugenicist who visited Nazi Germany, believed that the Hereditary Health Courts were essential in guaranteeing the correct application of the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring. Marie E. Kopp, who was an American eugenicist that visited Germany for six months in 1935, was given the opportunity to interview judges of the Hereditary Health Courts. She published various speeches and articles and was convinced that the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring was implemented fairly, in part because of her familiarity with the processes and proceedings of the Hereditary Health Courts. Evidence regarding the supposed fairness of the application of the law is provided through facts relating to the sterilization process when deemed necessary by the Hereditary Health Courts. According to Kopp, there were no adverse health effects from properly performed sterilization operations. Apparently, 0.4 percent of all the women who underwent sterilization died during the operation. This would mean that a total of 4,500 women died while undergoing a sterilization operation which judges of the Hereditary Health Court ordered them to receive.  Sterilization in Nazi Germany Compared to Sterilization in Other Countries  Sterilizing disables the sex organs of the individual, making it impossible to reproduce. Procreation became a privilege because only authorized individuals were allowed to produce offspring‚Äîtheir characteristics were considered specifically desirable. Although sterilization in the United States was more limited than it was in Germany, German racial hygienists highlighted that sterilization practices in some areas of the United States were more extreme than those in Nazi Germany. The International Federation of Eugenic Organization held a conference in the Netherlands in 1936. Although Germany had the largest number of attendees, there were also representatives from the United States, Denmark, England, Sweden, Latvia, Norway, Estonia, France, and the Netherlands. When applied eugenics were discussed, the Nazi race policies presented by the German racial hygienists once again dominated.

History NEADS (formerly National Education for Assistance Dog Services and also formerly Dogs for Deaf and Disabled Americans) began in 1976 as The Hearing Ear Dog Program, on the Lenox, Massachusetts campus of Holliston Junior College. With seed money from the Medfield Lions Club, students in the Animal Care Program determined that hearing dogs could be trained to become \\"ears\\" for people who are deaf or hearing impaired. In 1987, after training over 400 hearing dog \\"teams,\\" The Hearing Ear Dog Program expanded to train service dogs to become the \\"arms and/or legs\\" for people with physical disabilities. In 1989, to reflect these new services, The Hearing Ear Dog Program changed its name to New England Assistance Dog Services (NEADS). NEADS began the Prison PUP Program in 1998, in which prison inmates foster and train service dog puppies for one to two years. In 2000, NEADS expanded its services to include the training of service dogs trained to assist children with autism and other developmental disabilities. In 2006, NEADS began a specialty program for injured soldiers returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through its Service Dogs for Veterans program. The organization now resides on an campus in Princeton, MA.NEADS Website Puppy program Originally, NEADS used dogs from shelters and private breeders. In 2000, purpose-bred puppies from Guiding Eyes for the Blind and other respected Service Dog organizations were introduced. The program completion rate for these dogs with specific temperaments and excellent health was higher, so NEADS has shifted to using primarily purpose- bred dogs ‚Äì obtained through its own breeding program and from other Service/Guide Dog organizations - to allow for better control for temperament, health, and overall suitability for Service Dog work. Early socialization exposes the puppies to different surfaces, people, sounds and objects. Progressive socialization continues throughout the pup‚Äôs training to make sure that when they are matched with a client, they are experienced and confident. Prison PUP Program The NEADS Prison PUP Program was started in 1998. NEADS partners with 7 correctional facilities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, where inmates train the dogs for one to two years. As early as 16 weeks, puppies live, train, and bond with inmates. NEADS trainers visit the facilities once a week to teach the inmates how to train their puppies, and to monitor progress.\\"Prison Pups.\\" Dog's Life Magazine, Summer 2009. pp 16-19.\\"Going to the Dogs: Prison-based Training Programs are Win-Win\\" Corrections Today, August 2009.

Rainbow was trained by an inmate at the Northeast Correctional Center. NEADS has provided service dogs to veterans at no cost since 2006. Since that time, NEADS has matched over 100 dogs with veterans. NEADS was the first service dog organization in the US to be invited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center to present the ways service dogs could help wounded combat veterans.

Portrait of Henry Mark Anthony. 1880s. Present location unknown Henry Mark Anthony (4 August 1817 - 1 December 1886) was an English landscape artist, often favourably compared to John Constable by critics. He exhibited at many major art institutions and travelled widely, being credited with introducing the en plein air style of painting to Britain. Life and work Anthony was born at Rusholme Lane, Manchester, of Welsh ancestry, and was the second son of John Anthony, merchant, and his wife, Phoebe.Anthony's elder brother, John (1813‚Äì1895), was a doctor, traveller, and distinguished microscopist. The family moved to Cowbridge, Glamorgan (in Wales), around 1823. Anthony was apprenticed to a doctor called Harrison who, being an amateur artist himself, encouraged his artistic leanings. Subsequently he is reported to have been a pupil of his cousin George Wilfred Anthony, a drawing- master in Manchester (later a landscape painter and art critic - as Gabriel Tinto - for the Manchester Guardian). Anthony moved to London around 1833. Patronage and a legacy received in the 1830s, allowed him to travel. Thus he studied at The Hague, in Paris, at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts with Paul Delaroche, Ary Scheffer, and Horace Vernet, and in Fontainebleau in 1837, where he was influenced by the Barbizon school, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and Jules Dupr√©. Henry Mark Anthony. Nature's Mirror. 1854 Anthony was among the first British artists to introduce the French style of plein-air landscape painting to London. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, between 1837 and 1884,Showing a total of thirty-six pictures, the British Institution (1841‚Äì60),Showing 7 paintings and the Society of British Artists (1841‚Äì69).Showing 84 works. He was elected a member of the latter in 1845, resigning in 1852 in the hope that it would assist his election to associateship of the Royal Academy. In 1843 he showed one of his paintings at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) and in the same year was elected its member. He also exhibited once at the Grosvenor Gallery and the Liverpool Academy, winning the 1854 prize of ¬£50 for Nature's Mirror (Wolverhampton Art Gallery). He travelled and painted in England and Wales, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Spain. At the time, Anthony was considered the second best British landscape artist after John Constable. Working directly from nature, he painted on the large scale, introducing into painted landscape melancholic mood, nostalgic feelings, and atmospheric effects often enhanced by the light of dawn or early evening over an old church or castle. However, new developments in British art after 1860, and his failure to be elected to the Royal Academy, led to a solitary later career. Relationship with other artists Anthony was admired by the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood (attending their ‚Äòhouse-warming‚Äô at Newman Street, London, on 12 January 1850). William Michael Rossetti praised his landscapes in 'The Spectator' and 'Critic' and later wrote: \\"The works which Anthony produced between some such dates as 1847 and 1857, were certainly very remarkable, and stood out saliently from the throng.\\"Cited in J. P. Warren. \\"Walt Whitman's Language Experiment\\" (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1990) p31. Anthony was a close friend of Ford Madox Brown, mentioned frequently in Brown's diaries - in 1851, the two artists undertook a walking tour of the Isle of Wight. Dante Gabriel Rossetti helped to secure Anthony the patronage of the important Newcastle collector James Leathart in the 1860s. At about the same time, Anthony corresponded with the famous Birmingham pen-maker and art patron Joseph Gillott (1799-1872). He intended to buy from Gillott musical instrument in exchange for cash or one of his paintings. Anthony's art dealer was Sergeant Ralph Thomas who was said to pay Anthony \\"sixpence a minute\\" for his pictures and owned about one hundred sketches by him.Chapel, J. The papers of Joseph Gillott (1799-1872). In: Journal of the History of Collections. Vol.20 (1), 2008. pp. 37-84. Anthony's only known portrait was painted by George Phoenix (1863‚Äì1935). It was on loan from Phoenix to Wolverhampton Art Gallery until 1931, when it was returned to Anthony's descendants. Family Anthony married Eleanor Sophia Marshall (c.1809/1816-1891)In the 1881 census, Eleanor Sophia Anthony lived alone, was a lodger and described herself as an artist, landscape painter. and had at least three daughters: Phoebe Grace (1850 - after 1901),Phoebe Grace (1850 - after 1901), married John George S.

The word prebiarum seems to be a corruption of breviarium,Joseph F. Kelly, \\"Scripture and Tradition in the Early Irish Church\\", Scripture, tradition and reason: a study in the criteria of Christian doctrine: essays in honour of Richard P.C. Hanson (Continuum International Publishing Group, 1988), p. 163 online. Multorum is also given incorrectly as multorium. though the work is not a breviary in the usual sense; the title is not customarily translated into English, but would mean something like \\"A Breviary of Examples from Many Sources\\". The Latin dialogue makes use of triads, a tripartite form of expression characteristic of early Irish literature.Mary F. Wack and Charles D. Wright, \\"A New Latin Source for the Old English 'Three Utterances' Exemplum\\", in Anglo-Saxon England (Cambridge University Press, 1991), vol. 20, p. 197 online. Its subject matter is exegetical or didactic; that is, it seeks to explain or teach, often through an enumeration of its points.Charles Darwin Wright, The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 61. The Prebiarum is mostly of comparative interest, and has been dismissed as an example of texts, often written by monks, that \\"display a vulgarization of religious subjects, treating them as popular trivia, meant more for fun and humour than for any overly didactic, serious purpose\\".Liam Ethan Felsen, \\"Medieval Monks: Funnier Than You Thought\\", in Misconceptions about the Middle Ages (Routledge, 2008), p. 72 This characterization may represent an elitist view not evident to all readers of the Prebiarum. Like other catechetical Hiberno-Latin writings, the Prebiarum with its modest aims seems intended to help ordinary people with Bible study.Robert E. McNally, Scriptores Hiberniae Minores Pars I, Corpus Christianorum 108B (Turnhout, 1973), p. 155. The text's 20th-century editor regarded the Prebiarum as \\"a handbook useful to the itinerant preacher, the teacher, or even to the spiritual father charged with the obligation of giving spiritual conferences or instructions. ‚Ä¶ In no sense is the work sophisticated; it is rather simple, direct, even somewhat archaic in spirit.\\".McNally, SHM pp. 155‚Äì156. Sources, analogues, and intellectual context Despite its 8th-century date, the Prebiarum is disconnected from the intellectual and theological preoccupations of the Carolingian Renaissance and represents a more \\"primitive state of biblical learning\\". Its methods cannot be said to derive from the exegetical literature of 7th-century Ireland, nor from the Northumbrian tradition of Bede.McNally, SHM p. 156. As a collection of miscellaneous snippets from various sources (collectanea), the Prebiarum draws on patristic sources such as Jerome, Augustine and Gregory, as well as medieval writings of obscure origin. The Prebiarum is similar to the Joca monarchorum (\\"Monks' jests\\") and Collectanaea pseudo-Bedae (sometimes noted as Collectanaea Bedae). The author or compiler of the Prebiarum drew on at least three works by Isidore of Seville, the Etymologiae, De ecclesiasticis officiis and the Sententiae, along with the Irish pseudepigraphical Liber de numeris.McNally, SHM p. 155; Claudia di Sciacca, Finding the Right Words: Isidore's Synonyma in Anglo-Saxon England (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 43. Other parallels can be found in works of Irish provenance or character, such as Pseudo-Cyprian's De XII Abusiuis Saeculi, the Irish Pseudo-Bede's De XIII Diuisionibus Temporum, the Cambrai Homily and Pseudo-Isidore's Questiones tam de nouo quam de uetere testamentum.McNally, SHM p. 158. Linguistically, the text is influenced by Merovingian and Vulgar Latin.McNally, SHM p. 157. The Prebiarum is addressed to an Adalfeus (Adalfeo spiritali), who might tenuously be identified as the Adelphus (d. 670) who was the third abbot of Remiremont. The Adalfeo of the text might also be a mistaken transliteration of Greek ·ºàŒ¥ŒµŒªœÜ·ø∑ (from adelphos, \\"brother\\"), and the phrase mean \\"for a spiritual brother.\\"McNally, SHM p. 159. Triads St. Virgilius in Salzburg The Prebiarum provides an enumerative response to many of the questions it poses, often in the form of a triadic utterance, including triads on greed (cupiditas)Richard Newhauser, The Early History of Greed: The Sin Of Avarice in Early Medieval Thought and Literature (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 112 online. and martyrdom.

The text The Prebiarum exists in a single manuscript that was most likely transcribed in the scriptorium of Bishop Arbeo of Freising. It thus originated in southeast Germany around Salzburg, probably within the circle of St. Virgilius, which had a strong Irish presence. It is bound with five other minor works, four of which are of Irish provenance. Orthography and linguistic aspects date the work to the mid-8th century.McNally, HSM pp. 155, 158, 159. Claudia di Sciacca concurs that the Prebiarum likely originated in the Salzburg area at the time of the bishop Virgilius, despite its Irish character; p. 43; Charles Darwin Wright, The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 60‚Äì61, note 64. Given this setting, it may be Arbeo who is addressed in the dedication as a \\"spiritual brother\\".McNally, SHM, p. 159. Selected bibliography * McNally, Robert E.

The street runs west-east from King William Street to East Terrace. On the other side of King William Street, it continues as Currie Street. Its intersection with Pulteney Street is encircled by Hindmarsh Square. Grenfell Street was named after Pascoe St Leger Grenfell, a British businessman and valued member of the South Australian Church Society. His significant donation of an acre of land on North Terrace was used for the construction of the Holy Trinity Church ‚Äî one of the first churches built in the city. Raikes Currie was treasurer of the South Australian Church Society, and his name his used for the western continuation of Grenfell Street across King William Street. Grenfell also donated another 40 acres of country land for the use of the church as glebe lands. This land later became the suburb of Trinity Gardens. The section of the street which runs parallel to Rundle Mall features many retail outlets, as well as the southern entrances of many of the arcades, side-streets, and eateries of the mall. Office buildings and night spots also populate the street. The eastern end is occupied on the south side by Tandanya, a museum of Indigenous Australian art, and on the north side by the East End Markets redevelopment.

Lutherans believe that, whenever they are properly administered by the use of the physical component commanded by God along with the divine words of institution, God is, in a way specific to each sacrament, present with the Word and physical component. They teach that God earnestly offers to all who receive the sacrament forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation. They teach that God also works in the recipients to get them to accept these blessings and to increase the assurance of their possession. Characteristics of a sacrament In the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, sacraments are defined as: > If we define the sacraments as rites, which have the command of God and to > which the promise of grace has been added, it is easy to determine what the > sacraments are, properly speaking. For humanly instituted rites are not > sacraments, properly seen because human beings do not have the authority to > promise grace. Therefore signs instituted without the command of God are not > sure signs of grace, even though they perhaps serve to teach or admonish the > common folk.Article XIII: The Number and Use of the Sacraments, vv 3‚Äì4, > Apology of Augsburg Confession, The Book of Concord, Minneapolis, MN: > Augsburg Fortress, 2000, 219 ‚Äì 220. Sacraments Baptism The Sacrament of Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which one is initiated into the Christian faith. Lutherans teach that at baptism, they receive God's promise of salvation. At the same time, they receive the faith they need to be open to God's grace. Lutherans baptize by sprinkling or pouring water on the head of the person (or infant) as the Trinitarian formula is spoken. Lutherans teach baptism to be necessary, but not absolutely necessary, for salvation. That means that although baptism is indeed necessary for salvation, it is, as Luther said, contempt for the sacraments that condemns, not lack of the sacraments. Therefore, one is not denied salvation merely because one may have never had the opportunity to be baptized. This is what is meant by saying that baptism is necessary‚Äîbut not absolutely necessary‚Äîto salvation. Eucharist The Sacrament of the Eucharist (also called the Sacrament of the Altar, the Mass, the Lord's Supper, the Lord's Table, (Holy) Communion, the Breaking of the Bread, and the Blessed Sacrament) is where communicants eat and drink the true Body and Blood of Christ Himself, \\"in, with and under the forms\\" of the consecrated bread and wine. This Eucharistic theology is known as the Sacramental Union. (It has been called \\"consubstantiation\\", but most Lutheran theologians reject the use of this term, as it creates confusion with an earlier doctrine of the same name.F.L. Cross, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, second edition, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1974), 340 sub loco.) Penance The rite of Penance (confession) is not universally observed as a sacrament in the Lutheran Church, primarily due to the consideration of lack of a visible element. The Sacrament has two forms: the General Confession (known as the Penitential Rite) that is done at the beginning of the Eucharistic service. In this case, the entire congregation says the Confiteor, as the pastor says the Declaration of Grace (or absolution), and Holy Absolution that is done privately to a pastor, where, following the person (known as the penitent) confessing sins that trouble them and making an Act of Contrition, the pastor announces God's forgiveness to the person, as the sign of the cross is made. In historic Lutheran practice, Holy Absolution is expected before first partaking of the Eucharist.Apology of the Augsburg Confession, article 24, paragraph 1. Retrieved 2010-04-18. General confession, as well as Holy Absolution, are still contained in the Lutheran hymnals. Two works which are part of the Book of Concord, the Confessions of the Lutheran Church,Tappert,TG ed. \\"The Book of Concord\\". Fortess Press, 1959, pp. 221 & 445. lend support to the belief that Holy Absolution is for Lutherans a sacrament. The Apology of the Augsburg Confession acknowledges outright that Holy Absolution is a sacrament, referring to it as the sacrament of penitence. In the Large Catechism, Luther calls Holy Absolution the third sacrament, referring to it as Penance. Non-sacramental rites Confirmation Confirmation is a public profession of faith prepared for by long and careful instruction. In English, it is known as the \\"affirmation of baptism\\", and is a mature and public profession of the faith which \\"marks the completion of the congregation's program of confirmation ministry\\". The German language uses for Lutheran confirmation a different word (Konfirmation) from the word used for the same Sacrament in the Catholic Church (Firmung). Confirmation teaches Baptized Christians about Martin Luther's doctrine on the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, the Sacrament of Holy Baptism, Holy Absolution, and the Sacrament of the Eucharist. An average catechism class lasts about two years. Holy matrimony Holy matrimony is a union between a man and woman, acknowledging the grace of God in their life. Holy Orders Although the Lutheran Confessions do not deny that Holy Orders may be considered Sacramental (See \\"Apology to the Augsburg Confession, Article XIII,\\" paragraphs 11-12: \\"But if ordination be understood as applying to the ministry of the Word, we are not unwilling to call ordination a sacrament. For the ministry of the Word has God's command and glorious promises, Rom. 1:16: The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. Likewise, Is. 55:11: So shall My Word be that goeth forth out of My mouth; it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please. 12] If ordination be understood in this way, neither will we refuse to call the imposition of hands a sacrament.\\"), Lutherans, on the whole, reject the Roman Catholic teaching of Holy Orders because they do not think sacerdotalism is supported by the Bible.Luther, Martin. Concerning the Ministry (1523), tr. Conrad Bergendoff, in Bergendoff, Conrad (ed.) Luther's Works. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1958, 40:18 ff. Martin Luther taught that each individual was expected to fulfill his God-appointed task in everyday life. The modern usage of the term vocation as a life-task was first employed by Martin Luther.Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, trans. Talcott Parsons, Ch.3, p. 79 & note 1. In Luther's Small Catechism, the holy orders include, but are not limited to the following: bishops, pastors, preachers, governmental offices, citizens, husbands, wives, children, employees, employers, young people, and widows.See Luther's Small Catechism However, in some Lutheran churches, Holy Orders refers to the three orders of bishop, priest and deacon, and the sacrament or rite by which candidates are ordained to those orders, is retained. Anointing of the Sick The Lutheran Church, like others, use as biblical reference for Anointing of the Sick.ELCA Anointing, Retrieved 9 November 2009LCMS Anointing , Retrieved 9 November 2009 The process of this rite consists of laying on of hands and/or anointing with oil; while the form consists of prayers.

The image shows the location, in the Burgsvik beds of Sweden, where the texture was first identified as evidence of a microbial mat. Microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) are primary sedimentary structures formed by the interaction of microbes with sediment and physical agents of erosion, deposition, and transportation.Noffke, N., 2003, Microbially induced sedimentary structures, in Middleton, G.V., ed., Encyclopedia of Sediments and Sedimentary Rocks: Boston, Kluwer Academic Publishers, p. 439-440. The structures commonly form when microbial mats (which may comprise bacteria, fungi, protozoans, archaea or algae) are preserved in the sedimentary geological record. There are 17 main types of macroscopic and microscopic MISS.Noffke, N., 2010, Microbial Mats in Sandy Deposits from the Archean Era to Today: Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 193 p. Of those, wrinkle structures and microbial mat chips are the most abundant in the fossil record. Other MISS include sinoidal structures, polygonal oscillation cracks, multidirected ripple marks, erosional remnants and pockets, or gas domes. Although these structures have only recently been named and systematically described, links between microbes and distinctive structures in sediments and sedimentary rocks have been suggested by several early workers.Pratt, B.R., 2003, Stromatolites, in Middleton, G.V., ed., Encyclopedia of Sediments and Sedimentary Rocks: Boston, Kluwer Academic Press, p. 688-690.Gerdes, G. and Krumbein, 1987, Biolaminated deposits: Springer, Heidelberg, 169 p. MISS have been identified in beds formed in the Archean and may be the oldest complete fossils on Earth. In the Ediacaran period, they are often associated with the preservation of fossils of the Ediacara biota; subsequent to this point their prevalence declines as a result of the Agronomic revolution A number of criteria have been proposed for recognising genuinely biological structures, and discriminating them from similar-looking features that can arise through geological processes. These relate to the extent of metamorphism to which the rocks have been subjected; their stratigraphic position with respect to sea-level; their depositional environment; their relationship to ancient hydraulics; and their texture. Individual studies on microbial mat-induced sedimentary structures are summarized and illustrated in several recent books, including Atlas of microbial mat features preserved in the siliciclastic rock record Schieber et al., eds., 2007, Atlas of microbial mat features preserved in the siliciclastic rock record: Elsevier, 324 p. and Microbial Mats in Siliciclastic Depositional Systems Through Time.Noffke, N. and Chaftez, H., 2012, Microbial Mats in Siliciclastic Depositional Systems Through Time: SEPM Special Publication 101. According to a study on the planet Mars, there may be sandstone beds, associated with the Gillespie Lake Member of Yellowknife Bay, visited by the Curiosity rover, that are similar to MISS on Earth.

He was introduced to the topic of sexual activity at the age of nine while a member of the Jackson 5. He and his brothers would perform at strip clubs, sharing the bill with female strippers and drag queens, and the sexual adventures of his brothers with groupies further affected Jackson's early life. The entertainer said his \\"first real sex in bed\\" was with the child actress Tatum O'Neal,Jackson, p.165 when he was a teenager in the 1970s; he called her \\"my first love ‚Äì after Diana Ross.\\"Jackson, p.166 The pair eventually \\"cooled off\\" and Jackson entered into a romance with model Brooke Shields in 1981. Although the relationship was platonic, Shields said there were times he had asked her to marry him but as he grew older he started to change physically and became more asexual towards her. Having first been introduced to Lisa Marie Presley by her father, Elvis, in 1974, Jackson reconnected with Lisa Marie in November 1992. Shortly after becoming involved with her, in 1993, Jackson was subjected to his first set of child sexual abuse accusations, followed by similar allegations in 2003. Presley supported Jackson as he became dependent on pain medication, and eventually helped convince him to enter drug rehabilitation. In a telephone call, he proposed marriage to Presley. She agreed, and the two wed on May 26, 1994, at a private ceremony in the Dominican Republic. Married life for the couple was difficult, and the union ended in divorce in August 1996. Presley and Jackson continued to date, on and off, for four more years after their divorce. Throughout his marriage with Presley, Jackson maintained a friendship with Debbie Rowe. She was the assistant of the pop singer's dermatologist and had been treating his appearance-changing disease vitiligo since the mid-1980s, and while he was separated from but still married to Presley. Rowe suffered a miscarriage and lost their baby in March 1996. Following the ordeal and the finalization of his first divorce, Jackson wed the pregnant Rowe on November 13, 1996, in Sydney, Australia. From the marriage, two of Jackson's three children were produced: son Michael Joseph \\"Prince\\" Jackson, Jr. (born February 13, 1997) and daughter Paris Michael Katherine Jackson (born April 3, 1998). Jackson and Rowe divorced on October 8, 1999, with Rowe giving full custody rights of the children to Jackson. His third and final child, son Prince Michael Jackson , was born to an unnamed surrogate mother on February 21, 2002. In July 2009, it was revealed Jackson's will named Diana Ross as the next-in-line guardian for his children, after his mother, Katherine. In September 2009, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach released a book based on taped conversations he had with Jackson in 2001. It included Jackson's thoughts on personal relationships in general and specific ones. His romantic feelings for two famous friends were widely cited in the media; when asked if he got jealous when his long-time friend Elizabeth Taylor dated other men, he replied, \\"Yes and no. I know that if we ever did anything romantically, the press would be so mean and nasty and call us the Odd Couple. It would turn into a circus and that's the pain of it all.\\"Boteach, p.231 Early sexual and emotional experiences Strip clubs Jackson's father Joseph had his sons play in strip clubs, despite the boys' strict religion From a young age, Jackson was exposed to sex. He received mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have the Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in the earliest days of their career.Taraborrelli, pp. 30‚Äì33 He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. While playing at Chicago's Peppermint Lounge, the brothers made use of a peephole in their dressing room, through which they had a clear view of the women's bathroom. They would take turns watching the women and, as Marlon recalled, \\"learned everything there was to know about ladies\\". During other residencies, the siblings would perform the Joe Tex song \\"Skinny Legs and All\\". Joseph would instruct a young Michael to make his way into the audience, crawl under tables, lift up ladies' skirts and peek at their panties as part of the performance. Though embarrassed by the task, Jackson feigned enjoyment as he knew the audience loved the routine. Following such performances, the Jackson brothers would be tucked in bed by their oblivious mother and reminded of the virtues of being a good Jehovah's Witness. Katherine remained unaware of her sons' strip club activities for many years. Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli reflected on Jackson's early life and noted that at such a young age, the singer may not have been psychologically equipped to fully understand any sexual stimulation he may have received from such voyeuristic events. The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father. Groupies and prostitutes As members of the increasingly successful Jackson 5, Michael's brothers Jermaine and Jackie found fame advantageous. As they toured the country, they had sex with many female fans. Their guide was their father Joseph, who would often organize and arrange sexual encounters for his sons as well as cheat on his wife Katherine with their sons' groupies. The two brothers would bring girls back to a hotel room, where younger siblings Michael and Marlon were instructed to \\"play sleep\\".Taraborrelli, pp. 94‚Äì98 One girl, who had sexual relations with Jermaine, recalled such an experience: > \\"I jumped into bed with him and he climbed on top of me. As he climaxed, he > shuddered so loudly I was afraid he would wake up Michael and Marlon, who > were sleeping three feet away in the next bed. Or at least I thought they > were sleeping. As I was slipping out of the room, I heard Michael say to > Jermaine, 'Nice job. Now, can we please get some sleep?'\\" While Marlon would correspond with and eventually marry his wife Carol at 18, Michael never had sex with groupies, finding his brothers' behavior toward women disgusting. In addition to not touching groupies, Jackson reportedly never had an interest in having any type of sex as a youngster. In one alleged incident, when he was 15 years old, a male family member arranged for two prostitutes to take his virginity. They were told to \\"work him over\\", before being locked in a room with him. Instead, Michael picked up a Bible and read bible verses to the girls, who left in tears. James McField, who worked with the Jackson 5, stated that the lead singer of the band often needed someone to talk with. It was at these times that women would be introduced to him for companionship. McField asserted that he never witnessed anything sexual, and that such females were not Jackson's type; \\"He liked nice girls, pure girls who appeared to have no street background.\\" Jackson occasionally admonished and advised the groupies and prostitutes sent to pleasure his siblings. One Jackson fan recalled being selected from the audience to meet with Jackie. Backstage, she was handed a scrap of paper with an address to the location in which they were to meet. Michael approached her from behind and warned her that his brothers did not treat women right and that his brother only wanted to use her for sex. Changing the subject, the female fan asked for the pop star's autograph, which request he obliged in addition to writing, \\"Please, don't go\\". The woman ignored Michael's request and headed to the Jacksons' apartment complex, where she had sex with Jackie. Afterward, Jackie informed the woman that they would not meet again. Ashamed and upset, the fan left the apartment in tears. On another occasion, a prostitute was brought to Jackson's room after a concert in Madison Square Garden. There, the pop star interrogated the prostitute, asking why she was a prostitute, whether she wanted to have sex with him, and how much it would cost. The woman responded that she was a prostitute for the money, but that she would have sex with him for free because she wanted him. The prostitute then proceeded to unbutton her blouse, exposing her breasts. Apparently repulsed, Jackson turned his head and begged her to \\"put them back\\". The singer suggested that they talk instead but would still pay her, which the prostitute declined to do; she was not there to talk. Instead, she gave Jackson her telephone number, urging him to call her when he wanted to \\"get off\\". Jackson acknowledged the prostitute as she left, stating that he would perhaps call her one day, though he never did. First relationships Tatum O'Neal One of Jackson's first documented relationships was with the child actress Tatum O'Neal in the 1970s. Their friendship was established by the time O'Neal was 12 and Jackson was 17, and featured in gossip columns for several years after. Jackson reflected in 1982 that he and O'Neal had been engaged in a serious relationship, but because both were busy, it had \\"cooled off\\" to the point of their remaining just friends. In the documentary Living With Michael Jackson (2003), Michael alleged that near the beginning of their relationship, the 12-year-old actress tried to seduce the then 17-year-old singer. According to Jackson, the incident happened at her home, where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex. O'Neal's behavior apparently proved too much for Jackson, who became scared and covered his face, before she walked away. When confronted with the allegation, O'Neal claimed to have been \\"just as shocked as everyone else\\". She stated that while having respect for Jackson as an artist and a person, he had \\"a very vivid imagination\\". The actress described his statements as \\"inaccurate\\"; \\"at 12 years old, there was no way she was capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed\\". O'Neal released her autobiography A Paper Life in 2004, a year after the Jackson documentary. In the book, she claimed it was Jackson who attempted to make out with her. The actress wrote, \\"I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter[...] Michael, who was sweating profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. He jumped up nervously and said, 'Uh ... gotta go.'\\" But this contradicted O'Neal's own account of the relationship, published in 1995 in Vibe magazine, where she remembered Jackson as \\"being so shy\\" and \\"one of the nicest, most innocent people I've ever met\\", and, \\"Once he came into my bedroom, and he wouldn't even sit on my bed.\\" She described the relationship as \\"a really wonderful friendship\\" where they would dance and \\"talk on the phone all the time.\\" She recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he could not. And that one time they had a \\"jam session\\" at her house, where he played the drums and her brother played guitar. She said the relationship ended when she was 12, after he asked her to go with him to the premiere of The Wiz, in which he acted, but her agent disapproved, \\"maybe because they thought he wasn't a big enough star yet\\", and she did what she was told because she was a child. Jackson also spoke about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He described holding hands with her: \\"I was, like, in heaven. It was the most magical thing. It was better than kissing her, it was better than anything.\\" He recalled one of the times they held hands: > I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called > the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath > the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [Rabbi Shmuley: > She held your hand and you felt love?] Fireworks going off. It was all I > needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She > wasn't into innocence, and I love that.Boteach p.196-197 And similar to what he told Bashir, he said, \\"...she was 13. And I was naive. She wanted to do everything and I didn't want to have sex at all.\\" Brooke Shields Jackson met 15-year-old actress-model-socialite Brooke Shields in 1981, at the Academy Awards. From there, the pair enjoyed a close relationship. Speaking in 2009, she reflected that they were close because sex was never an issue for them. Although the headlines in the media referred to Shields' talking about an \\"asexual Jackson\\" after his death, what she actually said was, \\"As he grew older and the more he started to change physically, the more asexual he became to me.\\" She also said that as she grew up and started having boyfriends, she would confide in him about her intimate experiences, as he was curious. She said, \\"he was like a little kid who talked about the bases ‚Äì what first base was, what second base was\\" ‚Äì and his curiosity was understandable given his guarded life. In 2001, Jackson told Rabbi Shmuley: Shields was \\"one of the loves of my life. I just wished she loved me as much as I loved her\\", and that they \\"dated a lot.\\" Before meeting her, he said that he had pictures of her all over his room. He recalled his happiness when they first met in 1981. He was at the 53rd Academy Awards with Diana Ross, and Shields walked up and introduced herself; then at the after-party, she asked him to dance with her. They exchanged numbers, and he \\"was up all night, singing, spinning around my room, just so happy.\\" He also said, ‚ÄúWe had one encounter when she got real intimate and I chickened out. And I shouldn‚Äôt have.‚Äù In his autobiography Moonwalk (1988), Jackson said his relationship with Shields was \\"romantically serious for a while.\\" Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt such a move would have \\"divided [her] life too much\\". She recalled: \\"There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have me for the rest of your life, you don‚Äôt need to marry me, I‚Äôm going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you‚Äôll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn‚Äôt want to lose things that meant something to him.\\" As the couple's separate lives diverged, the two gradually saw each other less. At the time of Jackson's death in 2009, the pair had not seen each other for 16 years. Shields claimed that in the singer's last years \\"it was harder to get the right number to get through to him\\". In July 2009, she spoke at the Michael Jackson memorial service, reminiscing about their time together: > \\"Thinking back to when we met and the many times that we spent together and > whenever we were out together, there would be a caption of some kind, and > the caption usually said something like 'an odd couple' or 'an unlikely > pair,' but to us, it was the most natural and easiest of > friendships...Michael always knew he could count on me to support him or be > his date, and that we would have fun no matter where we were. We had a > bond...both of us needed to be adults very early, but when we were together, > we were two little kids having fun.\\"  Diana Ross  Jackson first met Diana Ross at the age of 9. He wrote in his autobiography that she was his \\"mother, sister and lover all combined in one\\". When in mid-80's Ross married Arne Ness, he was jealous, because he \\"loved her and always will\\". They appeared together on a TV special in 1981, where Ross called him \\"sexy\\". According to J. Randy Taraborelli, there was no sexual relationship between the two. Jackson wrote at his will back in 2002, that Ross would take custody of his children if his mother, Katherine, died before him. It was rumored that Dirty Diana, as well as a few other songs, were about Ross, however these rumors were later debunked. Lisa Marie Presley First meeting and courtship Lisa Marie Presley was introduced to Jackson by her father Elvis In 1974, a 16-year-old Jackson ‚Äî who would later be dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\" ‚Äî was introduced for the first time to Lisa Marie Presley at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada by her father, \\"The King of Rock 'n' Roll\\", Elvis Presley. Lisa Marie was six years old at the time, and had been brought to the hotel to watch a show by the Jackson 5, of whom she was a big fan. The young girl was particularly fascinated by lead singer Michael Jackson and his talent at dancing.Taraborrelli, pp. 506‚Äì545 According to a friend of Presley, \\"their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A.\\" They met at a private dinner held at the home of their mutual friend, the artist Brett-Livingstone Strong. Knowing that Presley had been looking for help within the music industry, Strong had her play tapes for Jackson, who was impressed with Presley's voice. The pair talked for the remainder of the night, until it was time for Jackson to leave. At this point, according to Strong, the entertainer gave Presley, who was still married at the time, a penetrating look and said in a conspiratorial voice, \\"You and me, we could get into a lot of trouble. Think about that, girl.\\" In the days following this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both felt they had missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having spent most of their lives feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland. In 1993, he became the subject of child sexual abuse accusations and Presley, along with a few others, was there for emotional support. Jackson would call Presley from overseas as he embarked upon the second leg of the Dangerous World Tour and the child abuse investigation intensified. During such telephone conversations, Presley attempted to reverse Jackson's sadness with humor and advice. Presley later recalled that she believed in the musician's innocence and that she could \\"save him\\". Fueled by her past addictions and her father's death, Presley supported Jackson as he became addicted to painkillers, urging him to settle the allegations out of court and go into rehabilitation. He subsequently did both. Proposal and wedding It was during one of Jackson's calls to Presley that he proposed marriage. \\"If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?\\", the singer queried. Though still married to actor Danny Keough, whom she had wed in 1988 and had two children with, Presley replied that she would. After a pause, Jackson exclaimed that he had to use the bathroom. Having apparently relieved himself, the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine and she had to believe him. In 2010, Presley acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey that Jackson did formally propose one day in the library, taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting down on his knees. (The link does not have the full transcript but there are online videos of the interview). Following several months engaged, Jackson and Presley wed on May 26, 1994, at a ceremony in the Dominican Republic.Taraborrelli, pp. 553‚Äì557Jones, p. 11 Presley had divorced Keough only 20 days before. The 15-minute ceremony was held by Judge Hugo Francisco Alvarez Perez at his home in the La Vega Province. The union was conducted in Spanish and translated for Presley and Jackson by an attorney. Eva Darling, Presley's friend, served as a witness along with Thomas Keough, her ex-husband's brother. At the time of their marriage, the press and public were unaware that the two even knew each other. The wedding was kept secret from them, Jackson's family, and Presley's mother Priscilla. However, Gotham Chopra recalled that Jackson called him \\"in a panic\\" on his wedding night and asked if he had any \\"sex advice\\", wanting \\"to make sure that Lisa was impressed with his 'moves.'\\" Upon being informed of her daughter's marriage with Jackson a week later, Priscilla became irritated; she believed the male pop singer was using her child to rehabilitate his image following the child abuse accusations. To the press, however, Priscilla stated that she was \\"very supportive of Lisa Marie and everything she does\\". The union was met with a mixed reaction from the media when it was made public two months later. Some sources described the union of \\"The King of Pop\\" and \\"The Princess of Rock 'n' Roll\\" as being \\"The Marriage of the Century\\".Jones, p. 12 One newspaper headline scoffed, \\"Jackson-Presley Union Sparks Shock, Doubt, Laughs.\\" Addressing both the media and public, the new Mrs. Presley-Jackson issued a statement: > \\"My married name is Mrs. Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson. My marriage to Michael > Jackson took place in a private ceremony outside the United States (11) > weeks ago. It was not formally announced until now for several reasons; > foremost being that we are both very private people living in the glare of > the public media. We both wanted a private marriage ceremony without the > distraction of a media circus. I am very much in love with Michael, I > dedicate my life to being his wife. I understand and support him. We both > look forward to raising a family and living happy, healthy lives together. > We hope friends and fans will understand and respect our privacy.\\" Married life and disagreements For the next year of their married life, the newly wedded couple divided their time between Jackson's Neverland Ranch in Santa Ynez, California and Presley's estate, away in Hidden Hills. Defying the initial thoughts of some of the public, Presley did not move into Jackson's home upon getting married. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, this was due to her wanting to remain independent, as well as Presley's children (Danielle and Benjamin) finding their new stepfather \\"a little strange\\".Taraborrelli, pp. 558 The pair first appeared together on television at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards, in what has been described as a \\"memorable moment\\". Holding hands, the couple walked onto the stage in New York. In front of a television audience of 250 million, Jackson announced, \\"Just think, nobody thought this would last\\", before embracing Presley in a kiss.Taraborrelli, pp. 560‚Äì565 Afterward, Presley became angered at her husband, feeling he had used her. The male pop singer reasoned that the liplock, which was dubbed \\"The Kiss of the Century\\", would be talked about for decades, with people playing the clip over and over. Jackson's attempts at placating his wife proved futile; she told the singer not to \\"fucking even come near me\\" and remained angry for several days. In the same week, Jackson and Presley had another argument. Newspaper reports had been suggesting that if Elvis were alive, he would not approve of his daughter's marriage. Annoyed, Jackson reportedly suggested that the couple could find out by holding a s√©ance to contact the deceased \\"King of Rock 'n' Roll\\". During the session they would ask his opinion of the union. Presley felt the idea was tasteless and, upon Jackson's continuing to push the idea, warned, \\"If you stay on this particular road, they're gonna need a medium to contact you in the Great Beyond, because I'm about to put you there, right now.\\" The two supposedly never spoke of the incident again. Primetime and further marriage difficulties Jackson and Presley appeared on the television show Primetime in June 1995. In Jackson's first interview since 1993 and Presley's first ever, Diane Sawyer quizzed the pair on their private life with, according to Jet, a series of \\"insensitive\\" questions. Presley boasted that she and Jackson had regular sex, following Sawyer's questioning their sex life. When asked if the marriage was a sham, Presley asserted that such rumors were \\"crap\\"; she said she would never marry someone for any other reason than being in love with him, and concluded that if the public thought differently, they could \\"eat it\\". The following day, Presley reflected that the interview had been a disaster; she had hoped the couple would be perceived as being serious, yet Jackson fooled around during the show, at one point holding two fingers behind his wife's head to make bunny ears. Presley's friend Monica Pastelle revealed that it was at this point that Presley began to wonder whether she had made a mistake in choosing Jackson as a long-term partner. A further problem for the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never believed he was a pedophile‚Äî\\"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that\\"‚Äîshe felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations.Taraborrelli, pp. 566‚Äì567 One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, Jackson pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them. Presley also disagreed with having children with the singer. Imagining the future and what would happen if the marriage ended, Presley saw a \\"custody battle nightmare\\".Taraborrelli, pp. 574‚Äì575 In addition, she felt her husband was too emotionally immature to be a parent, having watched his daily interactions with other people; she believed he was the one in need of parenting. Jackson explained to his wife over breakfast one morning that she did not have to be the biological mother if she so desired. He explained, \\"My friend Debbie [Rowe] said she will get pregnant and have my baby. If you won't do it, then she will. How about that?\\" Unmoved, Presley replied that it was fine by her. Following several more troubled months, Jackson ended up in the hospital; he had collapsed while rehearsing for a concert in New York. Presley arrived to meet her ill husband, and yet another heated debate ensued. The argument ended after Jackson warned her that she was making his heart rate go up and asked her to leave. She obliged, and was admonished by a doctor and Jackson's mother Katherine along the way.Taraborrelli, pp. 576‚Äì579 Presley subsequently returned to Los Angeles. Upon being discharged from the hospital, Jackson went to Disneyland Paris to recover. Divorce Presley filed for divorce in early 1996, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\" and noting their date of separation as December 10, 1995, shortly after the incident in the hospital. The divorce was finalized on August 20, 1996. As part of the settlement, Presley received 10% of the royalties from HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, which album contained the song \\"You Are Not Alone\\", whose music video featured a semi-nude Presley and Jackson frolicking against an ethereal backdrop.Taraborrelli, pp. 580‚Äì581Taraborrelli, p. 609 As she did not sign a confidentiality agreement, a further clause stated that Presley could write a tell-all book about her time with Jackson. At the time, \\"The Princess of Rock 'n' Roll\\" revealed that she had no wish to write a memoir; the singer still had respect for Jackson and did not want to speak critically of him. Presley also wanted to preserve her own dignity and keep their life together private. The divorce proved difficult for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley was the first person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also the first time that the pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he longed to be. Aftermath Presley was seen with Jackson in various cities during the HIStory World Tour in 1997; notably at various functions in South Africa and in London, holding hands backstage and around the city. In February 1998, they were photographed in an intimate moment together outside a Beverly Hills restaurant on Presley's birthday. In a 2010 interview on Oprah, Presley said that they spent four years after the divorce staying in contact, until she felt she \\"had to push him away\\". She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was \\"going to end up the same way\\". She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last \\"coherently good conversation\\" she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called \\"vampires\\". She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him. But Presley also said his death made her realize he loved her. She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, \\"He honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me\\", but \\"I didn‚Äôt appreciate it then, and I wish I did.\\" At the end of the conversation, he reportedly told her \\"he felt that someone was going to try to kill him to get a hold of his catalog and his estate\\" and named some names she did not want to say in the interview. Debbie Rowe Background and friendship Debbie Rowe met Jackson in the mid-1980s, while working as an assistant for his dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe treated Jackson's vitiligo, which he had been diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life.Taraborrelli, p. 521Taraborrelli, pp. 570‚Äì573 Rowe supported Jackson, providing answers to the questions he asked about his medical condition. The pair became good friends; the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise to the woman, who hung it on the walls of her office. According to her friend Tanya Boyd, Rowe would obsess over Jackson. She would say to her friend, \\"If people knew him like I knew him, they would not think he was strange. He's unique, kinky, actually.\\" The Jackson‚ÄìRowe friendship would last for several years, during which time Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to have felt trapped by. Rowe and Jackson would both talk to each other about their unhappy marriages; his with Presley and hers with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt Rowe was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough. First pregnancy and miscarriage As Presley had refused to carry Jackson's children, Rowe offered to give birth to a child for the pop singer. Shortly after Presley and Jackson's separation, Rowe became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage in March 1996. The event devastated Rowe, who feared she would never be able to have a baby. Jackson comforted and consoled Rowe throughout the ordeal, which remained hidden from the media and public. Second pregnancy and reaction Jackson embarked on the first leg of his HIStory World Tour in September 1996. One month into the tour, and several months after his divorce from Presley, Jackson's personal life made headlines as it was revealed that Rowe was pregnant with his child. One tabloid newspaper, the News of the World, told the story under the headline \\"I'm Having Michael's Baby\\". Rowe reacted furiously to the publication, labeling the editorial staff \\"bastards\\" and complaining that they reported the story as if she and Jackson were freaks. J. Randy Taraborrelli later noted that the article, which had been put together from a secret recording between Rowe and a friend, had been fairly accurate. It detailed that Jackson was the father of the baby, and that he would be raising the child alone. It also stated that Jackson impregnated Rowe artificially with his own sperm cells, a \\"foolproof\\" method of insemination. Rowe later stated that she had never had sex with Jackson. Further reports alleged that the relationship was an \\"economic\\" one; she was in it for the money, and he sought a baby.Taraborrelli, pp. 582‚Äì584 In a statement, Jackson condemned the accusations of being in an economic relationship and using artificial insemination as \\"completely false and irresponsible\\". Despite the denials, it was noted that Rowe had received millions of dollars from Jackson as \\"gifts\\" over the years. Among court papers filed against Jackson in 2002 by business manager Myung Ho Lee, a monthly budget for Jackson was detailed and included a $1.5 million payment to Rowe. The pop icon later bought the woman a $1.3 million home in 1997; he and Rowe never lived together. When the news of Rowe's pregnancy broke to Jackson's mother Katherine, the Jackson family matriarch urged her son to wed the mother of his unborn child. Katherine did not want her son to be like his father, who had produced an illegitimate child with a woman while married to Michael's mother. Katherine first spoke on the telephone to Rowe about the sanctity of marriage and about the Jehovah's Witness faith. She later spoke to Jackson, telling him to marry \\"that nice girl, Debbie\\" and \\"give your child a name, not like your poor, half-sister, Joh'Vonnie\\". The words resonated with the singer, who did not want to repeat his father's sins.Taraborrelli, pp. 585‚Äì587 Prior to Katherine's words, the view had been for Rowe to act as a surrogate mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a friendly favor and he would raise it. Jackson intended to issue a statement, following the birth, that the identity of the mother was a secret, in the same way that the identities of many surrogates are protected. However, Katherine's involvement influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day. Wedding Jackson and Rowe wed on November 13, 1996, at the Sheraton on the Park Hotel in Sydney, Australia. The night before the wedding, Jackson had called Presley, who gave him and Rowe her blessing. In front of 15 friends, the pair exchanged vows at the hotel. An 8-year-old boy named Anthony, who was Jackson's nephew, served as the best man during the ceremony. For the occasion, Jackson had put special effort into his appearance.Taraborrelli, pp. 588‚Äì590 Media and public reaction to the marriage was negative and cynical. Some commentators believed Jackson was marrying a person he did not love, and Rowe was having a baby who may not have been biologically Jackson's. The Daily Mirror, a British tabloid newspaper, published a photograph of Rowe on the balcony of an Australian hotel. In it, she is seen holding her head in her hands. One Jackson biographer stated that the woman's dismayed and exasperated pose was most probably due to the excessive presence of paparazzi below. The Daily Mirror ran the photograph while mockingly proclaiming, \\"Oh, God! I've Just Married Michael Jackson.\\" Birth of Michael Jackson, Jr. Jackson and Rowe's first child together, Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. (also known as \\"Prince\\"), was born on February 13, 1997, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.Grant, p. 193 The baby was nicknamed after Michael's grandfather and great-grandfather, who were both called Prince.Pinkerton, p. 47 After Rowe and Jackson cut the baby's umbilical cord together, Prince was taken to intensive care, where he spent five hours with only minor problems. He was subsequently taken by his father to Neverland Ranch. Prince's mother recuperated at a friend's house, upon her release from the hospital. Six weeks after the birth, Rowe saw her son for the first time since his birth. She had met with Jackson to pose for photographs with their newborn son at a hotel. Upon arriving, Rowe was ushered into the hotel room, where she was given the infant to hold and told to smile for the camera with Michael. Afterward, she was sent on her way. Rowe did not want to become too attached to Prince, as she felt it would make her situation harder to deal with. At Neverland, Prince was cared for by a team of six nannies and six nurses during his first few months. According to one nanny who worked at the Californian ranch, Prince's mother was not a significant presence in the child's early life. \\"I saw her maybe three times and she seemed very sullen.\\"Taraborrelli, p. 591 Second pregnancy and birth of Paris-Michael Jackson Rowe announced that she was pregnant with Jackson's second child in November 1997.Taraborrelli, pp. 597‚Äì600 The baby was to be a girl and named Paris, after the French city in which her parents said she was conceived. On April 3, 1998, blue-eyed Paris Michael Katherine Jackson was born. Her middle names come from Michael and his mother, Katherine. Jackson later claimed that he was so anxious following the birth of his daughter, that he \\"snatched\\" her and ran straight home \\"with all the placenta and everything all over her\\". Rowe later confirmed that Jackson had the placenta frozen.Taraborrelli, p. 603 Following the birth, Jackson's associates contacted Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in Rome, in the hope that the Pontiff would personally baptize the pop star's daughter. An official for the Pope informed Jackson by letter that the leader of the Catholic Church would not participate in what may be perceived as a publicity stunt. Divorce Feeling uncomfortable with their arrangement, Rowe asked Jackson for a divorce, which he granted on October 8, 1999. Rowe received around $10 million in a settlement, which started with an immediate payment of $1.5 million. With the divorce, Rowe gave Jackson full custody rights to her children. At the time, both Rowe and Jackson requested privacy and asked the public not to speculate on the reasons for their divorce. They concluded that despite coming to the end of married life, they would continue to remain friends. Birth of Prince Michael Michael Jackson with his three children in 2006. The eldest two were born by Debbie Rowe. Following the divorce, Jackson would go on to have a third child. Prince Michael was born on February 21, 2002, to an unnamed surrogate mother. Rowe said that she was not the biological mother of Prince Michael, who is nicknamed \\"Blanket\\". Jackson stated that the baby was produced through artificial insemination using his own sperm cells. He further said that he did not know the mother, and she did not know him, and that in asking for a surrogate mother, he did not care how old she was or what race she was. It did, however, matter to him that she was intelligent, healthy, and had uncorrected eyesight. In the television documentary, The Michael Jackson Interview: The Footage You Were Never Meant to See, a rebuttal video to the Martin Bashir interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), Rowe attempted to explain her relationship with Jackson and their two children:Taraborrelli, pp. 607‚Äì608 > \\"My kids don't call me Mom because I don't want them to. They're Michael's > children. It's not that they are not my children, but I had them because I > wanted him to be a father. People make remarks, 'I can't believe she left > her children.' Left them? I left my children? I did not leave my children. > My children are with their father, where they are supposed to be. I didn't > do it to be a mother... If he called me tonight and said let's have five > more [children], I'd do it in a heartbeat.\\" In 2006, Rowe legally applied for her access to her two children to be reinstated, and subsequently reached an agreement with Jackson. Following the singer's death in 2009, his mother Katherine was made the permanent guardian of Prince, Paris, and their half-brother Prince Michael. In addition, a new custody arrangement was made with Rowe, who had visitation rights with her two children and continued to receive spousal support payments. Regarding questions as to whether Jackson is the biological father of his three children, which first became a matter of discussion after it was reported that his son, Prince, had \\"white skin,\\" Jackson stated in 2003 that the children are biologically his. Allegations regarding sexuality Despite his relationships with women, Jackson's sexuality was the subject of speculation and controversy for decades. The pop singer faced allegations of being gay since he was a teenager, as well as later being labelled asexual.Taraborrelli, pp. 156‚Äì158 One 1970s newspaper story alleged that the then 19-year-old singer was to have a sex change operation and marry the songwriter Clifton Davis. Jackson found out about the story from a crying fan. The musician reassured the girl that the tale was untrue and condemned it as a \\"stupid rumor\\". The story circulated for many months, during which time Jackson became upset; he was raised in a family where homosexuality was considered sinful. Jackson would continue to deny being gay throughout his life. In a 1979 interview, the pop star stated that he was not gay and that he would not \\"have a nervous breakdown because people think I like having sex with men\\". He added that if he let the rumor affect him, it would make him cheap and make it sound as if he was prejudiced against gay people. He expressed that many of his fans may be gay, and that he did not mind that, opining \\"That's their lives and this is mine.\\" 1993 child sexual abuse allegations In 1993, Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan. To the father's disapproval, his son had become friends with the musician in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan, a dentist, Jordan said that Jackson had touched his penis.Taraborrelli, pp. 485‚Äì486 Evan was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement.Taraborrelli, pp. 477‚Äì478Campbell, p. 53 Jordan then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex.Taraborrelli, pp. 496‚Äì498 Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the State closed its criminal investigation, citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. A few months after Jackson's death in 2009, Evan committed suicide.https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael- jackson-5-1197806https://people.com/celebrity/father-of-alleged-michael- jackson-molestation-victim-kills- himself/http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/18/jackson.accuser.suicide/index.html 2003 child sexual abuse allegations Further accusations of child sexual abuse were made in 2003, by 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo. The allegations came after Jackson and the boy appeared in the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, in which the entertainer stated that he shared his bed with children in a non-sexual fashion. The singer was subsequently indicted on four counts of molesting a minor, four counts of intoxicating a minor, one count of abduction, and one count of conspiring to hold the boy and his family captive at Neverland Ranch. During the five-month trial, Jackson faced allegations of child molestation and assertions that he had attempted to abduct the Arvizo family in a hot air balloon. He denied all the charges, and family members proclaimed that he was the victim of an extortion attempt. One friend, Firpo Carr, expressed amazement at the allegations leveled against the singer, who at the time was living at Neverland Ranch. \\"I'm surprised they haven't accused him of bestiality because he also has a zoo there. I mean, it gets ridiculous after a while.\\" On June 13, 2005, the jury found Jackson not guilty on all charges. 2013 and 2014 child sexual abuse allegations In May 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit against Jackson's estate for child sexual abuse. The date for the hearing which would determine whether or not Robson could sue Jackson's estate, was scheduled for June 2, 2014. Robson met Jackson when he was five years old. In 2005, he had testified in Jackson's defense during his child molestation trial. At that trial, Jackson's former housekeeper Blanca Francia had testified that she had witnessed Robson showering with Jackson when the boy was 8 or 9 years old. In his 2013 filing, Robson claimed that by the time he was seven years old, he was regularly having sleepovers at Jackson's Neverland Ranch and at Jackson's homes in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which lasted until he was 14, and that Jackson sexually abused him throughout the seven-year period. The attorney for Jackson's estate described Robson's claim as \\"outrageous and pathetic\\". In December 2017, the lawsuit against Jackson's corporations were dropped, with Judge Mitchell L. Beckloff stating that the corporations were not liable to any alleged damages against Robson. Two years prior, Beckloff dismissed an earlier lawsuit against Jackson's estate, stating that Robson waited too long to file. On January 25, 2019, the four-hour documentary Leaving Neverland, directed by Dan Reed, was screened at the Sundance Film Festival. It contains interviews of Robson and James Safechuck. The film was shown on HBO in the US and Channel 4 in the UK in March. The estate dismissed the new allegations. In 2019, an appeals court revived Robson's and Safechuck's lawsuits against Jackson's corporations following a change in California law expanding the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse lawsuits.

History  The fossils in the cave were investigated by noted 19th-century palaeontologists Edward Drinker Cope, Henry C. Mercer, and Charles M. Wheatley. Some of the fossils, such as an unnamed member of the beetle genus of Dicaelus are unique to this cave and have not been identified elsewhere. The cave was originally discovered by limestone miners in the 19th century. It was later filled in with asbestos-bearing industrial refuse and the cave's location was lost. The village of Port Kennedy was largely demolished in the 1960s during construction of the U.S. Route 422 Expressway. The tract containing the cave became part of the Valley Forge National Historical Park in 1978. In 2005, the National Park Service and geologists rediscovered the cave. It has been rumored that the quarry near where the cave is located near holds a crashed locomotive, which was used in the shooting of a now lost silent film in 1915, The Valley of Lost Hope.

Ednam is in the old county of Roxburghshire now part of the Scottish Borders Council. Ednam is NNE of Kelso on the B6461 road and is at  History  Thorlongus or Thor Longus ('Thor the Tall') was the first recorded laird of Ednaham, (from the Old English, 'Settlement on the Eden Water') as Ednam was known. This area is the first known parish in Scotland and was believed to be the start of King Edgar of Scotland's attempt at 'devolved management' to local people. There has been, at least, three churches at Ednam with the first being founded in 1105 in a charter issued by Thor Longus and dedicated St. Cuthbert. Such was the importance of the church, it became known as 'the mother church of Hedenham' The 12th. century church survived until 1523 when it was destroyed by the English in a cross border raid after which, the church was re-built. Another early religious establishment at Ednam, St. Leonard's hospital and chapel, was founded in the reign of William I of Scotland (1165-1214) when Ada de Warenne or Northumberland, William's mother, gave the hospital to the master and congregation. In 1392 Robert III of Scotland gave the establishment to his sister and her husband, John Edmondstoune, as a marriage gift. The Edmonstounes would be proprietors of Ednam for the next 250 years. The holy hospital was damaged beyond repair. by the English in 1542 and again in 1544. The field where the hospital was situated is still known as the Spital field. The church of 1523 was described, in 1680, as being in a ruinous condition and in need of re-building. The new church, built in a slightly different position, was used until 1820 when yet another church was built. Then, in 1902, that church was substantially renovated and added to. The improvements included a chancel, a porch and a vestry for the minister's use and the work was designed and undertaken by the Edinburgh firm of architects, Hardy and Wight. A copy of Thor's charter of 1105 to the monks of Durham is contained in the church at Ednam.  Post-Reformation  In 1560, at the onset of the Scottish Reformation, the monks left and the mass was banned but it was 39 years before Ednam had a resident minister. The services on the Sabbath and the administration of sacraments were conducted by men known as 'Readers'. In 1599, Rev. Thomas Porteous was ordained as the first Protestant minister at Ednam then in 1617, John Clapperton was appointed but he appeared to favour a more Episcopalian approach and supported the bishops. In 1637, Archbishop Laud and Charles I of Scotland, England and Ireland, introduced the Book of Common Prayer to Scotland which universally denounced by the people of Scotland. When the National Covenant of Scotland was signed at Greyfriar's Kirk in Edinburgh in February 1638, Clapperton was ousted from the post and a Presbyterian minister, John Somerville appointed. Charles I, however, intervened and John Clapperton was reinstated. John Somerville returned the post again in 1639 and preached at Ednam Kirk until 1660 when Charles II of Scotland and England re- introduced the hated prayer book. Robert Young was then appointed the 'vicar of Ednam' where he remained until 1668. Young was soon followed as vicar by Adam Peacock but the congregated still demanded a return to the National Covenant. Adam Peacock was in charge until 1683 when William Speed became the new preacher. In 1688, and the enthronement of William of Orange and his wife, Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, William Speed wasted no time in departing the post in the knowledge that the Anglican Common Book of Prayer would soon be banned in Scotland's kirks.

The film includes performances by Nicole Lewis, Daniel von Bargen (in his final performance), Russ Russo, and director Seymour, as well as narration by Clint Howard. London Betty made the list of \\"Top Films of the Year\\" on Moviesmademe.com in 2009. Originally having a theatrical release in 2009, the film was released on DVD in 2010 through Maverick Entertainment on their Platinum Label. In May 2011 London Betty hit the #3 spot for British comedy on Amazon on Demand. The film was nationally distributed at Blockbuster Video until the company went out of business in 2013. Director Tom Seymour affectionately referred to this film and his two other features as the \\"Backyard Trilogy\\" consisting of Everything Moves Alone, Land of College Prophets and London Betty. The three films all involve backyard thieves or in the case of Land of College Prophets superheroes that all dwell in suburban environments all shot within central Connecticut. Background Plot London Betty (Nicole Lewis) is the plucky British journalist who gets a newspaper job in the small American town of Pharisee. But trying to get an audience with her elusive, agoraphobic publisher Maury (Daniel von Bargen) is only part of her problem. Her first story requires the toppling of the corrupt and perverted administration run by Mayor Plumb (Dick Boland) and his band of off-kilter hoodlums. However, Betty has unlikely allies to help her bring down the mayor: a pair of petty thieves, Volga (Russ Russo) and Billy (Thomas Edward Seymour), a golden-hearted prostitute Jess (Margaret Rose Champagne) and a transvestite ex-Marine hitman, Sgt. Stone (Phil Hall). Partial cast * Clint Howard as Narrator (voice) * Daniel von Bargen as Maury * Thomas Edward Seymour as Billy * Russ Russo as Volgo * Phil Hall as Sgt.

It is named after Maurice Fr√©chet. Karcher mean is the renaming of the Riemannian Center of Mass construction developed by Karsten Grove and Hermann Karcher... On the real numbers, the arithmetic mean, median, geometric mean, and harmonic mean can all be interpreted as Fr√©chet means for different distance functions. Definition Let (M, d) be a complete metric space. Let x1, x2, ‚Ä¶, xN be random points in M. For any point p in M, define the Fr√©chet variance to be the sum of squared distances from p to the xi: :\\\\Psi(p) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N d^2\\\\left(p, x_i\\\\right) The Karcher means are then those points, m of M, which locally minimise Œ®: :m = \\\\mathop{\\\\text{arg min}}_{p \\\\in M} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N d^2\\\\left(p, x_i\\\\right) If there is an m of M that globally minimises Œ®, then it is Fr√©chet mean. Sometimes, the xi are assigned weights wi. Then, the Fr√©chet variance is calculated as a weighted sum, :\\\\Psi(p) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i d^2\\\\left(p, x_i\\\\right), \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; m = \\\\mathop{\\\\text{arg min}}_{p \\\\in M} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i d^2\\\\left(p, x_i\\\\right). Examples of Fr√©chet means  Arithmetic mean and median  For real numbers, the arithmetic mean is a Fr√©chet mean, using the usual Euclidean distance as the distance function. The median is also a Fr√©chet mean, if the definition of the function Œ® is generalized to the non-quadratic :\\\\Psi(p) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N d^\\\\alpha\\\\left(p, x_i\\\\right), where \\\\alpha=1, and the Euclidean distance is the distance function d., p. 136. In higher-dimensional spaces, this becomes the geometric median. Geometric mean On the positive real numbers, the (hyperbolic) distance function d(x,y)=  \\\\log(x) - \\\\log(y)  can be defined. The geometric mean is the corresponding Fr√©chet mean. Indeed f:x\\\\mapsto e^x is then an isometry from the euclidean space to this \\"hyperbolic\\" space and must respect the Fr√©chet mean: the Fr√©chet mean of the x_i is the image by f of the Fr√©chet mean (in the Euclidean sense) of the f^{-1}(x_i), i.e. it must be: : f\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n f^{-1}\\\\left(x_i\\\\right)\\\\right) = \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\log x_i \\\\right) = \\\\sqrt[n]{x_1 \\\\cdots x_n}. Harmonic mean On the positive real numbers, the metric (distance function): : d_\\\\operatorname{H}(x,y) = \\\\left \\\\frac{1}{x} - \\\\frac{1}{y} \\\\right can be defined. The harmonic mean is the corresponding Fr√©chet mean. Power means Given a non-zero real number m, the power mean can be obtained as a Fr√©chet mean by introducing the metric : d_m\\\\left(x, y\\\\right) = \\\\left x^m - y^m \\\\right f-mean Given an invertible and continuous function f, the f-mean can be defined as the Fr√©chet mean obtained by using the metric: : d_f(x,y) = \\\\leftf(x) - f(y)\\\\right This is sometimes called the generalised f-mean or quasi-arithmetic mean. Weighted means The general definition of the Fr√©chet mean that includes the possibility of weighting observations can be used to derive weighted versions for all of the above types of means.

Louis- Nicolas Robert (2 December 1761 ‚Äì 8 August 1828) was a French soldier and mechanical engineer, who is credited with a paper-making invention that became the blueprint of the Fourdrinier machine. In 1799, Robert patented the first machine to produce 'continuous paper'. After a series of legal and financial quarrels with Saint-L√©ger Didot, Robert lost control of his patent. The machine was then shipped out of post-revolutionary France and further developed in England. Robert's invention became the core of the Fourdrinier machine, the basis for modern papermaking. He eventually became a school- teacher and died in penury. Early and family life Louis-Nicolas Robert was born to aging parents on rue Neuve-Saint-Eustache, 1st arrondissement of Paris. As a child he was physically frail and self-conscious, but studious and ambitious. He received an excellent education with a strong focus on science and mathematics at the hands of the religious order of the Minimes. He felt guilty for being a financial burden to his parents. At the age of 15, he tried to enlist in the army in order to support the American Revolution, but was rejected. He was accepted into the military four years later. On 23 April 1780 he joined the First Battalion of the Grenoble Artillery, and was subsequently stationed in Calais. In 1781 he transferred to the Metz Artillery regiment and was sent to Saint-Domingue, where he fought the English. He served in the military for 14 years (circa 1794), and rose to the rank of Sergeant Major. Another account of Robert's military career suggests that he left the army aged 28, in 1790. Robert married Charlotte Routier on 11 November 1794, in a civil ceremony. The ceremony was civil because of the post-Revolutionary decree that marriage be a simple civil contract, certified by a municipal officer. Paper manufacture machine Workers making paper by hand In 1790, having finished with his military career, Robert became an indentured clerk at one of the Didot family's renowned Paris publishing houses. First working under Saint-L√©ger Didot as a clerk, he later switched to a position as \\"inspector of personnel\\" at Pierre-Fran√ßois Didot's paper-making factory in Corbeil-Essonnes. This well-respected establishment had a history dating back to 1355 and supplied paper to the Ministry of Finance for currency manufacture. Both Robert and Didot grew impatient with the quarrelling workers, vatmen, couchers, and laymen, so Robert was spurred to look for a mechanical solution to the manual labour of the paper-making process. In his book Papermaking: the History and Technique of an Ancient Craft, Dard Hunter reported that: Although Didot judged Robert's first plans to be \\"feeble\\", they showed enough promise to continue research, and Didot financed a small prototype model. This was completed by 1797, but it was also deemed a failure. Robert became discouraged, so Didot appointed him \\"superintendent of grain grinding\\" at a nearby flour mill. After a few months' rest from the paper factory, Didot encouraged Robert to reprise the paper machine, and put several mechanics at his disposal. The next model showed some improvement, and Didot therefore instructed Robert to make a full-size model, scaling-up to the popular 24 inch 'Colombier' width. This machine was a success and produced two sheets of \\"well felted\\" paper. Patent application Following Robert's successful model, built in 1798, Saint-L√©ger Didot insisted that Robert apply for a patent. Prior to 1798, paper was made one sheet at a time, by dipping a rectangular frame or mould with a screen bottom into a vat of pulp. The frame was removed from the vat, and the water was pressed out of the pulp. The remaining pulp was allowed to dry; the frame could not be re-used until the previous sheet of paper was removed from it. Robert's construction had a moving screen belt that would receive a continuous flow of stock and deliver an unbroken sheet of wet paper to a pair of squeeze rolls. As the continuous strip of wet paper came off the machine it was manually hung over a series of cables or bars to dry. With Didot's urging, Robert and Didot went to Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau, the Minister of the Interior and applied for a patent. In 1799, the patent (brevet d'invention) was granted by the French Government, for which Robert paid 8,000 francs. The patent specification and application for the continuous paper-making machine is published in the second volume of the Brevets d'Inventions Expir√©s. On 9 September 1798 (23 Fructidor Year VI) Robert wrote a letter applying for a patent: De Neufch√¢teau authorised the Bureau of Arts and Trades (Bureau des Arts et M√©tiers) to send a draughtsman, Monsieur Beauvelot, to Essonnes to document and build an improved model. The minister also authorised a member of the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers to accompany him. The Bureau des Arts et M√©tiers then declared: The Conservatoire des Arts et M√©tiers paid Robert three thousand francs to build another model for permanent display at the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers. In 1785, Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf invented the first machine for printing dyes on squares of wallpaper. The significance of Robert's invention was for more than mechanising a labour-intensive process, in also allowing continuous lengths of patterned and coloured paper to be produced for hanging. This offered the prospect of novel designs and nice tints to be printed and displayed in drawing rooms across Europe. Development in England Large Fourdrinier- style paper-making machine Robert and Didot quarrelled over the ownership of the invention. Robert eventually sold both the patent and the prototype machine to Didot for 25,000 francs. Didot defaulted on the payments to Robert, however, and he was forced to recover legal ownership of the patent on 23 June 1801. Didot wanted to develop and patent the machine in England, away from the distractions of the French Revolution, so he sent his English brother-in-law, John Gamble, to London. In March 1801, after demonstrating continuous rolls of paper from Essonne, John Gamble agreed to share the London patent application with brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, who ran a leading stationery house. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801 for an improved version of Robert's original machine. Thus the next development was financed by the London stationers. Gamble and Didot shipped the machine to London, and after 6 years and approximately ¬£60,000 of development costs, the Fourdriniers were awarded new patents. An example of the Fourdrinier machine was installed at Frogmore, Hertfordshire. Death and commemoration In 1812, in poor health, having both sold and lost control of his invention and the patent, with further exploitation being concentrated in England, Robert retired from paper-making and left Corbeil-Essonnes. He moved to Vernouillet, Eure-et-Loir and opened a small school, Faubourg St Thibault. The French economy was very depressed after Napoleon's defeats, and Robert was very poorly paid. He continued teaching until his death on 8 August 1828. A statue of him stands in front of the church in Vernouillet, and the \\"Coll√®ge de Louis-Nicolas Robert\\" in the quartier des Grandes Vauvettes is named in his honour. In 1976, Leonard Schlosser discovered Robert's original drawings at auction and made facsimiles for scholars and friends. It is not now known where the original drawings can be seen.

Membership  The association's membership consists of career colleges operating within the province of Ontario, and the member campuses are obligated to adhere to the CCO member's code of ethics. CCO career colleges deliver career-specific, outcome-based programs in hundreds of essential skilled fields in a manner that is characteristically responsive to employer demand. Graduates of career colleges earn a diploma or a certificate for a wide range of programs in fields like business, health services, human services, applied arts, information technology, electronics, services and the trades. Over 43,000 students enroll in an Ontario career college each year. Member institutions are afforded access to association advocacy, resources, and services through the following benefits:  Advocacy  * CCO meets regularly with the Ministry of Colleges and Universities and attends government events to inform and advise officials on issues prudent to the sector. * CCO submits recommendations to the government on policy that impacts its members and their students. * The association serves as the voice of the career colleges, conveying emerging sector issues to the ministry while educating and supporting its membership on regulatory matters the ministry imposes.  Services  * Transcript storage at a reduced rate. * The opportunity to process OSAP applications through the association's Financial Aid Office. * Receive notices and information on matters that affect Ontario's career colleges. * The association organizes or sponsors workshops and emergency meetings for the sector as needed. * Career Colleges Ontario hosts a yearly conference consisting of informational seminars, workshops, and networking events for career college professionals. During the conference, the association presents its CCO Awards, recognizing outstanding graduates and the instructors dedicated to providing their students with the greatest opportunities to succeed.  Resources  * As part of its mandate to inform government and the public on the value and role career colleges play in Ontario's post-secondary education framework, CCO frequently engages with and responds to enquiries from bureaucrats, MPPs, and the media. * Members gain access to an extensive network of career college professionals and consultants to ascertain best practices for program delivery and operations.  Advocacy work   Mission  To promote an environment where quality career colleges in Ontario and their students succeed by helping governments, key decision-makers and the public understand the critical role they play in supporting Ontario‚Äôs post-secondary education system and improving the province‚Äôs economic well-being.  Removing barriers for career college students  The typical career college student is distinct from the average student who attends a public institution. The majority enrolled at career colleges are mature students over the age of 30. The career college demographic consists of an overwhelming population of women and first- generation immigrants. They are our motivated, often require individual supports provided through small class sizes, and are seeking training or retraining in order to improve their lives with a new career. The experience, needs and financial obligations of career college students are far from comparable to your average public institution student fresh out of high school. Yet regulation often lumps the two demographics together or outright excludes career college students from opportunities solely due to their choice in an institution they felt best suited to meet their needs.  Regulation  Career colleges in Ontario are registered with the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. The legislation that governs the sector is called the Private Career Colleges Act 2005. As of 2019, there are over 600 registered private career colleges in more than 70 Ontario communities. CCO's Financial Aid Office operates in partnership with the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities and the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) office. CCO's Financial Aid Office is authorized by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities to act as a provider of transcript maintenance and issuance services.  Governance  Career Colleges Ontario consists of independent staff operating under the direction of its chief executive officer. The association's mandate and directives are set by an elected Board of Directors that consists of 16 volunteer board members. Members of the board are representatives from Ontario career college institutions of varying size. The diversity of the board ensures CCO is positioned to best meet the needs of its membership.

Supporter of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I and archbishop and primate of Poland Jakub ≈öwinka, he initiated the construction of the Wawel Cathedral. In 1337 he excommunicated John of Bohemia. Biography Jan Ko≈Çda was born in around 1270 in Kamie≈Ñ, a Polish garrison at Rozbark silver mines at the eastern border of the Duchy of Bytom. In 1304 he was Archdeacon of Sandomierz From 1305-1307 studied, Canon law at the University in Bologna, Italy which was a centre of legal scholarship. In 1318 he returned to Poland and was appointed by the Chancellor of St. Mary's Church, and Dean of the chapter of Krak√≥w. As Bishop of Krakow he set out the diocesan statutes, and initiated the construction of the Gothic Cathedral on the Wawel Hill.

Gillis Field House is fully equipped with locker rooms for both teams and also features coaches offices and a fully equipped training room. Gillis Field House is named for Maj. William G. Gillis. As a member of the West Point Class of 1941, cadet lieutenant Gillis was captain of the 1940 football team and a three-year track letterman. He was killed in action October 1, 1944 in Gremercy Forest in France during WW II. When he died, Gillis was married to Lenore Riley Mudge. Gillis received the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, as well as the British Distinguished Service Order, and France‚Äôs Croix De Guerre, Silver Gilt and Vermillion Star.

History Bun Abhainn Eadarra is notable for containing the remains of an historic whaling station which was founded by a Norwegian, Carl Herlofsen, in 1904. The company was operational until 1914 and again from 1918 to 1922, when it was bought by Lever Brothers, the company founded and run by William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme, the Isle of Lewis's proprietor. The machines were renewed and three ships for whaling in the North Atlantic were bought. The main product was whale oil, which was used in making soap and margarine and also for lighting and lubricants. Shortly before closure of the site in 1929, a building was added to smoke whalemeat for sale in the Congo. The station reopened for a brief period in the 1950s.

Rare but widely distributed, it is found in the Indo-Pacific from Mozambique to India to northern Australia. This species may be semi-pelagic in nature, inhabiting both deeper waters and shallow coastal reefs and estuaries. It is characterized by a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc much wider than long, a tail that is broad and flattened in front of the spine but whip-like behind, and large white spots over its back. The very wide shape of the smalleye stingray differs from that of most other members of its family, and may reflect a mode of swimming similar to other rays such as manta rays. This species is aplacental viviparous, with litter sizes perhaps as small as one pup. A handful of smalleye stingrays are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries across its range. At present there is insufficient data for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to determine its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. Taxonomy The type specimen of the smalleye stingray; note the distinctive shape. In 1908, Scottish zoologist Nelson Annandale described the smalleye stingray as Trygon microps, in the second volume of Records of the Indian Museum. He based his account on a large specimen collected from a depth of in the Bay of Bengal, near Chittagong, Bangladesh. Later authors synonymized the genus Trygon with DasyatisCatalog of Fishes (Online Version). California Academy of Sciences. Retrieved on January 9, 2010.. Megatrygon has since been created and assigned as the genus for this species, although molecular data may suggest it is actually more closely related to the Neotropical stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) and round rays (Urotrygonidae). Distribution and habitat The smalleye stingray is widely but possibly discontinuously distributed in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, having been reported from off Tofo in Mozambique, Mal√© in the Maldives, the coasts of India and Bangladesh, the Gulf of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, the Arafura Sea, and possibly the Philippines. This species has been reported from inshore habitats and river mouths, including the Ganges River estuary, as well as from deeper water; it is uncertain which is its preferred habitat. At Tofo, smalleye stingrays have been seen swimming over reefs at a depth of , where the water temperature is . Although it had been presumed to be bottom-dwelling, these observations of individuals in mid-water suggest that the smalleye stingray may in fact be semi-pelagic in nature. Description The smalleye stingray has a distinctive shape among its family: the pectoral fin disc is more than 1.4 times wider than long, with the outer corners forming obtuse angles. The anterior margins of the disc are sinuous and converge on a rounded snout with a slightly projecting tip. The eyes are small and immediately followed by a pair of much larger spiracles. The mouth is wide and contains five papillae across the floor. The tail is not quite as long as the disc, and is broad and flattened from its base to the stinging spine. The tail spine of one specimen examined measured long and bore 75 serrations. After the spine, the tail abruptly becomes thin and cylindrical, with a low, thick fin fold running underneath. The upper surface of the disc is covered by many large dermal denticles with star-shaped bases, concentrated on the snout. This ray is brown to reddish brown above, darkening towards the tip of the tail, and white below, becoming slightly dusky at the fin margins and on the tail. The dorsal surface bears characteristic large white spots beside the eyes, around the disc center, and in a row on either side about two-thirds of the way to the pectoral fin tips. There is also a row of small white spots on either side of the tail base. One of the largest stingray species, the smalleye stingray can reach a disc width of and a total length of . Biology and ecology The disc shape of the smalleye stingray suggests that it may swim in a fashion unlike other stingrays and more akin to other rays with very broad pectoral fin discs (such as butterfly or manta rays), i.e., flapping its pectoral fins up and down rather than undulating the pectoral fin margins; this species would thus represent a case of convergent evolution with those ray families. Off Tofo, most individuals are accompanied by multiple cobia (Rachycentron canadum). A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Oncomegoides celatus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. As with other stingrays, the smalleye stingray is aplacental viviparous with the developing embryos being sustained by yolk and later histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") secreted by the mother. There is a record of a female gestating a single late-term fetus, which exhibited the same spotted color pattern as the adult. Newborn rays likely measure across. Human interactions The smalleye stingray appears to be very rare across much of its range, perhaps explained by its possible semi-pelagic habits. It is only encountered with any regularity at the reefs off Tofo Beach, where in 2009 a living individual was captured on film underwater for the first time by a BBC crew. This species is an occasional incidental catch of demersal longline, bottom trawl, trammel net, and seine net fisheries throughout its range. There is also a record of one being speared by artisanal fishers in Mozambique. The meat, cartilage, and possibly skin are of value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough information to assess the smalleye stingray beyond Data Deficient. Intensive fishing occurs in much of this ray's range and its large size may render it vulnerable, though if it favors deeper water that may confer some protection.

At EWSC the 800 foot long building was home to a gymnasium and swimming pool.April 28, 1977 Cheney Free Press, Cheney Washington, Vol. 80, No. 49, Pg 1 & 6 Demolition In the fall of 1976 the building was condemned for life safety code violations.Cheney Free Press, Cheney Washington, April 28, 1977, page 6 EWSC contracted with George Kelp Building Wrecking Company of Spokane for the building's demolition. Old bolts in the building's roof construction could not be removed without cutting them out, and therefore a welder's torch was used.April 25, 1977, Cheney Free Press, researched and compiled by,Susan L. Ferguson in 1993 The fire At 11:10am, the Cheney fire department got the call that the Fieldhouse was on fire. Twice before, small fires had been accidentally started by the demolition team. But this fire was different. The fire was started when a spark from a welder's torch found fuel in a pile of the building's dismantled material. With more than half the roof already removed, a \\"wind tunnel\\" effect was created as the fire pulled in the oxygen it needed to quickly grow. By 11:12am, the fire chief was on the scene and sounded a mutual aid alarm. More than 30 firefighters from around the district responded. Within 10 minutes, the entire Fieldhouse was engulfed in flames. The blaze was so hot that reportedly cars parked almost 100 feet away were \\"scorched.\\" A Cheney fire truck was even damaged by the heat. The firefighters, realizing the building was a complete loss, focused on containment and protecting the surrounding buildings. The fire wasn't under control until 2:00pm. But winds in the area required crews to remain on scene an additional 12 hours.April 25, 1977, Cheney Free Press, researched and compiled by Susan L. Ferguson in 1993 In addition to the regular firefighters, there were many students involved. There were 2 fire hoses between the fieldhouse and the ROTC building. These were entirely manned by students. Their primary responsibility was protecting the ROTC building. At times they had to turn the hoses up into the eaves of the ROTC building's roof as fires had started there due to the heat. Other groups of students were using garden hoses to wet down those who were on the fire hoses. The heat between the buildings was quite high. Without the cooling from the garden hoses, the students on the fire hoses would not have been able to stay in there as they did not have firefighter's turnouts for protection. John Slaughter, a student on one of the fire hoses. The aftermath of the fire The Cheney Fire Department Chief Tony Singleton estimated that fire damage to the department's equipment exceeded $6,000. Total damage figures for the ROTC building came out at over $25,000 according to Singleton. The ROTC building's roof was so badly damaged that classes had to be held in another building for nearly a year.The Easterner, EWSC Cheney, Wash. Thursday 28, 1977, Vol. 28, No. 25 page 1 Sixteen firemen were treated for smoke inhalation and one fireman was treated for a cut on his hand.

In 1982, their Conestoga 1 rocket became the first privately funded rocket to reach space. In October 1995, their first (and only) attempt at an orbital launch, Conestoga 1620, failed to achieve orbit due to a guidance system failureFurniss, Tim (October 31 1995). \\"First Conestoga booster explodes after launch\\", Flightglobal.com. Accessed 1 June 2020 46 seconds into its flight. The parent company, EER Systems, subsequently folded and the Conestoga program was cancelled. History SSIA was founded in 1980 by David Hannah.Guide to the Space Services, Inc. records, 1970s-1990s MS 584 Percheron development The company initially started in the launch systems with a design by Gary Hudson, the Percheron, which was intended to dramatically lower the price of space launches. Key to the design was a simple pressure-fed kerosene-oxidizer engine that was intended to reduce the costs associated with \\"throwing away\\" the booster. Various loads could be accommodated by clustering the basic modules together. SSIA conducted an engine test firing of the Percheron from Matagorda Island on August 5, 1981, but the rocket exploded on the pad due to a malfunction. SSIA then parted ways with Hudson. Conestoga development Conestoga I prepared for launch. SSIA founder David Hannah then hired Deke Slayton, one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts. Slayton had just left NASA after running (among earlier roles) the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing validation testing. They came up with an entire new design based on clustering engines from the second stage of the Minuteman missile. The first launch of the new Conestoga I design took place on 9 Sep 1982, consisting of the core missile stage and a 500 kg dummy payload which included 40 gallons of water. The payload was successfully ejected at 313 km, and the Conestoga I became the first privately funded rocket to reach space. SSIA was purchased by EER Systems in December 1990. The design was modified again, this time using the Castor engines originally used on the Scout, a workhorse of the 1960s. The new design was known as the Conestoga 1620, or by other numbers depending on the number and arrangement of the boosters. The first orbital launch of Conestoga 1620 was to carry a NASA payload, the first flight of the Commercial Experiment Transporter (COMET) payload concept. On 23 October 1995 the COMET (now known as METEOR) and Conestoga 1620 was finally ready for launch. The launch took place from the NASA Wallops Flight Facility; the rocket launched normally, but broke up by ground command after a guidance system failure 46 seconds after launch. The failure was later determined to be due to loss of hydraulic fluid due to excessive use of the control thrusters responding to noise in the flight control system. It was purchased by L-3 Communications in 2001 for $110 million.

Biography  Okhotin was born in Chita, into a military family. In 1916 his father, poruchik Pavel Okhotin, died. His mother, Nadezhda, married a section chief of the Chita police, Aleksandr Petrovich Melnikov, in 1919. In August 1920 the family emigrated from the Soviet Union to Manchuria. Okhotin first met Konstantin Rodzaevsky, founder of the Russian Fascist Party, in Harbin in 1932. At the end of 1933, as a student of the Harbin Teacher's Institute, Okhotin joined the Party and remained a member until 1943. Starting in 1935, Okhotin served as the business manager and then office manager of the Russian Fascist Party. In late 1936 he was appointed head of the organizational department of the Party. From 1937 to 1943 was a member of the Supreme Council.  Arrest and trial Okhotin was arrested by SMERSH, the Russian counter-intelligence department, on 7 September 1945. For almost a year, SMERSH agents and the Ministry for State Security conducted an investigation. Defendants in one case were combined as follows: Grigory Semyonov, Konstantin Rodzaevsky, General Lev Vlasyevsky, General Alexey Baksheev, Ivan A. Mikhailov (Minister of Finance in the Government of Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak), Lev Okhotin, Prince Nikolay Ukhtomsky, and Boris Shepunov. The trial began on 26 August 1946, and was widely reported in the Soviet press. The trial was opened by Vasiliy Ulrikh, the Chairman of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. The defendants were charged with anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda, espionage against the Soviet Union, sabotage, and terrorism. All the defendants pleaded guilty. On 30 August 1946, the Military Collegium found the defendants guilty, and Okhotin, along with Prince Ukhtomsky, \\"given their relatively smaller role in the anti-Soviet activities\\", were sentenced to 15 and 20 year terms in a work camp respectively. Okhotin died in a camp in 1948. On 26 March 1998, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation ‚Ññ 043/46 amended the criminal case against all of the defendants, except Semenov. According to article 58-10 Part 2 (anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda) of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR, the cases against all defendants were dismissed for lack of evidence. The rest of the sentence was upheld, and the defendants found not subject to rehabilitation.  References  * Stephan, John J.

He holds the Killam Memorial Chair and is Professor of Ecology in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta.AB. Members Profile David W. Schindler. Alberta Order of Excellence He is notable for \\"innovative large-scale experiments\\" on whole lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) which proved that \\"phosphorus controls the eutrophication (excessive algal blooms) in temperate lakes leading to the banning of phosphates in detergents. He is also known for his research on acid rain In 1989, Dr. Schindler moved from the ELA to continue his research at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, with studies into fresh water shortages and the effects of climate disruption on Canada's alpine and northern boreal ecosystems. Schindler's has earned him numerous national and international awards, including the Gerhard Herzberg Gold Medal, the First Stockholm Water Prize (1991) the Volvo Environment Prize (1998), and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement (2006). Early life Schindler was born August 3, 1940 in Fargo, North Dakota and grew up in Minnesota Lake, Minnesota. He holds dual-citizenship in Canada and the U.S. He earned his bachelor's degree at NDSU and PhD at the University of Oxford. Education After completing his bachelor's degree in zoology from North Dakota State University in 1962, Schindler studied aquatic ecology at Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. He worked first under Nikolaas Tinbergen. It was while working under Charles Sutherland Elton, one of the founders of ecology, who also established and led Oxford University's Bureau of Animal Population, that he began formulating an interdisciplinary ecosystem approach to study water and ecology. He received his Ph.D in ecology in 1966 from Oxford University. Early career For two years he was an assistant professor in the Biology Department at Trent University. Career Experimental Lakes Area From 1968 to 1989, Schindler directed the newly created Experimental Lakes Area (ELA),The ELA is now known as the IISD-ELA as it is now managed and operated by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). of the now- defunct Fisheries Research Board of Canada near Kenora, Ontario. IISD-ELA uses the whole ecosystem approach and makes long-term, whole-lake investigations of freshwater focusing on eutrophication. Schindler was awarded the Stockholm Water Prize in 1991 for this research into excess nutrification and acidification of freshwater lakes, a long-term study that used whole lakes as natural laboratories, using an integrated ecosystem approach. His work with ELA was described in a letter by Stanford University biological sciences professor Peter Vitousek supporting Schindler's receipt of the Tyler Award for Environmental Achievement award in 2006, Vitousek wrote that the \\"fertilization of entire lakes\\" the Experimental Lakes area \\"provided incorruptible findings\\" that proved that \\"phosphorus controls the eutrophication of temperate lakes.\\" According to an April 28, 2006 University of Alberta article written about Schindler's receipt of the Tyler award, \\"In a series of landmark experiments conducted during the 1970s and 1980s, Schindler demonstrated that acid rain could begin destroying freshwater lakes at far lower levels than previously thought, and that phosphorus was the major cause of uncontrolled algae growth.\\" Schindler's views on the oil sands tailings ponds In a June 3, 2019 opinion piece in The Globe and Mail, Schindler cautioned against authorizing the \\"discharge of treated effluence\\" from oil sands tailings ponds into the Athabasca River with new regulations at both the provincial and federal level. Freshwater management policies Schindler's large body of scientific work has influenced freshwater management policies including the regulation of toxins and the limitation of eutrophication and acid rain in Canada, the US, and Europe. Selected publications In his 2008 book co-authored with John R. Vallentyne entitled The Algal Bowl: Overfertilization of the World's Freshwaters and Estuaries, Schindler warned about algal blooms and dead zones, \\"The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s haven't gone away; they've moved west into an arid world in which people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of what little freshwater there is to be had here....This isn't just a prairie problem. Global expansion of dead zones caused by algal blooms is rising rapidly...\\" In 2010 he co-authored a report on contaminants in fresh water systems in the area affected by the oil sands development entitled \\"Oil sands development contributes elements toxic at low concentrations to the Athabasca River and its tributaries.\\" Public talks and presentations Schindler has made numerous appearances in film and television programs speaking on issues of water and air quality, particularly regarding the environmental impact of Alberta's oil sands. In 2011 he was featured in the documentary film Peace Out.  Selected awards and honours  Over his career Schindler received over a hundred awards and honours. In 1991 Schindler was awarded the prestigious Stockholm Water Prize for research into excess nutrification and acidification of freshwater lakes. In awarding the prize, the committee noted that \\"A famous photograph of a Canadian lake drew attention to the effects of phosphorus and played an important part in generating public support for tackling the growing problem of eutrophication, an over-abundance of nutrients in aquatic systems and one of the most serious environmental threats facing freshwater bodies and semi-enclosed seas like the Baltic. That photograph has since been reproduced hundreds of times, for students, scientists and the general public.\\" In 2006 Schindler received the Tyler Award for Environmental Achievement joining \\"luminaries as primatologist Jane Goodall; Sir Richard Doll, who established the link between lung cancer and cigarette smoking; and Nobel laureates Paul Critzen and Mario Molina.\\" In 2008 he was honoured with the Alberta Order of Excellence as professor and mentor and \\"an internationally celebrated scientist who has led efforts to protect fresh water resources in Canada and around the world. His groundbreaking research has served as a clarion call alerting authorities and the public to the effects of pollutants and climate change on the environment. \\" He was awarded the Rachel Carson Award for his \\"lifetime of work on whole- ecosystem research in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) at the November 2016 world conference SETAC held in Orlando Florida.

Born Edward F. Freeman in London, England, the jazz guitarist and flamenco enthusiast spent time pursuing his music career in England, Spain, and the United States, eventually moving to Dallas, Texas, where he lived with his family until his death in 1987. His experience playing the tenor banjo led him to create the \\"Eddie Freeman Special 4-String Guitar\\" for the Selmer Music Company, and towards the end of his career, he made accurate transcriptions of the music of famous flamenco guitarists, taught flamenco guitar,.and designed and constructed his own flamenco and classical guitars. Biography Eddie learned to play violin at the age of 12 and became a professional violinist in pit orchestras of silent movie houses in England. While playing in movie houses he took up the tenor banjo. To better master that instrument, he travelled to the United States, where he played with Ricardo Giannoni in New York; with a dance orchestra in Baltimore at the Summit Roadhouse near the Pimlico Racetrack; in a Harlem speakeasy; and in engagements with Billy Lustig and the Scranton Sirens. During this period he found it necessary to abandon the tenor banjo in favour of the six string guitar which was coming into favour. While convalescing from an illness in Baltimore, he developed a method for adapting the tenor banjo techniques to the guitar, which later led to his development of a four-string tenor guitar, the Eddie Freeman Special, using his new method.Freeman, Eddie. March 1933. \\"Something New for Guitarists,\\" Melody Maker He returned to London to play in the Harry Roy Orchestra at the London Pavilion. When noted bandleader Al Collins, heard of Freeman and listened to him play, Collins signed him up for his orchestra at the Savoy Hotel in London. When Collins switched to the Berkeley Hotel in 1932, Freeman went with him. In the early 1930s, Freeman designed the \\"Eddie Freeman Special 4-String Guitar\\" for Selmer Music Company, to implement the guitar method he had developed in Baltimore. One of the Selmer-Maccaferri guitars, the Eddie Freeman Special had the scale- length and body-size of a standard guitar, and used a reentrant CGDA tuning, that had a better sound for rhythm guitar than the normal tenor guitar with its very high A. Since it was still tuned CGDA, it could be played by tenor banjoists. Selmer-Maccaferri tenor guitars were produced from 1932 until 1934. Nearly 100 of the some 300 genuine Maccaferri guitars that were built were Eddie Freeman Specials. The guitar was not a commercial success, despite heavy promotion by Maccaferri, because of opposition from orchestra guitarists in England who thought it was a threat to their livelihoods. Evans, Tom and Mary Anne. Guitars: Basic History, Construction and Players. London: Paddington Press Ltd., p. 232, However, in recent years some luthiers such as the late David Hodson in the UK have started building this four string model again because of demand from their customers. Freeman spent the war years in Belfast playing trumpet and conducting a seven-piece Dixie combo in The Embassy Club. After the war he played trumpet in the Knightsbridge South American Club in London, and doubled with jazz guitar in the Bag O'Nails Club. Freeman moved to the Bronx in New York in the mid-1940s and was joined by his wife and two children in 1946. By the early 1950s they had moved to Oceanside, California where he supported himself as a piano tuner. Inspired by flamenco music, which he first heard at the Savoy Hotel, he left his family in California and travelled to Spain to discover its fundamentals. His search was interrupted when he played violin in the Palma de Majorca Symphony, but in Palma he met guitarist Manolo Baron from whom he learned the basics of flamenco. He later formed a flamenco group, Los Tres de Sevilla, with two dancers. Eddie Freeman with manuscript of a transcription (Photograph by Raiberto Comini)When he returned to the US he moved his family to Dallas, Texas, where wrote, performed, transcribed and perfected his knowledge of flamenco. He made accurate transcriptions of the finest flamenco guitarists: Ramon Montoya, Sabicas, Mario Escudero, Carlos Ramos, Esteban de Sanlucar, Nino Ricardo, and Paco de Lucia. His earliest publication of a flamenco transcription was of a soleares by Esteban de Sanlucar in Issue number 19 of The Guitar Review in 1956, the same year in which he registered his first US copyrights for his transcriptions. He subsequently published a collection of transcriptions of guitar solos (Guajiras, Petenera, and Malaguena) by Carlos Ramos (1967) through Charles H. Hansen Company. Freeman developed a system for teaching Flamenco guitar that differed dramatically from the traditional method in which the student learns by watching the teacher's fingerboard and copying what he is doing. Instead, Freeman insisted that his students learn to read standard music notation, and devised a very simple approach for teaching reading and basic music theory starting with the first lesson in a carefully graded sequence of familiar classical pieces and the Flamenco solos that he had transcribed. Each piece in the library of music that formed the basis of his system was carefully selected to develop a particular aspect of technique or understanding of Flamenco in a logical progression. In addition to transcribing and teaching flamenco guitar, Freeman designed and constructed his own flamenco and classical guitars. The entire January 1980 edition of Jaleo, the newsletter of the Flamenco Association of San Diego, was dedicated to articles about him written by his students and family members.

There are three known opinion polls on the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis. The polls show polarized Honduras. The first CID-Gallup showed support for President Manuel Zelaya's removal from office because of his actions but not the manner in which it was carried out. Subsequent opinion polls showed higher levels of opposition to the events of the coup, though the opinion of the government it inaugurated was more evenly mixed. According to the latest poll in October, only 48% of Hondurans regard Roberto Micheletti's performance as good or excellent, and 50% as bad or poor. Porfirio Lobo Sosa, an opposition member, led polls before the November elections and subsequently won the elections. Before the coup In a 2008 survey, only one in four Hondurans approved Zelaya - the lowest approval rate of 18 regional leaders. On June 22 La Prensa counted that people had organized 18 Facebook groups against Manuel Zelaya. Tens of thousands Hondurans had joined the Internet campaigns against Zelaya. Opinion polls CID-Gallup poll comment CID-Gallup conducted a poll in 16 of the nation's 18 departments between 30 June and 4 July, but the results were reported initially to the press on 9 July and 10 July, leading to confusion. Honduran newspapers, such as El Heraldo, and some news sources outside Honduras, such as the Washington Post, reported that when asked whether they believed the removal of President Zelaya was justified, 41% agreed, 28% disagreed, and 31% said don't know/won't answer. However, the New York Times, the Associated Press, and others reported, possibly based upon an interview of the President of CID-Gallup, that 46% disagreed with Zelaya's ouster, 41% approved of it, with 13% declining to answer. A blogger obtained the original data from CID-Gallup and explained the inconsistency. CID-Gallup asked two different questions: :Q: Do you consider the actions taken by Mel Zelaya with respect to the fourth ballot box to have justified his dismissal from the post of President of the Republic? :¬øConsidera usted que las acciones que tom√≥ Mel Zelaya con respecto a la cuarta urna justificaban su destituci√≥n del puesto de Presidente de la Rep√∫blica? :Yes 41%, No 28%, Don't know/No answer: 31%. :Q: Do you agree with the action taken last Sunday that removed President Zelaya from the country? :¬øCu√°nto est√° usted de acuerdo con la acci√≥n que se tom√≥ el pasado domingo que removi√≥ el Presidente Zelaya del pa√≠s? :Support 41%, Oppose 46%, Don't know/No Answer 13%.

The 2003 St Albans City and District Council election took place on 1 May 2003 to elect members of St Albans District Council in Hertfordshire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrats 23 *Conservative 21 *Labour 13 *Independent 1 Background Following the last election in 2002 the Conservatives were the largest party with 21 seats, compared to 20 for the Liberal Democrats, 15 for Labour, 1 independent and 1 seat was vacant. However the Liberal Democrats gained a seat from the Conservatives at a by-election in Verulam, which meant that going into the 2003 election both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats needed to gain 8 seats to win a majority. Voting trial The election saw a trial of various voting methods. Voters could choose between e-voting, either by computer or on a touchscreen at a polling booth, voting by phone or by post, or on a traditional ballot paper. The period for voting was also increased to allow voting from the 28 April to the 1 May 2003. However problems occurred at 15 polling stations where the system did not recognise voters pin numbers, which meant that traditional paper ballots had to be used in those polling stations. The issues meant the election nearly had to be voided, with the count only able to start over 3 hours after polls had closed. However turnout was up by 5% on the previous election in 2002 at 43%. Election result The Liberal Democrats gained 2 seats from Labour to become the largest party on the council with 23 councillors. The Conservatives remained on 21 seats and there was still 1 independent, while the losses for Labour in Ashley and St Peter's wards reduced them to 13 seats. Following the election the Liberal Democrat group on the council chose Robert Donald as their new leader taking over from Brian Peyton. Ward results By- elections between 2003 and 2004 A by-election was held in Verulam ward on 5 April 2004 after the resignation of Conservative councillor Pauline Buffham, who was moving abroad.

A painter in the Neo-Expressionist style, he has drawn inspiration from Spanish masters such as Vel√°zquez, Goya and Picasso, as well as from Mexican folk art and the American southwest. Committed to his own Regionalist style during his formative years in Texas and New Mexico, he was picked up by Phyllis Kind in 1981. During those years he transitioned to a style characterized by \\"magical realism\\", and his work came to rely on symbol allegory, and unusual shifts in scale. Throughout his career, his paintings and prints have featured flat figures, jagged shadows, and semi-autobiographical content. His oil paintings layer paint, often incorporate collage, and usually contain either figures or horses juxtaposed in strange tableaux.http://www.lesyeuxdumonde.com/artists/Warren/info.html  Formative years 1969‚Äì1973  Born in 1951 in Washington, D.C., Russ Warren began his studies under Earl Staley at the University of St. Thomas in Houston from 1969 to 1971 and finished his B.F.A. at the University of New Mexico in 1973. His earliest paintings reveal a dedicated study of the early Modernists, such as C√©zanne, Kirchner, Matisse, and, especially, Picasso. Still Life with Hands (1971) displays an impressive mastery of these influences. The cutouts of the artist's own hands, placed centrally within and over newspaper clippings of the day points to an autobiographical component that will resurface periodically in his work. In 1981, Eva Hesse noticed this in her review of his first solo show in New York, calling the works \\"private autobiographical paintings that create a mystique of the self.\\"\\"Russ Warren, Xray Visions\\" Elizabeth Hess, Village Voice, June 3‚Äì9, 1981  Regionalism 1973‚Äì1979  After graduating from the University of New Mexico in 1973, Warren moved into his own studio in Houston (1973-5) and worked again with his mentor at St. Thomas, Earl Staley, on an installation from the Beaumont Art Museum in which he created huge papier-m√¢ch√© sculptures of Texas Longhorn, oilmen, businessmen, oversized Stuckey's ash trays in the shape of the state, and other Pop-like images. In graduate school at the University of Texas, San Antonio (1975‚Äì77), he participated in a program designed as an equivalent to a Ph.D. for artists. He received his M.F.A. in 1977, after completing an in- depth thesis on Regionalism, beginning with the WPA works of the late 1920s and ‚Äò30s, and continuing through the Chicago, California and Texas art movements of the ‚Äò70s. His belief that an artist did not need to become \\"mainstream\\" to \\"make it\\" in New York seemed to be upheld when on separate occasions both Marcia Tucker, then director of the New Museum, and Tom Armstrong, then director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, gave him \\"Best in Show\\" awards. Their recognition led to his participation in the Whitney Biennial of 1981, gallery representation with Phyllis Kind, and inclusion in the 1984 Venice Biennale, among other important exhibitions.  Funky Figurative 1979‚Äì1990  After moving from his native Texas to Florida and then to Davidson, North Carolina, Warren's Regionalism gave way to what he has dubbed \\"Funky Figurative,\\" and others have called \\"mad cap surrealist\\" (Donald Kuspit),Painting in the South, 1540 - 1980, by Donald Kuspit, Virginia Museum, Richmond VA, 1983 False Image, False Naivet√©, New Image, New Wave, and Neo Expressionist art. His repeated trips to Mexico and Spain during these years heightened his interest in folk art and the Spanish masters Vel√°zquez, Goya, and Picasso. His animals and figures, now stripped of all particulars, act and interact as in a strange \\"Magic Theatre\\" (Barry Schwabsky),\\"Russ Warren's Magic Theatre, \\" Barry Schwabsky, Arts Magazine, April 1985 taking part in what seem to be epic passion plays, often hovering in catastrophic spaces produced by his exaggerated use of shadow and perspective.  Paso Finos & Picasso 1990‚Äì2000  In 1990, while developing an art class on Picasso at Davidson College, Warren become obsessed with Paso Fino horses, and they began to populate his paintings. One of his most ambitious and successful series, Mare: A Work in Progress, consists of twenty oil paintings, each measuring 4‚Äô x 7‚Äô or 4‚Äô x 8‚Äô. The huge pregnant mare in these works and the house or temple in works leading up to them become the vessel or metaphor for painting itself. Timeless themes of creation and destruction, light and dark, life and death, exist side by side with tongue-in-cheek references to high and low art, as in Elvis Ain‚Äôt No Cubist.  Psychoanalytical Portraits 2001‚Äì2007  In 2001, Warren returned to basics and to his sketchbooks for a series he refers to as \\"Psychoanalytical Portraits\\". The earliest paintings‚Äîoil on panel, mostly in black and white, measuring 20\\" x 16\\"‚Äîare emblems of personal and/or universal angst, recalling the isolation and pain of Munch's Scream and our post-9/11 world. These \\"portraits\\" morph into concise analyses of human attitudes and conditions, from isolation and anxiety to union and joy and back again.  From Magic Mountain 2008 ‚Äì present  When Warren retired from teaching at Davidson College and moved to Charlottesville, VA in 2008, he made a radical departure from the modest in size, jarring in impact, black and white \\"psychoanalytical portraits\\" of previous years, paintings that Picasso scholar Lydia Gasman referred to as \\"brilliant distillations of Picasso,\\" to return to riotous color and large scale. His most recent paintings the artist dubs \\"humorous nightmares,\\" and they do recall some of his earlier work that Donald Kuspit referred to as \\"madcap surrealist\\" in style. For these works he draws freely from his own styles and subjects throughout his 40-year career as well as from some of his favorite artists such as Picasso and Juan Gris. For example, he has painted his own personal version of Picasso's Three Musicians, as well as large still life paintings that reference Juan Gris, in addition to paintings which are reminiscent of some of his earlier work which allude to the magic mountains or magot√© (in Zapatec) he encountered while on a sabbatical in Oaxaca, Mexico. The mountains that recur in these paintings, whether as the main subject, a vista through a window, or painting within a painting in a still life, also undoubtedly mirror some of the mountains and views around Charlottesville.  Livestock Marker Paintings and Sculpture. 2014 - 2015 After receiving a gift of livestock markers in bright shiny colors from a student, Warren was captivated by the fat crayons that are used to mark cattle and how many varied colors it came in. He started experimenting with using them on paper, and continued for several years making paintings of what he dubs \\"Combines\\", faces with multiple profiles and frotal views in one, humorous animals, wildflowers, and most emphatically, a series of over 100 bulls. He also returned to sculpture after seeing the momentous exhibition at MOMA of Picasso's Sculpture, creating a series of animals and figures in painted plaster and found objects.

The Men's Gymnasium was home court for the North Texas Mean Green men's basketball team since the arena opened in 1950 until moving to the Super Pit in 1973. \\"The Snake Pit\\" The intimate 5,000-seat arena, with its low-hanging ceiling and bleachers right up against the playing surface, was known throughout college basketball as one of the toughest places for opposing teams to visit throughout the 1950s and 1960s, especially during Missouri Valley Conference games. The first row of seats were located just two feet from the out-of-bounds and baselines, leaving very little room between fans and the action. While formally known as the Men's Gymnasium for most of its time as the home of the Mean Green, former Drake University head coach Maury John, fed up with the raucous crowd noise following a loss at the Bahnsen Gym, inadvertently gave the facility its nickname in the postgame press conference: ‚ÄúThis is the worst damn place in the world to play basketball. It's like trying to play in a snake pit.‚Äù The name stuck, and when the new 10,000-seat arena opened across the street in 1973, university officials gave the larger venue the Super Pit name in honor of the Snake Pit.

PowerDVD Ultra 9 also supports Dolby Headphone when certain options are set in the \\"Settings\\" menu but PowerDVD is not marketed as an official product of Dolby Headphone. Several Nokia smartphones such as the Nokia N9 officially support Dolby Headphone, and the technology is also supported in the new version of the Nokia Belle Feature Pack 1. The functionality is either pre-installed or is available as an update for the Nokia 603, 700, 701 and 808 Pureview, and is included on many models in the Lumia series including the 810, 820, 920 and 1020. The technology has since been replaced by \\"Dolby Atmos For Headphones\\", which mainly adds the extra simulation required for the Atmos surround channels to the pre-existing technology. This converts the technology into full Binaural surround. Many argue that Dolby Headphone is superior for virtual 5.1 audio.  History  The headphone virtual surround sound technology was initially developed and marketed by Lake Technology in 1997. In October 1998, Dolby licensed the headphone surround sound technology from Lake and renamed it 'Dolby Headphone'. On 23rd Dec 2003, Dolby Laboratories bought over Lake Technology, including the Dolby Headphone technology, for A$21.6 million. Technology Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are used to generate positional audio cues in the two-channel output signal. A finite impulse response (FIR) filter is used to process the audio with lower latency.

Often, these spirit husbands/wives are seen as the primary helping spirits of the shaman, who assist them in their work, and help them gain power in the world of spirit. The relationships shamans have with their spirit spouses may be expressed in romantic, sexual, or purely symbolic ways, and may include gender transformation as a part of correctly pairing with their \\"spouse\\". Shamans report engaging with their spirit spouses through dreams, trance, and other ritual elements.Orlando O. Esp√≠n & James B. Nickoloff: An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies. Liturgical Press, 2007. p. 1315b In some cultures, gaining a spirit spouse is a necessary and expected part of initiation into becoming a shaman. Examples of spirit spouses may be seen in non-shamanic cultures as well, including dreams about Jesus Christ by nuns,instance (Russian Orthodox) - Steven Fanning: Mystics of the Christian Tradition.

Brill, 1996. p. 222 These spirit spouses are said to be in opposition to every man or woman's terrestrial husband or wife. The term that a man's wife would use to describe her relationship to his spirit spouse would translate into other languages as rival. The spirit spouses of the Baule can appear to their wife or husband in dreams and can take many forms but are never the form of their terrestrial spouse. Figurines representing them can be made for particular reasons, for example infertility or another crisis of a sexual nature .\\"Blolo bian in context\\" The blolo is able to give \\"good luck\\" however if the spirit spouse does not help with the problems of the natural world then the character of the spirit may be called into question and the figure of them may be discarded. Susan Vogel: Baule. Among the varied tribes of southern Nigeria such as the Yoruba and the Igbo, Spirit Spouses of the Sea are common features of life due to the geographical closeness of their cultures to the Atlantic Ocean, though attitudes to their supposed existence depend largely on the religious inclinations of the individuals concerned. For example, a Yoruba traditionalist might look at a conjugal visit from a dream-based lover in much the same way as the aforementioned Ewe and Baule do, whereas a Muslim or Christian tribesman in the same situation would most likely look at it as a grave misfortune and seek the mystic aid of a spiritual counsellor to rectify what he would see as a probably dangerous connection to an otherworldly demon.

Europe In Christian literature, there are demons called incubus and succubus, who are also called types of spirit spouses. They are specifically referred to as spirit husband and spirit wife, respectively. In the work of St. Augustine it was stated that \\"many have verified it by their own experience and trustworthy persons have corroborated the experiences others told, that sylvans and fauns, commonly called incubi, have often wicked assaults upon women.\\" These creatures are considered as spirit spouses, who only exist in dreams having intercourse with the dreamer. Some sources state that they are acquired through sexual promiscuity and are prominently connected with witchcraft spells, love potions, and lust.

He supports this with the thesis that the questing/rescuing heroes in myths, legends, and fairy tales can be seen as the soul, and rescued maidens as the fetch bride. However, he does not make it clear if this occurs in dreams, shamanic journeys in a trance state, or both‚Äîthough trance work is an important part of his theology and recommended practice. Some other Neopagan authors from very different traditions have also hinted at the possibility spiritual-sexual union of some sort with divine or spirit being.

The latter practice (of opposite-gender spirit-possession mediumship) is attested in, e.g., Okinawa, Siam, and Burma, in each of which areas it would appear to be mainly (if not entirely) based on non-remembered (putatively non-conscious) trance. The practice of dream-based spirit-marriage would appear likewise to exclude and be excluded by shallower trances involving some partial degree of control (but permanently and continuously, instead of merely intermittently as was the case in non-remembered trance) of the practitioner by a spirit-entity of opposite gender from that of the practitioner; which is attested not only among the berdache in tribes of the Great Plains of North America, but also among the manang in Borneo, and perhaps also among numerous other persons and geographic regions (including European practitioners of homosexual magic, etc.).

It is found in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean from Senegal north to the British Isles. This species is known as the red bandfish, though this name is also given to other members of the genus Cepola.  Distribution  It is found on the coast and inner continental shelf of the eastern Atlantic between northern Senegal and Scotland and the Mediterranean west of the Aegean Sea and the Nile Delta. It can be found on sandy and muddy ocean bottoms at depths of between .  Description  Cepola macrophthalma has a thin, ribbon-like body, which tapers to a pointed tail. It is red in color, with an orange or yellow underside. It has large, silvery eyes. Its dorsal and anal fins stretch the length of its body and are nearly continuous with its tail (caudal fin). It has a large mouth, at an oblique angle, with thin, glassy, widely spaced teeth. These fish are highly variable in length, but an average length is 40.0 cm total length (15.7 in). The maximum length recorded for this species is 80.0 cm total length (31.5 in). Taxonomic distinguishing features include 67‚Äì70 dorsal fin soft rays, 60 anal fin soft rays, two unsegmented dorsal fin rays, and a caudal fin with long median rays free at the tips.  Ecology and behavior  Little was known of the behavior of this species until a population was discovered off the coast of the island of Lundy off the coast of Devon. Since then, many studies have been conducted on the population there, and on captive fish from Lundy. The population at Lundy once comprised around 14,000 individuals, but numbers have dropped severely, despite a ban on fishing in Lundy's waters. These fish are burrowers, and they feed largely like garden eels, sticking their bodies out of their burrows to catch zooplankton. Unlike garden eels, they are not fixed in their burrows, but can move about both inside their burrows and in the open. Their burrows have funnel-shaped openings, due to the large quantities of sediments they displace to construct their burrows, and they consist largely of single elliptical vertical shafts with a chamber at the bottom. The burrows reach depths of up to , and is considered to be typical. Bandfish excavate and maintain their burrows at dawn or dusk, with their mouth, and by pushing mud about with their body. They displace about three litres (three quarters of a gallon) of mud and sand in the excavation of a single burrow, and they take around six hours to construct their burrows. Their burrows often connect with those of the crab Goneplax rhomboides and other burrowing fish and crustaceans, and these associations may be deliberate. Bandfish are an important part of the diets of many oceanic predators, especially John Dories, but also other fish, common dolphins and the musky octopus, Eledone moschata. Bandfish may have taken up an ecological niche burrowing and eating zooplakton due to strong pressures from predators. As food Historically, this species was an important food fish. The earliest recorded recipe, by the Greek cook Mithaecus, was for this species. Andrew Dalby translated it as follows: > Tainia: gut, discard the head, rinse, slice; add cheese and oil. Tainia was the name by which the ancient Greeks called Cepola macrophthalma, and the oil was olive oil. In modern times the species is of a lesser importance. In some countries (such as Italy and Spain) it is still consumed, but in others (such as Greece) it is generally discarded when caught by fishermen trying to catch more desirable species. The fish is prized by British deep-sea anglers, and poaching by anglers is a major threat to the population at Lundy.

In the battle, the Parliamentarians led by Lord Fairfax attacked and captured the strategic Royalist garrison of Selby under the command of John Belasyse. Background In January 1644, Belasyse, the Governor of York, was the commander of Royalist forces in Yorkshire. Belasyse‚Äôs responsibilities included providing for the transport of men and materials in Yorkshire and protecting against incursions by the Parliamentarians. During the winter of 1644, the Parliamentarians conducted numerous raids into Yorkshire, raiding as far north as Whitby in East Riding and Bradford in West Riding. In response to the Parliamentarian raids, Belasyse relocated his headquarters from York to Selby in an attempt to better guard the southern approach to York. In March, Belasyse‚Äôs forces were temporarily reinforced with Royalist cavalry from Newark commanded by Major- General George Porter. On 25 March, Belasyse and Porter went on the offensive and attacked the Parliamentarian garrison at Bradford. The attack ended in failure when Porter‚Äôs cavalry was routed in battle. Both Belasyse and Porter returned to their respective garrisons after the battle. Sensing an opportunity to catch the Royalists at a weak point, the Parliamentarians assembled an army and planned an assault on Selby as the first step of a push toward York. Lord Fairfax brought a contingent from Hull joining with his son, Sir Thomas Fairfax, who came from Cheshire with his cavalry and a number of Lancashire infantrymen. In addition, the Fairfaxes were joined by Colonel John Lambert from the garrison at Bradford and Sir John Meldrum from the Midlands Association. Combined altogether, the Parliamentarians fielded a force of approximately 1,500 horse and 1,800 foot. Battle On 11 April 1644, the Parliamentarian army of Lord Fairfax reached Selby. The town of Selby was unfortified, but surrounded by water obstacles including flooded fields and the River Ouse. Because of the water, there were only four roads leading into the town and on each of the roads, the Royalists had erected and manned barricades To attack the town, Lord Fairfax split his forces into three separate units, sending the infantry regiments down three of the roads simultaneously to attack the barriers. After the barriers were overtaken by the infantry, the Parliamentarian plan was to follow with their cavalry. Lord Fairfax commanded a regiment in the attack of Ousegate, Sir John Meldrum led a second regiment in the attack down Gowthorpe Lane, and Colonel Needham led a third regiment down Brayton Lane. Sir Fairfax stood at the ready with the Parliamentarian cavalry. The advance of the Parliamentarians toward the barriers was met by the musket fire of the Royalist defenders. The Parliamentarians continued to advance along all three fronts of a battle that came to have a number of attacks and counter-attacks. After more than an hour, the Royalists began to abandon the barriers and retire back toward the town. The retreat was successful at the outset as the Royalist cavalry protected their infantry and prevented the Parliamentarians from advancing beyond the barriers. At that point, however, Sir Fairfax and the Parliamentarian cavalry joined the fray. Upon entering the field, Sir Fairfax and his cavalry quickly began to dominate the field. The Royalists cavalry attempted to counter-attack but were beaten back and soon took to flight across the river on a bridge of boats. The Royalist commander, Belasyse, continued to fight attempting to rally his men against the Parliamentarians, but ultimately, he was unhorsed and taken prisoner. By that time, the Parliamentarian infantry had advanced into Selby from three directions surrounding the Royalists. With no route of escape and their commander captured, the Royalists capitulated. A few Royalists were able to escape on their mounts, but the remainder of the garrison, approximately 1,600 men, were taken as captives along with a large amount of arms and ammunition. Aftermath The loss of Selby was a disaster for the Royalists in northern England. York was only 20 kilometers north of Selby and was weakly defended with only two Royalist regiments. The Marquess of Newcastle who had been in County Durham defending against the Parliamentarian‚Äôs Scottish allies was forced to return to York to help with its defence. Eleven days after the fall of Selby, the Parliamentarians began the siege of York which eventually led to the disastrous Royalist defeat at the Battle of Marston Moor and the complete loss of northern England.

Biography Working from his youth in grocery stores in Dallas, Jack Evans joined the Army Air Corps in 1944. Upon returning to Dallas in 1947, he began Evans Lakewood Food Mart at the site of a previously closed Safeway store. He joined Cullum Companies, which operated several grocery brands including Tom Thumb stores (now a part of Safeway) in Dallas, in 1966 and eventually became the chairman and CEO of the company in 1986. Evans went to college at Southern Methodist University. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas) in 1940. Norman Brinker, who founded such restaurant chains as Chili's and Steak & Ale, reported Evans loaned him the money to open his third Steak & Ale restaurant in 1968, a key step to the eventual success of Brinker's restaurant empire. Evans was kidnapped in February 1978 at the Tom Thumb Corporate Headquarters, but escaped when the kidnappers went to collect the $100,000 ransom given by one of his sons, Roy Gene Evans. Political career Evans was elected mayor of Dallas in April 1981, collecting 72% of the vote while running against seven other candidates. In a city often suffering from racial and class divisions, Evans strove to be an inclusive mayor. He received criticism for being the first mayor to address a gay and lesbian organization, the Dallas Gay Alliance. The Dallas Morning News reported he told the group \\"I'm one who accepts people for what they are, and I want you to make the most of what you are\\" and that he supported hiring gay police officers and firefighters. After intense criticism from constituents and other city officials (homosexuality was illegal in Texas at the time), he retracted his support for hiring gay officers. While mayor, he also acquired the land and spurred development for the future Dallas Arts District and led the coalition to attract the 1984 Republican National Convention to the city. In 1982 he founded the Dallas Mayor's committee for the employment of people with disabilities. His goal was to make Dallas a model city for the entire world. He added new and improved technology to the Police Department, looked more into urban crimes and reinstated the Police Awards Banquet. Evans also made plans for a Dallas Police Memorial. He was thought of as the \\"Mayor of all People\\" because of his ability to bring consensus and look at all view points. Evans served one term and did not run for re-election in 1983, choosing to return to his previous position with Cullum Companies. Post-mayoral work He continued to work in a civic capacity in Dallas and the surrounding area after completing his mayoral term, serving as the executive director of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) in 1992, as the chairman of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Board, and on the boards of numerous local companies including Texas Utilities and Brinker International. In 1989, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of his alma mater, Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas. Death Evans died at his home in 1997 after a long bout with colon cancer, survived by his wife Imogene Sachse Evans, his three sons, Roy Gene Evans, Craig Evans, and Jack Evans Jr. and their families. He is buried in Sachse, Texas. He was given the Henry Cohn Humanitarian award before he died and people said he had a \\"will for action and was decisive but was never unkind and approached people with warmth, insight, and deep humanity.\\" In 2000, a section of Fairmount Street in downtown Dallas, which runs through the Arts District he helped create, was renamed Jack Evans Street. In March 2003, the new headquarters of the Dallas Police Department was completed. It is named the Jack Evans Police Headquarters in honor of the former mayor.

During the Holocaust in occupied Poland, most inmates, estimated at over 35,000 Jewish men, women and children were deported to Auschwitz death camp aboard Holocaust trains following roundups lasting from June until August 1943. The Ghetto was liquidated during an uprising, a final act of defiance of its Underground Jewish Combat Organization (≈ªOB) made up of youth. Most of the Jewish fighters perished. The Sosnowiec Ghetto formed a single administrative unit with the Bƒôdzin Ghetto, because both cities are a part of the same metropolitan area in the DƒÖbrowa Basin. Prior to deportations, the Jews from the two ghettos shared the \\"Farma\\" vegetable garden allocated to Zionist youth by the Judenrat. History Before the war, there were about 30,000 Jews in Sosnowiec, making up about 20% of the town's population.Charmatz 2003, Google Print, p.28.

In the first months of 1940 the Zentrale der J√ºdischen √Ñltestenr√§te in Oberschlesien (Central Office of the Jewish Councils of Elders in Upper Silesia), headed by Merin, was created in Sosnowiec, representing about 45 communities. For a time, Merin became infamous as the dictator of the Jews of the Zaglebie region, with the power of life and death over local Jews.Charmatz 2003, Google Print, p.22. A labour camp was established for the Jews deported to Sosnowiec from Czechoslovakia to work at the factory of the Shine brothers. Numerous forced labour facilities were established for the locals; making uniforms, underwear, corsets, bags, leather handbags, and military boots.Charmatz 2003, Google Print, pp.28-30. In 1940 some 2,592 German war profiteers arrived in the city. By 1942, their number rose to 10,749 settlers, constituting 10% of the general population. Ever since the ghetto was established, numerous deportation actions were organized by the Germans with the help of the Judenrat and Merin, selecting healthy men for slave labor at the camps.Charmatz 2003, Google Print, p.32. Large transfers of Jews took part in May (1,500) and June 1942 (2,000).Charmatz 2003, Google Print, p.38. Around October 1942 - January 1943 the ghetto was moved to the ≈örodula district.Charmatz 2003, Google Print, p.46. ≈örodula also bordered the site of the Bƒôdzin Ghetto. At this point about 13,000 Jews still lived in Sosnowiec. The creation of the Sosnowiec ghetto ended on 10 March 1943, when it was finally closed off from the outside world. Thousands of Jews were deported from Sosnowiec to Auschwitz in June 1943 during the major deportation action extending to nearby Bƒôdzin. The Ghetto was liquidated two months later in August, whereas almost all remaining Jews were also deported to Auschwitz.Charmatz, Google Print, p.53. A few hundred Jews remained in the ≈örodula ghetto, which was liquidated in January 1944. The uprising Frumka P≈Çotnicka, age 29, led the uprising in the Bƒôdzin Ghetto adjacent to Sosnowiec There had been considerable underground activity among the Jews in Sosnowiec and Bƒôdzin Ghetto nearby, organized by the youth organizations Ha-No'ar ha-Ziyyoni, Gordonia, and Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir. During the final major deportation push in August 1943, the Jewish Combat Organization (, ≈ªOB) in Bƒôdzin and Sosnowiec staged an uprising against the Germans.Abraham J. Edelheit, A World in Turmoil: An Integrated Chronology of the Holocaust and World War II, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1991, , Google Print, p.284. The uprising, which began on 3 August 1943, was led by Cwi (Tzvi) Brandes, Frumka P≈Çotnicka, and the Ko≈ºuch brothers. It was the final act of defiance of the local population with no chance of success. Most of the young Jewish fighters perished (400 killed in action), fighting the overwhelming German forces. The last Holocaust transport to Auschwitz-Birkenau with Jews forced to bury the dead, left Sosnowiec on 15 January 1944. Resistance of the ghetto inhabitants is commemorated by one of the streets in Sosnowiec, bearing the name \\"Street of the Ghetto Heroes\\" (Ul. Bohater√≥w Getta). There is also Ko≈ºuch Brothers square (Plac Braci Ko≈ºuch√≥w) with a ghetto memorial. Holocaust rescue The Catholic convent of Carmelite Nuns led by Mother Teresa Kieroci≈Ñska aided the Jews in the Ghetto and hiding. Kieroci≈Ñska was awarded a medal of the Righteous 46 years after her death. She was declared \\"heroic in virtue\\" by Pope Francis in 2013. The Carmelite Sisters run an orphanage at the monastery. They delivered free bread to Jews in hiding, send food parcels to Auschwitz, and rescued Jewish children by hiding them under false names among the Christian orphans. The convent was frequently inspected by the Gestapo on suspicion of illegal activities. During the Ghetto liquidation, Danuta Szwarcbaum-Bachmajer escaped with her new baby and was rescued by the Chawi≈Ñski couple. Szloma Szpringer (Springer) with his 5-year- old son Wolf was rescued by Pelagia Huczak, another recipient of the Righteous Among the Nations award. Adela Zawadzka with her 3-year-old child and her sister Rozia Zawadzka escaped from the 1943 deportation and were rescued by J√≥zefa Hankus and her sister Rozalia Porƒôbska who got them false papers from the Polish underground; Rozia used her false Kennkarte to get her fianc√© Elek Jakubowicz out of the camp, helped by Johan Brys, a railway man. Rozalia Porƒôbska sheltered them both, and helped many other Jews from Sosnowiec as well. Porƒôbska family and friend, a total of seven individuals, received the Righteous award in 1982. Mosze Kokotek whose wife Brandla was killed by the Germans, escaped from the ghetto with his 9-year-old daughter Felicja and stayed with the Poles on the Aryan side until 1944. They left the city together after Sosnowiec became Judenfrei. Little Felicja was taken in by Leokadia Statnik (Pessel) in Ochojec near Katowice. Mosze left them there and perished, but his daughter grew up in the care of Leokadia, and in 1957 immigrated to Israel. Another child, Zofia Goldman, rescued by Maria Suszczewicz, was claimed back by her father Henryk who survived, and went with him to Australia. Six Jews were sheltered for two years from 1943 until the arrival of the Soviets in 1945 by Maria Sitko and her daughter Wanda Sitko- Gelbhart, including Fela Kac and her aunt Fryda, Heniek Mandelbaum, Jerzy Feder, as well as Felicja and Leon Weintraub. They shared a tiny apartment consisting of one room with a kitchen and a vestibule with the door into the corridor. Fryda with Fela escaped from the Holocaust train. During police searches, the Jews used to descend into two dugouts constructed by the men under the floors, so the Sitko women could pretend that they did not harbor fugitives, which carried the death penalty in those days. Wanda Sitko stole an identity card while visiting the police station, and gave it to Jerzy Feder which allowed him to go outside with her to obtain the necessities of life on the Aryan side of the city. All Jews survived the Holocaust. Thirty years later in 1986 ‚Äì after her mother's death ‚Äì Wanda Sitko-Gelbhart received a letter from the survivors which stated: \\"You and your mother at the risk of your life did things impossible and great, all this disinterestedly, acting only from the heart, which at that time was truly heroic.

The construction of both Roma and her sister ship was due to rising tensions around the world and the navy's fear that only two Littorios, even in company with older pre-First World War battleships, would not be enough to counter the British and French Mediterranean Fleets. As Roma was laid down almost four years after the first two ships of the class, some small improvements were made to the design, including additional freeboard added to the bow. Roma was commissioned into the Regia Marina on 14 June 1942, but a severe fuel shortage in Italy at that time prevented her from being deployed; instead, along with her sister ships and , she was used to bolster the anti-aircraft defenses of various Italian cities. In this role, she was severely damaged twice in June 1943, from bomber raids on La Spezia. After repairs in Genoa through all of July and part of August, Roma was deployed as the flagship of Admiral Carlo Bergamini in a large battle group that eventually comprised the three Littorios, eight cruisers and eight destroyers. The battle group was scheduled to attack the Allied ships approaching Salerno to invade Italy (Operation \\"Avalanche\\") on 9 September 1943, but the news of the 8 September 1943 armistice with the Allies led to the operation being cancelled. The Italian fleet was instead ordered to sail to La Maddalena (Sardinia) and subsequently to Malta to surrender to the Allies. While the force was in the Strait of Bonifacio, Dornier Do 217s of the German Luftwaffe's specialist wing KG 100--armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs--sighted the force. The first attack failed, but the second dealt Italia (ex-Littorio) and Roma much damage. The hit on Roma caused water to flood two boiler rooms and the aft engine room, leaving the ship to limp along with two propellers, reduced power, and arc-induced fires in the stern of the ship. Shortly thereafter, another bomb slammed into the ship and detonated within the forward engine room, causing catastrophic flooding and the explosion of the #2 main turret's magazines, throwing the turret itself into the sea. Sinking by the bow and listing to starboard, Roma capsized and broke in two, carrying 1,393 men--including Bergamini--down with her. Background :For additional information, see The Italian leader Benito Mussolini did not authorize any large naval rearmament until 1933. Once he did, two old battleships of the were sent to be modernized in the same year, and and were laid down in 1934. In May 1935, the Italian Naval Ministry began preparing for a five-year naval building program that would include four battleships, three aircraft carriers, four cruisers, fifty-four submarines, and forty smaller ships. In December 1935, Admiral Domenico Cavagnari proposed to Mussolini that, among other things, two more battleships of the Littorio class be built to attempt to counter a possible Franco-British alliance--if the two countries combined forces, they would easily outnumber the Italian fleet. Mussolini postponed his decision, but later authorized planning for the two ships in January 1937. In December, they were approved and money was allocated for them; they were named Roma and (\\"Empire\\").Knox, p. 20Garzke & Dulin, p. 404 Laid down nearly four years after Vittorio Veneto and Littorio, Roma was able to incorporate a few design improvements. Her bow was noticeably redesigned to give Roma additional freeboard; partway into construction, it was modified on the basis of experience with Vittorio Veneto so that it had had a finer end at the waterline. She was also equipped with thirty-two rather than twenty-four /65 caliber Breda guns.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 418-419, 426, 428Whitley, pp. 171-172 Description CG rendering of Roma Roma was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She was designed with a standard displacement of , a violation of the restriction of the Washington Naval Treaty; at full combat loading, she displaced . The ship was powered by four Belluzo geared steam turbines rated at . Steam was provided by eight oil-fired Yarrow boilers. The engines provided a top speed of and a range of at . Roma had a crew of 1,830 to 1,950.Garzke & Dulin, p. 435Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 289 Roma was fitted with a catapult on her stern and equipped with three IMAM Ro.43 reconnaissance float planes or Reggiane Re.2000 fighters.Bagnasco & de Toro, p. 48 Romas main armament consisted of nine 50-caliber Model 1934 guns in three triple turrets; two turrets were placed forward in a superfiring arrangement and the third was located aft. Her secondary anti-surface armament consisted of twelve /55 Model 1934/35 guns in four triple turrets amidships. These were supplemented by four /40 Model 1891/92 guns in single mounts; these guns were old weapons and were primarily intended to fire star shells. Roma was equipped with an anti- aircraft battery that comprised twelve /50 Model 1938 guns in single mounts, twenty /54 guns in eight twin and four single mounts, and sixteen /65 guns in eight twin mounts.Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 289-290 The ship was protected by a main armored belt that was with a second layer of steel that was thick. The main deck was thick in the central area of the ship and reduced to in less critical areas. The main battery turrets were thick and the lower turret structure was housed in barbettes that were also 350 mm thick. The secondary turrets had 280 mm thick faces and the conning tower had thick sides. Service history Roma being launched, June 9, 1940 Romas keel was laid by the Italian shipbuilder Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico on 18 September 1938, and she was launched on 9 June 1940. After just over two years of fitting-out, the new battleship was commissioned into the Regia Marina on 14 June 1942. She arrived in the major naval base of Taranto on 21 August, and was assigned to the Ninth Naval Division. Although Roma took part in training exercises and was moved to various bases including Taranto, Naples, and La Spezia, in the next year, she did not go on any combat missions as the Italian Navy was desperately short of fuel. In fact, by the end of 1942, the only combat-ready battleships in the navy were the three Littorios because the fuel shortage had caused the four modernized battleships to be removed from service. When combined with a lack of capable vessels to escort the capital ships, the combat potential of the Italian Navy was virtually non-existent. Roma and her two sisters were moved from Taranto to Naples, on 12 November, in response to the Allied invasion of North Africa; while en route, the three battleships were attacked by the British submarine , though no hits were made.Rohwer, p. 212 On 4 December, the United States launched a major air raid on Naples in an attempt to destroy the Italian fleet; one cruiser was destroyed and two others were damaged in the attack, as were four destroyers.Rohwer, p. 217 Two days later, Roma was transferred with Vittorio Veneto and Littorio to La Spezia, where she became the flagship of the Regia Marina. They remained here through the first half of 1943, without going on any operations.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 392, 404Whitley, p. 178 During this time, La Spezia was attacked many times by Allied bomber groups. Attacks on 14 and 19 April 1943, did not hit Roma, but an American raid on 5 June, severely damaged both Vittorio Veneto and Roma. B-17 aircraft carrying armor-piercing bombs damaged the stationary battleships with two bombs each. Roma suffered from two near hits on either side of her bow. The starboard-side bomb hit the ship but passed through the side of the hull before exploding. The ship began taking on water through leaks from frames 221 to 226‚Äîan area covering about ‚Äîand through flooding from the bow to frame 212. The second bomb missed but exploded in the water near the hull. Leaks were discovered over a area ranging from frames 198 and 207. Approximately of water entered the ship.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 392, 403-404 Roma was damaged again by two bombs in another raid on 23-24 June. One hit the ship aft and to starboard of the rear main battery turret and obliterated several staterooms, which were promptly flooded from broken piping. The second landed atop the rear turret itself, but little damage was suffered due to the heavy armor in that location. This attack did not seriously damage Roma or cause any flooding, but she nevertheless sailed to Genoa for repairs. Roma reached the city on 1 July, and returned to La Spezia, on 13 August, once repairs were complete.  Loss  Roma underway Along with many of the principal units of the Italian fleet--including Vittorio Veneto and Italia (the ex-Littorio)--the cruisers , , and , and eight destroyers--Roma sailed from La Spezia with Adone Del Cima as captain and also as the flagship of Admiral Carlo Bergamini on 9 September 1943, a day after the proclamation of the 1943 Italian armistice. The group was later joined by three additional cruisers from Genoa, , , and . On that same day, the fleet had been scheduled to sail towards Salerno in order to attack the Allied ships sailing to invade Italy as part of Operation Avalanche; the proclamation of the armistice on 8 September, however, had led to the cancellation of this operation. As German forces in Italy launched Operation Achse, Admiral Bergamini was ordered to leave La Spezia, in order to prevent the fleet from falling in German hands, and reach Allied-controlled ports. Due to Bergamini's initial reluctance to bring his ships to Malta (not knowing the details of the armistice and what would be the fate of the fleet once in Allied controlled ports) and to initial plans for the transfer of Victor Emmanuel III, his court and the government from Rome to La Maddalena (the destroyers Vivaldi and Da Noli sailed from Genoa and La Spezia, heading for Civitavecchia, for this purpose), the initial destination was La Maddalena, a naval base in Sardinia. Once at La Maddalena, Bergamini would receive further orders (to proceed to Malta) from Admiral Bruno Brivonesi, naval commander of Sardinia, as well as some documents regarding the conditions of the armistice for the Navy. The transfer of the king to La Maddalena was cancelled, however (he instead fled towards Pescara), and when the fleet arrived off La Maddalena, German troops had occupied that base to transfer their troops from Sardinia to Corsica, therefore the stop at La Maddalena was also cancelled and Supermarina ordered Bergamini to head for Allied-controlled B√¥ne. The fleet then changed course, but when Germany learned that the Italian fleet was sailing towards an Allied base, the Luftwaffe sent Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs to attack the ships. These aircraft caught up with the force when it was in the Strait of Bonifacio.Garzke & Dulin, p. 405Fioravanzo, pp. 8‚Äì34Wade, p. 225 A Fritz X radio-controlled bomb The Do 217s trailed the fleet for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon sighting them; they were trailing the fleet at such a distance that it was impossible to identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard propellers to stop for want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.Garzke & Dulin, p. 407 Losing power and speed, Roma began to fall out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the starboard side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines. This caused additional catastrophic flooding in the bow, and the battleship began to go down by the bow while listing more and more to starboard. The ship quickly capsized and broke in two. According to the official inquest conducted after the sinking, the ship had a crew of 1,849 when she sailed; 596 survived with 1,253 men going down with Roma.Bagnasco & De Toro, pp. 273, 344 According to naval historian Francesco Mattesini, who cites the research of Pier Paolo Bergamini, the son of Admiral Bergamini, around two hundred men from Bergamini's staff were aboard Roma, and were mistakenly not included in the official inquiry. These men increased the total number aboard to 2,021 and the total fatalities to 1,393.Mattesini, pp. 529-530 In her 15-month service life, Roma made 20 sorties, mostly in transfers between bases (none were to go into combat), covering and using of fuel oil in 133 hours of sailing.Garzke & Dulin, p. 410 Wreck discovery The sunken vessel was found in June 2012, by the underwater robot 'Pluto Palla', designed by Italian engineer Guido Gay. It was discovered about off the northern coast of Sardinia, at a depth of around . On 10 September 2012, a memorial ceremony was held on an Italian frigate over the spot where Roma went down.

Early life Augustine was born on 1 April 1891, at Ramapuram in Travancore (present-day Kerala, India). He was the son of Mr. Itty Iype and Mrs. Eliswa of the Thevarparambil clan, which was a branch of the Kuzhumpil lineage. Augustine received his primary education at a school sponsored by the government of Travancore. He advanced to St. Ephrem's School in Mannanam where his religious faith intensified, compelling him to pursue a career as a priest. After completing in secondary education at St Ephrem's School, Augustine embarked on a jounery on foot from Ramapuram to Changanacherry in order to enroll in St Thomas Minor Seminary. After receiving his major seminary formation at Puthenpally Seminary in Varapuzha, Augustine was ordained as a priest on July 16, 1915. Early career After celebrating his first mass at St. Augustine Church in Ramapuram, his home parish, Augustine resided in his home village for eight years while undergoing practical training. He was known as Kunjachan ('little priest' in Malayalam) for his short stature. In 1923, Augustine was appointed as assistant vicar to Fr. Thomas Kuzhumpil at St. Sebastian Church in Kadanad. During his vocation in Kadanad, Kunjachan was often approached by the local villagers, who relied on his advice and blessings for their agricultural yield. Kunjachan would sprinkle holy water on crops, ensuring a plentiful harvest. Unfortunately, an illness forced Kunjachan to return to Ramapuram. Missionary work In Ramapuram, Kunjachan witnessed an entire caste of people deprived of dignity, respect, and the basic necessities of life. He would devote his entire life to the uplifting of the downtrodden. It is the singular achievement of Kunjachan that he had been able to baptize by himself no less than 5,000 Dalits (earlier the term 'Harijan' was used). He is to be counted as one of the foremost missionaries among the Dalits in India. In fact, he neither made use of eloquent sermons nor of any human techniques in order to give them the \\"Christ\\" of whom he was the herald. He preached with his works, practising charity, and always sublime and more dedicated. Kunjachan led a very simple life for the poor and wished to be with them even after death. He spent everything he had for the poor. The Blessed who was a priest for more than 50 years, wrote in his Testament: \\"I do not possess anything either as landed property or as cash account... After my death, my funeral must be conducted in the most simple way. Ever since 1926, I had been staying with the Harijan (Dalit) Christians. Even after death, I would like to be with them. Therefore my dead body should be buried where the Harijan Christians are buried\\". Death After a brief period of serious illness Kunjachan died on 16 October 1973 at the age of 82. At his death the children and others told that 'a saint has passed away'. At his funeral the priest who preached the panegyric, spoke well of his holiness in life, apostolic zeal, kindness of heart, love for the poor and other outstanding virtues. And towards the end of the speech he said to the surprise of all, \\"we are participating in the funeral of a saint. We have one more mediator in heaven.\\" Kunjachan had the reputation of a holy man even while he was alive. People irrespective of caste and religion, used to approach him in their manifold needs and they got favors through his prayers and blessings. Within a few days after his death his tomb at Ramapuram became a center of pilgrimage for people from far and wide. Beatification and canonization Beatified by Varkey Vithayathil, Major Archbishop of the Syro- Malabar Church on 30 April 2006.Participated by Papal Nuncio to India Archbishop Pedro Lopez Quintana and Cardinal Telesphore Toppo, President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI). The process of Beatification and Canonization started on 11 August 1987 at Ramapuram, bestowing upon him the title, 'Servant of God'. The 'Positio super vita et virtutibus' was completed after ten years and was submitted at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 12 February 1997. The 'Positio' on the heroic practice of virtues of the saintly priest was approved by Pope John Paul II on 22 June 2004 and he was declared 'The Venerable'. Meanwhile, the process of the miraculous cure of the clubfoot of a boy, Gilson Varghese, was undertaken, and the findings were sent to Rome for consideration. After a thorough investigation of the miraculous nature of the cure, made by competent personnel in Rome, Pope Benedict XVI approved it, opening the way for Beatification. Venerable Kunjachan was beatified by Card. Varkey Vithayathil, Major Arch bishop of the Syro-Malabar Church on 30 April 2006 at the very same village Ramapuram where he was born, worked, died and buried. The Papal Nuncio to India Archbishop Pedro Lopez Quintana, Cardinal Telesphore Toppo, President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI), and other Bishops and priests participated in the ceremony. The Feast of Blessed Kunjachan is celebrated on 16 October every year. Blessed Kunjachan had his last times at family house Thervarparampil Ramapuram. External links * Thevarparampil Kunjachan * Fr.

It was underpowered with an unreliable engine. Re-engined, it flew in many races, with first place in the 1926 Grosvenor Challenge Cup its greatest success. Design and development Amongst the many aircraft designed and built for the Lympne light aircraft competitions of the mid-1920s, the RAE Hurricane and the Cranwell CLA.2 had one other thing in common. Both were product of amateur groups formed within government funded aeronautical establishments, the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and the Cranwell RAF College. The Hurricane was built for speed and flew in the 1923 Lympne Motor Glider Competition, the CLA.2 for durability, flying in the two-seater competition the following year.Flight 9 October 1924 p.650 The Hurricane was a wooden framed, fabric covered shoulder wing monoplane. The wing was a two spar cantilever structure,Flight 11 October 1923 p.625 made possible by the adoption of one of the novel thick G√∂ttingen airfoil sections. It was tapered, but almost entirely on the trailing edge and with clipped wingtips. Seen in plan, the wing of the Hurricane looked much a late 20th-century light aircraft. The competition rules required that aircraft could access suitable fields via a farm gate, and many met this condition with folding wings. The Hurricane's designer, Samuel Childs chose instead to make its wings easily detachable after removing eight bolts per side. The fuselage of the Hurricane was in contrast very much of its time, built up on two upper longerons and a strongly curved keel, producing a structure that was narrow and almost parallel in plan and a thin triangle in cross section, deepest between engine and the wing leading edge, tapering rapidly aft. The single-seat open cockpit was at mid- chord, between the spars. The main undercarriage was a pair of fabric covered motorcycle type wire wheels mounted at the ends of a horizontal leaf spring fixed to the keel and braced to the fuselage with a pair of V-struts, with the result that the Hurricane sat very close to the ground. At the rear the empennage was conventional, with a broad chord fin bearing an unbalanced rudder that extended between split elevators to the keel. Initially the tailplane leading edge was curved and merged into the curved elevator tips. Forward of the wing, the fuselage tapered rapidly, mostly through the upward bend of the keel. Because the 600 cc Douglas flat twin engine used in the 1923 aircraft was geared down 2:1 via a front-mounted chain drive that put the propeller shaft at the top of the motor, it was mounted low and to the rear of the nose, with cylinders exposed for cooling. The output of this engine was only 21.5 hp (16 kW). Several changes were made during 1924. The Douglas engine was replaced with a 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub II flat twin. This more powerful motor was also lighter, lacking the reduction gear of the Douglas and therefore mounted in the extreme nose with propeller and exposed cylinders at wing level. At about the same time the empennage was modified with a squarer tailplane,This may have been done first, as the g/a diagram in Ord-Hume shows the new tailplane with old fin and the Douglas engine taller, less rounded fin and square tipped rudder. The leaf spring undercarriage was replaced with a lighter split axle unit carrying smaller wheels and braced with conspicuous V-struts to the wing roots. There were also modifications to the top of the fuselage, including the installation of a side hinged cockpit cover with an opening just large enough to allow the pilot's head to protrude. Operational history Only one Hurricane was built, registered G-EBHS.CAA certificate for G-EBHS Since the Lympne trials were in October, the Hurricane must have made its first light in the late summer of 1923, probably piloted by Paul Bulman. At the trials, with Bulman at the controls it flew rather tail down, suggesting trim and wing incidence issues had not been sorted.Flight 18 October 1923 p.637 Compared with some other competitors it was overweight; like many others it suffered from an unreliable engine. Worst, it was slow; it had been entered specifically for the Abdullah speed prize and there had been talk of speeds near 100 mph, but the best it could do was 58.5 mph (94 km/h) before retiring with a broken rocker arm.Flight 18 October 1923 p.640 The winner of this ¬£500 prize was the Parnall Pixie II at 76.1 mph.Flight 18 October 1923 p.648 As a single seater, the Hurricane did not qualify for the 1924 Lympne Two Seater Light Plane Competition, but flew in the Grosvenor Challenge Cup immediately afterwards, now powered with the Cherub engine. The extra power produced a speed of about 80 mph, but it failed at just past the half way stage.Flight 9 October 1924 p.659 Its most successful meeting was at Lympne in August 1925, flown by F/Lt J. F. Chick where it won the light Plane Holiday Handicap, the Private Owners Race and, most prestigiously the eight lap, 100 mile (161 km) Grosvenor Challenge Cup,Flight 27 August 1925 p.551 averaging 81.2 mph (131 km/h).Flight 20 August 1925 p.538 In total, the Hurricane picked up ¬£300 in prizes at that meeting. It was flown by Chick in its last Grosvenor Cup in 1926; although it was faster than before (84.8 mph or 136 km/h), it only managed third place.Flight 23 August 1926 p.619 It was broken up later that year.

It was recorded on December 18, 1967 (released on May 13, 1968), and was included on the group's album, Special Occasion. Composed by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, and Motown staff songwriter Al Cleveland and produced by Robinson, the song was a Billboard top 40 pop hit, peaking at No. 31, and a top 10 R&B; hit as well, peaking at No. 9. It also reached No. 24 on the U.S. Cash Box Top 100.Cash Box Top 100 Singles, July 13, 1967 In Canada, the song reached No. 28. A mid-tempo song, instead of the usual ballad, a trademark of The Miracles, this tune is a sad lament about a lost love, the theme of many Miracles' songs. The song's title, \\"Yester Love\\", is a shortened form of \\"Yesterday Love\\", or \\"Love of Yesterday\\", indicating the relationship has now ended. Smokey, as the song's narrator, portrays a heartbroken man, reminiscing about a once-happy relationship with his girl, with promise of a future, that ended in failure, with his wondering just how it got there: :\\"Yesterday, we made future plans.... :She loved me, I could tell... :Can today be that tomorrow... :That we planned so well... :Yester Baby, I'll never forget her... :Though tomorrow might bring me one better... :Today, I go my way, dreaming of my Yester love...\\" During the song, Smokey, ever the master poet, also explains the meaning of his use of the term \\"Yester\\", in his usual fashion: :\\"Yester is..... :The Prefix that we fix :To things that have gone by... :Forever, they say....\\" Miracle Marv Tarplin's outstanding guitar work is evident throughout, and is actually the last thing the listener hears as the song draws to a close. During the song, Miracles Claudette Robinson, cousin Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, and Pete Moore, project sympathetic background vocals to Smokey's lead, with Claudette's voice clearly audible in the chorus. \\"Yester Love\\" was released during 1968, a period during which The Miracles, a normally guaranteed Top 20 and occasional Top 10 group, were undergoing an inexplicable chart decline, along with many of Motown's other top groups, including The Supremes. This trend was soon reversed by the Top 10 success of their hit \\"Baby, Baby Don't Cry\\" in spring 1969. \\"Yester Love\\" has inspired a cover version by Gerald Wilson and his Orchestra, and has been included in several Miracles \\"Greatest Hits\\" anthologies. Taken from the same album, the song's \\"B\\" side, \\"Much Better Off\\", like many Miracles \\"B\\" sides, was also a popular regional hit, and inspired a cover version by late rapper J Dilla.

It is in the care of the Irish State. The Butler dynasty has important links to the area. History Castle tower The main castle building is a fortified tower dating from the sixteenth-century. An adjoining hall was added at a later date, when the need for defence gave way to the large windows associated with settled times. In the sixteenth century the manor of Kilcash passed from the Wall family into the possession of the Butlers of Ormond until the latter sold it to the Irish State in 1997 for ¬£500. In 1614, Walter, 11th Earl of Ormond, who lived at Kilcash, inherited the Ormond title from his uncle Thomas, 10th Earl of Ormond. The possession of the Ormond lands was disputed and Walter spent 1619-1625 in prison in London while James VI and I pressurised him to surrender most of his property. Walter passed the manor of Kilcash on to one of his grandsons, Colonel Richard Butler of Kilcash (d. 1701). The 3rd Earl of Castlehaven, a noted Confederate Catholic commander in the 1641-52 war, frequently stayed at Kilcash where his sister, Lady Frances, was married to Richard of Kilcash, another confederate commander. Lord Castlehaven wrote his memoirs there (published as The Earl of Castlehaven's Review). In the 19th century, the castle fell into ruin after parts of the Kilcash Estate were sold c. 1800. During the Irish Civil War, the castle was occupied by Anti-Treaty forces in an attempt to slow the approach of Pro-Treaty forces towards Clonmel. They were finally dislodged by artillery fire under the command of Commandant-General John T. Prout, further damaging the already dilapidated structure. By the late twentieth century, the castle was in a dangerous state of repair. Beginning in 2011, the castle underwent extensive repairs to prevent it from collapsing. Church Near the castle are the remains of a medieval church consisting of a chancel and a nave with a Romanesque doorway in its south wall. This building was partially repaired in the 1980s and is now safe to visit. In the graveyard, the Butler Mausoleum (a building nearly as large as the church) contains the tombs of: * Thomas Butler of Garryricken; * Christopher Butler, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cashel (1673‚Äì1757), a younger brother of Thomas Butler of Garryricken; * Margaret Magennis, Viscountess Iveagh (1673‚Äì1744), wife of Thomas Butler; * Walter Butler, 16th Earl of Ormonde (died 1773); and * John Butler, 17th Earl of Ormonde (died 1795). Some of the eighteenth-century headstones are carved with elaborate scenes of the crucifixion.http://www.megalithicireland.com/Kilcash%20Church,%20Tipperary.html The lament for Kilcash The castle is best known for the song \\"Kilcash\\" (), which mourns the ruin of the castle and the death of Margaret Magennis, Viscountess Iveagh. The song has been ascribed to Fr John Lane (d. 1776), but the woods lamented in its first stanza were not sold until 1797 and 1801, long after Lane's death. The earliest manuscripts of the poem date from the mid- nineteenth century. Its first stanza reads: The castle from a distance :Cad a dh√©anfaimid feasta gan adhmad? :T√° deireadh na gcoillte ar l√°r; :n√≠l tr√°cht ar Chill Chais n√° ar a teaghlach :is n√≠ chluinfear a cling go br√°th. :An √°it √∫d a gc√≥na√≠odh an deighbhean :fuair gradam is meidhir thar mhn√°ibh, :bh√≠odh iarla√≠ ag tarraingt tar toinn ann :is an t-aifreann binn √° r√°. :Now what will we do for timber, :With the last of the woods laid low? :There's no talk of Cill Chais or its household :And its bell will be struck no more. :That dwelling where lived the good lady :Most honoured and joyous of women :Earls made their way over wave there :And the sweet Mass once was said.

Laarks on MySpace Reception Laarks' release of their album An Exaltation of Laarks, both before and after signing with Absolutely Kosher Records, has been met with high praise. Volume One, a local Eau Claire, Wisconsin publication praised Exaltation's style and technical skill when they wrote: \\"An Exaltation of Laarks showcases not only the complexities of Jacoby and company‚Äôs songwriting, full of winding progressions and mood swings galore, but also an array of drummer Brian Moen‚Äôs intricate engineering skills...Songs start and end in a bath of guitar swells and muddled keyboard bleeps. Drums get run through layers of effects and filters, and vocal lines are harmonized and constantly shifting panels to attack from different perspectives. The 10 tracks fit together because of it, embracing the same artistic concepts and making the album feel more like a finished puzzle than separate pieces\\". An Exaltation of Laarks, Volume One review Absolutely Kosher Records praises Exaltation for its energy and individuality and proudly releases the album whose \\"end result is a record full of melodic hooks embedded in indie rock mini-epics, with raucous crescendos and climaxes of textures pinned between pauses and composed reflection. The band pushes and prods Jacoby‚Äôs astute-yet-innocent pop songs into dynamic, overblown declarations of grandeur with layered keyboards, organs and guitars swirling around pulsing, driving bass and frantic, fiery drums. It‚Äôs the sound of a band markedly assured for a debut, delightfully void of irony, with a maelstrom of reference points resulting in some of the most vigorous, fervent electrifying pop music on any side of the Chippewa River\\".

Trends  Rising Trend In recent years, Singapore has seen a large increase in the number of sporting events taking place in the city state. Numerous marathons, triathlons, fun-runs and other mass participation events have been supported by government agencies and the public alike. The government has taken the initiative to connect paths island wide to ensure seamless riding as well as the introduction of more safety signs on the roads to encourage safe cycling. The Land Transport Authority has also recently announced plans to install more bicycle kiosks around the island and to allow foldable bikes on the MRT trains so that more commuters would consider cycling. In an effort for OCBC to promote safe cycling in Singapore, free cycling jerseys printed with safe cycling messages were also distributed to cyclists before the OCBC Cycle Singapore event. There has also been an increase in the number of cycling clubs in Singapore in recent years. OCBC Cycle Singapore has carved a niche in the market as the first cycling event targeted at the mass market which caters to all levels of participants and is owned and organised by Spectrum Worldwide with OCBC bank as the title sponsor.

With between half a million and a million protesters it was one of the largest demonstrations in East German history and a milestone of the peaceful revolution that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification. The demonstration was organized by actors and employees of theaters in East Berlin. It was the first demonstration in East German history that was organized by private individuals and was permitted to take place by the authorities. The speakers during the demonstration were members of the opposition, representatives of the regime and artists, and included the dissidents Marianne Birthler and Jens Reich, the writer Stefan Heym, the actor Ulrich M√ºhe, the former head of the East German foreign intelligence service Markus Wolf and Politburo member G√ºnter Schabowski. Background and preparations The original pamphlet distributed by the organizers In early October 1989, East German authorities celebrated the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, they had to face increasing protests across the country and a mass exodus of their citizens to West Germany via Hungary and the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw. On 18 October, reformist members of the Politburo forced Erich Honecker to resign as the chair of the council of state and general secretary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED). He was replaced by the slightly less hardline Egon Krenz, who became the new party leader and the chair of the council of state a few days later. In his inaugural address, he used the term Die Wende (lit. turnaround) and promised political reforms. He later ordered the cessation of all police actions against protesters and reopened the previously closed border to Czechoslovakia. A few days later, on 23 October, more than 300,000 people joined the Monday demonstration in Leipzig, and many more at other protests throughout the country. The Alexanderplatz demonstration was the first officially permitted demonstration in East Germany that was organized by individuals and not by the authorities. The first idea for a demonstration on the Alexanderplatz in the center of the capital of East Germany came from actors and employees of theaters in East Berlin, who had been struck by the assaults on peaceful protesters by the Volkspolizei and the Stasi during the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of East Germany on 7 October 1989. On 15 October 1989 at 11 am, an assembly of actors and employees of theaters in East Berlin met at the Deutsches Theater and decided to hold a demonstration for democratization and against the East German government. It was not the first meeting as on 7 October, the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, actors of the Volksb√ºhne had invited their colleagues to discuss the political situation. The application for a permit to hold a demonstration was submitted two days later to the authorities by Wolfgang Holz of the Berliner Ensemble. The application was met with confusion by the SED and Stasi who could not decide whether to ban, allow or subvert the planned demonstration. After long deliberations the authorities decided on 26 October to permit the demonstration. A list of speakers was prepared by the organizers, including representatives of the regime, members of the opposition and artists. After having permitted the demonstration authorities tried to subvert the demonstration by spreading rumors ‚Äì rumors such as that the Friedrichshain hospital is scheduling extra shifts for their doctors, that the German Reichsbahn will transport agent provocateur to Berlin or that the protesters are planning to march toward the Brandenburg Gate at the Berlin Wall. At the same time the organizers hired marshals who would wear a yellow sash with the words \\"No violence!\\". Demonstration Protesters referring to paragraphs 27 and 28 of the East German constitution On 4 November 1989 the demonstration started at 9:30 with a protest march to the Alexanderplatz in the center of East Berlin. At 11:00 the first protesters arrived at the Alexanderplatz. The more than 500,000 protesters came not only from East Berlin but from all over East Germany. Thousands of banners showed the slogans that were already used by hundred of thousands of protesters in other East German cities during the still illegal Monday demonstrations. Neither the opening of the Berlin wall nor a possible German reunification were among the demands. Instead the protesters concentrated on the democratization of East Germany, with references to paragraphs 27 and 28 of the East German constitution which in theory but not in practice guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Stage actors Ulrich M√ºhe and Johanna Schall during the demonstration The opening speeches were given by Marion van de Kamp, Johanna Schall, Ulrich M√ºhe and Jan Josef Liefers, who were stage actors from East Berlin. Ulrich M√ºhe, actor at the Deutsches Theater demanded in his speech the abolition of the first paragraph of the East German constitution which guaranteed the leading role of the Socialist Unity Party. In the next three hours, a series of speakers voiced their demands for democratic reforms in East Germany. The three-hour-long demonstration was televised live on East German television, including the scenes of representatives of the regime being jeered and booed by the protesters. Later, the dissident B√§rbel Bohley would say about Markus Wolf, former head of the East German foreign intelligence service and speaker during the demonstration: The speakers were, in order of appearance: lawyer Gregor Gysi, Marianne Birthler of the opposition group Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, Markus Wolf, Jens Reich of the opposition group New Forum, LDPD politician Manfred Gerlach, actor Ekkehard Schall, SED Politburo member G√ºnter Schabowski, writer Stefan Heym, theologian and dissident Friedrich Schorlemmer, writer Christa Wolf, actor Tobias Langhoff, film director Joachim Tschirner, dramatist Heiner M√ºller, university rector Lothar Bisky, university student Ronald Freytag, writer Christoph Hein, Hungarian student Robert Juhoras, and actress Steffie Spira. Banners The most often and commonly used protest slogan of the Monday demonstrations as well as the Alexanderplatz demonstration was \\"We are the people\\" () which became \\"We are one people\\" () after the fall of the Berlin Wall, thus changing the nature of the demonstrations. Many other slogans and banners have been documented by photographs and by an exhibition in the Deutsches Historisches Museum: * \\"Change without ifs and buts\\" (\\"Wende ohne wenn und aber\\") * \\"Civil rights not only on paper\\" (\\"B√ºrgerrechte nicht nur auf Papier\\") * \\"Rehabilitate Robert Havemann\\" (\\"Rehabilitiert Robert Havemann\\") * \\"Privileges for all\\" (\\"Privilegien f√ºr alle\\") * \\"Socialism yes, Egon no\\" (\\"Sozialismus ja, Egon nein\\") * \\"No lies ‚Äì new people\\" (\\"Keine L√ºgen ‚Äì neue Leute\\") * \\"New thinking in old heads?\\" (\\"Neues Denken in alten K√∂pfen?\\") * \\"Democracy for the SED\\" (\\"Demokratie f√ºr die SED\\") * \\"No Nazi-methods in the penal system\\" (\\"Keine Nazimethoden im Strafvollzug\\") * \\"Open door day in Wandlitz\\" (\\"Tag der offenen T√ºr in Wandlitz\\") * \\"Independent labor union!\\" (\\"Unabh√§ngige Gewerkschaft!\\") * \\"40 years are enough\\" (\\"40 Jahre sind genug\\") Commemorations In early 1990 banners of the demonstration were used to decorate and cover the exhibits of the by then politically outdated permanent exhibition \\"Socialist mother country GDR\\" at the Deutsches Historisches Museum. In mid-1994 banners and other artifacts of the demonstration were permanently added to the collection of the museum and were shown in an exhibition on the Alexanderplatz demonstration. The banners were preserved by Henning Schaller, stage designer at the Maxim-Gorki-Theater, who asked participants to leave the banners so that they could be collected for an art exhibition. To mark the tenth anniversary in 1999 a series of events under the title \\"We were the people\\" () were held in Berlin. Notes :A: The number of participants differs across sources. Initially media reported numbers of around 500,000, as for example did The New York Times or numbers of one million as for example did Die Zeit. Later the organizers claimed one million participants, estimated from aerial photographs. Other sources such as the historian Karsten Timmer mention only half a million protesters. Irrespective of the exact number of protesters most sources agree that this was the largest demonstration in the history of East Germany, with some sources even claiming that it was the largest demonstration in German history. A contrary viewpoint is held by the historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk, who estimates that at most 200,000 protesters participated. His estimate is based on four person per square meter and the fact that the Alexanderplatz has an area of 50,000m^2, the limited capacity of public transport in East Berlin and the incentives of the organizers, the media and other groups to exaggerate the number of participants to increase the pressure on the ruling party. :B: The pamphlet reads: \\"Information by the association of theater workers.

She specialises in covering Central Asia, the Middle East and terrorism and has investigated many of the major human rights issues and global political and military events over the past three decades. Early life and career Jane Corbin was educated at King's College London, graduating with a degree in English in 1975. She was part of the first intake of new journalists to be employed by Channel 4 News before its launch in November 1982. While with ITN Corbin covered major news events such as the siege of the Holy Sikh Temple at Amritsar in June 1984 and interviewed Indira Gandhi just before she was killed by her own Sikh bodyguard. Jane reported on the miners' strike in the same year. and accompanied Benazir Bhutto back to Pakistan in 1982. Since joining the BBC's flagship current affairs programme Panorama in 1988, Corbin has made over a hundred documentaries working as a reporter in war zones and as an investigative journalist in general for the BBC.

Corbin has reported extensively from the Middle East covering the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, including her inside account of the negotiations that led to the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993. She has reported extensively from the West Bank and Gaza covering the conflict - for example in the films 'The War of the Tunnels' in Gaza in 2014 and 'Price Tag Wars on the activities of right-wing teenagers in Israel whom their own government calls 'terrorists'. Corbin reported from Iraq during the first Gulf War in 1991/2 when she revealed the existence of Saddam Hussein's secret nuclear weapons programme and his Supergun. Since 2000 During the second Iraq war of 2003, Corbin gained exclusive access to the United Nations weapons inspectors as they searched for the alleged Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq, which have never been found. After filming the British forces' invasion and taking of Basra she was again given access to the coalition Iraq Survey Group as they searched fruitlessly for the WMDs that had been used to justify the war. Jane Corbin has reported extensively from Afghanistan and from Pakistan making programmes about the Taliban, women's rights and the war against militants on both sides of the border. She covered the hunt for Bin Laden in Afghanistan and Pakistan and made a one-hour documentary for BBC1, Hostage, on Al-Qaeda's tactic of hostage-taking in Iraq.

On 24 October 2014, the Rwandan government suppressed the BBC's broadcasts in Kinyarwanda, one of the country's main languages, in Rwanda.Dugald Baird \\"Rwanda bans BBC broadcasts over genocide documentary\\", 24 October 2014\\"Rwanda suspends BBC broadcasts over genocide film\\", BBC News, 24 October 2014 In 2015 in 'Iraq: The Final Judgement\\" at the time of the Chilcot Report into the causes and impact of the Iraq War, Corbin re-visited the places and people - from Basra to Baghdad - she had filmed over a decade of reporting on the coalition's war. In 2016 in a BBC film \\"Kill the Christians\\" she charted the destruction of Christian communities by ISIS, the Islamic State across the Middle East from Iraq to Syria and their exodus to Iraqi Kurdistan and the Lebanon. Jane has investigated the rise of the Islamic State and the western vulnerabilities it has identified - for example in her film 'Terror on the Beach\\" on the attack by a 'lone wolf' on tourists in Tunisia. In 2017 Corbin presented a documentary on the Balfour Declaration, signed a hundred years before, which led to the creation of a homeland for the Jewish people, the creation of the state of Israel and the bitter conflict that has continued to this day between Israel and the Palestinians over the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and the status of Jerusalem and right of return of Palestinian refugees. In November 2018 Corbin wrote and presented a major investigation into the Russian Novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury on the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey of Wiltshire police, also poisoned in the attack, gave Corbin an exclusive interview in this film which examined the part played by the GRU, the Russian state and President Putin in the attack. In April 2019 Corbin's film for the BBC 'The Shadow Commander\\" investigated the role played in many wars and intelligence led operations in the Middle East by the powerful Commander of the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guard of Iran - General Qassem Suleimani. She predicted that he would be a major target for the Americans - Suleimani was killed by a US strike in Iraq nine months later. Jane has been reporting in 2020 on the Coronavirus crisis in the UK for Panorama and her most recent film 'On the NHS Frontline\\" tells the inside story of how a hospital in the hotspot of the Midlands coped with Covid 19 during the peak of the epidemic. Corbin is a three-time winner of the Royal Television Society Award and is an Emmy Award nominee. She has given expert testimony before various Committees of the House of Commons on Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq and also on Al-Qaeda. She has written two books, Gaza First and Al Qaeda: the terror network that threatens the world. Private life Jane Corbin has two children from her marriage to the late Conservative MP and peer John Maples, who died in 2012.

Based on the previously introduced BMW K100, the K1 was designed for comfortable high-speed autobahn cruising at speeds of up to . The radical aerodynamic design was a seven piece glass fibre structure, creating a class leading drag coefficient of 0.34. It was mated with a stiffened chassis, that included a single sided Paralever swingarm, designed to stop shaft drive induced pitch and dive under heavy acceleration and braking, the first use of this on a K-series bike. Although expensive and either loved or hated, and with some of its early technology either working in use or not--the enclosure created excess heat buildup, while the long wheelbase created a turning circle--the short production run created the result that the motorcycling press and public never had the same view of BMW motorcycles again. Background: solution to a marketing problem Through the need to meet proposed European Union legislation on emissions regulation, BMW had started to develop an alternate technology to its traditional flat- twin engines with the introduction of the 1,000 cc BMW K100 from 1983 to 1992. Led by Josef Fritzenwenger and Stefan Pachernegg, the team developed a design prototype based on a liquid-cooled Peugeot car engine. In the base design of the K100, the engine was laid on its side in line with the motorcycle frame, known as a longitudinal four, with the crankshaft on the right hand side of the motorcycle, with the cylinders, pistons, camshafts, injectors and spark plugs on the left hand side. This arrangement keeps the centre of gravity relatively low, which benefits handling. Design The K100 was still a cruiser/tourer design in bias, and BMW marketing wanted a sports oriented tourer to appeal to a more youth oriented market perception, and compete with the Japanese factories. BMW was committed to the manufacturer imposed limit for motorcycles sold in Germany, so decided that to address both issues it needed to turn to aerodynamics to solve the problem. In 1984 at the Cologne Motor Show, BMW design created the aerodynamic \\"Racer\\" mockup, based on a standard K100 chassis. At the 1988 Cologne show, the production K1 used the same large and all enveloping two-piece front mud guard mated closely to a seven-piece main fairing, that included two small panniers (lids made by Zanussi ZCP (Zanussi Componenti Plastica)). The resultant drag coefficient was 0.34 with the rider prone, the lowest of any production motorcycle in 1988. Adding to the \\"different to traditional BMW\\" nature of the bike, the colour scheme of bright red or blue with yellow graphics and highlighting was bold, and hence seen as so different to normal BMW, bizarre. Engineering The K1 differed from the K100 in engineering terms, being designed for high speed and hence with many components either replaced or upgraded. Retaining the K100's bore and stroke of , the K1 was BMW's first 16-valve engine,Falloon, The BMW Story, pp. 111 using four valves per cylinder, with the camshafts acting directly on the bucket tappets. Other improvements over the K100 included higher compression pistons, lighter conrods and a lighter crankshaft. This combined with digital Motronic engine management system resulted in a gain over the K100, producing at the crankshaft at 8,000 rpm; and increased torque of versus the K100's . The stronger tubular steel chassis was mounted on wide FPS front wheels, 18s in the back, with low profile radial tyres. The rear suspension was a Bilstein shock absorber acting on a single-sided Paralever swingarm, which pushed the wheelbase out to . On the front were twin Marzocchi forks.Falloon, The BMW Story, pp. 113 The brakes were four-pot Brembo over two-pot on the K100, with a pair of drilled discs. An Anti-lock braking system was optional in all markets except North America, where it was standard. Marketing, sales and usage By the time the K1 was launched, it was quick but not fast. The result of the addition of the aerodynamic bodywork and general upgrading of engineering and components added to the weight, which as a result came in as heavy for a sports bike at . Combined with the extended wheelbase which created a turning circle, it made the bike an economical and comfortable sports tourer. But the engine was not powerful enough against the weight to make the bike quick accelerating, and hence sports-competitive. The all over fairing was found in early press road tests to retain excess heat below , and in some cases burn riders. BMW eventually offered an under-fairing heat blanket which reduced this considerably, but it was always a problem. However, as BMW knew weight was a problem, the panels were well engineered but thin and subject to cracking. Resultantly panel fit was poor on early models, and combined with panel cracking earned the bike the nickname \\"yoghurt carton\\" in Germany. The design and manufacture of the panels never changed in the bikes production, but the colouring schemes were toned down from a ketchup red and metallic blue with yellow details, to a metallic black. The engine, although well developed, suffered from secondary vibration. This was minimal in the three-cylinder K100 derived K75, and minimised in the K100 through introduction of well designed vibration suppression. On the sporting inspired K1, the engine was directly mounted onto the frame, which led to secondary vibrations problems at certain mid-range engine revolutions. In the important United States market, emissions regulations dragged the power out down to . At almost US$13,000 it was also expensive, and when compared to the competition the excess price did not offer a sufficient performance or quality gap for volume sales. In comparison, the Honda CBR600F was as fast and lighter, yet was almost two thirds of the price. By 1993, the market had changed and developed considerably, with the introduction of sports bikes like the Tadao Baba designed Honda Fireblade, brought about the end of production. However, although it only sold 6,921 units, the K1 helped BMW change its persona forever with the press and market perception as simply a touring motorcycle manufacturer. It remains one of their most memorable machines.

Pre-consumer recycled materials can be broken down and remade into similar or different materials, or can be sold \\"as is\\" to third- party buyers who then use those materials for consumer products. One of the largest contributing industries to pre-consumer recycling is the textile industry, which recycles fibers, fabrics, trims and unsold \\"new\\" garments to third-party buyers. There are generally two types of recycling: post-consumer and pre-consumer. Post-consumer recycling is the most heavily practiced form of recycling, where the materials being recycled have already passed through to the consumer. According to the Council for Textile Recycling, each year 750,000 tons of textile waste is recycled (pre- and post-consumer) into new raw materials for the automotive, furniture, mattress, coarse yarn, home furnishings, paper and other industries. Although this amount accounts for 75% of textile waste in the United States, there is little research on textile excess produced in countries that play a larger role in global textile production, such as China, Vietnam, Thailand, India and Bangladesh.

It is made from a paste of maize flour mixed with sugar and gari (cassava) or yam flour and deep-fried. It is commonly sold in ogun state in Nigeria. In a 1991 study of foods sold to schoolchildren in Lagos, samples of kokoro were bought from the stalls and subjected to microbiological analysis. Ten different types of bacteria were isolated, including bacteria associated with food poisoning and diarrhea, pointing to the need to improve control of hygiene in their preparation, and to look for ways to extend shelf life.

It was originally described as an undisplaced olecranon fracture, but more recently includes displaced fractures and can be considered a variant of the Monteggia fracture. The injury was described in 1957 by A.C. Hume of the orthopaedic surgery department of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Rochester. Cause Although the precise mechanism of injury is unclear, the injury occurs in children who have fallen heavily with their arm trapped under the body. In his original description of the injury, Hume suggested that the injury occurred as a result of hyperextension of the elbow leading to fracture of the olecranon, with pronation of the forearm leading to the radial head dislocation.  Management  In the original description by Hume, where the olecranon fractures were not displaced, treatment consisted of closed reduction of the radial head dislocation under general anaesthesia by supination of the forearm. This was followed by immobilisation of the arm in a plaster cast with the elbow flexed at 90¬∞ and the forearm in supination for 6 weeks. Where the olecranon fracture is displaced, open reduction internal fixation is recommended. Once the olecranon has been repaired, closed reduction of the radial head dislocation is usually possible. This is followed by immobilisation with the elbow flexed to 90¬∞ and the forearm in the neutral position. The duration of immobilisation depends on clinical assessment of the joint, and mobilisation may be possible after as little as 4 weeks.

Life The youngest son of Henry Ussher, he was educated at Trinity College Dublin, being made fellow in 1611, and graduating B.A. 1612, M.A. 1614, viceprovost 1615; B.D. 1621. He was prebendary of St. Audoen's, Dublin (1617); rector of Ardstraw (1617); prebendary of Dromaragh (1624); and rector of Lurgan (1629). On the death in 1627 of Sir William Temple, there was a disputed election to the Provostship. The senior Fellows elected Joseph Mead, who declined; the junior Fellows elected Ussher (14 April 1627), and he was sworn in the same day. He was set aside by royal letter in favour of William Bedell, who was sworn in on 16 August. On Bedell's promotion as Bishop of Kilmore, Ussher was again elected (3 October 1629), and sworn in 13 January 1630. He owed his appointment to a temperate letter in his favour by his cousin, James Ussher, to whom an appeal had been made. He was an able preacher, he promoted the study of the Irish language, and he defended the charter rights of the college; but was considered too dovish. On 11 August 1634 he resigned the Provostship on being appointed Archdeacon of Meath. On 25 February 1635 he was consecrated Bishop of Kildare. He died at Panta Birsley, near Ellesmere, Shropshire, on 7 September 1642, and was buried at Dudleston (Doddleston) Chapel, near Oswestry.

It is regarded as a representative animal painting (yeongmohwa) and is painted on silk with light coloring over the ink and wash painting (sumukhwa). The Myojakdo is 93.7 cm in height and 42.9 cm in width. It forms part of the collection of the National Museum of Korea in Seoul, South Korea. Description Byeon Sang-byeok is renowned for his skillful depictions of cats and chickens, so he was referred to as the nicknames, \\"Byeon goyangi\\" (literally Byeon cat),Yu, Hong-jun, An Approach through the theory on Art to theory on Painting of Scholars of the Korean Practical Science\\", Sungkyun Journal of East Asian Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2004, p.126 and \\"Byeon dak\\" (Byeon rooster) during his lifetime. The myojakdo backs up the record in which Byeon favored cats and devoted to cat paintings. Cats and sparrows were often subjects for Korean paintings drawn to celebrate the joy of longevity because of their similar pronunciations with other words that have auspicious meanings. The pronunciation of myo (; cat) and jak (, sparrow) in hanja word, or Sino-Korean words are respectively linked with mo (; old person) which refers to 80 or 90 years old, and jak () which indicates magpie having been regarded as an auspicious bird in Korean society. In this painting, cats and sparrows are depicted realistically in a simple and dynamic composition. The depiction of a group of chirping sparrows on twigs are illustrated precisely with very detailed brushstrokes. Byeon's mastered drawing techniques are also noted with the lively facial expressions and moves of the two cats. One cat clinging to the side of an old tree exchanges glances with the other on the ground in the diagonal composition as if they communicated with each other. On the other hand, the body of the old tree is drawn with rather wild brushstrokes, which represents the meager texture and the distorted shape having formed for a long time. The stark contrast between the way the animals and trees are applied gives a strong feeling of movement to the picture.

History ROTIGS is an acronym for Rapid Oral Tracheal Intubation Guidance System. The device was invented in 2007 by Otolaryngologist Brad Napier and is currently being tested at several universities in the United States. The device functions as a bite block and a mechanical guide for transoral intubation, as it awakens intubations in ways that existing oral airways do not. ROTIGS is currently patent pending in the United States, Japan and the European Union. Significance The device provides a new tool for the management of difficult airways and it facilitates Awake Minimally Invasive Bronchoscopic Intubation (AMIBI). ROTIGS uses a new approach to managing difficult airways. The design several medical applications beyond its original intended use as an appliance to allow awake intubation. Medical applications ROTIGS is a transoral appliance that facilitates awake transoral bronchoscopic intubation, laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy. Rotigs consists of a mouthpiece, bite block, and guidance tube. The mouthpiece and integral bite block keeps the device centered and allows a midline bronchoscopic approach to the larynx. The device does not rest on the tongue and does not cause gagging. By creating a gag free approach to the larynx, ROTIGS facilitates safe, awake, guided transoral intubation for the infrequent endoscopist.

Euphrasia is said to have had a vision of the Holy Family, at which point the illness she had long felt ceased. She was canonised as a saint by Pope Francis on 23 November 2014 in Vatican City. Since the beheading of St. John the Baptist is celebrated on August 29, the feast of St. Euphrasia is postponed to August 30. Early life She was born Rosa Eluvathingal on 17 October 1877 in a Syro-Malabar Catholic Nasrani family in Kattoor, Irinjalakuda, Thrissur district, in Kerala. Rosa was the eldest child of wealthy landowner Cherpukaran Antony and his wife Kunjethy. She was baptised on 25 October 1877 in Our Lady of Carmel, Forane Church, Edathiruthy. At the age of nine, Rosa is said to have experienced an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary which led her to make a commitment never to marry, and to commit her entire life to God. When she was ten, she entered the boarding school attached to the first indigenous Carmelite community in the Syro- Malabar Church, founded by Saints Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Leopold Beccaro in 1866 at Koonammavu in Ernakulam District. As she grew older, Rosa wanted to enter the Sisters of the Mother of Carmel, who follow the Rule of the Third Order of the Discalced Carmelites. Her father opposed this, as he wanted to arrange a marriage for her with the son of another prosperous family in the region. Seeing her resolve, her father eventually relented and accompanied her to the convent. Religious life In 1897, Mar John Menachery, the first native Bishop of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur, established a Carmelite Convent in Ambazakad (now belonging to the Syro- Malabar Catholic Eparchy of Irinjalakuda). On 9 May, he brought in all five nuns from Koonammavu who belonged to his diocese. The next day Rosa was received as a postulant, taking the name Sister Euphrasia of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and was admitted to the novitiate of the congregation on 10 January 1898. Her constant poor health, however, threatened her stay in the convent, as the superiors considered dismissing her. The bed where Euphrasia died in St Mary's convent, Ollur, Thrissur, shown in the museum. Euphrasia is said to have had a vision of the Holy Family, at which point the illness she had long felt ceased. Euphrasia made her solemn profession on 24 May 1900, during the blessing of the newly founded St. Mary's Convent, Ollur or Chinna Roma. After she took her perpetual vows, she was appointed assistant to the Novice Mistress. Though frail in health, in 1904 Euphrasia was appointed Novice Mistress of the congregation. She held this position for nine years until 1913, when she was made Mother Superior of the convent, where she was to live the rest of her life, serving as Mother Superior until 1916. She endeavoured to lead a life of constant prayer and of devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, becoming known to many people as the Praying Mother. Euphrasia spent much of her day in the convent chapel before the Blessed Sacrament, to which she had a strong devotion. She also nourished a great love and devotion for the Virgin Mary. Euphrasia died on 29 August 1952 at St. Mary's Convent. Her tomb has become a pilgrimage site as miracles have been reported by some of the faithful. Miracles The first reported miracle was curing a carpenter from bone cancer. Thomas Tharakan from Anchery in Ollur, a furniture polishing worker, was diagnosed with cancer by the Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute in Thrissur. Thomas was admitted to the hospital for one week. Later before the surgery, a scan by the doctor showed no sign of tumour, despite an earlier scan report showing clear evidence of a tumour. Thomas's sister, Rosy, later claimed that cure was the result of her prayer to Euphrasia. The second reported miracle happened to a seven-year old child named Jewel from Aloor in Thrissur District. The child had a tumour in his neck which made it difficult for him to swallow any food. Doctors at Dhanya Hospital in Potta, Thrissur District, had said that this disease was incurable. As Jewel's family came from a poor background, their only option was to pray for divine intercession. After his grandmother prayed to Euphrasia, doctors noticed that his tumour began to shrink. Dr Sasikumar of Dhanya Hospital examined him once again and found the tumour to have disappeared. Many other doctors examined the boy and stated that there was no medical basis for this event. Stages of canonisation Servant of God On 27 September 1986 the process of canonisation began in Ollur. On 13 August 1987 Father Lucas Vithuvatikal was appointed as Postulator. He made the oath as Postulator in the presence of Mar Joseph Kundukulam, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Thrissur on 29 August 1987 and Euphrasia was declared a \\"Servant of God\\" on the same day. Venerable Sister Perigrin was appointed as Vice-Postulator on 9 September 1987 and in 1988 a Diocesan Tribunal for the Cause of Euphrasia was established by Kundukulam, established an apostolic miracle on 8 January 1989. and concluded its work on 19 June 1991. On 30 January 1990 the tomb of Euphrasia was opened and her remains were transferred to a newly built tomb inside the chapel of St. Mary's Convent. Her case was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, Rome, on 20 April 1994, and on 5 July 2002 Pope John Paul II declared her \\"Venerable\\". Blessed She was beatified on 3 December 2006 in St. Anthony's Forane Church, Ollur, with the declaration of the Major Archbishop, Varkey Vithayathil, on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Apostolic Nuncio to India Archbishop Pedro L√≥pez Quintana and Archbishop Jacob Thoomkuzhy of the Syro- Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur joined 30 prelates and 500 priests for the beatification events. Saint On 3 April 2014, Pope Francis authorised the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to promulgate the decrees concerning the miracle attributed to Euphrasia's intercession. This confirmed the Pope's approval of Euphrasia's canonisation. At a special Mass held at St Peter's Square at Vatican City on 23 November 2014, Pope Francis canonised Euphrasia as a saint. Mother Sancta, Mother General of Congregation of the Mother of Carmel (CMC), carried the relics of Euphrasia to the altar.

The 7th Operations Group currently flies the B-1 Lancer. The 7th Operations Group is a direct successor organization of the 7th Bombardment Group, one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the United States Army before World War II. Activated in 1921, it inherited the lineage of the 1st Army Observation Group, which was established and organized, on 6 September 1918. The 7th Bombardment Group was deploying to the Philippines when the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Six of the group's B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft which had left Hamilton Field, California on 6 December 1941 reached Hawaii during the enemy attack, but were able to land safely. The unit later served in India during World War II. In the postwar era, the 7d Bombardment Group was one of the first USAAF units assigned to the Strategic Air Command on 1 October 1946, prior to the establishment of the United States Air Force. Equipped with low-hour B-29 Superfortress surplus World War II aircraft, the group was inactivated in 1952 when the parent wing adopted the Tri-Deputate organization and assigned all of the group's squadrons directly to the wing. Reactivated as the 7th Operations Group in 1991 when the 7th Bomb Wing adopted the USAF Objective organization plan. Assigned Units The 7 OG (Tail Code: DY) consists of the following units: * 7th Operations Support Squadron * 9th Bomb Squadron * 28th Bomb Squadron * 436th Training Squadron Both the 9th and 28th Bomb Squadrons fought in combat on the Western Front of World War I, and histories predate that of the Operations Group. Heraldry The group's emblem, approved in 1933, features three crosses symbolizing its squadrons' battle honors. The diagonal stripe was taken from the coat of arms of Province of Lorraine which France took back from Germany in World War I. History : For additional history and lineage, see 7th Bomb Wing World War I Men of the 24th Aero Squadron pose in front of a Salmson 2.A2, Vavincourt Aerodrome, France, November 1918 In the summer of 1918 and the organization of the United States First Army in France, the First Army Observation Group was organized at Gondreville-sur-Moselle Aerodrome on 6 September. The group initially consisted of the 91st and 24th Aero Squadrons, which flew over the front into enemy territory. Aircraft from the group took numerous air photos and compiled maps of enemy troop concentrations, road convoys, railway traffic, artillery and other targets during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel in mid-September. Gorrell, On 22 September, the group changed stations, moving to Vavincourt Aerodrome. At Vavincourt, the 9th Aero Squadron (Night Observation) was assigned to the unit. With the addition of the 9th, both day and night patrols were made over enemy territory, with intelligence being returned to First Army headquarters. The duties of the group consisted of long-distance patrols far into the enemy rear areas, both visual and photographic. Special attention was paid to enemy movements on roads, canals and railways. Railway stations and marshalling yards were noted, along with supply depots, airfields and munition storage areas. Once located, they were kept under routine observation. Also, the locations of enemy heavy artillery batteries were monitored and their movements recorded. The First Army OG flew no less than 521 successful missions, with a total of 1,271 sorties being made. Daily battles with enemy aircraft were engaged, with the group shooting down 50 aircraft in 111 aerial combats. With the Armistice with Germany being reached on 11 November 1918, the group ceased flying into enemy territory, but maintained an alert for several weeks afterward. Between the wars After World War I, the Army Air Service was re-organized on a permanent basis. The 1st Army Observation Group was organized at Park Field, Memphis, Tennessee on 1 October 1919. It was transferred to Langley Field, Virginia and was assigned the 1st, 12th and 88th Aero Squadrons, equipped with surplus de Havilland DH-4s. On 14 March 1921, with the formation of the United States Army Air Service, it was re- designated as the 7th Observation Group. It was inactivated due to funding issues on 30 August 1921.Clay, Curtiss B-2 Condor formation flight over Atlantic City, N.J. S/N 28-399 is in the foreground (tail section only). Aircraft were assigned to 11th Bombardment Squadron, 7th Bombardment Group at Rockwell Field, California. This flight of 4 aircraft completed cross-country flight to Atlantic City, NJ. The group was re-formed at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California and activated on 1 June 1928. The re-formed Group was assigned the 9th, 11th, 22d and 31st Bombardment Squadrons. The 9th, 11th and 31st squadrons lent their World War I lineage to the group's emblem as indicated by the three Maltese Crosses on the shield. While the group was assigned at Rockwell Field, the fledgling Air Force was testing new theories and ideas. In early 1931, the 7th began training aircrews in radio-controlled interception. A bomber, acting as a target, reported by radio to a ground station, giving location, altitude and course. Armed with this information, ground controllers guided pursuit aircraft to the objective. The 7th was transferred to March Field, Riverside California, on 29 October 1931 with its 11th Squadron joining the 9th and 31st Bombardment Squadrons which had been activated on 1 April 1931, but had not been manned. The Curtiss B-2 Condor was flown by the 11th; the 9th flew the Keystone B-4; while the 31st flew 0-35s, B-1s, and B-7s. A sprinkling of other aircraft types from the era was also found among the squadrons. The 7th trained and participated in aerial reviews, assisted in atmospheric experiments, dropped food and medical supplies to people marooned or lost, and took part in massive Army maneuvers during the 1930s flying Curtiss and Keystone biplane bombers, then Martin B-12s, For 102 days in 1934 the Army Air Corps flew domestic air mail routes, assigned to the job by an executive order from the White House. This followed a year long investigation that alleged fraud and collusion among the dozen or so airlines who hauled the mail for a subsidy of fifty four cents per mile own. Following the closure of Rockwell Field in San Diego, the 7th had to make room at March for the 19th Bomb Group. Overcrowding at March and the opening of the new Hamilton Field near San Francisco led the group to be transferred on 22 May 1937 and equipped with B-18 Bolos. Equipped with the new B-17C in 1939, runway issues at Hamilton Field forced a transfer to Fort Douglas/Salt Lake City Municipal Airport, Utah on 1 September 1940 which could better handle the large, heavy bombers. In Utah, the group was re-equipped with the B-17E ‚Äì the first Fortress to introduce a completely new rear fuselage with a manually operated turret housing two 0.50-inch machine guns fitted in the extreme tail. With the crisis in the Pacific in late 1941, ground elements departed from Fort Douglas 13 November 1941 and sailed from the port of San Francisco on 21 November on an army transport en route to the Philippines. Aircraft and crews began departing Muroc Field, CA, on 6 December en route to Hawaii. Elements of the group flew their B-17s into Hickam Field at the height of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. World War II A captured B-17E (AAF Ser. No. 41-2471) of the 7th Bomb Group in Japanese service, 1942. The aircraft crash landed on 8 February 1942 at Yogyakarta, Java and was abandoned. It was repaired by the Japanese and used for training to develop fighter tactics against the B-17. The eventual fate of this aircraft is unknown. The group was in the process of moving to the Philippines when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Six of the Group's B-17 aircraft left Utah on 5 December for deployment to the Far East. Six of them arrived in Hawaii but landed safely at alternate airfields, avoiding destruction by the attacking Japanese aircraft. The rest of them were ordered to defend California against the Japanese threat, since in the hysteria of the moment the Japanese fleet was expected to show up off the Pacific Coast at any time. The ground echelon, on board a ship in the Pacific Ocean, was diverted to Brisbane, Australia. The air echelon moved its B-17Es via North Africa and India to Java, where from 14 January to 1 March 1942, it operated against the Japanese advancing through the Philippines and Netherlands East Indies. Received the Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for its action against enemy aircraft, ground installations, warships and transports. Moulmein-Ye rail line, Burma, 1945. The group's B-17Es were distributed to other bomb squadrons in Australia, and the air echelon was reunited with the ground echelon in India in March 1942, being equipped with longer-range B-24 Liberators. From bases in India, the group resumed combat under Tenth Air Force against targets in Burma. It received B-25 Mitchells and LB-30s in early 1942 but by the end of the year had converted entirely to B-24s. From then through September 1945, bombed airfields, fuel and supply dumps, locomotive works, railways, bridges, docks, warehouses, shipping, and troop concentrations in Burma and struck oil refineries in Thailand, power plants in China and enemy shipping in the Andaman Sea. Ceased bombing operations in late May 1945 and was attached to the Air Transport Command to haul gasoline over \\"The Hump\\" from India to China. Received second DUC for damaging enemy's line of supply in Southeast Asia with an attack against rail lines and bridges in Thailand on 19 March 1945. Returned to US in December 1945 and inactivated the following month. Cold War Activated on 1 October 1946 as a B-29 bombardment group and trained with B-29s in global bombardment operations, November 1947 ‚Äì December 1948. Personnel and aircraft of the new group, consisting of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, were transferred to Fort Worth AAF from the 92nd Bombardment Group at Spokane AAFld, Washington. Arrival of the first B-36A at Carswell \\"City of Fort Worth\\" (AF Serial No. 44-92015), in June 1948 along with a 7th Bomb Wing B-29. With its B-29s, the 7th prepared its people for any combat eventuality that might arise, flying simulated bombing missions over various cities. On 5 July 1947, a flight of eight B-29s of the 492nd Bomb Squadron deployed from Fort Worth AAF to Yokota AB, Japan. Shortly after this the detachment received orders to redeploy to Fort Worth AAF via Washington, D.C. The aircraft left Yokota AB on 2 August, flew over the Aleutian Islands, then into Anchorage, Alaska. From Anchorage the flight flew over Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, turned south and flew over Minnesota and Wisconsin. The bombers flew a low-level flight between The Pentagon and Washington Monument in the Capitol on 3 August. Completing this aerial demonstration, they headed for Fort Worth, landing 31 hours after launch from Japan and covering 7,086 miles. On 12 September, the group deployed 30 B-29s to Giebelstadt Army Airfield, near W√ºrzburg, West Germany. This flight was the largest bomber formation flown from Fort Worth AAF overseas to date, landing in Germany on 13 September. During their ten-day stay, the group bombers participated in training operations over Europe, as well as a show-of-force display by the United States in the early part of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The flight redeployed from Germany on 23 September. On 17 November 1947, the 7th Bombardment Wing was established to organize and train a force capable of immediate and sustained long range offensive warfare and operations in any part of the world. The 7th Bombardment Group became its operational component. The wing's mission was to prepare for global strategic bombardment in the event of hostilities. Under various designations, the 7th Bomb Wing flew a wide variety of aircraft at the base until its inactivation in 1993. In June 1948 the first Consolidated B-36A Peacekeeper was delivered. The first B-36 was designated the \\"City of Fort Worth\\" (AF Serial No. 44-92015), and was assigned to the 492d Bomb Squadron. With the arrival of the B-36s, the wing was redesignated as the 7th Bombardment Wing, Heavy on 1 August. B-36s continued to arrive throughout 1948, with the last B-29 being transferred on 6 December to the 97th Bomb Group at Biggs AFB. For 10 years, the \\"Peacemaker\\" cast a large shadow on the Iron Curtain and served as our nations major deterrent weapons system. As part of the 7th Bomb Wing, the 11th Bomb Group was activated on 1 December with the 26th, 42nd, and 98th Bomb Squadrons, Heavy, were activated and assigned. The 11th Bomb Group was equipped with B-36As for training purposes. A five ship B-36 formation was flown on 15 January 1949, in an air review over Washington, D.C., commemorating the inauguration of the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman. In February 1949, a B-50 Superfortress (developed from the famed B-29) and named Lucky Lady II took off from Carswell for the first nonstop flight around the world. She returned to Carswell after mid-air refueling, flying 23,108 miles, and remaining aloft for ninety-four hours and one minute. In January 1951, the 7th took part in a special training mission to the United Kingdom. The purpose of the mission was to evaluate the B-36D under simulated war plan conditions. Also, further evaluate the equivalent airspeed and compression tactics for heavy bombardment aircraft. The aircraft, staging through Limestone AFB, Maine, would land at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, following a night radar bombing attack on Helgoland, West Germany. From there the bombers would conduct a simulated bomb run on the Heston Bomb Plot, London, finally landing at RAF Lakenheath. This was the first deployment of wing and SAC B-36 aircraft to England and Europe. For the next four days the flight flew sorties out of England. The aircraft redeployed to the states on 20 January arriving at Carswell on 21 January. On 16 February 1951 became a paper organization. With all assigned flying squadrons reassigned directly to the 7 Bombardment Wing as part of the Tri-Deputate organization plan adopted by the wing. The group inactivated on 16 June 1952. Post 1992 As part of a major Air Force-wide reorganization due to the implementation of the Objective Wing organization, the Group was redesignated 7 Operations Group and again became the combat element of the 7 Wing. It controlled two B-52 squadrons and one KC-135 air refueling squadron. When flying operations ended at Carswell AFB, TX in December 1992, the group inactivated the following month. Upon activation of the 7 Wing at Dyess AFB, TX on 1 October 1993, the group again activated as the combat element of the wing. Equipped with B-1B and C-130 aircraft, the group's mission included bombardment and tactical airlift. It lost its airlift responsibilities in April 1997. At that time it also gained a conventional bombing mission. In November 1998, deployed several aircraft to Oman in support of Operation Desert Fox, where the B-1 flew its first combat missions on 17 and 18 December 1998. Since 1999, trained bomber aircrews for global conventional bombing.

The rover would have been solar powered, with a maximum mass of 300 kg and based largely on the Curiosity rover components, but would have entailed a system tailored to the specific payload. The MAX-C rover would have performed an in-situ astrobiological exploration, evaluate the habitability potential of various Martian environments, and it would have collected, documented, and cached samples for potential return to Earth by a future mission.Strategic Technology Development for Future Mars Missions (2013-2022) (PDF) 15 September 2009  History  The essential energy, water, and nutrient requirements to support and sustain life on Mars are currently present, and the Martian geologic record offers tantalizing clue of many ancient habitable environments. If life emerged and evolved on early Mars then it is possible, and indeed likely, that physical or chemical biosignatures are preserved in the exposed rock record. These discoveries and inferences make a compelling case for a rover mission designed to explore for evidence of past Martian life. For over a decade, the Mars Exploration Program has pursued a strategy of \\"follow the water\\". While this strategy has been highly successful in the Mars missions of 1996-2007, it is increasingly appreciated that assessing the full astrobiological potential of Martian environments requires going beyond the identification of locations where liquid water was present. Thus, in order to seek signs of past or present life on Mars, it is necessary to characterize more comprehensively the macroscopic and microscopic fabric of sedimentary materials. This type of information would be critical to select and cache of relevant samples for addressing the life question in samples intended for study in sophisticated laboratories on Earth. The possible strategy of using rovers to collect and cache geological samples for possible subsequent return to Earth has been discussed as far back as at least the mid-1990s. In 2007 it was recommended sample caching on all surface missions that follow the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover, in a way that would prepare for a relatively early return of samples to Earth. In mid-2007, NASA directed that a very simple cache be added to the Curiosity rover and, although they endorsed the potential value of sample caching, experts raised serious concerns regarding sample quality for this specific implementation. In November 2008, the cache was descoped to make room for tools to clean the rover's sample acquisition equipment, which were added due to sample handling problems encountered by the Phoenix lander. A mid-range rover concept was originally included in the planning work of the Mars Architecture Tiger Team (MATT). By the time of the MATT-3 report in 2009, the potential mission was referred to with several different working names, including both 'Mid-Range Rover' and 'Mars Prospector Rover', and the mission concept was generically envisioned as including a single Mars Exploration Rover or Mars Science Laboratory-class rover with precision landing and sampling/caching capability. To provide a name that fit the mission concept better, it was changed in August 2009 from the generic Mid-Range Rover (MRR) to Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher (MAX-C). Both MAX-C and Mars 2020 rover were envisioned to use features developed for the Curiosity rover In April 2011, because of a budgeting crisis, a proposal was announced to fly only one rover in 2018 that would be larger than either of the vehicles in the paired concept, ExoMars (ESA) and MAX-C (NASA). One suggestion was that the new vehicle be built in Europe and take on a combination of European and USA instruments. NASA proposed to provide a launch rocket and the \\"Sky Crane\\" landing system. In February 2012, NASA terminated its participation in ExoMars due to budgetary cuts, and when Congress reinstated funding for Mars exploration after a loud outcry from planetary scientists and enthusiasts, NASA announced in December 2012 the Mars 2020 rover and, later, that it would indeed prepare a sample cache.Instruments selected for Mars 2020, NASA's latest rover. Astrobites, Joseph O'Rourke. September 9, 2014.  Objectives  The main objective was at a site with high preservation potential for physical and chemical biosignatures, evaluate paleo-environmental conditions, characterize the potential for preservation of biosignatures, and access multiple sequences of geological units in a search for evidence of past life and/or prebiotic chemistry. Samples necessary to achieve the scientific objectives of the proposed future sample return mission would be collected, documented, and packaged in a manner suitable for potential return to Earth. The primary science objective was to land at a site interpreted to represent high habitability potential, and with high preservation potential for physical and chemical biosignatures: * Early Noachian astrobiology ‚Äî Prebiotic environmental context in which life potentially arose. * Noachian-Hesperian stratigraphy ‚Äî Whether surface conditions before and after the decline in erosion, aqueous weathering, fluvial activity, and magnetic field were habitable. * Astrobiology ‚Äî Test life-related hypotheses in the context of another specific kind of geologic terrain. Sample collection that could have preserved evidence of prebiotic chemistry or life on Mars; characterize the potential for the preservation of biosignatures. * Methane emission from subsurface. * Radiometric dating * Deep core drill ‚Äî Core samples from a depth of ~ 2m * Polar layered deposits ‚Äî Investigate potential record of recent global climate changes. * Mid-latitude shallow ice ‚Äî Investigate the habitability of mid-latitude ice, and how does perchlorate affect the present habitability of Mars. Could mid-latitude ice provide a resource for In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU)? A secondary science objective would have been to address the need for long-term atmospheric pressure data from the Martian surface. There were studies evaluating the possibilities for cooperative science between the MAX-C rover and the ExoMars rover if landed together at the same location.  Landing  The proposed MAX-C mission would have arrived at Mars in January 2019 in the northern hemisphere during winter, given the favorable atmospheric pressure at this season and performance of the 'sky crane' delivery system. Due to the eccentricity of the Martian orbit, latitude access for a solar powered rover, northern latitudes are less severe on the power/thermal design than southern latitudes, allowing effective operation at sites as far north as 25¬∞N and as far south as 15¬∞S. Given that scientifically interesting features often represent terrain that is too dangerous to land on, the landing ellipse is often driven to be placed right up against but not on top of features of interest. The result is that access is often a product of both ellipse size and rover traverse capability sufficient to get outside the ellipse in a reasonable amount of time relative to the mission lifetime. The entry, descent and landing system would have been of high precision with a targeting accuracy of . The solar-powered rover would have needed to have a range of no less than and a lifetime of at least one Earth year.  Rover  The MAX-C rover would have relied on significant inheritance of MSL's Curiosity rover design, flight design, test design, test and handling hardware to minimize cost and risk. This solar-powered rover required a range of no less than and a lifetime of at least 500 Martian days (sols). Since many of the geologically interesting terrains on Mars expose stratified layers on slopes in craters, channels, and hillsides, it would be extremely useful for the proposed MAX-C mission to be capable to navigate on slopes of up to 30 degrees, as both of the Spirit and Opportunity MERs have done. The mass would have been about 300 kg, bigger than the MERs, comparable in mass to the ExoMars rover, but lighter than the Curiosity rover. Proposed science instrumentation The rover would have carried instrumentation sufficient to scientifically select samples for caching. It was assumed that this translates to the following instruments and capabilities: *Must be able to remotely (i.e. with mast-mounted instruments) characterize outcrops and identify features of interest (panoramic camera, Near-IR Spectrometer) *Must be able to collect microscaleimagery of outcrops; contact instrument (microscopic imager) *Must be able to expose unweathered rock surfaces using a surface abrasion tool (abrading bits) *Must be able to measure mineralogy at micro-scales on the abraded rock surfaces; contact instrument (Raman spectroscopy) *Must be able to measure bulk elemental chemistry on the abraded rock surfaces; contact instrument (Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer) *Must be able to measure organic compounds on the abraded rock surfaces; contact instrument (Raman spectroscopy) *Must be able to correlate composition to micro-scale structures and textures in the rocks (microscopic imager)  Sample cache  Returning samples from Mars is essential to meeting the Mars Exploration Program's highest priority scientific objectives. However, a Mars sample return mission entails high cost and risk, and it entails scientific sample selection, acquisition, and documentation for potential return to Earth, so it must also deliver unprecedented value. Even though any sample returned from Mars would be useful for some line of scientific inquiry, it is also true that not all samples would be equally useful for detailed scientific investigation. To address the highest priority scientific questions, selection of \\"outstanding samples\\" would be required. Samples necessary to achieve the scientific objectives of the proposed future sample return mission would be collected, documented, and packaged in a manner suitable for potential return to Earth. A future surface rendezvous would recover the cache and load it into the 'Mars Ascent Vehicle' for its delivery to Earth.'Bringing back Mars life' MSNBC News, February 24, 2010 by Alan Boyle. If, at the MSL Curiosity rover landing site (2012), scientists do not recognize an outstanding sample, they will want to send a rover to an alternate site selected from orbital data and for which an argument could be made that there is better science or access potential; if MSL does discover outstanding samples, scientists would presumably want to send a rover back to collect them for return, therefore, having the MAX-C developed for a 2018 launch could have saved time and resources. The proposed sampling requirement would be to collect 20 samples at four sites outside the landing ellipse within one Earth year. The rover would then drive to a safe location to deposit the 20-sample cache for a fetch rover to potentially retrieve sometime after 2020. For such a scenario, the MAX-C rover would be expected to traverse 10 km in 150 driving sols, i.e., ~67 m/sol on average, so an improved rover autonomy would be needed for the candidate MAX-C mission. The MAX-C rover would have been able to acquire samples through coring and abrasion. Coring was to be accomplished through the use of a core drill that could produce cores of approximately 10 mm diameter up to 50 mm long, which would be encapsulated in individual sleeves with pressed-in caps. Abrading of surface material would be accomplished through the use of a specialized abrading bit placed in the coring tool. This tool would be intended to remove small amounts of surface material in order to allow instruments access past any dust and/or weathering layer. It would abrade a circular area of similar diameter to the core (8‚Äì10 mm). Translation of the arm would be used to scan the individual abrasion spots. The rover should be able to cache at least 38 core samples.  Technology development  A cost of $70M was estimated to fund the technology development activities; the mission concept would require technology development in four key areas: * Coring, encapsulation, and caching: Lightweight tools/mechanisms for obtaining and handling cored samples. * Instruments: Additional technology focus to mature instruments that could address the measurement needs posed herein, particularly the micro-scale mineralogy, organics, and elemental composition mapping. * Planetary protection/contamination control: Bio-cleaning, cataloguing of bio- contaminants, and transport modeling to ensure cached samples would be returnable. * Rover navigation: On-board image processing and navigation to increase traverse rate. * Precision landing: A major scientific priority is to improve access to complex terrain, which requires significantly narrowing the landing ellipse. Based on a draft project schedule and a full JPL team experimental study, total project cost in dollars, not including launch vehicle, was estimated to be between $1.5-2.0 Billion.

Prior to taking up the repertory for which he became famous, he was notable in operetta.Cervenka, Gottfried (18 April 2006). \\"Sch√∂ner Mann mit erotischer Stimme\\". √ñsterreichischer Rundfunk. Retrieved 13 May 2013 Pattiera was a handsome man with an exceptional, dark heroic tenor voice, that was, some say, perfectly suited for roles such as Manrico in Il trovatore. It was in this role that he made his stage debut at the Dresden Opera in 1914 and it was in the Italian repertoire that he specialized. Among his closest friends and colleagues during the early days at Dresden were Richard Tauber and Elisabeth Rethberg. Pattiera was the most popular tenor in Dresden in the 1920s. It was during that time he partnered with the soprano Meta Seinemeyer and was responsible for a resurgence of interest in Giuseppe Verdi's operas in Germany. Singing with Seinemeyer under Fritz Busch, they gave performances of La forza del destino and Don Carlos in notable productions.Steane (1998), p. 918 In addition to his work in Dresden in the Italian repertoire, Pattiera sang Tannh√§user and the role of Bacchus in Ariadne auf Naxos, was a guest artist in several European cities, and joined the Chicago Opera Company for the 1920/21 season. On 31 January 1925, the Dresden premiere of Umberto Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier was given with Seinemeyer as Maddalena. It won praise from the composer himself, who was in the audience. Tino Pattiera, who became her most famous stage and recording partner, sang the title role.Steane (2008), p. 370 On occasion compared with Caruso during his partnership with Seinemeyer, Steane notes \\"that Dresdeners are said to have compared their performances together to the Melba-Caruso evenings at Covent Garden. Pattiera gave his last performance in 1953 in Dresden and then retired, after which he taught in Vienna. He died in 1966 and is buried in his hometown of Cavtat.

Entertainment career After finishing his career as a professional footballer, Rawlinson adopted the stage name of Spike Rawlings. His early career was spent warming audiences up on local TV show Those Wonderful TV Times.

Resident in England since 1949, she has been influential in raising the country‚Äôs awareness of Italian cuisine: her 1976 Portrait of Pasta has been described as ‚Äòthe instrumental force in leading [the English] beyond the land of spag bol, macaroni cheese and tinned ravioli‚Äô. Still in 2009 she remained critical of ‚ÄòBritalian‚Äô cookery, however: mixing too many ingredients and suffering from the English palate‚Äôs liking for much stronger flavours, it lacked the subtleties of its Mediterranean original. Life and works Del Conte was born in 1925 into a prosperous and cultured Milanese family; her father was a stockbroker and Anglophile, while her mother, with whom she had a tempestuous relationship, was of ‚Äògood aristocratic stock‚Äô. Born three years after the March on Rome, the Fascist state ideology was a consistent presence in her early life: her father's work required him to be a member of the Fascist Party, and she has recalled having to wear ‚Äòsilly armbands and uniforms otherwise you couldn‚Äôt go to school‚Äô. After spending a part of the war years in Emilia-Romagna ‚Äì where twice she was arrested on suspicion of involvement with the partisans, and where she was strafed by Allied fighter aircraft while cycling on a county road ‚Äì the family returned to Milan. Here, having lost most of his money, her father returned to work while she studied history at the University of Milan before moving to England in 1949 to learn English while working as an au pair. She has said that at the time food in Britain was not something you discussed but that you ate. In England, she subsequently married Oliver Waley (1925‚Äì2007), and engaged in part-time work as the couple raised a family. In mid-life she turned to cookery writing. Her first book, Portrait of Pasta, was published in 1976. An adaptation of Marcella Hazan‚Äôs Classic Italian Cookbook for a British readership followed and in 1984 The Gastronomy of Italy, an encyclop√¶dic work covering the topic from the Roman period to the present for which she was awarded the Duchessa Maria Luigia di Parma prize. Subsequent books included Entertaining all‚ÄôItaliana (1991), shortlisted for the Andr√© Simon Award, and The Classic Food of Northern Italy (1995) which received the Orio Vergani prize from the Accademia Italiana della Cucina, as well as an award from the Guild of Food Writers. In 2009 she published Risotto with Nettles: A Memoir with Food in which she places her recipes in the context of her memories of a life in Italy and England. She has also written many articles for Sainsbury‚Äôs Magazine, winning a Glenfiddich Award in 1999. In an interview with The Guardian, she said that she believed the British \\"lost their connection with good food through having had their industrial revolution so early. 'Ours came only after the second world war; until then, people had much more connection with the land.'\\" Higgins, Charlotte. Cooking with my hero, The Guardian, 4 August 2006. In that same interview, she said, \\"I didn't set out to be a cookery writer. I wanted to be an opera singer. However, since I did not have much musical talent, it was rather unrealistic.\\" In her Desert Island Discs program, she said that her husband was her 'chief taster' because he had a British palate, so could tell her what she could expect her readers to feel. She mentioned that she never did any TV cooking series because she felt she came over as a cold person and expressed her view that whatever you do you shouldn't serve bolognese with spaghetti as it's just the wrong shape ‚Äì tagliatelle is much better. On 22 December 2016 BBC2 aired a programme, 'The Cook Who Changed Our Lives', narrated by Nigella Lawson about Anna's life and impact on British cooking. Del Conte was awarded the honour of Ufficiale dell'Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana on 2 June 2010. It was proposed to the President by the Italian Ambassador, Giancarlo Aragona, and the honour was given in recognition of the importance of Anna Del Conte's work in keeping alive Italy's good image in the UK. Del Conte's other books include: Secrets of an Italian Kitchen, Entertaining All'Italiana and Cooking with Coco.

Manor Shelswell's toponym comes from Old English and suggest's that the settlement may originally have been the well belonging to Scield, a Saxon settler.Lobel, 1959, pages 285-289 The spring that gave rise to this well is no longer traceable. The toponym was \\"Scaldeswelle\\" in 1180 and \\"Saldeywell\\" in 1219 before evolving into the present form. Before the Norman Conquest of England the manor of Shelswell belonged to a Saxon called Edwin, but the Domesday Book records that by 1086 Shelswell had been granted to Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances. In 1093 the Bishop left Shelswell to his nephew Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, but in 1095 the Earl was imprisoned and forfeited his estates for rebelling against William Rufus. By the 12th century Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I, was Shelswell's feudal overlord. Shelswell remained part of the honour of Gloucester during the 13th century and apparently as late as 1560. Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet of Hanwell, Oxfordshire bought Shelswell in 1595 and it remained with the family of the Cope baronets until after 1675. Shelswell had a mediaeval manor house that still stood in 1530. Moats near Home Farm (OS grid reference SP611308) may mark its site. A new manor house (OS grid ref. SP603306) southwest of the former village was built either early in the 18th century according to record or in 1699 according to a date-stone found in 1875. In the 18th century that house was enlarged and plantations made to improve its parkland. In 1875, the house was almost completely demolished and replaced with Shelswell Park's present Italianate country house designed by the architect William Wilkinson.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 753 The house has a Tuscan porte- coch√®re and retains some rooms of the 18th-century house. In 1956 the 1875 house was unoccupied and falling into disrepair. Parish church Shelswell had a parish church before the end of the 11th century, and its dedication to the Northumbrian Saint Ebbe reflects the Earl of Northumbria's feudal overlordship of the manor from 1093 until 1095. From 1573 the Benefice was held with that of neighbouring Newton Purcell, and Shelswell was usually referred to as a chapel of the latter. St. Ebbe's was still standing in 1618 but became increasingly dilapidated in the 18th century and was demolished in either 1796 or 1810. Two 17th century or late 16th century figures from the church have been preserved and are in Shelswell Park northeast of the house. Late in the 20th century a Church of England benefice comprising Newton Purcell and nine other local parishes was established and named after Shelswell.Welcome to the Shelswell group of Parishes Economic and social history Shelswell was a poor parish and during the Middle Ages its population tended to decline. Its lands were enclosed in different stages. In 1497 the husband of the lady of the manor evicted people, demolished two houses and enclosed of land for arable farming. By 1528 another landowner had made further evictions and enclosures and in 1533 Brasenose College, Oxford bought a farm in the parish. By 1601 Shelswell's enclosures were complete. In 1634 the parsonage was still standing but unoccupied. No building from the former village survives today. In 1899 the Great Central Railway built its main line to London through the eastern part of the then Shelswell parish and built Finmere for Buckingham station where the line crosses the main road about northeast of Newton Purcell. Buckingham was almost from the Great Central station, so the name was subsequently shortened to the more appropriate \\"Finmere\\". British Railways closed Finmere station in 1963, and closed the section of the Great Central line through the station and parish in 1966. Shelswell was a separate civil parish until 1932 when it was merged with Newton Purcell to form the present civil parish of Newton Purcell with Shelswell. In 1939 the novelist Flora Thompson used Sheldon Park as the basis of \\"Skeldon Park\\" in Lark Rise, the first book of her Lark Rise to Candleford trilogy.

At least seven people claimed to have been infected with parasitic worm eggs by Eric Kranz, a former postgraduate student from Hempstead, New York.Carus, W. Seth.

Feb. 2001)FDA/CFSAN Risk Assessment for Food Terrorism and Other Food Safety Concerns The victims were Canadians Richard Davis, William Butler, David Fisk, and Keith Fern, with three other friends and acquaintances reported to be mildly infested. Doctors said that one of the men may have been affected by as many as 400,000 larvae. Eric Kranz was a 23-year-old postdoctoral student in parasitology at Macdonald College in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec. He shared a house with four roommates: Davis, Butler, Fisk, and Fern. The roommates were at odds with Kranz, who had not paid rent totalling $16.66, and asked him to move out. Kranz became agitated and allegedly told the roommates, \\"I'll put parasites in your food and you'll wake up dead\\". Kranz did pay the full rent balance on January 31, but the roommates evicted him anyway. Some time around February 1, Kranz prepared a festive Winter Carnival dinner for his roommates, and allegedly tainted the food with eggs stolen from the university laboratory where he studied.Carus, W. Seth. Working Paper: Bioterrorism and Biocrimes, The Illicit Use of Biological Agents Since 1900, p.14, Center for Counterproliferation Research, National Defense University (Washington, D.C. Feb. 2001) The roommates were hospitalized around February 12, and Kranz left Quebec a couple of days later. As the medical investigation continued, doctors suspected poisoning and authorities were notified. On February 25 Kranz was charged with attempted murder and a warrant was sought for his arrest.Police hunt student who put pig parasite in food, The Baltimore Afro-American, February 28, 1970. He returned voluntarily to Quebec, surrendered to authorities on the 9th of March, pleaded not guilty, and was remanded on bail. Trial and acquittal Kranz went on trial in June, 1971, charged with intentionally endangering the lives of his four roommates. There was expert evidence before the court consistent with the presence of ascaris larvae in the bodies of two of the complainants: however, opinions from three other laboratory sources were not available. The defence further claimed that the infection could have occurred by way of a recurring sewage backup into the kitchen sink of the house: a version of events which was denied by at least one of the complainants. Kranz also pointed out in the course of his testimony that his roommates could have come into contact with ascariasis eggs simply by handling his clothing. Following consideration of the evidence, Judge Gerard Laganiere held that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and Kranz was acquitted.The Montreal Gazette, 10th June, 1971 Ex-student is acquitted in parasite poison case Medical aspects About a week after the dinner, the roommates began to develop cough, dyspnea, anorexia, and fever. The symptoms did not improve, and on February 12 they sought treatment at Queen Elizabeth Hospital's emergency room with symptoms of acute respiratory distress. In addition to these symptoms physicians noted wheezing and the appearance of hives.Phills, James A., A. John Harrold, Gabriel V. Whiteman, and Lewis Perelmutter, 1970: Pulmonary infiltrates, asthma, and eosinophilia due to Ascaris suum infestation in man, The New England Journal of Medicine, 286, 965-970 The roommates were treated for pneumonia, but the infection did not respond to antibiotics. Davis and Butler were in critical condition. After about four days, the staff was able to confirm the ascariasis diagnosis upon isolating live larvae, about 4 mm long, in the sputum and gastric washings. This confirmed exposure to ascariasis ova which were in the microscopic larval stage, migrating via the blood from intestine to lung. As these larvae ascended the trachea and were swallowed again they began developing into mature worms. Four weeks after infection, the victims passed numerous immature worms in bowel movements. Physicians cleared the developing adults with a course of piperazine, effectively ending the infestation. The victims were released from the hospital March 5, but the attending physician said that one of the men would probably have permanent lung damage. This infection established a baseline case or index case for Ascaris suum infection in humans. Doctors had originally consulted Walter Reed Army Medical Center but found no precedent for human infection. Further reading * The Illicit Use of Biological Agents Since 1900, W.

Lozano won a national beauty contest at the Carnival in Colombia in 1995. She started her television career as a game show presenter, and eventually acted on such shows as Pasi√≥n de Gavilanes and La Dama de Troya. On January 10, 2009, Lozano was found dead in Pradera along with Fabio Vargas, the brother of Leonidas Vargas. Both were tortured and shot to death, which authorities said could have been retaliation from drug dealers. Biography Liliana Lozano was born in Paujil Caqueta, to Luis Carlos Lozano and Dora Garz√≥n. In 1994, Lozano won the Queen of Bambuco beauty contest in Caquet√°, and won the national beauty queen title at the annual Carnival in Colombia in 1995. Also that year, Lozano began her television career, working as a game show presenter. She also briefly appeared in the soap opera Pasi√≥n de Gavilanes (Passion of the Sparrowhawks), one of the most successful Colombian soap operas, which was seen in more than 40 countries. Lozano played a nurse on the show. Lozano also appeared on the shows La familia Cheveroni, Infieles an√≥nimos, As√≠ es la vida, Amor de mis amores and Marido a Sueldo. Her final acting appearance was in 2008 on La Dama de Troya (The Woman from Troy) as Carmentea, a character who, like Lozano herself, won the Bambuco beauty queen contest. Lozano had a romantic relationship with Pablo Martin, a Venezuelan actor who starred in the soap opera Dora, la celadora (Dora the Keeper). Lozano was also said to have been romantically involved with the former football player Faustino Asprilla, which neither of the two confirmed or denied. Some time prior to 2009, Lozano underwent facelift surgery. Death Relatives said since about 2006, Lozano had been involved in a romantic relationship with Fabio Vargas, a Colombian drug lord who led a multi-million dollar cocaine empire. On January 8, 2009, Vargas was shot to death in a hospital room by what authorities believed were two professional hitmen. On January 10, Lozano was shot to death along with Fabio Vargas, the brother of Leonidas Vargas. The bodies of Lozano and Fabio Vargas were found in a ditch outside a hotel in Pradera, a town in the Colombian department of Valle del Cauca, near Cali. Police believed the two were staying in the hotel, where they were tortured and murdered. Both bodies were found half-naked, with their hands and feet bound and plastic taped over their heads. Authorities believed the two killings could have been retaliation from drug dealers, and the fact that they so closely followed the murder of Leonidas Vargas could have been a sign of a bloody war waged to take control of Vargas' cocaine business. Valle del Cauca authorities offered a 50 million pesos reward to anyone who could provide information leading to the capture of the killers of Lozano and Fabio Vargas. Lozano spent the days before her death celebrating New Year's Day with her family in Neiva.

Orinoco had only a small amount of deck housing and was the last square-rigged sail-steamer to be built for RMSP. The Napier ships were more modern, each with a full superstructure deck and rigged as a three-masted schooner. The smaller sail plan was based on the increasing economy and reliability of their engines. Magdalena had a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine that drove a single screw, giving her a top speed of . Civilian service Magdalenas maiden voyage on 2 August 1889 was a charter by the Lord Mayor and Corporation of the City of London in which they attended the Royal Naval Review at Spithead. The review was held by Queen Victoria to honour her grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm II. Magdalena was the only merchant ship to take part. In September 1889 Magdalena joined RMSP's regular scheduled route between Southampton and the east coast of South America. The five sister ships' furnaces suffered from heat damage, so in 1891 they were lined with zinc. In 1899 Day, Summers and Company of Southampton raised the boats on Atrato, Magdalena, Thames and Clyde \\"to a boat deck clear of the promenade\\" at a cost of more than ¬£5,000. In 1903 Atrato, Magdalena and Clyde were fitted with bronze propellers costing another ¬£5,000. That December the cabins-de- luxe on Magdalena, Thames and Clyde were refurbished and the ladies' saloon on each ship was converted into more cabins. There were occasional incidents in Magdalenas career. In 1894 she was at anchor in Bahia when she was \\"fired at\\". On New Year's Eve 1904 in Montevideo she collided with the Norwegian barque Ilos. In 1909 the RMSP liner Trent grounded on a sandbank in the Caribbean and Magdalena tried unsuccessfully to tow her clear. The following year Magdalena grounded on the same bank. Just after the turn of the 20th century Magdalena and her sisters had their hulls painted white, perhaps to reflect more heat in warmer latitudes. This was short-lived as the new colour showed any grime, rust and soot, and white paint was three times the price of black. In 1902 RMSP reversed the policy and the ships were returned to their original colours. By 1905 she was deemed to be too small for the route and was used mainly on the West Indies service. In 1909 the RMSP liner Trent grounded on a sandbank in the Caribbean and Magdalena tried unsuccessfully to tow her clear. The following year Magdalena grounded on the same bank. On 12 June 1912, while en route to Barbados, Magdalena went to the aid of a barque that had been becalmed; her crew had been living on a single biscuit per man per day for 40 days. At the end of 1912 Magdalena took the England Cricket Team on a successful tour of the West Indies. War service When the United Kingdom entered the First World War in August 1914 Magdalena was 25 years old and near the end of her useful life. However, on 16 December 1915 the Admiralty requisitioned her as the troop ship HMT Magdalena. She was armed with two guns and a Royal Navy gun crew. Magdalena brought Australian troops across the Mediterranean and bringing West India Regiment troops to Europe. An influenza outbreak on board in January 1917 forced the ship into quarantine. In August 1918 Magdalena brought the Gold Coast Regiment home at the close of the East African Campaign. In Gibraltar in January 1917 Magdalenas armament was augmented with 45 boxes of type \\"E\\" smoke canisters, designed to create a smoke screen in the event of enemy attack. On 29 May 1918 the ship was berthed at Suez when the canisters caught fire. The fire took hold on the port side of the ship, and fire floats came alongside and eventually brought the fire under control. RMSP claimed ¬£12,475 compensation but the Admiralty contested liability. In 1921 the company concluded that it could not win, and reluctantly discontinued its claim. Disposal Magdalena was the last of the five sisters to survive. The Government returned her to her owners in 1920, who laid her up. Late in 1921 RMSP sold her to shipbreakers in Birkenhead for ¬£1 8s 5d per ton.

Construction of the Stephansplatz station began as part of the creation of the basic network (Grundnetz) in May 1973. Deep excavation at the site was completed in August 1977 and construction of the station then proceeded largely in an open pit.\\"Arge U-Bahn Stephansplatz\\", Arbeiter-Zeitung 20 August 1977, p. 19 (German). The U3 connection was planned from the beginning and prepared for as part of the work in the 1970s, but that part of the station only opened in 1991. In the course of digging in front of the cathedral in 1973, the Vergilius Chapel, closed off in the 18th century and completely forgotten, was rediscovered. It was excavated by archaeologists and integrated into the station. Smell The U1 station has an unpleasant smell which has given rise to urban legends.\\"Bauopfer f√ºr die Wiener U-Bahn\\", Moderne Sagen, Sagen.at, retrieved 15 June 2010 (German): Legends include a rat burial ground, a homeless person who died next to a heating installation, and accidentally walled up workers; also a reference to the past practice of sacrificing small animals for the weal of a new building. However, the true cause is that to prevent the sandy ground under the cathedral from sinking and undermining it, an organic binding agent was used to stabilise the ground. On warm days, a chemical reaction caused by the binding agent produces butyric acid, which mingles with seeping groundwater and causes the unpleasant odour and also leaves deposits in the station.Horst Prillinger, \\"Warum stinkt es in der U1-Station Stephansplatz so?\\" (\\"Why does it reek like that in the Stephansplatz U1 station?\\"), FAQ, Die Wiener U-Bahn, 2 September 2006 (German), retrieved 15 June 2010.Horst Prillinger, \\"What's that foul smell on the U1 platform at Stephansplatz?\\", FAQ, The Vienna Metro, 1 May 2007, retrieved 20 June 2010.

It is an alternative to the older Memo Posting style. There are several characteristics that distinguish a real-time posting system. # Transactions appear to customers and staff as soon as the item is posted and does not need to be re-processed at night to create the hard post. # The available balances are always up-to-date with respect to all known items. # The order of posted items does not change as may sometimes happen in memo-post systems when the memos are deleted and re-processed. # Memo-posting systems often need to go off-line while the database is re-loaded to prepare for the next day's business. Real-time systems do not need that re-load window. Sometimes real-time posting is thought to mean 'there is no batch'. This is not the case. Real-time posting systems still need to support batch processing. Batch processing is attractive for some processing as it is a cost-effective means to process large groups of items. Examples of those batches would be check (cheque) clearing files or payment exchange files. Many banking systems that implement real-time posting are also built on top of database management systems which allows for the banking system to be more available, even continuously available. The database foundation also allows for multiple batch processes to occur concurrently with more flexibility than can be easily achieved with traditional memo-post systems. Also, the database allows concurrent batch and online processing. This doesn't mean that a database couldn't be used at the core of a memo-post systems, but it would not be commonly done.

It was a term that avant-garde artists used amongst themselves to describe their passion for black culture. During 1920‚Äì1930s Paris, negrophilia was a craze when to collect African art, to listen to jazz, and to dance the Charleston, the Lindy Hop or the Black Bottom, were signs of being modern and fashionable.A Double Edged Infatuation, The Guardian, UK, Saturday 23 September 2000 Sources of inspiration were inanimate African art objects (l'art n√®gre) that found their way into Paris as a result of colonial trade with Africa as well as live performances by African-Americans, many of whom were ex-soldiers remaining in European cities after World War I, who turned to entertainment for a source of income. Perhaps the most popular revue and entertainer during this time was La Revue N√®gre (1925) starring Josephine Baker. This interest in exotic cultures had already been established within France due to the regular expositions the country held to showcase the objects and people of the French colonies. The fascination with specifically black culture and the \\"primitivised\\" existence associated with it flourished in the combined aftermath of the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) and the 1931 Colonial Exposition when artists yearned for a simpler, idyllic lifestyle to counter modern life's mechanistic violence.Jodie Blake, Le Tumulte Noir: Modernist Art and Popular Entertainment in Jazz-Age Paris, 1900‚Äì1930, 1999 Avant-garde artists recognised for their negrophilia interests include poet and art critic Guillaume Apollinaire, artists Jean Cocteau, Tristan Tzara, Man Ray, Paul Colin, surrealists Georges BatailleGeorges Bataille (ed), Document No. 4, Paris, 1929 and Michel Leiris,L'Afrique fant√¥me, Gallimard, Paris, 1988 and political activist Nancy Cunard. Nancy Cunard, Hugh G. Ford (ed.), Negro: An Anthology, 1970 The Bal N√®gre Due to World War I, France saw an influx of African colonials migrate into Paris. This sudden rise in diversity led white Parisians to become fascinated by the introduction and immersion of black cultures in the city. During the late 1920s, several Parisian nightclubs began hosting bals, or authentic African-inspired dances, which were very popular among both the black and white French crowds. These bals became one of the leading interracial social spaces in France. While African immigrants went to a bal colonial, or bal n√®gre, for recreation and fun, French surrealists often came for the scientific observation of black culture. The jazz music and sensual dancing found in black nightclubs were studied and appreciated by surrealists as major components of black civilization. Unfortunately, the \\"scandalous\\" night lifestyle of Black Africans and African Americans in France often provoked the French sexualization and fetishization of black culture. The bals were also one of the most prominent areas for interracial exchanges and relationships to occur. Hidden in the dark of night, young French and African adults could socialize and interact in ways that were highly controversial in average European society. To the average Frenchman, the bal n√®gre was considered an opportunity for exotic experiences and sexual freedom. Black party-goers were no longer thought to be in these bals for their own enjoyment, but for the interests of white guests. As the appeal of exoticism rose, the opportunity for white people to interact and dance with black people became very attractive. This promise of \\"exotic experimentation\\" made these nightclubs very popular with the French bourgeois and turned them into tourist attractions. Interracial dancing gave the French a sense of liberation from the conventions of modern society, especially since the French depiction of Africa and Africans was primitive and passionate. These progressive interracial relations did not surpass the walls of the Parisian nightclubs, though. The racial and social structures remained the same for blacks and whites in France during the early 20th century.

An onboard fire destroyed her passenger accommodation before she was completed. In 1932, another fire damaged her so severely that she was sold for scrapping, only to catch fire again before she was scrapped.  Ordering   The MSN and the NSM  MS Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft was built for the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (SMN). SMN had been founded in 1870 and its core business was the transport between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. Later the line added other destinations in the Pacific, e.g, from Java to the West Coast of the U.S.A., and even a line from Java to New York. The ships that carried passengers had to be fast and comfortable. For building these, and many other ships the SMN required, SMN had a long-standing relationship with the Nederlandsche Scheepsbouw Maatschappij (NSM), which had built all the SMN ships since c. 1905.  The order and French currency depreciation  Between 1922 and 1926 the French Franc lost 43% of its value. From 1921-1926 there was a severe international crisis in shipbuilding. In 1923 the SMN then tendered the construction of a very large ship, the later Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. The offers that came in were: Fijenoord and Wilton shipyard combination for 6,200,000 guilders; De Schelde and Wilton combination for 6,400,000; NSM 6,600,000 counting as 6,270,000 guilders due to a contract between NSM and SMN. The NSM still beat the other Dutch shipyards, because it offered a significantly faster delivery. The NSM had offered at cost price because construction would keep 1,000 employees occupied for a year. The French shipyard Soci√©t√© des Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire (ACL) offered for 4,900,000 guilders. Its offer was for two months later delivery, which counted for 50,000 guilders. The additional cost for distance, transport etc. was also budgeted as 50,000 by the SMN. Possible support by the government and municipality was not sure and thought to be maximum 450,000. All in all the difference between the offer of the NSM and Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire was 6,270,000 - 4,900,000 - 50,000 - 50,000 - 450,000 = 820,000 guilders. This was such a significant amount that the SMN decided to give the order to Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire. The English competition had also been invited to offer for P.C. Hooft. Indeed the majority of the 19 offers came from shipyards from the United Kingdom. However, all of these bids except one, were equal to or higher than the Dutch offers. It is remarkable that when the first bids had come in, the SMN contacted the NSM for a second bid in case it could not agree on the payment in French Francs and the delivery term. During the Christmas week of 1923 the SMN had negotiated with the government for the 450,000 subsidy. In that same week the NSM had negotiated with its suppliers to make a new offer, which still remained 4% (15% according to the SMN) above the French offer. However, the negotiations with ACL about payment and delivery succeeded, and so the new offer of the NSM could not be considered. The fact that so much work went to a French shipyard created a row in the Dutch press and House of Representatives. The affair was even mentioned in the British parliament. In general politics and media agreed that currency competition was to blame. More extreme points of view blamed it on the recently restricted labor hours, or on the SMN wanting to teach Dutch laborers a lesson. In fact a longer workweek could not have bridged the gap between the bids, and the fact that the SMN saved 820,000 guilders by accepting the French offer cannot be denied.  Construction   Soci√©t√© des Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire  The Soci√©t√© des Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire (ACL) was a shipyard of far more renown than any Dutch shipyard. It consisted of two companies at different locations. In Nantes there was a shipyard that could employ up to 3,000 men. It had four slipways of 135 - 165 m length. It had built many torpedo boats, gunboats, light cruisers and the like. In Saint- Nazaire there was a shipyard that could employ up to 2,000 men. It had five slipways suitable to build bigger ships. It was favorably located near the floating docks of Penho√´t and the metal works Forges de Trignac. The ACL Saint-Nazaire had a factory in Saint-Denis near Paris for the construction of turbines and explosion engines. Except for the engine factory, all locations could be modernized. At the Saint-Nazaire location, ACL had built many battleships and even two dreadnoughts. These dreadnoughts were bigger than P.C. Hooft and had far more powerful machines, so there is no reason to doubt the technical skill of the ACL. However that may be, the February 1922 Washington Naval Treaty made any battleship construction very unlikely for the near future. The logical alternative was to build big merchant ships. While many ocean liners had been built in Saint-Nazaire, this had not been done by the ACL, but by the Ateliers et Chantiers de Saint-Nazaire Penho√´t also located in Saint-Nazaire, and only separated from it by a wall.  The work progresses  Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft was laid down as yard number 256. The ship was launched on 23 April 1925. Present were: Jhr. mr. A. R√∂ell governor of North-Holland and member of the supervisory board of the SMN; Mr. Oderwald and Mr. Tegelberg, both member of the executive board of the SMN; Mr. Visker, chief engineer of the SMN; Joseph Asscher president of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce in Paris; Mr. Glaser French trade representative in The Hague; as well as many persons from the French ship building industry. In his speech the president of the ACL Mr. Naud recalled the crisis in the shipping industry: the surplus of merchant ships, the low freight prices, decreasing international transport, and finally the Washington treaties. It all made that the ACL had been extremely satisfied with the order for P.C. Hooft. Naud continued by naming some of the ships built by ACL Saint-Nazaire, mentioning the dreadnought France, and the ocean liners Sphinx, Compi√®gne, Chantilly and Fontainebleau of the Messageries Maritimes, and the Lipari of the Chargeurs R√©unis. The P.C. Hooft would be the biggest of these ocean liners. P.C. Hooft was christened by Mrs. Hooft-Labouch√®re a descendant from P.C. Hooft.  Delays  The original plan was that P.C. Hooft would make her trial trip to Amsterdam in September 1925. Due to a short strike this was delayed till October, and the first trip to the East Indies was re-planned to the second half of November, most probably 21 November. By 19 November it was known that this date would also not be met. The alleged cause was a lack of skilled laborers. The first trip to Java was then thought to leave in the second half of May 1925. In mid-December 1925 the engines had been installed, all rivetting had been done, and the cabins, saloons and the like were getting finished. I was thought that the ship would be finished at the end of January or early February 1926, with the SMN hoping for delivery in February.  On fire at the ACL shipyard  Deck plan of Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft On 20 December 1925, a little more than a month before her expected completion a fire broke out on board ship. while P.C. Hooft was still being finished at the ACL shipyard. This major fire erupted at 10 AM and was quenched at noon, but the damage was very substantial. Deck A (cf. the deck plan), where the cabins for the officers were, had to be removed completely. The saloons on deck B and about 40 cabins on deck C were destroyed. Repairs would take 10-12 months, delaying delivery with half year. In money the damage was estimated at 1,000,000 French Francs. The works of art had not been damaged, and the decoration of the music saloon was save, because it had not yet been placed. A later investigation did not find a cause for the fire. It did find the body of a guard in the hold. He had a broken neck vertebra, and one suspected that he fell while on his way to report the fire. As a consequence, the fire could get so big.  Completed in Amsterdam  On midnight in the night of 20‚Äì21 July 1926 tugboats brought P.C. Hooft from the shipyard to open sea, where the compass was corrected. At 9 AM she left Saint-Nazaire for Amsterdam. The initial plan to do the trial run on this trip had been dropped for an official trial run in August. In the morning of 23 July she arrived in IJmuiden at 10 AM. A correspondent was on board for the occasion, and noted that it all went according to plan. At 2 PM the ship was in Amsterdam. She was moored at the Javakade on Java-eiland where the SMN was based. Mr. Oderwald, of the Board of SMN was the first to enter ship, followed by the board members Mr. van Hengel and Mr. Koning. Captain Schippers reported a speed of 17 knots, and a very favorable stability. Everything seemed to end well for P.C. Hooft, but three weeks after her arrival in Amsterdam the tone was less jubilant. The 'Metaalbewerker', a magazine of the metal workers union, was the first to report that the ship had been docked immediately after arrival in port. Most of the interior carpentry still had to be done, and there was as much iron work still in primer as was already painted. Only a small part of the technical and sanitary installations was ready. Hundreds of laborers were working day and night to finish her in time for the first voyage to Java on 31 August. In view of the whole ordering process the affair was a bit embarrassing for the SMN and ACL. Mr. Tegelberg of the SMN told reporters that the delivery of a ship in such an unfinished state was: 'indeed an exceptional case of a special character'. 'The SMN absolutely required that the ship would be ready for the planned trip on 31 August. The lines to the East Indies were very busy, and all of the 2nd and third class tickets had already been sold. While the work of the ACL was of the very high quality required for warships, it was not experienced in building passenger ships of this size and quality. The SMN had therefore conferred with ACL, and ACL had agreed that the ship would be finished in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam there were many laborers available from the NSM, the SMN and other suppliers, making that the ship could be finished quicker. ACL would pay for the work in Amsterdam.'  Characteristics   Dimensions  In Batavia after the 1930 refit As built, the waterline length of Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft was , and the length between perpendiculars was , the beam was , the depth of hold till deck D was , the maximum draught was in summer, empty it was Construction displacement was 21,093 tons, maximum displacement 21,863 tons, and empty it was 10,330 tons all measured in 1016 kg tons. Gross tonnage was 14.642 tons, net 10,432 tons. The big beam was judged to have given the P.C. Hooft her high stability. There were nine watertight bulkheads in the ship, with the ship planned to stay afloat when two compartments were flooded. Above the D-Deck there were four fire-turning bulkheads. The 1930‚Äì31 refit aimed to increase the speed of P.C. Hooft. Tests in a ship model basin pointed out that her hull would generate a too pronounced bow wave at speeds of over 16.5 knots. Therefore the bow was cut off at the first bulkhead, and a new 8 feet longer bow was made. This made the entry angles of the water much better, and reduced the bow wave to more acceptable proportions. After the rebuild her waterline length was .  Machinery  Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft was powered by two two-stroke 8-cylinder diesel engines manufactured by Sulzer of Winterthur, Switzerland. These engines each developed at 100 turns a minute. The cylinder diameter was 680 mm with a 1,200 mm stroke. The crankshafts had a diameter of 460 mm. The machines were to give P.C. Hooft a speed of . While she steamed from Saint- Nazaire to be completed in Amsterdam, she was claimed to have made 17 knots, but higher speeds were quite normal for a ship that was not finished and not fully loaded. On her official trial run just before her first voyage to the East Indies, she steamed at 15 kn. The 1930-1931 refit that aimed to increase the speed of P.C. Hooft obviously required more engine power. The power required was calculated with the help of tests in a ship model basin. These resulted in a required power of . The new engines chosen were also a Sulzer type. It was higher and longer and had 9 cylinders. The extra cylinder was important, but it was outweighed by the new type of cylinder. The increased height allowed a longer stroke of the cylinders, 1,340 mm stroke in stead of 1,200 mm. The diameter of the cylinders was 760 mm instead of 680 mm. A final measure was to increase the revolutions per minute from 115 to 130. This was high for such big machines, but the trial run as well the first trip proved that the careful balancing that had been done prevented vibrations. In order to make place for the bigger engines significant changes had to be made to the ship. The engine room had to be extended towards the front, which deleted some of the fuel bunkers. Higher up on decks E some rooms / space also became part of the engine room. Further up some bathrooms and other spaces were taken by the higher width of the new funnel. A far more significant, but less visible change was the strengthening of the machine foundations. The foundation was lengthened, the number of beams under the engines was doubled, and the transverse foundation was also made more rigid. The heavier machines also required new line shafting, that was made by RDM. The new bronze propellers were made by Blohm+Voss On the port side were three two-stroke auxiliary diesel engines. Each had four 380 mm cylinders with a 660 mm stroke, generating 520 hp at 170 turns a minute. Each drove a direct current 325 KW 220 V dynamo made by 'N.V. Electrotechnische Industrie v.h. Willem Smit & Co' from Slikkerveer. These engines were important because all machines on board were driven by electricity. On starboard was a small 100 hp engine that could either drive an air compressor, or a 75 KW Dynamo. This was probably the small dynamo for lighting when the ship was in port. During the refit it was replaced by an auxiliary engine of 300 hp directly connected to an auxiliary compressor of 1,080m3/h. The last engine was a 12 hp emergency engine that could drive a compressor. The electrification of the ship would be done by Firma Groeneveld, Van de Pol & Co. from Amsterdam. This company would install 146 km of cable. The oil bunkers had a capacity of 2,010 tons. Standard procedure was to fuel up in Surabaya, and to use this fuel for the trip to the Netherlands and back again to Surabaya. In the details the ports of Sabang and Belawan also played a part. The entrance to Belawan was a bit shallow, and so the final big fuel intake before sailing to the Netherlands was done at Sabang. During the refit some fuel bunkers became part of the engine room, and some water ballast tanks were re-purposed as fuel bunkers, increasing capacity to c. 2,500 tons.  Accommodation  As built Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft had accommodation for 253 first class, 300 second class, 104 third class and 54 fourth class passengers. A better count is that of the cabins. There were 1st and 2nd class cabins for 520 passengers, part of these cabins could be used for either class. Third class and fourth class cabins could house 60 people each. There were two luxury cabins, made by Firma Reens, and a number of semi- luxury cabins, that could be assigned private bathrooms. On average there was one bathroom for every 10 persons. Almost all cabins had a porthole (cf. deck plan), something very important for travel in the tropics. The fourth class was a special case. The only people using it were soldiers below the rank of sergeant, and in case the government put them on board, temporary lodgings were made for them. The crew consisted of 262 men. The officers were: the commander, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Navigator; a chief engineer, a second engineer, 7 other engineers and 4 assistant engineers, a telegraphist, a doctor a medic and a nurse. Other staff were the administrative officer, ma√Ætre d'hotel, etc. The decoration of the first class saloons was designed by Carel Adolph Lion Cachet, who had also done previous ships of the SMN. The carpentry of the conversation rooms (Smoking lounges, Music room, and library) would be made by the N.V. Nederlandsche Fabriek van Betimmeringen v/h Gebr. Reens. The decoration of the second class saloons was done by the firm Marc Simon from Paris.  Service   Official trial run to Wight  On Friday 27 August 1926 the official trial run of P.C. Hooft could finally start. She had already been loaded with the cargo for the East Indies, when a very select company started to board: Prince Henry of the Netherlands was the most prominent guest, he was accompanied by the Colonial minister J.C. Koningsberger, the vice-president of the Council of State Wilhelmus Frederik van Leeuwen, Jhr. mr. dr. A. R√∂ell governor of North-Holland, the mayor of Amsterdam W. de Vlugt and Mrs. de Vlugt-Flentrop, the executive board of the SMN, some members of the Supervisory board of the SMN, and many other prominent people from the finance and trade sector. At 6:30 pm the ship left the Java Kade. Whilst it sailed to IJmuiden the 300 guests went to dinner. The speech in the first class was made by S.P. van Eeghen of Van Eeghen & Co, in the second class it was made by C.J.K. van Aalst of the Netherlands Trading Society. At 10:00 pm P.C. Hooft was at the big (later middle) lock in IJmuiden, where customs made that passage took an hour. Meanwhile an orchestra played for the guests. The organization of the trial run had been planned extremely well. The guests lunched and dined alternately in the first and second class. The cabins had postal cards and well-illustrated booklets about the ship. At 11:30 on Friday night, the Wijsmuller tug Nestor arrived to pull the ship from the lock to open sea. At 10:00 am on the 28th Hooft passed Dover., with Folkestone and Cap Gris Nez in view. The Hooft then passed Dungeness and steered for Beachy Head, and then Wight and Portsmouth. The Hooft rounded Wight counter-clockwise, and then made some maneuvers as a test. On Saturday evening there was another formal dinner that lasted till about two o'clock in the night. The Hooft arrived back in IJmuiden at 12 o'clock on Sunday the 29th.  First trip on the Amsterdam - Java route  P.C. Hooft was used on the Amsterdam‚ÄìJava route. Her first trip started on 31 August 1926, just two days after she had returned from the trip to Wight. The plan was to arrive in Tanjung Priok on 1 October. On 27 September arrived in Sabang and on 29 September P.C. Hooft arrived in Belawan port of Medan. On 1 October the ship arrived in Batavia. On 2 October she made a tour of the bay of Batavia with 1,200 guests. On 3 October she sailed to Cirebon with 30 guests and a reporter. On 13 October the arrived in P.C. Hooft Probolinggo. On the way back she visited Medan for a formal dinner there. From Bilawan P.C. Hooft sailed to Port Said in 13 days. On 19 November the ship arrived back in Amsterdam.  The ship becomes too slow  When she entered service in 1926 P.C. Hooft had been one of the first big ocean liners with diesel engine propulsion. Her cruise speed of 15+ knots was satisfactory for the voyage to the East Indies. Later this speed was raised somewhat by increasing the revolutions per minute of engines. However, in a few developments in Diesel engine construction made that the ship became too slow. While P.C. Hooft made 15+ knots, Christiaan Huijgens made 17+ knots, and the newer Oldebarneveld and Marnix made 18 knots. A difference in cruising speed between 15.5 knots and 17.5 knots might not seem a big deal. However, on a route that took a month's travel time, these few knots meant c. 4 days less on board ship. The guests probably did not care that much about a few days, except that they would want to pay a somewhat lower price. For the shipping line, every extra day of travel meant extra costs (i.e. 1,000 men on board) and the need to ask a higher fare price that the passenger did not want to pay. Meanwhile, the line could not use the ship to transport other people.  Refit: up-engined and lengthened  In late 1929 the SMN decided to increase the speed of P.C. Hooft. A decision to perform a major refit on a new ship is always rather awkward, but in fact this decision was counter-intuitive. Mr. Delprat of the SMN declared that for a five-year-old ship like P.C. Hooft the investment to increase the speed was justified, but for older ships like SS Jan Pieterszoon Coen and SS Johan de Wit it was not. The refit that was to increase the speed of P.C. Hooft consisted of two big alterations. 1) The machine power would be almost doubled. 2) The hull was changed so the ship could profit from the increased power. The change was announced in April 1930. On 3 December 1930 P.C. Hooft left Amsterdam for Rotterdam, where the Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij would execute the refit. On 25 March 1931, the refit P.C. Hooft left Rotterdam for trials on the North Sea. These trials were planned to last about one and a half days, with the ship arriving in Amsterdam on the 27th. A defect in the propeller shaft made that she returned to Rotterdam on the 25th. She was placed in drydock, where the defect was found to be that the gland made too much contact with the propeller shaft. The defect was quickly fixed, and in the evening of the 27th P.C. Hooft resumed her trials. On the North Sea P.C. Hooft reached 18 knots during the important full power run. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 28th she reached IJmuiden. During lunch SMN accepted delivery, and also thanked her chief engineer Ir. S.G. Visker and her ship- building engineer Ir. Prins for their advice and design of the refit.  The ship is destroyed by fire   The ship is decontaminated  On Tuesday, 8 November 1932 P.C. Hooft had returned to Amsterdam from the East Indies. The ship was moored at Sumatra Kade and all passengers and cargo were unloaded. In the evening of 12 November, all external opening of the ship were closed by the decontamination service. On 13 November that service spent the whole day treating the ship against rats. This was done using hydrogen cyanide, and with external openings closed to let the poison do its work. After the gas assumed to have done its work, all possible measures were taken to quickly purge the ship of the highly poisonous gas. Therefore all the ship and the doors, including all cabin doors and portholes had been opened from 6 PM. The operation was marked by a yellow flag with three crosses, which flew from the foremast. The flag marked that the ship had been gassed, and nobody should enter it. Therefore there was not even a guard on board.  A fire destroys the ship  In the night of 13‚Äì14 November 1932 at about 12:20 am, a fire was noted on the boat deck behind the bridge by guards walking on shore. Another guard had entered the ship in the previous evening at about 10:15 pm in order to power up the dynamo, the fans and the ventilation system. At about the same time as the guards on shore, he had noted the fire in the first class cabins behind the bridge. No wonder that a short circuit in the ventilators would later be thought to have caused the fire. The fire spread very quickly. It was not stopped by closed doors and bulkheads, and was aided by an eastern wind blowing through the open corridors, creating a chimney effect. Soon the saloons were on fire, and soon after the first class stairs were, soon followed by the first class dining room and the bridge. By 1:00 am the whole midships was ablaze. The fire department in Amsterdam was very capable to handle these kinds of events. It used the vessels Jason and Jan van der Heyden, that could both put an enormous amount of water on a fire. The normal fire department also used an enormous amount of equipment, and so over 40 fire hoses were used. In spite of this, the fire department was rather ineffective because the hydrogen cyanide prevented her from entering the ship. Attempts to extinguish the fire from the waterboard, from shore, or from the decks did nothing to stop the fire eating away on the inside. There was so much water put on the ship, that is listed, but water in the hold did not put out a fire higher up in the ship. P.C. Hooft burning near Schellingwoude At 2:30 AM the rear of the ship also started to burn, and the fight was lost. Now the SMN and the fire department wanted to prevent the burning ship from causing damage on shore. A scenario that would be very likely once the fire reached the 1,000 tons of fuel stored at the bottom of the ship. Moving the ship meant stopping the attempts to extinguish the fire, but it had to be done before the fire reached the (upwind) bow of the ship, otherwise the ship could not lower its anchors on the IJ. At 3:45 am five tugboats started to pull the P.C. Hooft backwards, with only three men on board near the anchors. At 4:00 am tugboats start to pull the burning ship eastwards to the compass buoys near Schellingwoude, on the north side of the IJ. At 4:30 it arrived there, just as the oil bunkers were catching fire. Here it was left to burn out On 17 November the fire then increased in intensity again. By then, the stern had sunk to the bottom of the IJ, but the bow was still afloat thanks to the bulkheads. On 21 November a last fire erupted, and after quenching it, the fire department declared that the fire had ended. This proved still too optimistic, because on 22 November a locked in fire of burning oil was found in the bow section. After this had been eliminated the fire had lasted for 232 hours, or almost ten days. After the fire had been put out the owners and the insurers could rather quickly determine that the ship was a total loss. At the time P.C. Hooft was insured for 7,500,000 guilders. 80% at Anglo-Dutch insurers, and 20% at own risk. On 25 November the insurers agreed to pay the full amount of 6,000,000 guilders to the SMN, and declared that they did not want to have the wreck.  Second fire on the wreck  By 24 November divers from Wijsmuller were fixing holes in the hull of P.C. Hooft. Meanwhile pumps were trying to remove an estimated 16,000 tons of water from the hull. Employees of RDM meanwhile closed up portholes with iron plating in case the ship would suddenly list further. On 8 December about 40 employees of SMN were working on the wreck. One of the things they did was cutting holes to bring in pumps ever closer to the water line (which was lowered as the ship rose out of the water). In order to reach a tank that was full of water, the employees tried to cut off an oil pipeline with a blowtorch. A spark from the blowtorch hit some oil rests, and by 10:00 am the ship was burning from oil in one of the bunkers on starboard. As a consequence all employees were required to leave the ship again. This fire was quenched on 9 December.  To the ship breakers  By 6 December the wreck had been sold to N.V. Simons Scheepssloperij in Pernis near Rotterdam. Because the ship breakers were on the Meuse, the wreck had to be moved over the North Sea. Therefore a lot of precautions had to be taken against it sinking somewhere on a busy shipping lane or canal. On 10 December at 10:00 am the wreck was brought into the Prins Hendrik dok to make her fit for transport. While the wreck had entered the drydock it listed 14 degrees, and could not be lifted. Mr. W.H. Mellema of Maritiem Kantoor W.H. Mellema en Co led the work to straighten the ship. After working with four of his men for 36 hours they succeeded in reducing the list to four degrees. Now a slow process of lifting the ship a bit and pumping out water began. At noon on 12 December, this process stopped because divers noted that the keel was not straight anymore. This meant that it was impossible to get the whole ship on the blocks. This would so much pressure at particular points of the dock that the dock would be endangered. By 5:00 pm on the 12th the ship had been lifted till a position that could not harm the dock. In the midships 200 feet of the keel was supported by the blocks. 160 feet of the bow was not on the blocks. The stern touched the blocks, but was not supported by them. It showed that the midships had sagged during the fire. However, all significant leaks were above water by then, and so they could be fixed quickly. On the 13th all stop gap repairs were also reinforced and tested. The plan was that in the morning of the 14th all leaks would be sufficiently closed, so the ship could be moved over sea. In the morning of 14 December the Prins Hendrik dok was lowered at 8:30 am, and by 9:15 am P.C. Hooft was floating. At 9:30 four tugboats of the company 'Gebroeders Goedkoop' took the ship in tow. The ship now listed only 2.5 degrees. 128 holes above the waterline had been carefully closed. The draught of the ship had been reduced to 15 feet front and 20 feet aft, way less than normal. P.C. Hooft was expected in Ijmuiden at 2:00 pm, from where tugboats from Wijsmuller would tow her overseas to the Meuse. The departure from Amsterdam was a major event with many spectators. At about 11:15 P.C. Hooft passed the Hembrug. Shortly after 2:00 pm P.C. Hooft arrived in IJmuiden, where many had gathered to view the spectacle. The more powerful tugboats from Wijsmuller Hector, Drenthe and Utrecht took over the wreck, and shortly before 3:00 pm it left the IJmuiden locks. The tug Drenthe of 1,300 hp was on starboard, Utrecht of 800 hp on the port side. Hector of 500 hp was connected to the stern so the course of the wreck could be corrected. Stentor, a sister ship of Hector was also involved in getting the ship out to sea. The wreck continuously steered to port, and this required continuous which was very difficult in the confined space between the piers of IJmuiden. At 3:30 pm the convoy left the piers and was on open sea. Here Stentor returned to port. Hector left the stern of the wreck and was connected to Utrecht, so all three tugboats could pull the ship. Drenthe then extended her line to 160 m, Utrecht made hers even somewhat longer. Hector was a few hundred meters before Utrecht. Meanwhile, fog limited sight to only a few hundred meters, and the wreck had two red lights in the foremast advertising her condition. The convoy proceeded at 4 knots an hour while the foghorns sounded. At 8:30 PM it passed Katwijk, and at 9:45 PM Scheveningen. Shortly before 11:00 pm the convoy was before the Nieuwe Waterweg. The plan was to enter the Nieuwe Waterweg at 4:00 am, during the last part of the flow, but this was forbidden by a telegram from Rijkswaterstaat. While before the Nieuwe Waterweg at 9:00 am on the 15th the tugboats Utrecht and Drenthe started to shorten their lines. Meanwhile the tugboat Rozenburg from L. Smit & Co and a tugboat from Rijkswaterstaat arrived. Hector and Rozenburg then connected to the stern of the wreck. At 10 AM the convoy started to steam to the Nieuwe Waterweg, with the wreck having a slightly increased list. It was ebb, but the increased current indeed aided in keeping the wreck under control. At 10:40 the convoy was between the piers. Many tourists had arrived to view the spectacle on shore or from small boats. In Maassluis, home of L. Smit & Co the ship sirens bade a last farewell to P.C. Hooft, and somewhat past 2:30 PM the convoy was before the small harbor of Pernis. Somewhat past 3 PM the wreck hit a stone dam, and got stuck, but was freed by the tugs in a few minutes. The convoy then started to enter the harbor. In the office of Simons Scheepssloperij Mayor I. van Es held a complimentary speech praising the courage of the company in buying the wreck and creating much-needed work during the crisis. Mr. Simons had just thanked the mayor for his kind words, when a young girl entered the office yelling: Father they are taking him away again!. Mr. Simons immediately went outside and discovered that while the ship was entering port, the harbormaster, Mr. Verschoor van Nisse, had made objections, and had ordered the wreck to be anchored somewhat more upstream near buoy 28. When the convoy had almost arrived there, Mr. Simons arrived in a fast boat and ordered the convoy to turn about. He got his way, and so the convoy again steered to the harbor, but now without the pilot, who was in the service of the municipality. At dusk, the convoy entered the harbor again and got stuck at high tide. Now the ship laid still with the bow in the harbor and the stern sticking out into the Nieuwe Maas. The harbormaster wanted to have it towed out again, but Mr. Simons objected, and called in his lawyer and two more tugboats. With the aid of the tugboats Titan and Minerva the wreck was brought somewhat further into the harbor, but by 18:30 the water had fallen further and these attempts had to be suspended. A slightly less sensational version of the events was that the harbormaster had sounded the harbor and had advised beforehand that the wrecks should wait for high tide at buoy 28. The tugs had ignored the advice, but on getting stuck a first time, they had turned about. Then they had made a second attempt on Mr. Simons' orders, leading to the ship getting stuck with 35 m of the stern sticking out into the Nieuwe Maas. In the evening of the 15th the wreck was secured to shore by a wire rope and all tugboats except Drenthe had left. Two hours after high tide the wreck then suddenly started to move on its own and to descend the Nieuwe Maas. The crew on the wreck succeeded in letting the anchor slip out, and Drenthe succeeded in connecting again, but it had traveled some distance before the ship stopped near Vlaardingen. Soon no less than nine tugboats were at work. The first thing that was done was to bring in a floating sheerleg so the anchor could be raised and cut off. The tugboats then had a hard time to keep the wreck under tow when a fierce wind started to grip the wreck. At 3:30 am the ship was almost out of control and two more tugboats were called in. In the morning of 16 December at 4:45 am 11 tugboats (four on the bow and seven on the stern) started the third attempt to bring P.C. Hooft into the breakers' port. Here the wreck succeeded in hitting the burned out hull of Volibilis, which was being broken up at Pernis. After Volubilis had been towed out, the sheerleg reattached the anchor, and so the wreck was secure at anchor in Pernis on 16 December.  A tourist attraction  Now the wreck lay in Pernis alongside Grotius of the SMN, which was also being broken up. In the last phase of her existence, the ship was as a tourist attraction. In the weekend of 17 May hundreds traveled to Pernis, but discovered that they could not enter the ship, because this was too dangerous without some measures. From 23 December the wreck would be open to visitors for two weeks, from 10 in the morning till 4:00 pm, including second Christmas day, but excluding Sundays. The entree fee was 1 guilder, which went to the national crisis committee. The maritime tourist service Spido offered combined tickets for 1,40 guilders. On second Christmas day no less than 1,200 people visited the wreck, and on the first Tuesday and Wednesday it were about 700. The last visits to the ship took place on Saturday 7 January. By then 3,700 people had visited the wreck. The breakers, who had already sold many of the still usable parts of the ship then started the rough work on 9 January. There was a fire on 14 January. This was nothing special during ship breaking.  Analysis of the disaster  In a later analysis, some thought the cause of the fire to have been a spark from a short circuit in the lighting or fans. The reasons why the fire spread so rapidly were many: the chimney effect caused by the open doors, the fans (in the beginning), the ventilation system and the east wind (At 2:45 am firefighters that had entered the stern of the ship closed many doors, and that part of the ship burned much slower), and the high amount of carpentry in a passenger ship that fed the fire. The reason that the fire department could not extinguish the fire was primarily that while it was still limited, the fire department could not reach the fire. Putting water through a port hole generally put a cabin under water, but did not reach the burning core of the ship. On 20 January 1933 a judicial authority, the Maritime Council (Raad voor de Scheepvaart) heard witnesses about the cause of the fire in Amsterdam. One of these was W.J. Muller, an inspector of the SMN. He declared that the fans in the saloons had not been used. The ventilators in the hull were used. This was not done normally, but in this case it was, because the ship needed to visit the drydock before her next trip. He specifically declared that the fans in the music saloon were never used in such a case. Mr. Vader from the decontamination service GGD (municipal health service) declared that the gas used came in cans of Zyklon B, and was not flammable in the concentrations used. The engine room was not gassed. He stated that at noon 8 men remained on deck, and some of these did smoke now and then. At about 6 PM everything had been opened, and nobody remained on deck when the gas was leaving the ship. Mr. Vader thought a short circuit the most likely cause. Mr. Kalt of the port service declared that after he had let the engineer and donkeyman into the engine room, he went through the ship together with electrician Cornelissen and put on some fans. At 8 PM they left the ship again. The administrative officers sent in a letter declaring that multiple had taken place due to the fans in the smoking saloon and in cabins, but that these had been quenched by hand fire extinguishers. Electrician Cornelissen that in the engine room he engaged the dynamo, and the transformer for the ventilation system, so all fans in the holds and thermo tanks were on. Something he checked while he went through the ship with Mr. Kalt. Mr. Buigholt, fourth engineer of the ship was a bit more clear. The central ventilation system and heating had been put on, and when the fire had been discovered he had put it off. Later he went to the engine room to put off the dynamo. One of the owners of Groeneveld en v.d. Poll, who had installed the electricity made some statements about the fans. There were two kinds of fans on board: direct current and alternating current fans. Those in the hold were of the alternating current type. These had three fuses to protect against overcurrent, when these broke at a slightly different time, intense heat could be generated, and a fire could erupt. However, for that to happen the fan had to be near flammable material like wood, and that was not the case on the Hooft. These fans were also not near the place were the fire broke out.  Legacy  MS Georges Philippar was built by the same shipyard which built P.C. Hooft. She was launched in November 1930, and burned and sank on returning from her maiden voyage in May 1932, only a few months before P.C. Hooft was lost. SS L'Atlantique, also built in Saint-Nazaire, was burned in January 1933, a few months after Hooft. The loss of Hooft was such a big disaster that it joined these ships in many disaster overviews.

Waterbury Headquarters The Chase Headquarters Building in Waterbury, Connecticut is on Grand Street across from the city hall. It is now occupied by the city of Waterbury‚Äôs offices. Chase Brass commissioned well-known architect Cass Gilbert to design it in 1916, across from his recently completed Waterbury city hall. Henry Chase, the company president, specifically requested that the headquarters be designed to contrast with the style of the city hall, resulting in a design which shunned colonial marble and brick. The company sold the building to preservationists in 1963 for one dollar, who in turn sold it to the city of Waterbury to be used as city offices, a function it still serves today. It is now known as the Chase Municipal Building and is part of Waterbury's Cass Gilbert Historical District.

Rodney Chase and the company cartoonist, F.G.

Levels of the rivers which have their sources in the Tatras and the Gorce Mountains rose immediately, and on 19 July the flood wave, swollen by excessive waters of the tributaries, appeared on the Vistula near Sandomierz. Due to pressure of the water, levees were broken, and thousands of acres of fields were covered in water. At the same time, this caused the flood wave to decrease, and by the time it reached Warsaw (22 July), it was much smaller than expected, and did not inflict much damage in Poland‚Äôs capital.

This was a landmark bill honoring America's tribal people. This commemorative month aims to provide a platform for Native people in the United States of America to share their culture, traditions, music, crafts, dance, and ways and concepts of life. This gives Native people the opportunity to express to their community, both city, county and state officials their concerns and solutions for building bridges of understanding and friendship in their local area.

Biography Paul Tanner was born in Peoria, Illinois, to Frank J. and Laura Margaret (n√©e McGowan) Tanner. He and his family later moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he attended Marquette University. He began his studies for the priesthood at Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, and continued at St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee. He was ordained for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee on May 30, 1931. He earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology from the Catholic University of America in 1933. Returning to Milwaukee, Tanner served as a chaplain and professor of religion at St. Mary's Provincial Motherhouse and as a curate at Immaculate Conception Church. From 1936 to 1941, he was the Archbishop's secretary for Catholic Action and Catechetics. He then joined the National Catholic Welfare Conference, where he served as assistant director (1941‚Äì1942) and director (1942‚Äì1945) of the Youth Department. He was assistant general secretary of the NCWC from 1945 to 1958, and was raised to the rank of Papal Chamberlain in 1948 and a Domestic Prelate in 1954. From 1958 to 1968, Tanner served as general secretary of the NCWC. In this position, he executed and coordinated the policies set by the body of the nation's Catholic bishops. On October 18, 1965, Tanner was appointed titular Bishop of Lamasba by Pope Paul VI. He was consecrated on the following December 21 by Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, with Archbishops William Edward Cousins and Patrick O'Boyle serving as co- consecrators. He was the first priest to become a bishop while holding the office of general secretary. On February 15, 1968, Paul VI named Tanner as the seventh Bishop of St. Augustine. His installation took place at the Cathedral of St. Augustine on March 27, 1968, a ceremony attended by Archbishops Luigi Raimondi and Coleman Carroll, representatives of the Protestant and Jewish communities, and Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. Following the unexpected death of Pope John Paul I, Tanner reacted with \\"shock and surprise, even horror...It's a reminder that we are just one heartbeat away from eternity.\\" He resigned as Bishop of St. Augustine on April 21, 1979. Tanner later died at All Saints Nursing Home in Jacksonville, aged 89. He is buried at St. Mary Parish Cemetery in Hales Corners, Wisconsin.

In 1975 Forsyth and Uyeda used the inverse theory method to show that, of the many forces likely to be driving plate motion, slab pull was the strongest. Plate motion is partly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at oceanic trenches. This force and slab suction account for almost all of the force driving plate tectonics. The ridge push at rifts contributes only 5 to 10%.Conrad CP, Lithgow-Bertelloni C (2004) Carlson et al. (1983) in Lallemandet al. (2005) defined the slab pull force as: :F_{sp} = K \\\\times \\\\Delta\\\\rho \\\\times L \\\\times \\\\sqrt{A} Where: : K is (gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s2) according to McNutt (1984); : ŒîœÅ = 80 kg/m3 is the mean density difference between the slab and the surrounding asthenosphere; : L is the slab length calculated only for the part above 670 km (the upper/lower mantle boundary); : A is the slab age in Ma at the trench. The slab pull force manifests itself between two extreme forms: * The aseismic back-arc extension as in the Izu‚ÄìBonin‚ÄìMariana Arc. * And as the Aleutian and Chile tectonics with strong earthquakes and back-arc thrusting. Between these two examples there is the evolution of the Farallon Plate: from the huge slab width with the Nevada, the Sevier and Laramide orogenies; the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up and later left as Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates, the Basin and Range Province under extension, with slab break off, smaller slab width, more edges and mantle return flow. Some early models of plate tectonics envisioned the plates riding on top of convection cells like conveyor belts. However, most scientists working today believe that the asthenosphere does not directly cause motion by the friction of such basal forces. The North American Plate is nowhere being subducted, yet it is in motion. Likewise the African, Eurasian and Antarctic Plates. Ridge push is thought responsible for the motion of these plates. The subducting slabs around the Pacific Ring of Fire cool down the Earth and its Core-mantle boundary. Around the African Plate upwelling mantle plumes from the Core-mantle boundary produce rifting including the African and Ethiopian rift valleys.

The queen consort of Louis XV and grandmother of several of his successors was Marie Leszczy≈Ñska (1703-1768). French Revolution and Napoleonic wars Many members of the Polish Szlachta fled to France during the rule of Napoleon when 100,000 Poles tried to throw off Russian rule in Poland early in the 19th century. Many had enlisted to fight in the Grande Arm√©e, like J√≥zef Antoni Poniatowski, Ludwik Mateusz Dembowski Polish commanders of the Napoleonic Wars and Polish legionnaires. Great Emigration (1831-1870) The Polish Library in Paris, founded in 1838, was added in 2003 to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption is the main Polish church of Paris. The so-called Great Emigration was the flood of exiles in the aftermath of the 1831 November Uprising, made up of political elites mainly from the Russian Partition of Poland between 1831‚Äì1870 who settled in France. Potocki Palace in Paris was built in years 1878-1884 Interwar period Another wave of Polish migration, this time in search of manual work, took place between the two World Wars, when they were hired as contract workers to work temporarily in France. After the outbreak of World War II Polish refugees also fled Nazi or Soviet occupation. Polish resistance during the Nazi occupation in France During the Nazi occupation of Poland, a specific Polish Resistance group, Polska Organizacja Walki o Niepodleglosc ‚Äì Organisation Polonaise de Lutte pour l‚ÄôInd√©pendance (POWN), was created on September 6, 1941 by the Polish general consul in Paris, A. Kawalkowski (code name Justyn), and fought alongside the French Resistance. There were also other Polish Resistance movements in France, most notably former soldiers from the Jaroslaw Dabrowski Brigade who had fought in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War went on in their struggle against Fascism in the FTP-MOI. Since 1941 PPS activists in Northern France had also founded two resistance movements, Organisation S and Orzel Bialy (White Eagle). In 1944 Polish Committees for National Liberation (PKWN) were set up to support the Communist Polish army. There were clashes between POWN resistants, under the authority of the London-based Polish government in exile, and the Communist FTP-MOI resistants. French Poles after WWII When the Communists took power in Poland, several thousand French Poles decided to go and live in the \\"Socialist paradise\\", as some Armenians in France moved to the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. There are estimates of 100,000 to 200,000 Poles living in Paris, and many EU program guest workers live in regions of the south, including Arles, Marseille and Perpignan.  From the year 2012  The number of new Poles who migrated to France has multiplied, many are students and traders and other percentage are displaced workers who come from Poland to work in France. Poles are well integrated into French society. The number of new Polish citizens in France amounts to 350,000 in 2012.The Guardian article  Notable Polish French people   18th century  Statue of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, Nancy * Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski (1677-1766) King of Poland, Duke of Lorraine * Maria Leszczy≈Ñska (1703-1768) Polish Princess, queen consort of France  First half of the 19th century  Monument to Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Parc Monceau, Paris * Fr√©d√©ric Chopin (1810-1849) pianist and composer. * Samuel Rosenthal (1837-1902) chess player. * Marie Walewska (1786-1817) noblewoman and mistress of Napoleon I.

During her term, the congregation had financial difficulties stemming from the Panic of 1873. Both prior to and following her time in office, Brown was Directress of the Academy, a women's college run by the Sisters of Providence now known as Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. Early life Born Jane Brown in the small Catholic settlement of North Arm, Edgar County, Illinois, Brown grew up in a religious family under parents Aloysius Brown and Elizabeth Drury. Aloysius, who had moved to North Arm as a Catholic missionary, served as a leader in the town. He was a justice of the peace and also took the community into his home for Sunday prayers when no priest was available. Aloysius also built the church in that town, even teaching himself how to make bricks for the purpose. Later, this brick-making would lead him to do business with the Sisters of Providence and their foundress, Saint Mother Theodore Guerin. These connections led Aloysius to send his daughter Jane to the Sisters of Providence Academy or Institute for Girls (now Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College) when it opened in 1841. Jane forged a strong relationship with Mother Theodore, who taught her math and astronomy. On January 23, 1844, Jane entered the congregation as a Sister of Providence. Mother Theodore gave her the religious name Sister Anastasie. She became a fully professed sister on August 15, 1847. Her first mission was to St. Rose in Vincennes, Indiana in 1847. In January 1849, she with three other sisters opened St. Joseph School in Terre Haute, Indiana. In 1853 she opened the first house at Evansville, and in 1856 she took over as directress at the Academy in Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. As Superior General In 1868, she was elected Superior General of the Sisters of Providence and received the title of Mother Anastasie. However, this election was controversial, as her predecessor Mother Mary Cecilia Bailly was quite offended not to have been re- elected. For a brief time, Mother Mary Cecilia and her supporters spoke of separating and starting a new branch of the Sisters of Providence. Even once this plan had faded, the splintering in the community made governing the congregation difficult. During her second three-year term, Mother Anastasie began work on a hospital in Terre Haute, Indiana. The congregation put many funds and much work into the building and establishment of this hospital. However, anti-Catholic sentiment and lack of support from the community led this project to fail by 1873. Increasing debts plagued the congregation. The Panic of 1873 began a nationwide depression, and the Sisters found themselves thousands of dollars in debt as a result of large-scale building projects and real estate ventures, both prior to and during Mother Anastasie's administration. After administration Mother Anastasie was not re-elected in 1874, and Mother Mary Ephrem Glenn took over as Superior General. Mother Anastasie spent the next seven years working in Lafayette and Madison. In 1881, she returned to her position as Directress of the Academy. A lover of art and culture, Mother Anastasie thrived in this position. She had studied perspective and mechanical drawing with her father Aloysius, and gained instruction in design, drawing from nature and working in painting and watercolor as a student of Sister St. Francis at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. At the Academy, Mother Anastasie instituted the Monday Night Program, where the teachers and students would examine examples of the arts, including drawing, writing, needlework, art, poetry, class work, and musical numbers. Mother Anastasie herself continued as an artist into her old age, creating pencil sketches and paintings, often for use in the sanctuary. She retired to private life in 1896, suffered two strokes, and died at the motherhouse August 10, 1918.

Although Hungarian kings viewed Bosnia as under their sovereignty during this time, Bosnian rulers mostly acted independently in conducting diplomacy, governing the judicial system, granting towns and estates, minting coins, exploiting natural resources, and making trading agreements with other countries and independent cities. King Tvrtko I (r. 1353‚Äì91) acquired portions of western Serbia and most of the Adriatic coast south of the Neretva River. During the late part of his reign, Bosnia briefly became one of the strongest states in the Balkan Peninsula. However, feudal fragmentation remained strong in Bosnia, and after his death the country lost its importance. The Bosnian nobility had significant power, holding meetings at a venue known as Stanak where members deliberated on matters such as election of the new king or queen and coronations, foreign policy, sale or cession of territory, contracting and signing treaties with neighboring countries, and military issues. The Ottoman Empire annexed portions of eastern Bosnia in the 1440s and 1450s and went on to conquer Herzegovina, with the last fortress falling in 1481. Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá, the last king of Bosnia, was captured by the Ottomans and killed in 1463. The population of Bosnia at its height was between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people. The overwhelming majority of the population was rural, with few significant urban centers. Among the more notable towns were Doboj, Jajce, Srebrenik, Srebrenica, Te≈°anj, and Podvisoki. Mining, especially for silver, was a major source of income for Bosnian kings. Background The Banate of Bosnia was a medieval state comprising, at its peak, most of what is today Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as parts of Dalmatia (in Croatia), Serbia, and Montenegro. Although nominally belonging to the Kingdom of Hungary crown lands, it was a de facto independent state. After the reign of Ban Kulin, rulers of Bosnia enjoyed virtual independence from Hungary, and although they held a vassal position for much of this time, they managed to expand their rule in Serbia, Croatia, and Dalmatia. The Banate of Bosnia existed until 1377, when it was elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of Tvrtko I following the death of the last Serbian Emperor from the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, which had no heir to the throne in 1371.  Coronation of Tvrtko  Tvrtko had the strongest claim to the royal title at that time, and even if he had no practical means to rule Serbia, it allowed him to elevate Bosnia to a kingdom, as this would imply more formal independence. Tvrtko thus proclaimed himself the first King of Bosnia, claiming full legitimacy as the crown he took was sent from Pope Honorius III to Stefan the First-Crowned in 1217. A Serbian logothete named Blagoje, having found refuge at Tvrtko's court, attributed to Tvrtko the right to a \\"double crown\\": one for Bosnia, and the other for the Serbian lands of his Nemanjiƒá ancestors. He was also King of Serbia, and in that way, legal basis for crowning was achieved, which was promoted even by his formal sovereign Louis I. Tvrtko's title as a king was also approved by Louis's successor, and Tvrtko's cousin, Mary, Queen of Hungary. Venice and Ragusa consistently referred to Tvrtko as King of Rascia, Ragusa even complaining, in 1378, about Tvrtko's preoccupation with his new kingdom. Tvrtko's coronation as King of Bosnia and Serbia was held in the fall of 1377 (probably 26 October, the feast day of Saint Demetrius), and marked a significant event of Bosnian medieval history, although contemporary sources about the coronation are very rare. The Royal Charter issued to the Ragusan commune on 10 April 1378 stands as one of the key sources for understanding the position of medieval Bosnian banate and its transformation to the kingdom, as well as information about economic activity between Bosnia and Ragusa, and proof of Bosnian independence.  International recognition  As a main trading partner of the Bosnian state, the Ragusa referred to the Bosnian Kingdom as a separate state (\\"rusag\\"), for example in a charter issued to Sandalj Hraniƒá in November 1405, where they articulated that the Ragusan merchants would be safe across the \\"Bosnian rusag\\". Ragusans also paid Saint Demetrius an income of 2000 Ragusan perpera. Ladislaus of Naples acknowledged the territories of the kingdom on 26 August 1406 at the request of Tvrtko II. History Tvrtko's I ascension and reign Golden coin minted during the reign of Tvrtko I Bosnia reached its peak under Tvrtko I, a member of the Kotromaniƒá dynasty, who came to power in 1353. In 1372, Tvrtko formed an alliance with Prince Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá, one of the regional lords in the territory of the disintegrated Serbian Empire. The next year, Tvrtko and Lazar attacked the domain of Nikola Altomanoviƒá, the most powerful Serbian noble at the time. After defeating Altomanoviƒá, they divided his lands, except for his littoral districts of Draƒçevica, Konavle, and Trebinje, which were seized by ƒêuraƒë I Bal≈°iƒá, the Lord of Zeta. Tvrtko received parts of Zahumlje, the upper reaches of the Drina and Lim rivers, and the districts of Onogo≈°t and Gacko. This acquisition included the important Serbian Orthodox monastery of Mile≈°eva, which held the relics of Saint Sava, the first Serbian Archbishop. In 1377, Tvrtko took the littoral districts from Bal≈°iƒá. That year, on 26 October, he was crowned King of \\"Serbia, Bosnia, the Primorje (Seaside), and the western lands\\". The acquisition of Serbian territory, including the important Monastery of Mile≈°eva, prompted Tvrtko into having himself crowned King of Serbia and thus asserting his pretensions to the Serbian throne. This was made possible by the royal Nemanjiƒá line having died out with Uro≈° in 1371. The crown was sent to him by Hungarian king Louis of Anjou. According to a plurality of recent works from scholars like ƒåo≈°koviƒá, Anƒëeliƒá, Lovrenoviƒá, and Filipoviƒá, the ceremony itself was conducted in Mile near Visoko in the church that was built during Stephen II Kotromaniƒá's reign, where he was also buried alongside his uncle Stjepan II.Mile declared as national monument . 2003.Anƒëeliƒá Pavao, Krunidbena i grobna crkva bosanskih vladara u Milima (Arnautoviƒáima) kod Visokog. Glasnik Zemaljskog muzeja XXXIV/1979., Zemaljski muzej Bosne i Hercegovine, Sarajevo, 1980, 183‚Äì247 In contrast, some earlier historiographers, mostly represented by western scholars, consider that he was crowned in the Orthodox Monastery of Mile≈°evaDr. ≈Ωeljko Fajfric: Kotromaniƒái . by the Metropolitan of Mile≈°eva. After the defeat of Altomanoviƒá, Lazar was the most powerful lord on the territory of the former Serbian Empire. He wanted to reunite the Serbian state, and the Serbian Orthodox Church saw him as the best suited to succeed the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. The Church, which was the strongest cohesive force among the Serbs at the time, did not support Tvrtko's aspirations in this regard. By 1390, Tvrtko had expanded his realm to include a part of Croatia and Dalmatia, and expanded his title to \\"King of Serbia, Bosnia, Dalmatia, Croatia and the Littoral\\". Tvrtko's full title listed subject peoples and geographical dependencies, following the Byzantine norm. At the peak of his power, he was \\"King of Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Hum, Usora, Soli, Dalmatia, and Donji Kraji\\". In the last months of his reign, Tvrtko devoted himself to solidifying his position in Dalmatia and to plans for taking Zadar, the only Dalmatian city that had evaded his rule. He offered an extensive alliance to Venice, but it did not suit the republic's interests. Meanwhile, Tvrtko was also fostering relations with Albert III, Duke of Austria. By the late summer of 1390, a marriage was expected to be contracted between the recently widowed King and a member of the Austrian ruling family, the Habsburgs. The Hungarian kingdom remained the focus of Tvrtko's foreign policy, however. Although they did not recognize each other as kings, Tvrtko and Hungarian King Sigismund started negotiating a peace in September. Sigismund was in the weaker position and likely ready to make concessions to Tvrtko when his ambassadors arrived at Tvrtko's court in January 1391. The negotiations were probably never concluded, as Tvrtko died on 10 March. Death of Tvrtko I and decline Queen Helen, who is depicted on its side While Bosnia retained its standing among neighboring states in the immediate aftermath of Tvrtko's death, during Dabi≈°a's reign conditions within the state started deteriorating. He successfully resisted his sovereigns from Hungary, Naples, and even Ottoman Turks. In the first years of his reign, Dabi≈°a successfully maintained the integrity of the Kingdom. The latter part of his reign, however, saw the ascent of magnates and considerable loss of territories and influence. The nobility grew stronger and for the first time acted independently of the king, starting with the Zachlumian Sankoviƒá noble family. Dabi≈°a curbed the Sankoviƒá power, but the trend was irreversible and eventually led to the weakening of the royal authority. Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá, the kingdom's leading magnate, came into agreement with Sigismund and Mary but remained loyal to Dabi≈°a. By June 1394, Dabi≈°a was in open conflict with John Horvat, a fervent supporter of Ladislaus and enemy of Sigismund. He ordered that men from his islands of Braƒç, Hvar, and Korƒçula assist in the siege of Omi≈°, a city ruled by Horvat. Sigismund, who had been amassing an army since April, took advantage of the discord. The Battle of Dobor saw Horvat's defeat and execution as well as the destruction of the eponymous town on the river Bosna by Sigismund's troops. Soon thereafter Dabi≈°a submitted to Sigismund and resigned Croatia and Dalmatia to the Hungarian king and, with the agreement of his vassals, recognized him as his feudal overlord as well as heir designate to the Bosnian throne. It is not clear what prompted Dabi≈°a to agree to such harsh terms. In return, as evident from a treaty issued in July 1394, Sigismund included Dabi≈°a among the highest ranking Hungarian officials and named him isp√°n (count) of Somogy. Despite an auspicious start, Dabi≈°a's reign ended with the kingdom displaying the first signs of decay. Much of Tvrtko's extraordinary legacy was lost in the summer of 1394, and the state resumed its previous boundaries. Dabi≈°a left the state more dependent on Hungarian kings than ever before, and the kingdom's influence in the Balkans waned. In 1394, Dabi≈°a's wife Helen agreed to Dabi≈°a's decision to designate Sigismund as his heir. When Dabi≈°a died on 8 September the following year, however, the leading noblemen - Grand Duke Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá, Prince Pavao Radinoviƒá, Duke Sandalj Hraniƒá, and Juraj Radivojeviƒá - refused to honor the agreement Dabi≈°a had made with Sigismund. Sigismund raised an army and marched to nearby Syrmia to claim the Bosnian throne, but the noblemen convoked a stanak, an assembly of noblemen, and elected Helen as Dabi≈°a's successor. Not willing to engage the united nobility in war, Sigismund withdrew; the death of his wife Mary, heir of Hungary and cousin of Dabi≈°a, made his position too precarious to attack in Bosnia, as did the defeat by the Ottomans at the Battle of Nicopolis. By mid- December 1395, Helen had consolidated her grasp on the throne, and the pretender was killed by Sigismund's supporters in 1396, never having seriously threatened the Queen. The emancipation of Bosnian nobility reached a peak during Helen's reign. Having become virtually autonomous, her vassals engaged in internal warfare, which weakened Bosnia and precluded its participation in regional politics. By March 1398, Bosnia was beset by internal strife. It seems that Helen's family, the Nikoliƒá, attempted to take further advantage of their royal relations and free themselves from subordinacy to the House of Kosaƒça to become immediate vassals of the monarch. This may have been the reason for an uprising against Helen. She maintained a great deal of support in April, when Ragusa paid its tribute to her. The last to remain on her side were the Radivojeviƒá noble family, including Helen's grandson-in-law Juraj. By 10 May, however, her husband's kinsman Ostoja was enthroned as the new King of Bosnia. Ostoja's and Tvrtko's II infighting  Coin of Tvrtko II Ostoja was brought to power by the forces of Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá (Ban of Croatia, Grand Duke of Bosnia, and a Herzog of Split), who deposed Helen in 1398. In 1403 he sided with King Ladislaus of Naples against Sigismund. Ostoja led a war against the Republic of Dubrovnik, a Hungarian vassalage. In 1404, the Bosnian nobles under Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá replaced him with his brother Tvrtko II because of his pro-Hungarian views. He had to flee to Hungary after a stanak in Mile, Visoko. Ostoja tried to reclaim the throne with Hungarian support, but, in June 1404, Tvrtko's supporters defeated a Hungarian army and thus prevented Ostoja from reclaiming the crown, although the chief royal residence of Bobovac and the Usoran town of Srebrenik were captured and restored to Ostoja. All major noble families remained loyal to Tvrtko, while Ostoja functioned as Sigismund's puppet whose territory included little more than Bobovac. The fortress, however, housed the crown, which Tvrtko was not able to reach. Following a few minor disputes with the maritime republics of Venice and Ragusa over Konavli and Pomorje, Tvrtko gained recognition as the legitimate king from both states. By 1406, Ostoja was losing what little support he had left in Bosnia, with the nobility now unanimously favouring Tvrtko, but the former king's decision to remain in the country continued to trouble Tvrtko. Ragusans described the beginning of Tvrtko's reign as more tumultuous than anything \\"since the Flood\\", but he soon succeeded in uniting the country by bringing together his feuding vassals. Hungarian attacks on Bosnia took place annually, making Tvrtko's life \\"a constant hassle\\". In 1408, Sigismund defeated the Bosnian nobility and Tvrtko and in 1409 he restored Ostoja to the throne. One hundred and seventy minor noblemen were captured and killed in Dobor by being tossed over the city walls. Tvrtko is said to have been captured as well, but this does not appear to be true, as he demanded the customary tribute from the Ragusans in February 1409. The hostilities continued until the end of November, with Tvrtko retreating southwards with his noblemen and resisting Hungarian attacks, which enabled Ostoja to reestablish control over Central Bosnia. Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá, depicted in Hrvoje's Missal Tvrtko remained on the throne until mid-1409, when Ostoja prevailed. Sigismund's claim became untenable, but Bosnians acknowledged his overlordship over Ostoja; only Tvrtko refused to submit to the King of Hungary. He appears to have evaded capture by Hungarian troops by fleeing to the mountains of northern Zachlumia. Ostoja ended the decade-long dispute with the Hungarians by recognizing the suzerainty of the Hungarian crown and, in 1412, visiting the Hungarian throne in Buda with the rest of the Bosnian and Serbian nobility including Serbian Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. After that Tvrtko faded into obscurity and had no part in Bosnian affairs for several years.  Second reign of Tvrtko II and rising Ottoman influence  The first Ottoman troops attacked Bosnia in May 1414; in August they also brought the deposed monarch, Tvrtko, and set him up as anti-king. His alliance with the Ottomans may have been due to their mutual hostility towards Sigismund. Pavle Radenoviƒá immediately declared for Tvrtko, but no other major nobleman appears to have followed his example - not even Hrvoje. While Tvrtko hoped for an Ottoman victory, Ostoja expected that a Hungarian triumph would rid him of Ottoman raiders and secure his position against both his rival and his ambitious magnates. The Battle of Doboj in August 1415 saw the disastrous defeat of Sigismund's army. Contrary to expectations, however, the Ottomans recognized Ostoja as the legitimate king. Tvrtko lost his ground, while the united Bosnians for the first time shifted their allegiance from the Hungarian crown to the Ottoman Sultanate. Ostoja died in September 1418. Despite expectations that Tvrtko would take over, Ostoja's son Stephen was elected king. When the Ottomans invaded Bosnia in early 1420, Tvrtko once again accompanied them and installed himself as anti-king. Sandalj immediately declared for him. Fearing the Ottomans, Sandalj's example was soon followed by other noblemen. In June Tvrtko convoked a stanak, and Ragusa recognized him as king. He had the support of almost all of the nobility in Visoko, including duke Vukmir, mayor Dragi≈°a, knez Juraj Vojsaliƒá, knez Pribiƒá, knez Radiƒç Radojeviƒá, knez Batiƒá Mirkoviƒá, knez Juraj Dragiƒçeviƒá, knez Petar Kle≈°iƒá, duke Ivko, and duke Pavao Jurjeviƒá. By the end of the year, Tvrtko had completely ousted Stephen, who continued to advance his claim until the summer of 1421. He appears to have died soon after. Internal troubles forced the Ottomans to withdraw their troops from Bosnia, which enabled Tvrtko to strengthen his hold on the kingdom and for its economy to recover. Tvrtko's second accession had to be legitimized with a new coronation, which took place during a stanak in August 1421. Tvrtko's second reign was marked by his quick resolution to restore royal authority and the king's pre-eminence among Bosnia's feudal rulers. With Hrvoje and Pavle gone, and Sandalj preoccupied by conflict with Pavle's sons, Tvrtko was able to significantly expand the royal domain. In December 1422 Tvrtko signed a beneficial trade treaty with the Republic of Venice and discussed plans for joint military action against Sigismund in Dalmatia. Tvrtko's association with Venice bothered not only Ragusa, but also the Ottoman Turks; the former resented losing their monopoly on trade, while the latter's poor relationship with Venice was the result of territorial disputes over Albania and Zeta. Ottomans proceeded to raid Bosnia in the spring of 1424 to make it clear to Tvrtko that close relations with Venice would not be tolerated. Tvrtko understood that Venice would not be able to provide him with help against the Ottomans, and thus slowly dismantled their alliance. In 1425, Tvrtko realized that he needed a strong ally in the event of further Ottoman attacks. The Ottomans responded with severe attacks that forced Tvrtko to accept their suzerainty and to agree to pay an annual tribute. In 1432, Stefan Lazareviƒá's successor ƒêuraƒë, Sandalj, and the Ottomans helped Radivoj, the elder illegitimate son of the long-deceased Ostoja, to lay claim to the throne and take control of much of the country. Tvrtko's only noteworthy support came from Hrvoje's nephew and successor, Juraj Vojsaliƒá, and he managed to retain only central and northwestern Bosnia. Tvrtko retreated to Visoko, but soon found that Sandalj had become too ill to support Radivoj's cause. After years of pleading for their help, Tvrtko finally saw Hungarians march into Bosnia in mid-1434. They recovered for him Jajce, Hodidjed, Boƒçac and the Komotin Castle, but he lost it all as soon as they retreated. In fact, he himself appears to have left with the troops on their way back to Hungary, as he is known to have resided at the court in Buda in 1435. Radivoj ceased being a threat when he lost Ottoman support that year, while Sandalj's death presented Tvrtko with a new and more vital rebellious vassal in the form of Sandalj's nephew and successor, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça.  Death of Tvrtko II and Thomas's ascension  Thomas succeeded Tvrtko, but his accession was not recognized by the leading magnate of Bosnia, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça. The two engaged in a civil war which ended when Thomas repudiated his wife Vojaƒça and married the insubordinate nobleman's daughter Catherine. Thomas and his second wife, both raised in the Bosnian Church tradition, converted to Roman Catholicism and sponsored the construction of churches and monasteries throughout Bosnia. Throughout his reign, Thomas waged a war with the Serbian Despotate over the lucrative mining town of Srebrenica and its surroundings, in addition to (or in conjunction with) multiple conflicts with his father-in- law. Having failed to expand into Croatia proper, Thomas turned again to the east in 1458, arranging a match between his son Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá and the Serbian heiress Helena. His control over the remnants of the Serbian Despotate lasted merely a month before the Ottoman conquest of the state. Thomas's failure to defend Serbia permanently damaged his reputation in Europe. Wishing to improve his image among Europe's Catholics, Thomas turned against the Bosnian Church, thus becoming the first ruler of Bosnia to engage in religious persecution. =Tvrtko II's death, religious strife and outbreak of civil war= The Kingdom of Bosnia and the Despotate of Serbia in 1422 Radivoj styled himself as King of Bosnia for the remainder of Tvrtko's reign. He was nominally supported by the Ottomans and by Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça. This alliance could have easily deposed Tvrtko II in Radivoj's favor if they wished, but it appears that their only goal was to weaken and divide Bosnia for their own future benefit. Notwithstanding, King Tvrtko II maintained himself on the Bosnian throne longer than any of the monarchs who followed Tvrtko I. He also did more to restore royal dignity and centralize the state than any other, leaving a strong mark on Bosnia's politics, economy, and culture. King Tvrtko II died in September 1443. childless, having expressed a wish to be succeeded by his politically inactive and until then rather obscure cousin Stephen Thomas, Radivoj's younger brother and likewise an illegitimate son of Ostoja. Meanwhile, like most Bosnian nobleman of the era, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá too considered himself a staunch Krstjanin, as the Bosnian Church adherents were known and as its members called themselves. His conspicuous attitude toward Bosnian Church was highlighted when king Tvrtko II died and Stjepan refused to recognize a chosen heir, the deceased king's cousin and recent convert to Roman Catholicism, Thomas, as the new King of Bosnia, thus creating a political crisis which culminated in civil war. Apparently, one of the point of contention was Thomas recent conversion Catholicism, move that was deem potentially harmful to the Bosnian Church. And while Thomas' decision to convert was forced political maneuvering, albeit founded in sound reasoning with the saving of the realm on his mind, he also committed himself to demonstrate his devotion by engaging in religious prosecution against his recent fellow co-religionist, thus eventually proving his conversion to be detrimental to the Kristjani. These developments prompted Stjepan to give followers and members of the Bosnian Church safe haven, and also to join the Ottomans in support of Bosnian anti-King Radivoj, Thomas' exiled brother, who was too Bosnian Church faithful and remained so in face of king's crusade against the church adherents. In 1443, the Papacy sent envoys to Thomas and Stjepan about a counter-offensive against the Ottomans, but the two were in the middle of the civil war. Ivani≈° Pavloviƒá, sent by King Thomas, attacked Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá. Thomas had at the same time been recognized by the Hungarian regent John Hunyadi. Stjepan turned to King Alfonso V of Aragon, who made him \\"Knight of the Virgin\\", but did not give him troops. On 15 February 1444, Stjepan signed a treaty with the King of Aragon and Naples, becoming his vassal in exchange for Alfonso's help against his enemies, namely King Thomas, Duke Ivani≈° Pavloviƒá and the Republic of Venice. In the same treaty Stjepan promised to pay regular tribute to Alfonso instead of paying the Ottoman sultan as he had done until then.Momƒçilo Spremiƒá, Balkanski vazali kralja Alfonsa Aragonskog, Prekinut uspon, Beograd 2005, pp. 355‚Äì358 =Peace through royal marriage= In 1446 Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá finally recognized Thomas as king, and the pre-war borders were restored. Peace between two rivals was sealed by the marriage of Stjepan's daughter Catherine (Katarina) and King Thomas in May 1446, with Catherine abandoning Bosnian Church and converting to Roman Catholicism. The Ottomans were displeased with the peace as their interest lay primarily in weakening and dividing Bosnia. Serbian Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá was also displeased due to the Srebrenica issue, as the principal mining center of Bosnia returned to Bosnia. In 1448, the Ottomans sent an expedition to plunder King Toma≈°'s lands, but they also plundered Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá's lands. Stjepan sent envoys to Despot ƒêuraƒë to try to improve the relations between himself on one side and ƒêuraƒë and Ottomans on the other. =Renewal of conflict= This attempt to \\"bolster his case with the Ottomans\\", led Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá to drop his title Grand Duke of Bosnia in 1448, and assume the new title Duke then Herzog of Hum and the Coast. Later, in 1449, in another public relations stunt, he changed it into Herzog of Saint Sava, after the Serbian saint whose relics were held in Mile≈°eva at the easternmost part of his province. This move had a considerable public relations value for Vukƒçiƒá, since Saint Sava's relics were then, as are now, considered miracle-working objects with healing properties by people of all faiths in the region, but probably more importantly, it signified and attested his alignment with Despot ƒêuraƒë, whose side he took in the ƒêuraƒë's war against king Toma≈° over the rich mining town of Srebrenica. In 1451 Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá attacked the Republic of Ragusa, and laid siege to the city. As he had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, and an annual income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him. along with the promise of hereditary Ragusan noble status which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. The threat seems to have worked, as Stjepan abandoned the siege. After King Thomas and Despot ƒêuraƒë reconciled sometime prior to late fall 1451, Ragusa proposed a league against Stjepan. Thomas' charter from 18 December 1451, apart from ceding of some of Stjepan's territories to Ragusa, who nevertheless firmly held those, also included the obligation that he would attack Vukƒçiƒá. Stjepan Toma≈°eviƒá and Ottoman conquest Stjepan Toma≈°eviƒá, the last Bosnian king, by Jacopo Bellini Stjepan Toma≈°eviƒá succeeded his father on the throne following the latter's death in July 1461 and became the first Bosnian king to receive a crown from the Holy See. Under Toma≈°eviƒá, Bosnia was left to fend for itself by his senior, Matthias Corvinus, who held nominal rule of Bosnia, and by other European powers. After the Ottomans laid siege on Jajce, Toma≈°eviƒá escaped to Kljuƒç, fortress in the western territories of his realm, but Ottomans lead by Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá pursued and caught up with him there. After a four days siege of Kljuƒç and negotiations, Angeloviƒá sent a written assurance to the king, stating that his life will be spared. As it happened king was lured back to Jajce based on empty promise, since he was nevertheless beheaded just behind the capital's citadel, since then named Carevo polje (). Kingdom fell in 1463 and eventually became the westernmost province of the Ottoman Empire. After the fall of Bosnia, queen-mother, Catherine, escaped to Rome on horseback by fooling the Ottomans over which route she wanted to take. She stated that she was leaving the country to see her sons or to visit the Holy See. The rapid conquest of Bosnia, despite its inaccessible mountain fortresses, was unexpected, but many Bosnians were already aware of the impossible situation. If they were to fall, they preferred the Ottomans to the Hungarians, who they saw as an age-long enemies. They offered their kingdom to Venice in return for aid, but when Venice refused, they preferred to remain under the Ottomans than the Hungarians. =Herzegovina emerges= In the south the Duchy of Saint Sava held on until 1481, when his duchy was definitely incorporated into the newly formed and renamed province, Sanjak of Herzegovina. =Jajce banate= The fortified Jajce, the capital of, at that point, all but completely annihilated kingdom, was captured by Hungarians under Matthias on 26 December 1463. Hungarians established a defensive territory between advancing Ottomans and their kingdom further north by constituting the \\"Banate of Jajce\\" along with the Banate of Srebrenik and the Banate of Bihaƒá. In Hungarian hands Jajce withstood Ottoman attacks until 1527, when it finally surrendered after a decisive Ottoman victory in the Battle of Moh√°cs. Much of modern northern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina was then incorporated into the Ottoman Sanjak of Bosnia, initially belonging to the Rumelia Eyalet, when in 1580 Bosnian Sanjak became a core province of the newly established Eyalet of Bosnia. Culture and religion Steƒáak monuments in Radimlja near Stolac Roman Catholic monasteries in Bosnia in the 15th century The territory of Bosnia and today's Herzegovina is littered with medieval gravestones called steƒáak, which first appeared in the middle of the 12th century. They were a tradition among Bosnian, Catholic and Orthodox Church followers alike. While Bosnia had many architecturally impressive stone fortresses, its medieval churches were small, especially compared to Catholic churches along the coast and Orthodox monasteries in neighboring Serbia, possibly because of the indifference of Bosnian nobles towards formal religion. Medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina had three Christian faiths: Catholic and Orthodox Christians, and some who simply called themselves Bosnians, belonging to the so-called Bosnian Church. Most information about this church comes from outside sources and its exact nature is a subject of debate, particularly around its possible dualist teachings. It was accused by the Catholic and Orthodox authorities of heresy and being linked to the Bogomils (Patarenes). The Catholic church was slightly more dominant in towns and in the west and north of Bosnia. The Bosnian Church was present in Donji Kraji and the Drina river valley to some extent, but the majority of population remained Catholic, although most of the population was without priests. When Vukosav Hrvatiniƒá of Donji Kraji pledged allegiance to Stephen II and gained ≈æupa Banica and Vrbanja as a result, Bosnian Church officials were present as a guarantee of charter that confirmed those ≈æupas. The bans and kings of Bosnia were proclaimed Catholics during their reign, except for Ostoja, who showed some interest in the Bosnian Church while he was on the throne. There were, however, several important noblemen who were members of the Bosnian Church, called \\"Krstjani\\", such as Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá, the Radinoviƒá-Pavloviƒá family, Sandalj Hraniƒá, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá, and Paul Kle≈°iƒá. Conversions were sometimes used as a political tool by high-ranking nobles such as Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá of Donji Kraji, who converted to Catholicism to obtain lucrative titles, but when faced with difficult odds in 1413 he openly threatened that he would go back to \\"pagan religion\\", as the Catholic Church viewed the Bosnian Church as a dualist religion. Despite the religious hesitancy of the duke, by his death, the Bosnian Church had lost its foothold in Donji Kraji, since his heirs were increasingly referred to as committed Catholics. At the beginning of 15th century, the withdrawal of representatives of the Bosnian Church from political activities in the service of Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá allowed members of the Catholic Church to take up those seats, as recorded in a document of Juraj Vojsaliƒá dated 12 August 1434. It was common for the Holy See to have Bosnian rulers renounce any relation to the Bosnian Church, or even perform conversions, in return for support. After Stephen Thomas started persecuting Bosnian Church followers, they responded in the traditional stronghold in Visoko and in 1450 demolished the Franciscan monastery in Mile. However, it was quickly rebuilt. Thomas earned the nickname \\"damned king\\" for his actions against adherents of the Bosnian Church.Oki√ß, Les Kristians, 128. Economy King Tvrtko I, statue in Herceg Novi Important mining towns like Fojnica, Kre≈°evo, Olovo, Srebrenica, Dusina, Kamenica, and De≈æevice began to be mentioned in contemporary sources during Tvrtko I's reign. Srebrenica was a very lucrative possession with its silver mines. Caravan trade was frequent between the Republic of Ragusa and Bosnia, and Ragusan merchants had trading colonies in Podvisoki, Fojnica, Srebrenica, Kre≈°evo and others. Economic activity allowed for the creation of new ≈æupas like Nenavi≈°te in Posavina and Trebotiƒá in Podrinje. Via Narenta and Via Drine were economically crucial as they provided access to Drijeva and Dubrovnik, which in turn provided access to the Adriatic Sea. In 1382 Tvrtko built a new fortress in the Bay of Kotor on the Adriatic coast to form the basis of a new salt trading centre. Initially named after Saint Stephen, the city came to be known as Novi (meaning \\"new\\"). Mining was a major industry in Bosnia. Saxons provided engineering expertise, and the mines were often run by Ragusans. Notable among these Saxon engineers was Hans Sasinoviƒá, who together with his brother got the rights for silver mines in Ostru≈ænica and Fojnica.–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª–æ –î–∏–Ω–∏—õ, –ó–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò—É —Ä—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —É —Å—Ä–µ–¥—ö–µ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–Ω–æ—ò –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏ –∏ –ë–æ—Å–Ω–∏, I –¥–µ–æ, –°–ê–ù, –ü–æ—Å–µ–±–Ω–∞ –∏–∑–¥–∞—ö–∞ 240, –û–¥–µ—ô–µ—ö–µ –¥—Ä—É—à—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—É–∫–∞ 14, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1955, 8‚Äì9. Most of the silver mines laid in the king's lands, except from Srebrenica, and there was a demand for Bosnian silver products in the cities on the Adriatic. Germans working in Bosnia produced firearms and cannons, making it one of the first inland Balkan countries to do so. Vlachs in medieval Bosnia carried much of the traffic between inland and coastal cities. With their caravans, led by kramar, mostly composed of 10 to 100 horses, they conducted much of the trade between inland and coastal cities. A particularly large caravan trade happened on 9 August 1428 between Podvisoki and Ragusa, when Vlachs committed to Ragusan lord Tomo Buniƒá that they would deliver 1500 modius of salt on 600 horses.\\"State archive, Ragusa Republic, Series: Diversa Cancellariae, Number: XLV, Foil: 31 verso. At the end of the 14th century, merchants from Podvisoki took part in the slave trade. For example, on November 1389 Bogovac Vukojeviƒá sold the small boy Milko for 4 ducats.State archive Ragusa Republic, Series: Diversa Notariae, Number: X, Foil: 77. In the twilight years of the Kingdom of Bosnia, Thomas engaged in vigorous commerce and made business deals with Dalmatian traders. He relied heavily on his silver mining, but profited most from his salt trade monopolies. Sultan Mehmed started exerting even greater pressure on Bosnia. In addition to financial extortion, Bosnia under Thomas was now forbidden to export silver, which Mehmed claimed for himself, crippling of the Bosnian economy. Thomas's successor Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá tried to improve the situation, and the economy became stronger than ever during his reign, collecting more profit from the flourishing metalworking trade. The most important customs posts were in Drijeva, Vrabaƒç, De≈æevice, Podvisoki, Trebinje, Foƒça, Gora≈æde, Boraƒç, Vi≈°egrad, Olovo, and Srebrenica. Customs collection was overseen by protovestiarios, who were often Ragusan citizens.

Gaining experience Early life Austin was raised in Washington, DC, in a politically active family. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Swarthmore College in 1956, a Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary in 1959, and a Doctor of the Science of Theology from San Francisco Theological Seminary in 1975.http://www.creeksidepress.com/biography.html Dick Austin's biography at Creekside Press. Pastor and teacher Austin served a five-church Presbyterian parish in a rural mining area of Pennsylvania, then served as associate pastor of the Georgetown Presbyterian Church in Washington DC. In 1966, he was appointed Director of the West Virginia Mountain Project, his denomination's largest Appalachian mission, in the Big Coal River Valley of West Virginia. From 1975 until his retirement in 1999, Austin had a special ministry in Environmental Theology with the Presbyterian Church. His base was a mountain farm in southwestern Virginia, near Dungannon. In the 1970s and 1980s, Austin spoke to Protestant, Catholic, Evangelical and Eastern Orthodox groups across the United States, and trained young ministers in environmental awareness through the ecumenical Appalachian Ministries Educational Resource Center in Berea, Kentucky. For this work Austin was honored in 1999 by Wilson College with a Doctor of Humane Letters degree. Advocating Austin based his early books on his experiences among Appalachian people advocating against strip mining for coal. Al Gore wrote about Austin's experiences in Earth in the Balance: Austin led a campaign to abolish strip mining in West Virginia in 1971, then co-chaired the national coalition Citizens to Abolish Strip Mining that lobbied U.S. Congress to pass anti-strip-mining legislation. President Jimmy Carter signed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act in 1977. From 1977 to 1982, Austin turned his attention to a more local issue. American Electric Power planned to build America's largest pumped-storage hydroelectric facility at Brumley Gap in southwestern Virginia. Austin led the Coalition of American Electric Consumers that forced American Electric Power to withdraw its plans. Family Austin is married to Anne Leibig, a gestalt psychotherapist. He has three sons from a previous marriage, and six grandchildren. Writing career Environmental theology Between 1987 and 1990, Austin's four-book series, Environmental Theology, was published by John Knox Press and Creekside Press. Baptized into Wilderness explores the spirituality of John Muir. Beauty of the Lord draws from the American theologian Jonathan Edwards to propose an understanding of beauty that is relational rather than aesthetic, and that strengthens our experiences of God with experiences of nature. Hope for the Land explores Biblical texts that affirm human responsibility to liberate land from oppression. Reclaiming America proposes land reform, civil rights for natural life and new approaches to agriculture.http://www.creeksidepress.com Creekside Press. The author Chris Bolgiano summarized Austin's philosophy in Living in the Appalachian Forest: Moral imagination Austin's second series, Moral Imagination in Industrial Culture, draws upon his family history to explore Christian responses to the challenges of industrialization during the past two centuries.

Overview  OpenCTM is an open source project that has evolved around a technology for compressing 3D triangle meshes. The technology is divided into three different parts: * An open, binary file format. * An open source software library for reading and writing OpenCTM files. * A software tool set for converting and viewing OpenCTM files. The triangle mesh data structure that OpenCTM uses is directly compatible with high performance graphics rendering pipelines, such as OpenGL, which makes is suitable for interactive computer graphics applications. Other application types, such as CAD/CAM tools, usually need to convert the mesh data into a custom mesh format for more efficient data handling. OpenCTM uses a triangle index array to represent the triangle connectivity information, and several arrays for representing vertex data (vertex coordinates, normals, UV coordinates and custom vertex attributes).  File format  The file format, which is binary, uses 32-bit little endian format for all integer fields, and 32-bit binary IEEE 754 format for all floating point fields (also little endian). The file begins with a special integer identifier, 0x4D54434F, which, if interpreted as four ASCII characters, forms the string ‚ÄúOCTM‚Äù. Following the identifier is an integer value that specifies the file format version (the latest official file format version is 5). The rest of the file, which is described in the file format specification,OpenCTM Format Specification, version 5 contains the triangle mesh information. This includes a compressed triangle index array and compressed vertex arrays (one array for each vertex attribute). Due to the many steps of data processing that are required for implementing the compression, interacting with the file format directly is usually more complex than interacting with other, uncompressed triangle mesh file formats (for instance STL and PLY).  Compression  The compression is based on lossless entropy reduction, by means of various differentiation operations, followed by lossless entropy coding using the LZMA compression library.

An optional feature of the R-2000 home program is the EnerGuide rating service. This service is available across Canada, allows home builders and home buyers to measure and rate the performance of their homes, and confirm that those specifications have been met. Some Canadian provinces are considering mandatory use of the service for all new homes. Regional initiatives based on R-2000 include Energy Star for New Homes, Built Green, Novoclimat, GreenHome, Power Smart for New Homes, and GreenHouse.

Established in December 2002, the Canada Green Building Council obtained an exclusive licence in July 2003 from the United States Green Building Council to adapt the LEED rating system to Canadian circumstances. The path for LEED's entry to Canada had already been prepared by BREEAM-Canada, an environmental performance assessment standard released by the Canadian Standards Association in June 1996. The American authors of LEED-NC 1.0 had borrowed heavily from BREEAM-Canada in the outline of their rating system; and in the assignment of credits for performance criteria.

In this book, Crick gives important insights into his work on the DNA structure, along with the Central Dogma of molecular biology and the genetic code, and his later work on neuroscience. Description The main purpose of Crick's book is to describe some of his experiences before and during the \\"classical period\\" of molecular biology from the 1953 discovery of the DNA double helix to the 1966 elucidation of the genetic code. There is a prologue outlining Crick's upbringing, education, and war work on magnetic and acoustic mines, and following World War II his decision on what branch of science to study, using the \\"gossip test\\". (Your interests are revealed by your gossip.) There is also an epilogue that outlines Crick's work after 1966, his move to the Salk Institute with his career transition to neuroscience concentrating on visual consciousness in primates, and some of his conclusions regarding research in theoretical biology, especially with regard to the brain sciences. Crick comments on various aspects of the DNA double helix discovery and gives a qualified endorsement to the 1987 television movie Life Story with Jeff Goldblum as Jim Watson and Tim Pigott-Smith as Francis Crick. There is a clear presentation of the basic ideas of molecular biology with appendices \\"A Brief Outline of Classical Molecular Biology\\" and \\"The Genetic Code.\\" Crick gives some anecdotes and explains some important ideas and insights without too much technical jargon. According to the Nobel prize-winning physicist Philip W. Anderson, the basic goal of experimental science is \\"learning the truth about the world around us. Crick's words are as good a guide to that end as I have seen.\\" \\"This is a book to be read more than once; the beauty of its style masks much hard science and subtle thought. In spite of having heard it many times from others, the story of DNA as told by Crick still makes a marvelous read. A sense of clarity of thought combined with an equally strong sense of commitment and overlaid with the deep power of his thinking runs through the book. One sees that Crick possesses that all-important but dismayingly elusive knack of distinguishing what is significant from what is not. His confidence in the power of structural chemistry to unravel the functioning of biological molecule is unflagging. At the same time, warning signals sound constantly to keep possible evolutionary arbitrariness in mind\\".

After graduating from university he worked in Le Corbusier's atelier in Paris. He rose to the position of studio chief during his seven-year stay in the studio. He formed his own practice on his return to Japan becoming an important member of the modernist movement. In 1959, he collaborated with Le Corbusier on the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo. Early life and formative years Junzo Sakakura was born in Hashima-gun in Gifu Prefecture. In 1923 he entered the Art History Department of Tokyo Imperial University, graduating in 1927.Altherr, (1968) p113 Le Corbusier's Atelier Almost coinciding with Kunio Maekawa's return from Paris,Reynolds (2001) p72 in 1930 Sakakura journeyed to France to enter Le Corbusier's Atelier. He had left Japan at an opportune moment as the economy was in recession with a spiralling increase in political violence.Reynolds (2001) p74 At the behest of Le Corbusier, Sakakura enrolled on a course in architectural construction at college for six months before commencing his apprenticeship.Dodd & Hozumi, (1965) p222 On a daily basis Corbusier would arrive at the atelier and speak with the job architects about the projects. He would sit with the students and do sketches of his thoughts.Loach (1987) p74 As Sakakura became more trusted in the office he rose first to job architect and then chief of the studio. Students would come to him for advice when Corbusier was not about.Dodd & Hozumi, (1965) p222 Ongoing projects in the office that may have influenced Sakakura later in his career include the Villa SavoyeCasa Brutus, April 2009, p83. Timeline and the Swiss pavilion. Paris Exposition, 1937 In 1936 Kishida Hideto (1899‚Äì1966) a Professor at Tokyo University was put in charge of organising a limited entry competition for the design of the Japanese Pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition. Although Kunio Maekawa's design was initially favoured it was eventually dismissed as being too modernist and Maeda Kenjiro's traditionalist design was chosen in its place. However, the French Government insisted that the design being completed with French materials and labour so this led to Sakakura receiving the commission as he had just returned to Japan (from Corbusier's office).Reynolds, (2001), p107. Sakakura returned to France to supervise the project but unexpected site conditions forced him to change the design and he sought Le Corbusier's advice on this. The building comprised a grey walled box on a black piloti with a free formed plan and ramped access and was voted the \\"Grand Prix\\" of the Exposition.Dodd & Hozumi (1965) p222 Coming from a literary background, Sakakura was in some ways hindered by the technological aspects of his aspirations. Although he locked himself away in a Parisian hotel to complete the work on the pavilion later in life he favoured the style of Corbusier's office, entrusting his plans to other architects in the practice.Hamaguchi, (1969) p16 Notable buildings The Museum of Modern Art, Kamakura, 1951 The Museum of Modern Art, Kamakura, 1951 Sakakura won a limited entry competition for the design of the Museum of Modern Art in the grounds of the Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura.

The ground floor storey that faces onto the lake is built with Oya Stone.Japan Architect (2005), p68 International House of Japan, Tokyo, 1955 The International House of Japan, Tokyo, 1955 Sakakura collaborated with his friend Kunio Maekawa and Junz≈ç Yoshimura on this cultural exchange building in Roppongi, Tokyo.

Nonetheless, two 'Draft Helms' movements have led to him winning a number of unsolicited delegates at the convention, placing him second (in a one-horse race) both times. 1976 Republican National Convention 1980 Republican National Convention Footnotes Category:Jesse Helms Helms, Jesse ","title":"Electoral history of Jesse Helms"},{"id":"25025601","text":"thumb The United States National Park Service, often referred to as the USNPS or NPS, is run by the United States Department of Interior and is charged with protecting, preserving, and interpreting the nation's national parks. While the first national park, Yellowstone, was created in 1872, the National Park Service has only existed since 1916. There was no unifying dress for park officials until the United States Army Cavalry took over the protection of the parks in 1886. For nearly a century since it was officially established, the USNPS underwent several major uniform changes, although several items, such as the distinctive campaign hat, are carry-overs from the early days. Eventually, the uniform became the gray shirt and green trousers that can be seen on NPS Rangers today. Early dress: 1872 to 1886 During the early years of national parks (1870s and 1880s), before there was such an organization as the United States National Park Service, there was no specific unifying dress code for employees. The man credited with being the first park ranger, Harry Yount, wore clothing typical of the late 19th century outdoorsmen. Civilian shirts and wide brimmed hats were mixed and matched with a U.S. Army coat, knee boots, and a variety of buckskin items and animal hide trousers. The employees who came after him followed suit, combining old Army uniforms with civilian clothes, making it hard to distinguish who was a guardian and who was not. Military occupation: 1886 to 1916 On August 18, 1886, the U.S. Army Cavalry arrived in the new park system. Sent in to discourage poachers, defend the forests and stop rampant stagecoach robbery, the Cavalry was easily recognizable by their uniforms, unlike the early \\"game keepers\\". The cavalrymen wore riding boots, jodhpurs, and short waist-length tunics of olive drab, which had flat collars. The most distinctive feature was the soldier's \\"campaign hat\\", a stiff, wide-brimmed hat of straw or felt with a medium- sized, cylindrical crown that came to a rounded peak. In modern times, this hat has been popularized by the U.S. Forest Service's Smokey Bear, and NPS employees in the 21st century still wear the distinctive campaign hat (or \\"flat hat\\" as rangers call it) when in Class A uniform, a direct link back to the 19th century. The military also hired civilian scouts, identified by their badges. These circular nickel badges were printed with \\"Yellowstone Park Scout\\" around a five pointed star, strongly resembling the stereotypical western Sheriff's badges. Clothing for these employees probably stayed at the wearer's discretion until 1907, when the Forest Service began having its rangers purchase official dress. The NPS decided to adopt a similar style, and after several years of internal arguments (several parks had already established uniforms, and quite a few people thought uniforms should be voluntary), rangers across the nation were kitted out in identical clothes. By 1911, the Department of the Interior finalized the outfit that would mark employees as park rangers. The flat hat, or campaign hat, was kept by designers, and the breeches and puttees that were worn resembled those of the cavalry officers that still occupied the parks. The biggest difference between the rangers' and the cavalry officers' uniforms was the tunic; the ranger's tunic of 1911 was basically a Norfolk jacket worn without a belt. It had a high collar, no epaulets, only two pockets (as opposed to the traditional four), and did not fit to the wearers form, as the coat had a more rectangular shape to it. The settled color was to be olive drab, since the Forest Service uniform had already used dark green. By 1912, the style was changed and it continued to change regularly for the next several decades. The 1912 uniform was the officially-approved start of the olive drab color, previous uniforms had been the same shade of green that the Forest Service wore. It also marked the start of a separate summer and winter uniform, which was much needed by rangers in the colder parks. The riding breeches, puttees and boots were kept, but the hat was changed to the Alpine style, and the coat was altered from the Norfolk style. It became slightly more fitted, pockets were put back on, and the collar, while still high, turned down. Rangers also wore vests under their coats. The buttons which accompanied this uniform were inscribed with the words \\"National Park Service\\" at the top, even though the organization would not use this name for another four years. The badge now used by the park rangers (possibly in use since 1905, when the Forest Service split away from the Department of the Interior) was a tin or nickel-plated two inch circle. In the center was stamped an eagle surrounded by a decorative rope edge. There were still internal disagreements as to the style and some rangers refused to wear uniforms at all, reasoning that plain clothes were far more effective when dealing with lawbreakers. In 1914, the Department added shirts to the list of items becoming \\"uniform\\" for all officials. Coats once again had four pockets, although many rangers still wore old style uniforms, having paid for the clothes themselves. At this point in time, there were two main types of uniforms, each named after the person who designed the differing details: the West coast rangers generally wore what was called the Daniels uniform, while the East coast rangers dressed in the older Eisner uniform, which was the style started in 1912. The uniform selection would remain the decision of individual parks for another several years; this included civilian clothes in Yellowstone, and military uniforms in Yosemite, until it became illegal in 1916 for anyone outside of the military to wear those particular uniforms. same hat style is worn by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and many state troopers, and even Smokey Bear. Most distinctive aspect of the NPS uniform is its gray and green color, introduced with the Uniform Regulations of 1920. Little has changed since then. Rangers now wear shoes, trousers, and skirts instead of boots and breeches. References Sources *Badges and Insignia.

He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine in 2010.  Influential work  Rosner's work has been influential in a number of international legislative and legal decisions regarding industrial safety and health, health policy and race relations. The 2005 edition of his book, Deadly Dust, co-authored with Gerald Markowitz, was one of the major stimuli of a five-year, international study of mining and health standards through collaboration with the Agence National Francais, the French equivalent of the National Science Foundation. This collaboration brings together experts from countries around the world to discuss the variety of historical factors that have shaped international policies regarding silicosis, a deadly lung disease affecting workers in a host of industries. In its earlier edition, this book led to the bringing together of over 600 public health, industry and governmental experts from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Mining Safety and Health Administration and elsewhere in a National Conference on Silicosis in Washington. This conference led the secretary of Labor to identify silicosis as a disease that should be eliminated in the coming years and the banning of certain dangerous practices in a variety of industries. In addition, he has been a consultant and expert witness in lead poisoning cases, on behalf of the State of Rhode Island in its landmark suit against the lead pigment industry and individual plaintiffs injured by lead from paint on the walls of the nation's housing.

This is due to the fact that the land descends from heights such as Pe√±as de Cervera (Mount Valdosa, 1412 m) and The Mamblas (1372 m) to the border with Palencia. The comarca receives an average of 647 mm of water, which is an appreciable amount for Burgos. Most of its soil is dedicated to the sow of the cereal, consequence of a long process of rupture of great extensions of Pines, oaks, junipers and other species that covered enormous extensions. So it is testified by the comarcal names: Pineda Trasmonte, Pinedillo, Nebreda, Avellanosa, Torrec√≠tores del Enebral, Madrigal del Monte, Madrigalejo del Monte o Villamayor de los Montes. Long ago there was a big vegetal charcoal production.  Communications  Freeways are acceptable: from North to South crosses the national N-I from Madrid to Irun and from west to east the N-622 from Lerma to Palencia. The others comarcal roads are: * BU-101 from Villahoz to Villaquir√°n (A-62) * BU-114 from Quintanilla de la Mata (A-1) to Villafruela * BU-900 from Lerma to Silos * BU-901 from Cuevas de San Clemente (N-234) to Silos * BU-904 from Lerma (A-1) to Covarrubias * BU-905 from Covarrubias to Hortig√ºela (N-234) * BU-910 from Hacinas (N-234) to Caleruega The train connection between Madrid and Burgos is not very useful due to its neglected state.

Over the next couple of days, the disturbance gradually developed before weakening as it made landfall on Southern India on November 7. After the disturbance emerged into the Arabian Sea, it rapidly became more of a concern to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reporting early on November 9 that the disturbance had intensified into a Depression, and designated it as Depression ARB 03 whilst the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Later that day, the JTWC designated the system as Cyclone 04A. During the next day, the Depression turned towards the northeast the IMD reported that it had intensified into a Cyclonic Storm and named it as Phyan. Meteorological history Late on November 4, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that an area of convection had started to deepen around a poorly organized and elongated low level circulation center about 340 km (210 mi), to the southwest of Colombo in Sri Lanka. The low level circulation center was located in a region of upper level divergence which was providing a good channel for outflow, however it was also located in an area of moderate to high levels of vertical wind shear. During the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed whilst moving around a subtropical ridge of pressure before the disturbance moved onshore in India during November 7 and became more marked as it moved out into the warm waters of the Arabian Sea during the next day. Early on November 9, as a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the JTWC; the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that the disturbance had become a depression and designated it as Depression ARB 03 as multiple bands of deep convection had started to consolidate around the now well-defined low-level circulation center. Later on November 9, the JTWC reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical cyclone, designating it as 04A, with wind speeds equivalent to a tropical storm as organized deep convection increased around a consolidating low level circulation center. Early the next day the IMD reported that the depression had intensified into a Deep Depression as convection organized further. The IMD further reported later that day that the deep depression had reached its peak windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph) 3-min sustained, which made it a Cyclonic storm with it being named as Phyan whilst located about 500 km (310miles) to the southwest of Mumbai as it moved into an area of high vertical wind shear. Early on November 11 the JTWC reported that Phyan had reached its peak intensity of 95 km/h (60 mph), before the Cyclone made landfall in Maharashtra between Alibagh and Mumbai later that morning.

Dise√±o del Rancho Rancho Los Coches History The Soberanes family partiarch, Jos√© Maria Soberanes (1753-1803) accompanied the Portola expedition to San Francisco Bay in 1769. Soberanes married Maria Josefa Castro (1759-1822) and received Rancho Buena Vista. His sons Feliciano Soberanes (1788-1868) and Mariano Soberanes (1794-1859) were granted Rancho El Alisal in 1833. Feliciano Soberanes married Maria Antonia Rodriguez (1795-1883) in 1810. He was the grantee of Rancho San Lorenzo in 1841 and Rancho Ex-Mission Soledad in 1845. Feliciano's son Francisco Maria Soberanes (1818-1887), was granted Rancho Sanjon de Santa Rita in 1841. Feliciano's daughter, Maria Josefa Soberanes, was granted the two square league Rancho Los Coches in 1841. In 1839 Maria Josefa Soberanes married William Brunner Richardson, a tailor who had come from Baltimore, Maryland, seven years before. Rancho Los Coches became known as the Richardson Rancho. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican- American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Los Coches was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853,United States.

Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 For six months in 1846-47, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Captain John C. Fr√©mont camped on the Richardson ranch property. This was a major loss for the Richardsons and was the probable reason for the ultimate demise of the Rancho. From 1848 to 1854, the rancho was a stop on the San Juan Bautista-Soledad stage line, and from 1854 to 1868 the Butterfield Overland Stage running between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Like most of the other California Ranchos, Los Coches was already in trouble when the drought of 1860 hit. The property was acquired by David Jacks in a sheriff's sale in 1865.

History  Originally named Penitentiary Hospital and located on what was then known as Blackwell's Island, the first hospital was built in 1832 to serve the prisoners housed at Blackwell's Penitentiary. After the hospital was destroyed by a fire in 1858, architect James Renwick, Jr. designed a new building to be called City Hospital, on which prisoners completed construction in 1861. It served both inmates and New York City's poorer population. In 1870, the hospital was renamed Charity Hospital and a medical superintendent was hired after the quality of care was criticized. In 1877, Charity Hospital opened a school of nursing, the fourth such training institution in the United States. The program of education for nurses encompassed two to three years of training in the care of patients and general hospital cleanliness. At Charity Hospital, nurses treated patients, assisted surgeons, weighed and cared for newborns, and took cooking classes. In 1916, Dr. Orrin Sage Wightman, an internist at the hospital, took a series of photographs of student nurses, which are housed at the New-York Historical Society. The city changed the name of the island to Welfare Island in 1921 to reflect the mission of the institutions located there. Abandonment The prison closed in 1935, and the hospital was closed in 1957, when operations for Charity Hospital and Smallpox Hospital were moved to Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens. The building, designed in the Second Empire style, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The next year, Welfare Island was renamed Roosevelt Island in honor of Franklin D. Roosevelt. By 1986, the hospital was being considered for demolition because its condition had deteriorated so much. The hospital was demolished in 1994. Stones salvaged from the structure were used in paths in the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, which was constructed on the southern tip of the island.

At to the 2006 census, its population was 27,763 in 7,728 families. Rice has been cultivated in this region for many years, where some indigenous cultivars were conventionally bred by farmers. Fuman also produces popular cookies known as koluche. Fuman's koluche is thinner and larger than its brethren in Lahijan. The city is also known for its statues, including the statue of the ancient Iranian goddess Anahita and the statue of the Four Girls. Location Fuman is only 21 kilometres to the west-southwest of Rasht, and 356 kilometres away from the national capital Tehran. It is situated near the foothills of the Talysh Highlands. Fuman is on the road to the historical city of Masuleh and as a result receives a sizeable number of tourists. History From 660 to 760, Fuman functioned as the seat of the ZoroastrianC.E. Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties, (Columbia University Press, 1996), 162; \\"Hence in 758 the caliph undertook the definitive conquest of Tabaristan, successfully drove out Khurshid II and ended the dynasty of the Dabuyids(who, as Zoroastrians, had never accepted Islam..\\". Dabuyid rulers. During the period of the Mongol occupation of Iran, Fuman and Lahijan were among the main towns of Gilan. The local ruler of Fuman at that time, who was reportedly the \\"only Shafi'ite among the rulers of Gilan\\", was able to generate a large amount of revenue through lucrative silk trade. According to Hamdallah Mustawfi (died 1349), Fuman was a large city, and the center of a wealthy region which produced large quantities of \\"wheat, rice and silk\\". Fuman continued to function as the capital of the Bia-pas region (western Gilan) until 1572‚Äì1573, when ruler Jamshid Soltan made Rasht the capital. From the reign of King (Shah) Sultan Husayn (1694‚Äì1722) to Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (1797‚Äì1834), the local rulers of Fuman were involved in a fierce rivalry with the local rulers of neighboring Shaft. John Elton, who had been prominent under Nader Shah (1736‚Äì1747), was killed in 1751 on the order of one of these rulers, Agha Jamal Fumani. In 1805, during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, Fuman was reportedly \\"still a small, open town with about a thousand houses and a very lively market\\". However, the situation changed when Hajji Mohammad Khan abandoned Fuman for Rasht during the early reign of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (1848‚Äì1896). In the subsequent period, Fuman \\"fell into decay\\". According to Grigorii Melgunov, who visited Fuman in 1860, it was little more than a village consisting of just 140 houses surrounding the palace of the local ruler. Fuman has regained importance since the mid-20th century. Demographics The inhabitants of Fuman are mainly Gilaks who speak the Gilaki language, and the Talysh people who speak the Talysh language. The majority of the inhabitants are Shia Muslims, with a minority of Sunnis present in the city. Sports Football is the most popular sport in Fuman, and the city is host to Shahrdari Fuman who play in the Iranian third tier. Gallery Fooman cookie.jpgRenowned thin koluche (cookies) in Fuman.

Originally designed by architect James Renwick Jr., the 100-bed hospital opened in 1856, when the area was known as Blackwell's Island. A century after it opened, the hospital was closed, and the building eventually fell into disrepair. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and designated a New York City Landmark four years later, the only ruin in the city with that designation. After the completion of an ongoing $4.5 million stabilization project, the Smallpox Hospital ruins will be open to the public. Building The hospital is situated at the southern tip of the island, adjacent to Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park. Renwick designed the main building. The south wing, built in 1903-04, was designed by York & Sawyer, while the north wing (1904‚Äì05) was designed by Renwick, Aspinwall & Owen. When completed, it was a three-story, nine-bay U-shaped structure faced in granite veneer in a random ashlar pattern over load-bearing rubble masonry. The central block has a hipped roof, with corbeled crenelated parapets on the projecting sections, with a simple cornice on the non-projecting sections. Crenelated polygonal chimneys rise from the southeast side of the main block. The two wings, which project from the ends of the northwest (front) facade, had mansard roofs. At the center of the front facade is the main entrance. It has a porch open on three sides, oriel window above and projecting corbeled feature above the roofline. A wide pointed arch holds the main entrance. Though designed in the Gothic Revival style, all of the windows on the third floor have pointed arches rather than curves, unusual for that architectural style. The hospital circa 1870 History Hospital and school Despite the availability of the smallpox vaccine, New York City still had large outbreaks of the disease, in part because of the arrival of infected immigrants. Located on the isolated southern tip of the island in an attempt to quarantine patients, the hospital contained a large charity ward in addition to private rooms on the upper floors. In 1875, the hospital closed and became a training center for nurses attached to City Hospital, later renamed Charity Hospital. Renwick designed the building in the Gothic Revival style, and in 1903-1905, two wings with the same architectural theme were added to the school, named the Home for the Nurses and the Maternity and Charity Hospital Training School, to accommodate the growing student base. In deference to the changing use of the island, in 1921 Blackwell's Island was renamed Welfare Island, and many of the structures there fell into disrepair as they became obsolete. In the 1950s, both Charity Hospital and the nurses school were closed, and their operations moved to new buildings in Queens. \\"Renwick Ruin\\" Both buildings fell into disrepair, eventually becoming ruins. In the 1970s, architect Giorgio Cavaglieri inspected them both, making plans to reinforce the walls of the Smallpox Hospital. In 1972, the hospital was added to the National Register of Historic Places, making it New York City's \\"only landmarked ruin.\\" In 1973, Welfare Island was renamed as Roosevelt Island after former President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Often referred to as the Renwick Ruin, the Neo-Gothic ruins have been illuminated nightly since 1995, in a somewhat successful effort to raise funds for stabilizing the structure. However, on December 26, 2007, a section of the north wing collapsed, adding an urgency to preservation plans. On May 28, 2009, ground was broken on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, which includes plans to stabilize the Smallpox Hospital, a memorial to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and a public area. After a $4.5 million stabilization project, the Smallpox Hospital ruins will be open to the public. According to the AIA Guide to New York City, the remains of the Smallpox Hospital have the quality that architectural historian Paul Zucker, in his 1968 book Fascination of Decay, ascribed to ruins in general: \\"[A]n expression of an eerie romantic mood ... a palpable documentation of a period in the past ... something which recalls a specific concept of architectural space and proportion.\\" p.954 The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, in its 1976 report designating the ruins a New York City landmark, speculated that \\"The Smallpox Hospital could easily become the American equivalent of the great Gothic ruins of England, such as the late 13th century Tintern Abbey in Monmouthshire, which has been admired and cherished since the 18th century as a romantic ruin,\\" and described the building as \\"a picturesque ruin, one that could readily serve as the setting for a 19th century Gothic romance.\\" The hospital seen from the west in the East River, with the Citicorp Building in Queens in the background (1996)  In popular culture  In City of Bones, Renwick Smallpox Hospital was used by Valentine Morgenstern and other members of The Circle as a hideout. The hospital contained one of only two portals in New York City, which were both later destroyed. Ruins of a similar hospital feature prominently in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV, set in a fictional city called Liberty City, which is based on New York City. The hospital was taken over by an evil witch and her minions in issues three through five of the Marvel Comics series Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat. The hospital was depicted in the 2002 Marvel Comics movie Spider-Man in the film's climactic scene. The hospital was featured in the 1993 movie, For Love or Money starring Michael J. Fox.

Built in 1892 to serve as a laboratory for City Hospital, it was \\"the first institution in the nation for pathological and bacteriological research\\". The project was funded by the Strecker family. The building was designed by architects Frederick Clarke Withers and Walter Dickson in the Romanesque Revival style with large arched windows to provide plenty of natural lighting and ventilation. On the first floor were an autopsy room and an office, while the floor above housed laboratories where specimens were examined. The cellar was used as a mortuary and for storage. Administrative support was provided by the nearby City Hospital. An additional storey was later built, providing room for the examination of histological samples, a scientific library and a pathology museum. In 1907, the Russell Sage Institute of Pathology took over the running of the lab. In time, this became associated with the Rockefeller University, and work continued at the laboratory until it closed in the 1950s, after which it fell into disrepair. In 1972, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1976 it was designated a New York City landmark. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority decided to use the structure to house a power conversion substation for the subway trains that run through the 53rd Street Tunnel underneath Roosevelt Island. The city faithfully restored the building, and the substation has been active since 2000.

History Ulfeldt's Square in 1748, painting by Johannes Rech J. J. Bruun Gr√•br√∏dretorv (Greyfriars Square) takes its name from a Franciscan friary, which was established at the site in 1238. The friary consisted at its height of a church, a refectory, a great hall which was used on many occasions for important state meetings and meetings of the provincial which governed Franciscan monasteries in Denmark. The friary was dissolved in 1530 but the church tower was a visible part of the city skyline as late as 1596. The huge cellars of the friary became the town jail and eventually the church itself was converted to a prison. In 1621 Christian IV added an orphanage and recommissioned the church as a house of worship, though it was called the \\"Prison Church\\". Gedde's map from 1757 In the middle of the 17th century, Corfitz Ulfeldt built a mansion at the site and the square became known as Ulfeldts Plads (English: Ulfeldt's Square). The mansion was demolished after his impeachment in 1663 and the subsequent confiscation of his property. Instead a pillar of shame was erected in the square to his disgrace, intended for people to spit on when passing it by. At the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 practically all buildings around the square were destroyed. The area was rebuilt, but after the British bombardment of the city during the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 it saw new devastation but was once again rebuilt. The square after the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 Picture of Gr√•br√∏dretorv (then called Ulfeldts Plads) in 1840 In 1841 the square received its current name. A market building with room for 20 butchers' stalls was erected in the square in 1852. It was built in cast iron from Frederiksv√¶rk. The building was removed in 1901. The market building in about 1900 For many years most of the square was occupied by a bunker surrounded by parking spaces. On 7 June 1968 it became car-free as part of first expansion of the pedestrian zone around Str√∏get; a number of air raid shelters left over from World War II were removed, as well as parking places. According to architects Jan Gehl and Lars Gemz√∏e the square was not initially very popular, but gradually became more and more popular, especially among students from the nearby University of Copenhagen. By the 1980s the square \\"was crowded almost beyond capacity throughout the outdoor season,\\" although it has lost some of its popularity in recent years and is a comparably peaceful place now. Description The water feature Cycling the square The square has a somewhat hidden location. Niels Hemmingsensgade connects it in opposite directions to Amagertorv and Skindergade, L√∏vstr√¶de connects it to K√∏bmagergade to the east and Gr√•br√∏drestr√¶de connects it to Klosterstr√¶de to the west. It has a surface area of 3,510 m2. The square is characterized by colorful house fronts and dominated by a large plane tree. There is also a fountain in granite, designed by S√∏ren Georg Jensen and inaugurated in 1971. The square is lined by a number of restaurants with out-door service and is a popular venue for small out-door concerts, particularly during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. Notable buildings and residents The buildings on the south side of the square were built in the years after the fire of 1728. No. 8 is the former home of the German Sankt Petri Schule which is now located in Larslejsstr√¶de. The houses on the west side of the square were built after the British bombardment.

It is a Tudor Revival structure dating to the early 1920s, housing a congregation restarted in the early 20th century. The church building was designed by Hobart Upjohn, third in the family of American architects by that name. The original parish house, moved from its location along with most of Katonah in the late 19th century, has been demolished, but the church itself remains intact. In 2001 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Building The church is located on a small triangular lot between Bedford Road and Katonah Avenue at the southern end of the village's downtown. It is just outside the Katonah Village Historic District. Next to the church is its parish house, not included in the Register listing. Mature trees shade the building on the south and west, centered around a large spruce tree at the road junction that serves as Katonah's community Christmas tree each year. The building itself is a one- story structure on a stone foundation that rises to the roofline of a small gabled portico over the main entrance on the east (front) elevation. Above that it is faced in painted stucco with the exposed vertical half-timbers of the Tudor Revival architectural style. The steeply pitched gabled roof is shingled in slate. A copper steeple rises from the intersection of the nave and chancel. A large three-part window is located above the main entrance. It is filled with original stained glass and Gothic tracery. Another stained glass window is located in the northwest corner of the nave. Inside the church, exposed timber arches rise from the floor on the side aisles to the ceiling's exposed wooden decking. The white plaster walls have a continuous dark wooden dado at the window sill level. The simple stained wooden pews are arranged in rows with center and side aisles. A storage area is located in the loft above the sacristy, and the partial basement holds the boiler and other utility-related equipment. History Episcopalians in Katonah were organized in 1855 as St. Mark's, under the pastoral care of St. Matthew's Church in nearby Bedford. After 1887, that congregation was disbanded. The following year John Jay II, grandson of the first Chief Justice of the United States, left $500 in his will to start another Episcopal parish. Efforts to do so were disrupted in 1895 when the village moved from its original site to make way for the construction of Muscoot Reservoir. The congregation was finally renewed in 1916, meeting in a movie theater and later a warehouse. Five years later the members asked St. Mark's of Mount Kisco to adopt them as a mission, and raised the money to buy the land and commission a design from Upjohn. Upjohn, the son of Richard M. Upjohn and grandson of Richard Upjohn, both designers of well-known churches in their careers, produced an exemplary Tudor Revival church. It is atypical of most of his other work, except for the English Gothic-style Mead Memorial Chapel in nearby Waccabuc. The exposed timber arches on the interior complement the half-timbers on the outside, and minimal decoration augments the heavy wood. The cornerstone was laid in October 1921. Roughly two years later, the first services were held. It was formally dedicated shortly before Christmas 1923. The church remained under the care of St. Mark's until 1944, when it became an organized mission of the Episocpal Diocese of New York. Fourteen years later, in 1958, it became self- supporting. The next year it bought the current parish house, two doors down Katonah Avenue, from a neighbor, and then demolished the former Parish House, which had been brought to the current village from the former site, in 1961. There have been no alterations to the church property since. The church today The church holds regular Sunday services and major holy days, as well as providing Christian education for children and adults. The choir is led by noted choral conductor Harold Rosenbaum. On Mother's Day weekend each year, the church holds a plant sale to raise money, 10% of which is donated to outreach See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in northern Westchester County, New York References External links *Church website.

The building is a good example of Neo-Italian Renaissance commercial style and represents an important aspect in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century history of New Rochelle. John New & Son, the New Rochelle builder responsible for its construction, is credited with its design. and Accompanying four photos, exterior, from 1983 The Pioneer Building is considered significant, partly because other historic buildings that once surrounded it have been demolished and replaced by newer construction. It was added to the Westchester County Inventory of Historic Places on January 5, 1988, to the New York State Register of Historic Places on November 23, 1983, and to the National Register of Historic Places on December 29, 1983.Westchester County Inventory of Historic Sites Rochelle Westchester Historical Society ‚Äì Historic Properties Listing, New Rochelle History In 1892 Henry Sweet, editor and publisher of the ‚Äò‚ÄôNew Rochelle Pioneer‚Äô‚Äô, felt that the newspaper‚Äô deserved a home of its own. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Pioneer‚Äô‚Äô had been founded in 1860 by an exiled Irish writer named William Dyott. Originally one of several of New Rochelle‚Äôs weeklies, it had grown and prospered enough by 1885 to become the community‚Äôs first daily. It had always been published in rented offices, however, and sweet decided to erect a new building on Lawton Street to serve as its headquarters.Library of Congress ‚Äì About this Newspaper: The New Rochelle Pioneer The paper was published in the building until 1920 when it was forced to close due to increasing competition. From that point onward, the building held a variety of tenants but generally declined. Lawton Street, between Huguenot and Main Streets, was a fully occupied block of commercial buildings through much of the 20th Century. In the 1970s, much of the block was leveled to make way for the New Rochelle Public Library. The Pioneer building remained, but in isolation, no longer related to its former setting. In the late 1970s, the building was vacant and was considered a candidate for demolition. Sylvia Schur acquired the building from the city of New Rochelle to house her business, Creative Food Services, and undertook an extensive restoration project that was completed in 1981. Architecture The two-story, four-bay building, is set on a long and narrow rectangular lot, surrounded by parking lots on three sides. It was never intended to stand alone, but rather, to be part of a streetscape of similar structures. Consequently its side walls are plain, and only the front facade has any true detail or ornament. The front fa√ßade is decorated in the Italianate style, covered in a high quality buff-colored iron spot Roman brick. There are two cornices, one of copper and the other of metal with the ‚ÄòPioneer‚Äô name set in bold relief. The first floor is composed of two storefronts with central entryways each flanked by large bay windows. The unadorned side elevations are covered with painted brick, with a trompe-l‚Äôoeil mural painted on the west side. A separate entrance along the building's east side provides access to the second floor. The rear of the building drops down to one story. Two chimneys project from the west side roof. The most intact sections of the building's interior are found in the two first floor storefronts and east side entrance hall. These areas retain original finishes, door and window trim, some wood wainscoting, and decorated pressed-metal ceilings.NRHP Registration form ‚Äì The Pioneer BuildingNRHP Photographs‚Äì The Pioneer Building References External links * National Register of Historic Places * \\"About Westchester\\" by Lynn Ames.

He is board certified in emergency medicine, internal medicine and critical care medicine. Rivers has published extensive work in the field of shock, sepsis and resuscitation. Education and career Emanuel Rivers is Vice Chairman and Director of Research for the Department of Emergency Medicine. He is a Senior Staff Attending Physician in the Surgical Critical Care Unit and the Emergency Department at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. He received his Bachelor of Science, Master of Public Health, and Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He completed a residency in emergency and internal medicine at Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, followed by a fellowship in critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, PA. He is Board certified in Critical Care Medicine, Emergency Medicine and Internal Medicine. He also has a special competency in Hyperbaric Medicine. Rivers is a national or international research award recipient from the Society of Academic Emergency Medicine (2010), American College of Emergency Physicians (2005), Society of Academic Emergency Medicine (2000), American College of Chest Physicians (2000), Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Critical Care Medicine Research Award (2000). He is a fellow of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, American College of Chest Physicians and long standing member of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. He was the first physician in the history of Henry Ford Hospital to be inducted into the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences in 2005 and has been called to serve on task forces to advise the United States government on health care issues. He was voted one of the Top Docs in the city of Detroit for the years 2006 to 2010. He is also a quality consultant to 3 of the top ten health care delivery systems in the United States. Rivers' practice and research are based out of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI. Rivers' interests include the examination and treatment of critical illness or the critically ill in the earliest stages of hospital presentation, which includes the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit. Diseases, which are included in this area, are patients presenting with shock of all kinds (septic or severe infection, trauma or hemorrhage, heart attacks, blood clots to the lung and other shock states such as cardiac arrest). He is examining new ways to improve upon early detection and aggressive treatment of these diseases, which cost many lives and consume tremendous health care resources. He is further interested in evaluating the number of patients who can be saved at this stage and how well we are treating these patients as well as the epidemiology and outcome evaluation of early critical illness. Contributions The algorithm of emergent resuscitation in the setting of severe sepsis and/or septic shock has been formally conceptualized by Emanuel Rivers in a landmark paper in November 2001 using early goal directed therapy (EGDT) in the emergency department. EGDT has been used and validated for years in the intensive care unit, but Rivers's paper expanded the idea to incorporate all those initially presenting to the ED with signs of severe sepsis or septic shock. Many hospitals across the United States such as Kaiser and Catholic Health Care West have rapidly incorporated the protocol developed by Rivers in their ED treatment algorithms, as well as use it as a quality improvement data point. EGDT has also been cited by the Joint Commission of Hospital Accreditation as a quality improvement initiative for the last two years. Discussion The EGDT study is a reflection of expert opinion for sepsis management by the American College of Critical Care Medicine. His Early Goal Directed Therapy recommendations have been replicated in over 33 publications since 2001 comprising over 8,000 patients with equal efficacy and improvement in health care costs. Three recent multi center trials (ProCESS investigators, ARISE investigators, and ProMISe investigators) published in the New England Journal of Medicine compared EGDT versus other protocol-directed care versus standard care. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of mortality. However, the authors of these trials conclude that this is because Rivers' 2001 study was so well known that it improved the level of standard care such that it is similar to EGDT. Evidence-based medicine experts have argued that these three trials reaffirm the principles of early recognition of sepsis, early broad-spectrum antibiotic use and intravenous fluid resuscitation. The invasive monitoring involved in EGDT is probably unnecessary. In 2014 the ProCESS study was published. Process enrolled 1,341 patients, of whom 439 were randomly assigned to protocol-based EGDT (Rivers EGDT), 446 to protocol-based standard therapy, and 456 to usual care. There was no significant difference in 90-day and 1-year mortality between groups. However, in the sickest sub- group of patients (those with a baseline lactate >5.3 mmol/L) the mortality was significantly higher in the EGDT group as compared to usual care (38.2 vs. 26.4; p = 0.05). ProCESS has now clearly established that EGDT should be abandoned.
