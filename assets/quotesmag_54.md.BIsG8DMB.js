The lake is named after the ancient Sastha temple (a pilgrimage centre) located on its bank. It meets the drinking water needs of half million people of the Quilon district and also provides fishing resources. The purity of the lake water for drinking use is attributed to the presence of large population of larva called cavaborus that consumes bacteria in the lake water. The lake is a designated wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention since November 2002.  Access  The lake is located at a distance of 25 km from Quilon city, which is on the northern side of Ashtamudi Lake. Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, at 105 km, is the nearest airport to Kollam. Karunagapally, at a distance of 8 km, is the closest town to the lake. A ferry service across the lake transports people between West Kallada and Sasthamkotta. Topography and geology  Except for an earthen embankment of 1.5 km length which separates the lake from the paddy fields on its southern side, bordering the alluvial plains of the Kallada River, all other sides of the lake are surrounded by hills which are steep and form narrow valleys. In the south and southwestern parts of the lake there are a number of smaller water bodies and waterlogged areas. The present area of the lake is 375 ha since large part of the lake is reported to have been occupied for agriculture. Rock formation of mainly archaean origin are recorded with intrusions of charnockite, biotite gneiss and dolerite dyke rocks. The Tertiary Varkala formations are observed along the coastal beds. In the valley portion, sand and silt deposits are recorded. Geomorphological divisions of the basin area of the lake comprise a) the undulating uplands which have fairly thick vegetation of mixed crops and plantations, b) the valley fills of laterite alluvium and colluvial deposits with low level areas which are intensely cultivated and thickly populated and c) the flood plains/alluvial plains of the Kallada River on the south that are mostly cultivated. Hydrology  There are no visible tributaries feeding the lake but springs at the bottom of the lake are stated to be one of the source which supply water throughout the year; volume of water in the lake is estimated to be of the order of 22.4 million cum. A thick 10-20 m mantle of kaolinite rich (derivative of laterite) soil around the lake is stated to check flow into the lake and the theory is now that the lake is also rain fed; the lake water level is recorded to be higher at the end of the monsoon season. The average annual rainfall in the area is 2398 mm and mean annual temperature varies between 26.7 ¬∞C and 29.16 ¬∞C. Ground water table in the area is reported at depth of 3.89 m. After accounting for estimated evaporation loss of 5 MCM (million cubic metres) and water utilized for domestic use of 8 MCM (at a pumpage rate of 22 MLD), the two together account for about two-thirds of the inflow.  Water quality  The lake water is reported to be free of common salt or other minerals and metals. The quality for surface water, interstitial water and sediments studied by World Wildlife Fund (WWF), India are briefly as noted below. Quality for surface water (average values): * Surface water: pH 7.25; EC 63.00 Millimhos/cm; PO4 ‚Äì P 4.93 Micro gm. / l ; Ca 7.01Micro gm. / l; Na 4.33 Micro gm. / l; Fe 41.57 Micro gm. / l and Mn 12.11 Micro gm. / l. * Interstitial water: pH 7.20; PO4 ‚Äì P 1.11 Micro gm. / l; Fe 59.1Micro gm. / l and Mn49.00 Micro gm. / l * Sediments: Organic C 8.95%; PO4 ‚Äì P 1690.00 Micro gm. / l; Fe 17724.27 Micro gm. / l and Mn 86.36 Micro gm. /l Water quality test results indicate that the lake water conforms to standards of drinking water prescribed by regulatory bodies.  Flora  Eastern shore of the lake has the insectivorous plant Drosera Sp. Vegetation is negligible and rooted plants and floating plants are unimportant and insignificant. The crops grown on the banks of the lake, apart from paddy, are the plantation crops such as cashewnut, tapioca and plantain.  Aqua fauna  The aqua fauna noted in the lake are: * 27 species of freshwater fishes include pearl spot (Etroplus suratensis) and catfish, two genera of prawns, 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae * Common fish such as Calichrous bimaculatus and Wallago attu These varieties of fish generally have whisker-like barbells set around their mouths. The common teal or dabbling duck is the smallest migratory bird found in the lake. Some of the vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered species reported by WWF in the lake area are: * Critically endangered: Puntius ticto punctatus (Day) * Endangered: Horabagrus brachysoma (Gunther) * Vulnerable: Parambassis thomassi (Day)  Fauna Resident troupes of monkeys are sighted on the banks in large numbers, which are part of the Sasthamkotta temple environment on the bank of the lake. 13 species of insects have also been identified; 9 are butterflies, 2 odonates and 2 hymenopterans.  Deterioration in lake environment  The quality of the lake environment is affected by the following factors. * Increasing anthropogenic pressure * Encroachment on parts of the lake for agriculture * Cultivation of tapioca has increased the soil loss by erosion and runoff into the lake basin * Domestic and agrochemical wastes from surrounding areas disposed into the lake * Soil erosion of the banks from the encroached land * Effluents from domestic sewage * Reduction of ground water recharge to the lake due to increase in agriculture in the area around the lake. * Soaking of dry leaves of coconut palm before matting, which are then used for thatching huts Conservation and management The Kerala State Government prepared a Conservation and Management Action Plan (MAP) in 1999 for the lake's sustainable utilization and conservation and to address the threats faced by the lake. Financial support was sought from the Central Government under the National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) for implementation of MAP based on the specific problems identified in the wetland. The MAP envisages the following activities: * Agro-forestry in the catchment, * sanitation and drainage, * pollution abatement, * limited desilting, * weed control, * conservation of flora and fauna, * fishery development, and * awareness campaigns among the local inhabitants. The above activities were planned to be implemented through the Kerala Water Authority (KWA), Department of Forests and Wild Life, Department of Fisheries, State Fisheries Resource Management Society (FIRMA), District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), CWRDM, etc. Kerala State Council for Science Technology and Environment of Govt. of Kerala provided the support and overall supervision.

Angiopoietins are proteins with important roles in vascular development and angiogenesis. All angiopoietins bind with similar affinity to an endothelial cell-specific tyrosine-protein kinase receptor. The protein encoded by this gene is a secreted glycoprotein that activates the receptor by inducing its tyrosine phosphorylation. It plays a critical role in mediating reciprocal interactions between the endothelium and surrounding matrix and mesenchyme. The protein also contributes to blood vessel maturation and stability, and may be involved in early development of the heart. During pregnancy, angiopoietins act complementary to the VEGF system and contribute to endothelial cell survival and the remodeling of vessels. Few studies have examined the role of angiopoietins in human pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). A knockout model of ANGPT1 was introduced in mice embryos. Results showed that embryos began to appear abnormal by day 11 and were dead by day 12.5 of pregnancy. The embryos showed prominent defects in endocardial and myocardial development as well as a less complex vascular network. Kappou D, Sifakis S, Konstantinidou A, et al. Role of angiopoietin/Tie system in pregnancy.Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine. 2015; 9(4): 1091-1096. Interactions Angiopoietin 1 has been shown to interact with TEK tyrosine kinase.  Placental Malaria  Recently, studies in malaria-endemic areas suggest that placental malaria (PM) may be associated with a dysregulation in angiopoietins. Increased levels of angiopoietin-1 appear to be associated with a decrease in placental weight and placental barrier thickness in women infected with Plasmodium (the causative agent of malaria). In a mouse model of PM, Plasmodium infection of pregnant mice led to decreased angiopoietin-1, increased angiopoietin-2, and an elevated ratio of angiopoietin-2/angiopoietin-1 in the placenta. This suggests that angiopoietin levels could be clinically significant biomarkers to identify mothers infected with PM.

He took part in the Battle of Borodino, the largest and bloodiest single-day battle of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than a quarter of a million soldiers. Prince Gagarin also owned several businesses throughout Russia and Europe. In 1819, Prince Gagarin married Maria Alexeeva Bobrinsky (Bobrinkaya), granddaughter of Catherine II of Russia and Prince Gregory Orlov. On October 16, 1833, Gagarin was appointed a post of vice-president of the His Majesty's Cabinet under Emperor Nicholas I and Chairman Viktor Kochubey; in December 1837, he was appointed member of the commission for the restoration of the Winter Palace after a fire. During service as vice-president, he was the recipient of several distinctions: the Order of Saint Stanislaus 1st class (1834), the Order of St. Anna 1st class (1835), the Order of St. Vladimir 2nd class (1839) and the Order of the White Eagle (1841). Prince Gagarin died a violent death by the hand of one of his former subordinates, a forest warden of the Rejnmana estate. Prince Gagarin met the forest warden at Rejnmana, and, after a brief conversation, was fatally shot in the neck. Despite medical aid, the prince died in minutes. Rejnman explained that he killed Gagarin because he had been exposed to oppression and had lost his rank. However, according to his contemporaries' testimonies, Gagarin had been a humane employer. Nikolai Sergeevich Gagarin's descendants were forced into exile during the Russian Revolution and lived in France until recently. Parts of the Gagarin family now live in the United States.

He previously served as the Director General of Al Jazeera Media Network. He has been ranked by Foreign Policy Magazine in 2011 as the first in The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers, and in Fast Company as the first in the 100 Most Creative People in Business (2011) and as one of the most ‚ÄòPowerful People in the World‚Äô by Forbes magazine (2009)., in 2008 World Economic Forum named Khanfar as one of the 'Young Global Leaders'. During his tenure Al Jazeera went from a single channel to a media network with multiple properties including the Al Jazeera Arabic channel, Al Jazeera English, Al Jazeera Documentary, Al Jazeera Sport, Al Jazeera's news websites, the Al Jazeera Media Training and Development Center, the Al Jazeera Center for Studies, Al Jazeera Mubasher (Live), and Al Jazeera Mobile. On 20 September 2011, he stepped down as the head of Al Jazeera Network. Early years and education Wadah was born in the Palestinian town of Rama in 1968 to the Khanfar family of Yemenite origin. He obtained a bachelor of science degree in engineering at the University of Jordan in 1990 and went on to complete a post-graduate degree in philosophy, a diploma in African Studies from Sudan International University and an Honors Degree in International Politics. During this time, Khanfar started a student's union that soon spread to several other universities and an inter-university dialogue group among students constituted from a range of political backgrounds. By 1989, the student's union was playing an active role in debating the future of the democratic process, and Khanfar started making a name for himself as a charismatic and natural leader, helping to organize forums, protests, festivals and demonstrations for student rights. Journalism=Africa= When Al Jazeera was established in 1996, Khanfar was a graduate student in International Politics and African Studies in South Africa, and a researcher and consultant in Middle Eastern economics and political affairs. He was asked by the channel to provide an analysis on African affairs, which led to him becoming a correspondent in South Africa until 2001. At a conference in Pretoria on 27‚Äì29 August 2012, Khanfar said that he had learned about both political struggle and reconciliation during his years in South Africa. =Afghanistan= In 2001 and 2002, Khanfar reported on Afghanistan from New Delhi. Al Jazeera was unable to get its own correspondent back into the northern territories controlled by the Northern Alliance on the eve of the war, so New Delhi was used, India having a strong Northern Alliance diplomatic presence. As the Taliban regime was collapsing, Al Jazeera's presence in Kabul was threatened by problems including US fire, and concerns from journalists and diplomats that the then bureau chief and correspondent, Tayseer Allouni had become compromised as a partisan of the Taliban cause. Khanfar was brought in to replace Allouni as Kabul bureau chief and restored working relations with the new authorities. =Iraq= During the Iraq war, Khanfar reported from Kurdish-controlled territory in the north, and after the fall of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime, he became Al Jazeera bureau chief in Baghdad. At this time the channel was widely perceived as playing to popular pro-Baathist and anti-Coalition Arab sentiment, despite being represented at the Coalition's Central Headquarters and having an Al Jazeera correspondent embedded within coalition forces. The then US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and then Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz publicly criticized Al Jazeera, Rumsfeld calling the channel's reporting \\"vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable...\\", while Wolfowitz claimed the station was \\"inciting violence\\" and \\"endangering the lives of American troops\\" in Iraq. This public criticism came amid attacks on Al Jazeera from US forces, including the shelling of a hotel in Basra on 8 April 2003 used solely by the channel's correspondents. Nearly a week later, US forces bombed the station's Baghdad offices wounding one cameraman and killing a correspondent, Tariq Ayoub on the same day that two Reuters journalists were killed when a US tank shell struck their office in the Palestine Hotel. In July, Khanfar wrote an open letter to Paul Bremer, the US proconsul in Iraq responding to his assertion that television stations or newspapers guilty of \\"incitement to violence\\" would be shut down. Khanfar wrote that his offices and staff had been subject to \\"strafing by gunfire, death threats, confiscation of news material, and multiple detentions and arrests, all carried out by US soldiers\\", asserting that the channel's coverage had been consistently harassed for unfavourable reporting during the Ba'athist regime. He also said that because Al Jazeera at that time was only available in Arabic, reliance on the channel's coverage came \\"from second-, third- and fourth-hand sources ‚Äì half-truths and total falsehoods that make the rounds in Washington, Baghdad and elsewhere.\\" Al Jazeera executive Khanfar became Managing Director of the Al Jazeera Channel in 2003 and Director General of the Al Jazeera Network in 2006. He spoke at the 2011 TED Conference on the ongoing Arab Spring.TED.com (2011). Wadah Khanfar: A historic moment in the Arab world. Retrieved 1 May 2011. On 20 September 2011, Khanfar announced on his official Twitter page that he was 'moving on' from Al Jazeera after leading the channel for 8 years. =WikiLeaks= In September 2011, the non-profit whistleblowing website WikiLeaks released a cache of leaked diplomatic cables highlighting U.S. activities overseas. Several of the cables implicated Khanfar in unduly influencing Al Jazeera's news coverage of the War in Iraq at the behest of U.S. embassy officials in Qatar. In one instance, the cables suggested that Khanfar removed images of wounded Iraqi civilians from an Al Jazeera report following pressure by the U.S. embassy. They also suggested that Khanfar was anxious to keep his behind-the-scenes collaboration secret.After Disclosures by WikiLeaks, Al Jazeera Replaces Its Top News Director, The New York Times, 20 September 2011 =Resignation= In September 2011, Khanfar announced to his staff and publicly on the micro- blogging platform Twitter that he would be resigning. In an emotional farewell to Al Jazeera staff he cites that the decision had been in his mind for sometime and that the target of establishing Al Jazeera as a global media leader has been met. This is also the theme of an interview broadcast on Al Jazeera where he addresses and refutes suggestions that Wikileaks and pressure from USA may have influenced his resignation. He is succeeded by Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani. Criticism Wadah Khanfar was accused by some of a pro- Islamist bias.Ferjani, Riadh, Middle East Journal of Culture and Communication, Volume 3, Number 1, 2010, pp. 82-100(19). p. 89 Responding to these accusations in a 2007 interview with The Nation, Khanfar said: \\"Islam is more of a factor now in the influential political and social spheres of the Arab world, and the network‚Äôs coverage reflects that. Maybe you have more Islamic voices [on the network] because of the political reality on the ground.\\" In June 2007, Hafez Al-Mirazi, Al-Jazeera's Washington bureau chief, denounced what he saw as the station's \\"Islamist drift\\", and singled out Khanfar in particular, saying: \\"From the first day of the Wadah Khanfar era, there was a dramatic change, especially because of him selecting assistants who are hardline Islamists.\\" During the Iraq War, Al Jazeera broadcast a report that American troops had raided Najaf and detained the religious leaders of the Shia Islamic community, which turned out to be false. Khanfar defended the blunder as an honest mistake.Culture wars: the Arabic music video controversy\\", American Univ in Cairo Press, 2005, (p. 126) Al Udeid Air Base served as a logistics hub for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. As Saliyah Army Base, the largest pre-positioning facility of U.S. equipment in the world, served as the forward command center for CENTCOM personnel during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Israel trade office in Qatar. Khanfar was also criticized to favor and be biased towards the Hamas political party in the Palestinian Territories, as opposed to the Palestinian Authority run by Fatah. Membership and activities Khanfar has the following memberships; member of International Crisis Group‚Äôs Board of Trustees, member of the World Economic Forum's (DAVOS) Global Agenda Council on Geopolitical Risk 2012, board member of the Global Editors Network:empower editors-in-chief and senior news executives from around the world looking for the preservation of editorial quality when working with publishers, media owners and news suppliers. Khanfar spoke at the 2011 TED Conference on the ongoing civil uprisings in the Arab Spring. First visit to the United States In July 2009, Khanfar was invited to the United States by leading political and media think tanks including the Middle East Institute, New America Foundation, Council on Foreign Relations, and George Washington University. This was the first time that a Director General from Al Jazeera has visited the US. During the visit Khanfar also met with senior officials and advisors at the White House, United States Department of State and the Pentagon. On the visit to the US, Khanfar appeared on the Charlie Rose Show, NPR‚Äôs Diane Rehm show, and presented at the Paley Center for Media.

These efforts include training civil administrators, improving essential services and public safety, supporting civil society and self-determination, and promoting the rule of law and economic development. After more than two decades of war and unrest in Afghanistan, reconstruction efforts continue to be hampered by the ongoing conflicts. The reconstruction process of Afghanistan began in 2002. Many of these projects are being supervised by the Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The World Bank contribution is the multilateral Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), which was set up in 2002, by the ideas of Noor Rahman Liwal. There are more than 14,000 reconstruction projects under way in Afghanistan, such as the Kajaki and the Salma Dam.. It is financed by 24 international donor countries and has spent more than $1.37 billion as of 2007. Approximately 30 billion dollars have been provided by the international community for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, most of it from the United States. In 2002, the world community allocated $4 billion at the Tokyo conference followed by another $4 billion in 2004. In February 2006, $10.5 billion were committed for Afghanistan at the London Conference and $11 billion from the United States in early 2007. Despite these vast investments by the international community, the reconstruction effort's results have been mixed. Implementation of development projects at the district and sub-district level has been frequently marred by lack of coordination, knowledge of local conditions, and sound planning on the side of international donors as well as by corruption and inefficiency on the side of Afghan government officials. On the provincial and national level, projects such as the National Solidarity Programme, inter-provincial road construction, and the US-led revamping of rural health services have met with more success. One major development goal is the completion of the ring road - a series of highways linking the major cities of Afghanistan.Afghanistan: Ring Road's Completion Would Benefit Entire RegionRoad reconstruction map The United States has poured tens of billions of dollars into the reconstruction effort. It has established the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction to provide oversight. This office is presently headed by John Sopko. In September Sopko said in connexion with the effort, \\"all I'm seeing is a modus operandi that's woefully out of touch at best, and delusional at worst\\". He also said, \\"It seems that time and again, people have to be reminded that Afghanistan is not Kansas\\". He complained that many people, especially at USAID, design programmes \\"without considering the fact that you have a tribal government, that you have a criminal element there\\". He said that although 8 billion dollars had been spent combatting the narcotics trade, he thought the effort overall was an abject failure. More acres are growing opium, more opium is being produced, there are tighter relationships between the opium traffickers and the terrorists (who are getting more money), and there are more Afghan addicts. But American officials consider it a success because they have trained a certain number of narcotics police, prosecutors, et cetera.BBC Newshour, Sept. 21, 2015.  Foreign assistance  Kazakhstan is providing food and development assistance to Afghanistan. Kazakhstan has delivered $20 million worth food products since 2002 and $50 million in scholarships for Afghan students to study in Kazakhstan. Multiple countries in NATO have also contributed to assistance.  Protection payments to Taliban  According to the lawsuit, filed in December 2019 in the D.C. District Court on behalf of Gold Star families, U.S. contractors involved in Afghanistan reconstruction projects, including Louis Berger Group and Development Alternatives Incorporated, made illegal \\"protection payments\\" to the Taliban, funding a \\"Taliban-led terrorist insurgency\\" that killed or wounded thousands of Americans in Afghanistan.

Life Kirch was born in Volkach, Bavaria, but shortly afterward his family moved to the nearby town of W√ºrzburg. After completing high school, he studied marketing and management as well as mathematics at the University of Munich, graduating in 1952. It was during this time that he gained an interest in electronic media. Borrowing money from his wife's family, he purchased exclusive German rights for the Italian movie La strada in 1960. As his company rose to become one of the most important private media companies in the then West Germany, the country's second public broadcaster, ZDF, came to depend on it heavily for films and other programs, partly as a result of companies that appeared to be competing actually being owned by Kirch. This situation remained for many decades, until the launch of commercial television in 1984. Kirch was the owner of the first private channel, Sat.1 and withdrew his series from ZDF. In 1985 he purchased a stake in the leading tabloid Bild after the death of former owner Axel Springer. During the 1990s he set up the subscription television service Premiere and became a key player in sports broadcasting rights, paying massive amounts for the rights to the German Bundesliga, eventually to the point where even players of moderate ability could earn multi-million mark salaries. This was consistent with trends happening across much of Europe at the same time. In addition, in 1996 he purchased the rights to the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups for some ‚Ç¨1.9 billion and purchased the rights to Formula One for ‚Ç¨1.5 billion. Even during this decade there were reports of the group being on the edge of insolvency. His large investments in sports broadcasting rights and in pay television were major reasons. In other countries of Europe pay television could be operated profitably, because there were few freely receivable channels. Many programs also aired on Premiere at the same time that they aired on terrestrial television. This resulted in an investment of some ‚Ç¨3 billion for only 2.4 million subscribers. Combined with the fact that many of the packages were more expensive than similar packages available, the decoder was easy to crack, resulting in large amounts of piracy. In 2002 these difficulties came to a head and KirchMedia declared itself insolvent on April 8. Kirch himself withdrew itself from the enterprise, but kept up participation in the Swiss arms on his business, transferring sports broadcasting rights to the subsidiary. The insolvency represents the largest insolvency of an enterprise in German postwar history. The next month Kirch sued Deutsche Bank for ‚Ç¨100m, claiming that they had questioned the status of the group and disclosed confidential business information in the process. Kirch and Kohl Leo Kirch and former Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl were on friendly terms for decades. Kirch was always accused of preferential coverage and advertising. Kohl arranged the creation of commercial television as one of his first official acts as Chancellor in 1982; this allowed Kirch to own a TV station and sports broadcasting rights. During the 1999 CDU contributions scandal, it was revealed that Kirch had donated six million DM to the CDU during Helmut Kohl's tenure as chancellor. In addition, Kohl, along with various other CDU/CSU politicians, was revealed to be an adviser to the firm during the insolvency process.

Moreover, according to the WSJ, the lawfirm that was representing Kirch was the target, and perhaps victim of, an effort to infiltrate a \\"mole\\" into the firm in furtherance of the Bank's spying. Kirch sued Deutsche Bank after Rolf E. Breuer, chief executive at the time, appeared on Bloomberg Television in 2002 and commented on the Kirch Group's creditworthiness, saying that the financial sector was unwilling to lend to the company (the Kirch Group was a client of the Bank at the time). Kirch asserted that the Bank had breached German confidentiality laws and tried to damage his company's reputation, blaming the Bank for the Kirch Group's collapse.https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/deutsche-bank-to- pay-1-06-billion-to-settle-long-running-litigation/?_r=0 After decades of litigation, Deutsche Bank announced in 2014 that it would pay Kirch's heirs more than ‚Ç¨775 million ($1.06 billion) in a legal settlement, although it denies the allegations contended by Kirch. Death Kirch suffered from diabetes and a heart condition, becoming partially blind as a result. He died in Munich, aged 84. Family Kirch had been married since 1954 to Ruth Kirch (n√©e Wiegand). The two had one son, Thomas., and a son from a previous relationship, Peter. Peter Kirch had one son Kristoffer Kirch, born on October 31.1987 in Hamburg who now resides in Los Angeles CA with Business ventures on his own.

It covers around . Dyrehaven is noted for its mixture of huge, ancient oak trees and large populations of red and fallow deer. In July 2015, it was one of the three forests included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed as Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand. All entrances to the park have a characteristic red gate; one of the most popular entrances is Klampenborg gate, close to Klampenborg station. All the entrance gates have an identical gate house attached to them, which serve as the residences of the forest wardens. Dyrehaven is maintained as a natural forest, with the emphasis on the natural development of the woods over commercial forestry. Old trees are felled only if they are a danger to the public. It has herds of about 2100 deer in total, with 300 Red Deer, 1700 Fallow Deer and 100 Sika Deer. Dyrehaven is also the venue for the Hermitage road race (Eremitagel√∏bet) and the yearly Hubertus hunt (Hubertusjagten) which is held on the first Sunday in November. In former times it was home to the Fortunl√∏bet race, later known as Ermelundsl√∏bet, but this race was discontinued in 1960. History In 1669 Frederik III decided that the wood of \\"Boveskov\\" (\\"Beech wood\\") should be fenced in and wild deer from the surrounding areas driven into the newly created park. Boveskov was already well known as the former property of Valdemar the Victorious as it had been recorded in his census (the Liber Census Dani√¶) of 1231. The forest lay in the westerly and southerly part of the present Dyrehaven and encompassed land used by the farmers from the village of Stokkerup, which lay to the north. Fencing work consisted of excavating a ditch, the earth from which was built up in a bank on the outside walls of the ditch, on the opposite side to the centre of the park. On the top of the bank posts were driven into the ground and fences installed. This made it more difficult for the deer to leap the fence, as the rise between the ditch and the bank effectively increased the level of the fence. The ditch and bank can still be seen for a long stretch in the south-easterly part of the current park. The work was never finished, as Frederik III died in 1670. The design, however, is still on record, and the area for the scheme worked out at around 3 square kilometres. When Frederik's son, Christian V, became king, he laid out new and more ambitious plans for Dyrehaven. During his education Christian V had spent time at the court of Louis XIV in France. Here he had seen another type of hunting practice, parforce (hunting with dogs), that he wished to adopt. This style of hunting required a greater area of land for its practice, so Christian V increased the boundaries to include the fields up to the village of Stokkerup (the area known today as Eremitagesletten), as well as taking in the land that today is J√¶gersborg Hegn. The additional enclosure increased the size of the park to . The inhabitants of Stokkerup, whose village pond still lies within Eremitagesletten area, were ordered to tear down their houses and make use of the materials to rebuild the farms in the area that had stood empty since the Northern Wars. They were compensated for this by having a period of three years during which they were exempt from taxation. The Hermitage, a royal hunting lodge Areas in Dyrehaven=Eremitagesletten= A 19th Century view of Dyrehaven by Sigfried Hass. Eremitagesletten at sunset Fallow deer passing in front of the Hermitage Eremitagesletten is an area in the north of the park. Originally this area was the fields of the village of Stokkerup, but was enclosed when Christian needed it for hunting with dogs. Evidence of this can be clearly seen from the roads which are laid out in the classic star form that was typical for areas used in this form of hunting. In the middle of Eremitagesletten is the Hermitage, built during the reign of Christian VI. Eremitagesletten is encircled by forest. From Hjortek√¶r to the north and the east there is a row of chestnut trees that make up the boundaries of the plain. This row of trees marked the northern extent of Dyrehaven until 1913, when the boundaries were extended north of M√∏lle√•en. =M√∏lle√•en= This is an area north of Eremitagesletten near R√•dvad along the banks of the Millstream. =Fortunens Indelukke= Fortunens Indelukke is an area in the west of Dyrehaven. It is fenced in and is the only part of the forest that the deer do not have access to. There are a few other areas also fenced in, but only smaller and temporary to save the young trees. =Ulvedalene= Ulvedalene with Dj√¶vlebakken in the background. The many tents and constructions are part of the theatre production. Ulvedalene has Dyrehaven's hilliest terrain, which was created during the last ice age. Dj√¶vlebakken, a popular sledging run is found in this part of the park. Ulvedalsteateret (Ulvedal theatre) gave performances for 39 years in Ulvedalene. The first time was in the summer of 1910 with Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl√§ger's Hagbart and Signe. The idea originated from the actor Adam Poulsen and producer Henrik Cavling. The architect Jens Ferdinand Willumsen created spaces for about 4,000 sitting and 2,000 standing spectators, which made it possible to lower the ticket price to an accessible level. The theatre survived up to 1949, and after a break of almost 50 years, the tradition was revived by Birgitte Price with an arrangement of Johan Ludvig Heiberg's Elverh√∏j in 1996 in a production supported by the Royal Danish Theatre, Lyngby-Taarb√¶k Kommune and Kulturby'96. Since then there have been further performances, the latest, R√∏de Orm, in 2018. =Von Langens Plantage= This is the southernmost part of Dyrehaven and the most visited. Dyrehavsbakken Dyrehavsbakken (colloquially Bakken and literally in English \\"The Deer Park's Hill\\") is the world's oldest existing amusement park. Kirsten Piils Kilde Kirsten Piil's Spring. The water is still potable. Kirsten Piils Kilde (Kirsten Piil's Spring) was discovered in 1583 by Kirsten Piil about whom little is known. Legend states Kirsten was a pious woman, who, through her devotion, gave the spring curative powers, which made it a place of pilgrimage for the sick who would come to drink the water. Peter Lieps Hus Peter Lieps Hus (Peter Liep's House) is now a well-known restaurant. It is named after Dyrehaven's first sharpshooter, Peter Liep. The house was originally called Kildehuset (Spring house) and is thought to have been to be built towards the end of the 18th century. In the 1860s a two-storey extension was added that gave the house a clumsy appearance. Peter Liep took over the building in 1888. In September 1915 the house burned to the ground, but it was reconstructed by 1916. In 1928 the house burned down again. It was rebuilt to a different design, basically as it can be seen today. After some years a pavilion and toilets were added. Visitor numbers consistently rose (the house had already achieved a good reputation as a restaurant by the end of the 19th century). In 1952 a fire again broke out in the house. The fire was extinguished before it did any major damage: a hole was burned in the thatched roof, but later the same day the extensions caught fire and burned down, and only the main farmhouse was able to be saved. The extensions were rebuilt in 1954 and a new pavilion added in 1960. All these buildings are today known under the collective name \\"Peter Lieps Hus\\", though the house is very different from the house Peter Liep lived in on the same spot. Fortunen Fortunen restaurant Fortunen (The Fortune) is a former ranger station on the King's hunting road to Dyrehaven, named after the Roman goddess of luck Fortuna. It is now home to a hotel and restaurant.

It was released on March 12, 2002. The game requires the player to build buildings and create units in order to defeat the enemy, whilst sending their hero on optional quests. The game is set within the world of Etheria. In the campaign the player must take control of one of the twelve races and capture all sixty- seven regions of the land in a non-linear manner. The player does this whilst assuming the role of a \\"Hero\\" which he or she has created. There are twelve different playable races, each with their own type of Hero, buildings and resource dependencies. The game was well received by critics and users alike, with an average score of 82/100 on Metacritic. Warlords Battlecry III, the sequel to the game, was released in 2004. Gameplay In-game screenshot, showing the daemon race attacking the humans. Primarily a real-time strategy game, the main objective of Warlords Battlecry II is to build up a base and army in order to fight enemies. A game will usually end when all but one of the players has been defeated, although there are some minor differences depending on which victory condition is selected. Most buildings and units are created by spending resources, while some buildings and units can also be summoned by certain units. There are twelve different playable races, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and resource dependencies. There are roughly a hundred and forty controllable units which will fight and, in some cases, build buildings. The game also features some basic Role-playing video game elements including leveling-up characters and completing optional quests. In addition to these units, the player controls a Hero which they have created before playing. The Hero is a unique unit which, as well as being able to fight and build buildings, can cast spells and receive quests. Depending on the outcome of a battle, the Hero will receive experience points and level up, as is common in many role-playing games. There are two main game modes: the campaign and skirmish mode. The campaign is non-linear, with a goal of conquering the entire continent of Etheria (the land in which the game is set). Skirmish games can be played against computer-controlled enemies and other human players. All the game modes and victory conditions available in the campaign are playable, as well as some multiplayer-only modes. The game also comes with a level editor. Development On October 4, 2001, SSG announced that a sequel to Warlords Battlecry was in development and was at the stages of beta-testing. The game was slated to feature a non-linear campaign (as opposed to the linear, story-driven campaign of the game's predecessor) and feature almost a hundred and forty different unit types (sixty of which would be brand new), twelve races (nine from the previous game, three created specifically for this game), 20 hero classes and more than a hundred spells and special abilities. Six days later, on October 10, 2001 a new official website was launched, featuring a summary of the game's features as well as screenshots, desktop wallpapers, message boards and information on the armies and races. Over the following months, details concerning the units and races were added to the website. After the game's release the website provided a source of official downloads. Patches, custom AIs, scenarios and tools were made available to download. On February 5, 2002 SSG released a 100MB demo of the game. It featured two maps, two playable races, and two spell spheres. It was made available for download from the German Ubisoft website. Ubisoft announced on February 21 that the game had gone gold and was on target for its release date of March 12. This target was met and on March 12 the game was released across the U.S., with a retail price of $39.99. Critical reception The campaign map of Etheria. Warlords Battlecry II was praised for replacing the story-driven campaign of its predecessor with a non- linear campaign.The game generally received positive reviews, with Metacritic giving an average score of 82 out of 100 (\\"generally favourable reviews\\"). The Armchair Empire said that \\"...[playing the] game has been the most fun I‚Äôve had in playing an RTS since Dungeon Keeper 2 and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness\\". The review site rated the game 8.9/10. PC Gamer US described the game as \\"welcome on my computer for a long time to come\\", in particular praising the non-linear campaign and the sheer scope of the game, awarding it 90%. IGN stated that \\"...[Warlords Battlecry II] may not have a ton of really noticeable new things when it comes down to the real-time strategy aspect of play, but it definitely had enough to draw me through my jaded curtain and get me playing and interested again\\". It too praised the campaign, giving the game an overall rating of 8.5 out of a possible 10. GameSpot, whilst describing the game as \\"a solid real-time strategy game\\" and giving it a rating of 8.2 out of 10, noted that \\"[the game] doesn't take a big leap forward\\". According to the game's Metacritic page, this was an opinion held by many reviewers. Another criticism concerned the game's save feature. Despite the positive review the game received from The Armchair Empire, it criticised the save feature. The review described how \\"....during battles, saves are unlimited, but there [can be only one saved game (the most recent save)], meaning that a save at an inopportune time is worse than no save at all\\". UGO praised the AI, stating, \\"It seldom uses a tank rush until the very end. Rather, it'll often feint, spy and harass you. It'll often send its hero to convert your mines, to draw your units away from your town to chase him back to his city hall, while other units invade your area. It'll send minor units to hack at your buildings, and it is very good at hiding its numbers using the Fog of War. At the start of a campaign, the computer is pretty much a pushover, but as the game progresses, you'll often find your hands full.\\" According to the game's official website, the game received three awards: PC Gamer US' Editor's Choice award, Computer Gaming World's Editor's Choice award and Computer Games Magazines' Editor's Choice award. The editors of Computer Games Magazine named Warlords Battlecry II the fifth-best computer game of 2002, and wrote that it \\"manages to take elements of some of the best games out there‚ÄîTotal Annihilation, StarCraft‚Äîand create something that works better than most of its influences.\\" It also received the magazine's \\"Best Interface\\" award. Warlords Battlecry II was nominated for Computer Gaming Worlds 2002 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Freedom Force. The editors called Battlecry II \\"a perfect example of an honest-to-god RPS (role-playing strategy)\\", but explained that its relative lack of innovation \\"kept it from grabbing the gold.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2002 video games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Strategic Studies Group games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Warlords (video game series) Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Warlords Battlecry II"},{"id":"10345541","text":"Fatemeh Keshavarz Ph.D. () (born 1952) is an Iranian academic, Rumi and Persian studies scholar, and a poet in Persian and English.

In 2012, she became the Director and Chair of Roshan Institute Center for Persian Studies at University of Maryland. Among Keshavarz's works is her book Jasmine and Stars: Reading more than Lolita in Tehran. The book offers ideas in contrast to Azar Nafisi's Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books (Random House, 2003) that explores the relationship between literature and society in the post-revolutionary Iran. Keshavarz believes that Nafisi's book presents \\"many damaging misrepresentations\\" of Iran and its people, relying more on stereotypes and easy comparisons than on an accurate portrayal of the country and its people.Reading More than Lolita in Tehran: An Interview with Fatemeh Keshavarz Monthly Review (12 March 2007)Fatemeh Keshavarz, Banishing the Ghosts of Iran The Chronicle Review of Higher Education, Vol. 53, No. 45, p.

It is located west of Fifth Avenue, centered opposite East 74th Street. The pond is surrounded by several landscaped hills, including Pilgrim Hill dotted by groves of Yoshino cherry trees and Pug Hill, resulting in a somewhat manicured park landscape, planned in deferential reference to the estate plantings of the owners of the mansions that once lined the adjacent stretch of Fifth Avenue. Conservatory Water is named for a glass-house for tropical plants and was intended to be entered from Fifth Avenue by a grand stair. The shore of Conservatory Water contains the Kerbs Memorial Boathouse, where patrons can rent and navigate radio-controlled model boats, as well as bronze sculptures. The water was supplied from the Ramble and Lake, the site of the historic Sawkill stream, which once flowed through here on its way to the East River. When Central Park was built in the mid-19th century, hardy water lilies were naturalized in the bottom mud and tender ones were wintered over in the park's conservatory. Later, the naturalistic water lily pond was reshaped as a model boat pond. History Conservatory Water is named for another estate-garden feature, a glass-house for tropical plants, to be entered from Fifth Avenue by a grand stair. The garden had been proposed in the Greensward Plan of 1857, during a design competition for Central Park where the Greensward Plan ultimately won out. Several other proposals submitted during the competition did not include a formal garden. The two principal designers of the Greensward Plan, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, instead suggested building a conservatory on the site of the proposed formal garden, with a \\"hard-edged\\" reflecting pool in the middle. Only the reflecting pool was constructed, though. A naturalistic pond displaying water lilies was excavated. The steep bank towards Fifth Avenue was densely planted with shrubs and trees, including birch‚Äîfor quick cover‚Äîand copper beech. Samuel Parsons, Calvert Vaux's assistant and partner, who was named Superintendent of Plantings, described the effect in his Landscape Gardening (1891): > The general shape of this pond was oval, with winding, irregular shores, > bounded by a high bank on the east side and a great willow drooping over the > north end. Rocks were disposed in the immediate banks, so as to suggest a > natural formation, rather than an artificial pond. The bottom, scarcely > three feet deep, was cemented tight as a cup, and the water flowed gently in > at one end, and out at the other, and so through a basin and into the sewer. > Eighteen inches of soil was made rich with manure and deposited over the > bottom. The water was supplied from the Ramble and Lake, the site of the historic Sawkill stream, which once flowed through here on its way to the East River. G. E. Hill and G. E. Waring Jr, \\"Old wells and watercourses on the isle of Manhattan, part I\\" in M. W. Goodwin et al., eds., 1897. Historic New York: Being the First Series of the Half Moon Papers, quoted in Hardy water lilies, both European and American, were naturalized in the bottom mud and tender ones, planted in boxes, were wintered over in the park's conservatory, now the site of Conservatory Garden. Conservatory Water during a winter sunset, facing east Since the 1860s, children had sailed their model yachts at the pond. Later, the naturalistic water lily pond was reshaped as a model boat pond loosely based on that of one in the Jardin du Luxembourg, in Paris.Sergey Kadinsky (2016). Hidden Waters of New York City: A History and Guide to 101 Forgotten Lakes, Ponds, Creeks, and Streams in the Five BoroughsDorling Kindersley (2012). Eyewitness Travel Family Guide New York City The formally shaped shallow basin is set in a molded curb of \\"Atlantic Blue\\" granite, which replaced a concrete curb in 2000. It is home water to a flotilla of model sailboats. The model sailboats were made familiar in the pages of E.B. White's children's realistic fantasy novel Stuart Little (1945) about a mouse-like human boy who sailed his ship on Conservatory Water. The novel was recreated in the popular family animated/live-action comedy 1999 film of the same name.  Boathouse  The Kerbs Memorial Boathouse The eastern shore of Conservatory Water contains the Kerbs Memorial Boathouse, designed by architect Aymar Embury II, where patrons can rent and navigate radio-controlled and wind- powered model boats. The 1954 boathouse, in picnic Georgian taste with red brick and a green copper hip roof and steeple, outside of which is a flagstone patio, houses resident model sailboats as well as the radio-controlled model yachts of the Central Park Model Yacht Club. Surroundings The waters of Conservatory Water shelter a seasonal population of unusual minute freshwater jellyfish, Craspedacusta sowerbyi. In the sculptured Beaux-Arts pediment of an upper-floor window of 927 Fifth Avenue, overlooking Conservatory Water, the red-tailed hawk named \\"Pale Male\\" set up a nest, under the binocular watch of the Park's numerous bird-watchers. =Pilgrim Hill= Flowering Yoshino cherry trees on Pilgrim Hill Pilgrim Hill lies to the southwest of Conservatory Water, just inside the park entrance at 5th Avenue and on the north side of 72nd Street. Its slopes are popular among locals for sledding in the winter when Central Park receives 6 inches of snow, for groves of pale flowering Yoshino cherry trees as they burst into bloom in the spring, and for picnics and lounging in warmer months. The slopes are dotted by Prunus serrulata and other specimen trees, notably a globose European Hornbeam and nine species of oak, all set in rolling lawn. They are surveyed by artist John Quincy Adams Ward's bronze statue of The Pilgrim, a tall stylized representation of one of the Pilgrims, British immigrants to the New World led by William Bradford who left from Plymouth, England, in the cargo ship Mayflower in September 1620. The statue faces westward on the crest of a little knoll at the top of the hill, on a rusticated Quincy granite pedestal that was created by architect Richard Morris Hunt and contains four bas-reliefs (depicting the ship the Mayflower, Bible and Sword, Cross-Bow and Arrows, and Commerce), overlooking the East Drive at East 72nd Street. The statue was donated to New York City in 1885 by the New England Society of New York. = Pug Hill = Pug Hill is located to the northwest of the Alice and Wonderland statue and was a popular place for the city's pug owners to socialize in the late 1990s through the mid-2000s. At times, there were so many pugs present that they were described as a fawn and black whirlpool moving through the grass. However, Pug Hill gatherings were ended due to heavy NYC Parks enforcement. In 2006, Pug Hill was the inspiration for an eponymous book. =Alice in Wonderland sculpture= Bronze sculptural groups set in small terraces front the Conservatory Water. One to the north, parallel with East 74th Street, commemorates Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, with an tall Alice (whose face is modeled on that of the sculptor's daughter) sitting on a large mushroom at a tea party held by the Mad Hatter (whose face is supposedly modeled on that of George Delacorte) with the March Hare, the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, and Alice's kitten Dinah in her lap. It was created in 1959 by sculptor Jos√© de Creeft, patterned on illustrations drawn by John Tenniel, commissioned by philanthropist George Delacorte in honor of his wife, and forged in the Modern Art Foundry in Queens, New York. It is favored by children who enjoy climbing on it, which was contemplated in its design. At the base of the statue, among other inscriptions, is a line from Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem \\"Jabberwocky\\". =Hans Christian Andersen sculpture= Another sculptural group, to the west of the Conservatory Water, commemorates Danish fable author Hans Christian Andersen and the Ugly Duckling (1955), sculpted by Georg John Lober.Elizabeth Barlow Rogers (2018). Saving Central Park; A History and a Memoir A larger-than-life-size Anderson sits on a Stony Creek polished pink granite bench with an open book on his lap, turned to the story of \\"The Ugly Duckling,\\" with a -tall bronze duck at his feet. In the palm of Andersen's left hand, the sculptor inscribed: \\"In appreciation of the help and encouragement my wife Nellie has always given me affectionately, Georg, 1956.\\" The statue is meant to be climbed on. The sculpture was cast in the Modern Art Foundry. These sculptures were built by NYC Parks commissioner Robert Moses in the 1950s as part of the park's \\"Children's District\\". Another statue, that of the fictional Mary Poppins, was not constructed. =Waldo Hutchins bench= Discreetly sited overlooking Conservatory Water, just inside Central Park north-west of the park's East 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue entrance, and east of Pilgrim Hill, is a curved Concord white granite exedra (a design from ancient Greece and Rome) outdoor bench.Henry Hope Reed, Sophia Duckworth (1972). Central Park; a History and a GuideAndrea Kannapell (1999).The Curious New Yorker; 329 Fascinating Questions and Surprising Answers about New York City.Natalie Zaman (2016). Magical Destinations of the Northeast; Sacred Sites, Occult Oddities & Magical MonumentsElizabeth Macaulay-Lewis, Matthew McGowan (2018). Classical New York; Discovering Greece and Rome in Gotham. It commemorates Waldo Hutchins (1822‚Äì1891), a member of the original Board of Commissioners for Central Park, New York City Park Commissioner (1857‚Äì69 and 1887‚Äì91), and a three-term Representative to the U.S. Congress (1879‚Äì85). The bench is almost tall by long, and weighs several tons. Waldo Hutchins Bench Sundial, New York, USA, October 6, 2016. The cost of the bench was $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Its architect was Eric Gugler, and in 1932 it was executed by the Piccirilli Brothers studio, the firm that carved the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. The bench has a small sundial, a variation on a 3rd century BC Hellenistic period Berossus sundial, at its back designed by sculptor Albert Stewart. The sundial features a small Art Deco bronze gnomon sculpture of a female dancer trailed by a wind- blown gown and flowing scarves at its center. The gnomon sculpture was crafted by sculptor Paul Manship, who created the 18-foot (5.5 m)-tall bronze gilded Prometheus statue at Rockefeller Center.Istv√°n Hargittai, Magdolna Hargittai (2017). New York Scientific; A Culture of Inquiry, Knowledge, and Learning Incised in the bench and paving three semicircular arced lines match the bench shelf‚Äôs shadow lines at 10:00 a.m., noon, and 2:00 p.m. at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes--though today daylight saving time has thrown the times off by one hour in the spring. There are two Latin inscriptions etched into the back of the bench: vivas oportet si vis tibi vivere (\\"One must live for another, if he wishes to live for himself\\"; a quotation of the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger); and the sundial reads ne diruatur fuga temporum (\\"Let it not be destroyed by the passage of time\\"). If two people sit at opposite ends of the bench and speak softly into it, they can hear each other easily. On the backside to the west, Pilgrim Hill overlooks the bench and Conservatory Water.

History=Bi-lateral school= The school was built in 1963 (opening on 10 September) and was named after Arthur Terry, who was the Mayor of Sutton Coldfield from 1934 to 1935. It was sometimes known as the Arthur Terry Grammar/High School, with around 950 boys and girls. Boys were required to wear bow ties, with a light shade of bronze; this was the idea of the head master, Mr Dennis Lindley. The uniform was initially popular. Knitted nylon conventional ties were equally allowed, and eventually replaced the bow tie due to their greater popularity with wearers. It was run by Warwickshire Education Committee, specifically the excepted district of the Borough of Sutton Coldfield. It was a bilateral school with a grammar stream, similar to a grammar school. From April 1974 it was administered by Birmingham City Council. =Comprehensive= In March 1999, BBC Radio 4's Music Machine programme came from the school, interviewing the clarinettist Emma Johnson. The school underwent a ¬£15 million rebuilding program, designed by architects Watkins Gray International (www.wgi.co.uk), that saw most of the original school demolished to make way for the new buildings; only the Sports Hall, Drama Studio and Sixth Form Centre have remained. =Academy= The school became an academy in August 2012, and is no longer under LA control, However the school continues to co-ordinate admission with Birmingham LA. Activities The school is also well known for its shows each year, including Grease, Les Mis√©rables and Godspell. The school's most recent production was of We Will Rock You, which sold out to 10 full houses spread over two weeks. The school implemented a vertical tutoring system at the start of the 2007/8 school year. Every tutor group now has a mix of 2‚Äì7 students from each Year Group. The school also has its own student-run radio station, named ATRfm which broadcasts internally. The school has been criticised, amongst several other British schools, for making use of the Brain Gym 'mental exercise' programme, which claims that 'the brain is a muscle' and that a set of hand and leg movements and chest rubs can promote learning. Commonly described as pseudoscience, physician Ben Goldacre has described the programme as 'ludicrous' while Teacher of the Year award-winner Philip Beadle described it as 'moonshine...you'd probably get as much benefit from taking a Brain Gym book and booting it around the room'. The Arthur Terry School used to be the home of one of the best junior Ultimate Frisbee teams in the country, Arctic Ultimate. The team consistently finished in the top 3 in national junior tournaments with a large volume of students making the Great Britain squad for under 17s, under 20s, under 23s and open. Arctic Ultimate alumni are still playing today at universities and clubs across the country. Headteacher The former Headteacher Sir Christopher Stone was knighted for his outstanding contribution to system leadership nationally. Chris stepped down in 2011 to take up a position of CEO for the Arthur Terry Learning Partnership: the multi academy trust which currently over sees 7 schools in Birmingham and Warwickshire. Previous to Sam Kibble taking on the role of Associate Headteacher; the school was led by two joint Headteachers, Richard Gill and Neil Warner. Richard and Neil were made NLEs in September 2015 recognising the impact they have had in supporting other school communities as well as raising standards further at Arthur Terry. Richard was appointed as CEO of the Arthur Terry Learning Partnership. Neil led the Arthur Terry School for one year as Headteacher as well as being the senior lead for secondary schools within the ATLP. Academic performance Arthur Terry is consistently the highest performing comprehensive school in Birmingham according to DfE league tables for KS4 and is in the top 10% nationally for mixed community comprehensive schools. In 2012 it was chosen to become one of the first National Teaching Schools. Notable alumni *Duncan Gibbins, TV Presenter and film Director.

Early Life and education Whitaker was born in Blackpool, Lancashire. He studied at the Blackpool and the Fylde School of Art for 6 years from the age of 13 and moved to London in the late 1950s, where he began working as a graphic designer. He did not enjoy the work, and left to become a milkman instead. The early hours suited him: his job finished early, and he could spend the rest of the day painting. He married fellow artist Frances Wood in 1959, and studied as a mature student at the Royal Academy Schools from 1962 to 1966. Later Career and Recognition Whitaker won the Mark Rothko Memorial Award in 1973 at the recommendation of Bridget Riley, which allowed him to work in the U.S. for several months. He then taught at the Ruskin School of Art in Oxford, helping to oversee the school's merger with the University of Oxford, before becoming a lecturer at the Wimbledon College of Art in 1984, retiring in 2001. He was elected as a member of the London Group in 1989, of the Colour Group (Great Britain) in 1996, and became a Fellow of the Royal Watercolour Society in 2004. He won a Hunting Art Prize in 1996, and won the Singer Friedlander National Watercolour Competition in 2001. Beginning in the 1960s, Whitaker held many one-man exhibitions over more than 40 years as a practitioner. Works Whitaker's works in oils and watercolour are characterised by their use of straight lines of seven colours: two shades of yellow, cadmium red, magenta, viridian, and two shades of blue. His paintings were created in layers, using tape to create straight-sided stencils. The final effect, only revealed when the tape was removed, produced a shimmering graduation of colour from stripe to stripe over the canvass. Personal life Outside art, Whitaker was a keen marathon runner with Kingston Stragglers, and played cricket in the Lancashire League. He died in 2007 in Kingston upon Thames and was survived by his wife, Frances, and their three sons.

Knight Black Diamond was a buffalo or North American bison, housed at Central Park Menagerie (Central Park Zoo); according to legend, it was the model for the US buffalo nickel coin introduced in 1913, designed and sculpted by American sculptor James Earle Fraser in 1911. Black Diamond was born in 1893 of a bull and cow given to the zoo by Barnum and Bailey. It weighed 1550 pounds (ultimately yielding 750 pounds of usable meat). It was a popular attraction at the zoo. Sick and disabled at age 22, Black Diamond was put up for auction June 28, 1915. However, no bids were received. It was purchased for slaughter in a private sale for $300 by A. Silz, inc., a game and poultry dealer.Zoo's Big Buffalo Sold To A Butcher It was slaughtered November 17 and \\"Black Diamond Steaks\\" were sold for $2 a pound. Fred Santer, a New York taxidermist, mounted Black Diamond's head and turned its hide into a then-fashionable 13-foot automobile robe. In the April 1952 issue of Natural History magazine, George S. Goodwin, the Associate Curator of Mammals at the Museum of Natural History, wrote \\"(Black Diamond) was an excellent object for the artistic brush. ... Despite his size, he was quite docile. This virtue made him the perfect model.\\" However, James Fraser never said that Black Diamond had been his model, and the Bureau of the Mint has doubts as to whether any specific bison was Fraser's model, their argument being that Fraser would have been well familiar with the species already. It is also reported to have been the model for the obverse (face) of the $10 U.S. Banknote, Series 1901.

The mainly agricultural town is located between Simpang Ampat to the north and Sungai Bakap to the south, both of which are also within the South Seberang Perai District. Jalan Valdor serves as the main thoroughfare within the town, with the southern end of the road connecting with Federal Route 1, which runs the length of western Peninsular Malaysia.  Etymology  In French, Val d'Or meant a valley of gold. The town of Val d'Or had a French connection in the mid-19th century, when two Frenchmen arrived and set up an agricultural estate within the town.  History  In the mid-19th century, a Frenchman by the name of Donnadieu arrived at what is now Val d'Or. He subsequently established a sugar cane plantation at the area, and was later joined by a second Frenchman, L√©opold Chasseriau. However, Donnadieu came to a tragic end when he was murdered by unknown assassins. Meanwhile, in 1852, Kee Lye Huat, an ethnic Chinese, landed in Province Wellesley (now Seberang Perai). Starting out as a coolie, he gradually became a successful sugar planter and the owner of the Val d'Or sugar cane estate; he is now credited as the founder of the town. Kee also played an instrumental role in the development of nearby Sungai Bakap. In 1872, he established the Kee Poh Huat Kongsi in Sungai Bakap, where his descendants still reside to this day.http://www.pht.org.my/newsletters/2000_06.pdf  Education  Val d'Or is home to a Chinese primary school and a high school, SJKC Valdor and SMK Valdor, respectively  Transportation  Val d'Or is accessible via either the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway's Jawi Interchange (Exit 156) or Bukit Tambun Interchange (Exit 158).

History  Bombones was born in Seville, (Spain), in early 2000s, where due to the love of the music that characterize both Juano and Goyo (working in a record store), they decided to join with Francis and Eduardo \\"Pollito\\" (former bass player) to play unusual power-pop covers, like Matthew Sweet, Velvet Crush or Redd Kross. Gradually, the own compositions began to take prominence in their set list. This concluded with the recording of a demo in 2002 at the Central Studio in Seville. The title that labels this first work was ‚ÄúMary Jane EP‚Äù. Five songs and one re-mix were included. ‚ÄúMary Jane‚Äù, the one that it would become first single of the band, it was one of the themes you could find in the EP. On October 2003, Bombones became finalist of the national demo competition organized by Rock Indiana. The result was obtained thanks to the popular voting by Internet. Eventually, the group was winning after a hard-fought final at the Moby Dick club in Madrid, and they took the first prize: recording a LP with the organizing record label of the contest, Rock-Indiana. On February 2004, the band arrived at the Paco Loco‚Äôs studio in Puerto de Santa Maria, trying to sign one of the best records within the Spanish pop panorama.

Like many species in the family, the matico tree has a peppery odor. It grows wild on the coasts and in the forests of Central and South America and in the Interandean Valleys, up to 3,000 meters above sea level. Culinary Use Like many species of the family, this tree has the characteristic smell of pepper. The fruits are used as a condiment and for flavoring cocoa. It is sometimes used as a substitute for long pepper. Traditional medicine In the Amazon Rainforest, many of the native tribes use matico leaves as an antiseptic. In Peru, it was used for stopping hemorrhages and treating ulcers, and in European practice in the treatment of diseases of the genitals and urinary organs, such as those for which cubeb was often prescribed. Essential oil The essential oil of matico contains dillapiole, ocimene and beta-caryophyllene. It has high potential as larvicide against larvae of mosquitoes. Characteristics Matico is a tropical, evergreen, shrubby tree that grows to the height of 6 to 7 meter (20 to 23 ft) with lance-shaped leaves that are 12 to 20 centimeter (5 to 8 in) long. Its fruit is a small drupe with black seeds. It is native to Southern Mexico, the Caribbean, and much of tropical South America. It is grown in tropical Asia, Polynesia, and Melanesia and can even be found in Florida, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. In some countries matico is considered as an invasive weed. In parts of New Guinea, although matico is notorious for drying out the soil in the areas where it is invasive, the wood of this plant is nonetheless used by local residents for a myriad of uses such as for fuel and fence posts. Etymology According to legends, the plant was discovered by a wounded Spanish soldier named Matico. He learned, presumably from the local tribes, that applying the leaves to his wounds stopped bleeding, and it began to be called \\"Matico\\" or \\"soldier's herb\\". It was introduced into the profession of medicine in the United States and Europe by a Liverpool physician in 1839 as a styptic and astringent for wounds.

Background=Indian emergency= Jayaprakash Narayan was a Gandhian leader in India after independence. When Indira Gandhi was found guilty of violating electoral laws by the Allahabad High Court, Narayan called for her to resign, and advocated a program of social transformation. He asked the military and police to disregard unconstitutional and immoral orders. However, Janata Party opposition leaders and dissenting members of Indira Gandhi's party, Congress (I) were arrested, beginning The Emergency in 1975. Narayan was detained at Chandigarh, and when released in 1976, formed the PUCLDR to oppose the suppression of civil and political rights during the emergency. The organization was thrown into disarray by his death and the election of the Janata party to power, which promised to enact the PUCL platform. Narayan originally intended PUCL to be an organisation free from political ideologies, bringing those concerned about defending civil liberties and human rights from different backgrounds onto a common platform. According to the PUCL, the PUCLDR was a loosely organised group of people who were working with Narayan, a prominent figure in the Indian Opposition in the 1970s. =Post-1980= After the return of Indira Gandhi to power in the 1980 elections in India, the organisation regained momentum and was renamed as the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). Its founding conference was held in November 1980. As of 2019, the President of the PUCL is Ravi Kiran Jain, Senior counsel from Allahabad, and the General Secretary is V. Suresh. Other notable office bearers include Dr. Binayak Sen, Sudha Bharadwaj and Kavita Shrivastava among others. Operations The founding conference of the PUCL in November 1980, drafted and adopted the organization's constitution, making it a membership based organization. The PUCL's constitution does not allow members of a political party to hold any office and hold membership in the PUCL; the number of members, belonging to political parties, in the national or state executive committees shall not be more than 50% of the members of the National Council and the National Executive Committee respectively (and also the corresponding bodies at the state and local level).

It presents its Journalism for Human Rights' Award which carries a citation and an award of Rs 20,000. PUCL, as its policy, does not accept money from any funding agency, Indian or foreign. All the expenses are met by the members, the office bearers, and the activists. The PUCL supports grassroots movements that focus on organizing and empowering the poor rather than using state initiatives for change. They have brought to light the cases of the bonded labourers, children in prison and violence committed against women undertrials. The PUCL has worked on the issue of the hundreds of people detained by India and Pakistan's governments and accused of espionage after trivial crimes like minor trespassing, a problem linked to the tension caused by the Kashmir conflict.Your World: The Nowhere Man, Rupa Jha, October 21, 2012, BBC (retr 2012 10 20) (Program link:The Nowhere Man) Charges against Dr Binayak Sen Binayak Sen, who is the National Vice-President of the Union and General Secretary of its Chhattisgarh unit, was arrested in May 2007 by security agencies for his alleged links with Maoists. In 2010, Sen was convicted of sedition and several other offences under Indian Penal Code by Raipur Sessions Court in Chhattisgarh after finding him and two others, guilty of sedition for helping the Maoists in their fight against the state. They were sentenced to life imprisonment. After his conviction, he was later released by the Supreme Court of India though the apex court said it was giving no reason for granting bail and left it to the satisfaction of the trial court concerned to impose the conditions for his release on bail. His appeal against conviction is pending with the Chhattisgarh High Court.

It is the Episcopal see of the Anglican Bishop of West Malaysia and the mother church of the diocese. History The original church was consecrated to the Virgin Mary by the Right Reverend George Frederick Hose, the Bishop of Singapore, Labuan & Sarawak, on 13 February 1887. This structure was built of timber on Bluff Road, on top of a hill now known as Bukit Aman, where the headquarters of the Royal Malaysian Police is now located. It served as the centre for worship and spiritual life for the small group of Anglicans around Kuala Lumpur at that period. Notable parishioners of the church in that period include the British Residents of Selangor, W.H. Treacher and F.A. Swettenham (later Resident- General of the Federated Malay States and Governor of the Straits Settlements). =Relocation= In 1893, a decision was made to erect a new building to house the growing congregation, and a new site was found beside the Padang or Parade Ground (now known as Dataran Merdeka or Independence Square) of the Selangor Club. The amount raised by the congregation for the building of the new church was supplemented by a gift of five thousand Straits dollars from the government of Selangor on a suggestion by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Cecil Clementi Smith. Notable local contributors to the building fund included personalities like Yap Kwan Seng and K. Thamboosamy Pillay, even though they were not Christians themselves. The foundation stone was laid on 3 February 1894 by the British Resident of Selangor, Sir W.H. Treacher, in a ceremony officiated over by Bishop G.F. Hose. On 9 February 1895, the 'first brick church erected in the native States of Malay Peninsula' was consecrated by the same Bishop. When the Diocese of West Malaysia was established in 1970, St. Mary's Church was made the see of the Bishop of West Malaysia. Architecture Interior of the Cathedral. The church management committee originally held a competition for the design for the new church. Unfortunately none of the designs submitted was considered good enough, and it finally fell to the Government architect, A.C.A. Norman, to propose a design based on Early English Gothic architecture. This design won general approval. The building consists of a nave 87 feet long by 28 feet wide, and a chancel 29 feet long by 22 feet wide with an octagonal end, together with a vestry and organ chamber. The nave can accommodate a congregation of 180 people and the chancel, a choir of 20. In 1958, the back of the main sanctuary was extended to accommodate a hall called the Jubilee hall. Further redevelopment of the cathedral has resulted in the Multi-Purpose Hall, as well as additional offices for the clergy and a studio apartment. Organ The pipe organ installed in the church is a secondhand one built in 1898 by Henry Willis, the famous English organ maker who also made the organ for St Paul's Cathedral in London and the original Grand Organ of the Royal Albert Hall. The organ was originally purchased by Frederic Duberly, the Federal Commissioner of Lands & Mines and the Acting Resident of Pahang for his personal use in 1898 at the cost ¬£381/12s,/8d. Duberly died of a heart attack on 3 April 1903, and his organ was packed up and shipped to Kuala Lumpur. In 1904, the organ was installed in St. Mary's and dedicated on 7 August 1904 but dismantled shortly after as the ownership of the organ had not passed to the church. It was only in 1915 when the church finally paid Duberly's executors the sum of $2,000 was the organ was finally installed in the north side of the church until 1926. In 1925 and 1926, the organ was badly damaged by two floods. It was repaired by an R. Myram and moved to its present position in the loft above the floor level. In 1927, Kuala Lumpur's sole organ builder, James A Riddell, rebuilt the organ and replaced most of the wooden pipes, the pedal board, the wind chest, and some of the keys. It was badly damaged again during the Second World War necessitating a complete rebuild in 1951, making the organ more Riddell than Willis by then. The fact that Riddell's work was reminiscent of Willis' work strongly suggests that Riddell might have been a former apprentice or journeyman of Henry Willis & Sons.History of the Pipe Organ of the Anglican Cathedral Church of St. Mary the Virgin by Andrew Hwang, 2012.

It was developed by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in collaboration with the Universit√§t Karlsruhe. The MEMO Model together with the photochemical dispersion model MARS are the two core models of the European zooming model (EZM). This model belongs to the family of models designed for describing atmospheric transport phenomena in the local-to-regional scale, frequently referred to as mesoscale air pollution models. History Initially, EZM was developed for modelling the transport and chemical transformation of pollutants in selected European regions in the frame of the EUROTRAC sub-project EUMAC and therefore it was formerly called the EUMAC Zooming Model (EUROTRAC, 1992). EZM has evolved to be one of the most frequently applied mesoscale air pollution model systems in Europe. It has already been successfully applied for various European airsheds including the Upper Rhine valley and the areas of Basel, Graz, Barcelona, Lisbon, Madrid, Milano, London, Cologne, Lyon, The Hague, Athens (Moussiopoulos, 1994; Moussiopoulos, 1995) and Thessaloniki.

Model equations  The prognostic mesoscale model MEMO describes the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer. In the present model version, air is assumed to be unsaturated. The model solves the continuity equation, the momentum equations and several transport equations for scalars (including the thermal energy equation and, as options, transport equations for water vapour, the turbulent kinetic energy and pollutant concentrations).  Transformation to terrain- following coordinates  The lower boundary of the model domain coincides with the ground. Because of the inhomogeneity of the terrain, it is not possible to impose boundary conditions at that boundary with respect to Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, a transformation of the vertical coordinate to a terrain-following one is performed. Hence, the originally irregularly bounded physical domain is mapped onto one consisting of unit cubes.  Numerical solution of the equation system  The discretized equations are solved numerically on a staggered grid, i.e. the scalar quantities \\\\rho, p and \\\\theta are defined at the cell centre while the velocity components u, v and w are defined at the centre of the appropriate interfaces. Temporal discretization of the prognostic equations is based on the explicit second order Adams- Bashforth scheme. There are two deviations from the Adams-Bashforth scheme: The first refers to the implicit treatment of the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation p_. To ensure non-divergence of the flow field, an elliptic equation is solved. The elliptic equation is derived from the continuity equation wherein velocity components are expressed in terms of p_. Since the elliptic equation is derived from the discrete form of the continuity equation and the discrete form of the pressure gradient, conservativity is guaranteed (Flassak and Moussiopoulos, 1988). The discrete pressure equation is solved numerically with a fast elliptic solver in conjunction with a generalized conjugate gradient method. The fast elliptic solver is based on fast Fourier analysis in both horizontal directions and Gaussian elimination in the vertical direction (Moussiopoulos and Flassak, 1989). The second deviation from the explicit treatment is related to the turbulent diffusion in vertical direction. In case of an explicit treatment of this term, the stability requirement may necessitate an unacceptable abridgement of the time increment. To avoid this, vertical turbulent diffusion is treated using the second order Crank‚ÄìNicolson method. On principle, advective terms can be computed using any suitable advection scheme. In the present version of MEMO, a 3D second-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD) scheme is implemented which is based on the 1D scheme proposed by Harten (1986). It achieves a fair (but not any) reduction of numerical diffusion, the solution being independent of the magnitude of the scalar (preserving transportivity).  Parameterizations  Turbulence and radiative transfer are the most important physical processes that have to be parameterized in a prognostic mesoscale model. In the MEMO model, radiative transfer is calculated with an efficient scheme based on the emissivity method for longwave radiation and an implicit multilayer method for shortwave radiation (Moussiopoulos 1987). The diffusion terms may be represented as the divergence of the corresponding fluxes. For turbulence parameterizations, K-theory is applied. In case of MEMO turbulence can be treated either with a zero-, one- or two-equation turbulence model. For most applications a one-equation model is used, where a conservation equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is solved.  Initial and boundary conditions  In MEMO, initialization is performed with suitable diagnostic methods: a mass-consistent initial wind field is formulated using an objective analysis model and scalar fields are initialized using appropriate interpolating techniques (Kunz, R., 1991). Data needed to apply the diagnostic methods may be derived either from observations or from larger scale simulations. Suitable boundary conditions have to be imposed for the wind velocity components u, v and w, the potential temperature \\\\theta and pressure p at all boundaries. At open boundaries, wave reflection and deformation may be minimized by the use of so-called radiation conditions (Orlanski 1976). According to the experience gained so far with the model MEMO, neglecting large scale environmental information might result in instabilities in case of simulations over longer time periods. For the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are used at lateral boundaries. With these conditions, the wind velocity component perpendicular to the boundary remains unaffected by the pressure change. At the upper boundary, Neumann boundary conditions are imposed for the horizontal velocity components and the potential temperature. To ensure non-reflectivity, a radiative condition is used for the hydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation p_h at that boundary. Hence, vertically propagating internal gravity waves are allowed to leave the computational domain (Klemp and Durran 1983). For the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, homogeneous staggered Dirichlet conditions are imposed. Being justified by the fact that nonhydrostatic effects are negligible at large heights, this condition is necessary, if singularity of the elliptic pressure equation is to be avoided in view of the Neumann boundary conditions at all other boundaries. The lower boundary coincides with the ground (or, more precisely, a height above ground corresponding to its aerodynamic roughness). For the non-hydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, inhomogeneous Neumann conditions are imposed at that boundary. All other conditions at the lower boundary follow from the assumption that the ‚ÄìObukhov similarity theory is valid. The one way interactive nesting facility is possible within MEMO. Thus, successive simulations on grids of increasing resolution are possible. During these simulations, the results of the application to a coarse grid are used as boundary conditions for the application to the finer grid (Kunz and Moussiopoulos, 1995).  Grid definition  The governing equations are solved numerically on a staggered grid. Scalar quantities as the temperature, pressure, density and also the cell volume are defined at the centre of a grid cell and the velocity components u, v and w at the centre of the appropriate interface. Turbulent fluxes are defined at different locations: Shear fluxes are defined at the centre of the appropriate edges of a grid cell and normal stress fluxes at scalar points. With this definition, the outgoing fluxes of momentum, mass, heat and also turbulent fluxes of a grid cell are identical to incoming flux of the adjacent grid cell. So the numerical method is conservative.  Topography and surface type  For calculations with MEMO, a file must be provided which contains orography height and surface type for each grid location The following surface types are distinguished and must be stored as percentage: * water (type: 1) * arid land (type: 2) * few vegetation (type: 3) * farmland (type: 4) * forest (type: 5) * suburban area (type: 6) * urban area (type: 7) Only surface types 1‚Äì6 have to be stored. Type 7 is the difference between 100% and the sum of types 1‚Äì6. If the percentage of a surface type is 100%, then write the number 10 and for all other surface types the number 99. The orography height is the mean height for each grid location above sea level in meter.  Meteorological data  The prognostic model MEMO is a set of partial differential equations in three spatial directions and in time. To solve these equations, information about the initial state in the whole domain and about the development of all relevant quantities at the lateral boundaries is required. =Initial state= To generate an initial state for the prognostic model, a diagnostic model (Kunz, R., 1991) is applied using measured temperature and wind data. Both data can be provided as: * surface measurements i.e. single measurements directly above the surface (not necessary) * upper air soundings (i.e., soundings that consist of two or more measurements at different heights) at a constant geographical location is required (with at least one sounding for temperature and wind velocity). =Time-dependent boundary conditions= Information about quantities at the lateral boundaries can be taken into account as surface measurements and upper air soundings. Therefore, a key word and the time when boundary data is given must occur in front of a set of boundary information.  Nesting facility  In MEMO, a one-way interactive nesting scheme is implemented. With this nesting scheme a coarse grid and a fine grid simulation can be nested. During the coarse grid simulation, data is interpolated and written to a file. A consecutive fine grid simulation uses this data as lateral boundary values.

Biochemistry Androstenedione Androstenedione is produced in the testis, as well as the adrenal cortex. Androstenedione is created from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or 17-hydroxyprogesterone. A deficiency in the HSD17B3 gene is characterized biochemically by decreased levels of testosterone and increased levels of androstenedione as a result of the defect in conversion of androstenedione into testosterone. This leads to a clinically important higher ratio of androstenedione to testosterone. Diagnosis In terms of the diagnosis of 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency the following should be taken into account: * Increased androstenedione:testosterone ratio * Thyroid dyshormonogenesis * Genetic testing Management The 2006 Consensus statement on the management of intersex disorders states that individuals with 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency have an intermediate risk of germ cell malignancy, at 28%, recommending that gonads be monitored.

Despite its appearance, it is not a member of the daisy family but rather a species of the Apiaceae (formerly Mackinlayaceae) family, the same family as the carrot. Its generic name, meaning \\"furnished with rays\\", is derived from the Greek stem aktin-/Œ±Œ∫œÑŒπŒΩ- \\"ray\\" or \\"spoke of a wheel\\" or \\"sunbeam\\", while its specific epithet is derived from its resemblance to the genus Helianthus. An iconic Sydney plant, its floral display has horticultural appeal which has seen limited use in the home garden and cut flower industry. It grows alongside the related lesser flannel flower (A. minor). Flowers and leaves seedhead Drummoyne, Sydney Description The flannel flower is generally a herbaceous shrub growing up to 50 cm (18 in) high, although rare specimens can be found to be 1.5 m (5 feet) high. The stem, branches and leaves of the plant are a pale grey in colour, covered in downy hair (rather like flannel in texture). The attractively lobed leaves are up to 10 cm (4 in) long and 7 cm (3 in) wide, with daisy-shaped flowerheads around 5 or occasionally 8 cm (2‚Äì3 in) in diameter. The bracts are cream to white in colour. Flowering occurs in spring and may be profuse after bushfires. Flannel flowers grow in sandstone heathland in coastal New South Wales and Queensland, and are commonly seen around the Sydney basin in spring. Cultivation Plants may be propagated by seed or cutting and grow in a well-drained sunny position, and are suitable for use in a rockery or cottage garden. The Mount Annan Botanic Garden has been involved in selecting and breeding cultivars for the home garden and the cut flower industry.von Richter, L. and C. Offord. (1998). Flannel Flowers. In: The New Rural Industries. (Ed. K.W. Hyde). p 505-511. (RIRDC: Canberra). One selection was named Actinotus 'Federation Star', and was chosen to be the New South Wales floral emblem for the Centenary of Federation (1901‚Äì2001). Popular culture The flannel flower is an iconic Sydney plant and has been used in imagery and art since colonial times. In St Bede's Church in the Sydney suburb of Drummoyne, the early 20th century work The Waratah Window by Alfred Handel depicts Australian native flowers, including the waratah, emblem of the state of New South Wales, and flannel flowers, Christmas bells and wattles. Flannel flowers are the emblem of the Sydney Bush Walkers' club established in 1927.

The Reich Federation of Jewish Front-Line Soldiers (, RJF) was an organization of German-Jewish soldiers founded in February 1919 by Leo L√∂wenstein in the aftermath of World War I to demonstrate Jewish loyalty to the former German Empire and German nationalism. History The goal of Reichsbund judischer Frontsoldaten was to stop the spread of antisemitic based on the argument that Jews were disloyal to the countries they lived in. In 1918, German antisemites claimed that the Jews had stabbed Germany in the back (Dolchstosslegende). The Reichsbund emphasized that 85,000 Jewish soldiers had fought for the German Empire in World War I, and 12,000 had died, which placed their loyalty to Germany beyond any reasonable doubt. Jews had received 30,000 medals and awards during the war. At its high point the Reichsbund had 55,000 members. The Reichsbund regarded the German Reich as the mother country of all German Jews. Its activities were outlawed by the Nazi government in 1936, and in 1938 it was dissolved. The RJF sees the basis of its work as complete allegiance to the German homeland. It does not have any goal or desire outside of this German homeland, and sharply rejects any movement which wishes to bring us German Jews to a position of outsiders in relation to this German homeland.Diaspora and Jewish Self-Understanding (in German): Der RJF sieht die Grundlage seiner Arbeit in einem restlosen Bekenntnis zur deutschen Heimat.

Early life Born in Highgate, London, she began dance classes at the age of four while attending Sherbourne Preparatory School, and by age eight was being taught by Phyllis Bedells. By the age of nine she had become the star pupil of her school, had been presented a silver medal by Tamara Karsavina and had passed all the examinations of the Royal Academy of Dancing it was possible for her to take. Her talent was recognised by Ursula Moreton and Ninette de Valois, who offered her a scholarship for four years at the age of ten, with the option of joining their dance company for a further four years. She began to attend the Sadler's Wells School in 1937.Fisher, Hugh. Beryl Grey. Adam and Charles Black: London (1955), pp. 5-21 Career In August 1941, she was taken into the company at the age of fourteen and joined them during a provincial tour, at Burnley. Her first appearance with the company was in the corps de ballet of Le Lac des Cygnes. She progressed through the company at a steady rate. Her first solo role was as one of the Blue Skaters in Frederick Ashton's Les Patineurs. Her first lead role was as the Serving Maid in The Gods Go A-Begging \\"with a charm and style remarkable for a child of fourteen and a half\\". On her fifteenth birthday, Dame Ninette de Valois gave her an inscribed copy of Gordon Anthony's book on Dame Margot Fonteyn and the opportunity of dancing Odette-Odile in the full-length Le Lac des Cygnes. In 1942, Robert Helpmann created the first role for her in his second ballet The Birds where she was The Nightingale. In April 1943, she created her first dramatic role as Duessa in Ashton's ballet, The Quest, which was based on Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene. On 1 March 1944, she first portrayed the main role of Giselle in Derby. She then performed the role in London for the first time on her seventeenth birthday. Grey is also known for her interpretation of Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis, which she first performed in 1946. She first performed the role of Princess Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty on 20 June 1946 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. From 1957 until the mid-1960s, Grey was an international guest ballerina across Europe, South America, Australasia, the Far East, the United States and Canada. In 1957, she became the first English dancer to appear as guest ballerina with the Kirov and Bolshoi Ballet.

Wikia Search followed other experiments by Wikia into search engine technology and officially launched as a \\"public alpha\\" on January 7, 2008. The roll-out version of the search interface was widely criticized by reviewers in mainstream media. History On December 23, 2006, Wales made a passing comment regarding the possibility of a wiki-based internet search. The result was extensive media coverage in multiple languages, in outlets like The Guardian, the Sydney Morning Herald, and online editions of Forbes and Business Week publishing the statement as an announcement, encouraging the company to re-brand and relaunch its previous search engine proposal under the temporary name of \\"Search Wikia\\". In a later interview, Wales attempted to clarify several issues. He said that funding received from Amazon.com was not specific to the search project and also restated that Wikia and wikipedia have separate management, even though they shared three key stakeholders. When asked whether the project was \\"formally announced\\", he said it was partly planned and partly a response to news coverage. On January 31, 2007, at a talk given at New York University, Wales announced that Wikia plans to build a search engine rivaling those of Google and Yahoo based on the kind of collaborative cooperation which has been so successful in developing wikipedia, arguing that \\"search should be open, transparent, participatory, and democratic.\\"Wales: Search Wikia Will Succeed Where Google Cannot, InformationWeek, February 5, 2007. Retrieved July 27, 2007. He later suggested this new approach could account for five percent of the search market.wikipedia founder says to challenge Google, Yahoo, Reuters, March 8, 2007. Retrieved June 1, 2018. On March 10, 2007, Gil Penchina, chief executive officer of Wikia, stated in an interview that the goal for the project is to get five percent of the search market and that a release date for services was not scheduled. \\"We're really trying to build a movement to make search free and open and transparent,\\" Penchina said. \\"We have some servers up and people are hacking away.\\" The free and open-source approach of utilizing programmers and users around the world is different from that used by major search providers such as Google and Yahoo, who keep most of their code secret, and could provide a search engine that lets users edit and fine tune its results.Jonathan Thaw, Wikia plans editable Web search engine, Bloomberg News, March 10, 2007 On December 24, 2007, Wales announced that Wikia Search had entered \\"private pre-alpha\\". On June 3, 2008, an upgraded version of Wikia Search was released with additional features such as improved screen display and facilities for users to rate, edit and enhance the search results. In particular, it offered users the possibility of adding pertinent URLs to the results displayed and deleting any misleading results with immediate effect.Wikia Search opens its doors, Heise Online, June 6, 2008. The improvements were widely welcomed by a number of former critics. In August 2008 Wikia Search launched an official version of the Wikia toolbar that can be downloaded and added on to the Firefox browser. In October 2008, WISE ‚Äì Wikia Intelligent Search Extensions was released. By August 2008, Wikia Search held a 0.000079% share of the search market in the U.S., compared with Google's 70.77%.Wikia Search, Cuil trailing Google by a long shot, Network World, August 19, 2008 While Google was conducting experiments with page ranking based on user feedback around this time, Jimmy Wales stated that Google's random tests and its closed algorithm were different from the open, community-oriented crowdsourcing attempts of Wikia Search. In March 2009, the project ended: \\"... Wikia Search was not making its numbers. With only 10,000 unique users a month over the past six months, Wales said, it was hard to justify the resources being put into it.\\"Wales giving up on Wikia Search As of April 16, 2009, the site was running, but with \\"So long and thanks for all the fish! Have a specific question? Try wikianswers!\\" near the bottom of the page. Finally on May 14, 2009, the search engine service was brought to a halt. Queries to the Wikia Search website were redirected, with a message in part stating \\"The Wikia Search project has ended.\\" Search engine= Features = The search engine's result pages provided access to three major components: * a web search engine, * a social network service and * a wiki, which hosts so-called mini-articles Mini-articles A prominent feature of the search engine were the human-written mini articles. Mini articles were short articles about the topics given by their title. They were hosted by a Wikia wiki. Whenever a search query is issued with mini in front, the results page looked in the wiki for a mini article with a name that matched the search query. If no matching article existed, the search user was given the opportunity to write a new one. Social network The user interface was tied in with a social network application, called \\"foowi\\". Users could create an account for the application and fill in a profile. The system linked the wiki login to the social network login. Profile functions include Status, Basic profile, White board, Albums, Friends, Personal and Work. Web search engine The web search engine consisted of the following components: * Crawler(s) (Grub), * Indices, the search engine proper (three selectable indices, by default an index that uses Nutch) * and browser based results presentation (written in JavaScript). The results presentation used XML- formatted requests to query the index. The XML format is called \\"Open Index and can be used to query indices other than the one at Internet Systems Consortium (ISC). The results presentation once included an option to select a different index to be used (out of three). In early 2009, Yahoo! BOSS was being used as the back-end. =Organization= The servers that implemented the web search engine's default index were owned and operated by the ISC. Although the index servers were donated to ISC, the index server's domain name still remains the one of the Wikia Search software labs,The JavaScript code that fetches search results from the index server directly refers to the current index servers. The search engine's main page and result pages themselves were served by Wikia (note that the result pages' content was retrieved from the index server at \`swlabs.org\`, not from \`wikia.com\`). The social network, like the results presentation, was hosted by Wikia. Search Wikia, the wiki which hosted the mini articles, is hosted by Wikia. The wiki's content is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL). Although formally owned by Wikia, Wikia's management have stated that they want the wiki's user community to govern the wiki, as is custom with Wikia wikis in general.

It dates from the late 16th-century, it being constructed several years after the death of Luria, a great kabbalist who arrived in Safed in 1570. The synagogue is known for its colorful and ornate Holy Ark. It may be the oldest synagogue in Israel that is still in use. Though the synagogue is associated by name with the Ashkenazi community, today it serves as a place of worship for Hasidic and Sephardic Jews and remains popular among worshippers of different affiliations. Another ancient Safed synagogue dedicated to Rabbi Isaac Luria is known as the Sephardic Ari Synagogue. History The synagogue was established by Sephardic immigrants from Greece who arrived in Safed during the sixteenth century. When Rabbi Isaac Luria arrived in 1570, he prayed in this synagogue on the eve of the Shabbat. During the service, he was accustomed to leave the synagogue with his disciples and walk to a nearby field to welcome the Sabbath. Alternatively, this was at the time a forested area at the margin of Safed, and the ARI used to welcome the Sabbath in these forests. The Ari-Ashkenazi Shul, on AscentOfSafed.com The Ari's tradition of welcoming the Sabbath during Kabbalat Shabbat is still echoed in Jewish communities around the world during the singing of Lecha Dodi, when worshippers turn toward the entrance of the synagogue to \\"greet\\" the sabbath. In the eighteenth century, with the arrival of the Hasidim from Eastern Europe, the synagogue came to serve the Ashkenazi community. The synagogue was destroyed in the Galilee earthquake of 1837, and was rebuilt 20 years later. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War a bomb is said to have fallen in the courtyard. Shrapnel flew into the synagogue while it was packed with people seeking shelter, yet miraculously no one was hurt. This event is one of many miracles said to have taken place in Safed. Description A Hebrew inscription above the entrance lintel reads: \\"How awe-inspiring is this place, the synagogue of the Ari of blessed memory.\\" The Holy Ark was carved from olive wood by a craftsman from Galicia, in the style of the synagogues of Eastern Europe. It includes an anthropomorphic image of a lion, alluding to Rabbi Luria's acronym Ari, which means lion.

She appeared in vaudeville and later in motion pictures, before becoming a noted fashion designer. Career Montgomery was born in Sikeston, Missouri, on May 27, 1912. As a young girl she was in a group of traveling vaudeville players of the Junior Times Club in Los Angeles, California. Accompanied by truckloads of ice cream, Montgomery and the others entertained children at hospitals. In May 1924 she performed as an eccentric dancer at the Orthopedic and Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. In 1925 Montgomery entered the Mary Pickford silhouette contest which selected a lookalike of America's sweetheart. Other aspiring young actresses like Virginia Davis, Cecilia Parker, and Mary Kestner, also submitted photos. As a seventeen-year-old Hollywood High School student, Montgomery acted the part of a maid in the stage play Bad Babies. An attorney for the California State Department of Industrial Relations ruled that the theme of the production was too risque for a minor actress to appear in. Montgomery was required to wait until her eighteenth birthday in 1930 to participate. She became upset over the ruling. Her mother, Mrs. Marie Cleveland, hired a private tutor so that Montgomery would comply with the Los Angeles, California compulsory school laws. An understudy, Dorothy Gould, took over the role. Montgomery's film career as an actress was quite brief. She has an uncredited role as a student in Freshman Year (1938). =Designing= Montgomery started out designing and manufacturing attractive cotton dresses in the mid-1920s. By 1940 she was noted for her designs in cotton and for having promoted bare-midriff beachwear and bathing costumes for several seasons. In 1953 Montgomery stated that she had 28 years of experience to her name. In 1965 she was described as one of the \\"great\\" and \\"traditional\\" Californian designers.

It is an endemic resident breeder in coastal bush, open forest, gardens and fynbos in western and southern South Africa. This species nests mainly in the southern spring from September to November. The nest is thick walled cup concealed by foliage in a small tree or shrub. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Cape bulbul in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He used the French name Le merle brun du Cap de Bonne Esp√©rance and the Latin Merula Fusca Capitis Bonae Spei. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Cape bulbul. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Turdus capensis and cited Brisson's work. The specific name capensis denotes the Cape of Good Hope. This species is now placed in the genus Pycnonotus that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826. The Cape bulbul is considered to belong to a superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-eared bulbul, white- spectacled bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, and the common bulbul. Alternate names for the Cape bulbul include the Cape geelgat and two names used for other species (common and dark-capped bulbul). Description The Cape bulbul is long, mainly dull, blackish brown with a diagnostic white eye-ring, and yellow undertail coverts. The head has a small crest. The short, straight bill, legs and feet are black and the iris is dark brown. The sexes are similar in plumage. This species is much darker than the other South African bulbuls, and differs in the eye ring colour and brown lower belly, whereas the other dark bulbuls have a pale lower belly. The dark belly helps to identify juveniles, which lack the distinctive eye ring of the adult. The most typical call of this species is a liquid whistle of two or more varied notes pit-peet- pitmajol, piet-piet-patata. Behaviour and ecology The Cape bulbul is a common and conspicuous bird, which tends to perch at the top of a bush. It is active and noisy, usually seen in pairs or small groups foraging for fruit, nectar and insects. In part of its range, it gets parasitized by the Jacobin cuckoo.

Christian foreign missionaries are not allowed to proselytize or perform religious activities without government approval. Vietnam nowadays, however, has been sending missionaries overseas.  Catholicism = Foundation period = In 10th century, some 'Nestorian' Christian priests had visited Annam (name of Vietnam at the time). The first Catholic missionaries visited Vietnam from Portugal and Spain in the 16th century. In 1524, Portuguese merchant Duarte Coelho's fleet arrived H·ªôi An, central Vietnam to trade, bringing along Catholic missionaries.Encounter and cultural influences of the Portuguese and French in Vietnamese history from XVI to XIX century, University of Hu·∫ø A missionary named I-n√™-khu arrived in Nam ƒê·ªãnh, northern Vietnam in 1533. The earliest missions did not bring very impressive results. Only after the arrival of Jesuits in the first decades of the 17th century did Christianity begin to establish its positions within the local populations in both regions of ƒê√†ng Ngo√†i (Tonkin) and ƒê√†ng Trong (Cochinchina or Quinan). These missionaries were mainly Italians, Portuguese, and Japanese. Two priests Francesco Buzomi and Diogo Carvalho established the first Catholic community in H·ªôi An in 1615. Between 1627‚Äì30, Avignonese Alexandre de Rhodes and Portuguese Pero Marques converted more than 6,000 people in Tonkin. These Jesuit activities were not always welcomed by the two rival governments of Vietnam. In May 1630, lord Tr·ªãnh Tr√°ng of Tonkin issued order to expel the Jesuits. In 1639, some Japanese Christians in H·ªôi An assisted for a revolt against the government, so lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Lan of Cochinchina ordered the Jesuits to leave his domain. In the early 17th century, Jesuit missionaries including Francisco de Pina, Gaspar do Amaral, Antonio Barbosa, and de Rhodes developed an alphabet for the Vietnamese language, using the Latin script with added diacritic marks. This writing system continues to be used today, and is called ch·ªØ Qu·ªëc ng·ªØ (literally \\"national language script\\"). Meanwhile, the traditional ch·ªØ N√¥m, in which Girolamo Maiorica was an expert, was the main script conveying Catholic faith to Vietnamese until the late 19th century. The martyrdom and funeral of Jean-Louis Bonnard (d. 1852), one of the Vietnamese Martyr Saints. Since the late 17th century, French missionaries of the Foreign Missions Society and Spanish missionaries of the Dominican Order were gradually taking the role of evangelisation in Vietnam. Other missionaries active in pre-modern Vietnam were Franciscans (in Cochinchina), Italian Dominicans & Discalced Augustinians (in Eastern Tonkin), and those sent by the Propaganda Fide. =Modern period = The French missionary and Titular Bishop of Adran Pierre Pigneau de Behaine, who had come to evangelize in Cochinchina, played a role in Vietnamese history towards the end of the 18th century.Hall, p. 423.Cady, p. 282.Buttinger, p. 266.Mantienne, p. 520.McLeod, p. 7.Karnow, p. 75. Pigneau would ingratiate himself to and eventually become confidant to Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, the last of the Nguy·ªÖn lords, then engaged in a civil war.Buttinger, p. 234. Pigneau hoped that with a Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh victory, he would gain concessions for the Catholic Church in Vietnam.McLeod, p. 9. A recent study suggests that his contribution to √Ånh's succeed was not as it was conventionally believed to have been. In August 1798, Emperor C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh of T√¢y S∆°n regime in Hu·∫ø, suspected the Catholic civilian in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã supported and allied with his enemy Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, who tolerates Christianity, ordered soldiers did a pogrom against the Catholics. More than 10,000 Catholic civilians in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã were massacred, as known as the Marian apparition of La Vang.The shrine of Our Lady of La Vang Pigneau and other missionaries bought military supplies and enlisted European soldiers for Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh and took part in military operations.McLeod, p. 10.Cady, p. 284.Hall, p. 431.Mantienne, p.135Karnow, p. 77.Buttinger, p. 267.Karnow, p. 78. Nguyen conquered Vietnam and became Emperor Gia Long. He tolerated the Catholic faith and permitted unimpeded missionary activities out of respect to his foreign benefactors.Buttinger, pp. 241, 311. Missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions.Cady, p. 408. At the time of Gia Long's death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina.Cady, p. 409. This success would not last, however.Buttinger, p. 268. Seeking to limit Catholic influence, Gia Long appointed Minh M·∫°ng his successor for his deeply conservative Confucianism; his first son's lineage had converted to Catholicism and abandoned their Confucian heritage.Buttinger, p. 269. A power struggle developed between Minh M·∫°ng and pro-Catholic, pro- Western officials who wanted to maintain the power they had been given by Gia Long.Choi, pp. 56-57McLeod, p. 24. Eventually, 2,000 Vietnamese Catholic troops fought under the command of Father Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T√¢m in an attempt to depose Minh M·∫°ng and install a Catholic \\"emperor\\".McLeod, p.31 The revolt was put down, and restrictions were placed on Catholicism. Persistent rebellions occurred throughout the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty, many led by Catholic priests intent on installing a Christian monarch. During the French colonial campaign against Vietnam from 1858 to 1883, many Catholics joined with the French in helping to establish colonialism by fighting against the Vietnamese government. Once colonial rule was established, the Catholics were rewarded with preferential treatment in government posts, education, and the church was given vast tracts of royal land that had been seized. After the victorious overthrow of French rule and Vietnam's temporary division in the mid-1950s, Catholicism declined in the North, where the Communists categorized it as a reactionary force opposed to both national liberation as well as social progress. In the South, by contrast, Catholicism was expanded under the presidency of Ngo Dinh Diem, who aggressively promoted it, through coercion and violence, as an important \\"bulwark\\" against North Vietnam. Diem, whose brother was Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc, gave extra rights to the Catholic Church, dedicated the nation to the Virgin Mary, and preferentially promoted Catholic military officers and public servants while severely restricting the practice of Buddhism and allowing Catholic paramilitaries to demolish sacred Buddhist temples and pagodas. In 1955, approximately 600,000 Catholics remained in the North after an estimated 650,000 had fled to the South in Operation Passage to Freedom. Notre Dame Cathedral, Saigon. In 1975, after the withdrawal of US troops Communist authorities re-united the country by military force and claimed that the religious activities of Roman Catholics were stabilized and that there was no religious persecution. Meanwhile, the Government acted to isolate and neutralize hard-core opposition within local Catholics to party policy and to persuade less strongly opposed factions to join a party-controlled \\"renovation and reconciliation\\" movement. A significant number of Vietnamese Roman Catholics, however, remained opposed to communist authority. Since ƒê·ªïi m·ªõi reforms, the Vietnamese government alternates its treatment of Roman Catholics. In 1980, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Vietnam was established. In 1988, 117 Catholics, representing hundred thousands of Vietnamese Martyrs who had died for their faith, were canonized by Pope John Paul II.  Protestantism  A Baptist church in Ho Chi Minh city. Protestantism was introduced in 1911 at Da Nang by Canadian missionary Robert A. Jaffray. As part of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, over 100 missionaries were sent to Vietnam, assisting the faith's growth in the country. By 1967, a number of Protestant communities were represented, mainly within South Vietnam. These communities included the French Reformed Church, Anglican-Episcopalian, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Baptists, Church of Christ, Worldwide Evangelization Crusade, and Seventh-day Adventists. Other Protestant associations were also represented in some social services and welfare agencies. In 1967 there were 150,000 Protestant adherents in South Vietnam, representing about 1% of the total population. Protestant communities in the North decreased in membership to about 1,200 by the end of the Vietnam War. Several Protestant church properties were confiscated during the communist takeover of South Vietnam in 1975. In the early 1980s, Protestants were mostly located in the Montagnard communities in southern Vietnam's central highlands. Present estimates of the number of Protestants range from the official government figure of 500,000 to claims by churches of 1,600,000 or more. The two officially recognized Protestant churches are the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV), recognized in 2001, and the smaller Evangelical Church of Vietnam North (ECVN), recognized since 1963. The SECV has affiliated churches in the southern provinces of the country. By some estimates, the growth of Protestant believers in Vietnam has been as much as 600 percent over the past ten years. Some of the new converts belong to unregistered evangelical house churches. Based on believers' estimates, two- thirds of Protestants are members of ethnic minorities, including Hmong, Dzao, Thai, and other minority groups in the Northwest Highlands, and members of ethnic minority groups of the Central Highlands (Ede, Jarai, Bahnar, and Koho, among others). At least 50% of the current Protestant population are tribal people, but the Government's treatments toward them is varied. The tribal Protestant people in Northern Vietnam do not face Government persecution, but the Protestant southern tribe, notably Hmong and H're tribal groups suffer from particular persecution. In May 2006, over 300 Montagnard people remained in Vietnamese prisons for their faith. A young Hroi (ethnic minority) man who refused to reject his Christian faith reportedly died from injuries received while under official interrogation in April 2007. By the 2008 estimates of Release International, many Christians from Vietnam's tribal highlands are still regarded as enemies and targeted as \\"agents of America\\". They are reportedly beaten, tortured and starved behind bars, despite the official claims and guarantees for freedom of religion. Mennonite and Baptist movements were officially recognized by Hanoi in October 2007, which was seen as some improvement of religious freedom in the country. Pastor Nguyen Quang Trung, provisional president of the Mennonite Church in Vietnam, taking part in the official ceremony of the above authorisation, quoted his Church's motto: \\"Living the Gospel, worshipping God, and serving the nation.\\".  Bible translations  Seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries first proclaimed the Gospel in Vietnamese language. Girolamo Maiorica compiled the first ch·ªØ N√¥m catechism (Thi√™n Ch√∫a th√°nh gi√°o kh·∫£i m√¥ng Â§©‰∏ªËÅñÊïôÂïüËíô) in 1623, and Alexandre de Rhodes printed the first texts in ch·ªØ Qu·ªëc ng·ªØ, including a bilingual catechism, in Rome 1651. However, the Bible was not systematically translated. Some portions of the Bible may have been translated and printed in Thailand in 1872. Jean Bonet, author of a Dictionnaire Annamite-fran√ßais, translated Gospel of Luke from French to Vietnamese in 1890. The first translation from Latin was that of Albert Schlicklin (1916), and the first from Greek that of William Cadman (New Testament 1923, Old Testament 1934).History of the Vietnamese Bible The Schilicklin and Cadman Bibles remain the basis of the standard Catholic and Protestant versions today. The organized work of United Bible Societies in Vietnam began in 1890. In 1966 the Vietnamese Bible Society was established. These societies distributed 53,170 copies of the Bible and 120,170 copies of the New Testament in Vietnamese within the country in 2005. In 2017 Jehovah's Witnesses released the entire New World Translation of the Bible in Vietnamese. Eastern Orthodoxy Orthodoxy in Vietnam is presented by a parish of Russian Orthodox Church in Vungtau, where there are many Russian-speaking employees of the Russian-Vietnamese Joint Venture \\"Vietsovpetro\\". The parish named after Our Lady of Kazan icon was opened in 2002 with the blessing of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, which had been given in Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. The representatives of foreign relations department of the Russian Orthodox Church from time to time come to Vungtau for conducting Orthodox divine service.  Persecution  The historical treatment of Christians in Vietnam has varied over time due to historical, tribal or political forces, both internal and external of the Vietnamese nation. Vietnam's history is particularly tumultuous, and does not reflect how current Vietnam is today. In the 16th and early 17th centuries during the Later L√™ dynasty, Christians were tolerated. The level of tolerance, however, started to change when the Tr·ªãnh lords and Nguy·ªÖn lords divided the country. In particular, the Tr·ªãnh Lords were more hostile against the Christians and expelled Christian missionaries out the country.http://www.vietnam-culture.com/articles-111-16/Christianity.aspx In contrast, their Nguy·ªÖn rivals were more tolerant of Christians, though not without skepticism.https://asiasociety.org/education/religion-vietnam This resulted in more Christians in the south than in the north of Vietnam, a situation that continued from 17th century onward. Prince Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, who later became Emperor Gia Long and founded the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty from the remnant of old Nguy·ªÖn lords, was particularly tolerant of Christians.http://www.advite.com/APrinceAMissionary.htm However, persecution on Christians increased with the death of Gia Long, when successive Nguy·ªÖn emperors imprisoned, murdered and oppressed Christianshttp://www.agu.edu.vn:8080/bitstream/AGU_Library/2719/1/Nguyen%20Thi%20Ngoc%20Tho.pdf Brutal treatment of Christians by the Nguy·ªÖn rulers induced French military action in 1858 and ultimately the French conquest of Vietnam. Although many pre-20th century rebellions against France sought to unify Vietnamese regardless of faith, many Vietnamese Christians supported France. During the French protectorate, the French authority favored Christians and oppressed non-Christians in the country.http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/15.htm This biased treatment by France united non-Christians, and created particular hostility between the Buddhists of Vietnam and the French colonial government and its Christian allies.https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=55a303b662274da3ac9abcd4e90e2387 The Vi·ªát Minh, who would eventually ally with Communist power, were hostile against those did not support independence of Vietnam. Many Vietnamese Christians possessed pro-French sentiment, which led to their persecution as a by-product of anti-colonial sentiment expressed by the Vi·ªát Minh, and was not necessarily religious persecution.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.899.948&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf In the aftermath of the First Indochina War, many Christians fled Communist rule in the north, further increasing the Christian population of South Vietnam.https://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-01/vietnamese-diaspora South Vietnam's President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám however continued to antagonize non- Christians, empowering Christians in the military and civil service and beginning systematic repression of non-Christian, particularly Buddhist, religious practice.https://alphahistory.com/vietnamwar/south-vietnam/ Many officials in South Vietnam's Government were Christians and they were given exclusive power. This resulted in the Buddhist crisis and eventually, the overthrow of his represssive Christian-dominated Government.https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/jfk-in-history/vietnam- diem-the-buddhist-crisis However, this didn't eliminate the influence of Christians across the South and Christians continued to dominate social- political life in the South until 1975. After 1975, the Communists began to prohibit religious practice, but particularly targeted Christians. Many Vietnamese boat people were Christians, and Christians formed 75% of Vietnamese refugees fleeing the country.https://academic.oup.com/rsq/article- abstract/26/2/57/1681678?redirectedFrom=PDF This resulted in a Western- oriented Vietnamese diaspora still relevant today, as many Vietnamese emigrants in Western Europe, Canada and the United States, belong to Christian sects and heavily oppose Communist rule; by contrast, the Vietnamese diaspora in Eastern Europe is more Buddhist-influenced. Since ƒê·ªïi m·ªõi reforms of 1986, Christianity has started to see revival, but the Communist government's policies toward Christians are difficult for many Christians and sometimes dangerous. Christians continue to be seen as a threat due to their previous support for the French and Americans. Terrorism against Christians in the country has been a major issue, and oppression of Christians is still commonly practiced by the Communist authorities.https://www.christianpost.com/news/vietnam-christians-beaten- arrested-refusing-worship-buddha.htmlhttps://thediplomat.com/2017/11/vietnam- wrestles-with-christianity/https://www.opendoorsusa.org/christian- persecution/world-watch-list/vietnam/ On the other hand, the government has lifted some restrictions on religious practices.https://www.roughguides.com/destinations/asia/vietnam/festivals-and- religious-events/ In particular, Christians can celebrate holidays like Easter, Thanksgiving and gathering in Churches are common among Christians.https://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/a-guide-to- spending-christmas-in-vietnam/ Vietnam is now maintaining a semi-formal relation with the Vatican, a major breakthrough in contrast to other communist countries of China, Laos and North Korea. The Government of Vietnam reached an agreement with Vatican for a further normalization in 2018, which allowed Holy See to have a permanent representative in Vietnam in the future.

Career By the end of his career, he had thirteen World Cup wins to his credit, the most by any skier in Canadian history during that time period. He placed in the top three positions in twenty-nine World Cup events, as well as numerous top ten finishes. Bulau earned his thirteen World Cup victories at various hill sizes from 1981 to 1983 when he finished 3rd (1981), 3rd (1982), and 2nd (1983) in the overall World Cup standings. His junior world championship in 1979 was the first Nordic title by a Canadian. Bulau is a 4-time Olympian, as he participated in the 1980 (Lake Placid, USA), 1984 (Sarajevo, Yugoslavia), 1988 (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) and 1992 (Albertville, France) Winter Olympics.

History The house is thought to have been built by James Wyatt, almost certainly for James William Steuart, a farmer, in around 1787. It was acquired by Sir Charles Decimus Crosley, a former Sheriff of London from the Steuart family in 1859. It then passed to Sir James Thompson Mackenzie, 1st Baronet in 1883, to Major William James Joicey, the then serving High Sheriff of Durham, in 1890 and to Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen, an industrialist, in 1930. Northcote House accommodated the Civil Defence College from 1950 until it closed in 1968. The Civil Service College was then established in the building in June 1970. The ill-fated Sunningdale Agreement on power-sharing in Northern Ireland was signed in Northcote House on 9 December 1973. The Civil Service College evolved to become the National School of Government, which provided training, organisational development and consultancy courses for UK civil servants and private individual learners until its closure in March 2012.National School of Government accessed 19 June 2012 In March 2015, the College of Policing opened an office in the Albert Day building.College of Policing accessed 16 October 2016 Sunningdale Park was then sold to Audley Retirement and Berkeley Homes in December 2016. Architecture In grounds of there is a Grade II listed neo-Georgian mansion called Northcote House, which was built in 1930, and in which notable features include the grand staircase and front portico.

He was born in Genoa and trained with his father Agostino Calvi and Perin del Vaga. Older sources claim he lived till the improbable age of 105 years Biography by Lanzi His elder brother Pantaleone (died 1595) was also a painter. They worked together at Genoa and the different cities of the republic, as well as at Monaco and Naples. Pantaleono acting as the decorator for Luzzato‚Äôs works. They painted a fa√ßade of the Palazzo Doria (now Palazzo Spinola). They painted a Continence of Scipio for a palace in Genoa. Lazzaro, irritated by the success of some of his contemporaries, prompted him to the commission the poisoning of Giacomo Bargone; and he hired persons to vilify the works of the ablest painters of the time, and to extol his own. While engaged in these schemes, he was engaged to paint the Birth and Life of St. John the Baptist, together with Andrea Semini and Luca Cambiaso, for the chapel of the Nobili Centurioni. Lazzaro was so mortified at this challenge, that he became a mariner, and withdrew himself from painting for twenty years. He returned, however, to his profession, which he continued till he was in his 85th year. His last works were for the church of Santa Cattaprina.M. Bryan Pantaleone's sons: Aurelio, Marcantonio, Benedetto, and Felice; also became painters. Of these, Marcantonio Calvi was the most distinguished painting with his brothers decorations in palazzo Doria, and by himself in Pegli, San Pietro d'Ancona, and other palaces of Liguria, including the loggia degli Spinola. He then moved to Venice. The brothers painted in the Convent of Gesu e Maria in Genoa, and in the church of Santa Caterina.Boni, page 171 References * * Notes Category:1512 births Category:1603 deaths Category:People from Genoa Category:16th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Genoese painters Category:Italian Renaissance painters Category:Italian decorators ","title":"Lazzaro Calvi"},{"id":"10347210","text":"\\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\" is a rock song written by Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. It was first recorded by Paul Revere & the Raiders and appeared on their album Midnight Ride, released in May 1966. The song is simple musically, with a repeating verse chord progression of E major, G major, A major, and C major, and a repeating bridge in cut time of E major, G major, A major, and G major. Monkees version It is best known as a hit for The Monkees (US #20), released in November 1966, (making it the first Monkees B-side to chart).Whitburn, Joel, Top Pop Singles 1955‚Äì1996, ¬©1997 Record Research Inc. Musicians featured on the Monkees recording are: Micky Dolenz (lead vocal); Tommy Boyce (backing vocal); Wayne Erwin and Gerry McGee (rhythm guitar); Louis Shelton (lead guitar); Bobby Hart (Vox Continental organ); Larry Taylor (bass); Billy Lewis (drums); and Henry Lewy (percussion). The various Monkees' versions differ across the single, stereo album, and mono album versions. In the stereo version, the track's title is sung just before the second verse, whereas on the single and mono album versions, this segment is left instrumental. Additionally, the stereo version has an edit in the fade out. The mono album version does not have this edit and therefore has a longer coda. The single also does not have the edit, but it fades the song earlier than the mono album. All Monkees' hits compilations through the mid-1980s used the stereo version, and afterward typically used the single version. Other versions The song has been covered by many artists. Among the more notable is Modern Rocketry's version in 1983, which reached number 7 on the U.S. Hot Dance/Disco chart; and PJ & Duncan's version in 1996, which reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. Punk bands, The Sex Pistols, State of Alert and Minor Threat also have recorded versions of the song.

A spinner is typically oriented vertically. In most cases holding a button down causes the speed at which the associated value changes to increase. Usually, the value of the spinner is displayed in a text box next to the spinner, allowing the user to use the spinner to adjust the value, or to type the value into the text box. The combination of spinner and text box was coined as a Value Box. A spinner is different from a scrollbar or slider in that a spinner is typically used to adjust a value without changing the format of the display or the other information on the screen. Thus, the appearance of the spinner at a given time does not represent the quantity of the associated value.

Southern Africa is defined as Africa south of a line between the Kunene and Zambezi rivers, encompassing Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, mainland South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland and southern and central Mozambique, as well as oceanic waters within of the coast, covering approximately 3.5 million square kilometres. Traditional boundaries In Layard's 1867 treatise on the regional avifauna, he arbitrarily defined \\"South Africa\\" as the region south of 28¬∞ South. Sharpe's 1884 revision of Layard's work extended the boundary to the Cuanza and Zambezi rivers, believing that the latter is a natural avifaunal limit. Stark and Sclater, possibly influenced by national boundaries determined at the Berlin Conference, substituted the Cuanza with the Kunene River for the first of their volumes, which appeared in 1900. The latter definition became entrenched with many ornithological publications following suit. Regional habitats Southern Africa consists of eight major habitats: the Karoo, moist savannah, arid savannah, the Namib Desert, lowland forest, fynbos, grassland and montane forest. Taxonomy This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of Austin Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa 7th edition. The family accounts of the respective headers, and the species counts per family, reflect this taxonomy. Introduced, accidental, and extirpated species are included in the total species counts for Southern Africa. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. * Accidental: - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Southern Africa * Endemic: - a species endemic to Southern Africa *Extirpated: - a species that no longer occurs in Southern Africa though populations exist elsewhere *Introduced: - a species introduced to Southern Africa as a direct or indirect consequence of human actions *Data deficient: - a species with uncertain status due to lack of research or available information Penguins Order: SphenisciformesFamily: Spheniscidae The number of penguin species is a matter of debate. Depending on the authority, biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living species. Four species occur in Southern Africa, though only one is resident or a breeder. * African penguin, Spheniscus demersus * King penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus - accidental * Macaroni penguin, Eudyptes chrysolophus - accidental * Rockhopper penguin, Eudyptes chrysocome - accidental Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and three species occur in Southern Africa. * Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis * Great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus * Black- necked grebe, Podiceps nigricollis Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses comprise between 13 and 24 species (the number of species is still a matter of some debate, 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in 4 genera. The four genera are the great albatrosses (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific albatrosses (Phoebastria), and the sooty albatrosses or sooties (Phoebetria). Of the four genera, the North Pacific albatrosses are considered a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks. * Tristan albatross, Diomedea dabbenena * Wandering albatross, Diomedea exulans * Southern royal albatross, Diomedea epomophora * Northern royal albatross, Diomedea sanfordi * Shy albatross, Thalassarche cauta * Black-browed albatross, Thalassarche melanophris * Atlantic yellow- nosed albatross, Thalassarche chlororhynchos * Grey-headed albatross, Thalassarche chrysostoma * Salvin's albatross, Thalassarche salvini * Chatham albatross, Thalassarche eremita * Buller's albatross, Thalassarche bulleri - accidental * Indian yellow-nosed albatross, Thalassarche carteri * Light- mantled albatross, Phoebetria palpebrata - accidental * Sooty albatross, Phoebetria fusca - accidental * Laysan albatross, Phoebastria immutabilis - accidental Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The Procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. * Southern giant petrel, Macronectes giganteus * Northern giant petrel, Macronectes halli * Southern fulmar, Fulmarus glacialoides * Antarctic petrel, Thalassoica antarctica - accidental * Pintado petrel, Daption capense * Great-winged petrel, Pterodroma macroptera * White-headed petrel, Pterodroma lessonii * Atlantic petrel, Pterodroma incerta - accidental * Barau's petrel, Pterodroma baraui - accidental * Soft-plumaged petrel, Pterodroma mollis * Kerguelen petrel, Lugensa brevirostris * Blue petrel, Halobaena caerulea * Broad-billed prion, Pachyptila vittata * Salvin's prion, Pachyptila salvini * Antarctic prion, Pachyptila desolata * Fulmar prion, Pachyptila crassirostris * Slender-billed prion, Pachyptila belcheri - accidental * Fairy prion, Pachyptila turtur * Bulwer's petrel, Bulweria bulwerii - accidental * Jouanin's petrel, Bulweria fallax * White-chinned petrel, Procellaria aequinoctialis * Spectacled petrel, Procellaria conspicillata * Grey petrel, Procellaria cinerea * Cory's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea * Streaked shearwater, Calonectris leucomelas - accidental * Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis * Flesh-footed shearwater, Ardenna carneipes * Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus * Wedge-tailed shearwater, Ardenna pacificus * Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus * Balearic shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus * Tropical shearwater, Puffinus bailloni - accidental * Little shearwater, Puffinus assimilis Storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae The storm petrel, a relative of the petrel, is the smallest seabird.

There are 35 species worldwide, six in Southern Africa. * House sparrow, Passer domesticus - introduced * Great sparrow, Passer motitensis - near-endemic * Cape sparrow, Passer melanurus - near-endemic * Southern grey-headed sparrow, Passer diffusus * Northern grey-headed sparrow, Passer griseus * Yellow-throated petronia, Petronia superciliaris Weavers to widowbirds Order: PasseriformesFamily: Ploceidae Weavers, queleas, bishops and widowbirds are small, gregarious passerine birds related to finches. Most inhabit sub-Saharan Africa, though a few species occur in tropical Asia. Their rounded conical bills suit their granivorous diet. Males typically acquire striking summer plumages. Queleas, bishops and weavers are colonial nesters, and the latter group weaves conspicuous suspended nests. Widowbirds to the contrary are solitary, terrestrial nesters, but flock in winter. Of the 114 species worldwide, 27 exist in Southern Africa. * Red-billed buffalo weaver, Bubalornis niger * White-browed sparrow-weaver, Plocepasser mahali * Sociable weaver, Philetairus socius * Lesser masked weaver, Ploceus intermedius * Spectacled weaver, Ploceus ocularis * Cape weaver, Ploceus capensis - endemic * Yellow weaver, Ploceus subaureus * Holub's golden weaver, Ploceus xanthops * Southern brown- throated weaver, Ploceus xanthopterus * Southern masked weaver, Ploceus velatus * Village weaver, Ploceus cucullatus * Chestnut weaver, Ploceus rubiginosus * Dark-backed weaver, Ploceus bicolor * Olive-headed weaver, Ploceus olivaceiceps * Red-headed weaver, Anaplectes melanotis * Thick-billed weaver, Amblyospiza albifrons * Red-headed quelea, Quelea erythrops * Red- billed quelea, Quelea quelea * Yellow-crowned bishop, Euplectes afer * Black- winged red bishop, Euplectes hordeaceus * Southern red bishop, Euplectes orix * Yellow bishop, Euplectes capensis * Fan-tailed widowbird, Euplectes axillaris * Yellow-mantled widowbird, Euplectes macrourus * White-winged widowbird, Euplectes albonotatus * Red-collared widowbird, Euplectes ardens * Long-tailed widowbird, Euplectes progne Whydahs and indigobirds The indigobirds and whydahs, are small passerine birds native to Africa. These are finch-like species which usually have black or indigo predominating in their plumage. The whydahs have long or very long tails. All of the species are brood parasites, which lay their eggs in the nests of estrildid finches; most indigobirds use fire-finches as hosts, whereas the paradise whydahs chose pytilias. There are 19 species worldwide, eight in Southern Africa. * Pin- tailed whydah, Vidua macroura * Broad-tailed paradise whydah, Vidua obtusa * Long-tailed paradise whydah, Vidua paradisaea * Shaft-tailed whydah, Vidua regia * Village indigobird, Vidua chalybeata * Dusky indigobird, Vidua funerea * Purple indigobird, Vidua purpurascens * Twinspot indigobird, Vidua codringtoni Estrildid finches Order: PasseriformesFamily: Estrildidae The estrildid finches are small passerine birds of the Old World tropics and Australasia. They are gregarious and often colonial seed eaters with short thick but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but have wide variation in plumage colours and patterns. * Green-winged pytilia, Pytilia melba * Orange-winged pytilia, Pytilia afra - accidental * Red-billed firefinch, Lagonosticta senegala * African firefinch, Lagonosticta rubricata * Jameson's firefinch, Lagonosticta rhodopareia * Blue-breasted cordon-bleu, Uraeginthus angolensis * Violet-eared waxbill, Uraeginthus granatina * Black- faced waxbill, Estrilda erythronotos * Grey waxbill, Estrilda perreini * Cinderella waxbill, Estrilda thomensis * Common waxbill, Estrilda astrild * Violet-eared waxbill, Granatina granatina * Blue waxbill, Uraeginthus angolensis * Yellow-bellied waxbill, Coccopygia quartinia * Swee waxbill, Coccopygia melanotis * Zebra waxbill, Sporaeginthus subflavus * Bronze mannikin, Spermestes cucullatus * Black-and-white mannikin, Spermestes bicolor * Magpie mannikin, Spermestes fringilloides * African quailfinch, Ortygospiza atricollis * Red-headed finch, Amadina erythrocephala * Cut-throat finch, Amadina fasciata * Locust finch, Paludipasser locustella * Red-throated twinspot, Hypargos niveoguttatus * Pink-throated twinspot, Hypargos margaritatus * Green-backed twinspot, Mandingoa nitidula * Red-faced crimsonwing, Cryptospiza reichenovii * Lesser seedcracker, Pyrenestes minor Fringilline finches and allies Order: PasseriformesFamily: Fringillidae Finches are seed-eating passerine birds, that are small to moderately large and have a strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well.

They are seed eaters with distinctively shaped bills. Those occurring in the Old World are mostly known as buntings. In North America, most of this species are called sparrows, though the latter are not all that closely related to Old World sparrows, which belong to the family Passeridae. Emberizid species typically show distinctive head patterns. Of 275 species worldwide, five occur in Southern Africa. * Lark-like bunting, Emberiza impetuani * Cinnamon-breasted bunting, Emberiza tahapisi * Cape bunting, Emberiza capensis * Golden-breasted bunting, Emberiza flaviventris * Cabanis's bunting, Emberiza cabanisi See also * Endemic birds of southern Africa * Lists of birds by region * List of Gauteng birds * List of African birds * List of birds NotesReferences * Illustrated guide to the Birds of Southern Africa by Ian Sinclair, Phil Hockey and Warwick Tarboton * Southern African Birds: A Photographic Guide by Ian Sinclair and Ian Davidson * Newman's Birds of Southern Africa: The Green Edition by Kenneth Newman * Roberts VII Species List: A 'new' southern African bird list - Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology ","title":"List of birds of Southern Africa"},{"id":"10347350","title":"Stephie D'Souza"},{"id":"10347359","text":"NGC 4151 is an intermediate spiral seyfert galaxy with weak inner ring structure located from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. The galaxy was first mentioned by William Herschel on March 17, 1787; it was one of the two Seyfert galaxies described in the paper which defined the term. It is one of the nearest galaxies to Earth to contain an actively growing supermassive black hole; it was speculated that the nucleus may host a binary black hole, with about 40 million and about 10 million solar masses respectively, orbiting with a 15.8-year period. This is, however, still a matter of active debate. Some astronomers nickname it the \\"Eye of Sauron\\" from its appearance. X-ray source NGC 4151. X-rays (blue), optical data (yellow), radio observation (red) HST (WFC3). Astronomers using data from the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton satellite have found a long-sought X-ray signal from NGC 4151. When the black hole's X-ray source flares, its accretion disk reflects the emission about half an hour later. X-ray emission from NGC 4151 was apparently first detected on December 24, 1970, with the X-ray observatory satellite Uhuru, although the observation spanned an error-box of 0.56 square degrees and there is some controversy as to whether UHURU might not have detected the BL Lac object 1E 1207.9 +3945, which is inside their error box - the later HEAO 1 detected an X-ray source of NGC 4151 at 1H 1210+393, coincident with the optical position of the nucleus and outside the error box of Uhuru. To explain the X-ray emission two different possibilities have been proposed: * radiation of material falling onto the central black hole (which was growing much more quickly about 25,000 years ago) was so bright that it stripped electrons away from the atoms in the gas in its path, and then electrons recombined with these ionized atoms * the energy released by material flowing into the black hole in an accretion disk created a vigorous outflow of gas from the surface of the disk, which directly heated gas in its path to X-ray emitting temperatures See also * X-ray astronomy ReferencesExternal links * Hubble site news center: Fireworks Near a Black Hole in the Core of Seyfert Galaxy NGC 4151 Category:Galaxies discovered in 1787 Category:Intermediate spiral galaxies Category:Seyfert galaxies Category:Canes Venatici 4151 07166 38739 Category:X-ray astronomy Category:Astronomical X-ray sources Category:Articles containing video clips 17870317 ","title":"NGC 4151"},{"id":"10347360","text":"Per-Inge T√§llberg (born June 14, 1967 in Bolln√§sBiography at Sports- reference.com) is a Swedish former ski jumper who competed from 1986 to 1993.

Jane Welsh Carlyle (14 January 1801 ‚Äì 21 April 1866) was a Scottish writer. She did not publish any work in her lifetime, but she was widely seen as an extraordinary letter writer. Virginia Woolf called her one of the \\"great letter writers,\\" and Elizabeth Hardwick described her work as a \\"private writing career.\\" Life Jane Baillie Welsh was born in Haddington, East Lothian, 14 January 1801. She was the daughter of Dr. John Welsh (1770-1819) and his wife, Grace Caplegill.Grave of Welsh family, St Mary's Church, Haddington She was the wife of essayist Thomas Carlyle. =Marriage to Thomas Carlyle= Jane's tutor Edward Irving had introduced her to Carlyle, with whom she came to have a mutual romantic (although not sexually intimate) attraction. The couple married in 1826 and for the first six years lived on a farm in Scotland; the marriage was often unhappy. Thomas was always busy writing and Jane remained dutiful in doing the housework. After the couple moved from Scotland to London in 1834, Jane took on the added job of keeping the neighborhood quiet so that her husband could write undisturbed. Phyllis Rose wrote \\"the quintessential expression of Jane's role within the marriage was her continuing battle to protect her husband from the crowing of cocks.\\" In an 1844 letter to her husband, Jane wrote about this arrangement. \\"I slept much better last night, in spite of cocks of every variety of power, a dog, and a considerable rumblement of carts. But the evil of these things is not doubled or tripled for me by the reflection that you were being kept awake by them.\\" Their voluminous correspondence has been published, and the letters show that the couple's affection for each other was marred by frequent quarrels. Samuel Butler once wrote: \\"It was very good of God to let Carlyle and Mrs Carlyle marry one another, and so make only two people miserable and not four\\". Carlyle's biographer James Anthony Froude posthumously published his opinion that the marriage remained unconsummated.Froude, J. A. (1903). My Relations With Carlyle. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. Craigenputtock House 1829 Historian Paul Johnson notes in Creators that she not only irked her husband but made prickly comments about others. One target was fellow female writer George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), whose decision to live openly with her married lover Henry Lewes had scandalised London society. Seeing the pair at the theatre one evening, Jane remarked of Eliot, \\"Poor soul! There never was a more absurd miscalculation than her constituting herself an improper woman. She looks Propriety personified. Oh, so slow!\\" Haight, Gordon S., George Eliot‚Äôs Originals and Contemporaries: Essays in Victorian Literary History and Biography Their long marriage was complicated by other relationships on both sides, though these appear to have been platonic. The Carlyle marriage itself was believed to have been platonic by some of their contemporaries. Jane was jealous of a friendship her husband had with the socialite and hostess Lady Harriet Mary Montagu (later Lady Ashburton). The friendship was non-sexual yet they still spent a lot of time together. Jane expressed her jealousy and anger in a letter dated in 1856. =Relationship with Geraldine Jewsbury= National Trust, Carlyle's House; Supplied by The Public Catalogue Foundation, Jane Welsh Carlyle, ca. 1856, by Mrs. Paulet The grave of Jane Welsh Carlyle, St Mary's Church, Haddington Jane had a long and close friendship (1841-1866) with fellow writer Geraldine Jewsbury. The two women first met when Thomas invited Geraldine to Cheyne Row, where Thomas and Jane lived. Geraldine had written to Thomas before the invitation admiring his work,Woolf, The Second Common Reader (Penguin [1932]) p. 143 and also expressing her religious doubt. Geraldine was going through a depressive time, but she also contacted Thomas in the hopes of entering the literary realm in England. When Geraldine and Jane met, their friendship turned out to be more of a romantic relationship. It is evident both women had feelings for each other, but there is no evidence of them being lovers. Jane always remained dutiful to her husband and neither had acted upon any romantic feelings. This caused a lot of jealousy between the two women as Jane always remained married to Thomas and Geraldine had lovers of her own. However, they both had passionate feelings towards one another and that passion is expressed in their many letters to one another: as Geraldine wrote, ‚ÄúI feel towards you much more like a lover than a female friend‚Äù.Quoted in Woolf, The Second Common Reader (Penguin [1932]) p. 144 They often had disagreements about common social issues of the era such as the place of men in women's lives and the purpose of women in general. Geraldine wasn't opposed to marriage, but she thought man and woman should be equal in marriage; she didn't witness that with Jane and Thomas, and criticised the great man for it.Woolf, ‚ÄòThe Second Common Reader (Penguin [1932]) p. 145 Jane often tried to set up Geraldine with suitable bachelors in London. However, none of them stuck (Geraldine never married). Plaque to Jane Welsh Carlyle, St Mary's, Haddington When they were on good terms, Jane helped Geraldine with many of her literary works, including two of Geraldine's most popular novels, Zoe: the History of Two Lives,Woolf, The Second Common Reader (Penguin [1932]) p. 147-8 and The Half Sisters, which Geraldine wanted to dedicate to her.Woolf, The Second Common Reader (Penguin [1932]) p. 150 In 1857, Geraldine became romantically involved with Walter Mantell. The two women became distant. But near the end of her life, when Jane was very ill, the two reconnected. When Jane died, Geraldine spoke of Jane as ‚Äúthe friend of my heart‚Äù.Quoted in A Booth, Homes and Haunts (2016) p. 232 These two women had a very interesting relationship from a romantic, literary, and friendly perspective. Virginia Woolf based a 1929 article in the Times Literary Supplement on Geraldine's letters to Jane Carlyle,A Booth, Homes and Haunts (2016) p. 244 later published in ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Second Common Reader‚Äô‚Äô.Woolf, The Second Common Reader (Penguin [1932]) p. 143 Their passionate relationship was recognized among their literary peers despite the ups and downs of their friendship. Letters Plaque to Jane Welsh Carlyle, 23 George Square, Edinburgh Throughout her life, Jane Carlyle valued letters. \\"A newspaper is very pleasant when one is expecting nothing at all; but when it comes in place of a letter it is a positive insult to one's feelings.\\" Francis Wilson writes that \\"Jane‚Äôs letters, which have lost nothing of their freshness and mischief, take us immediately into her world, or rather into the world as she chose to construct it. She saw her letters as a roman fleuve ...in which she recorded conversations, sketched what she called ‚Äòdramas in one scene' and reshaped her days for comic effect.\\" After Jane's sudden death from a stroke or heart attack in 1866 Thomas Carlyle published a highly self-critical \\"Reminiscences,\\" based on her diary. He expresses remorse for the neglect and mistreatment evident in the diary. Phyllis Rose writes that \\"few women in history - or even literature - were more successful at making their husbands feel guilty than Jane Carlyle. The Scottish philosopher David George Ritchie, a friend of the Carlyle family, published a volume of her letters in 1889 under the title The Early Letters of Jane Welsh Carlyle. Since then a number of the Carlyle letters have been collected and published, including the multi- volume collection of the correspondence of both Jane and Thomas. In 1973, American scholar G. B. Tennyson described her as \\"one of the rare Victorian wives who are of literary interest in their own right...to be remembered as one of the great letter writers (in some respects her husband‚Äôs superior) of the nineteenth century is glory beyond the dreams of avarice.\\" Memorials She died in London on 21 April 1866 and is buried with her father in St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington. The grave (railed off) stands inside the church close to the west end. A plaque to Jane stands on the west side of George Square in Edinburgh. ReferencesFurther reading * Ashton, Rosemary (2001).

Martin's The Baby- Sitters Club. All fifteen novels are written as first-person journals. The premise of the Diaries is that they are a school project; all students at their school must keep a journal, with the contents and method left up to them. The main conflict of the series arises when the eighth grade is merged with the high school. The students abruptly go from being the oldest in middle school to the youngest in high school (now grades 8-12). This series covers more mature themes than The Baby-Sitters Club, such as alcohol, eating disorders, and cancer. Books #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #9, #10, and #14 were ghostwritten by Peter Lerangis, #7, #8, #13 were ghostwritten by Jeanne Betancourt, and #15 was ghostwritten by Nola Thacker. The interior illustrations in Amalia's diaries are by Stieg Retlin. The first six books of the series have been translated into German.https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?query=Ann+M.+Martin+Wunderlich&method;=simpleSearch Main characters Dawn Schafer, a member of The Baby-Sitters Club from Connecticut, returns to California to live with her father, stepmother, and brother. Upon her arrival, she reunites with old friends, and they try to revive the West Coast version of the Baby-Sitters Club; the We Love Kids Club. She spends the majority of the series trying to keep the group together, and to balance her desire to live in two states at once. At several points in the series, she has major conflicts with Sunny, usually regarding how infrequently Sunny visits her mother in the hospital. She gains a little sister named Elizabeth Grace (\\"Gracie\\") later in the series. Sunny Winslow is Dawn's best friend in California. Her mother is suffering (and eventually dies) from lung cancer, and her father works all the time in his bookstore to avoid his pain, so he doesn't pay much attention to her. Sunny's rebellious behavior and negative attitude towards her friends are the main sources of conflict throughout the series, though Sunny's diaries reveal that she's acting out to get the attention she desires from her parents. She runs away from home in her first diary. In her third diary, her mother dies, leading Sunny to finally reconcile with her friends. Maggie Blume is a girl whose father is obsessed with his job as a studio executive, but also puts pressure on her to have a detailed plan for high school and succeed academically. Maggie's true passion, however, is songwriting, which she hides fearing her father's disapproval; once her friends learn of her talent, however, she ends up becoming the lead singer for a band called Vanish. Maggie's early diaries also focus on her crush on another student, Justin Randall, whom she sees as unattainable. Her desire to regain control of her life causes her to develop anorexia. Throughout the series, her biggest struggle comes from trying to assert herself. Her mother's alcoholism eventually helps Maggie realize that she has a problem as well. Amalia Vargas is Maggie's best friend. In her first diary, she is dating James, a junior at Vista. He becomes abusive and she breaks up with him with the support of her friends and sister. After this, she fears James, who has been stalking her since the breakup. He finally leaves her alone when she finds a new boyfriend, Brendan. Amalia is the manager of a band called Vanish. She was originally brought into the group by James, but the others realize that Amalia may have to quit if James remains. The other band members are Maggie, Patti, Bruce, Justin, and Rico. Amalia is fond of drawing in her diary. She lives with her parents and sister, Isabel. Ducky McCrae is a 16-year-old high school sophomore whose real name is Christopher. He is friends with Dawn, Sunny, Maggie, and Amalia. His old friends, Jason (nicknamed \\"Jay\\") and Alex have previously drifted away. Jason is interested in girls, and Alex has depression and suicidal tendencies. His parents travel for months at a time, so he lives with his irresponsible older brother, Ted, whom his parents prefer.

This allows it to stream content to multiple viewing locations.http://www.engadgethd.com/2006/10/30/engadget-hd-review-hdhomerun/ General details There are currently a number of HDHomeRun models on the market: *single-tuner ATSC/clear QAM *dual-tuner ATSC/clear QAM *dual-tuner commercial (TECH) ATSC/clear QAM *dual-tuner DVB-T/unencrypted DVB-C *three tuner CableCard/clear QAM All models are designed to receive unencrypted digital broadcast or cable television and stream it over a network for use by any PC on the network. HDHomeRun normally receives an IP address via DHCP but will also work via an auto IP address if no DHCP server is available. The HDHomeRun Windows driver presents the tuners as standard BDA tuners, enabling BDA-compliant applications to work with the HDHomeRun. The HDHomeRun can also be controlled via a command-line application which is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, and other POSIX-compliant operating systems. The control library is open source and is available under the LGPL for use in custom applications. Select retail packaged HDHomeRun units are distributed with Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre.

Microsoft provides Windows Media Center for Windows XP through 8, but discontinued the product in Windows 10. Apple macOS 10 runs EyeTV 3. Linux runs Myth TV.https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Silicondust_HDHomeRunhttp://www.linux.com/articles/61518 Newer models of HDHomeRun are DLNA device compatible. HDHomeRun Prime Introduced Fall 2011, the HDHomeRun Prime adds CableCARD support to allow viewers to view and record all the digital cable channels they subscribe to without using a cable supplied set-top-box. This includes premium cable channels like HBO, Showtime, and Starz. It integrates easily with Windows Media Center (WMC), included with Windows 7 and available with Windows 8, and turns your PC into an HD DVR. With 3 tuners, the Prime lets you record two programs and watch another live all at the same time. Once set up on your local network, other DLNA home video devices like most current HDTV's and Blu- ray players, Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles, and WMC Extenders Version 2 all have access to live TV and recorded cable TV. * CableCards are available from every US digital cable provider and are always less expensive than renting a set- top-box; usually less than $3 per month. * The Prime can also be used without a CableCard in cable systems that still have clear QAM channels available. * The Prime does not support digital cable on demand, but can receive PPV that is ordered on the phone from your cable provider. * The Prime is a dedicated cable TV device with no ATSC tuner and thus can not be used with an antenna. * Windows Media Center is the most widely used software available for use with the Prime, and the only one with Digital Rights Management (DRM) to view and record premium cable channels like HBO. Many other software options are available; please see the list in this Wiki and the Silicondust website for details. When running WMC, an additional, separate ATSC tuner can be used with the PC and WMC will combine both the Prime and ATSC tuner in the guide for live TV and recording. By default WMC has a 4 tuner limit for each type (ATSC, CableCard) of tuner, but a 3rd party software product called TunerSalad increases the number of tuners to 32 per type; you can use up to 32 cable tuners (11 Primes = 33 cable tuners) and 32 ATSC tuners, for a total of 64 tuners. There is also another 3rd party software called My Channel Logos that adds channel logos to the WMC channel guide. For detailed discussion of WMC, please see TheGreenButton.tv website. Please note that WMC was included with Windows 7 but is an additional $100 for Windows 8/8.1 and an additional $10 for Windows 8/8.1 Pro. It is not available from Microsoft on Windows 10 but members at The Green Button are developing a way to use a modified version of WMC with Windows 10. HDHomeRun DVR The HDHomeRun DVR is a DVR software designed for installation on a network-attached storage device. It is intended to be used with a HDHomeRun tuner and is expected to overcome digital rights management complications. HDHomeRun Premium TV Launched in 2018, HDHomeRun Premium TV was a virtual MVPD service that worked with the HDHomeRun Prime and HDHomeRun DVR service. A unique feature of this service over most other MVPDs was the ability to record the channel streams to a local hard drive for time- shifted viewing. In March 2019, HDHomeRun announced that it would shut down its Premium service.https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/hdhomerun-premium-tv-is- shutting-down See also * Monsoon HAVA * Dreambox * DBox2 * Slingbox * LocationFree Player ReferencesExternal links * Category:Television technology Category:Television placeshifting technology ","title":"HDHomeRun"},{"id":"10347786","text":"Christoph Lehmann (born 28 December 1968) is a Swiss former ski jumper who competed from 1988 to 1993.

Interpretation Canna is a genus of 10 species of flowering plants. In the poem's legerdemain the cryptic middle stanza conceals the sleight of hand. Poor X wakes in his sleep (\\"Now day-break comes\\") and consequently his eye clings to the canna forever.Canna, according to the 1913 Webster: A genus of tropical plants, with large leaves and often with showy flowers. The Indian shot (Canna Indica) is found in gardens of the northern United States. The cleverness of the poem links it to \\"The Worms at Heaven's Gate\\". The poetic conceit here may be contrasted with Descartes' philosophical proposition that a person must always be thinking when asleep, on pain of ceasing to exist. Day-dreaming, sleep-walking, catatonic X is fixated upon the showy canna that fill the terrace of his capitol, his consciousness. Buttel forgoes this interpretation in favor of the idea that the poem celebrates the poetic counterpart of a painter's \\"primitive eye\\". Such poets would achieve what Monet and the Impressionists desired, recovering from blindness and seeing the world \\"with utmost clarity, without preconceptions\\".Buttel, p. 155 \\"They would be like X in Stevens' 'Anecdote of Canna'\\", Buttel writes, \\"who at daybreak 'Observes the Canna with a clinging eye,' as though for the first time\\". Neither interpretation, however, identifies who X is, the starting point of a reading of the poem which does more than merely scratch the surface. In the poem, \\"X\\" is identified merely as a 'mighty man' with a 'mighty thought'.  Notes  References  * Buttel, Robert. Wallace Stevens: The Making of Harmonium. 1967: Princeton University Press.

It is a freshwater aquatic fern, with scale-like fronds 5‚Äì10 mm long, green to reddish, most often reddish in strong light and in winter. They are covered in tiny protuberances called trichomes that give it the appearance of velvet.Flora of North America: Azolla cristata Aquatic Plant Information System: Azolla It is able to fix nitrogen from the air by means of symbiotic cyanobacteria. It can survive winter water temperatures of 5 ¬∞C(41 degrees Fahrenheit), with optimum summer growth between 25‚Äì30 ¬∞C. (77-86 degrees Fahrenheit) NESAC: Package of Practice for Azolla {Frond detail  Azolla cristata at Jack London State Historic Park } Identification The only sure method of distinguishing this species from Azolla filiculoides is to examine the trichomes on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Trichomes are small protuberances that create water resistance. They are unicellular in A. filiculoides but septate (two-celled) in A. cristata. Name This species has long been known under the name Azolla caroliniana. However, research by Evrard & Van Hove found that the type specimen of A. caroliniana actually consists of plants of Azolla filiculoides and so the name caroliniana has always been improperly applied to this species. Cultivation and uses Azolla cristata is of commercial importance in cultivation in southern and eastern Asia as a bio-fertilizer, valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits crops such as rice when the fern is grown under it and reduces the need for artificial fertilizer addition. The thick mat of fronds (up to 4 cm thick) also suppresses weed growth. Harvested fronds are also used as a food for fish and poultry. It is also often used as a floating plant in both coldwater and tropical aquaria, as well as in outdoor ponds; it is propagated by division.Hiscock, P. (2003). Encyclopedia of Aquarium Plants.

The concept of knowledge management is based on a range of practices used by an individual, a business, or a large corporation to identify, create, represent and redistribute information for a range of purposes. Software that enables an information practice or range of practices at any part of the processes of information management can be deemed to be called information management software. A subset of information management software that emphasizes an approach to build knowledge out of information that is managed or contained is often called knowledge management software. KM software in most cases provides a means for individuals, small groups or mid-sized businesses to innovate, build new knowledge in the group, and/or improve customer experience. Knowledge management systems (software) include a range of about 1,500 or more different approaches to collect and contain information to then build knowledge that can be searched through specialised search tools. These include concept building tools and/or visual search tools that present information in a connected manager not originally conceptualised by those collecting or maintaining the information database. One of the main categories of Knowledge Management software is Groupware, which can be used for knowledge sharing and capture. Groupware is a combination of synchronous, asynchronous and community focused tools. Groupware can be used to exchange knowledge and expertise even when the team members are situated around the world.de Carvalho, Rodrigo Baroni, and Marta Ara√∫jo Tavares Ferreira. \\"Knowledge Management Software.\\" Encyclopedia of Knowledge Management, edited by David G. Schwartz, Idea Group Reference, 2006, pp. 410-418. Gale Virtual Reference Library, http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX3467300066/GVRL Features Features of KM software usually include: * Aggregation of content from both internal and external sources * Classification of content using taxonomies * Search * Expertise location * Views/dashboards As business today is becoming increasingly international, the ability to access information in different languages is now a requirement for some organizations. Reported success factors of a KM system include the capability to integrate well with existing internal systems and the scalability of the system to grow within the organization. Range KM software ranges from small software packages for an individual to use, such as brainstorming software, to highly specialized enterprise software suitable for use by hundreds of employees. Often KM software provides a key resource for employees working in customer service or telephone support industries, or sectors of large corporations. Knowledge management software, in general, enables the combination of unstructured information sources, such as individual word processed documents and/or .pdf formats, email, graphic illustrations, unstructured notes, website links, invoices, and other information bearing collections, such as a simple thought, through to a combination of millions of interactions from a website, and through that combination enables the seeker to obtain knowledge that otherwise would not have been discovered. As Internet access speeds increased, many on- demand (or software as a service) products have evolved and are now the leading suppliers of KM software. Visual search One of the departures from the almost standard keyword search approach are those group of companies developing visual search techniques. Some common visual search approaches include: * Tree traversal - Where a folder is opened and inside the display of that folder are further sub-folders. The folders are searched in a specific order, exactly once, in a systematic manner. This tree traversal approach relies on the naming of folders to provide a rich enough indication as to what is contained in the next folder or level of folders. * Taxonomy navigation - A taxonomy (or topic map) is the classification of things or concepts, as well as the principles underlying such classification. In KM software, taxonomies are often used as a way of visually structuring the available information by tagging it with relevant topics and visually represent them as folders and sub-folders inside the taxonomy. Users can then navigate the taxonomy and select the topic, or combination of topics (faceted search), to perform the search on. * Tag Cloud search - Once text data has been tagged with certain topics it can be visually represented as a Tag Cloud, where the importance of each tag is represented as a font size and/or color. This way you can identify and pick the most prominent topics. * Matrix/Heat Map search - The classification of information into topics facilitates visualization and analysis of the information flow. A combined topic search can be presented as values in a Matrix, and a Heat Map is a graphical representation of that data, presented in colors.

At Dundee United he played in two Scottish League Cup final winning teams. He was the first winner of the Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year award. Playing career=Club= Graeme Payne was born in Dundee on 13 February 1956. While playing for St Columba's Boys Club, he joined Dundee United on schoolboy forms in May 1971. When Jim McLean became Dundee United manager later that year, he placed great emphasis on the club developing its own youth players, and Payne would be one of the first to break through. As a provisional signing, he was called up to play for the reserve team in 1972. After turning professional, he made his first team debut aged 17 on the opening day of the 1973‚Äì74 season, playing against East Fife in a Scottish League Cup match. He continued to feature regularly over the following season, culminating with an appearance in the 1974 Scottish Cup Final defeat against Celtic. Previously, Payne's goal against Heart of Midlothian in the semi-final replay had helped United through to what was their first appearance in the final of the competition. After his appearances during the 1975‚Äì76 season were limited by injuries, Payne re-established himself as a first team player in the latter part of the 1970s and won the first ever SPFA Young Player of the Year award in 1978. He was part of the Dundee United team that won the club's first two major trophies, playing in the 1979 Scottish League Cup Final win against Aberdeen, and the 1980 Final, when United retained the trophy against Dundee. By the 1980s, however, Payne was featuring less often in the first team. When Dundee United were Premier Division champions in 1982-83, he made only three league appearances and spent the second half of the season on loan to Morton. Payne left Dundee United in May 1984, joining Arbroath for a nominal transfer fee, and also had spells with Brechin City and St Johnstone before retiring from football to working the insurance industry. =International= Payne represented Scotland at youth and under-21 international level. He was named in the preliminary pool of forty players for the 1978 World Cup, but didn't make the final squad and never appeared at full international level.

It is used by the FBI to represent the organization and to authenticate certain documents that it issues. The term is used both for the physical seal itself, and more generally for the design impressed upon it. The current version of the seal has been in use since 1941. Designed in 1940 by FBI Special Agent Leo Gauthier, it derives its design from the FBI's flag and symbolizes the values, standards and history of the Bureau through the various elements incorporated in the design. It should not be confused with the FBI badge, which is older and has a different design. The seal's usage is regulated by U.S. federal law, under which it is a criminal offense to make unauthorized commercial or otherwise inappropriate use of the seal and name of the FBI. The FBI actively polices the use of its seal and has taken action against commercial vendors using it without authorization. The FBI has, however, also given approval to third party publishers to convey messages endorsed by the Bureau, such as campaigns against drug abuse and copyright infringement.  Design  The colors and symbol of the seal of the FBI represent the values and standards of the FBI and the United States and allude to the history of both the organization and the country. The center of the seal depicts a shield bracketed by two laurel branches, with an inscribed scroll below, set against a blue field. A gold-outlined strip occupies the circumference of the field, bearing the words \\"DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\\" above, and \\"FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\\" below. A circle of thirteen golden stars surrounds the shield and laurels, representing unity of purpose and the original thirteen founding states of the United States. The laurel branches represent academic honors, distinction and fame. The two branches depict a total of 46 leaves, standing for the number of U.S. states when the FBI was founded in 1908. The blue field behind the central shield represents justice, as do the stripes set on a golden field at the shield's top. Five parallel vertical red and white stripes make up the rest of the shield, echoing the colors of the Flag of the United States. As with the flag, there is one more red stripe than white. The stripes symbolize the values of the FBI; the red stripes stand for courage, valor, and strength, while the white ones represent light, cleanliness, and truth. Below the wreath and shield is a scroll bearing the words \\"Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity\\". This slogan, which was devised in 1935 by FBI Inspector W.H. Drane Lester,The FBI: A Centennial History, 1908-2008, p. 121 describes the high moral standards and high level of motivation the FBI expects from its staff. It also reflects the Bureau's own initials as a \\"backronym\\" of sorts. However, a Newsweek article from 2008 credits Edward Allen Tamm, once a top aide to J. Edgar Hoover who regularly briefed President Franklin Roosevelt on domestic intelligence matters with the invention of the motto: \\"He's credited in some bureau histories with inventing (in 1935) not only the bureau's name, but its official motto: Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity.\\" The outer edge of the seal consists of a series of beveled golden peaks. This represents the severe challenges that the FBI faces every day and alludes to the ruggedness of the organization. The gold color represents the richness and history of the Bureau's mission. The FBI badge, which is distinct from the FBI seal and does not use the same design The FBI seal should not be confused with the FBI badge, which dates from 1935 and has a very different design that does not incorporate the seal. The badge consists of a miniature shield crested by an eagle. The face of the shield depicts Justitia holding her scales and a sword, alongside the names of the FBI and the Department of Justice. A modified version of the FBI seal is used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Police, the uniformed division of the FBI tasked with the protection of the Bureau's facilities, properties and personnel. The FBI Police symbol is a golden shield with the seal set at the center flanked by twin laurel branches. At top and bottom are scrolls bearing the words \\"FBI\\" and \\"POLICE\\" respectively. History The badge of an FBI special agent. When the FBI was founded in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation (later the Division of Investigation) it was a subordinate organization of the United States Department of Justice. It had no logo of its own but used the existing seal of the Department of Justice. In 1935 it became an independent service within the Department of Justice and changed its name to the present-day Federal Bureau of Investigation. To reflect its new identity it adopted a version of the Department of Justice seal with the words \\"Federal Bureau of Investigation\\" and \\"Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity\\" added to the outer band. Various proposals were floated over the next few years for a new FBI seal that would retain the connection with the Department of Justice while expressing the FBI's own values and distinct identity. The current version of the seal dates from 1940 and was designed by Special Agent Leo Gauthier, who was a draftsman, artist and illustrator. He had previously designed a flag for the Bureau and used elements of that design to create a new seal. It was accepted immediately.  Usage  Since 1954, Federal law has protected the FBI seal against unauthorized commercial use. The unauthorized use of the seal is subject to prosecution under federal criminal law, including Sections 701 and 709 of Title 18 of the United States Code. The latter Section prohibits the use of the words \\"Federal Bureau of Investigation\\" or the initialism \\"F.B.I.\\", > in connection with any advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet or other > publication, play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, > in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such > advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet or other publication, play, motion > picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, is approved, endorsed, or > authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI has taken action against commercial vendors making unauthorized use of the seal and other Federal agency seals and symbols, such as Smokey Bear. For instance, a New York toy manufacturer used the FBI seal on a toy water pistol. The manufacturer was warned by the Bureau to remove the seal or face prosecution. = Commercial works = The seal has, however, been used with permission in many commercial works of popular culture. An authorized history of the Bureau, The F.B.I. Story, was published in 1956 with the seal displayed on the book's dust jacket with the permission of FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover also permitted the long-running ABC series The F.B.I., on which he was a consultant, to open and close every episode with the image of the seal. Cast, painted or engraved versions of the seal are displayed on a number of properties associated with the FBI. J. Edgar Hoover's grave at Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. is surrounded by a wrought-iron fence bearing a cast metal replica of the FBI seal. The \\"J. Edgar Hoover Bench\\" stands nearby bearing a modified version of the seal that represents the Society of Former Special Agents. A large engraved version of the FBI seal is displayed at the entrance of the J. Edgar Hoover Building, the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. = Anti-piracy campaign = The FBI seal has become a familiar sight for users of digital entertainment media in the United States due to its appearance on DVDs, CDs and video games. It appeared in arcade games during a late 1980s anti-drugs campaign, alongside the words \\"Winners Don't Use Drugs\\". In February 2004, the FBI announced a joint anti-piracy program with the Motion Picture Association of America, Recording Industry Association of America, Entertainment Software Association and the Software and Information Industry Association under which an \\"FBI Anti-Piracy Warning\\" would be displayed prominently on disks, sleeves and in DVD title cards. The warning notice displays the FBI seal defaced with a strip bearing the words \\"FBI ANTI- PIRACY WARNING\\", accompanied by a text warning of the illegality of unauthorized copying. The anti-piracy campaign was initiated following the passage by Congress of the Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2003, which ordered the FBI to develop a program against copyright infringement. The seal is used under a Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the FBI and the Recording Industry Association of America. Since August 13, 2012, the FBI has permitted all copyright holders to use the seal, subject to restrictions. In particular, the seal must be used adjacent to the text \\"The unauthorized reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work is illegal. Criminal copyright infringement, including infringement without monetary gain, is investigated by the FBI and is punishable by fines and federal imprisonment.\\" or \\"Warning: Unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws.\\" = Wikimedia Commons = In July 2010, the FBI ordered the Wikimedia Foundation to remove the seal from Wiki servers, stating that its unauthorized presence on the encyclopedia was illegal under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß701. Wikimedia's general counsel, Mike Godwin, declined to comply, stating that the FBI was misconstruing the law, which he said was intended to prevent people from using fake FBI badges or profiting from the use of the seal. = Logo =See also *Copyright status of work by the U.S. government *Great Seal of the United States *Seal of the President of the United States *Seal of the United States Senate *Winners Don't Use Drugs ReferencesExternal links * 18 U.S.C. ¬ß701, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß709, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß712 ‚Äì Related federal criminal law. * 41 U.S.C. ¬ß128-1.5007 ‚Äì Authorization for reproduction of departmental and bureau seals.

Among the Jews he was known as Hakham Haim, because of his Talmudic learning.Mikhayil Mishaqa, Murder, Mayhem, Pillage, and Plunder: The History of the Lebanon in the 18th and 19th Centuries, tr. W.M.Thackston, Jr. SUNY, Albany New York, 1988 p.49 Farhi was chief advisor to Ahmad al- Jazzar of Acre, whose whims included blinding Farhi and leaving him physically scarred. Until his assassination in 1820, instigated by Farhi's own protege Abdullah Pasha, Farhi was the financial vizier and de facto ruler of Acre. After the murder, Abdullah Pasha ordered Farhi's body cast into the sea and confiscated all his property.http://www.farhi.org/history.htm Two of Farhi‚Äôs brothers, Soliman and Rafael, living in Damascus, organized a siege against Abdullah Pasha in Acre to exact revenge. Historical background After the Ottoman conquest of the Levant from the Mamluks in 1516, Galilee became part of its empire. Vast areas of Turkey, Asia, North Africa and Southeastern Europe were ruled almost autonomously by local governors. The Levant in particular, split into numerous feuding power centers.Efraim Karsh Islamic Imperialism: A History, Yale University Press, New Haven and London 2007 p.95 Rule over the 'Sanjak of Acre' (roughly present-day northern Israel) was supposed to derive from the authority of the Damascus governorate and its Walis. In the 18th century, a powerful local leader, Zahir al-Umar, effectively severed ties with the empire and initiated widespread reforms, improving road infrastructure and security, and encouraging Christian and Jewish merchants to settle in the area and revive commerce. After the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji was signed with Russia on July 21, 1774, Sultan Abdul Hamid I sought to reassert Turkish sovereignty by attacking Dhaher and blockading the port of Acre. His troops rose in revolt and murdered their leader. In 1775 a Turkish officer, the Bosnian Mameluk Ahmad al-Jazzar took over, and the Turks regained control over the northern areas of the land.Isaiah Friedman, Germany, Turkey , Zionism 1897-1918, Transaction Publishers,New Brunswick, New Jersey (1977) 1998 p.26 Zahir al-Umar actively encouraged Jewish resettlement and personally invited Hayyim ben Jacob Abulafia of ƒ∞zmir to settle in the Galilee. The rabbi, born in Hebron, then part of the Jerusalem Mutassariflik (Governorate/District), returned in 1740 and was received with full honours by Zahir. He settled in Tiberias, which was restored from its ruinous state. An impressive synagogue was built, roads were constructed, and Jewish agricultural settlements were founded at Pekiin, Shefa-'Amr, and Kafr Yasif. These policies continued under Ahmad al-Jazzar. The existence of a strong local authority enforced the law and prevented Bedouin banditry on the roads. Zahir was one of the most tolerant and efficient local leaders and meted out justice equally to Muslim, Christian and Jew. This was the case in the days of Zahir and al-Jazzar who transformed the Galilee into a region that attracted both Arabs from Syria and Lebanon, and Jews from the east and west. Adviser to al-Jazzar \\"Jezzar Pacha Condemning a Criminal\\", Farhi is pictured standing with paper in hand. Haim Farhi was born to a respected and ancient Jewish family in Damascus. His father Saul had established a banking business that flourished to the extent that it expanded to control Syria's finances, banking and foreign trade for nearly a century.Lucien Gubbay, Sunlight and Shadow:The Jewish Experience of Islam, Other Press, New York (1999) 2000 p.130Thomas Philipp, The Farhi Family and the Changing Position of the Jews in Syria, 1759-1860, in Middle Eastern Studies No. 20, October, 1984, pp.37-52 passim Together with other family members, Farhi worked as a financial agent in the Damascus district.Itzhak Ben-Zvi, Eretz-Israel under Ottoman Rule, 2nd ed. Jerusalem (Heb)1966 pp.319-22,339-43, cited Norman A. Stillman, The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book, The Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia 1979 p.338 n.7. [The main job of a financial agent or sarraf was to lend money or to play the role of guarantor in financial and commercial operations within the Ottoman economy. They acted as ordinary merchant bankers in any kind of economy. The position was dominated by non- Muslims, mainly Armenians, Jews, and Catholics. (Yavuz Cesar, The role of the Sarrafi in Ottoman Finance and Economy in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, Colin Imber and Keiko Kiyotaki (eds.) Frontiers of Ottoman Studies: State, Province, and the West, vol. 1, 2005. I.B. Tauris, London and New York pp.61-76, p.66.)] Contemporary sources often mention the family as being the \\"real rulers of Syria\\".Isaiah Friedman, Germany, Turkey , Zionism 1897-1918, Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, New Jersey (1977) 1998 p.26. They may also have mediated between the Jewish community and the authorities, trying to alleviate the tax burden placed on the Jews of Safed. Farhi succeeded his father as banker of the ruler of Damascus. He gained extensive influence with the Turkish government and became the adviser to Ahmad al-Jazzar, ruler of Acre. This was probably due to his intrigues that led to the execution of the previous advisor, Mikhail Sakruj, a Christian merchant from Shefa-'Amr.Thomas Philipp, Acre: The Rise and Fall of a Palestinian City, 1730-1831, Columbia University Press, New York 2002 p. 161 Al-Jazzar was a violent and cruel ruler, which is evidenced from his title 'al-Jazzar' meaning 'The Butcher'. He would often find pretext to lash out in savage assaults. He had Farhi's eye plucked out, cut off the tip of his nose, and severed his left ear.Mikhayil Mishaqa, Murder, Mayhem, Pillage, and Plunder: The History of the Lebanon in the 18th and 19th Centuries, tr. W.M.Thackston, Jr. Suny, Albany New York, 1988 p.49 (A famous illustration from the time shows al-Jazzar sitting in judgment in front of his Jewish adviser, who is wearing an eye patch.) Defeating Napoleon's siege 19th-century cannon, set in the wall of Acre near a sign commemorating Farhi. The Hebrew inscription on the sign reads: Farhi vs. Napoleon. Jezzar's right hand in resisting Napoleon's harsh siege was the Jewish Haim Farhi, senior adviser and minister of financeThe remains of the internal fortification line erected by Farhi and De-Phelipoux within the walls of Acre, during Napoleon's siege, May 1799. It was during the reign of al-Jazzar, in 1799, that the French general and future Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte tried to conquer the Damascus governorate. In February Napoleon and his army arrived from the south, captured Jaffa and massacred 2,000 Turkish prisoners. They then moved north, captured Haifa and the Jezreel Valley and laid siege to Acre. Al-Jazzar's troops, refusing to surrender, withstood the siege for one and a half months. A British naval force under the command of Admiral Sidney Smith came to the town's defense, and an artillery expert from the fleet, Antoine DePhelipoux, redeployed against Napoleon's forces artillery pieces which the British had intercepted from the French at sea. Farhi played a key role in the city's defense. As al-Jazzar's adviser and right-hand man, he directly supervised how the battle against the siege was run. At the culmination of the assault, the besieging forces managed to make a breach in the walls. After suffering many casualties to open an entry-point, Napoleon's soldiers found, on trying to penetrate the city, that Farhi and DePhelipoux had, in the meantime, built a second wall, several feet deeper within the city where al-Jazzar's garden was. Discovery of this new construction convinced Napoleon and his men that the probability of their taking the city was minimal. The siege was raised and Napoleon withdrew to Egypt. Some hold that a statement attributed to Napoleon during the war, according to which he promised to return the land to the Jews if he were to succeed in his conquest of Palestine (Southern Syria), was meant to capture Farhi‚Äôs attention and betray his master by switching his support to the French. However, Napoleon never showed any particular interest in winning over the Jews of Ottoman Syria during his campaign there,Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine: L'invention de la terre sainte, 1799-1922, Fayard, Paris 1999 p.18 though his account of the military campaign records that a rumour among Syrian Jews had it that after Napoleon took Acre, he would go to Jerusalem and restore Solomon's temple.Franz Kobler, Napoleon and the Jews, Masada Press, Jerusalem,1975 p.51  Murder  After the death of al-Jazzar in 1804, his mamluk Sulayman Pasha succeeded to the Pashalik of Akko. Under him, the Jews enjoyed, according to one traveller, 'perfect religious freedom', and were relieved of the substantial fines they were frequently compelled to pay under al-Jazzar, and were obliged to pay only the customary kharadj.John Lewis Burckhardt, Travels in Syria and the Holy Land, London 1822 pp.327-8, reprinted in Norman A. Stillman, The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book, The Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia 1979 pp.338-9. Sulayman continued working with Farhi and employed him much as his own father had. Sulayman held sway over the region until his death in 1819, when he bequeathed his power to Farhi's adopted son, Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali, the orphan of a bey who had died prematurely. However, Abdullah determined to rid himself of his foster-father, Farhi. When Farhi got word of the decision, he refused to flee, believing such an action would imperil his fellow Jews in the kingdom. On 21 August 1820, soldiers appeared at Farhi's residence in Acre, denouncing him as a traitor. They seized and strangled him to death, and ransacked his house. His family was denied permission to bury his body. The family assets were expropriated and Farhi's body was cast into the sea. The family escaped to Damascus; Farhi's wife, unable to withstand the rigours of the journey, died on the way, in Safed. Abdullah then compelled the Jews of Acre and Safed to pay in full all the back taxes they would have owed had they not been exempted, through Farhi's good offices, from paying over the years. Farhi's murder precipitated what one recent historian of the city called \\"the first, serious ... existential crisis\\" for Acre.Thomas Philipp, Acre: The Rise and Fall of a Palestinian City, 1730-1831, Columbia University Press, New York 2002 p. 90 Retaliation When word of Farhi's murder reached Damascus, his brothers, Salomon, Raphael, and Moise, swore to avenge him. They hired Turkish officers in Damascus and Aleppo to that purpose, wrote to Chalabi Carmona, an influential Jew of Constantinople, to ask the Sultan for justice, and requested a firman to that effect. Carmona obtained from Grand Mufti of Constantinople Sheikh ul-Islam, the supreme religious authority of the Ottoman Empire, a firman requiring the governors of Damascus, Aleppo and two other pashas to lend their troops to the three brothers in their pursuance of justice against Abdullah. In April 1821 the Farhi brothers arrived with a large army in the Akko Sanjak. They first conquered the Galilee, defeating the armies Abdullah sent to meet them, and appointing new rulers to take away his authority in every region they conquered. When they finally reached Acre, they besieged it for 14 months. During the siege, the eldest brother, Salomon, was poisoned (according to some sources, stabbed) by Abdullah's emissaries, and the surviving brothers, despairing of the siege, withdrew with their troops to Damascus. Legacy Farhi's residence still stands today in Acre, but it is not open to visitors. Acre also has a square in his honour in the old sector of the city.

The differences‚Äîincluding language, communication styles and world view‚Äîcan create a hurdle to overcome. Rather than allowing the adult to simply share their view, adultcentrism acknowledges the powerlessness and inability of young people to actually affect the systems of authority adults have created.

College of Magic addresses key community concerns at grassroots level. The Director, David Gore, has been with the organization since its inception. It is the current holder of 17 national and 2 international awards. College of Magic graduates perform throughout South Africa and the world. College of Magic is a member of the International Jugglers' Association (IJA). History College of Magic opened its doors on 23 February 1980 and is the only one of its kind in the world. It was established with the aim of providing performance-arts training for aspirant entertainers from all sections of Cape Town's community. In 1992, College of Magic moved into its present home, a renovated Victorian house in Claremont, Cape Town. It was officially opened in 1995 by the Ministry of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology as the Magical Arts Centre. The College ‚Äì with the help of the community ‚Äì has restored the building and developed its facilities for its unique teaching and training needs. Objectives * To provide skills training in the magical and theatrical arts. * To promote and improve leadership potential and excellence. * To offer access to information, performance and employment opportunities, services and resources. * To empower young people, enabling them to gain the respect of their families and community and to promote interaction and moral regeneration. * To inspire students to be creative and productive through developing their skills, thereby contributing to wealth creation and career development. Courses College of Magic is engaged in performing-arts education and training and specializes in training young people ‚Äì children from the age of 10 years and upwards ‚Äì in the art of magic and the allied arts of juggling, ventriloquism, mime and clowning. The unique curriculum consists of six core courses that are structured hierarchically, with each course increasing in complexity, expectations of the learner and skill mastery. In the first three years, students are introduced to the basics of magic including presentation skills, the theory of entertainment and the essential elements of controlling an audience. During the fourth, fifth and sixth years, the curriculum becomes substantially more demanding in terms of the technical requirements and the theoretical aspects of entertaining. Students focus on entertaining children, sleight of hand, close-up magic, stage magic, magic with animals and stage illusions. The courses are geared to encouraging individuality and innovation; hence workshops are frequently included as part of the course, where students can build their own props and experiment with new ideas. The nature of the courses is instructive, where opportunities are fundamental for learners to continually \\"go back\\" ‚Äì i.e. to refine, rehearse, improve and become more competent \\"magical\\" performers at that particular level. Embedded in each course is a cycle of action that includes: * demonstration * practice * presentation * reflection * refinement * practice * presentation. The syllabus of each course is regularly assessed and upgraded wherever necessary. The required standard of performance is monitored closely so that uniformity and excellence are maintained. Lessons are held on Saturday mornings, and tutorials are arranged at other times direct with the instructors. Staff The staff can be segmented into the following categories: 1\\\\. The Non-Executive Board of Management - College of Magic is governed by an experienced board of trustees who are responsible for all decision-making in line with the constitution of the organization. Both their chairperson and their treasurer are graduates of the organisation. The executive director and founder of the College, David Gore, has served the organisation for 27 years. 2\\\\. The Administrative Staff - The administrative staff is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organization. 3\\\\. The Voluntary Teaching Staff - The College started with three teachers. It has since grown to include professional magicians, experienced teachers, specialists in the various allied arts, graduates of the College, administrative staff and visiting lecturers (local and international). The expertise and nurturing approach offered at the College has continued to grow over the years with staff development courses being ongoing. The staff are responsible for all aspects of the courses they are teaching, including syllabus development, lesson preparation, one-on-one tutorial sessions and grading of student progress. The teaching staff is the backbone of the organization, and all 14 members are volunteers. The Magical Arts Centre College of Magic is currently resident in its own premises situated on Lansdowne Road in Claremont Cape Town. These premises were officially opened as the \\"Magical Arts Centre\\" (MAC) on 24 February 1995 by the then Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. The MAC consists of a double-story Victorian house with a wrap-around porch upstairs and downstairs, and is situated on 1840 m2 of property. The building has a very homely feel with a large entrance foyer and a mini-theatre that can comfortably seat forty people. Five rooms are used for teaching purposes and two further rooms are available for tutorials. One of the teaching rooms is a fully equipped video studio which provides an excellent medium for training. There are sound and recording facilities available, as well as limited lighting equipment that is used to provide students with an all-round knowledge of show business. There is a kitchen-come-staff room and four offices, one of which doubles as a reception area. There is a library-come-social room where students can socialise and take out books and videos. This library is one of the largest magic museums in South Africa and houses five collections of books: the Museum Library, the Cape Magician's Circle Library, the Junior Library, the Senior Library and the extensive Staff Library. There is also a collection of videotapes and DVDs, which form an integral part of the teaching process. The building has a courtyard in which the College's animals are kept. There are two large shipping containers in the back garden; one stores an extensive collection of stage illusions, magical props and costumes; the other is a fully equipped workshop for the students and was developed through the sponsorship of the Old Mutual Foundation. Challenges While the human resources of the organization are by far its most valuable asset, there is a desperate need to consolidate and develop its physical resources: * A substantial amount of money is outstanding on the existing building, placing considerable strain on the cash reserves of the organization. * While the building itself has been extensively restored, many necessary items and features are still missing. * Space is at a premium, with the College struggling to accommodate its current student body, project-participants and visitors. The Solution On Tuesday 13 March 2007, the College (007-517 NPO) launched a capital fundraising campaign, entitled \\"13 Magical Milestones\\". The campaign target was set at 1.3 million South African Rand (approx. $186,000 US Dollars), which would cover the costs of constructing and furnishing the \\"Imagination Centre and Secret Garden\\" development, extensive renovations to the existing building and grounds, and the amount owing on the building. The SARMOTI Grant In 1997 the Siegfried & Roy SARMOTI Grant was established enabling disadvantaged young people to join the College and experience the world of magic. Delivered in person by their emissary and coordinator, Lynette Chappell, the Siegfried & Roy SARMOTI Grant heralded a new era for the College of Magic. Called the Magic in the Community project, it allows a group of students to be transported for weekly lessons from their destitute homes in the Cape Flats to the fantasy-fulfilling world of the college. College of Magic Film Documentary In 2007, director Daniel Roth filmed a feature-length documentary about the College; it is entitled \\"Do You Believe In Magic?\\". The film follows the lives of students Lesley and Mfundo as they struggle to realize their dream of winning the College annual competition and so advance to the annual World Teenage Magic Championship in Las Vegas. \\"Do You Believe In Magic?\\" premiered at the Pan African Film Festival in Los Angeles on 9 February 2008 and it was also selected for the 2008 International Film Festival of South Africa.

Biography Litta was born in Milan, a member of the noble Litta family. As a youth he was sent by his parents to the Clementine College in Rome, where he made rapid progress in letters and law. Not long after the completion of his studies he was made prothonotary Apostolic by Pope Pius VI. In 1793 he was consecrated titular Archbishop of Thebes, and sent as nuncio to Poland, where he arrived in March, 1794, shortly before the start of the uprising. Notwithstanding the difficulty of his own position, he used his influence with Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko on behalf of the Catholic Church, and saved the life of Monsignor Wojciech Skarszewski, Bishop of Che≈Çm, already condemned to death for collaborating with Russians. He was not so successful with regard to the Bishop of Vilnius and Livonia Ignacy Jakub Massalski. In the negotiations for the third partition of Poland, he tried to have the three states guarantee the preservation of the Church organization and property -- guarantees which were violated by Catherine II of Russia. On her death Litta was sent on an extraordinary mission to Moscow for the coronation of Paul I of Russia, whence he was transferred as ambassador of Pius VI to St. Petersburg, to settle, according to Paul's wish, the affairs of the Latin and the Greek Catholic Ruthenian (Belarusian and Ukrainian) church. He secured the restoration of six dioceses of the Latin Rite and three of the Ruthenian (Po≈Çacak, Lutsk, and Brest). The restoration of the See of Kiev was prevented by the Russian Holy Synod. Church property was only partly restored, though the government was obliged to establish suitable allowances for the clergy. Litta also induced the metropolitans of Gniezno, Pozna≈Ñ, and Lw√≥w to renounce their jurisdiction over the dioceses of the Latin Rite in Russian occupied territory, these being transferred to the new metropolis of Mahilo≈≠. Through his efforts also the Basilian Order was restored. In April, 1799, he had to leave Russia. On the death of Pius VI he went to Venice to assist at the Papal conclave, 1799‚Äì1800. When he returned to Rome he was given an office in the papal treasury which enabled him to eradicate many abuses and introduce a better administration. In 1801 he was created cardinal and was made Prefect of the Congregation of the Index and, later, of Studies. In 1809 he was expelled from Rome with Pope Pius VII and sent to Saint-Quentin on the Seine. During this exile he translated the Iliad, and wrote a series of letters containing a refutation of the four Gallican Articles of 1682, then the subject of much discussion. Some of these letters were addressed to Napoleon himself, and were later published anonymously. Returning to Rome with Pius VII, Litta was made Prefect of Propaganda, which, under his administration, soon recovered its former status. In 1814 he became suburbicarian Bishop of Sabina, and in 1818 Cardinal Vicar of Rome. He died at Monte Flavio, near Rome, and was buried at Rome in the church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo.

It starts off at Lawrence Road at the base of the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) and is a two-way street throughout, cutting through the Delta and Crown Point neighbourhoods and the City's North End industrial neighbourhood. It ends at Industrial Drive, the site of the Dofasco steel company. This used to be one of the east ends' mountain access roads - it continued south over the train tracks at Lawrence Road and quickly turned right towards the brick manufacturing plant once known as Hamilton Brick. It took several turns before joining what is now the Kenilworth Access near the old water reservoir entrance. Its routing up the mountain is fairly consistent with the current Kenilworth Access with one exception - another hair-pin turn at the top; not the traffic circle that is present now. It was because of these hair-pin turns that the Hamilton Street Railway discontinued bus service on this road in 1944, and why the City planned a new Kenilworth Access to the east which opened in 1957. History Laidlaw United Church, Ottawa Street South Ottawa Street North, Textile district Ottawa Street North, Shopping district In 1862, The city had invested in the Great Western Railway but the government of Canada favoured the rival Grand Trunk Railway. Also, after the end of the Depression (1857‚Äì1862), the population dips downwards in Hamilton and the city could not meet the interest on its bonds, many of which were held by British investors. To save the city from its creditors temporarily, Henry Beasley removes the assessment rolls, thus preventing a levy of special tax. Foundries and machine shops associated with the Great Western Railway failed and several established wholesalers closed their accounts. Daniel C. Gunn's locomotive works went bankrupt, but the manufacturers of farm implements and stoves-the mainstays of iron foundries- were able to weather the crisis. Those owned by Dennis Moore and the Copp brothers endured, but their employees suffered wage cuts and layoffs. Canadian patent laws and the underemployed workers skilled in machinist trades lured an important new industrial enterprise from the U.S.A.- the manufacture of sewing machines by Richard Wanzer. From this development there evolved the ready-made clothing industry, which William Eli Sanford introduced locally. The Textile District evolved in East Hamilton, centered on Ottawa Street and boomed during the First and Second World Wars. In 1913, Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company (based in Cincinnati, Ohio) purchased of land and of water on the south side of Burlington Street between Depew and Ottawa Streets. This event marked the beginning of Procter & Gamble's operations outside of the United States. In 1914, construction started on the Procter & Gamble Hamilton plant, which cost $1 million and consisted of seven buildings: the Crisco building, the boiler house, the gas plant, the soap building, the hardening plant, the kettle and glycerin house, and the machine shop. By 1915, Procter & Gamble officially opens Hamilton plant, employing 75 workers who made six different products. The Tim Hortons chain was founded in Hamilton in 1964. The original store still operates on Ottawa Street. Centre Mall reconstruction project Centre Mall owners announced plans for a 23-building super centre on the property on Barton Street East. Cost is estimated to be around $100-million and will take up of retail space. This will end up being the largest redevelopment project in the history of Hamilton's east-end. The overhaul will take about two-and-a-half years to complete but the bulk of the work is expected to be done by the end of the summer of 2008. Some new buildings will go up before the enclosed mall is torn down. The redevelopment of Centre Mall is transforming the entire neighbourhood from Ottawa to Kenilworth Avenue. The $100-million investment in the mall has boosted Ottawa Street North - already the city's No.1 tourist destination. The garment district has also morphed into a holistic home decor destination area, complete with lighting, antique, design & glass stores. The Ottawa Street B.I.A. had the most application and grants under the commercial property improvement program in 2007 with thirty three and it had an effect on the property values and real estate activity in the district.

The city came into prominence at the time of Gautama Buddha. According to a Buddhist source, it was thirty leagues from Savatthi.DhammapadatthakathƒÅ, iii, 224 After the Gautama Buddha's Mahaparinirvana (passing away) king Ashoka developed this place and installed one of his famous Pillars of Ashoka in the city, from which the elephant capital survives. He also built a stupa and a temple commemorating the visit of the Buddha. This temple exists even today and the ruins of the stupa are also present as a temple of Vishari Devi. It is said that the name Visahari Devi is given to the mother of the Buddha. Descent of the Buddha from the Trayastrimsa Heaven at Sankissa.Marshall p.56 Currently it has ruins of old monasteries and Buddhist monuments. It is rarely visited by pilgrims since it is difficult to go to, and there are not many facilities. After a long time Alexander Cunningham (British) discovered the place in 1842. Eighty-seven years later Sir Anagarika Dharmapala (Sri Lanka) came here on spiritual quest. In 1957 Panditha Madabawita Wijesoma Thero (Sri Lanka) came to 'Sankissa' for few years and started a Buddhist school (Wijesoma Widyalaya) for poor people. Sankissa is now identified with Sankisa Basantapura on the north bank of the Ikkhumati river (Kalinadi), between Kampil and Kannauj, twenty-three miles west of Fatehgarh, twenty-five south of Kaimganj and forty- five north of Kannauj, in Farrukhabad district of Uttar Pradesh state of India. Sankissa at the time of Ramayana It was known as Sankasya Nagar and was ruled by king Kushadhwaja, was a younger brother of Janaka, the father of Sita, the heroine of Ramayana and wife of Lord Rama. Once Sudhanva, supposedly an evil king of Sankasya Nagar, demands the hand of Sita from Janaka. In a war that ensues, Janaka defeats and perhaps kills Sudhanva. He bestows the kingdom of Sankasya to Kushadhwaja. Ancient Buddhist events at Sankassa Sankissa received its fame from statements and claims recorded in the ancient commentaries to the Tipitaka. However, in the Tipitaka itself the events that are supposed to have occurred at Sankissa are not mentioned at all. It was at Sankissa that (according to the commentaries) the Buddha returned to earth, after preaching the Abhidhamma Pitaka in Tavatimsa, following the performance of the Twin Miracle under the Gandamba tree. As the time approached for the Buddha to leave T√°vatimsa, Moggallana (Anuruddha, according to Sutta NipƒÅta Commentary ii 570cf. Visuddhi magga, p. 391) announced his coming return to the multitude, who had been waiting at Savatthi, fed by Culla Anathapindika, while Moggallana expounded the Dhamma. They then made their way to Sankissa. The descent of the Buddha took place on the day of the Mahapavarana festival. Sakka provides three ladders for the Buddha's descent from Sineru to the earth: on the right was a ladder of gold for the gods; on the left a silver ladder for Maha Brahma and his retinue; and in the middle a ladder of jewels for the Buddha. The assembled people covered the earth for thirty leagues round. There was a clear view of the nine Brahma worlds above and of Avici (a hell) below. The Buddha was accompanied by Pa√±casikha, M√°tali, Mah√° Brahm√° and Suy√°ma. Sariputta was the first to welcome him (followed by Uppalavanna,Sutta NipƒÅta Commentary, ii, 570 and the Buddha preached the Law, starting with what was within the comprehension even of a puthujjana, and ending with what only a Buddha could understand. On this occasion was preached the Parosahassa J√°taka to proclaim to the multitude the unparalleled wisdom of S√°riputta. It is said that the Buddha's descent to Sankissa had provided opportunity for Moggall√°na to show his eminence in iddhi, Anuruddha in dibbacakkhu, and Punna in skill in preaching, and the Buddha wished to give Sariputta a chance of shining in his wisdom.JƒÅtaka, ed. Fausboll, iv, 266see also Jh√°nasodhana, Sarabhamiga, and Cand√°bha J√°takas He therefore asked of S√°riputta questions which no one else could answer. The opening words of the S√°riputta Sutta are supposed to refer to this descent from Tusita. The site of the city gate of Sankissa is one of the \\"unchangeable\\" spots of the world (avijahitatthanam).

By 1932, the only portion of this highway that remained was from US 12 to the North Dakota state line. In the early 1950s, SD 15 was rerouted so its southern terminus was at US 12/US 77 in Milbank. It then went north to Hartford Beach, and then west through Wilmot to US 81, before heading north again; the old alignment from US 12 to Wilmot was redesignated as SD 15A. In 1976, the northern terminus was truncated to US 81; the segments of SD 15 near the North Dakota state line became SD 106 and part of a realigned SD 25\\\\. After US 77 was decommissioned in the state in the early 1980s, SD 15 then extended along its former alignment south from Milbank, to the present southern terminus. Major intersectionsRelated routes=Highway 15A= South Dakota Highway 15A (SD 15A) was a short state highway in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of South Dakota. This highway was originally part of the SD 15 mainline. In the early 1950s, the alignment of SD 15 was adjusted to add a segment between Milbank and Wilmot. The old alignment, between U.S. Route 12 (US 12) and Wilmot, was redesignated as SD 15A. In 1976, when many of the suffixed state routes were eliminated, this route was redesignated as SD 123\\\\. =Highway 15Y= South Dakota Highway 15Y (SD 15Y) was a short state highway in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of South Dakota. It was established in the early 1960s, from US 12 in Big Stone City to SD 15 southwest of Shady Beach. In 1976, it was redesignated as SD 109\\\\.

Peters batted and threw right-handed. Biography He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. Peters reached the majors in 1874 with the Chicago White Stockings (NA/NL), spending four years with them before moving to the Milwaukee Grays (NL, 1878), again with Chicago (NL, 1879), and the Providence Grays (NL, 1880), Buffalo Bisons (NL, 1881) and Pittsburgh Alleghenys (NL, 1882‚Äì1884). He was the everyday shortstop of the pennant-winning 1876 Chicago White Stockings in the very first year of the National League. Peters averaged .328 from 1876 to 1878, with a career-high .351 in the 1876 championship season to finish fourth in the National League batting title behind Ross Barnes (.429), George Hall (.366) and Cap Anson (.356). He also twice led the shortstops in putouts in 1879 (280) and 1890 (277). While in Chicago, Peters shared infield defense duties with first basemen Cal McVey and Albert Spalding; 2B Ross Barnes, 3B Cap Anson, and catchers Deacon White and Cal McVey as well.

First appearing in Green Lantern vol. 4 #18 (May 2007), she was created by Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons. Fictional character biography Little is known about the enigmatic Lyssa Drak except that she is from Talok IV, one of the three inhabitable worlds in the Talokian star system in Sector 3500 that Lydea Mallor (Talok VIII), Lyrissa Mallor (Talok VIII), Shadow Lass (Talok VIII) and Mikaal Tomas (Talok III) hail from. How she came to be a member of the Sinestro Corps, which is based in the anti-matter universe on the planet of Qward, is unknown, though it can be assumed she was recruited by Sinestro himself. Drak is also involved in the training of prospective Sinestro soldiers. Once a corpsmen has finished the physical training and was judged by Arkillo, the Sinestro Corps drill sergeant, to be ready for the next phase of training, the new recruit would have their yellow power ring drained of energy and they would enter a Fear Lodge. Within the dark confines of the Fear Lodge, the recruit would have to face their fears and embrace them in order to recharge their ring. If a recruit succeeded, their ring would open the Fear Lodge. If the recruit failed, they would be left inside to die, either from thirst, starvation, suffocation, or suicide. Whatever the recruit's fate, Lyssa Drak was there to record their success or failure in the Book of Parallax. For reasons unknown, this tome, which holds the stories of the greatest Sinestro Corpsmen and tells stories of Despotellis,Green Lantern vol. 4 #18 (March 2007) Karu-Sil,Green Lantern vol. 4 #19 (May 2007) and Bedovian,Green Lantern vol. 4 #20 (July 2007) was chained to Lyssa Drak with yellow energy from Sinestro himself. This was possibly for the need to have a historian for his Corps and a way for Sinestro to revisit his Corps' success. Lyssa Drak is quite loyal to Sinestro and highly devoted to updating the book and keeping it safe. Aside from recording the history of the Sinestro Corps, Lyssa Drak also seems to have some insight as to what will take place for her corps as well. Whether this is actual knowledge of the future or simply plans intended by Sinestro remains to be seen. When introducing herself to Amon Sur, Drak hinted that she had the ability to sense the feelings of others. Lyssa Drak presided over Amon Sur's initiation and helped prepare him for his time in the Fear Lodge. Amon had approached Lyssa for help to purge his fear. Instead, Lyssa read from the Book of Parallax stories of other Sinestro Corps members. Afterwards, Amon entered the Fear Lodge, learned his greatest fear is the Green Lantern Hal Jordan, and successfully ignited the charge in his ring. =Sinestro Corps War= When the Sinestro Corps waged war on the Green Lantern Corps, Green Lanterns John Stewart and Guy Gardner were captured and Lyssa was charged with overseeing their captivity. Hal Jordan, along with fellow Lanterns Graf Toren and Tomar Tu, came to the rescue. Lyssa Drak was grateful for the chance to defeat the three Lanterns, for she wanted to add her own success to the pages of the Book of Parallax. Unfortunately, Drak was defeated herself, and she and the book were placed under Green Lantern custody.Green Lantern vol. 4 #22 (August 2007)Green Lantern vol. 4 #23 (September 2007) While kept in a lantern-powered cage for a time by the married couple Matoo and Amnee Pree, Drak terrifies them with a tale of Kryb, the Yellow Lantern who targets Green Lantern parents, killing them and taking their children. Lyssa frightens the pregnant Amnee with the prediction that Kryb will come for their child on the day it is born. This prompts the couple to take Lyssa back to Oa and a sciencell prison ahead of schedule as Matoo and Amnee decide to lead the hunt for Kryb.Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superboy- Prime (October 2007) =Blackest Night= She is later seen imprisoned on Oa along with several other members of the Sinestro Corps.Green Lantern vol. 4 #26 (December 2007) Several members of the Green Lantern Corps have tried to interrogate her following her capture, but she inevitably tells them a story about her fellow Sinestro Corps members rather than share her secrets. She was awaiting trial on Oa when Scar, the Black Guardian, released the Red Lantern Corps member Vice in the sciencells to provoke a massive riot. In the melee, Lyssa is freed and reunited with her ring. She claims that she can once again feel the Book of Parallax.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #36 (May 2009) While trying to find her precious book, Lyssa discovered instead the Guardian Scar's \\"Book of the Black\\" and hastily attempted to claim it as her own. Unfortunately, she didn't notice Scar's presence and was almost immediately sealed inside the book, looking out of it in horror as Scar turned the page, remarking \\"I hope you enjoy the view from in there\\".Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #37 (June 2009) =Brightest Day= Following Scar's death Ganthet and Guy Gardner discovered the Book of the Black, with Lyssa still trapped within. Guy took a moment to mock Lyssa's predicament before closing the book.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #1 (August 2010) Lyssa is forced to watch every moment of the Blackest Night over and over again as she reveals her greatest fear, which is of the unknown. While lamenting her fate, she is pulled out of the book by the mysterious foe currently capturing the emotional entities. Lyssa is able to recognize the robed stranger, who informs her that her assistance is required since another book will soon be made and a keeper is needed.Untold Tales of Blackest Night (October 2010) Feeling betrayed and abandoned by her fellow corpsmembers after the events of Blackest Night, Lyssa defected from the Sinestro Corps and was later revealed to be the keeper of the Book of the Black. After launching her attack on her former leader, Sinestro, and the \\"New Guardians\\" she is capable of trapping Sinestro himself, Carol Ferris, Indigo-1, Atrocitus, Saint Walker and Larfleeze inside the book. However, Sinestro was able to prevent her from capturing Hal Jordan as well by causing a detonation combining the energy of their rings, but the energy explosion also affected the Book of the Black, which disappeared in a rainbow light, leaving only behind the rings of the six trapped lanterns.Green Lantern vol. 4 #64 (May 2011) =The New 52= Following the War of the Green Lanterns storyline, Lyssa Drak is confronted by the now Green Lantern Sinestro who tracked her with the aid of an energy-manipulating alien hero he fought while in the Sinestro Corps, whose contact with the Book of the Black reveals the Guardians' plan to replace the Corps with the 'Third Army'.Green Lantern vol. 5 #6 (February 2012) Powers and abilities While Lyssa herself is an extremely skilled fighter, an expert survivalist, and learns new things very quickly, as a member of the Sinestro Corps Lyssa possessed a yellow power ring which allowed its wielder to create constructs in the form of whatever objects its bearer can imagine. The power rings also provide flight, force fields and communication. In other media=Film= * Lyssa Drak appears in a few scenes in the animated film Green Lantern: Emerald Knights. Along with Sinestro, she appears among several members of the Sinestro Corps during the scenes that describe Atrocitus' prophecy. =Video games= * Lyssa Drak makes multiple appearances in DC Universe Online. In the villains campaign, the players help Sinestro raid Oa in order to release the Green Lantern Corps' most dangerous villains where they end up having to retrieve Lyssa Drak from an emerald-powered prison. She appears in the hero campaign in Oa where heroes have to battle yellow light constructs, and then Lyssa (a sub boss) and also appears in other raids and alerts throughout the game.

It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856 to mixed reviews, but was strongly endorsed by the critic John Ruskin who proclaimed that in the future it would be recognised as \\"among the world's best masterpieces\\".Ruskin, John, Academy Notes, 1856, Cook and Wedderburn, Ruskin: Complete Writings, vol 14, pp.56-7 The central figure in the painting is a portrait of Millais's wife Effie Gray, who had previously been married to Ruskin. It is now in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.Tate Britain, Millais, 2007, pp. 108-109 Subject There is some evidence that Millais originally intended the painting to be satirical - an attack on pampered officers who were allowed to go home for so-called \\"urgent private affairs\\", while ordinary soldiers were forced to live in poor conditions in the Crimea. When the war ended, the satire seemed obsolete, so he changed it to a portrayal of a wounded officer recuperating at home.Hancher, M. (1991), \\"'Urgent Private Affairs': Millais‚Äôs 'Peace Concluded, 1856'\\", Burlington Magazine, vol. 133, Aug., p. 499. The officer is depicted lying with an Irish wolfhound at his feet, while his wife rests on the sofa, and partly on his lap; behind her head a large myrtle bush sprouts, a traditional symbol of marital fidelity. He has put aside a chapter of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel The Newcomes (the yellow booklet behind his head), which shares the story of a pious military man and his family, to read the newspaper. The two children have been playing with a wooden box in the form of Noah's ark, a popular toy in this period. It contains models of various animals, some of which have been placed on the mother's lap. Each animal symbolises one of the combatants in the Crimean war. The Gallic rooster is the symbol of France; the lion of Britain; the bear of Russia; the turkey of the Ottoman empire (based in Turkey). The child at the left has just picked a dove from the box, symbolising peace.World Myths and Legends in Art; Minneapolis Institute of Arts The rich fabric of the mother's dress creates a large red patch under the toys, suggestive of blood. The girl on the right holds up her father's campaign medal, looking at him questioningly. In the background is a print by James Heath of The Death of Major Peirson by John Singleton Copley, depicting the death of a British officer defending Jersey (Millais's family home) during the Battle of Jersey (1781). Reception Ruskin's elaborate praise of the painting emphasised Millais's increasing mastery of colour, which the critic compared to Titian. Other critics were less impressed. An opponent of the Pre-Raphaelites stated that the \\"coats, hats, trousers\\" all had more vitality than the people.Young, E. (1857), Pre-Raffaelitism, or a Popular Enquiry into Some Newly Asserted Principles Connected with the Philosophy, Poetry, Religion and Revolution of Art London, p. 240 Some of Millais's Pre-Raphaelite colleagues also disliked the picture.\\"Peace Concluded by Millais: An Important Pre-Raphaelite Painting\\", The Minneapolis Institute of Arts Bulletin . Critics were also befuddled as to the physical and apparent emotional closeness of the parents. \\"The agroupment [sic] of the two principle (sic) figures, although probable incident, is not easy. We first lost the extremities of the husband and have to look for them beyond the wife, and then the question arises as to what she is seated on--being upheld by a supposition that she occupies a mysterious space at the edge of the sofa.\\" Upon further research it is possible that part of their closeness represents the closeness of Millais and Gray, as the painting and their first anniversary share the same date. There is evidence that this was not the first time that Millais has inserted his own personal life into one of his paintings.

He was a significant figure in, and source about, the later sessions of the Council of Trent, and much later a candidate for the papacy in 1590, and is now mostly remembered for his De sacris et profanis imaginibus (1582), setting out the Counter-Reformation church's views on the proper role and content of art. Life Paleotti was born at Bologna. Having acquired, in 1546, the title of Doctor of Civil and Canon Law, he was appointed to teach civil law. In 1549 he became a canon of the cathedral, but he did not become a priest until later. He gave up teaching in 1555, and although he had turned down office as a bishop, he became in 1556 \\"Auditor\\" or judge of the Roman Rota, the supreme Catholic ecclesiastical court, moving to Rome. Pope Pius IV sent him to the Council of Trent, where he played an important role, as a mediator between reformers and conservatives.Olmi His Diarium, or journal, on the proceedings of the council, forms one of the most important documents for its history. The complete text is published in the third volume of the Concilium Tridentinum.Diariorum, Actorum, Epistularum, tractatuum nova collectio, edidit Societas Goerresiana (Freiburg; Vol. 1, ed. S. Merkle, p. XXXVI, Freiburg, 1901.A r√©sum√© was published by Mendham (London, 1842) and Augustin Theiner (Acta Concilii Tridentini, Agram, 1874, II, 523-580). After the council Paleotti became one of the commission of cardinals and prelates that served as a basis of the Congregation of the Council. On 12 March 1565, he became cardinal, and on 13 January 1567, was made Bishop of Bologna; he was made the latter's first archbishop, when in 1582 that see became an archdiocese. His early biographers praise his introduction of the Tridentine reforms in his diocese, comparing his activity at Bologna to that of Charles Borromeo at Milan, but Prodi's biography emphasizes his frustrations, struggling with an inadequate staff and unconcerned clergy, as well as difficulties caused by the Papal governors of Bologna, which was part of the Papal States.Prodi, via Gilbert, Dennis p. 85, and other reviews In 1589 Paleotti became Cardinal-Bishop of Albano and in 1590 Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina, both suburbicarian sees near Rome traditionally held by senior cardinals, and moved to Rome.Olmi There also he distinguished himself by his zeal for reform, although it was becoming clear that his moderate stance was not being followed by the church.Olmi His support for the rights of bishops and cardinals against the increasing absolutism of the Popes and Curia brought him into conflict with Pope Sixtus V,Gilbert, 1660 but at the next conclave in 1590, which elected Pope Gregory XIV, he obtained the votes of an important minority. He died in Rome in 1597, a rather disappointed figure in his hopes for the church and church art, and is buried in Bologna Cathedral. Writings on art Paleotti was, with Molanus and Cardinal Charles Borromeo, one of the most influential writers to write filling out the brief decree of the Council on religious images with detailed instructions on their iconography. He did not become greatly interested in art until the 1570s, when he began work on his Discorso intorno alle imagine sacre et profane, consulting scholars and artists such as Prospero Fontana, Domenico Tibaldi and Pirro Ligorio. The Discorso was projected as a work in five books, but never completed. Two volumes and tables of contents for the rest were published in Italian in 1582 in what was intended as a provisional text, not properly revised. The work began with a consideration of the functions of religious and secular art, drawing on classical, biblical and patristic writings, and generally awarding a high place to the role of art and the position of the artist, always guided by the church.Book 1 Book II discussed specific issues of iconography in religious art. Following the council, he proscribed as sin any frivolity, indecorum, and use of traditional depictions without scriptural foundation. Unlike some clerical writers, he covered secular art, demanding Catholic standards of morality and decorum in that too, though he admitted to a correspondent that artists might be under financial pressures to produce \\"immoral\\" works. He rejected the excesses of Mannerism and supported naturalistic styles that were historically accurate and easy for the simple viewer to understand, and so represented \\"silent preaching\\".Discorsi, Book 1, chapters 21-24 compare the Christian painter to an orator, and explain his usefulness to religion. The plans for books III-V were to cover respectively secular art, saints and the Trinity in art, and the decoration of buildings, with closing \\"exhortations to the clergy, patrons and painters\\".Olmi The early religious paintings of Ludovico Carracci, working in Bologna in these years, perhaps came closest to Paleotti's prescription, but the Baroque was to take Catholic art in other directions. An attempt by one scholar to demonstrate direct influence by Paleotti's work on the movement to naturalism in the style of Annibale Carracci failed to convince most art historians, as there was no actual evidence documenting any connection.Jones, 36 The text was never completed, with a Latin edition of essentially the unrevised first two books published in Ingolstadt in 1594. Revisions done in Rome in the 1590s, and fragmentary drafts of the last three books survive. Despite being incomplete the work was widely read in the Catholic world,Olmi and the first English translation was published in 2012. In the 1590s, the tone of the disappointed Paleotti's writing changed, becoming harsher, and he proposed an equivalent for imagery of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.Olmi He is also the probable commissioner of Zurburan's 1636-1639 Saint Lawrence. A key book on Paleotti was written by Paolo Prodi, titled Il Cardinale Gabriele Paleotti (1522‚Äì1597), 2 vols. (Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1967. David A.

In the Middle English period, a franklin was simply a freeman; that is, a man who was not a serf. In the feudal system under which people were tied to land which they did not own, serfs were in bondage to a member of the nobility who owned that land. The surname \\"Fry\\", derived from the Old English \\"frig\\" (\\"free born\\"), indicates a similar social origin. The meaning of the word \\"franklin\\" evolved to mean a freeholder; that is, one who holds title to real property in fee simple. In the 14th and 15th centuries, franklin was \\"the designation of a class of landowners ranking next below the landed gentry\\".Oxford English Dictionary With the definite end of Feudalism, this social class disappeared as a distinct entity. The legal provisions for \\"a free man\\" were applied to the general population. The memory of that class was preserved in the use of \\"Franklin\\" as a surname. Etymology According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \\"franklin\\" is derived from Middle English franklen, frankeleyn, francoleyn, from Anglo-Latin francalanus a person owning francalia, \\"territory held without dues\\". Collins mentions the Anglo-French fraunclein, \\"a landowner of free, but not noble birth\\", from Old French franc free + -lein, \\"-ling\\", formed on the model of \\"chamberlain\\". All these go back to Late Latin francus \\"free\\" or \\"a free man\\", from Frankish *Frank, \\"a freeman\\", literally, \\"a Frank\\"; cognate with Old High German Franko. Significance The social class of franklin, meaning (latterly) a person not only free (not in feudal servitude) but also owning the freehold of land, and yet not even a member of the \\"landed gentry\\" (knights, esquires and gentlemen, the lower grades of the upper class) let alone of the nobility (barons, viscounts, earls/counts, marquis, dukes), evidently represents the beginnings of a real-property-owning middle class in England during the 14th and 15th centuries. Note that the land and property owned by this English middle class might well be in a rural area. This is one factor distinguishing this class from the mainland European bourgeoisie, a social class whose name means \\"town- dwellers\\". Magna Carta Magna Carta gave rights to free men and the peasantry. \\"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled. Nor will we proceed with force against him. Except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.\\" https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19744823 Appearance in literature * A franklin is one of the characters in The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. * Cedric of Rotherwood, a character in the historical novel Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott, is a franklin. * Georgette Heyer uses the term in her novel The Conqueror (1931), which is set in 11th-century Falaise, Normandy. * The English translation of Sigrid Undset's The Master of Hestviken tetralogy, about medieval Norway, names the books' protagonist \\"a franklin\\". While not precisely identical to the English class, the Norwegian equivalent was also a class of landowners, often enjoying substantial properties and prestige, but no title of any kind. Modern usage Unlike some other terms referring to social class or status in medieval England such as esquire and gentleman, franklin has no modern usage other than as a historical reference to the Middle Ages. Several English surnames are thought to derive from this class of people. They developed in the Middle Ages as a status surname, indicating a 'free man'. They derived from the Old French feudal term franchomme; composed of the elements 'franc' (in its original meaning 'free') and 'homme', man, from the Latin 'homo'. The various spellings gradually altered because of association with such common English placename suffixes such as '-combe' and '-ham'.

It is the tenth or eleventh year of compulsory education. It is approximately equivalent to ninth grade, \\"freshman year,\\" or \\"Second year\\" in the US, and grade nine in Canada. It is the second to last year of compulsory education. Bangladesh In schools in Bangladesh Year 10 or Class Ten (X) is the tenth year after Kindergarten. It is the tenth full year of compulsory education, with children being admitted who are aged 15 by 1 September in any given academic year. Year 10 is usually the fourth year of Secondary school. During this year or by the end of Year 10, all qualifying students complete Secondary school. Australia In Australia, Year 10 is the eleventh year of compulsory education. Although there are slight variations between the states, most children in Year 10 are aged between fifteen and sixteen. Year 10 is the final year of compulsory education in Australia. Students may elect to opt out of the education program at this point. This leaves the student without a VCE certificate (similar certificates apply in other states), and most choose to attend TAFE or enter an apprenticeship. Until recently, students that completed Year 10 in New South Wales would obtain their School Certificate. New Zealand In New Zealand, Year 10 is the tenth full year of compulsory education. Children entering Year 10 are usually aged between 13.5 and 15, but there is no minimum age. Year 10 pupils are educated in Secondary schools or in Area schools. United Kingdom=England= In schools in England Year 10 is the tenth year after Reception. It is the tenth full year of compulsory education, with children being admitted who are aged 14 before 1 September in any given academic year. It is the first year of Key Stage 4 in which the secondary National Curriculum is taught and most GCSE courses are begun. Year 10 is usually the fourth year of Secondary school and was previously called the \\"fourth year\\" or \\"fourth form\\". In some areas of England, with three-tier education it is the second or third year group of Secondary school. =Wales= In schools in Wales Year 10 is the tenth year after Reception.

It is the first year group in Key Stage 4. =Northern Ireland= In Northern Ireland Year 10 is the third year of secondary education. Children in Year 10 are aged between 13 and 14. It is the third and final year of Key Stage 3. =Scotland= In schools in Scotland Year 10 is known as Third year which is the third year of secondary education. Third year, also known as S3, is the third year of schooling in Scottish secondary schools. Most pupils are 14 or 15 years old at the end of S3. Traditionally it would be the year that pupils start their Standard Grade courses. As of 2013, it is standard for schools to continue to offer a broad general education course mixed with National 3 - National 5 work. At the end of S3, pupils usually choose subjects in which they will work on in their Fourth year to sit National 3, 4 or 5. Standard Grade courses are no longer taught in Scottish secondary schools. All schools must follow the ever changing 'Curriculum for Excellence'. India In India, Year 10 (known as Class 9 or Standard 9) is usually the tenth year of compulsory education. It is the 1st year in High School, with standard 10 or class 10 as the second and final year in high school. It is also known as Matriculation and makes the students eligible for attending Pre-University Certificate course (or popularly called PUC or class 12th) which in turn will make them eligible to attend college.

It was first stated by Leonid Kantorovich in 1948. It is similar to the form of the Banach fixed-point theorem, although it states existence and uniqueness of a zero rather than a fixed point. Newton's method constructs a sequence of points that under certain conditions will converge to a solution x of an equation f(x)=0 or a vector solution of a system of equation F(x)=0. The Kantorovich theorem gives conditions on the initial point of this sequence. If those conditions are satisfied then a solution exists close to the initial point and the sequence converges to that point.  Assumptions  Let X\\\\subset\\\\R^n be an open subset and F:X \\\\subset \\\\R^n \\\\to\\\\R^n a differentiable function with a Jacobian F^{\\\\prime}(\\\\mathbf x) that is locally Lipschitz continuous (for instance if F is twice differentiable). That is, it is assumed that for any open subset U\\\\subset X there exists a constant L>0 such that for any \\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y\\\\in U :\\\\F'(\\\\mathbf x)-F'(\\\\mathbf y)\\\\\\\\le L\\\\;\\\\\\\\mathbf x-\\\\mathbf y\\\\ holds. The norm on the left is some operator norm that is compatible with the vector norm on the right. This inequality can be rewritten to only use the vector norm. Then for any vector \\\\mathbf v\\\\in\\\\R^n the inequality :\\\\F'(\\\\mathbf x)(\\\\mathbf v)-F'(\\\\mathbf y)(\\\\mathbf v)\\\\\\\\le L\\\\;\\\\\\\\mathbf x-\\\\mathbf y\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\mathbf v\\\\ must hold. Now choose any initial point \\\\mathbf x_0\\\\in X. Assume that F'(\\\\mathbf x_0) is invertible and construct the Newton step \\\\mathbf h_0=-F'(\\\\mathbf x_0)^{-1}F(\\\\mathbf x_0). The next assumption is that not only the next point \\\\mathbf x_1=\\\\mathbf x_0+\\\\mathbf h_0 but the entire ball B(\\\\mathbf x_1,\\\\\\\\mathbf h_0\\\\) is contained inside the set X. Let M\\\\le L be the Lipschitz constant for the Jacobian over this ball. As a last preparation, construct recursively, as long as it is possible, the sequences (\\\\mathbf x_k)_k, (\\\\mathbf h_k)_k, (\\\\alpha_k)_k according to :\\\\begin{alignat}{2} \\\\mathbf h_k&=-F'(\\\\mathbf x_k)^{-1}F(\\\\mathbf x_k)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0.4em] \\\\alpha_k&=M\\\\,\\\\F'(\\\\mathbf x_k)^{-1}\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\mathbf h_k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0.4em] \\\\mathbf x_{k+1}&=\\\\mathbf x_k+\\\\mathbf h_k. \\\\end{alignat}  Statement  Now if \\\\alpha_0\\\\le\\\\tfrac12 then #a solution \\\\mathbf x^* of F(\\\\mathbf x^*)=0 exists inside the closed ball \\\\bar B(\\\\mathbf x_1,\\\\\\\\mathbf h_0\\\\) and #the Newton iteration starting in \\\\mathbf x_0 converges to \\\\mathbf x^* with at least linear order of convergence. A statement that is more precise but slightly more difficult to prove uses the roots t^\\\\ast\\\\le t^{**} of the quadratic polynomial : p(t) =\\\\left(\\\\tfrac12L\\\\F'(\\\\mathbf x_0)^{-1}\\\\^{-1}\\\\right)t^2 -t+\\\\\\\\mathbf h_0\\\\ , :t^{\\\\ast/**}=\\\\frac{2\\\\\\\\mathbf h_0\\\\}{1\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{1-2\\\\alpha}} and their ratio : \\\\theta =\\\\frac{t^*}{t^{**}} =\\\\frac{1-\\\\sqrt{1-2\\\\alpha}}{1+\\\\sqrt{1-2\\\\alpha}}. Then #a solution \\\\mathbf x^* exists inside the closed ball \\\\bar B(\\\\mathbf x_1,\\\\theta\\\\\\\\mathbf h_0\\\\)\\\\subset\\\\bar B(\\\\mathbf x_0,t^*) #it is unique inside the bigger ball B(\\\\mathbf x_0,t^{*\\\\ast}) #and the convergence to the solution of F is dominated by the convergence of the Newton iteration of the quadratic polynomial p(t) towards its smallest root t^\\\\ast, if t_0=0,\\\\,t_{k+1}=t_k-\\\\tfrac{p(t_k)}{p'(t_k)}, then #:\\\\\\\\mathbf x_{k+p}-\\\\mathbf x_k\\\\\\\\le t_{k+p}-t_k. #The quadratic convergence is obtained from the error estimate #: \\\\\\\\mathbf x_{n+1}-\\\\mathbf x^*\\\\ \\\\le \\\\theta^{2^n}\\\\\\\\mathbf x_{n+1}-\\\\mathbf x_n\\\\ \\\\le\\\\frac{\\\\theta^{2^n}}{2^n}\\\\\\\\mathbf h_0\\\\. Corollary In 1986, Yamamoto proved that the error evaluations of the Newton method such as Doring (1969), Ostrowski (1971, 1973), Gragg-Tapia (1974), Potra-Ptak (1980), Miel (1981), Potra (1984), can be derived from the Kantorovich theorem. Generalizations There is a q-analog for the Kantorovich theorem. For other generalizations/variations, see Ortega & Rheinboldt (1970). Applications Oishi and Tanabe claimed that the Kantorovich theorem can be applied to obtain reliable solutions of linear programming.  References  Further reading  * John H.

The track features low banking in the turns and long straightaways. It has a layout similar to Martinsville Speedway. Plans for a half-mile dirt track in Sandusky were first drawn up in 1948 by Tommy Warren. In 1950 the Lake Erie Stock Coupe Racing Association (LESCRA) purchased the land and the first race was held on May 14 of that year. Richard Brickly of Willard, Ohio won the race in a 1932 Ford coupe and received $103 in prizemoney. The track was paved over in 1955 and a steel grandstand (replacing the old wooden stands) was added on the front straightaway, increasing the seating capacity from 3,500 to 5,000. The track was resurfaced in 2003. Sandusky Speedway closed at the end of the 1969 season when the Decker family, then the current owners, elected to shut down the facility. It lay dormant for all of 1970 until a lease agreement was reached allowing the facility to re-open the following year. It has operated continuously since. History and affiliations The speedway has enjoyed two brief affiliations with NASCAR in its history. Some NASCAR-sanctioned races were held at the track in 1952 and from 1987 to 1994, Sandusky Speedway ran events in what is now known as the Whelen All-American Series. In 2008, the track hosted the ARCA Lincoln Welders Truck Series for the first time. Sandusky Speedway hosted weekly competition in Spectator Stock (an entry level division with four- and six-cylinder passenger cars with automatic transmissions), Street Stock, Sportsman, Modified and Sprint Car classes until the 2012 season when the Spectator Stock division and Sportman division were removed from the weekly racing schedule. In 2012 the speed plant went to a 3 division line up which included the Modified Division, Street Stock division and either the Buckeye Super Sprints, Ohio Late Models, Main Event Racing Series or the Supermodifieds rotating on the schedule. The Main Event Super Late 'Outlaw' Bodied Series Championships XXVI (25) was held at the track after being held in Columbus in previous years. 2013 saw another shake up in the weekly racing schedule. Officials disbanded the Ohio Late Model series and added a Hobby Stock division, similar to the Spectator Stock division however without racing enhancements - keeping the cars stock and prohibiting racing tires, racing engine parts, any changes to the stock car parts, etc. During the season and a week before the 36th Annual Hy-Miler, weather hit the track hard with heavy rainfalls - once the rain had passed officials spent several days pumping water out of the turns, in-field, pits and parking area. It is estimated that 3.7 million gallons were pumped off the property. It serves as an important hub for Supermodified racing, hosting an annual round of the International Supermodified Association (ISMA) as well as three rounds each year of the Midwest Supermodified Association (MSA) championship. The importance of this series is such that Oswego Speedway in New York - considered the home of Supermodified racing - is closed when the MSA races come to Sandusky. In turn, Sandusky Speedway closes on the weekend of the annual Oswego Classic.

He was made cardinal-deacon on February 20, 1193, then cardinal priest of Santa Prisca in May 1193 and finally cardinal bishop of Sabina at the end of 1204 (subscribed as bishop for the first time on January 9, 1205). He is often referred to as a member of the powerful Roman Colonna family, but modern scholars have established that this is based on a lie from the beginning of 16th century. More likely he was nephew of Celestine III and member of the Bobone family. He studied medicine at Amalfi. Biography Giovanni (\\"John\\" in English) rose to influence in the curia during the pontificate of Celestine III. According to Roger of Hoveden, he was nominated by Celestine III to succeed him in 1198, but appears to have received cardinal priesthood of Santa Prisca as a consolation prize from Celestine's successor Innocent III; however, since he was actually appointed to that rank in 1193, this story seems to be inaccurate. Innocent employed him on many legatine missions to Germany, Spain, Sicily, and France. He was also grand penitentiary. In 1200 he was in France with Cardinal Octavian to deal with Philip Augustus' divorce. From there Innocent sent him from there into Languedoc to act as papal legate to work for the suppression of Catharism. He delivered a revised version of the decretal Vergentis in senium, first issued by Innocent in March 1199 for Viterbo in the Papal States. The Languedocian version of the decretal was considerably less harsh, omitting a clause calling for the dispossession of the Catholic heirs of heretics. It was probably for his work in Languedoc that he was elevated to the suburbicarian bishopric of Sabina in 1204. He was the powerful friend of Francis of Assisi and was instrumental in obtaining papal approval of the Franciscan Rule. He died at Rome. He is remembered at Amalfi for his munificence in building and endowing a spacious hospital there. ReferencesSources *Graham-Leigh, Elaine. The Southern French Nobility and the Albigensian Crusade.

Williams and Puerto Rican singer Chayanne. Plot After burying his mother, Rafael Infante (Chayanne) comes from Santiago, Cuba to Houston, Texas to work for a man named John Burnett (Kris Kristofferson) as a handyman in Burnett's dance studio. It soon becomes clear to the audience that Burnett is the father Rafael never knew. While there he finds himself falling for a dancer and instructor Ruby Sinclair (Vanessa L. Williams), who incidentally brought him to the studio. It turns out that the dancers in the studio are preparing for a dance competition in Las Vegas and that Ruby would be taking part as well. Rafael gets close to Ruby and their attraction to each other grows, but she is not willing to commit herself to a relationship as she seems more interested in her dancing. Meanwhile, Rafael's arrival and persona wins him the friendship of an older dancer Bea Johnson (Joan Plowright) as well as the studio receptionist Lovejoy (Beth Grant), but it also causes some discomfort to Burnett, who suddenly begins to withdraw into himself and takes less interest in the preparations for the competition, much to the chagrin of his own partner Patricia Black (Jane Krakowski). While visiting Burnett at his home, Rafael notices and offers to repair his old and broken-down truck. He and Ruby go downtown to get the parts needed to repair the truck and are invited to an engagement party by a Cuban man whose daughter was getting engaged. While there, both of them discover more about each other as he tells her that his mother had died but that he never knew his father. Later, Rafael invites Ruby to a dance party at a club in the city and they agree to go on the following Saturday night. Before leaving, Rafael helps Patricia learn a dance lift she had been practicing, explaining that his mother made him take a little ballet. The following Saturday, he and Ruby go to the party in which they perform, along with other dancers, the Latin Salsa dancing to a song by Albita Rodriguez. After the party, he takes Ruby home where he discovers that she has a 7-year-old son Peter (Chaz Oswill) who is \\"looked after\\" by Bea in Ruby's absence and who happens to be fathered by Ruby's former dance partner, Julian Marshall (Rick Valenzuela). While there, he comes up to Ruby and they share a passionate kiss, but she eventually breaks it up. Later on Rafael comes to Burnett's home to show him the refurbished truck, to the latter's delight. while there, Patricia comes to the house and has a discussion with John asking him to explain why he suddenly lost interest in their choreography preparations. John then tells her that she can dance with Rafael if she wants and both she and Rafael start their practice to the amazement of the other dancers at the studio. After the rehearsal, Rafael overhears John telling Lovejoy that Ruby would be in Las Vegas without them and also asking her to switch his name with Rafael's when Patricia's dance comes up. Sensing that she wants to reunite with Julian, Rafael goes to see Ruby who explains that she wanted Peter to see his father often and that she did not want to be in love. While at a fishing trip with Burnett, Rafael is shocked when Burnett tells him to go back to Cuba after the competition and that he did not have a son. Devastated by the double rejection, he decides to return to Cuba after his dance with Patricia. At Las Vegas, Rafael meets Ruby and tells her that he was returning to Cuba after the competition. Burnett (who did not go) reflects on his cruel rejection of Rafael and decides to come to the dance to apologize to Rafael and persuade him not to go back to Cuba. Rafael dances with Patricia and while watching them, Ruby realized that she was in love with Rafael and felt a stab of jealousy seeing them together. Just as Rafael and Patricia leave the stage, Bea comes in, saying, \\"I wanna do that too\\" and she and Rafael perform a very humorous dance to the amusement and delight of the crowd. After the dance, Burnett meets and apologizes to Rafael, eventually convinces him to stay back and also commending his dancing. The main dances begin and Ruby and her partner Julian are involved. Despite the slight tension between them, they win the competition although Ruby almost all the time seems to keep her eyes on Rafael, who is in the audience and who is watching her, however he leaves and when Ruby looked around without seeing him, she breaks down in tears. Later at a dance party for all the contestants, Ruby is met by a man who wishes to promote her. However, to her relief, Rafael appears again and leads her to the dance floor for a final dance scene that has the rest of the dancers watching with admiration. The movie ends at the studio with the entire studio members and some new dancers dancing to the theme song \\"You Are My Home\\" by Chayanne and Williams themselves. Cast *Vanessa L.

Episodes center around the crew of the spaceship Nautilus, led by Captain Nemo, in an attempt to liberate Earth and other planets from the control of Master Phantom. The series aired on UPN from September 10 to December 3, 1995. Action sequences were shown in \\"Strikervision\\" 3-D. The French version of the series was titled 20 000 Lieues dans l'espace (translation: \\"20,000 Leagues in Space\\"). Plot Space Strikers has a single continuous plot running through all twelve episodes. The universe is inhabited by humans and a variety of other space-faring species. They are under threat from the mostly-robotic armies of Master Phantom, a human cyborg who believes Captain Nemo left him to die. Earth and multiple other planets have already been conquered at the start of the first episode. Members of various other species join the human crew of the Nautilus to fight back, including an anthropomorphic wolf, an anthropomorphic dolphin, a Cupid- like creature, and a variety of robots. Due to their previous friendship and shared academy training, Captain Nemo and Master Phantom attempting to outwit each other is recurrent theme in the show. Strikervision At various times in an episode, a small green icon appears in the corner of the screen to alert the viewer to put on 3D glasses. Early 3D sequences typically feature repeated background and foreground images moving in opposite directions over the characters or ships on screen, giving the illusion of rotation or movement. Later instances of 3-D imagery often show spaceships flying past the screen, made possible by the show's use of 3D computer graphics for many of its spacecraft.

It has a right to confer doctoral degrees. Half of the students in the Hertie School come from abroad (with more than 95 countries represented among alumni and currently enrolled students), and the working language is English. Predominantly, Hertie's students have backgrounds in law, economics, political science and international relations and pursue a Master of Public Policy or Master of International Affairs degree. The school offers its students the opportunity to complete a \\"professional year\\" at a multinational corporation, government ministry or an international organization. In addition to this possibility, research collaboration with faculty is encouraged. The Hertie School also offers an Executive Masters of Public Administration. South West Wing of the Hertie School Students can pursue study abroad opportunities at one of the Hertie School's nearly 30 academic partners worldwide. The research focus of the Hertie School, which has existed since its founding, lies in the analysis of the conditions, structures and dynamics of governance. History The Hertie School was founded by the Hertie Foundation, located in Frankfurt. The school was established in 2003 as one of the first European professional schools for public policy. In February 2005, the Hertie School was awarded state recognition as college of higher education by the Berlin Ministry of Science, Research, and Culture (Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur). The work of the Hertie School is based on four pillars: Research, Degree Programmes (Master of Public Policy, Master of International Affairs, Executive Master of Public Administration, and the Berlin School for Transnational Studies), Executive Education, and Knowledge Transfer. In October 2017, the Hertie School once again received full accreditation to confer doctoral degrees for another ten years. In February 2019, the Hertie School announced that it would move to the Robert Koch Forum from summer 2022 to enable its growth plans. The historic Robert Koch Forum is currently being renovated by the city of Berlin with a budget of 42.5 million euros.

The programme is intended for students pursuing a future career dealing professionally with problems of modern governance, international relations, advanced economics and politics. Upon completion of the two-year programme, students receive the Master of Public Policy (MPP). Prospective students have typically studied economics, law or political science, but candidates from every field of study apply for admission. The Master of International Affairs (MIA) programme, a new programme added in fall 2015, focuses on international relations. It prepares for positions requiring a profound understanding of today's global policy challenges. The Executive Master of Public Administration (EMPA) programme is aimed at experienced professionals for whom cooperation between government, business and civil society is an important part of their work. Participants in the Executive MPA programme choose an individual area of concentration and can either study full-time over a period of one year or complete the programme over a period of two years if they wish to study part-time while working. Prospective students must have at least two years' professional work experience, as well as an educational background in economics, law or social sciences.

Capable of playing in defence and midfield, McAnespie represented Scotland at under-21 level and has played in the Scottish Premier League for St Johnstone and Hearts. Playing career McAnespie graduated from the youth ranks at St Johnstone, making his first team d√©but against Clydebank on 4 February 1997. He made one further appearance that season as Saints won promotion to the Premier Division. He scored on both occasions. He went on to make 50 league appearances for the Saints, notably scoring in wins against both Celtic and Rangers in the 1998‚Äì99 season. In 1998, McAnespie was one of four younger players asked to accompany the Scottish national side to the 1998 FIFA World Cup to gain experience. He was already a member of the Scotland U21 side and Craig Brown's idea was designed to ease the transition of younger players into the full national side. McAnespie, however, would never gain a full international call-up. McAnespie joined Fulham in 2000, for a reported fee of ¬£80,000. Considered an investment for the future, he managed only two League Cup appearances during his three years with the London side. This period was punctuated by brief loan spells with Hearts and Bournemouth. At Bournemouth he scored once against Bristol City. Upon returning to Fulham, he spent the rest of the season playing in the reserve team. McAnespie would recall his disappointment at his loan spell at Bournemouth. He was released in early 2003 and turned out four times for Paul Sturrock's Plymouth Argyle at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season before returning to Scotland with Falkirk. Having returned to Scottish football, McAnespie spent several short, injury-disrupted spells with lower division clubs. He left Falkirk in October 2004 to return to St Johnstone, before joining Ayr United in January 2006. He rejected Ayr's offer to re-sign in the summer and instead joined Alloa Athletic. On 21 June 2007, McAnespie was sold by Alloa to Greenock Morton for a five figure fee (rumoured to be ¬£11,750). At Morton he scored his first and only goal for the club against Partick Thistle. In the summer of 2008, McAnespie went on trial with Wycombe Wanderers, where he scored against Flackwell Heath, but was unsuccessful in getting a move to the Chairboys, and remained with Morton for a further season. This included a loan spell at near-neighbours Third Division side Dumbarton, until the end of the season. Sadly for McAnespie, he injured himself again after only one game for Dumbarton so spent most of his time at the Rock on the sidelines. McAnespie was released after the end of the 2008‚Äì2009 season, as confirmed by Davie Irons on 8 May in the Greenock Telegraph. McAnespie's time in retirement was short, with Arbroath picking him up on a one-year contract for the 2010‚Äì11 season. In June 2012, he joined Stirling Albion, having been released by Arbroath at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. On 4 April 2014, McAnespie left Stirling Albion due to work commitments. McAnespie signed for Junior side Kilbirnie Ladeside in July 2014. He then moved onto Petershill before a coaching stint at Glenafton. Coaching career McAnespie was a coach at junior club Glenafton in 2016. Managerial career On 19 January 2017, McAnespie was appointed manager of Clydebank.http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/clydebank- appoint-ex-st-johnstone-9654891 After a torrid start to his managerial career, McAnespie guided his side to six wins in a row in the final matches of the season and won promotion to the top flight. After leaving Clydebank in 2019, he was assistant manager of Cumbernauld United until April 2020 where he was named named manager to take them into the new West of Scotland Football League.

Other cast members include Adrian Paul and Amy Locane. It was filmed entirely in Denver, Colorado. Plot Financial analyst Tom Weaver (Grayson McCouch) is a troubled man. He has recently broken off a potential affair with a co-worker named Rebecca. He is also arguing with himself if he wants to continue with a shady ten million dollar business deal with his boss. He has also discovered identical motel keys in his wife, Molly's purse and his boss's car, leading him to believe that she is having an affair. He confronts her about it and she denies this. He lies to her about where he is going and heads to his building to complete the deal to hopefully get himself rich. Under heavy levels of stress, Tom shouts at the kind old security guard, Eddie, before going into the building. At midnight, Tom goes five levels down in the building's underground parking garage to E-6. Tom argues with his boss about it, who tells him that he has gotten in too deep to back out now, as millions would be lost should the process be interrupted. Tom quits the deal and leaves to his car. He tries to call his wife when he discovers that he is too deep in the garage to get service. Tom discovers that his car has been vandalized and left immobile. Tom realizes he's not alone. Watching and waiting, a massive, 6000 pound second generation Chevrolet K5 Blazer SUV whose driver sits hidden behind a veil of tinted glass. The driver is a psychotic killer with only one goal: Not letting Tom get out alive. the driver at first taunts him, chasing him, honking the horn, and flashing its lights, and Tom goes to the stairwell. However, it has been chained shut from the inside. Worse yet, the elevators are shut down for the night. Tom finds a fellow co-worker who is leaving and begs for a ride. Frightened, the woman maces him and flees. Armed with only a tire iron, Tom goes into the bathroom to wash the pepper spray out of his eyes, and discovers that the driver has attached a hose to the truck's exhaust pipe, and Tom flees his only safe place, which is quickly filling up with deadly carbon monoxide gas. Tom goes to a nearby truck where the driver appears and tries to mow him down with their truck. He manages to get away from the truck by hiding behind a construction truck. He climbs on top of the construction truck and manages to climb on top of the truck, where he discovers the dead body of the woman who had earlier maced him. The truck's driver is willing to kill anybody who gets in the way of their goal. Tom realizes that he must outwit his pursuer and escape the garage while trying to figure out who wants him dead before it is too late. The driver realizes that Tom is on top of the car and bucks him into another car, before ramming it into the wall. Tom manages to flee and discover a repo man who also sees him as a threat, since he is really a carjacker. The repo man attempts to attack him, but he is thrown onto construction equipment and is impaled on nails. Tom believes the man is the driver, but he was actually the only man who could help him. The carjacker shoots his pistol empty and attempts to tell Tom how he can start the car but he dies before he can get the information out. Tom takes the empty pistol and some other tools and the path of the oncoming truck and hides in a parked car, which he breaks into using some tools. He then sees Victor, the other security guard who knows his would-be mistress, Rebecca and appears to have a grudge against him. Victor sees the damage and attempts to arrest him, but Tom threatens him, right before Victor is mowed down by the truck. Tom flees and is nearly crushed behind a wall by the truck. A paranoid and terrified Tom realizes anybody could be a suspect. He escapes and manages to call Eddie on Victor's walkie talkie. He hears a loud crash and the line goes dead, leading him to believe that Eddie has too been killed. He steals a gun from his boss's car and finds his boss, who has been stabbed and tells him that his wife never went through with the affair, which she had no part in. He dies right as he tells Tom that he has made sure that he will not be leaving the garage alive. A suspenseful game of cat and mouse ensues as the huge truck chases him through the garage's levels. Tom continues to hide and flee from the truck, before eventually hiding under the truck, which backs into his leg, pinning him to the ground. The killer is revealed to be Eddie, who realized that Tom was only pretending to like him, when everyone else didn't bother to mask their dislike for him. Combined with his long hours and stress from being lonely, Eddie snapped and killed everyone, saving Tom for last. The garage doors open and Molly comes inside. Tom, despite a broken leg, manages to rescue Molly, who had been bound and gagged inside the toll booth, right before Eddie smashes it with the truck. Eddie is about to run them both down right as the police, whom Tom had called earlier at the top where there was cell phone service, arrive. Tom makes sure Molly is safe before borrowing a police car to finally destroy the truck with. He totals the truck, grabs a gun, and prepares to shoot Eddie through the windshield. The police stop this and open the door to discover that Eddie has shot himself. Molly and Tom embrace at the top when Molly asks him \\"where did you park?\\".

Summary  This was Sinatra's second attempt at a television series, his first was The Frank Sinatra Show on CBS Television between 1950‚Äì1952. The series was originally slated to consist of thirteen variety episodes, thirteen dramas starring Sinatra, and ten dramas hosted by Sinatra, filmed at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood rather than broadcast live. Sinatra was paid $3 million for the series, and granted near total artistic freedom. The drama segments of the show fared less well against the variety episodes in ratings and the final total was fourteen live variety shows, eight filmed variety shows, four dramas starring Sinatra, and six dramas hosted by Sinatra. Rather than 36 episodes for the season, ABC cut its losses and reduced the total number to 32. Sinatra hated rehearsing, and tried to make eleven shows in fifteen days; the series subsequently received a critical mauling and was Sinatra's last attempt at a television series.

It has been adapted into an anime television series, directed by Tsutomu Mizushima and animated by A-1 Pictures, which premiered in Japan on TBS. It received its international television premiere on Animax's English language networks in Asia, Animax Asia. The manga series won the prestigious Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for best creative work in 2006. In 2007, it won the Kodansha Manga Award for general manga. The manga was on a 1-year hiatus, and it was resumed on the November 2011 issue of Afternoon (magazine). Story The series, set in Saitama, follows the story of Ren Mihashi. Mihashi was the previous ace pitcher in his middle school's baseball team, but it seems that he only got the position because his grandfather was the owner of the school. His teammates (especially the team's catcher, Hatake) hated him, and they always lost their games. Mihashi is thoroughly convinced that he is a lousy baseball pitcher, and feels guilty because he believes that he is responsible for all the losses. Mihashi graduates through middle school with extremely low self-esteem. But in truth Mihashi is really a hardworking and skillful pitcher, and the main reason why his team always lost all the games is because of bad cooperation, because his teammates never talked about the game with him, and they did not try to come up with a plan or strategy to fight against their rivals. Mihashi then transfers to Nishiura High School with plans of quitting baseball because he thinks he is not good enough to succeed at it, though he still loves the game deeply. However, he is dragged into Nishiura's baseball team by their coach, Momoe, while watching the team training outside the field. Assisted by his new teammates (and especially the catcher, Takaya Abe), he grows in stature, confidence and skill, helping his team excel with his own abilities. Characters=Nishiura Baseball Team= Nishiura High School Baseball Team and associated members. Left to right, front row: Izumi, Hanai, Mizutani, Oki, Tajima, Mihashi, Nishihiro, Abe, Suyama, Sakaeguchi, Ai-chan the dog. Left to right, back row: Shiga, Shino'oka, Momoe. ;Ren Mihashi is the primary protagonist and the team's pitcher. His nervousness and extreme lack of self-confidence is at odds with his skill, a result of his passion for and dedication to pitching. Mihashi was ostracized by his middle school teammates, who believed he had been given his position of ace because his grandfather owns the school. During the time period, the catcher and team refused to cooperate during games, causing them to lose every game. Mihashi transfers to Nishiura High School afterward, where he joins their baseball team, though fears he will cause more losses. As the series progresses, Mihashi slowly gains more confidence in himself and trust in the team, especially the catcher, Abe. Despite this, Mihashi retains his skittish and shy personality. He shows to have cynophobia. Mihashi's voice actor is Tsubasa Yonaga, while Sean Michael Teague provides his voice in English. ;Takaya Abe is the catcher in the Nishiura High School baseball team. As such, he forms the team's battery along with Mihashi. Abe is a serious and mature character, whose short temper is often inadvertently provoked by Mihashi. He is very strategically minded and initially values Mihashi for his obedience in team games. Abe is a capable catcher, signaling Mihashi the right pitches after thoroughly examining his opponent. As the catcher, he successfully memorizes the quirks of the batter and what pitches they are weak against. As time progresses, Abe strives to win games to improve Mihashi's self-confidence. He often gets partially jealous toward Mihashi. Abe normally doesn't show his emotions to everyone, including Mihashi and the rest of the team. He has a tendency to nag and yell constantly, but later on he's more and more caring and open to Mihashi's feelings. In some episodes, he smiles. Abe's voice actor is Yuichi Nakamura, while Greg Ayres provides his voice in English. ;Yuuichirou Tajima is the cleanup hitter of the team. He is an outgoing, confident, friendly, and extremely perverted, and very talented at baseball. He is considered to be number 1 in his baseball team. However, because of his small build, he is unable to hit home runs, and relies on the team to complete runs. Tajima and Mihashi develop a friendship, and he is able to understand and elucidate Mihashi's sometimes incomprehensible attempts at communication to others. Many have commented that he acts as Mihashi's older brother. Tajima enjoys catching fast balls and, as a result, becomes a back-up catcher in case of Abe's absence and for training purposes. Tajima's voice actor is Hiro Shimono, while Todd Haberkorn provides his voice in English. ;Azusa Hanai bats fifth for the team who batted cleanup in middle school. While originally presented as a hot-headed and rude character, he is later shown to be a relatively smart and observant person, and is unanimously voted to become team captain. He tries to surpass Tajima and compete with him, but decides that he must work for the good of the team, rather than taking risks to prove himself. Hanai's voice actor is Kish≈ç Taniyama, while Joel McDonald provides his voice in English. ;Yuuto Sakaeguchi usually bats in the second position. Sakaeguchi is very friendly and familiar with Abe from their attendance at the same middle school. When Abe and Mihashi have trouble understanding each other, Sakaeguchi generally attempts to mediate, being able to understand both of their mannerisms. Under stress, Sakaeguchi is known to get diarrhea, a trait revealed by Abe, who noticed it during their high school entrance exams. Sakaeguchi is closest to Suyama on the team, because they are in the same class. Unlike other members of the team, Sakaeguchi's mother is deceased. Sakaeguchi's voice actor is Chihiro Suzuki, while Aaron Dismuke provides his voice in English. ;Kousuke Izumi is one of the more experienced characters on the team, shown to be good at batting, catching, and to be a fast base runner. He is in the same class as Mihashi and Tajima and is revealed to share their lunchtime activities of talking, eating, and then falling asleep. Izumi attended the same elementary and junior high school as Hamada, although up until high school Hamada was a year above him. He appears to enjoy antagonizing Hamada and does not treat him with the respect due to a former senior schoolmate. Due to his more serious personality, Izumi tends to get annoyed quickly, especially at Abe's constant bickering. Izumi's voice actor is Jun Fukuyama, while Chris Burnett provides his voice in English. ;Shoji Suyama acts as the shortstop and third baseman of the team. A level- headed character, he is generally quieter and less rambunctious than his teammates, although he once reacts strongly to Momoe's offer of a particular brand of protein powder to which he harbors a strong dislike. It's revealed that Suyama doesn't share many of the boyish qualities the other Nishiura boys seem to have, such as fantasizing girls, emphasizing his more mature personality. In the series, he is closest to Sakaeguchi. Suyama's voice actor is Makoto Yasumura, while Anthony Bowling provides his voice in English. ;Fumiki Mizutani is less skilled at baseball than some of the other members, and occasionally fumbles catches. This leads to Abe calling him the \\"Crap Left\\". Many of Mizutani's hits at bat are entirely based on luck; he admits that he does not have a good eye for the ball. He appears to be the most simple-minded of the Nishiura team, often sharing the same goofiness as Mihashi. Mizutani appears to enjoy listening to music, as he is almost always seen with headphones on outside of practice. Mizutani's's voice actor is Kenichir≈ç Sumi, while Jean-Luc Hester provides his voice in English. ;Kazutoshi Oki is Nishiura's reserve pitcher and first baseman. He is a very shy and nervous character who rarely speaks his mind because he is afraid that he might be scolded by the others. He has more pitching experience than Hanai, but was reluctant to admit it as he didn't want to pitch in official games. However, he is inspired by Mihashi's dedication and decides to try his best for the team. Oki's voice actor is Y≈´dai Sat≈ç, while Chris Cason provides his voice in English. ;Shintarou Nishihiro is Nishiura's reserve player and is often seen sitting in the benches cheering his team on. Nishihiro is always the base coach next to third base when Nishiura is on the offense. He is a beginner at baseball and therefore has little experience playing. When he does play in games, he often plays the position of left fielder. He is supposedly one of the smartest first years at school because he never has to study for tests. Nishihiro's voice actor is Ry≈çhei Kimura, while Scott Hinze provides his voice in English. =Associated members= ;Maria Momoe is the head coach of the baseball team, and the most prominent adult character in the series. At the start of the series, she mentions that she is a graduate of Nishiura, which used to offer softball instead of baseball. The team nicknames her \\"Momokan\\", short for \\"Momoe-kantoku\\" (Coach Momoe), and develop a respect for her, though often find her intimidating. She is also very attractive described by most of the baseball team. Momoe is physically strong and is very dedicated to the baseball team, working menial side jobs to help pay for equipment. Though several characters comment on the peculiarity of having a female coach for a baseball team, Momoe is shown to be competent in the role. Momoe has a small dog named Ai who accompanies the team to practice, including practice games with other teams. Momoe's voice actress is Risa Hayamizu, while Cynthia Cranz provides her voice in English. ;Chiyo Shino'oka is the manager, a position equivalent to a secretary, of the baseball team. A very hardworking and earnest character, she has great pride in the baseball team and takes great strides in helping them, from making rice balls to writing detailed reports about opposing teams. As manager, she has memorized much information about her own team, and knows all of their full names and birthdays. She statedChapter 17 that she has no romantic interest in anyone on the team, but it is later revealedChapter 59 that she has feelings for Abe, though she won't act upon them to avoid awkwardness in the team. She went to the same middle school as Abe and Sakaeguchi, where she played softball in the position of shortstop. Chiyo also loves trying on other school's uniforms, and often swaps uniforms with her friends and takes pictures. Shino'oka's voice actress is Misato Fukuen, while Cherami Leigh provides her voice in English. ;Tsuyoshi Shiga is the teacher advisor responsible for the baseball team. Though he is a math teacher, Shiga-sensei appears to have a great deal of knowledge about the body and how it works, although he doesn't know much about baseball. His relaxing and concentrating methods of meditation help Mihashi and the others to mentally grow as a team. Shiga's voice actor is Takehiro Murozono, while Chuck Huber provides his voice in English. ;Yoshirou Hamada is a childhood friend of Mihashi. Though they used to play baseball together when they were young, Hamada has quit playing for an unknown reason, supposedly because of ‚ÄúLittle League elbow‚Äù, which refers to an elbow injury caused by pitching too much when he was younger. Hamada founded the baseball team's cheering squad and is very good at sewing. Mihashi calls him by his childhood nickname, Hama- chan, which has been adopted by other members of the baseball team. He attended the same elementary school and junior high as Izumi, and the two appear to be very familiar with each other, though Izumi shows him no respect despite Hamada being a year older. Hamada was held back a year due to missing school because he had to work part-time to earn money. He lives by himself as his family has moved to find jobs elsewhere and has a reputation among the girls in his class, but this seems to be just rumor. Hamada's voice actor is Atsushi Kisaichi, while Christopher Bevins provides his voice in English. ;Umehara and Kajiyama : and are two of Hamada's friends and former classmates who agree to join the baseball teams cheering squad. Umehara is voiced by Takashi Hikita in Japanese, and they are respectively voiced by Eric Vale and J. Michael Tatum in English. =Opposition= ;Teams Several opposing teams are introduced in Big Windup!. Mihoshi Academy's team is a prominent subject, as Mihashi had left them after his three years as ace pitcher. Along with the battery Kanou and Hatake, the team has Hiroyuki Oda, a cleanup hitter who speaks in a Kansai dialect in Japanese, and the American equivalent southern accent in English. Musashino First is the team where Haruna resides as ace pitcher. Originally lazy and laid-back, the team is later stirred into action by Haruna's desire to end the team's mediocrity. Along with Haruna, the team includes Naoto Kaguyama, the starting pitcher, Ohkawa, the team captain, and Kyouhei Akimaru, a kind back-up pitcher for Haruna. Suzune Miyashita is the team's manager who is dating Ohkawa. Tosei High School was the previous year's Koshien winner, who underestimated the skill of Nishiura. Junta Takase is the Tosei's ace pitcher, who uses sinkers and forkballs to strike out batters, while Kazuki Kawai is the team captain. ;Shuugo Kanou was Mihashi's former teammate who took the role of starting pitcher after Mihashi left and uses a forkball as a strikeout pitch. His team had said that he would have been the ace pitcher of the team if Mihashi's grandfather, who owned the school, had not made Mihashi the starting pitcher. However, Kanou refuses to accept the notion, seeing Mihashi's true potential as an ace pitcher and angry at how the team treated him. As such, he is the first of his team to play seriously against Nishiura in a practice game until convincing the others to as well. Kanou and Mihashi were friends during childhood and Mihashi occasionally refers to him by the nickname \\"Shu-chan\\". In fact, at the last episode of season one, Kanou smiles upon hearing this and says excitedly, \\"He's calling me by my first name! It's like we're little kids again!\\". Kanou's voice actor is Jun Oosuka, while Jamie McGonnigal provides his voice in English. ;Atsushi Hatake is the catcher for the Mihoshi team. He was the most opposed to Mihashi being their ace pitcher in middle school, believing that Kanou was a better pitcher and deserved the position more. Hatake goes as far as to threaten to break Mihashi's arm, even after he had left and joined Nishiura, but is later convinced by Kanou to take him seriously. Hatake and the rest of the team makes amends after losing to Mihashi and his teammates, though Hatake still stubbornly declares Kanou the better pitcher. Hatake's voice actor is Shintarou Oohata, while Josh Grelle provides his voice in English. ;Motoki Haruna is Musashino's back-up pitcher and a former teammate of Abe, whose goal is to become a professional baseball player. At first, he refused Abe to be his catcher because of Abe's short height and doubted his ability as a catcher. Though they grow closer, Abe begins to dislike Haruna's principles about pitching; he refuses to throw more than 80 pitches and use his full strength, while also being protective of his throwing arm, and was unwilling to throw a slider due to a mosquito bite. Haruna's current catcher, Akimaru, noted that Haruna seemed more aggravated and wild in his middle school years, and expressed an understanding for Abe's feelings. On the Musashino team, Haruna is shown to be very hard-working and instills determination into the team, particularly Naoto Kaguyama, who would have quit without Haruna's interference. Haruna's voice actor is Masaya Matsukaze, while Kevin M. Connolly provides his voice in English. =Other characters= ;Ruri Mihashi is the cousin of Ren Mihashi. When they were young, Mihashi and his family visited Ruri and they often played together with Kanou, leading him and Mihashi to develop a friendship. During his middle school games, he told Ruri to not attend and thus did not tell her when the games took place, embarrassed and ashamed for his failures. She cheered for Nishiura during their game against Tosei, surprised by how Mihashi had skillfully played during the game. Ruri enjoys calling Mihashi by the nickname Renren, much to his dismay. Mihashi's teammates even teased him upon hearing Ruri call him by that nickname. She has a younger brother named Ryuu. Ruri's voice actress is Marina Inoue, while Monica Rial provides her voice in English. Development While growing up in Saitama, Asa Higuchi became familiar with baseball by reading the manga Dokaben. When she was in high school, the story of a local baseball team wound up inspiring her to come up with the idea for her own baseball manga. In the original version, Mihashi never spoke and characters like Momoe, Kanou and Haruna did not exist yet. Following that, she collected data on high school baseball for over 10 years in order to create the manga, and she worked with the school she had attended, Urawanishi High School, in the year prior to the serialization. In fact, Urawanishi seems to have been the design for the school that the Nishiura boys attend. The two names are similar as well. Five months prior to the serialization of ≈åkiku Furikabutte in Afternoon, Higuchi published a one shot in the magazine titled \\"The Basic of Basics\\". The story was centered around the characters of the Musashino Dai Ichi school, who would show up in the series itself. Media=Manga= Currently has 32 volumes. =Anime= A TV anime series adapting 15 volumes of the manga was produced by Aniplex, TBS Television, Kodansha, Movic, Mainichi Broadcasting System, and A-1 Pictures. It was directed by Tsutomu Mizushima, with Y≈çsuke Kuroda handling series composition, Takahiko Yoshida designing the characters and Shir≈ç Hamaguchi composing the music. The anime premiered in Japan on TBS from April 2007 and also aired on the Japanese Animax, as well as in English across Animax's English language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia. A second season was announced in the 13th volume of the manga. The first episode aired on April 2, 2010.

This temple, built by Rajaraja Chola II in the 12th century CE is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the Brihadeeswara Temple at Thanjavur, the Gangaikondacholisvaram Temple at Gangaikonda Cholapuram that are referred to as the Great Living Chola Temples. The Airavatesvarar temple is one among a cluster of eighteen medieval era large Hindu temples in the Kumbakonam area, Thanjavur District.Ayyar 1992, pp. 349-350 The temple is dedicated to Shiva. It also reverentially displays Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism, along with the legends associated with Nayanmars ‚Äì the Bhakti movement saints of Shaivism. The stone temple incorporates a chariot structure, and includes major Vedic and Puranic deities such as Indra, Agni, Varuna, Vayu, Brahma, Surya, Vishnu, Saptamtrikas, Durga, Saraswati, Sri devi (Lakshmi), Ganga, Yamuna, Subrahmanya, Ganesha, Kama, Rati and others. Shiva's consort has a dedicated shrine called the Periya Nayaki Amman temple. This is a detached temple situated to the north of the Airavateshvarar temple. This might have been a part of the main temple when the outer courts were complete. At present, parts of the temple such as the gopuram is in ruins, and the main temple and associated shrines stand alone. It has two sun dials namely morning and evening sun dials which can be seen as wheels of the chariot. The temple continues to attract large gatherings of Hindu pilgrims every year during Magha, while some of the images such as those of Durga and Shiva are part of special pujas. Location The Airavatesvara Temple is located in Darasuram, about southwest of Kumbakonam, southwest of Chennai and from Chidambaram. It is about to the northeast to the Brihadeeswara Temple in Thanjavur, and about to the southwest of Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple. All three are a part of the UNESCO world heritage site.Great Living Chola Temples, Archaeological Survey of India, Government of India Pyramid-structure inside Airavatesvara Temple The nearest airport with regular services is Tiruchirappalli International Airport (IATA: TRZ), about away. The temple is on highway 22 connecting Tiruchirappalli, and highway 36 connecting it to Thanjavur. The nearby cities of Tiruchirapalli and Chidambaram are connected daily to other major cities by the network of Indian Railways and Tamil Nadu bus services. The temple though inland, is near the Kollidam River, within the Kaveri (Cauvery) delta with access to the Bay of Bengal and through it to the Indian Ocean. Nomenclature The Airavatesvara Shiva temple has a water tank. This tank has a connected channel that brings in Cauveri River water where Hindus gather annually to take a dip. The local mythology narrates how Airavata, or Indra's (malla) white elephant was restored with clean, white skin after he took a dip in this tank. This legend is carved in stone in the inner shrine, and this Indra's elephant gives this temple its name.Ayyar 1992, pp. 350-351 Description Chariot detail, Airavatesvara temple, Tamil Nadu. The Cholas built hundreds of Hindu temples across their empire. Of these four were vast complexes with all stone vimanas. The Airavatesvara temple is one of these four. The other three are the temples found in Thanjavur built by Rajaraja I, in Gangaikonda Cholapuram built by Rajendra I, and in Tribuvanam by the later era Chola king Kulottunga II. The Airavatesvara temple is another square plan structure completed in 1166 CE. The surviving inner courtyard is almost six stacked squares of side, measuring a total of about by . The Nandi mandapa and the stambha are found outside of this main temple courtyard and they are aligned with the main temple's east-west axis. It is classified as Karakkoil, a temple fashioned after temple chariots which are taken in procession around the temple during festivals. The temple sanctum is a square, have thick walls on which the vimana superstructure rises to a height of . The circumambulatory path is not provided immediately around the sanctum, as is found in the Thanjuvur big temple and the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple. Rather, this path is outside in the courtyard. The sanctum garbha griya is connected to the mukha-mandapa through the ardha-mandapa supported on pillars and flanked by two massive dvarapalas. The maha-mandapa is a rectangle of about by , with six rows of right pillars (forty-eight total). These have reliefs and intricate carvings. Towards the east of the maha-mandapa is the agra-mandapa also called the Rajagambhiran-tiru-mandapam after the king. This hall is shaped like a chariot, provided with stone horses and wheels. The design is similar to the Nritta-sabha (community dance hall) of the Chidambaram temple and the Konark Sun Temple near Puri, Odisha.Chaitanya 1987, p. 42 =Singing steps= The agra mandapa has an attached square porch of side. It has ornately carved steps that go from east to west. On its east, outside the main podium, is the bali-pitham. It is unusual, in that it is produced as intricately carved balustraded steps. When one walks or steps on them, they produce a musical note. They are therefore called the \\"singing steps\\".Ayyar 1993, p. 351 =Sculpture= This temple is a storehouse of art and architecture and has some exquisite stone carvings. Although this temple is much smaller than the Brihadeesvara Temple or the Gangaikondacholapuram Temple, it is more exquisite in detail. The elevation and proportions of all the units is elegant with sculptures dominating the architecture. The pedestal of the Balipitha adjoins a small shrine which contains an image of Ganesha. The reliefs all along the base of the main temple narrate the stories of the sixty three Shaiva Bhakti saints called Nayanars. These stories are found in the Periya Purana by Sekkilar. Periya Nayaki, a smaller shrine On the outer walls of the main sanctum are sculpture niches, five on each side, with the middle one larger than others. They show various Hindu deities, with the middle one of each side showing Shiva in different aspects. =Other shrines= In the south-west corner of the court is a mandapam having 4 shrines. One of these has an image of Yama. Adjoining this shrine are large stone slabs sculptured with images of the sapthamathas (seven celestial nymphs). The construction of a separate temple for Devi, slightly later than the main temple, indicates the emergence of the Amman shrine as an essential component of the South Indian temple complex. =Inscriptions= Inscription in Airavatesvara Temple There are various inscriptions in the temple. One of these records the renovation of the shrines by Kulottunga Chola III.Ayyar 1993, p. 353 The north wall of the verandah consists of 108 sections of inscriptions, each containing the name and description and image of the 63 Saivacharya (Saivite saints) listing the principal events in their life.Chaitanya 1997, p. 40Vasudevan, p. 55 This reflects the deep roots of Saivism in this region. Other important sculptures of the temple are the 108 Devara Othuvars who sung in the temple during the time of Raja Raja II. There are sculptures for river goddesses like Cauvery, Ganges, Yamuna, Godavari and Narmada. Another inscription close to the gopura, records that an image was brought from Kalyani, then known as Kalyanapura by emperor Rajadhiraja Chola I after his defeat of the Western Chalukya king Someshwara I, his sons Vikramaditya VI and Someshwara II his capture of the Chalukyan capital.Davis 1997, p. 51 The inscriptions are also important in identifying the sculptures that once were a part of various ruined monuments. For example, the eastern gopurum has niches with inscriptions that label the sculpture therein. Most of these sculptures are now broken or missing. The inscriptions indicate that it had the following sculptures: *Northern face: Adi Chandesvara, Gangadevi, Tumburu Nardar, Vaisravana, Chandra, Maha Sata, Nagaraja, Vayu *West: Devi, Rudrani, Vaishnavi, Brahmi, Varunani, Nandidevar, Periyadevar, Santyatita Sakti, Santa devi, Vidya Sakti, Pratishta Sakti, Nivarti Sakti *Southern face: Daksha Prajapati, Yamuna devi, Rati, Kamadeva *East: Agni deva, Agastya, Sri devi, Durga devi, Devendran, Padma Nidhi, Surya, Subrahmanya, Kshetrapala, Sarasvati, Visvakarma, Isana History The temple was built by king Rajaraja Chola II. He ruled the Chola Empire between 1146 and 1172 CE. The established capital for his predecessors was Gangapuri, also referred in some inscriptions as Gangaikonda Cholapuram, named after the holy north Indian Ganges River and goddess. Rajaraja II, however, spent most of his time in the secondary capital city of Ayirattali, also called Palaiyarai and Rajarajapuri. This urban complex included Darasuram, the site of Airavatesvara Temple. He was a patron of Tamil literature and sponsored new Hindu temples in the empire, instead of enhancements and expansions supported by his father and grandfather. The temple at Ayirattali, which came to be known as Airavatesvarar temple in inscriptions is one of his legacy. The Airavatesvara temple was much larger than it is now. It had sapta veedhis (seven streets) and seven courts, similar to the Srirangam temple, according to the inscriptions. All are gone, except the one court with the main temple that survives.Ayyar 1992, pp. 350-351 There are ruins of gopuram and some structures at some distance from the current visitor premises confirming that the site was badly damaged at some point like the other major Chola era temples and various Chola cities including the capital Gangaikonda Cholapuram.Ayyar 1992, pp. 350-351 Bull and Elephant relief at Thanjavur Airavatesvara Temple. The reasons for this destruction are unclear. According to Vasanthi, the Pandyas who defeated the Cholas during the later part of 13th century \\"may have raged the city [Gangaikonda Cholapuram] to ground\\" to avenge their previous defeats. However, it is unclear why other temples were destroyed and this temple was spared, as well as why there are around 20 inscriptions from later Cholas, Pandyas and Vijayanagar Empire indicating various gifts and grants to this temple. An alternate theory links the destruction to the raids, plunder and wars, particularly with the invasion of the capital city and the territories that were earlier a part by the Chola Empire along with Madurai by the armies of Delhi Sultanate led by the Muslim commander Malik Kafur in 1311, followed by Khusrau Khan in 1314 and Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1327. The period that followed saw wars between the Hindu kings and the Muslim Sultans who seceded the Delhi Sultanate and carved out new polity such as the nearby Madurai Sultanate (1335‚Äì1378). The Vijayanagara Empire defeated the Madurai Sultanate in 1378 and this temple along with other Chola era temples thereafter came under Hindu kings again who repaired and restored many of them. World Heritage Site Airavatesvara Temple was added to UNESCO's World Heritage Site list of Great Living Chola Temples in the year 2004. The Great Living Chola Temples includes the Brihadeeswara Temple at Thanjavur, the Temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram at Gangaikonda Cholapuram and the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram. All of these temples were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries CE and have a lot of similarities.Ayyar 1993, p. 316 In popular culture The American astronomer Carl Sagan visited the Airavatesvara Temple for his 1980 television documentary series, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. In the tenth episode titled The Edge of Forever, Sagan talks about the Hindu religion and the Vedas, and narrates the legend of the god Shiva being considered a cosmic deity while displaying ancient Indian art.The Great Chola Temples.

The animation's story of a kiwi that aspires to fly created a major Internet phenomenon after it was hosted on the video sharing site YouTube. Unofficial versions of the video pair it with Mad World by Gary Jules. These versions became popular viral videos. Plot The video itself centers around a kiwi bird who is mysteriously seen to be nailing an array of trees to the side of a sheer cliff so that they stick out horizontally. After the kiwi finishes it returns to the top of the cliff, before donning an aviator's cap and suddenly jumping off. As it dives down the cliff head-first the camera view turns sideways, revealing the purpose behind the kiwi's efforts. A tear wells from one eye as the kiwi achieves its dream, flapping its tiny wings as it \\"flies\\" above the forest of trees. The kiwi then disappears into the fog below, and a distant thud is heard. Reception Kiwi! has received a large following for its deep meaning and heart touching manner.

History The Brafferton was constructed in 1723, likely by Henry Cary, Jr., to house the College's Indian school, which was endowed by funds from an estate purchased by the charity of Robert Boyle, the noted English scientist. Income from Brafferton Manor in Yorkshire, England, designated for charitable and pious purposes, was used to \\"civilize\\" Indian youth, prepare them for Anglican priesthood ‚Äî and produce interpreters and cultural liaisons who could aid Britain's colonial expansion. The undertaking of producing Indian ministers met with little success, except among the Pamunkey. Virginia's efforts to encourage allied and neighboring tribes to send Indian youth to Williamsburg were more successful, and several Brafferton students were key players in the late eighteenth century wars of North America. However, during the American Revolution, income from the Boyle estate was interrupted, and the teenage students mostly engaged in the conflict, the last leaving during the fall of 1778. Boyle monies were reinvested in the College following the Revolution, but discontinued after 1784, partially as a result of a lengthy court case involving the trustees of the Boyle Charity and the College of William & Mary. After the College lost the chancery case, the Indian school was abandoned, and the Boyle money was redirecting to the Caribbean, and still later, to Canada. The Brafferton was damaged during the American Civil War and the College spent $3,000 for repairs. Throughout the years, the building served as a residence for professors, a dormitory for students, an armory for the Wise Light Infantry, and an alumni office. Additionally, it has temporarily housed other offices, fine arts classes, and even the Music Department for a short period of time. Since 1985, the Brafferton has housed the offices of the president and the provost of the College. At the request of the Governor's advisory Council on Indians, a state historical marker was erected on the Brafferton grounds in 2005. The building was first refurbished in 1930-31 during the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg. It received additional renovation in 2010‚Äì13, a period in which the College of William & Mary established the Brafferton Legacy Group in conjunction with alumni from the school's tribal descendant communities, the Department of Anthropology, the College's American Indian Resource Center, Colonial Williamsburg's (CW) Department of Archaeology, and CW's American Indian Initiative. The College and CW hosted a ground blessing for the start of archaeological investigations at the Indian school, and several Pamunkey tribal members worked on the 2011-12 excavations. The building was rededicated in 2013 with opening remarks in the Cherokee language and honor songs, alongside greetings from the President of William & Mary and College Provost.

Kayavarohan is popularly known as Karvan and is situated on the National Highway 8 at a distance of 30 km from Vadodara. Kayavarohan is considered as the birthplace of Lakulisha, the 2nd Century C.E. Shaivite revivalist, reformer and propounder of the pashupata doctrine. It is an important religious place on account of its Lakulisha temple.http://www.ktss.in  History  Kayavarohan (Karvan) is an ancient town believed to have existed through each of the Four Ages. As per Shaivite mythology, Lord Shiva in the Lakulish manifestation appeared at this place. According to mythology and puranas, from here Lord Shiva transmigrated into the form of a Brahmin child. Thus the place came to be known as Kayavarohan [Kaya (Body) + Avarohan (Descent) = Where the body of the Lord has descended]. It is an ancient town believed to have existed through each of the Four Ages according to the Hindus. According to a popularly held belief, it was from here that Lord Shiva in the guise of a child transmigrated after death and his body disappeared. Thus the place came to be known as Kayavarohan. A number of copper coins and a stone quern have been found from here. A beautiful head of Tapas, the image of Kartikeya and an idol of Uma Maheshwara are some of the archaeological specimen discovered from here that are preserved locally in a museum. Religious Significance The Kayavarohan temple Kayavarohan is one of the sixty-eight ‚Äòteerthas' (Pilgrimage) of Lord Shiva as mentioned in the Shiva Purana. However, Kayavarohan is not among the 12 Jyotirlingas as mentioned in the Shiva Purana. It is of great significance to the Pasupatas (Followers of the Pashupati), those in the spiritual following of Lakulish, for it is considered to be the place of Shiva's appearance on earth in that incarnation. Lakulish is considered to be the 28th birth of Shiva. Shiva had come to the earth in the form of Lakulisha through Kayavarohan, literally meaning ‚ÄòDescent of the form‚Äô. Kayavarohan harbours the Brahmeshwar Jyotirshivlang temple, claimed to have been founded by Maharshi Vishwamitra. It has been held that the incarnation of Shiva in Lakulish has merged with the linga in Shambavi Mudra. The Kayavarohan lingam represents the \\"formless\\" but a unique, exceptional iconic form of Shiva bearing the image of a meditating yogi, who holds parchments in one hand and citron (Matulinga) in the other. It is believed the main place of pilgrimage was Ichhapuri in Satya Yuga, Mayapuri in Treta Yuga, Meghavati in Dvapara Yuga, and Kayavarohan in the present Kali Yuga. This temple has a Lingam of Lord Shiva, made up of black stone. It is believed that Maharshi Vishwamitra had installed this Linga of Lord Shiva during the Ramayana period. In the Vedic times, Kayavarohan/Karvan was a popular centre of learning and education and used to house numerous Vedic Universities, Yajna Shalas and the temples of many Hindu Gods. The myth has it that during the barbarian invasion of Mahmood of Ghazni, the luminous jyotirlinga with Lakulish merged the light of all of the other 12 jyotirlingas into its form and disappeared. Presently, there is an underground meditation cave at the Kayavarohana temple used for seclusion and meditation. There is a Swaminarayan Hindu temple built by Haricharandas Swami in Vikram Samvat 1971 which falls under the Vadtal Gadi. It is located by Kayavarohan Tower near Gam panchayat. Maha Shivratri is most famous festival in Kayavarohan. During the sacred day, hundreds of men wear Lord Mahadev's attire and appear at the temples. Archaeological Significance Ancient site (Excavated) at Kayavarohan The village and its surrounding areas are of great archaeological significance. Ancient sculptures and relics belonging to the 2nd century have been excavated from this place. Later during the Dark Ages of Hinduism (Muslim invasions and subsequent reign from 11th century CE. to 17th century CE), starting with the attacks of barbarian Muslim marauder Mahmud Ghazni, who looted and destroyed the temple of Somnath in Gujarat, all the Shiva temples at Karvan were desecrated and razed by the iconoclast Muslim invaders. However, the Shiva Lingas of the destroyed temples still survive and remain at the site, without temples around them. The temple of Lakulish and temples of Karvan were rebuilt and restored during the late twentieth century by the Hindu spiritual leader Kripalvanand. Numerous Hindu icons, number of copper coins and a stone quern have been found from Kayavarohan. A grand head of Tapasvi, the image of Kartikeya and an idol of Uma Maheshwara are some of the rare and unmatched archaeological specimen discovered from Kayavarohan. Kayavarohan is a place of great archaeological importance and the A.S.I. Archaeological Survey of India has listed Karvan as a heritage site and has set up a special museum for the remains found around this site. Karvan is one of the major sites of Indian Heritage.

The organisation has come under criticism for its encouragement and support of Neo-Nazis. The organization has garnered a reputation for being shrouded in secrecy and thus remains a source of speculation. History Operating covertly since 1946, the organization that later became publicly active as \\"Stille Hilfe\\", aided the escape of hunted Nazi fugitives, particularly to South America. Thus Adolf Eichmann, Johann von Leers, Walter Rauff and Josef Mengele could escape to Argentina. Establishment After the main exponents of the later association had already long formed an active network, it was decided a non-profit association should be formed primarily to facilitate a donations campaign. On 7 October 1951 the founders' meeting was held in Munich and on 15 November 1951 the organization was entered in the register of associations in the Upper Bavarian city Wolfratshausen. The first president, Helene Elizabeth, Princess von Isenburg was chosen because of her good contacts in the aristocracy and conservative upper middle-class circles as well as the Catholic Church. Founding members of the committee included church representatives Theophil Worm and Johannes Neuh√§usler, as well as high-ranking former functionaries of the Nazi state such as the former SS-Standartenf√ºhrer and head of department in the Central Reich Security Office (RSHA), Wilhelm Spengler, and SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Heinrich Malz, who was the personal adviser of Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Objectives and activity in the mid-1950s Helene Elisabeth, Princess von Isenburg explained its objectives in this way: \\"From the start of its efforts‚Äö the Stille Hilfe sought to take care of, above all, the serious needs of the prisoners of war and those interned completely without rights. Later their welfare service was active for those accused and arrested as a result of the war trials, whether in the prisons of the victors or in German penal institutions\\". From the beginning of the Nuremberg Trials, the group sought to influence public opinion to prevent the death penalty. In press campaigns, personal and open letters and petitions, the accused were usually represented as innocent victims‚Äìmerely those taking commands, irreproachable and having a blind faith in the F√ºhrer‚Äìwho would have to suffer bitter injustice by victor's justice. Because Princess von Isenburg was particularly devoted to the accused who were condemned to death in Landsberg prison, she was affectionately known as \\"Mother of the Landsbergers\\" in order to let \\"Stille Hilfe\\" be seen primarily as a charitable organisation. The legal assistance for arrested war criminals was first organised by the attorney Rudolf Aschenauer (1913‚Äì1983), who also formulated and submitted requests for grace and revisions. The organisation paid vacation, dismissal and Christmas benefits to the prisoners and also supported their families. They were not only limited to humanitarian activities but also pursued ideological and revisionist objectives. Princess Isenburg, a strict Catholic, tirelessly pleaded the criminals' cause in conservative circles and with high-ranking church representatives (even up to the Pope). Johannes Neuh√§usler (1888‚Äì1973) in particular, who not only had suffered detention/imprisonment by the Gestapo, but also had been held by the Nazis in the Dachau concentration camp as a special prisoner, was most effective in public opinion, even among western Allied officials. The motives of the bishops lay probably less in a conscious ideological identification with the war criminals, but rather in the effort regarding reconciliation with the German past and the start of the new post-war society in West Germany. Neuh√§usler explained that he wanted to repay \\"the bad with good\\". The further connections of Princess Isenburg and Aschenauer led particularly to former SS organisations such as Gauleiterkreis under Werner Naumann, which was already partly formed in Allied prisoner-of- war camps. Princess Isenburg initiated a whole series of organisations as \\"The working group for the rescue of the Landsberger prisoners\\", who were essentially financed by the churches. Activities since the 1950s The churches to a large extent withdrew support with the end of the main Nuremberg Trials and the release of the time-serving Nazi war criminals from Landsberg prison in 1958. In the following decades Stille Hilfe worked somewhat in secret with revisionist organizations and prominent protagonists of the \\"Auschwitzl√ºge\\" (Auschwitz lie) like Thies Christophersen and Manfred Roeder and co-operated with relevant foreign organizations and personalities e.g. (Florentine Rost van Tonningen, L√©on Degrelle). By a not insignificant number of inheritances and by regular donations, the organization controls considerable funds. Since Stille Hilfe does not publish end-of-year figures, one can only estimate the influx of capital; however, perhaps donations (not including inheritances) were annually circa ‚Ç¨60,000 to ‚Ç¨80,000, at least to the end of the 1990s. Stille Hilfe supported the condemned in the D√ºsseldorfer Majdanek trials, the former concentration camp guard Hildegard L√§chert (\\"bloody Brygida\\") and later Klaus Barbie, Erich Priebke and Josef Schwammberger, who from 1942 to 1944 was commander of German labour camps in occupied Poland, involved in the massacres of Przemy≈õl and Rozwad√≥w. Whether they were involved in the release of Herbert Kappler from a prison in Rome in 1977 is not clarified. Chairmen after Princess Isenburg (until 1959) were to 1992 the former Bund Deutscher M√§del leaders Gertrude Herr and Adelheid Klug. They have been led since 1992 by Horst Janzen. The organisation today has approximately 40 members with decreasing numbers. At the same time however contacts were reinforced with \\"Hilfsorganisation f√ºr nationale politische Gefangene und deren Angeh√∂rige\\" (relief organization for national political prisoners) (HNG), so continuity may be secured. Based until 1976 in Bremen Osterholz, since 1989 in Rotenburg an der W√ºmme, since 1992 in Wuppertal. In 1993‚Äì94 it caused a political debate in the Bundestag over its non-profit status as a revisionistic right-wing extremist association and was submitted to an examination by the fiscal authorities. In the Bundesfinanzhof (Federal Finance Court) it was decided in November 1999 to deny Stille Hilfe charitable status. Leading member Gudrun Burwitz (right), daughter of top Nazi official Heinrich Himmler, with her mother at the International Military Tribunal trial of war criminals at Nuremberg, 1945 For years they had a prominent symbol: Gudrun Burwitz, the daughter of Heinrich Himmler. Known to her father as \\"P√ºppi\\", she was an idol to Stille Hilfe and their affiliates. At meetings such as Ulrichsbergtreffen in Austria she appeared at the same time as a star and an authority. Burwitz campaigned intensively in the last few years for accused Nazis. This particularly showed up in the case of Anton Malloth, who had lived undisturbed for about 40 years in Meran. He was proven guilty for his acts as a supervisor in the Gestapo-prison \\"Kleine Festung Theresienstadt\\", which was part of the larger Theresienstadt concentration camp.The sins of my father The Independent. 1 February 1999 In 2001 Malloth was convicted by the district court of Munich for murder and attempted murder and sentenced to life imprisonment after the public prosecutor's office in Munich had taken over the procedure of the public prosecutor's office in Dortmund, which for many years had hijacked the procedure. From 1988 to 2000, Malloth lived in Pullach near Munich. Gudrun Burwitz was instructed by Stille Hilfe to rent a comfortable room for him in a home for the aged, which was built on a lot formerly owned by Rudolf Hess. In common with the secretive nature of the organisation, Burwitz did not give press interviews. At the end of the 1990s it became public that the social welfare assistance administration (and thus the German taxpayers) had in large part taken over the considerable running costs of the home where Malloth was staying. This, along with the participation of Gudrun Burwitz, resulted in substantial public criticism. Although firmly rooted in the neo-Nazi fringe, it developed amicable relations with conservative West German politicians, such as CDU Bundestag Parliamentary leader Alfred Dregger, who praised the efforts of Stille Hilfe in 1989. In 1991, a Stille Hilfe representative attended the graveside ceremony in Kassel of Michael K√ºhnen, the prominent Neo-Nazi leader who died of HIV-related complications. Stille Hilfe laid a wreath that bore the SS motto \\"Michael K√ºhnen ‚Äì his honour is loyalty.\\" The organisation has come under criticism for its encouragement and support of neo-Nazis. This has included legal aid for those facing prosecution. It also supports a Protestant old people's home in Pullach, near Munich.

Sorensen, intended to help re-invigorate lawyers' commitment to providing pro bono legal services. *a Commission on Civic Education and the Separation of Powers, co- chaired by US Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor and former US Senator Bill Bradley, sought to educate Americans about constitutional democracy. *the ABA Task Force on Access to Civil Justice, chaired by Maine Supreme Judicial Court Associate Justice Howard Dana, Jr., to consider providing legal services to millions of poor Americans. *the ABA Task Force on Hurricane Katrina to help provide free legal services to victims of Katrina and other hurricanes that devastated the Gulf States in the fall of 2005. In total, Greco created two commissions, five task forces, and several other special committees. He appointed the ABA Executive Director Search Committee which conducted a year-long national search for the Association's new Executive Director, Henry F. White, Jr., who took office on September 1, 2006. In addition to serving as its President, Mr. Greco has long been active in the American Bar Association, including serving on the Board of Governors, in the House of Delegates for more than twenty years, and as the elected ABA State Delegate from Massachusetts during 1993-2004. He chaired the Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, the Section of Individual Rights & Responsibilities, the Executive Committee of the Conference of State Delegates, the Steering Committee of the Nominating Committee, the ABA Day in Washington Planning Committee, and other committees. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, he served on the ABA Task Force on Terrorism and the Law, and helped develop policies relating to the imperative of balancing national security and constitutional freedoms so that both are protected. Mr. Greco is a member of the American Law Institute. Massachusetts/New England professional activities Mr. Greco served as president of the Massachusetts Bar Association, the New England Bar Association, the New England Bar Foundation and the Board of Trustees of Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education. As MBA president, among other initiatives, he and Governor Michael S. Dukakis appointed a blue-ribbon Commission on the Unmet Legal Needs of Children, whose report and recommendations led to enactment of new statutes protecting the legal rights of children. By appointment of the Justices of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court he chaired the Court's Special Committee on Pro Bono Legal Services in the late 1990s. He served for eight years on Gov. William Weld's Massachusetts Judicial Nominating Council, and in 1993-94 served on Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Senator John F.

He is a member of the Board of Directors of the New England (Business) Council, and during 1998-2004 served as Chair of the ground breaking Creative Economy Initiative, a regional economic/cultural development effort designed to attract investment in New England‚Äôs Creative Economy. Criticism of President George W. Bush for signing statements In the spring of 2006, President Greco created a blue ribbon task force in order to address the issue that President Bush, instead of vetoing bills passed by Congress that he finds objectionable, signs the bill, but attaches statements that indicates intentions not to follow certain provisions. Greco and the ABA responded to this by saying that the president's signing statements revoke Congress's constitutional authority to check and balance the executive power. This is highly significant because all American presidents in office before President Bush have issued a combined total of 600 signing statements. Bush, however, has issued 800 signing statements over a 5¬Ω year period during his term. Previous presidents, such as George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, have issued signing statements as well; however, these presidents only expressed disapproval of certain provisions in a bill, but did not assert the right to ignore them. The report released by the task force declared, \\"The Constitution is not what the President says it is.\\" The task force that Greco created was bipartisan. The participants included William Sessions, Mickey Edwards, and Bruce Fein. Personal life and education Michael Greco spent his youth in Hinsdale, Illinois, and has resided in Wellesley, Massachusetts, for the past forty years. He obtained his Juris Doctor from Boston College Law School in 1972. Here he served as editor in chief of the Boston College Law Review and as class president. He also clerked for Judge Leonard P. Moore on the United States court of appeals for the Second Circuit. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in English at Princeton University in 1965.

The two substituents are in a meta position with respect to each other, giving the alternative name of m-nitrobenzoic acid. This compound can be useful as it is a precursor to 3-aminobenzoic acid, which is used to prepare some dyes.. Preparation It is prepared by nitration of benzoic acid at low temperatures. Both 2-Nitrobenzoic acid and 4-Nitrobenzoic acid are produced as side products, with yields of approximately 20% and 1.5% respectively. Since carboxylic acid functional groups are electron withdrawing, during an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of nitration, substituents are directed to a meta position which explains this regiochemistry. A less efficient route involves nitration of methyl benzoate, followed by hydrolysis.Oliver Kamm and J. B. Segur \\"m-Nitrobenzoic Acid\\" Org. Synth. 1923, volume 3, 73. Alternatively, oxidative C-C bond cleavage of 3-nitroacetophenone to the corresponding aryl carboxylic acid, has been demonstrated. A further synthesis involves the oxidation of 3-nitrobenzaldehyde. Properties With a pKa of 3.47, 3-nitrobenzoic acid is about ten times more acidic than benzoic acid. The conjugate base of benzoic acid is stabilised by the presence of the electron withdrawing nitro group which explains its increased acidity in comparison to unsubstituted benzoic acid. It is typically soluble in oxygenated and chlorinated solvents.  Reactivity  The presence of both carboxylic acid and nitro functional groups deactivate the ring with respect to electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Safety The compound is likely of modest toxicity, with (i.v., mouse) of 640 mg/kg. This compound can cause skin and eye irritation with symptoms of exposure including methemoglobin, sensitisation, irritation, and corneal damage.

His preaching encouraged the Fourth Crusade. He is a beatus of the Roman Catholic Church; his feast is celebrated on March 2. A priest at Neuilly from 1191, he attended the lectures of Peter the Chanter in Paris. He began to preach from 1195, and gained a reputation for piety and eloquence. His preaching focused on reforming people's morality and many of his denunciations were upon the sins of usury and lustfulness. Clerical concubinage was a common target of his and he would often point out priests and concubines that were guilty of this sin in the crowd when he was preaching. It was reported that he rebuked King Richard I of England by advising him to marry off his three evil daughters, his Pride, Greed, and Lechery; and that the king replied that he would marry them appropriately to the Templars, the Cistercians, and to the bishops and abbots of the Church.Hoveden, Chronica, Volume 4., p. 76.

An invitation for Fulk to preach a crusade came from Pope Innocent III in 1199. His preaching influenced both Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, and Alix de Montmorency. Fulk's assiduous enthusiasm in carrying out his mission led to rumours concerning the usage made of the monetary sums it produced. He died shortly afterwards. Bibliography * C.

He was the guide and climbing leader of the first complete ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) in 1913, with expedition members Hudson Stuck, Episcopal Archdeacon of the Yukon and Arctic; Walter Harper and Robert Tatum. John Fredson was one of two young Gwich'in Alaska Natives who supported the party. Early life Harry Karstens was born in Chicago, Illinois on September 2, 1878. His parents were Emma Terveen and John Jacob Karstens, an immigrant from the Duchy of Holstein. His father owned a feed store and livery. Harry was the fifth born of seven children in his family. Career Like many young men, Karstens went North for adventure to Dawson City, Canada during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897; he was nineteen. There, he mined on Seventymile Creek and helped lay out the town of Eagle, Alaska. He also carried freight and mail with Charles McGonagall via dog teams among the frontier towns of Fairbanks, Valdez and Kantishna, being paid $75 per month. He gained his nickname as the \\"Seventymile Kid\\" after working for the post office. Miners and packers climb 1500 ice steps at Chilkoot Pass, September 1898 He also worked as a packer, hauling miners' supplies over the Chilkoot Pass on his back, usually in 50-pound packs. In winter, the ice leading to the summit was cut into 1500 steps, which travelers climbed in single file. Authorities required each \\"stampeder\\" (the persons intending to stay and mine) to bring in two tons of supplies to provide for himself for a year in the camps. Karstens ran dog teams on the frontier, as well as riverboats when the rivers were navigable. Drawing on his skills developed on the frontier, from 1906 to 1908, Karstens accompanied Charles Sheldon, a hunter, conservationist, and naturalist, on hunting trips into the Toklat River region. Sheldon, the chairman of the influential Boone and Crockett Club, successfully campaigned with Congress to have the area set aside as a national park. In 1917, Denali National Park was established as Mount McKinley National Park. =Denali expedition= On March 27, 1912, Hudson Stuck, Episcopal Archdeacon of the Yukon, sent Karstens a letter inviting him to join an expedition to climb Denali. Stuck emphasized the financial value of the trip, saying, \\"if we succeed in the ascent, the expedition will not be without the likelihood of financial value, and that there will be return to you for the time and labour.\\" Karstens accepted. While Stuck had been traveling in Alaska for several years for his work and had experience mountain climbing, Karstens had the greater experience, which he applied as guide to the small expedition. Its other members were Walter Harper and Robert Tatum, both 21 at the time. In addition, two Gwich'in youths from Stuck's mission school, Johnny Fredson and Esias George, supported the party by managing its dog teams, and in base camp by hunting for meat and organizing supplies. (Fredson later became the first Alaska Native to graduate from college and was a lifelong leader of the Gwich'in people, founding their Venetie Indian Reserve in 1941). The expedition party left from Nenana on March 17, 1913, and proceeded up the Tanana River valley. The first day, they hiked up the Tanana with two sleds of supplies pulled by fourteen dogs. The trip up the river to Eureka took eight days; there, they replenished supplies and celebrated Easter. After leaving Eureka, the terrain became rougher, and the expedition's pace slowed to about a day. At an elevation of 2,000 feet (610 m), the party established base camp near the tree line of the mountain, where they encountered temperatures as low as . They set off again, up the crevasse-filled, steep Muldrow Glacier. While they were camping at the top of the glacier, a tent full of supplies and food was accidentally burned. It took three weeks for Harper and Fredson to go to and return from base camp to replace their supplies. The next step was the northeast ridge (later named the Karstens Ridge in the guide's honor). A previous expedition had called it \\"step , but practicable,\\" so Karstens and Stuck were surprised to find huge chunks of rocks and ice in their path. These had been upturned by an earthquake the previous summer. The expedition's progress slowed considerably while they maneuvered under, over, or sometimes through the debris. They camped on the ridge for three days, where temperatures ranged from during the day to at night. It took them three weeks to dig a road three miles long through the blockage of materials in their path. The party the year before had passed this area easily before the earthquake. After that, they climbed the upper glacier. Looking at the North Summit through field glasses, they saw a flagstaff set up by Thomas Lloyd and three other men; his party had reached it three years earlier. Known as the \\"Sourdough Expedition\\", Lloyd's party had found their achievement doubted because others had not witnessed it. On June 6, the Karstens-Stuck party made their final camp at an elevation of . At the time, it was the highest camp ever established in North America. At 4:00 the next morning, the group left camp for their final attempt at the summit. Around noon, they stopped briefly in a small shelter. The remaining went very slowly because the thin air made breathing difficult; they had to stop every few steps to catch their breath. At about 1:30 p.m., they reached the summit of Denali, an elevation of . They spent an hour and a half on the summit, during which Robert Tatum planted the American flag he had made earlier from red, white, and blue handkerchiefs. Tatum said, \\"The scenery was of indescribable beauty...It was like looking out of a window of heaven.\\" After reading their instruments and calculating the altitude, they began their descent. In contrast to the 50-day journey up the mountain, the trip back to base camp took only two days. The expedition returned to Tanana on June 20, three months and four days after they left. While they were still at base camp, Stuck sent out a messenger to announce their success, claiming credit as leader of the expedition, and it was published in The New York Times on June 21. According to Tom Walker's 2013 biography of Karstens, he and Stuck had a falling out a short time after the climb was completed, and cut off relations, Karstens even calling him an \\"absolute paresite & liar.\\" Karstens' role in the expedition became obscured, and Stuck received most of the publicity. Later life Highly recommended by Charles Sheldon, Karstens was appointed as the first superintendent of the newly established Denali National Park, serving from 1921 to his resignation in October 1928. The park received no funds for administration until that year. During his tenure, Karstens developed improved infrastructure, such as roads in the park. He organized ranger patrols to reduce poaching of game. He also supervised the construction of cabins for use by the rangers, of which the Riley Creek Ranger Cabin No. 20 is an example. Built in 1931 after Karstens had left, it has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Legacy *In 1913, Stuck named the Karstens Ridge in the guide's honor. It is located in Denali National Park, east of the summit of Denali. *In 1946, climber Bradford Washburn named the Karstens Col in his honor. The high pass is located between Mount Koven and the Karstens Ridge.

Born in Dole, Jura in the Jura Mountains, B√©thouart graduated from Saint-Cyr military academy and served as a platoon leader in the 159th Alpine Infantry Regiment during World War I. After the First World War, he served as an advisor to the Royal Yugoslav Army and was named an instructor at the French High Mountain Military School. Promoted to Colonel in 1937, B√©thouart was made a brevet Brigadier in January 1940. This promotion was made permanent in April 1941 and was followed by promotion to Major General in December 1942. B√©thouart was promoted again to Lieutenant General in November 1943, and then to General in 1948. B√©thouart commanded the French 1st Division of Chasseurs (elite light infantry) in the Norwegian campaign in 1940, serving in the area of Narvik. Subsequently, B√©thouart commanded the Casablanca Division of French forces in Morocco and assisted the Allies in rallying the French troops in Morocco to the Allied cause in November 1942. Arrested by Vichy French officials on 10 November 1942, B√©thouart was liberated by the Allies on 14 November. Later, B√©thouart served as the chief of the French military mission in Washington from December 1942 until November 1943 and as the Chief of Staff of the (French) Committee for National Defense from April 1944 until August 1944. In August 1944, B√©thouart briefly served as the Chief of Staff of Arm√©e B, later known as the French First Army. On 1 September 1944, B√©thouart took command of the French I Corps in General de Lattre's Arm√©e B. B√©thouart commanded the corps with distinction for the remainder of the war in Europe. He fought with 140,000 men in Alsace but became famous for his part in the offensive in Germany with his corps becoming the first Allied troops to reach the Danube and enter Austria. His corps is credited with taking 101,556 Germans prisoner during the campaigns to liberate France and invade Germany. During the postwar period, B√©thouart served first as the chief of French occupation forces in Austria, and then as the High Commissioner for France in Austria between 1946 and 1950. B√©thouart subsequently served as a senateur for overseas French citizens from 1955 until 1971. He died in Fr√©jus on the 17 October 1982, and was buried in Rue. In June 2003, amid pomp and ceremony, a bridge was named for him in Innsbruck.

The term is frequently used in connection with oceanography, marine or ocean engineering, ocean exploration, remotely operated vehicle (ROVs) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), submarine communications or power cables, seafloor mineral mining, oil and gas, and offshore wind power. Oil and gas Oil and gas fields reside beneath many inland waters and offshore areas around the world, and in the oil and gas industry the term subsea relates to the exploration, drilling and development of oil and gas fields in these underwater locations. Under water oil fields and facilities are generically referred to using a subsea prefix, such as subsea well, subsea field, subsea project, and subsea developments. Subsea oil field developments are usually split into Shallow water and Deepwater categories to distinguish between the different facilities and approaches that are needed. The term shallow water or shelf is used for very shallow water depths where bottom- founded facilities like jackup drilling rigs and fixed offshore structures can be used, and where saturation diving is feasible. Deepwater is a term often used to refer to offshore projects located in water depths greater than around ,Oil field Glossary - Deepwater Play : http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=deep%2Dwater%20play where floating drilling vessels and floating oil platforms are used, and remotely operated underwater vehicles are required as manned diving is not practical. Subsea completions can be traced back to 1943 with the Lake Erie completion at a water depth. The well had a land-type Christmas tree that required diver intervention for installation, maintenance, and flow line connections.(2010) International Petroleum Encyclopedia. Retrieved November 09, 2010, from http://www.pennenergy.com/index/petroleum/international- petroleum-encyclopedia/display/114882/ipes/online-research- center/volume-1999/issue-1/encyclopedia/special-features/new-features-improve- flexibility-of-subsea-well-completions.html Shell completed its first subsea well in the Gulf of Mexico in 1961.60 Years in the Gulf of Mexico, E&P; Supplement, Hart Publishing, November 2007 =Systems= Subsea oil production systems can range in complexity from a single satellite well with a flowline linked to a fixed platform, FPSO or an onshore installation, to several wells on a template or clustered around a manifold, and transferring to a fixed or floating facility, or directly to an onshore installation.API Recommended Practice 17A Subsea production systems can be used to develop reservoirs, or parts of reservoirs, which require drilling of the wells from more than one location. Deep water conditions, or even ultradeep water conditions, can also inherently dictate development of a field by means of a subsea production system, since traditional surface facilities such as on a steel-piled jacket, might be either technically unfeasible or uneconomical due to the water depth. The development of subsea oil and gas fields requires specialized equipment. The equipment must be reliable enough to safeguard the environment and make the exploitation of the subsea hydrocarbons economically feasible. The deployment of such equipment requires specialized and expensive vessels, which need to be equipped with diving equipment for relatively shallow equipment work (i.e. a few hundred feet water depth maximum) and robotic equipment for deeper water depths. Any requirement to repair or intervene with installed subsea equipment is thus normally very expensive. This type of expense can result in economic failure of the subsea development. Subsea technology in offshore oil and gas production is a highly specialized field of application with particular demands on engineering and simulation. Most of the new oil fields are located in deep water and are generally referred to as deepwater systems. Development of these fields sets strict requirements for verification of the various systems‚Äô functions and their compliance with current requirements and specifications. This is because of the high costs and time involved in changing a pre-existing system due to the specialized vessels with advanced onboard equipment. A full-scale test (System Integration Test ‚Äì SIT) does not provide satisfactory verification of deepwater systems because the test, for practical reasons, cannot be performed under conditions identical to those under which the system will later operate. The oil industry has therefore adopted modern data technology as a tool for virtual testing of deepwater systems that enables detection of costly faults at an early phase of the project. By using modern simulation tools, models of deepwater systems can be set up and used to verify the system's functions, and dynamic properties, against various requirements specifications. This includes the model-based development of innovative high-tech plants and system solutions for the exploitation and production of energy resources in an environmentally friendly way as well as the analysis and evaluation of the dynamic behavior of components and systems used for the production and distribution of oil and gas. Another part is the real-time virtual test of systems for subsea production, subsea drilling, supply above sea level, seismography, subsea construction equipment, and subsea process measurement and control equipment. Offshore wind power The power transmission infrastructure for offshore wind power utilizes a variety of subsea technologies for the installation and maintenance of submarine power transmission cables and other electrical energy equipment. Global Marine Systems on the future of offshore wind cabling , Wind Energy Update, 2009-09-10, accessed 2011-07-30. In addition, the monopile foundations of fixed-bottom wind turbines and the anchoring and cable structures of floating wind turbines are regularly inspected with a variety of shipborne subsea technology. Underwater mining Recent technological advancements have given rise to the use of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to collect mineral samples from prospective mine sites. Using drills and other cutting tools, the ROVs obtain samples to be analyzed for desired minerals. Once a site has been located, a mining ship or station is set up to mine the area.Treasure on the ocean floor, Economist 381, no. 8506:10, EBSCOhost, (accessed January 19, 2010). Seafloor mineral mining of seafloor massive sulfide deposits (so named for the sulfide molecules, not the deposit size) are a developing subsea mineral mining industry. Nautilus Minerals Inc. is establishing a new industry by commercially exploring and, in the future, extracting copper, gold, silver and zinc in its Solwara 1 Project. The project is establishing its operations beneath the ocean surface in the Bismarck Sea near Papua New Guinea. When fully underway this operation will be the world‚Äôs first commercial deep-sea mining project, with first production expected to begin in 2017. Remotely operated vehicles Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are robotic pieces of equipment operated from afar to perform tasks on the sea floor. ROVs are available in a wide variety of function capabilities and complexities from simple \\"eyeball\\" camera devices, to multi-appendage machines that require multiple operators to operate or \\"fly\\" the equipment. Other Professional Equipments used in installation of Sub Sea Telecommunication cable are specially designed crafts, modular barges, Water Pump along with Diving support and other accessories to seamlessly conduct installation operations in Deep Sea and Near Shore end, Rivers, Lakes. There are few professional companies in the world who own, operate such equipments and carry out operations worldwide on turnkey basis. Energy harvesting and production Subsea energy technologies are the subject of investigation using a number of technical strategies, none of which have yet been commercialized to become viable products or new energy industries. Energy sources under investigation include utility scale power production from ocean currents, such as the rapid currents found in the waters between the Florida Straits and Cape Hatteras. Research and projects are developing to harvest energy from hydrothermal vents to provide power for subsea ocean research instruments, developing autonomous vehicle recharge technologies, seabed sensor systems, and environmental research applications. Other investigations include harvesting energy from differences in temperature that occur with varied ocean depth, and microbial fuel cells that produce energy from organisms in ocean seafloor sediments. . Current methods for providing power for electric applications on offshore seabeds are limited to the use of batteries, power provided from generators on ships or platforms with fossil fuel generators, or for lower power requirements, wind, solar, or wave energy harvesting buoys. . Organizations A number of professional societies and trade bodies are involved with the subsea industry around the world. Such groups include *Subsea Engineering Society *Society for Underwater Technology *Subsea Project Awards *Subsea UK *Subsea Valley The largest subsea technology business cluster. *Society of Petroleum Engineers *American Petroleum Institute (API) *American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) *National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE). *International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) Government agencies administer regulations in their territorial waters around the world. Examples of such government agencies are the Minerals Management Service (MMS, US), Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD, Norway), and Health & Safety Executive (HSE, UK). The MMS administers the mineral resources in the US (using Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) and provides management of all the US subsea mineral and renewable energy resources.

Early life Goldin was of Polish Jewish descent and was born Hyman Elias Goldstein in Vilnius, which was then part of Russia but is now the capital of Lithuania. Sources differ as to his date of birth, some give it as 17 December 1873 and some as an unspecified date in 1874. An accident when he was young left him with a speech impediment. It has been said he showed a talent for magic tricks when he was young after he began learning from a gypsy performer. When he was 16 his family emigrated to the United States and settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where they ran a store. Despite the combination of a strong accent and a speech impediment, young Goldstein managed to make a living as a salesman. His introduction to a performing career came when he was apprenticed to touring showman Adolph Veidt, who influenced him to take the stage name Horace Goldin. Goldin began performing magic on a part-time basis around 1894, combining tricks and jokes and billing himself as \\"The Humorous Conjurer\\". After he received poor reviews from newspapers he tried again with a new act, for which he hired assistants and adopted a rapid presentation style said to have been inspired by seeing German-born magician Imro Fox (1862‚Äì1910). Goldin did tricks quickly one after another without speaking and became known as \\"The Whirlwind Illusionist\\". With this act he found success in vaudeville and began touring the United States. In 1901 he went to London to perform at the Palace Theatre. His British shows made sufficient impact for him to be invited to do a private show for King Edward VII and royal guests at Sandringham in November 1902. In 1905 he appeared in a short comedy film made in the UK and titled Comic Conjuring. In 1915 he set out on a long tour of the Far East but this ended in disaster in 1918 when a boat carrying his equipment sank at Lahaina, Hawaii. Worse still, Goldin distrusted banks and carried his money with him (reputedly in gold) and that went to the bottom along with his props. He was forced into bankruptcy on returning home. However he was about to enter the most successful phase of his career with his development of the illusion sawing a woman in half. The sawing illusion Goldin's sawing a woman in half illusion Goldin is often credited with inventing the sawing a woman in half illusion, however the first public presentation of this type of illusion was by British magician P. T. Selbit in 1921. Goldin presented his own version of the trick a matter of months later. There remains a debate about the origin of the idea, with some sources saying a magician named Torrini may have performed the first version in front of Pope Pius VII in 1809. It has also been suggested that the trick can be traced back to ancient Egypt. However there is a lack of solid and available evidence for these claims. There seems to be broad agreement that Selbit was the first to present the illusion on stage and that Goldin achieved a place in history through subsequent technical development and promotion. Goldin's initial version was claimed as an improvement over Selbit's because the assistant's head, hands and feet remained visible during the sawing whereas Selbit's assistant was totally obscured from view inside a box. Goldin later devised a version that dispensed with a box entirely and used a large buzzsaw. Goldin's success owed a great deal to presentation and promotion skills and a certain amount to his persistence in suing other magicians. The Keith theatre firm hired Goldin and took on six additional sets of performers to take versions of his show on tour around the United States. Among those performers was Servais Le Roy, a Belgian who was previously one of Goldin‚Äôs rivals. Promotional stunts employed for the shows included ambulances outside the theatres and performers dressed as medics to give the impression there was a real risk of serious injury. Goldin was involved in many lawsuits during this phase of his career. There are suggestions that many of these cases were motivated by publicity as well as any genuine grounds for action. However he successfully used the courts to prevent competition from other magicians. In one case he managed to obtain an injunction against Selbit over the sawing illusion despite the fact that each man had a fundamentally different version of the trick and Selbit performed his first. In other cases Goldin took on the makers of films that exposed methods behind illusions. In Goldin v. Clarion Photoplays in New York in 1922 he initially lost because the judge said he had not proved he was the original inventor of the sawing illusion and the trick possibly dated back to ancient Egypt. However Goldin appealed and won with a ruling that stated he had \\"satisfactorily established that he is the originator of the illusion in question, which has achieved a great success under the title devised by him of Sawing a Woman in Half...and that his creation of the illusion has been so universally recognized that the title thereof is in the public mind associated with his own name\\" Goldin v. Clarion Photoplays, New York (Dec 1922) The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 32, No. 2, p.201 Some of Goldin's legal tactics resulted in problems even though they were technically successful. One such was his patenting of Sawing a woman in half. He applied for a patent in September 1921 and was awarded U.S. patent number 1,458,575 on 12 June 1923. This gave him legal right to an exclusive monopoly on his invention for 17 years and thus made it easier for him to prevent other magicians from using his methods. However patents require inventors to reveal the workings of their inventions, which meant Goldin could no longer keep his methods completely secret. In the 1930s this brought Goldin into confrontation with the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the maker of Camel cigarettes, which was running an advertising campaign aimed at debunking the publicity for a competing brand. Reynolds used the slogan \\"It's fun to be fooled...It's more fun to know\\" and ran adverts showing the secrets behind famous mysteries. In 1933 they produced one with a picture showing the workings of a version of sawing a woman in half. Goldin sued but the case was eventually dismissed by a federal court in 1938. After that Goldin gave up on litigation over the sawing illusion and focused instead on secrecy. For example he never patented his later sawing illusion in which a giant buzzsaw blade appears to cut through an assistant. Success and end of his career Goldin claimed the cost of his lawsuits ate up any proceeds he made from his inventions in spite of seeming financially successful. It was said he made a million dollars for the Keith theatre group and that he sometimes earned as much as US$2,000 dollars a week. He toured internationally with his sawing illusions. He performed for King Edward VII of Britain on four occasions, earning the billing \\"Royal Illusionist\\", and also appeared before American presidents Harding and Wilson. In 1936 he appeared in a movie revue made in the UK titled Stars on Parade. Death In his later years Goldin became a British citizen. He died on August 21, 1939 following a show at the Wood Green Empire Theatre in London. Twenty-one years earlier at that venue a magician named Chung Ling Soo had been killed while performing the bullet catch illusion. Goldin performed the same trick successfully but died in his sleep later.

Due to errors in the flight control system while out of the range of ground control, the station fired its attitude thruster until it consumed all of its attitude control fuel and became uncontrollable before raising its orbit to the desired altitude.

It is located about 3 km from W√ºrzburg. The name of the village stems from the contraction of the Althochdeutsche word Ger (throwing spear, because the village had originally the appearance of a spear) and Brunn (source, after the water source that is still flowing today near the city hall). Another explanation does not trace the \\"Ger\\" in \\"Gerbrunn\\" to the throwing spear, but to an affluent Frankish aristocrat named Gerwine, who owned a water source in the area of Gerbrunn (\\"Gerwines Brunnen\\"). An alternative theory states that the \\"Ger\\" comes from the traditional local dish \\"Gerstrau√ü\\". History In 1107 Gerbrunn was recognized for the first time in an official document. Gerbrunn became a part of the Hochstift W√ºrzburg until 1803 when it was secularized and added to Bayern. In the Peace of Pre√üburg (1805) archduke Ferdinand von Toskana made it a part of the Grand Duchy of W√ºrzburg. The Grand Duchy itself was added to Bayern in 1814. In the wake of administration reformation in Bayern, the current community was formed with the municipal edict of 1818. Coat of arms The arms of Gerbrunn consists of three parts: the left upper part include the symbol of Castell (Unterfranken), right above the symbol of the Frankish Empire is shown; below the source is pictured. The coat of arms also functions as the logo of local sports club TSV Gerbrunn.

It was single-engine, high-wing aircraft with fixed tail skid landing gear. Two examples were built. Design and development The aircraft was designed to meet Air Ministry Specification 33/27, issued by the Directorate of Technical Development (DTD) in December 1927 after the failure of three attempts by the RAF to break the absolute distance world record flying Hawker Horsley bombers.Taylor 1977, p. 18. According to a Ministry spokesman in the House of Commons, this aircraft was to be constructed not just \\"for a specific record,\\" but as a serious study into methods of increasing the range of aircraft. In order to soothe the anxieties of the Treasury, the aircraft started life as the Postal Aircraft. The pointed nose and sleek lines of the prototype gave rise to the nickname \\"Eversharp,\\" after the maker of pens and mechanical pencils.Winchester 2005, p. 37. Although other configurations were studied, after wind tunnel testing a high wing was chosen, allowing a gravity feed from the fuel tanks. The wing's spars were of wood with a steel pyramid system of internal bracing intended to add torsional rigidity and ensure that flight loads were evenly distributed between the spars irrespective of the position of the centre of pressure, and were fabric covered. The fuel capacity was 1,043 Imp gals (4,742 L) and the system used a gravity feed and mechanical fuel pump in sequence; a wind-driven, emergency back-up pump was also provided. There were other features dedicated to the long-range function; there were two parallel oil filter circuits, allowing one filter to be removed and cleaned while the other remained in operation. The aircraft was even equipped with a pneumatic bed for a reserve pilot. After extensive testing using a Fairey IIIF and a DH.9A, the Napier Lion XIA of was selected late in the design process. Operational history The first built, J9479, flew for the first time on 14 November 1928 from RAF Northolt.Taylor 1977, p. 19. The aircraft was handed over to the RAF on 7 December, and testing continued in preparation for the record attempt, including a 24-hour trial on 22‚Äì23 March 1929. It was decided to attempt a flight to Bangalore in India, a great-circle distance of about 5,000 mile (8,000 km), comfortably in excess of the existing record of 4,466 miles (7,188 km) set by a Savoia- Marchetti S.64 in July 1928. Squadron Leader A. G. Jones-Williams and Flight Lieutenant N. H. Jenkins set off from RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire on 24 April 1929. The aircraft was slowed by headwinds, and they landed at Karachi after 50 hours 48 minutes in the air. Although the flight was the first non-stop flight between Britain and India, the great circle distance of 4,130 miles (6,646 km) was short of the world records.Taylor 1977, pp. 19‚Äì20. It was decided to make another record attempt later that year, although the record had been raised to 4,912 miles (8,007 km) by the Breguet 19 Point d'Interrogation. This time it was planned to fly from England to South Africa. This second attempt, with the same crew as the first, took off on 16 December 1929, but crashed south of Tunis, destroying the aircraft and killing the crew.Taylor 1977, pp. 20‚Äì21. The navigation log was recovered from the crash site; according to this the aircraft's altitude at 18:00 was . However, the barographs with which the aircraft was fitted recorded an altitude of less than at this time. The impact point was above sea level. Two possible causes are that the log entry was erroneous and that the aircraft had, due to the poor weather, descended and that the difference in barometric pressure between Tunisia and Cranwell had caused them to believe that their altitude was greater than was the case; an alternative explanation is simply that the altimeter had failed.Taylor 1974, p.187 Despite this setback, the Air Ministry ordered a second Long-range Monoplane (K1991) in July 1930, this flying on 30 June 1931. While similar to the first aircraft, it had a number of differences, including the addition of an autopilot and wheel spats.Taylor 1977, p. 21.Cooksley 1993, p. 52. Gayford and Nicholetts with Lord Londonderry and Sir John Salmond On 27‚Äì28 October 1931 Squadron Leader O. R. Gayford (the officer in charge of the RAF Long Range Development Unit) and Flight Lieutenant D. Betts as navigator flew K1991 from RAF Cranwell to Abu Seir in Egypt. The was completed in 31¬Ω hours.Thetford 1976, p.246 From 6‚Äì8 February 1933, Gayford and his navigator Flight Lieutenant G. E. Nicholetts flew non- stop in the second aircraft, K1991, from Cranwell to Walvis Bay, South West Africa. This was a world long-distance record of 5,410 mi (8,540 km). On their return to RAE Farnborough they were met by the Air Minister (Lord Londonderry), Under Secretary for Air (Sir Philip Sassoon) and Sir John Salmond, Marshal of the Royal Air Force. The distance record stood until August 1933 when it was taken back by the French. Gayford and the LRDU would later make long-distance flights with the Vickers Wellesley. After K1991 flew back to the United Kingdom a number of suggestions to re-engine the aircraft were made and the Air Ministry issued Specification 27/33 for it to be re- engined with a Jumo engine; the aircraft was reconditioned but it was decided to design a new aircraft instead.Meekcoms/Morgan 1994, p.6 Not needed, K1991 was scrapped.

Professional wrestling career In August 1981, Moffat attacked a Stampede Wrestling wrestler in the ring, and was tackled through the ropes onto a table. Moffat debuted in Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion in 1983 under the name Karl \\"Butch\\" Moffat. During the mid-1980s, he would win several tag team titles including (Vancouver) All Star Tag Team Championship and the Grand Prix Tag Team Championship in 1984 and 1985. He also had a successful singles career with the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico, twice winning that promotion's Television Championship as well as its Caribbean and Tag Team titles between 1987 and 1989. Moffat also had a successful run with Stampede Wrestling, feuding with Owen Hart as Jason the Terrible, with white overalls, a hockey mask, and a chainsaw. However, Bret Hart claims that he was bleeding too much in his matches. Ross Hart agrees, saying that \\"it was a bit of a turn off with our audience\\", although Ross also stated that Moffatt was a good wrestler and that he was a big fan of his character. Moffat won the Canadian Rocky Mountain Wrestling North American Championship twice in 1993 and 1994, winning it from Chris Jericho and Eric Freeze. On September 23, 1994, he teamed with Randy Rudd and defeated Sonny Corleone and Rob Austin to win the Canadian Rocky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championships. In 1998, he wrestled two matches for Steve Wilde and Otto Gentile's Can-Am Wrestling Federation, losing to both Dr. Hannibal (in a Falls count anywhere match) and the Cuban Assassin. In 2004, Moffat wrestled three matches in Top Ranked Wrestling, one singles match and two tag team matches. He won his first singles match, before winning one and losing one of the tag- team matches. Later that year, Moffat lost to R.A.G.E. in All Star Pro Wrestling, in what was his final match. Karl Moffatt made his return to the ring under the Jason the Terrible gimmick for Real Canadian Wrestling in Edmonton where he teamed with Katana to face C-Block in a bloody street fight. Moffatt return to RCW March 2013 to win the Canadian Tag titles with Partner Steven Styles by defeating C-Block in a Bloody brawl. Jason/Styles lost the tag titles to The Hardliners on May 24 in Camrose, Alberta. Moffat, as Jason The Terrible did do a show for Hart Legacy Wrestling in Calgary, Alberta, but he and other wrestlers were not paid. Personal life Moffat says that he wasn't friends with most wrestlers, he kept his personal and professional life separate. While travelling with fellow Stampede Wrestling veterans Davey Boy Smith and Chris Benoit, Moffat suffered massive injuries to his left leg following a head-on collision in Jasper, Alberta on July 4, 1989. It took five years and nine operations to put him back together. That injury shortened his career. Moffat is currently a truck driver in British Columbia.

History of Giebelstadt The town is the birthplace of Florian Geyer (1490‚Äì1525), also known as \\"Florian Geier from Giebelstadt\\", a Franconian nobleman who led the Black Company during the German Peasants' War resulting from the Protestant Reformation in Germany in the 16th century. Florian led the revolt to the Bishop's Residence in W√ºrzburg where the revolt was repressed. In 1935, the construction of the Giebelstadt airfield was authorized. It was first operated by the German Luftwaffe in World War II. During this time, Adolf Hitler built an escape railroad track that led to the airfield, which was discovered by the U.S. Army in 1945. Giebelstadt supported 5,786 soldiers and their families during the U.S. Army's 62-year history until its closure along with the U.S. Forces draw down of W√ºrzburg area in 2006. The airfield has since been renamed Giebelstadt Airport to host civilian flight operations. At the closure of the airfield it was found that there were more than 200 items of unexploded ordnance within and in the surrounding grounds of the barracks where single soldiers were housed. Scenery and Culture The town is surrounded by fields characterized by a rolling landscape.

Life Saint-Pol was the eldest son of Peter of Luxembourg and Margaret de Baux. His older sister Jacqueline, better known as Jacquetta of Luxembourg, married John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, and Louis was initially a supporter of the Lancastrian cause in the English Wars of the Roses. He was brought up by his uncle, John II of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny, who named Louis as heir to his estates. However, King Charles VII of France sequestrated the estates on John's death in 1441. As a result, Saint-Pol sought a rapprochement with the French king and duly had his inheritance restored to him. However, the county of Guise was claimed by Charles, Count of Maine. The affair was settled by an agreement that Saint- Pol's sister Isabelle would marry the Count of Maine and receive the disputed lands as her dowry. War against the King Saint-Pol became a close friend of the Dauphin Louis, the future King Louis XI of France and fought with him in Flanders and in Normandy. However, in 1465 Saint-Pol broke with his friend, now King, to join with the King's brother, Charles, Duke of Berry in the League of the Public Weal. At the battle of Montlh√©ry, he commanded the van of Charles the Bold's army, yet later was made constable of France by Louis XI. The Treaty of Conflans ended the war, while Saint-Pol received the hand of the King's sister-in-law, Maria of Savoy. After this, he was persistently disloyal to the King, conspiring with Charles, Count of Charolais, and with Edward IV of England, his nephew by marriage. The final treason came in 1474 when Saint- Pol approached Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who had already entered into a compact with Edward IV of England to dismember France in a renewal of the Hundred Years' War. The scheme envisaged the murder of Louis and the sub- division of France between Saint-Pol, the Dukes of Burgundy, Brittany, Bourbon and Nemours, the Count of Maine and King Edward. Saint-Pol then proceeded to draw other magnates into the conspiracy. The whole thing started to unravel after Louis and Edward concluded the Treaty of Picquigny in August 1475. Angered by this, Saint-Pol was imprudent enough to write to Edward, upbraiding him as a \\"cowardly, dishonoured and beggarly king\\". Edward promptly forwarded the letter to Louis, who now had all the proof he needed. A messenger was sent to the conspirator, in which he was informed that the King had 'need of a head such as his.' He was arrested in September 1475, and later imprisoned in the Bastille. Execution followed in December. Philippe de Commynes, the chief chronicler of Louis' reign, was to write that Saint-Pol had been \\"abandoned by God because he had tried with all his might to prolong the hostilities between the King and the Duke of Burgundy.\\" From 1468 to 1472 his chaplain was the well-known translator, author and scribe Jean Mi√©lot. Marriage and children Louis de Luxembourg married twice, first to Jeanne de Bar, Countess of Marle and Soissons (died 1462), and secondly to Marie of Savoy.

Geography = Municipal structure = Helmstadt consists of two districts: * Helmstadt * Holzkirchhausen = Neighboring municipalities = * Holzkirchen * Uettingen * Waldb√ºttelbrunn * Irtenberger Wald * Altertheim * Neubrunn * Wertheim  Name = Etymology = The name Helmstadt consists of the first name Adalhalm and the Old High German word stat. It thus means dwelling of Adalhalm. = Historical spellings = * 770 Adalhalmestat * 816 Halabingestat * 1246 Helbingestat * 1305 Heblingestat * 1335 Helmstat * 1559 Helmstadt * 1800 Markthelmstadt * 1831 Helmstadt  History = Early history = A first settling of the region took place at the time of the Linear Pottery culture between 6000 and 4000 BC, as evidenced by archeological findings at the Altersberg, Ameisenberg and in the Hochstatt. For the time after that, no findings are known. Another settlement at the Roth was established at the time of the Urnfield culture between 1200 and 750 BC. During the development of the Roth between 1999 and 2000 AD, excavations were conducted in the area, and numerous shard and pole pit findings were recorded. The existing settlement then grew in size between 750 and 450 BC, at the time of the Hallstatt culture. After that, however, any signs of a settlement disappeared. = Middle Ages = The area was only settled anew at the beginning of the Middle Ages. The settlers were so-called \\"Waldsassen\\"‚Äîpeople settling in the woods‚Äîafter whom the region was also named in medieval times: Waldsassengau. A formal foundation of the village likely took place between 680 and 750 AD. The first documented mention of the village occurs in 772, under the name of \\"Adalhalmestat\\". On 20 January 772, the right to tithe the village and the neighboring Uettingen was transferred from the owner of the villages, a noble clergyman called Alwalah, to the Benedictine Fulda monastery. In the centuries that were to follow, the affiliated daughter monastery of Holzkirchen and the counts of Wertheim shared the power over the village. The associated parish was first mentioned in 1209. At the turn of the years 1466 and 1467, the village was burned down completely as a result of a feud between the count of Wertheim and the Teutonic Order. = Modern history = Prinz Ludwig Memorial on 3 October 1909 Prince Ludwig walking along the honor guard made up of war veterans After the house of the counts of Wertheim had died out in the male line with the death of Michael III, the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg claimed ownership of the village. In 1612, prince-bishop Julius Echter incorporated the village into the bishopric. The title of Vogt was passed down to the Nurembergian patrician families of Haller von Hallerstein, Imhof and von Buirette, who exercised this right until the beginning of the 19th century. During the Thirty Years' War, the village was repeatedly occupied and looted by troops of various affiliations. The right to organise markets was awarded to the village on 1 October 1770 by the prince- bishop of W√ºrzburg and Bamberg, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim. During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, a battle between royal Prussian and Bavarian troops allied with the Austrian Empire took place near the village on 25 July 1866. Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, who should later be crowned King Ludwig III of Bavaria, suffered a shot wound during the assault. In order to commemorate this occasion, a memorial named Prinz-Ludwig-Denkmal was erected near the village exit towards W√ºrzburg. It was unveiled on 3 October 1909 in the presence of the Prince and veterans of the war of 1866. During World War I, 48 soldiers from Helmstadt and 12 soldiers from Holzkirchhausen died at the frontlines. World War II claimed another 111 respectively 31 victims of the two villages. Apart from that, several disabled citizens were murdered by the Nazis. The village was liberated without resistance by approaching US-American troops on 2 April 1945, an Easter Monday. = Today = Helmstadt is a politically autonomous municipality. On 1 May 1978, the previously autonomous municipality of Holzkirchhausen was incorporated into Helmstadt as a result of a local government reorganization. This reorganization also resulted in Helmstadt being incorporated into the district of W√ºrzburg. Previously, it had been part of the now dissolved district of Marktheidenfeld. = Population development = * 1961: 1.923 * 1970: 2.097 * 1987: 2.307 * 2000: 2.669 * 2004: 2.639 * 2011: 2.579 * 2015: 2.571  Politics  Helmstadt has been the seat of the association of administrations of the same name since 1 May 1978. The association includes Helmstadt with Holzkirchhausen, Holzkirchen with W√ºstenzell, Remlingen and Uettingen. Since 20 November 2014, Helmstadt is organised in the so-called Allianz Waldsassengau, together with twelve surrounding municipalities. The association serves the promotion of intercommunal cooperation. = Coat of arms = The right to use a coat of arms was first granted to Helmstadt in 1589, by Louis III, Count of L√∂wenstein, then ruling count of Wertheim. Apart from three roses attributed to the county of Wertheim, the coat of arms also displays a tool handle, a so- called Halm or Helbling, which can also be found in some of the earlier names of Helmstadt. The blazon reads: \\"Three red six-petaled heraldic roses on a golden background, divided in one and two; between them, a horizontal blue tool handle\\". = Twin towns = Helmstadt is twinned with: * Italy Chiusi della Verna (Italy)  Economy and infrastructure  Memorial for Hans B√∂hm, erected in 2007 The village has both doctor and dentist's offices, a pharmacy, a kindergarten and a primary school. Various companies, including the Deutsche Post AG and banks, offer employment in the village. = Education = The following institutions exist (2015): * Catholic kindergarten St. Josef (3 kindergarten groups with 75 children, 2 toddler groups with 24 children) * Catholic kindergarten St. √Ñgidius (district of Holzkirchhausen, 1 kindergarten group with 15 children) * Astrid Lindgren elementary school (elementary school association, 12 classes with about 280 pupils)  Religion  Both Helmstadt and Holzkirchhausen are largely Catholic municipalities.

Benedikt zwischen Tauber & Main, which has its seat in Helmstadt and which also includes the rectories of B√∂ttigheim, Holzkirchen, Neubrunn, Uettingen, Remlingen, and W√ºstenzell. The parish association, in turn, is part of the church district of W√ºrzburg on the left side of the Main and is thus subject to the diocese of the bishopric of W√ºrzburg.

Born in Brampton, Ontario, in 1968, Darren Copeland has been active as an electroacoustic composer and sound designer since 1985 producing works for concert, radio, theater, dance, and site-specific installation. Music His entry into music and sound was unusual. In the 1980s as a teenager he discovered analog synthesizers almost by accident. And with no previous formal musical training or even interest in music, he started studying analog synthesizers and early digital samplers through private studies with Pier Rubesa in Toronto. This led to the creation of his own compositions and collaborations with musician Ed Troscianczyk and poet/visual artist John Marriott and others in the experimental music scene in Toronto. With these artists, Darren self-published a number of cassette compilations of the work produced at this time, including Living it Out - in the Dear Air - Space, The Three Faces, Mahwje's Outlook, An Introduction in Frost, and Dreams of Darkness. After high school Darren studied theater sound design at Niagara College and parallel to this began making pieces using only environmental sounds. He then moved to Vancouver from 1989 to '95 to study electroacoustic composition at Simon Fraser University and was introduced to the research of the World Soundscape Project through his studies with Barry Truax which intensified his focus on soundscape composition. The compositions Faith- Annihia and Always Becoming Somebody Else included on the disc Perdu et retrouv√© and the works included on his previous empreintes DIGITALes release Rendu visible are an outcome of this intensive investigation of soundscape recordings and electroacoustic composition. His interest in soundscape recordings was motivated by wanting to understand better the associations that different listeners had to various environmental sounds. Reactions to pieces like Always Becoming Somebody Else and others from that period often brought very personal and contradictory reactions from listeners. Darren at the time concluded that this might have something to do with the visual bias of western society and the lack of a common vocabulary for talking about sound in everyday experience. He felt that there were two solutions that would help him to better understand the visual bias of the listener: one was to investigate the nature of listening and perception more; the other solution was to combine sounds with texts and stories in order to present sounds inside a specific social or psychological context that provided more of a focus to the wide array of associations latent in the listening imagination. And so, in the mid- nineties, he branched out into other forms and made pieces that moved into the realm of theater, radio documentary, radio drama, and sound-text composition. He created an adaptation of August Strindberg's (1849‚Äì1912) play A Dream Play (1901), which became the first radio drama at CBC conceived for broadcast in Surround 5.1. In 1996-97, Darren undertook his postgraduate studies at University of Birmingham (UK) and completed his soundscape documentary Life Unseen in which he investigated how blind people listen and function in a visual-centered society. Following this intensive study at Birmingham, he composed The Toronto Sound Mosaic, the soundtrack for Samuel Beckett's (1906‚Äì89) play That Time (1975) (produced by Threshold Theater), and his text- sound composition Lapse in Perception (produced for CBC Radio program Out Front). Through the late-nineties to 2002, Darren collaborated heavily in the theater and dance community in Toronto making soundtracks that integrated sound in a compelling fashion and this process also brought insight into the associative qualities of environmental sounds. More recently, he has returned to abstraction again, using more sounds that are not environmental or recognizable. Works such as They're Trying to Save Themselves, Streams of Whispers and The Wrong Mistakes represent this interest, but have a similar dynamic flow and textural sense to the earlier works that use environmental sounds. Other works like On Schedule and On a Strange Road use environmental sounds in a more conceptual way and are less conscious of rendering the acoustic environment in a faithful or believable fashion. As well as being a sound artist and composer, Darren Copeland is also the Artistic Director of New Adventures in Sound Art (NAISA), which produces electroacoustic and experimental sound art events in Toronto (Canada). With NAISA he has also toured Europe and Canada performing in concerts, facilitating workshops, and giving lectures with a focus on octophonic spatialization. He also currently serves on the board of directors for the Canadian Association for Sound Ecology (CASE), and previously for the Canadian Electroacoustic Community (CEC), Vancouver Pro Musica, and Rumble Productions.

Although substantially lower than the highest peaks of the region, it towers dramatically over the valley of the Alaknanda River and rises above the Hindu pilgrimage site of Badrinath, only to the east. Frank Smythe described the peak as \\"second only to Siniolchu in Himalayan beauty.\\"American Alpine Journal, 1956, p. 77 The Satopanth Glacier lies on the northwest side of Nilkantha, below a face of the peak. The Panpatia Glacier lies to the southwest, and feeds the Khirao Ganga, a stream running under the south side of the peak. Further away, to the west of the peak, lies the well- known Gangotri Glacier and its associated peaks. Across the Alaknanda valley lie the Kamet and Nanda Devi groups. Etymology (Sanskrit ; nƒ´la = \\"blue\\", ' = \\"throat\\") is one the Hindu deity, Shiva's many epithets.See: name #93 in Chidbhavananda, p. 31. In Hindu mythology, there was initially no mountain on the spot where Nilkantha stands today. There was an adage route between Kedarnath and Badrinath. The \\"Purahita\\" or the worshiper of the two temples worshiped them in one day. This continued for a long time until due to some sins of the worshiper, Shiva became displeased with him and stood blocking the way as a huge sky-kissing mountain, which is said to be modern Nilkantha.  Climbing history  With its steep ridges and faces, Nilkantha resisted seven climbing attempts, beginning with Frank Smythe in 1937.Himalayan Index (However note that this incorrectly lists the 1961 expedition as an attempt, not a successful ascent.) The peak was purportedly first climbed on 13 June 1961, by an expedition led by Col. Narinder Kumar, with Shri O.P. Sharma and Sherpas Lakpa Giyalbu and Phurba Lobsang reaching the summit. They placed their base camp on the Satopanth Glacier and ascended via the north face.American Alpine Journal 1962, p. 272. Online link.Neelkantha, Col. N. Kumar. Jagdish Nanavati, Honorary Secretary of the Himalayan Club, Bombay, studied the ascent and came to the conclusion that the expedition had gravely underestimated the route and faltered far below the summit in bad weather. Nevertheless, a committee of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation ratified the ascent late in 1963, though they recommended the expedition to be repeated the next year to confirm the terrain and timing.Harish Kapadia, High Himalaya Unknown Valleys, Indus Publishing, 2002, pp. 60-61 View of Mt. Nilkantha from Badrinath The generally accepted first ascent was made on 3 June 1974 by Sonam Pulzor, Kanhiya Lal, Dilip Singh, and Nima Dorje of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. The expedition was led by S. P. Chamoli. After unsuccessfully attempting the west ridge, they reached the summit via the north face, making three camps above base camp.American Alpine Journal, 1975, p. 208 The second ascent of Nilkantha was only in 1993 by an international team under Col. H.S. Chauhan via the north-east ridge. No fewer than 32 climbers made the summit between 31 May and 2 June. Neelkanth mountain as seen from a valley while trekking from Badrinath to Neelkanth. In 2000, five British climbers led by Martin Moran made the third ascent and the first ascent over the west ridge.Martin Moran (2002) Nilkanth West Ridge, The Alpine Journal In November 2001, the Slovenian climbers Marko Prezelj and Matic Jost repeated this route. In 2007, the Himalayan Club Calcutta claimed an ascent via the west ridge as well, but their climb was later shown to have stopped about 150 metres below the highest point on the mountain.Jagdish C. Nanavati (2001) Nilkanth Missed, The Himalayan Journal Vol 62. The Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF) has not yet formally rejected the claim. The leader of the 2007 Himalayan Club Kolkata Section AVM (Retd) Apurva Bhattacharya had made detailed technical representation on their claimed ascent up to the Summit ridge of Nilkanth. An Internal Authentication committee was set us by IMF to study the contention of the 2007 team. On detailed analysis, the authentication committee concluded that the 2007 team had indeed reached the summit ridge of Nilkanth and deemed this expedition to be successful. Communication to this end was made by IMF to the Expedition leader vide letter dated 6 August 2014.

He played senior hurling with the Tipperary inter-county team from 1988 until 2003. He also represented Tipperary in all grades in Gaelic football. He is regarded as a great hurler in Mullinahone . Early life and private life John Leahy was born in Mullinahone, County Tipperary in 1969. He was educated locally in Mullinahone N.S., Ballingarry Presentation Convent and Killenaule V.S. He later worked for United Beverages Group in Kilkenny. He is currently working as a Drug Education Officer with Health Service Executive (HSE) On 9 February 2005 Leahy was profiled on the TG4 television programme Laochra Gael.http://www.anfearrua.com/story.asp?id=1579 Playing career=Club= Leahy played his club hurling and football with his local Mullinahone club. He enjoyed much success winning county medals in both codes at underage levels. By the time Leahy's club career was coming to an end Mullinahone had been promoted to the senior grade. In 2002 he battled back from a cruciate ligament injury to be appointed player-manager of the club's senior hurling side. That year he guided Mullinahone to their first senior county championship.http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/kelly-underlines- his-class-in-mullinahones-fairytale-win-285136.html =Minor & under-21= Leahy's hurling skills quickly came to the attention of the Tipperary inter- county selectors and he joined the minor panel in 1987. In 1987 he won a Munster minor medal and joined the Senior Hurling and U21 Teams in 1988. In 1989 Leahy won a Munster title with the under-21 team before later converting this into an All-Ireland medal. In 1990 he won a second Munster under-21 medal. That year he was the first Mullinahone man to Captain a Tipperary Side to a Munster Hurling Title. =Senior Hurling = In 1988 Leahy made his senior inter-county debut in a National Hurling League game against Antrim. In doing so he became the first Mullinahone man ever to play for the senior side. Tipp later went on to win the league title, with Leahy coming on as a substitute in the final. Later that year he came on as a substitute in the Munster final to claim his first senior provincial medal. Tipperary later lost the All-Ireland final to Galway. In 1989 Leahy was a full member of the Tipperary team and he captured a second consecutive Munster medal. This was later converted into his first senior All-Ireland medal following a final victory over Antrim. Two years later in 1991 Leahy captured a third provincial medal before later winning his second All-Ireland medal following a win over Kilkenny. His performance throughout the whole championship earned Leahy his first All-Star award. In 1993 he won his fourth Munster medal, however, Tipperary were later beaten by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Leahy won a second National League medal before adding a second All-Star award to his collection at the end of 1994. Leahy has a unique record of the only player to win an all-Star without playing in the championship in 1994. Three years later in 1997 Tipperary lost to Clare in the Munster final. In the first year of the 'back-door system', however, Tipp later qualified to play Clare again in the first-ever All-Munster All-Ireland final. Unfortunately Leahy ended up on the losing side once again. In spite of this he was presented with a third All- Star award. In 1999 Leahy won his third National League medal, however, further championship success still eluded Tipp. All this changed in 2001 when Tipp began the year by winning another league title. Injuring his right cruciate ligamenthttp://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2001/0607/sport/hurling- john-leahys-career-in-doubt-14878.html in the first round of the championship ruled Leahy out of both the Munster and All-Ireland finals, which Tipperary won.

Regarded as one of his county's greatest hurling servants, Ryan joined the team during the 1988 championship and was a regular member of the team until his retirement after the 2001 championship. During that time he won three All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals and four National Hurling League medals. He has ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. He is the father of two male kids, named, Jack and Tommy At club level Ryan is a two-time county club championship medalist with Clonoulty-Rossmore. In retirement from playing Ryan became involved in team management. He guided the Tipperary minor hurling team to a second consecutive All-Ireland title in 2007 before later winning back-to-back Munster titles with the Tipperary senior hurling team. An All-Ireland title eluded the team and Ryan stepped down as manager after two years in September 2012. Playing career=Club= Ryan played his club hurling with the Clonoulty-Rossmore club and enjoyed much success in a career that spanned three decades. After coming to prominence as an under-age player Ryan later established himself on the club's senior team. In 1989 Clonoulty-Rossmore qualified for the final of county senior championship for the first time in 101 years. Reigning champions Loughmore- Castleiney provided the opposition on that occasion, however, history was on the side of Ryan and his club. A narrow 1‚Äì-11 to 1‚Äì9 score line gave Clonoulty-Rossmore a county title. It was 1997 before Ryan lined out in his second county championship decider. Mullinahone were the opposition on that occasion, however, Clonoulty proved too strong once again. A 0‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì12 score line gave Ryan a second county title to add to his collection. In 1998 Clonoulty-Rossmore were given the opportunity to make history by retaining their championship title when the club qualified for the county final once again. Toomevara were the opponents on that occasion and a close game developed. A 0‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì10 score line resulted in defeat for Ryan's side. =Minor and under-21= Ryan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as dual player with the Tipperary minor teams in the mid-1980s. In 1986 his inter-county career nearly ended before it began in a Munster minor hurling championship game against Cork. Ryan, while lying on the ground, was struck in the face by a wild pull and received multiple stitches. It was as a member of the Tipperary under-21 hurling team that Ryan enjoyed his first major success. In 1989 he was captain of the team that defeated Limerick by 5‚àí16 to 1‚àí16 to take the Munster titlel. Tipperary later had a 4‚àí10 to 3‚àí11 victory over Offaly to take the All-Ireland title. =Senior= By this stage Ryan was already a key feature on the Tipperary senior panel. He made his debut in 1988 at a time when Tipperary's star was rising. The year began well for Ryan as he captured a National Hurling League winners' medal following a 3‚àí15 to 2‚àí9 defeat of Offaly. He later captured his first Munster winners' medal at senior level following a 2‚àí19 to 1‚àí13 victory over Cork. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Tipperary against reigning champions Galway. A 1‚àí15 to 0‚àí14 score line resulted in victory for Galway and defeat for Ryan. In spite of this disappointment he finished off his debut season by receiving his first All-Star award. In 1989 Tipperary were still the best team in Munster and Ryan won his second provincial title in-a-row after a 0‚àí26 to 2‚àí8 trouncing of Waterford. The All-Ireland final saw Tipperary face surprise semi-final winners Antrim. It was an historic occasion as it was only the second appearance of an Ulster team in the championship decider. Antrim‚Äôs relative inexperience robbed the final of any real element of contest and Tipp romped home to a 4‚àí24 to 3‚àí9 win, courtesy of a star performance by Nicky English. Because of this Tipp preserved their record of being the only team to win an All-Ireland title in every decade in GAA history. It was Ryan's first senior All-Ireland winners' medal. After surrendering their provincial and All-Ireland titles in 1990, Tipp returned the following year to defeat Cork in a thrilling Munster final replay. It was Ryan's third provincial winners' medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Tipp take on Kilkenny for the first time in twenty years. A freak goal by Michael Cleary in the first-half gave Tipp a lead which they never surrendered. A 1‚àí16 to 0‚àí15 victory allowed Ryan to capture his second All-Ireland winners' medal in three years. 1992 saw Tipp exit the championship at an early stage, however, the team bounced back for one last hurrah in 1993. That year Ryan added a fourth Munster winners' medal to his collection as Tipp trounced Clare by 3‚àí27 to 2‚àí12. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Tipp renew their rivalry with Galway; however, on this occasion Galway took the spoils. This defeat brought the curtain down on Tipp‚Äôs great revival, however, Ryan did collect a second National League title in 1994. The next few years saw Limerick and Clare dominate the provincial series of games. After defeat after a draw and a replay in the Munster final of 1996, Ryan lined out in the provincial decider again in 1997. Clare provided the opposition on that occasion, however, it was an occasion to forget for Ryan as Tipp lost a close and exciting game by 1‚àí18 to 0‚àí18. The introduction of the new 'back-door' system resulted in both Clare and Tipperary meeting for the second time in the first all-Munster All-Ireland final. The game itself was one of the best of the decade. Clare were well on top for much of the game, however, Liam Cahill and Eugene O'Neill scored twice for Tipp in the last ten minutes. John Leahy missed a goal chance in the last minute while another Tipp point was controversially ruled wide. At the full- time whistle Clare had won by a single point by 0‚àí20 to 2‚àí13. Ryan added a third National League medal to his collection in 1999; however, further success in the championship still eluded him with provincial final defeat again in 2000. In 2001 Tipp made a third consecutive appearance in the National League final. After one victory and one defeat Ryan's side were successful again and defeated Clare by 1‚àí19 to 0‚àí17. It was Ryan's fourth and final winners' medal in that competition. Later in the championship Tipp defeated Limerick by 2‚àí16 to 1‚àí17, giving Ryan a fifth Munster winners' medal. After a draw and a replay against Wexford Ryan later lined out in Croke Park in a fifth All-Ireland final. Old rivals Galway provided the opposition on that occasion; however, two goals by Tipp‚Äôs Mark O'Leary gave the Munster men the threshold to withstand a Galway comeback. With nine minutes to go Ryan's side only led by one point, however, Tipperary outscored Galway by five to three in those closing minutes. At the final whistle Tipperary were the winners by 2‚àí18 to 2‚àí15. Not only did Ryan collect his third All-Ireland winners' medal but he also joined an exclusive club of players to have won championship titles in three separate decades. Following this victory he retired from inter-county hurling. =Inter-provincial= Ryan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He won his sole Railway Cup medal in 1996 following a 2‚àí20 to 0‚àí10 trouncing of Leinster. Management career=Tipperary minor hurling manager= In October 2006 Ryan took over from Liam Sheedy as manager of the Tipperary Minor hurling team. In his first year in charge Tipperary won the Munster Minor Hurling Championship with a 0‚àí18 to 1‚àí11 win against Cork in the final. Tipperary went all the way to the All Ireland minor final after a 1‚àí19 to 2‚àí12 win against Kilkenny in the semi final, which was followed by a 3‚àí14 to 2‚àí11 win again against Cork in the final. In 2008, Tipperary reached the Munster final against Cork but were defeated by 0‚àí19 to 0‚àí18. They went on to reach the All Ireland Minor semi final where they lost to Kilkenny by 1‚àí14 to 3‚àí17. Ryan was succeeded as Minor hurling manager by Mark O'Leary in 2009. =Tipperary senior hurling manager= On 9 November 2010, Ryan was appointed as the Tipperary Senior hurling manager on a two-year term, succeeding Liam Sheedy. He will be joined by Tommy Dunne as the new team coach, with Michael Gleeson of Tipperary county champions Thurles Sarsfields completing the new Tipperary hurling management team. Ryan's first game in charge was in January 2011 in the 2011 Waterford Crystal Cup against WIT where Tipperary were defeated by a scoreline of 2‚àí17 to 1‚àí19 in Clonmel. His first league game in charge took place on 12 February 2011 against Kilkenny, in a 1-10 to 1-17 defeat at Semple Stadium. His first league win came in the third round on 5 March 2011 against Waterford by 1-20 to 0-18 under the floodlights at Semple Stadium. On 29 May 2011 in Ryan's first Championship game as manager, Tipperary defeated Cork by 3‚àí22 to 0‚àí23 at Semple Stadium. On 10 July 2011, in his first Munster Final as manager, Tipperary defeated Waterford by 7-19 to 0-19 at P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. Ryan guided Tipperary past Dublin in the semi-final to meet Kilkenny in the 2011 All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final where they were defeated by 2‚àí17 to 1‚àí16. In March 2012, Ryan managed Tipperary to their first trophy of the year by winning the Waterford Crystal Cup against Clare in Sixmilebridge by 1‚àí21 to 2‚àí12. In July 2012, Tipperary retained the Munster title with a 2‚àí17 to 0‚àí16 win against Waterford in the Final.

Academic study Within academia, The Act of Marriage is viewed as an interesting insight into the ever changing relationship between mainstream religion and sexual practice. Michigan State Professor, Amy DeRogatis, took a deep look at this book and others of the sort to explore the impacts they have on gender roles within Protestant Evangelical tradition. While it pushes the boundaries of accepted sexual practice within Evangelical heterosexual marriage to that point, it upholds a strictly complementarian view of gender. At some points within the text it describes men as \\"beasts\\" and \\"uncontrollable\\" in the context of sexual desire, while it paints women as pleasers and far less sexual than their husbands.LaHaye, Tim, and Beverly LaHaye.

It was originally designed as a silent movie theater by C. Howard Crane and opened its doors on April 1, 1921, with a capacity of more than 3,000 seats. The first show was of the movie Her Greatest Love, and featured Phil Spitalny and his 35 piece orchestra as live performers. The theater was designed in the Italian Renaissance style and was one of the few \\"daylight atmospheric\\" theaters in the country, with a ceiling painted to resemble the open daylight sky. In the lobby, a rotunda was built to resemble the Villa Madama in Rome. The ceiling of the rotunda was decorated with Renaissance-style figures from an unknown artist's imagination which greeted cinema patrons for decades. By the mid-1960s, financial troubles plagued both the Allen and the other downtown theaters. These were primarily caused by the popularity of television and the growing desire for local residents to move away from the city and into the suburbs. On May 7, 1968, the Allen Theatre was closed; it remained vacant for nearly 30 years. The Playhouse Square Association was formed in 1970, and began the revitalization process of the Connor Palace, State and Ohio Theatres; but the Allen remained closed and slated for possible demolition until 1993, when the Playhouse Square Foundation agreed to purchase it. Fully restored to its former glory, the Allen Theatre reopened on October 3, 1998, with 2,500 seats and became an important venue for hosting touring Broadway musicals and concerts. In 2000, the Cleveland Ballet, which had been performing in the State Theatre, left the city and moved to San Jose, California. This enabled the State Theatre to produce more Broadway shows; but bookings for the Allen Theatre declined. Playhouse Square began to pursue alternative uses for the Allen Theatre, and eventually found it with two nearby organizations: Cleveland Play House and Cleveland State University. Through a collaboration called \\"The Power of Three,\\" Cleveland Play House, Cleveland State University and Playhouse Square partnered and launched a $32 million renovation project to create the Allen Theatre Complex. The theater itself was closed in 2010, underwent a major transformation, and re-opened on September 16, 2011. The house was reduced from seating 2,500 people to just under 500, creating a much more intimate theatrical setting. Large golden panels were installed along the walls of the theater to improve acoustics; in such a way that they could be taken down again, if desired, to reveal the original artwork still decorating the theater. In addition, two new theater spaces were built as a result of the collaboration. The Outcalt Theatre (originally Second Stage) was constructed as a flexible performance space with multiple configuration possibilities and maximum seating of around 300. The Helen Rosenfeld Lewis Bialosky Lab Theatre, seating approximately 100 people, was also built as a black box theater to house the Case Western Reserve University/Cleveland Play House MFA Acting Program and other events throughout the year.

It is one of the original five venues built in the district, opening on March 28, 1921. The Hanna Theatre reopened in 2008 as the new home of Great Lakes Theater Festival after a major renovation by the classic theater company. Original structure The Hanna Theatre was envisioned by industrialist and publisher Daniel Rhodes Hanna as part of a larger complex in memorial to his father, late U.S. Senator Mark A. Hanna, and was designed by architect Charles A. Platt. Faustinno Sampietro was responsible for most of the interior decorations, which included green and gold carpets, dark green seats, frescoed walls, a fireplace, and Louis XVI gilt furniture; the ceiling was coffered and was made up of circular and octagonal medallions, each of which contained gilded classical figures (including Cupid, Psyche, and Pegasus). The orchestra level consisted of 827 seats arranged in 24 rows, and the upper deck held 570 seats. Four rows in the mezzanine, ten rows in the upper balcony, and the box seats brought the theatre's full capacity to 1,421. The stage was forty feet in width and forty feet in depth, equipped with a thirty-six foot proscenium arch. Some idiosyncrasies exist in the layout: Dan Hanna insisted he wanted more room in between the fourth and fifth rows when he tested out a seat he meant to reserve for himself, and as a result there remained thirty-five inches in between these two rows instead of the standard thirty-one inches. Theatre hosting the taping of Washington Week during the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland  Opening  On March 28, 1921, 1,500 people ventured out into the freezing cold temperatures to witness the new theatre's first production, William Faversham's adaptation of The Prince and the Pauper by Mark Twain. The lobby measured a little over twenty feet in each direction and was nothing in the way of spectacle compared to the State and Ohio Theatres, both of which had opened the previous month. At exactly 8:15 Cleveland orchestra director Max Faetkenheuer opened the show with the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" and the play began. During intermission, playwright Faversham gave an impromptu speech at the request of the theatre patrons. = Hanna Theatre's first season = The following is a list of productions that ran at the Hanna Theatre beginning in the spring of 1921: *The Prince and the Pauper adaptation by William Faversham *The Passing Show of 1919 by the Shubert Brothers *Smilin' Through by Allan Langdon Martin *Jim Jam by the Shubert Brothers *Pitter Patter by the Shubert Brothers *The Masquerader by John Hunter Booth *Midnight Rounders by the Shubert Brothers *Up in the Haymow by James Avery Hopwood *Fools Errant by Louis Evan Shipman The most expensive seats cost three dollars.  Theatre rivalry  Program cover from a 1936 show at the theatre When Dan R. Hanna died three months into the Hanna Theatre's first full season, the Shubert brothers (Sam, Lee, and J.J. Shubert) remained as lessees under the management of John S. Hale. Around the corner, the brother's biggest rival, Abraham Lincoln Erlanger, continued to lease the Hanna's largest competition, the Ohio Theatre. Under the management of Robert H. McLaughlin, a former newspaperman and press agent, the Ohio Theatre had already built a distinguished repertoire of high class theatre. The Hanna Theatre could not always stand up to such an impressive lineup (including plays such as The Merry Wives of Windsor, Lady, Be Good, and Strange Interlude) and often suffered for it.  Ray Shepardson's vision  The Hanna Theatre closed in 1989, and soon after, Ray Shepardson left his job in the Cleveland public school system to launch a campaign to prevent the closed theater of Playhouse Square from being destroyed. His new vision for the Hanna was based on the concept of a cabaret theatre, which proved successful enough to generate funding by the Junior League and the Cleveland Foundation. By 1993 Ray Shepardson was nationally recognized as a theatre restoration expert, although he was not able to revive interest in the Hanna. The $38 million restoration drive he led mainly helped the larger Playhouse Square theatres, such as the State Theatre, thrive. For the brief time the Hanna did run as a cabaret theater, the interior was refurbished to meet the new needs. Tables and chairs replaced the usual theatre rows, although Shepardson insisted on preserving the theater's original, ornate d√©cor.  Restoration  Gwen Ifill after filming an episode of Washington Week at the Hanna Theatre during the 2016 Republican National Convention The Hanna Theatre was fully restored and reopened in 2008 with the following changes: # Six styles of seating: regular house seating, private box, banquette, club, lounge, and bar; reduction to 550 person capacity # Multiple ticket-price points for each performance ($20 for lounge area and up to $60 for premium seats) # A three-part hydraulic thrust stage that can lower to create a traditional proscenium stage with a full orchestra pit # A computer controlled mechanical fly system structurally independent of the building to handle more weight, intended to raise and lower scenery # Renovated street-level entrance with a door from the balcony level to an elevator lobby in the Hanna Annex building to allow patrons covered access to a parking garage, and balcony access for disabled patrons # Registration with the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System, in pursuit of a Silver rating, the third-highest rank The $14.7 million renovation was meant to rejuvenate the house space and create a comfortable atmosphere for theatre patrons. The Hanna Theatre was the last Playhouse Square theater renovated, a process that began in 1981. Great Lakes Theater producing artistic director Charles Fee and director Bob Taylor were behind the designs for the new theater. The renovated Hanna Theatre opened on September 20, 2008.

It is a fancy portrait depicting Jonathan Swift's close friend and correspondent Esther Vanhomrigh (1688-1723), who was known by that nickname, which Swift himself invented for her. Vanessa represents a major departure in Millais's art because he abandons fully for the first time the detailed finish that was still to be seen in Waking and Sleeping, exhibited in the previous year. Influenced by the work of Diego Vel√°zquez and Joshua Reynolds, Millais paints with dramatic, visible brush strokes in vivid colours, creating what has been described as an \\"almost violently modern\\" handling of paint.Kidson, A., Sudley: The Emma Holt Bequest, Liverpool: National Museums and Galleries of Merseyside, p. 33. Esther Vanhomrigh is known as \\"Swift's Vanessa\\" because of the fictional name he gave her when he published their correspondence. The portrait is wholly imaginary. No image of Esther Vanhomrigh survives and we know very little about her actual appearance, although she was said \\"not to be a beauty\\". She is holding a letter, presumably written to or from Swift. Her sad expression is related to the fraught nature of the relationship, which was broken up by Swift's relationship with another woman, Esther Johnson, whom he called \\"Stella\\", whom he may have married secretly. Vanessa died soon afterwards from tuberculosis. Millais also painted a companion piece depicting Stella. The painting is part of the 18th century revival in British art at this time, when a renewed interest in the brushwork of Reynolds and Gainsborough was emerging.

In the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final Galway put an end to Tipp's dream season with a 3‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì17 defeat. 1988 began well for Bonnar as he added a National Hurling League medal to his collection. He later captured his second Munster medal following another victory over Cork. A subsequent defeat of Antrim allowed Tipp to advance to the All-Ireland final where Galway provided the opposition. With an extra year's experience it was expected that Tipp might shade the victory. Galway, however, used this to motivate themselves. Noel Lane scored the crucial goal for Galway while Nicky English sent a late penalty over the bar for a point. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì14 score line resulted in victory for Galway and defeat for Bonnar.The GAA Book of Lists p. 362 In 1989 Tipperary were still the best team in Munster and Bonnar won his third provincial title in-a-row after a 0‚Äì26 to 2‚Äì8 trouncing of Waterford. For the third time in as many years Tipp faced Galway in the All-Ireland series, however, on this occasion the men from the West were without their star player Tony Keady. The game turned out to be a tense and unsavory affair as Tipp finally triumphed over Galway. Antrim, the surprise winners of the other semi-final, provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final. It was an historic occasion as it was only the second appearance of an Ulster team in the championship decider. Antrim's relative inexperience robbed the final of any real element of contest and Tipp romped home to a 4‚Äì24 to 3‚Äì9 win.The GAA Book of Lists p. 363 Because of this Tipp preserved their record of being the only team to win an All-Ireland title in every decade in GAA history. It was Bonnar's first senior All-Ireland medal. In 1990 Tipperary surrendered their Munster crown to Cork for the first time in four years. This defeat followed Babs Keating's infamous remark about Cork that 'donkeys don't win derbies'.Munster Hurling Legends p. 130 Tipp returned in 1991 and defeated Cork in a thrilling Munster final replay giving Bonnar his fourth provincial medal. The subsequent All- Ireland final saw Tipp take on Kilkenny for the first time in twenty years. A freak goal by Michael Cleary in the first-half gave Tipp a lead which they never surrendered. A 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì15 victory allowed Bonnar to capture his second All-Ireland medal in three years. 1992 saw Tipp exit the championship at an early stage, however, the team bounced back for one last hurrah in 1993. That year Bonnar added a fifth Munster medal to his collection as Tipp trounced Clare by 3‚Äì27 to 2‚Äì12. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Tipp renew their rivalry with Galway; however, on this occasion Galway took the spoils. This defeat brought the curtain down on Tipp's great revival. After defeat after a draw and a replay in the Munster final of 1996, Bonnar lined out in a second consecutive provincial decider in 1997. Clare provided the opposition on that occasion, however, it was an occasion to foregt for Bonnar as Tipp lost a close and exciting game by 1‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì18.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 The introduction of the new 'back-door' system resulted in both Clare and Tipperary meeting for the second time in the first all-Munster All- Ireland final. The game itself was one of the best of the decade. Clare were well on top for much of the game, however, Liam Cahill and Eugene O'Neill scored twice for Tipp in the last ten minutes. John Leahy missed a goal chance in the last minute while another Tipp point was controversially ruled wide. At the full-time whistle Clare won by a single point ‚Äì 0‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì13.The GAA Book of Lists p. 365 Following defeat in the 1998 provincial championship Bonnar decided to retire from inter-county hurling. Managerial career=Waterford= On 13 September 1999, Bonnar joined the Waterford senior hurling team's five-man selection committee under Gerald McCarthy. His first season as selector and assistant coach saw Waterford finish in second place in Division 1B after the group stage of the National League. Waterford exited the league on 30 April 2000 following a 2-15 to 1-15 defeat by Galway at the semi- final stage. On 28 May, Waterford's season came to an end following a 0-17 to 0-14 defeat by Tipperary in the Munster Championship. Bonnar's second season as a selector saw Waterford enjoy an indifferent National League campaign. His side failed to make it to the knock-out stage after losing three games and finishing in fifth position in the group table. Waterford's championship campaign ended on 10 June following a 4-11 to 2-14 defeat by Limerick. Gerald McCarthy stepped down as manager following this defeat and was replaced by Justin McCarthy. Bonnar was retained as part of the new management team. Waterford had a mid-table finish in Division 1A of the 2002 National League and failed to make the knock-out stages for the second year in succession. On 30 June, Waterford defeated Tipperary by 2-23 to 3-12 to win the Munster Championship for the first time in 39 years. Bonnar had mixed emotions following the defeat of his native county: \\"I was over the moon for Waterford but I wasn't as caught up in it. I knew what the Tipp lads were going through. I could not race on to the field or jump around...I was proud to be part of that team but those 15 minutes after the match, it was a strange place to be.\\" Bonnar's fourth and final season with Waterford saw the team fail to make the knock-out stage of the National League for the third year in succession. On 29 June 2003, Waterford reached a second successive Munster final, however, Cork were the eventual winners by 3-16 to 3-12. Bonnar stepped down from the management team following Waterford's exit from the championship. =Wexford= Bonnar was confirmed as manager of the Wexford senior hurling team, in succession to John Meyler, on 11 November 2008. His team was knocked out of the Leinster Championship at the semi-final stage by Dublin, and lost to Limerick in the qualifiers, leaving them in a situation where they had to play a relegation play-off against Antrim. Bonnar was unhappy about the possibility that his team could potentially play in Christy Ring Cup rather than the All Ireland Series in 2010. He and the managers of the other teams involved in the play-offs appealed to the GAA's Disputes Resolution Authority, who took the decision to postpone the relegation final until a future date. The Director General of the GAA has suggested that the relegation final will be played, but that no team would end up being relegated and that a decision would be made on the issue in early October 2009. In July 2011 he resigned as manager of Wexford after the defeat to Limerick. =Carlow=2017 season On 30 August 2016, Bonnar was ratified as manager of the Carlow senior hurling team. In the early stages of his first season in charge, he admitted to being impressed with the attitude of the players: \\"‚ÄúWithout the players we don't have anything. They have created the right values and standards about what we are trying to achieve. They have a big part to play in it, they have all bought into it, we are delighted with that, and I'm really enjoying it.‚Äù Bonnar's side enjoyed some good form in the National League and remained undefeated in Division 2A. On 31 March 2017, Carlow suffered a 2-12 to 0-15 defeat by Antrim in the Division 2A final. On 22 April 2017, Bonnar's side suffered a 3-20 to 2-22 defeat by Antrim in their opening game of the Christy Ring Cup. In spite of this, Carlow qualified for the final on 10 June. For the fourth time in as many months, Antrim provided the opposition, however, Bonnar's side claimed the title with a 5-23 to 4-15 victory. 2018 season Bonnar's side opened their 2018 National League campaign with a 0-19 to 0-15 defeat by Westmeath on 28 January 2018. Carlow won their remaining group stage games and qualified for the final on 24 March. Bonnar's side defeated Westmeath by 2-19 to 2-12 and secured promotion. A restructuring of the various hurling tiers saw Carlow added to the new Joe McDonagh Cup for the 2018 season. Bonnar's side topped the group after suffering just one defeat in their five games. On 1 July, Carlow won the title and promotion to the Leinster Championship following a 2-26 to 1-24 defeat of Westmeath in the final. 2019 season Bonnar's side failed to secure a win in Division 1B, however, Carlow managed draws with Galway and Laois. On 10 March, Carlow retained their Division 1B status for 2020 after a 2-14 to 1-16 play-off victory over Offaly.

Nonetheless, this legal document includes in its Preamble other legal denominations that portray the history and nature of the territory: Regne de Val√®ncia (\\"Kingdom of Valencia\\") and Pa√≠s Valenci√† (\\"Valencian Country\\" or \\"Land of Valencia\\"). Denominations Over the years, there have been several denominations both in Spanish and Valencian covering what today is the Valencian Community. The topic stems from the potentially ambiguous usage of Valencia, which may designate the city of Valencia, the Valencia province or the whole territory of the Valencian Community. =Kingdom of Valencia= Map of the Kingdom of Valencia in the sixteenth century \\"Kingdom of Valencia\\" refers to the conquered territory by the Christian Catalan and Aragonese troops commanded by king James I in 1238. The conquered territory was granted wide administrative, legal and political self- government within the structure of the Crown of Aragon as stipulated in the set of laws known first as Costums de Valencia. When these were transformed into the Furs of Valencia (Charters of Valencia), the autonomy was extended to all the Valencian territory. The furs (code of law), its administrative and legal structure, as well as its status as an autonomous political entity were dissolved in 1707, at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession by Philip V of Spain, with the promulgation of the Nueva Planta decrees, whereby the legislation and structure of the Kingdom of Castile were instituted in the territory. Nevertheless, the Kingdom of Valencia denomination continued to be used locally during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, an example of which were the government divisions or Javier de Burgos's provincial division proposal. However, it was sometimes rendered as Antic Regne de Valencia (\\"Old Kingdom of Valencia\\") to clarify the non-existence of the kingdom as a legal or political entity. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the term was confined to the academic, cultural or literary domains, especially after the Valencian Renaixen√ßa and the nascent Valencian nationalism, which began to use the term along with Pa√≠s Valenci√†. During Franco's dictatorship the term was in disuse, only to be revived during the political transition toward democracy in Spain, concurrent with the transition towards Valencian autonomy, at the beginning of the 1980s, as well as by blaverism, which used it in opposition to the denomination Pa√≠s Valenci√†, adopted by the left-wing organizations. Nowadays, the term \\"Kingdom of Valencia\\" is only used in the cultural or academic realms, even though it is included in the Preamble of the current Valencian Statute of Autonomy, as well as in its first article, in order to evocate the historical origin of what today constitutes the Valencian Community. = Valencian Country or Land of Valencia = Pa√≠s Valenci√† (rendered as \\"Valencian Country\\",Moll√†, Toni (1998). \\"A catalans Language and linguistic community in the Valencian Country\\" Di√†legs: revista d'estudis pol√≠tics i socials Vol. 1, N¬∫. 2, 1998 , pags. 33-45 \\"Valencian Region\\",Geffner-Sclarsky (2006). \\"Hospital care for stroke patients in the Valencian Region using the basic minimum data set from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification\\".

Valencian linguist and historian Manuel Sanchis i Guarner reports other instances of the term since the 18th century in his work La llengua dels valencians.Summary of the work of La llengua dels valencians. Sanchis Guarner informs the existence of a Valencian satirical document titled in Catalan as follows: \\"Carta no vista, lletra uberta, combit cheneral i particular, que fa Quelo el Roig d'Albal, n√©t de la tia Rafela, a tota la Cort de Madrit, per que vinga a veurer o mirar la gran Festa Centenar de la Verche Protectora, ulatant el lluit que estar√† el Pa√≠s Valenci√†\\". Translated: \\"Letter, not seen, open words, a general and particular invitation made by Quelo the Red of Albal, grandson of aunt Rarela, to all the Court of Madrid, to come and see or watch the Great Centennial Feast to the Protector Virgin, proving how splendid the Valencian Country will be\\". In these early usages, the term designated a merely geographic concept. Then, by the early twentieth century, Labor and Valencian nationalist movements picked up the term and gave it the modern cultural and political connotation. For example, the Joventuts Valencianistes (Valencianist Youth), in 1906 published a map of the comarques using this particular denomination. The term became popular during the 1930s, and was widely used in academic, cultural and political papers and publications, most notably the Quaderns d'Orientaci√≥ Valencianista journal, published by Editorial Estel, nowadays edited by the University of Valencia.Quaderns d'Orientaci√≥ Valencianista A prop√≤sit de Joan Fuster It had a noticeable official usage during the Second Spanish Republic, as it reflects, by example, the use of the term from the Provincial Council of Valencia (present Provincial Delegation) in a poster made by Artur Ballester i Marco.Cartel \\"El Pa√≠s Valenci√† a l'Avantguarda d'Ib√®ria.

External link Also a good sample of it can be seen its use in the different projects from statutes of autonomy of the CNT in 1936,s:Bases para el Estatuto de Autonom√≠a del Pa√≠s Valenciano (1936) of Valencian Lefts:Anteproyecto de Estatuto de Autonom√≠a de la Regi√≥n Valenciana (1937) and Izquierda Republicanas:Proyecto de Estatuto de Autonom√≠a para el Pa√≠s Valenciano (1937) in 1937.

Editorial Dest√≠, edici√≥ de 1962. . the term became widely used again (during the dictatorship), to the point of being the most widely used term to refer to the territory in the media, most notably in the regional newspapers of various political ideologies, without any overt censorship from Franco's government, despite it being most likely a term mimicking Pa√≠s Vasco (Basque Country), thus trying to emphasize the perceived (for this term's users) \\"othernesss\\" of the Valencian territory within Spain. When democracy was restored, the term was proposed in the Statute of Autonomy of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Valencian Country, on October 25, 1979. Before the ratification of the 1979 Statute of Autonomy, which coined the term \\"Valencian Community\\", the \\"Pre-autonomy Council of the Valencian Country\\" also used the term. Even though the term was widely used, especially by the Democratic Center Union party (UCD), in the 1980s, the local right-wing politicians rejected the term, since they considered that its use would imply a political link to the \\"Catalan Countries\\" (in Valencian: Pa√Øsos Catalans). The last mayor of the city of Valencia before democracy, Miguel Ram√≥n Izquierdo, justified the rejection of the term, since \\"pa√≠s es singular de pa√≠ses, entonces se habla de un Pa√≠s Valenciano dentro de los Pa√≠ses Catalanes\\" (\\"country is the singular of countries, hence we are talking about a Valencian Country within the Catalan Countries\\"). Nowadays, the term is still used, mostly in academia, encyclopedias in CatalanThe denomination Pa√≠s Valenci√† is the preferred term at the Grup Enciclop√®dia Catalana (and occasionally in Spanish)\\"El catal√°n occidental ocupa Andorra, la provincia de L√©rida [...] y el Pa√≠s Valenciano\\", in \\" _Catalana, lengua_ \\". Macropedia Volumen 4, Enciclopedia Hisp√°nica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Publishers, Inc., United States of America (1992-1993) in the names of streets, plazas and avenues, by some political parties (e.g. the United Left of the Valencian Country), labor unions (UGT-PV, CCOO-PV, etc.), and some nationalist-leaning media. The term may be even preferred to \\"Valencian Community\\" in some comarques, even though it is not the official denomination. The Partit Socialista del Pa√≠s Valenci√†, which is the local branch of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, currently the governing party at the regional parliament, keeps Pa√≠s Valenci√† in its name, but in its documents and public statements they use instead Comunitat Valenciana. Both the 1982 and the 2006 Statutes of Autonomy included the term in the Preamble. The current Statute of Autonomy states that the \\"Valencian tradition coming from the historic Kingdom of Valencia met with the modern conception of the Valencian Country and produced the Valencian autonomy\\".Preamble of the Statute of Autonomy of the Valencian Community \\"Valencian Country\\" is one attempt at rendering the term Pa√≠s Valenci√† in English. Another rendition in English, also locally created, is \\"Land of Valencia\\". This appeared in Valencian tourist department advertisingLand of Valencia and, since then, has been used by some other travel publications in English.Valencia and The Costa Blanca, by Miles Roddis. Published 2002 by Lonely Planet. . It is unclear whether the original term translated is Region Valenciana or Pa√≠s Valenci√†. =Valencian Region and Levante= \\"Valencian Region\\" (in Valencian: Regi√≥ Valenciana) was a denomination that became majoritary during Franco's dictatorship, with the intention of emphasizing the intended nature of the territory under the political structure of the time: a region within Spain. In fact, before the twentieth century, several territories dominated by Spain were called \\"kingdoms\\", as a synonym of \\"country\\", in spite of the fact that they were not monarchies. From the nineteenth century onwards, the term \\"kingdom\\" began to be substituted by the term \\"region\\", especially in books which imitated the French regional geographical nomenclature. In that sense, \\"region\\" designated any state, country or nation (all previously used terms that designated the diverse territories of the Spanish Empire or under the king of Spain), regardless of their political and administrative nature of the territory, whereas \\"kingdom\\" was reserved to the particular State, country or nation governed by a monarch. Today, the concept of \\"region\\" does not refer to a particular political entity, but alludes to regional geography. Within the dictatorship, the term had a centralizing connotation and not simply a geographical meaning. One more term which gained wide acceptance during the Francoist times was Levante, which roughly translates as \\"East\\", in a similar fashion to Levant in French. In Spanish, levante (llevant in Valencian) are easterly winds and, geographically speaking, anything coming from or originating in the east, such as the eastern slopes of a range (the western ones are called '). In its attempt to homogenize the Spanish territory, the Francoist governments and media often used Levante to refer to the eastern Mediterranean coast of Spain. Since Catalonia had a well defined identity already, Levante came to designate, roughly, the territories which used to make the Kingdom of Valencia and, often, additionally the Regi√≥n de Murcia. Since by population and extension, the Valencian Community is quite larger than the Regi√≥n de Murcia, for some this term was narrowed to vaguely designate what today is the Valencian Community. The term may still be heard today, mainly informally, designating for example motorways names such as in Autov√≠a de Levante. It remains in use also within private organizations such as companies, chiefly to designate a sales territory. Some public organizations such as the trade union CNT-FAI also use it for their territorial organization.CNT - Directorio de Sindicatos - Levante Also, the oldest newspaper in the Valencian Community, edited in the city of Valencia is called Levante-El Mercantil Valenciano. The football team Levante UD, from the city of Valencia and currently in the Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n is also named in this fashion, even despite its name has origin in the Levante Beach (now ). =Valencian Community= 20px 20px 20px 20px The term which has become official, \\"Valencian Community\\" (Comunitat Valenciana), was first used within the articles of the proposal of the Statute of Autonomy drafted by the Parliamentary Assembly in charge of forging the Statute, interchangeably with the term Pa√≠s Valenci√†. In this proposal, known as the Agreement of Benic√†ssim (Acord de Benic√†ssim), both the left-wing and right-wing parties reached a consensus regarding the symbols of the territory and soon-to-be autonomous community of Spain. The left-wing parties accepted as the flag of Valencia a senyera including a blue strip and the coat of arms of the generalitat, and the right-wing parties accepted the term Pa√≠s Valenci√† in the statute's preamble. Nonetheless, when this proposal was presented before the Chamber of Deputies of Spain, consensus was broken; UCD did not comply with the Agreement of Benic√†ssim, and proposed to change the flag to include the crown in the blue strip, i.e., to use the flag of the city of Valencia as the flag of the whole territory, they also moved back to retain the term Regne de Valencia (\\"Kingdom of Valencia\\"). Given that center and right-wing political parties formed an absolute majority in the Congress, the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), reached a compromise with the UCD (by the proposal of deputy Emilio Attard), through which the term Regne de Valencia was replaced by Comunidad Valenciana (\\"Valencian Community\\", \\"community\\" as in \\"autonomous community\\") within the articles of the legal text, and the terms Regne de Valencia and Pa√≠s Valenci√† were included only as incidental mentions in the Preamble, so that whichever party was in power in a particular time would use whichever denomination it preferred. Later on, by the mid and late 1980s, when the PSOE won absolute majorities both in the Spanish Parliament and the Valencian one, it decided to keep the existing solution unchanged rather than reopening the topic, which had been harshly fought over. The same stance has been followed by the PP. It has been under the latter's ruling that the name has been officially made Comunitat Valenciana (in Valencian), rather than the previous bilingual Spanish/Valencian (Comunidad/Comunitat Valenciana).

He utilized an educational method that focused on discovering answers by asking questions from his students. According to Plato, who was one of his students, Socrates believed that \\"the disciplined practice of thoughtful questioning enables the scholar/student to examine ideas and be able to determine the validity of those ideas\\" . Plato described this rigorous method of teaching to explain that the teacher assumes an ignorant mindset in order to compel the student to assume the highest level of knowledge . Thus, a student has the ability to acknowledge contradictions, recreate inaccurate or unfinished ideas and critically determine necessary thought. Socratic questioning is a form of disciplined questioning that can be used to pursue thought in many directions and for many purposes, including: to explore complex ideas, to get to the truth of things, to open up issues and problems, to uncover assumptions, to analyze concepts, to distinguish what we know from what we do not know, to follow out logical consequences of thought or to control discussions. Socratic questioning is based on the foundation that thinking has structured logic, and allows underlying thoughts to be questioned. The key to distinguishing Socratic questioning from questioning per se is that the former is systematic, disciplined, deep and usually focuses on fundamental concepts, principles, theories, issues or problems. Socratic questioning is referred to in teaching, and has gained currency as a concept in education, particularly in the past two decades. Teachers, students, or anyone interested in probing thinking at a deep level can construct Socratic questions and engage in them.Paul, R. and Elder, L. (2006). The Art of Socratic Questioning. Dillon Beach, CA: Foundation for Critical Thinking. Socratic questioning and its variants have also been extensively used in psychotherapy.  Pedagogy  When teachers use Socratic questioning in teaching, their purpose may be to probe student thinking, to determine the extent of student knowledge on a given topic, issue or subject, to model Socratic questioning for students or to help students analyze a concept or line of reasoning. It is suggested that students should learn the discipline of Socratic questioning so that they begin to use it in reasoning through complex issues, in understanding and assessing the thinking of others and in following-out the implications of what they and others think. In fact, Socrates himself thought that questioning was the only defensible form of teaching. In teaching, teachers can use Socratic questioning for at least two purposes: * To deeply probe student thinking, to help students begin to distinguish what they know or understand from what they do not know or understand (and to help them develop intellectual humility in the process). * To foster students' abilities to ask Socratic questions, to help students acquire the powerful tools of Socratic dialogue, so that they can use these tools in everyday life (in questioning themselves and others). To this end, teachers can model the questioning strategies they want students to emulate and employ. Moreover, teachers need to directly teach students how to construct and ask deep questions. Beyond that, students need practice to improve their questioning abilities. Socratic questioning illuminates the importance of questioning in learning. This includes differentiating between systematic and fragmented thinking, while forcing individuals to understand the root of their knowledge and ideas. Educators who support the use of Socratic Questioning in educational settings argue that it helps students become active and independent learners. Examples of Socratic questions that are used for students in educational settings: 'Outstanding Teaching'. UK. # Getting students to clarify their thinking and explore the origin of their thinking #: e.g., 'Why do you say that?', 'Could you explain further?' # Challenging students about assumptions #: e.g., 'Is this always the case?', 'Why do you think that this assumption holds here?' # Providing evidence as a basis for arguments #: e.g., 'Why do you say that?', 'Is there reason to doubt this evidence?' # Discovering alternative viewpoints and perspectives and conflicts between contentions #: e.g., 'What is the counter-argument?', 'Can/did anyone see this another way?' # Exploring implications and consequences #: e.g., 'But if...happened, what else would result?', 'How does...affect...?' # Questioning the question #: e.g., 'Why do you think that I asked that question?', 'Why was that question important?', 'Which of your questions turned out to be the most useful?'  Socratic questioning and critical thinking  The art of Socratic questioning is intimately connected with critical thinking because the art of questioning is important to excellence of thought. Socrates argued for the necessity of probing individual knowledge, and acknowledging what one may not know or understand. Critical thinking has the goal of reflective thinking that focuses on what should be believed or done about a topic. Socratic questioning adds another level of thought to critical thinking, by focusing on extracting depth, interest and assessing the truth or plausibility of thought. Socrates argued that a lack of knowledge is not bad, but students must strive to make known what they don't know through the means of a form of critical thinking. Critical thinking and Socratic questioning both seek meaning and truth. Critical thinking provides the rational tools to monitor, assess, and perhaps reconstitute or re-direct our thinking and action. This is what educational reformer John Dewey described as reflective inquiry: \\"in which the thinker turns a subject over in the mind, giving it serious and consecutive consideration.\\" Socratic questioning is an explicit focus on framing self-directed, disciplined questions to achieve that goal. The technique of questioning or leading discussion is spontaneous, exploratory, and issue-specific. The Socratic educator listens to the viewpoints of the student and considers the alternative points of view. It is necessary to teach students to sift through all the information, form a connection to prior knowledge, and transform the data to new knowledge in a thoughtful way. It has been proposed in different studies that the \\"level of thinking that occurs is influenced by the level of questions asked\\". Thus, utilizing the knowledge that students don't know stimulates their ability to ask more complex questions. This requires educators to create active learning environments that promote and value the role of critical thinking, mobilizing their ability to form complex thoughts and questions.  Psychology  Socratic questioning has also been used in psychotherapy, most notably as a cognitive restructuring technique in classical Adlerian psychotherapy, logotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and logic-based therapy. The purpose is to help uncover the assumptions and evidence that underpin people's thoughts in respect of problems. A set of Socratic questions in cognitive therapy aim to deal with automatic thoughts that distress the patient: # Revealing the issue: 'What evidence supports this idea? And what evidence is against its being true?' # Conceiving reasonable alternatives: 'What might be another explanation or viewpoint of the situation? Why else did it happen?' # Examining various potential consequences: 'What are worst, best, bearable and most realistic outcomes?' # Evaluate those consequences: 'What's the effect of thinking or believing this? What could be the effect of thinking differently and no longer holding onto this belief?' # Distancing: 'Imagine a specific friend/family member in the same situation or if they viewed the situation this way, what would I tell them?' Careful use of Socratic questioning enables a therapist to challenge recurring or isolated instances of a person's illogical thinking while maintaining an open position that respects the internal logic to even the most seemingly illogical thoughts.

Disaster and cleanup The Red Forest is located in the zone of alienation; this area received the highest doses of radiation from the Chernobyl accident and the resulting clouds of smoke and dust, heavily polluted with radioactive contamination. The trees died from this radiation. The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl No. 4 reactor contaminated the soil, water and atmosphere with radioactive material equivalent to that of 20 times the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the post-disaster cleanup operations, a majority of the pine trees were bulldozed and buried in trenches by the \\"liquidators\\". The trenches were then covered with a thick carpet of sand and planted with pine saplings.Mary Mycio, Wormwood Forest: A Natural History of Chernobyl, Many fear that as the trees decay, radioactive contaminants will leach into the ground water. People have evacuated the contaminated zone around the Red Forest. Wildlife refuge Map showing Caesium-137 contamination in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine as of 1996. As humans were evacuated from the area in 1986, animals moved in despite the radiation. The flora and fauna of the Red Forest have been dramatically affected by the accident. It seems that the biodiversity of the Red Forest has increased in the years following the disaster. There are reports of some stunted plants in the area. Wild boar multiplied eightfold between 1986 and 1988. The site of the Red Forest remains one of the most contaminated areas in the world. However, it has proved to be an astonishingly fertile habitat for many endangered species. The evacuation of the area surrounding the nuclear reactor has created a lush and unique wildlife refuge. In the 1996 BBC Horizon documentary \\"Inside Chernobyl's Sarcophagus\\", birds are seen flying in and out of large holes in the structure of the former nuclear reactor. The long-term impact of the fallout on the flora and fauna of the region is not fully known, as plants and animals have significantly different and varying radiologic tolerance. Some birds are reported with stunted tail feathers (which interferes with breeding). Storks, wolves, beavers, deer, and eagles have been reported in the area. Chernobyl: The True Scale of the Accident , by International Atomic Energy Agency/World Health Organization/United Nations Development Programme, 5 September 2005. Today, radiation levels in the Red Forest can be as high as one roentgen per hour, but levels of ten milliroentgens per hour are more common. More than 90% of the radioactivity of the Red Forest is concentrated in the soil. Scientists are planning to use the nearby radioactive and abandoned town of Pripyat, and surrounding area, as a unique laboratory for modelling the dispersal of radionuclides by the detonation of a dirty bomb or an attack with chemical or biological agents. The area offers an unparalleled opportunity to fully understand the passage of radioactive debris through an urban and rural area. The nature of the area seems to have not only survived, but flourished due to significant reduction of human impact. The zone has become a \\"Radiological Reserve\\", a classic example of an involuntary park. Currently, there is concern about contamination of the soil with strontium-90 and caesium-137, which have half- lives of about 30 years. The highest levels of caesium-137 are found in the surface layers of the soil where they are absorbed by plants, and insects living there today. Some scientists fear that radioactivity will affect the land for the next several generations. Wildfires In April 2015, a large forest fire burning nearly 400 hectares came within twenty kilometres of the abandoned nuclear power plant, raising fears the flames would burn shrub and woodland surrounding the disaster zone, which could have released radioactive material into the atmosphere. The forest was ravaged again by another wildfire in April 2020 that caused an unknown amount of damage.

National library of Nigeria at 30: its history and prospects for the future (1992?) History and organization The construction of the Library began in 1962 and the Library was finally opened in November 1964. The headquarters was moved from Lagos to Abuja ca. 1995. The Library Act enacted by the House of Representatives of Nigeria guaranteed financial assistance to the project, the Act also provided provisions for the training of staff and the creation of a board of directors made up of professionals. In concord with the demands of the Nigerian republic and the assembly, a group of 15 trained librarians were hired to provide a positive role in developing and manning the library. A board was inaugurated in April 1966 by a new military government. The board was made up of government officials instead of professionals as written on the original act. However, the board tried to improve on the original objectives of the library. But the Nigerian civil war hampered funding and formal government actions were not taken until 1970. In 1970, a new legal precedent was set with the creation of the National Library decree, the decree was partly enacted on the advice of the board which wanted to expand the library to other state capitals in order to create a network of repositories. Mission The Library is aided financially by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Originally, the Ford Foundation was involved with the project.Everts, Bart. ‚ÄúIndependent Reading? A History of the Nigerian National Library‚Äù Presentation at the Missouri Valley History Conference, Omaha,NE, March 6‚Äì8, 2014. The foundation brought in professionals, donated books and funded the library's expansion. The Library over the years has built on its original mission. Today, it is a vital organ that acts as the intellectual memory of the nation. The library provides the intellectual ammunition to aid government officers in policy implementation. However, the general direction of policy instability due to the military incursion to power sometimes created an imbalance between the intellectual memory of prior policies and the intellectual foundation of a new government. The library also stays afloat intellectually by receiving copies of books published in the country by both the government and private authorities through the legal deposit provision in the Library Act. This make the library one of the largest depositories of knowledge in the country. It also collects books on contemporary or new ideas from international organizations. The responsibilities of the institution also include the issuance of the ISBN and ISSN to publishing organizations, a process which was formerly cumbersome in the absence of appropriate enabling technology at the regional offices but is now getting easier with more awareness and infusion of mobile technology. Furthermore, as part of its mandate, the Library runs an annual Readership Promotion Campaign all over the country to create awareness about the importance of literacy and to get the citizenry reading. Challenges The National Library of Nigeria has challenges that inhibit it from fulfilling the stated mission objectives. * Dilapidated facilities and resources which are a result of inadequate funding. * The library headquarters operates from rented apartments as the complex which is meant to house it remains uncompleted since it was started in 2006. * The Library has 27 branches and is making efforts to effectively expand to the 36 state capitals of the federation as designated by the library decree of 1970. * Poor reading culture in Nigeria is also a challenge as this spawns a nonchalant attitude to the growth of the Library while hindering the uses of its facilities and services. * Adequate and progressive staff training to keep the professionals abreast of current best practices in the ever-evolving information sector especially as pertains use of technology to process resources and offer services is also a challenge ..

Kekushev's buildings are notable for his skillful use of metal ornaments and his signature with a lion (Lev) ornament or sculpture. Isakov Apartment Building, 1904-1906 Biography=Education= Kekushev was born in the family of a Russian officer in Vilnius (Maria Naschokina, p. 253; Simbirsk according to other sources). Kekushev graduated high school in Vilnius, and the Institute of Civil Engineers in Saint Petersburg (1883‚Äì1889). For one year, he worked as a state-employed construction engineer in Saint Petersburg, but relocated to Moscow in 1890. At first an assistant to architect Semyon Eybushits, he started independent practice in 1893. At the same time, Kekushev became a master in applied art technologies - iron forging, silver galvanization and chemical frosting of glass. Throughout the 1890s, Kekushev and Illarion Ivanov-Shitz were employed by Moscow-based railway companies and designed dozens of extant railway stations. =Art Nouveau= Own house, Ostozhenka Street, 1900-1903, was once crowned with a 3-meter lion statue Kekushev was the first practitioner of Art Nouveau in Moscow, starting with his apartment buildings in Varsonofyevskay Lane and Bolshaya Dmitrovka, completed 1893. His style (unlike the next generation of Art Nouveau architects like William Walcot and Fyodor Schechtel) is very close to the original Belgian style of Victor Horta. The new wave of architecture was endorsed and financed by prominent business figures like the Khludov and Morozov families and Jacob Reck. In 1898-1899, Kekushev won the first prize in the open contest for Hotel Metropol; financier Savva Morozov discarded the decision of a professional jury and awarded architectural design to William Walcot. However, the owners retained Kekushev as overall project manager. \\"None of this (Walcot's earlier) work is on the scale of the Metropole; Kekushev's assistance was probably crucial to the final realization of this complex structure, with its immense dome of glass and iron over an interior court\\" (Brumfield, chapter 3). Ponizovsky House, 42 Povarskaya Street, a part of Povarskaya estates built by Jacob Reck company Kekushev's talent and recognition peaked in 1900-1903, when Art Nouveau, for a while, became the dominant style in Moscow. His buildings include such diverse luxury residences as the timber-framed Nosov House (Electrozavodskaya Street) and stone and steel Mindovsky House (44 Povarskaya Street, now Embassy of New Zealand - a part of a large affluent community developed by Jacob Reck). Kekushev, skilled in interior finishes, practiced Gesamtkunstwerk approach, designing interiors down to the smallest details. Unlike other architects, who commissioned artwork finishes to independent artists, all Kekushev buildings have distinct Kekushev metal ornaments. =Withdrawal from practice= Mindovsky House, 44 Povarskaya Street After the Russian revolution of 1905, when public opinion \\"dismissed Art Nouveau as ephemera of fashion\\" (Brumfield, chapter 3) in favor of Neoclassical revival, Kekushev was unwilling or unable to change, and worked on low-profile, unimportant projects. By 1912 he practically disappeared from professional scene. Maria Naschokina, a historian of Art Nouveau, suggested that Kekushev's withdrawal was actually caused by unspecified (probably, mental) illness; this statement has not been thoroughly proved. Kekushev's last years remain a mystery; even the year of his death is disputed (1916 to 1919). =Nikolay Kekushev= The architect's son, Nikolay Kekushev, was a famous aviator who saw combat in 1924 in Central Asia, later working as aircraft engineer on Arctic flights in the 1920s and 1930s. He was a member of Pavel Golovin's air crew that was the first to reach the North Pole on May 5, 1937 in preparation for Ivan Papanin's polar expedition. During World War II, he flew 59 missions on a DC-3 to and from besieged Leningrad, evacuating starving residents; later, he served on anti-submarine Arctic patrols. In 1948 Nikolay Kekushev was arrested, and he spent six years in Dzhezkazgan labor camps. He survived and wrote a book of memoirs, Zveriada; however, it does not reveal much about his father's last years.

He has presented the Radio 4 programmes The Film Programme and Back Row.http://www.movie-film- review.com/devlisten.asp In 2013, he won the award as \\"Arts Reviewer of the Year\\" from the London Press Club. At Oxford University he was president of the Oxford Union, Editor of Isis, President of the Etceteras and Musical Director of Oxford Theatre Group. Tookey was elected chairman of The Critics' Circle in 1995, but his bid to become vice-president floundered due to the position he took on the 1996 film Crash. Tookey campaigned for the film to be banned, writing that \\"Crash is the point at which even a liberal society should draw the line.\\" The Observer film critic Philip French wrote that Tookey's \\"campaigning was thought to be in breach of the Critics' Circle's objects of promoting the art of criticism and supporting the advancement of the arts.\\" Tookey wrote a series of critical articles for the Mail regarding the film which saw Jonathan Coe of the New Statesman describe him as \\"the real architect of the antiCrash campaign\\". Tookey called for readers to boycott the products of distributor Sony, and questioned the suitability to the role of the then director of the British Board of Film Classification. Tookey denied charges that he was in favour of blanket censorship, writing in a letter to The Guardian that he has \\"frequently written and spoken against censorship and jumped to the defence of films (such as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and The Life Of Brian) which struck me as victims of unjust repression in the past.\\" He wrote in an article for Prospect magazine that his campaign against Crash was motivated by the fear that \\"Cronenberg's film might well have a \\"copycat effect\\" on a few unstable individuals\\" and could \\"also have a far more insidious longterm effect by eroticising sado-masochism and orthopaedic fetishism for people previously unaware of being turned on by acts of mutilation.\\" Tookey was also concerned at the precedent set by releasing such a film with an 18 certificate. In 2000 Tookey directed and co-produced the musical Hard Times, based on the Charles Dickens novel of the same name, which opened to mixed reviews at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket and closed the same year. 30 March 2009. Tookey also witnessed a man bleed to death from a stabbing in 1997, and his reaction troubled him: \\"It has brought home to me that I have seen so much violence on screen (the latest film is Crash) that I have become desensitised.

After college, she spent seven years teaching English and history in Schenectady, New York. She was living in New York City at the outbreak of World War II without a career, and later without a husband, who sent her a letter from London, England stating that he was divorcing her to marry his secretary, although she kept his surname after the divorce.Manhattan Mercury obituary Undaunted, she essentially created a career for herself in the fashion industry as a pattern designer.

At age 66, when most people are retiring, Brockman accepted a position at Kansas State University in the College of Human Ecology's Department of Clothing and Textiles teaching fashion design. She remained with the department until her second retirement in 1974.

He was drafted in the eighth round of the 1993 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Tennessee. Early years Thomas attended Miami Beach Senior High School, where he received third-team All-American and All-Conference honors in football as a senior. He also lettered in basketball and track. He enrolled at Butler Community College, where he registered 7 interceptions as a freshman and 10 (second in the nation) as a sophomore, on his way to becoming one of the top cornerbacks in junior college. As a junior in 1990, he transferred to the University of Tennessee. He appeared in all 13 games as a backup cornerback, posting 17 tackles, one interception (returned for 51-yards against UTEP) and one pass defensed. As a senior in 1991, he was redshirted. In October, an off-field incident caused him to lose his final year of sports eligibility at Tennessee. In 1992, he didn't play football but still stay at the school and graduate. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys= Even though he was out of football for two years, the Dallas Cowboys selected him in the eighth round (203rd overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft. During his time with the team he was one of the tallest cornerbacks in the NFL and showed promise playing special teams and in some of the nickel packages. He was a part of the Super Bowl XXVIII winning team. He appeared in 12 games and finished with 8 special teams tackles. In 1994, he appeared in all 16 games as a backup cornerback. He collected 4 defensive tackles and 20 special teams tackles (fourth on the team). =Jacksonville Jaguars= The Jacksonville Jaguars selected him from the Cowboys roster in the 1995 NFL Expansion Draft.

In 1997, although he was named starter at right cornerback and appeared in all 16 games, it has been speculated that he was never the same player after his injury. He collected a career-high 88 tackles, along with 2 interceptions, 15 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. In 1998, he started 12 out of 14 games at right cornerback.

It was first published as part of his collection Songs of Innocence in 1789 and is the counterpart to \\"Infant Sorrow\\", which was published at a later date in Songs of Experience in 1794. Ralph Vaughan Williams set the poem to music in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs. The poem File:Songs of innocence and experience infant joy blake.ogg  Description  Both \\"Infant Joy\\" and \\"Infant Sorrow\\" use two stanzas; however, \\"Infant Sorrow\\" uses a regular AABB rhyme scheme for both stanzas; whereas, ‚ÄòInfant Joy‚Äô uses ABCDAC for the first stanza, and ABCDDC for the second. The most marked pattern in ‚ÄòInfant Joy‚Äô is the double rhyme repeated in lines three, six, nine, and twelve, this pattern contrasts with the more insistent rhymes found in \\"Infant Sorrow\\". The two stanzas and their contrasting speakers, use repetition with variation link many of the other 'Songs of Innocence' poems, demonstrating what critic Heather Glen called the \\"difference yet harmony between the two speakers.\\"Glen 25-26 Analysis Copy AA of William Blake's hand painted print of \\"Infant Joy\\". This copy, printed and painted in 1826, is currently held by the Fitzwilliam Museum. Critic Jennifer Waller describes the accompanying illustration adding meaning to the poem, saying \\"a twining vine bearing flamboyant flowers, suggesting passion and sexuality[;] the lower leaves of the plant are angular and strained and suggest a hint of impending experience.\\" Thus, for Waller \\"origins of the scene\\" lie in \\"the simplicity of domestic love through the expressions of frank sexuality\\". Autonomy and selfhood center the relationship of the poem's two speakers, taking up Blake's common thematic emphasis on the nature of the \\"self\\". Critic Heather Glen describes the second stanza as showing a very real experience in which a \\"child's sense of autonomous selfhood appears within a relationship of mutual joy.\\"Glen 131-132.

It was founded in Lerwick, in the Shetland Isles by Ghufar Razaq, Graeme Storey, Tim Cole and Paul Martin. According to the Shetland Fishing News, a journal of Shetland's fishing industry, the company began trading on 13 October 1994.  History  In October 1994, Zetnet began trading as Zetnet Services. It became a Limited Company (Zetnet Services Ltd) in October 1995. In 1996, Zetnet was thrown into the media spotlight through what nearly became a landmark legal case testing UK copyright laws on the internet. In March 1999 Zetnet founded online gaming service Netgames UK, the brainchild of Sandy Sandom and Phil O'Malley. It was originally a wholly owned subsidiary, sharing Zetnet technical staff, but was sold in May 2000 and incorporated as Netgames UK Ltd. The company was run successfully until August 2001 when reports of a press release detailing a fall-out between Netgames UK management and its technical staff were seen. In 1999, Zetnet hosted the CVS tree for the eggdrop project, an IRC bot. The CVS was maintained by staff member Jonathan Miles (Cybah), who also coordinated and committed patch contributions for the Eggdrop Development Team. In 2001, Zetnet took over Charis Internet Services, a Birmingham-based ISP. In January 2002 Zetnet bought the customers of troubled ISP Cloud-Nine Communications, which had suffered a DDoS attack. Cloud Nine were based in Basingstoke, run by CEO Emeric Miszti and Operations Director John Parr. On May 12, 2003, Zetnet co-founder and Technical Director, Tim Cole, died. The Zetnet home page was changed during the following week, to say \\"with great sadness Zetnet announces the death of Tim Cole co-founder director\\" and also \\"Tim had been suffering with heart problems for many years. On Sunday evening he had a heart attack from which he did not recover\\". According to an unconfirmed source, Tim's headstone says simply \\"internet pioneer\\" and can be found in the yard of the Dunrossness Kirk, Dunrossness in the south of Shetland.User \\"Robbie\\", \\"Talk:Dunrossness Kirk\\", \\"Shetlopedia - ThOe Shetland Encyclopaedia that anyone can edit\\", 21:43, September 20th 2007 (MDT); http://shetlopedia.com/Talk:Dunrossness_Kirk In February 2005, Zetnet closed its head office in the Shetland Isles. According to The Shetland News, much of Zetnet's operations were run from an office in Manchester at the time. In November 2005 Zetnet Services Ltd was put into administration owing creditors a large sum of money and an administration committee was later formed by the creditors to investigate the finances of the company. The administrators sold the assets and good will of the company to Zetnet Limited which was formed by some of the existing directors of Zetnet Services Ltd and some new shareholders - with John Hyslop as managing director. In May 2007, a press release surfaced on PRWeb which indicated that Zetnet Ltd was to be purchased by Solutrea Ltd, a \\"wireless and digital signage solutions provider\\". John Hyslop was quoted as Zetnet's Managing Director at the time. The deal was reported to have been worth \\"¬£857,000 in cash upon closing\\". However, the agreement was \\"subject to approval by the Powerstar International Inc. (TSX.V : PWS), board of directors and the Toronto Ventures Exchange\\". No further information could be found to confirm that this deal was ever completed. In July 2008, Zetnet was acquired by Breathe Networks Limited (BNL), according to a news article by ISPreview.co.uk. Zetnet joined other BNL brands such as breathe, macunlimited, Ecosse, Intensive Networks, Bush Internet and Fast4. Although BNL stated an intent to operate Zetnet independently, it subsequently consolidated a number of Zetnet's services into its own platform during the first half of 2009, with some problems. On 16 July 2009 Zetnet Ltd was placed into administration.  Breathe Migration  Zetnet's reputation took a severe nose dive in July 2009 when Breathe's attempts to change the Zetnet email system resulted in thousands of users being unable to access their email for weeks. This tarnished the company's reputation badly with many established long term customers leaving Zetnet to find a reliable ISP. Breathe had taken the remarkable decision not to notify any of Zetnet's customers before moving them to their servers, nor had they (Breathe) taken a secure backup of the Zetnet database of e-mail username and password combinations prior to the failed migration process. This resulted in an unprecedented request for customers to complete a form on the Zetnet website detailing their full e-mail address and associated password. Regrettably, even this 'Last-ditch' attempt to recover some credibility failed in many cases and there was no way that 'Catch-all' addresses could be recovered by this process. During the chaos which followed, customers were unable to contact Zetnet by telephone or e-mail to resolve website and e-mail issues. It seems that this loss of service is a regular feature of Breathe acquisitions.  Legal case  In 1996, Zetnet was caught in the middle of a legal case between two of its local customers, The Shetland Times and The Shetland News, over copyright infringement. The web sites of both customers were hosted by Zetnet.

He was born in San Salvador to Pedro Delgado and Josefa Rodr√≠guez. His father was Panamanian and his mother Salvadoran. They were not married. Early career He was one of the leaders of the independence movements in 1811 and 1814. Together with Father Jos√© Mat√≠as Delgado and Manuel Jos√© Arce he participated in the first Cry for Independence on November 5, 1811. He was secretary of the junta that in November 1811 functioned as the first independent government of the province. He was mayor of San Salvador in 1814, elected by popular vote. In this position, he supported the insurrectionary movement of January 24, 1814. He was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison, but was pardoned in 1819. In November 1821 he was named a member of the governing body of the Province of El Salvador. The following January he signed the act separating El Salvador from the old Kingdom of Guatemala, in order to avoid incorporation into the Mexican Empire, which Guatemala had approved. He was commissioned along with Arce and other deputies of the provincial congress to negotiate in Washington, D.C. for the admission of El Salvador to the United States. The fall of the Mexican Empire in 1823 and the independence of Central America ended this diplomatic initiative. As chief of state of El Salvador On April 22, 1824 the constituent assembly elected Rodr√≠guez chief of state, and the following day he put into effect the abolition of slavery in the state (declared on December 31, 1823). The government also decreed the foundation of the Diocese of San Salvador, and made Father Jos√© Mat√≠as Delgado, hero of the independence movement, the first bishop. In May 1824 the National Assembly of the State ordered the new constitution published and sworn to. Rodr√≠guez established the Supreme Court of Justice. He called elections for chief of state, which were won by Juan Vicente Villacorta D√≠az, with Mariano Prado as vice-chief of state. On October 1, 1824 it transferred the executive power from Rodr√≠guez to Prado pending the inauguration of Villacorta. The latter took office on December 13, 1824. During Rodr√≠guez's term of office, the first official printing press in El Salvador entered service (June 1824). It printed the first newspaper in the state, El Semanario Pol√≠tico Mercantil. The first issue appeared on July 31, 1824. Later life After supporting the party of the fiebres for years and serving as treasury secretary, Rodr√≠guez retired to private life. He passed his later years at his hacienda \\"San Jer√≥nimo\\", near Cojutepeque. He took minor orders with the Franciscans and performed charitable works. He died of colera on his hacienda in 1847.

The film stars Karthi in his feature film debut as the title character, with Priyamani as the female lead and Ponvannan, Saravanan, Ganja Karuppu, Sampath Raj, and Sujatha Sivakumar playing supporting roles. Produced by Studio Green, it features a soundtrack and score composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, cinematography by Ramji and editing by Raja Mohammad. Paruthiveeran was entirely shot in Madurai and its surroundings. After two years of making, the film was released on 23 February 2007 and received universal critical acclaim. Priyamani was awarded National film award for best actress for her performance as Muththazhagu in that year. The film won prizes at major film award ceremonies in India, including two National Film Awards, six Filmfare Awards South and two Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, among others, whilst being screened at several international film festivals such as the Berlin International Film Festival and the Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema as well. It also emerged a high commercial success, running successfully for more than one year in theatres.  Plot  The story is set in a rural area around Madurai in the village called Paruthiyur, which still practices caste segregation as a result of the controversial Criminal Tribes Act imposed by the British colonists, where members of impoverished communities are stereotyped as generational criminals. Paruthiveeran (Karthi) is a country brash whose inter-caste parents were ostracized by the villagers since his lower caste father married his higher caste mother. After his parents' death, Paruthiveeran was mostly raised by his doting paternal uncle Chevvaazhai (Saravanan), who pampers and accompanies him in every misbehavior to keep him happy. Having grown up among his mother's people, he is often arrested for petty crimes. His one ambition in life is to gain enough notoriety to be on TV news and to be thrown into Madras Jail. He often bullies Paruthiyur villagers for money and fun. Paruthiveeran's cross cousin Muththazhagu (Priyamani) is the daughter of his snobbish uncle who is a respected member of the village's council and a caste sectarian. Muththazhagu has been in love with Paruthiveeran since childhood, but he remains unmoved and keeps her at bay. When they were children, Paruthiveeran saved Muththazhagu from drowning in a well. She promised to marry him and be by his side forever and starts to love him against her parents' will as they do not approve of Parututhiveeran's inter-caste background. In order to delay her marriage with anybody else, she fails in her tests at school on purpose to be in the same grade class as Paruthiveeran. At times, Paruthiveeran is violent towards her, but she still loves him. When Paruthiveeran finally accepts Muththazhagu's love for him and decides to marry her, the feud between the two families comes in the way. Determined to marry Muththazhagu, he warns her against marrying anyone else by threatening to cut her into pieces. Undeterred by his threats, her parents press ahead with the preparations for her marriage with a boy of their choice. Since Muththazhagu is not able to convince her parents otherwise, she runs away from home in order to elope with Paruthiveeran. However, while hiding away in an abandoned building while Paruthiveeran is away making necessary arrangements, she comes across four of Paruthiveeran's acquaintances who mistake her for one of his prostitutes. They brutally gang rape her and leave her to die. Later, Paruthiveeran returns and finds her dying. She beseeches Paruthiveeran to cut her into pieces as she does not want anybody to find her in her present state. Paruthiveeran, on her request, chops her corpse into pieces. While walking away in a neurotic state, he is found by Muththazhagu's father Kazhuvathevan (Ponvannan) and her other relatives. Assuming him to be her kidnapper and killer, they beat him to death.

Although Karthi revealed he preferred directing to acting, he agreed to take up acting since his father convinced him to do so. When director Ameer approached him to play the titular character in the film he accepted the offer because the film was \\" ... so compelling\\". About 60 debutants, mostly real-time people from the region, appeared in the film. The number of newcomers who acted in the film, notably, outweighed the number of professional artists, with Priyamani, Ponvannan, Saravanan and Ganja Karuppu being the only four experienced actors. Furthermore, no dubbing artists were involved in the production and all artists were brought to Chennai had dubbed their original voice, =Filming= Filming was held at various locations that, according to Ameer, were never before explored by Tamil cinema. A village carnival was created by art director Jacki for the film and shot for 10 days in Karumathur, Madurai. The filming started in July 2005 and experienced financial difficulties, and was almost abandoned by mid‚Äì2006. The film's director Ameer taking over the production and later by Gnanavel Raja. He later stated that he had incurred heavy financial loss as a producer of the film.  Music  The film's score as well as the soundtrack were scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja, teaming up with his friend Ameer following two successive successful collaborations in Mounam Pesiyadhe (2002) and Raam (2005). The soundtrack album was released on 29 Decrember 2006 at Green Park Hotel in Chennai, with several prominent film personalities participating in the event, including fellow actor Vijay, who launched the audio. The album consists of six songs, including one instrumental track, featuring the nadaswaram only. It features vocals from Yuvan Shankar Raja's father Ilaiyaraaja, director Ameer himself and professional playback singers Shreya Ghoshal, Manikka Vinayagam and Madhumitha. Moreover, a couple of traditional, village-based singers contributed to the album by lending their voice to a few songs. All lyrics were written by Snehan. Paruthiveeran was notably the first ever entirely village-based film Yuvan Shankar Raja had scored music for. He composed a folk music-based score and used rural sounds with instruments as dholak, nadaswaram, thavil and urumee. Yuvan Shankar Raja received critical acclaim for his score, while the soundtrack album initially got mostly unfavorable reviews, being described as a \\"letdown\\" and \\"disappointment\\", raising to question whether it could attract today's \\"modern\\" audience. Following the film's release however, critics unanimously made very positive remarks in regards to the film score. Baradwaj Rangan labelled it a \\"magnificently earthy score\\", while Malathi Rangarajan noted that the composer \\"proves he is a chip off the old block in rustic music too\\". Other critics hailed his music as \\"excellent\\", and as \\"unmistakably a milestone on his road to the pinnacle that his father Ilayaraja has reached\\". Due to its successful run at the box office, the songs enjoyed popularity as well, particularly among the younger generation. The song \\"Oororam Puliyamaram\\" in particular was the Chartbuster number, also being chosen as the \\"Best Folk Song of the Year 2007\\" at the Isaiyaruvi Tamil Music Awards, whilst the entire album itself was named as \\"Isaiyaruvi Best Album of the Year 2007\\".  Release  The film was dubbed into Telugu and released as Malligadu on 2 March 2012.  Reception  The film received overall positive critical response, particularly regarding the lead artists' performances. Sriram Iyer of Rediff gave the film three out of five stars, lauding it as a \\"remarkable effort\\" and claiming that Ameer \\"successfully brings alive the feel of the pastures\\". The reviewer appreciated the cast and crew, describing Karthi's performance as \\"excellent\\", while citing that Saravanan \\"excels\\" and Priyamani had done \\"a fairly good job in her deglamourised role\\". A Behindwoods critic wrote that Paruthiveeran \\"lives up to all that it promised and more\\". Heaping praise on the director, the reviewer further adds that Ameer had \\"shown his class again\\" and \\"enhance[d] his reputation as a master craftsman\\". Russell Edwards of Variety cited, \\"rough production values are mitigated by a myriad of sophisticated cinematic techniques that show this is no boondocks effort. Fests that appreciate curry flavors will eat this one up, though uninitiated aud[ience]s could experience culture shock\\". Furthermore, he noted that Ameer's \\"creative helming, which includes split-screen, appears unbridled and sometimes outright chaotic, but always serves the script\\", while writing that performances were \\"consistent with the bombastic storytelling\\". A reviewer from nowrunning.com called the film a \\"gripping tale narrated with a skill and imagination which only directors like Amir are endowed with\\", rating it three out of five. Baradwaj Rangan called Paruthiveeran a \\"classic, one for the ages\\" and a \\"showcase for how good filmmaking can (almost) overcome mediocre material\\", while noting that Karthi gave \\"a superb first-film performance by any standard, and it makes you reach for that oldest of movie-myth cliches: A star is born.\\" Other critics have offered criticism of the violence and brutality of some sequences in the film. A Sify critic wrote that it was \\"undoubtedly [...] a brave film and full credit goes to the director for making every scene realistic and characters life-like\\", while criticizing that Ameer's script was \\"too thin on logic\\" and the climax \\"too heavy, dark and morbid.\\" However, in regards to the performances, the reviewer, too, heaped praise on the actors, describing Karthi as \\"spectacular\\" and Saravanan as \\"terrific\\" and adding that Priya Mani \\"... steals the show with her spontaneity and authenticity\\". Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu claimed that the film was \\"the genuine depiction of village life\\" that \\"transports you to the era of classics in a rustic ambience, Bharatiraaja style\\", further citing that \\"all the same, when graphic pictures of gang rape and killing in cold blood dominate, things becomes too much to stomach\\" and that Ameer \\"only creates the impression that village folks as a whole are a belligerent lot.\\" = Box office = Released on 23 February 2007, Paruthiveeran faced competition from Mozhi, which was released on the same day. The film took a big opening at the Chennai box office, collecting 3.69 crore from 92 prints in Tamil Nadu in its opening weekend. The film continued to rank at first at the Chennai box office for five successive weeks, being ousted only by the Hollywood production 300 during the Easter weekend. At the end of its run, the film had reportedly grossed a share 15 crore at the box office, being declared one of the most commercially successful Tamil films of the year.  Accolades  The film and many of its cast and crew have been awarded or nominated by many associations in India and worldwide for the film. Notably, Priyamani has won the Best Actress prizes at all awards ceremonies. Paruthiveeran was honoured with the \\"Special Mention\\" award from the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema (NETPAC) at the 58th Berlin International Film Festival. The film was screened five times at the Berlin Film Festival in two German subtitled versions and three English subtitled versions. 2008 Berlin International Film Festival (Germany)http://www.berlinale.de/media/pdf_word/pm_1/58_berlinale_2/58_IFB_Awards.pdf * Netpac Award ‚Äì Special Mention ‚Äì Ameer 2007 Cinema Journalists Association Awards * Best Film ‚Äì Paruthiveeran * Best Director ‚Äì Ameer * Best Actress ‚Äì Priyamani 2007 Filmfare Awards South (India) * Best Film ‚Äì Tamil ‚Äì Paruthiveeran * Best Director ‚Äì Tamil ‚Äì Ameer * Best Actor ‚Äì Tamil ‚Äì Karthi * Best Actress ‚Äì Tamil ‚Äì Priyamani * Best Supporting Actor ‚Äì Tamil ‚Äì Saravanan * Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Tamil ‚Äì Sujatha Sivakumar * Nominated ‚Äì Filmfare Award for Best Music Direction‚Äì Tamil ‚Äì Yuvan Shankar Raja 2007 National Film Awards (India) * Silver Lotus Award ‚Äì Best Actress ‚Äì Priyamani * Silver Lotus Award ‚Äì Best Editor ‚Äì Raja Mohammad 2007 Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema * Best Film Award ‚Äì Paruthiveeran * Best Actress Award ‚Äì Priyamani 2006 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards * Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film ‚Äì Second Prize * Best Actress ‚Äì Priyamani * Special Prize ‚Äì Actor ‚Äì Karthi 2007 Vijay Awards * Best Film ‚Äì Paruthiveeran * Best Actress ‚Äì Priyamani * Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Sujatha * Best Debut Actor ‚Äì Karthi * Nominated ‚Äì Best Director ‚Äì Ameer * Nominated ‚Äì Best Supporting Actor ‚Äì Saravanan * Nominated ‚Äì Best Music Director ‚Äì Yuvan Shankar Raja * Nominated ‚Äì Best Cinematographer ‚Äì Ramji * Nominated ‚Äì Best Editor ‚Äì Raja Mohammed * Nominated ‚Äì Best Art Director ‚Äì Jackson * Nominated ‚Äì Best Lyricist ‚Äì Snehan * Nominated ‚Äì Best Story-Screenplay Writer ‚Äì Ameer  Controversy  There was a controversy surrounding the ownership of the movie. Ameer has complained that the original producer K. E. Gnanavel Raja, couldn't finance the movie till its completion, so he supposedly gave up the movie to Ameer. But towards the completion of the movie, Ameer ran out of funds and the movie went back to Gnanavel. Since the release of the movie, both parties have been accusing each other for failing to make a payment which each owes from the other.

It depicts the moment at which Isabella's brothers realise that there is a romance between the two young people, and plot to murder Lorenzo so they can marry Isabella to a wealthy nobleman. Isabella, wearing grey at the right, is being handed a blood orange on a plate by the doomed Lorenzo. A cut blood orange is symbolic of the neck of someone who has just been decapitated, referring to Isabella cutting off Lorenzo's head to take it with her after finding him buried. One of her brothers violently kicks a frightened dog while cracking a nut. Millais and his colleague William Holman Hunt had both produced drawings illustrating episodes from the poem, but only Millais worked his up into a full painting (Hunt's 1868 Isabella and the Pot of Basil used a completely different composition). Both drawings used distorted perspective and angular poses characteristic of medieval art, by which the Pre-Raphaelites were influenced.Walker Art Gallery: John Everett Millais, Lorenzo and Isabella Millais also draws on the precedent of William Hogarth's satirical depictions of an arranged marriage Marriage √†-la-mode. Composition and meaning The painting is structured with deliberately distorted perspective, elongating the right hand side of the table and flattening the figures ranged along it. Following Pre-Raphaelite theory, Millais almost eliminates chiaroscuro and exaggerates the intensity of juxtaposed colours and tones - as evidenced in the flat black tunic set against the sharply modelled white cloth of the servant at the right, whose lower body virtually disappears as his yellow stockings semi-merge with the background. Millais also carefully characterises each figure with equal precision. Another distinctive Pre-Raphaelite feature is the inclusion of images and patterns within the image as a whole. Each of the plates has a distorted picture glazed into its surface. The base of the bench on which Isabella sits contains a carving depicting a kneeling figure under which appear the letters PRB (standing for Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood). The central motif of the thuggish brother's kicking leg and upturned chair further disturbs the equilibrium of the composition, as does the deliberately confusing \\"crowding\\" of the figures on the table and elaboration of motifs. Hidden phallic symbols In 2012, British art curator Carol Jacobi published an article about sexual symbols in the painting. They were all on or near the character in the front left, who is stretching out his leg and using a nutcracker. The shadow on the table near his crotch area, his leg, and the nutcracker were all argued to represent a phallus. Jacobi said: \\"The shadow is clearly phallic, and it also references the sex act, with the salt tipped into the shadow.\\" She also argued that it would have been deliberate, but did not know what the painter's intention with it was. However, she stated that it was \\"not a Freudian slip, or a hypocritical, furtive innuendo. The imagery of masturbation and the anxieties around it and being unable to control yourself sexually would have been well known.\\"  Adaptation  Sam Walsh (1934-1989) painted The Dinner Party in 1980. It is one of his most complex works and is inspired by Millais' Pre-Raphaelite painting Isabella. Both paintings are in the Walker Art Gallery at Liverpool. In this interpretation, the sitters, who would never have met all at the same time, are people from all periods of its life.

Joseph's musical career began in the mid-1950s, learning and playing guitar with many Puerto Rican groups, \\"conjuntos\\", and playing diverse rhythmic variations of Puerto Rican music. He replaced the guitar strings with electronic strings and used the guitar as a bass, playing only the last four strings. With this convention, he became a bass player. Soon after, he graduated to Fender bass guitar and an Ampeg bass amplifier. Joseph was one of handful of bass players at that time, who introduced and popularized the bass guitar in the Latin, Jazz, Latin/Jazz and R&B; venue. Throughout the 1960s, Joseph performed at the Palladium and in the late Sixties and early Seventies, he performed at the Roseland Ballroom in New York. During the same era, he also played bass at Birdland, a club with regular jazz and Latin Jazz performances. As a bass player and vocalist, Joseph accompanied several bandleaders and musicians during the main era of Latin music and Latin Jazz, including Arsenio Rodr√≠guez and Candido. Arsenio Rodr√≠guez was a Cuban tres guitarist, regarded as the originator of a Latin style called the son montuno. He taught Joseph the techniques of Cuban bass rhythms and syncopation.

Joseph recorded with Candido as vocalist, with Tito Puente conducting and playing vibes and timbales and he often substituted with Cachao on bass, (Tico Records, Candido's Latin McGuffas Dust). After the death of his mentor, Arsenio Rodr√≠guez, Joseph partially retreated from performing and relocated to the Litchfield Hills of northwestern Connecticut, dedicating most of his time to composing and orchestrating. Joseph has since relocated to Richmond, Virginia and has been working with his son - film director, producer, and international instructor Josue Joseph on the international project called \\"La Epoca\\", which is about the Palladium-era in New York, and Afro-Cuban music and rhythms, as well as Mambo and Salsa as dances.

The series was first launched in 2004 with the publication of Undead and Unwed, and as of 2015 there are fourteen books in the series. Davidson attributes the popularity of the series to the absurdism, tone, and believability of the characters. The series was a reaction to what Davidson saw as cliches and unrealistic characters in paranormal romance novels.  Synopsis  The series follows Betsy Taylor, a woman that loses her job and is killed on the day of her thirtieth birthday. She later awakens in a funeral home and discovers that not only is she a vampire but she's the queen of the vampires. At the start of the series Betsy is frequently at odds with fellow vampire Eric Sinclair, however as the novels progress the two fall in love and eventually get married. Betsy also discovers that she has a half-sister, Laura, who is the Antichrist fated to take over the world. Book listing The first four volumes have been reprinted as Betsy the Vampire Queen. Volumes 5 - 7 have been reprinted as Betsy Bride of the Vampire and also includes Dead and Loving It (short stories).http://maryjanicedavidson.net/coming-soon =Undead and Unwed= Undead and Unwed is the first adventure of Elizabeth Anne \\"Betsy\\" Taylor in the Undead series after her transformation into a vampire. The book was released on March 2, 2004 through Berkley Books and was on the Maclean's bestseller list for April 4, 2004. Betsy Taylor‚Äîformer model, newly unemployed secretary, 30, and still single‚Äîwakes up after being flattened by a Pontiac Aztek in a tacky coffin wearing cheap knock-off shoes. Her mother is glad she is back, albeit as a vampire, but her stepmother is enraged that Betsy has reclaimed her designer-shoe collection. With a wealthy best friend and a newly acquired doctor pal who is not susceptible to her formidable allure, she sets out to right wrongs but is abducted by Nostro, a tacky 500-year-old vampire who rules the undead roost. It seems that Betsy is an anomaly: a vampire who doesn't burn in sunlight, can fight the urge to feed, and is not repulsed by religious articles, all of which may make her the prophesied Queen of the Vampires. Teaming up with gorgeous vampire Eric Sinclair, who is in her opinion a major pervert, she takes on Nostro and his minions. Critical reception has been mostly positive. Kliatt gave the audiobook for Undead and Unwed a favorable review, writing that \\"Wu adds a bevy of emotions to Betsy's otherwise repetitive one-shoe note, making her both likable and amusing.\\" =Undead and Unemployed= Published in 2004, the book follows Betsy Taylor, a newly turned vampire that has to deal with the aftermath of becoming the new Queen of Vampires - a role that has resulted in her marrying the sexy Eric Sinclair. He irritates her, however when multiple vampires end up getting murdered she finds that she must turn to him for help. The Knight Ridder gave Undead and Unemployed a favorable review, stating that it was \\"very silly stuff, but silly done just right.\\" Kliatt also gave the book a favorable review. =Undead and Unappreciated= Undead and Unappreciated is the third novel in the Undead series. The breezily written paranormal romance novel introduces a major character to the series: Laura, Betsy's half-sister and the daughter of the Devil herself. The book marks the series' first time being printed in hardback and was listed on the Wall Street Journal's hardcover bestseller list for July 14, 2005. The novel has two prologues. The first prologue relates how the devil, out of boredom, possessed a \\"not very nice\\" woman and gave birth to a daughter; however, the devil soon returned to Hell, since she preferred it to living with a newborn. The devil's daughter, Laura, was given up for adoption by her biological mother, Antonia, for whom the possession was like a fugue state. Ironically, Laura is adopted by a Presbyterian minister and his wife, the Goodmans. The second prologue introduces the recently turned vampire Betsy Taylor, the heroine of the Undead series of paranormal romance novels, as she crashes a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, where she hopes to learn techniques to control her thirst for blood. The two prologues are related because Laura is Betsy's half-sister, sharing the same father; the not-very-nice Antonia is Betsy's stepmother. This third novel of the series has thirty-five chapters and, as usual, is told from the point of view of Betsy (first-person narrative). The early chapters introduce Betsy, who has become the Queen of the Vampires through odd circumstances, and her circle of friends/roommates. Her best friend is the very cool and very wealthy Jessica, whom she's known since the seventh grade; Jessica is patient with Betsy and supportive. Another close friend and confidante is Marc Spangler, an emergency-ward physician. Other major human characters include Betsy's father and stepmother Antonia (\\"the Ant\\"), who are expecting a baby, Betsy's professor mom Elise (a Civil War historian) and a policeman, Nick Berry. On the vampire side, Betsy is betrothed to the earnest Eric Sinclair, now King of the Vampires; although Eric is smitten with her, Betsy is not enthusiastic. The novel is framed by a minor story, a wedding between a vampire and a human, Andrea Mercer and Daniel Harris, who are friends with Betsy. Such marriages are almost unheard-of because vampires had traditionally viewed human beings as \\"sheep\\", that is, as food rather than romantic partners. In an early chapter, Betsy is asked to preside at the wedding; she does so in the final chapter, quoting from Romeo and Juliet: \\"what love can do, that dares love attempt\\". Throughout the novel, Betsy reminds herself that she needs to prepare for the wedding; Betsy's distractions are also highlighted by noting when she forgets about the upcoming wedding. The plot begins in earnest when Betsy receives a non- invitation to her stepmother's baby shower; the shower is scheduled for daylight hours, making it impossible for vampires to attend. To reinforce the snub, Betsy's weak-willed father visits Betsy at home to ask her to stay away, where he lets slip that the new baby is Antonia's second child. Betsy and her friends confirm this revelation from Antonia herself, who describes unwillingly how she woke up with no memories of the preceding ten months, and dropped the baby girl, Laura, off at the hospital. Much of the novel revolves around the search for Laura and getting to know her. Laura turns out to be a beautiful but bashful girl just beginning college, and eager to do the right thing for everyone. She's very sweet-natured and wholesome, always seeking peaceful solutions, and making friends with everyone, even people with difficult tempers. Getting to know Laura, Betsy likes her (although she envies her beauty) and can't bring herself to tell her about her sordid vampiric life or that Laura herself is the \\"spawn of Satan\\" and destined to conquer the world. Before finding Laura, Betsy is frustrated by not knowing enough and resolves to read the Book of the Dead, a holy relic for vampires analogous to the Bible. The Book was written by an insane vampire who could see the future; unfortunately, it also drives anyone reading it insane. Throwing caution to the wind, Betsy reads the Book for several hours. The Book describes Betsy's ascension to Queen of the Vampires and her marriage to Eric, and also predicts that her half-sister Laura is fated to take over the world. Unfortunately, the book drives Betsy insane or, rather, changes her into a traditionally thinking vampire, as shown by the novel's first-person perspective. In that state, she attacks her human friends Jessica and Marc, indulges unbridled passions with her consort Eric, and tries to kill his vampire assistant Tina, who defeats her handily. She wakes up with a bruised head, a recovered sanity and much remorse ‚Äì and also a new power, to awaken before sunset, which she uses to take Laura to Antonia's baby shower, so that Laura can meet her birth mother. Throughout the remainder of the novel, she tries to recover her friends' trust, particularly Jessica's, and also make amends with Eric. The novel's climax occurs in a nightclub, Scratch. Betsy inherited the club, but the vampire staff are unhappy with her non-traditional changes, including not allowing them to drink blood from humans or kill them. The staff form a union and strike to demand better \\"working conditions\\". As their bargaining chip, the staff kidnap Betsy's half-sister Laura, mistaking her for an ordinary human girl. Unfortunately for them, they handle her too roughly and, despite her dislike of violence, Laura begins killing them with weapons formed from hellfire. Eric joins them and the three together win the fight with the vampires. Laura reveals that she'd known all along about Betsy and about herself, but she was waiting for Betsy to trust her enough. Laura is convinced that she can overcome her demonic heritage and be a good person, although she also displays a touch of temper. Later, Betsy meets the Devil herself‚Äîresembling a wonderfully dressed Lena Olin‚Äîwho reveals that Laura will indeed take over the world. The novel is also marked by several minor stories that contribute to characterizing Betsy and her friends. It opens with a semi- serious discussion between Marc and Betsy about his recovery from alcoholism. Also near the beginning, Eric and his long-time assistant Tina return from a trip to Europe; Eric gives Betsy a little shoe necklace, playing on Betsy's well-known weakness for shoes and characterizing how much he cares for her. Betsy's compassion is highlighted by her treatment of \\"George\\", one of the Fiends she inherited from another vampire vanquished in an earlier novel. Fiends are vampires that have been driven insane, unable to speak or reason, by denying them blood. Most of the Fiends are being tended to by Betsy's vampire friend Alice, but George continually escapes and makes his way to Betsy's house. Betsy begins to feed him her own blood, and George begins to recover his sanity by learning to crochet. Undead and Unappreciated was reviewed by Booklist, Publishers Weekly, and the Chronicle. =Undead and Unreturnable= The fourth novel in the Undead series, begins at Christmastime in the Kingdom of the dead (Minneapolis), which is complicated as it sounds. Betsy Taylor isn't going to let a little thing like death and blood-drinking stop her from enjoying the holidays or planning her upcoming spring wedding to drop-dead gorgeous vamp Eric Sinclair. But all is not merry and bright-Betsy is plagued by ghosts who demand her help in rectifying their past mistakes, and a serial killer is on the loose. With his victims all being, blond women. Besty fits the profile exactly... The book starts out with the knowledge that Betsy is technically dead, however everyone but close family and friends think that she is still alive. In Betsy's life she has a stepmother, Antonia (the Ant) who gives birth to a younger brother, Jon, and her best friend, rich Jessica, and Laura, is technically her half-sister but also the devil's daughter after Satan possessed her stepmother (The Ant who gave her up to adoption to, ironically, the Goodman's). She also receives attention from a human boy who is a past member of a gang of vampie slayers. She also has a gay human friend called Marc, a doctor she saved in the first novel from suicide and a human policemen who is a former flame named Nick Berry. Aside from all of this she has vampire servants who work for her and a hostage wild vampire dubbed George the Fiend. George is a wild vampire created by a 500-year-old vampire Betsy killed. She feeds him with her blood to make him stronger and Jessica teaches him different things such as crocheting. Laura later attacks George the Fiend thinking her mother (Satan) is using him to annoy her and meddle in her life. After Betsy tries to break up the fight Laura stabs her with a sword forged by Hellfire that kills magical creatures, however it doesn't kill her. After this Laura is sent to feed him. Eric and Betsy fight after she reveals she can hear his thoughts during sex. Eric is hurt she doesn't tell him earlier and goes back to his room which causes Betsy to point out that he hasn't fully committed to their relationship. Also, in an attempt to connect with her people Betsy starts an advice column intended for new vampires which others deem as stupid. Also, the human boy, with the decidedly shady past as an ex-vampire slayer, decides to write her life story as a fiction story and publish it through his university course, however Sinclair and his best friend Tina wipe his memory of it to save Betsy from exposure. After a serial killer known as the \\"Driveway Killer\\" kills her stepmother's next door neighbor a ghost starts plaguing Betsy. Laura and her set out to find him and discover him in a rundown house with a hostage. Laura kills him and the two set the hostage free. Betsy finds herself somewhat frightened of Laura doing the fight scene in which the overtake the serial killer and set the hostage free. In this novel it seems that Antonia knows that Laura is her daughter. The book has received reviews from Kliatt, Booklist, and the Library Journal. =Undead and Unpopular= Published in 2006, Undead and Unpopular begins with Betsy Taylor, Queen of Vampires, celebrating her 31st birthday and her 1st anniversary of being dead (or perhaps that should be undead.) She has told her friends that she doesn‚Äôt want a party but she is sure that they are planning a surprise party for her. She is trying to plan her summer wedding to Sinclair but it doesn‚Äôt help that he is avoiding having anything to do with it and deciding to give up drinking blood in honour of her birthday is just making her cranky. And nobody likes a cranky vampire. Jessica, her best friend since childhood, has been diagnosed with cancer and this leads Betsy to think that maybe converting her friend to become a vampire might be a good idea. With a delegation of European vampires arriving to pay their respects to her, a baby brother to babysit, unexpected guests dropping by and a phone that just won‚Äôt stop ringing she has plenty to keep her occupied. And that‚Äôs before she deals with the zombie in the attic‚Ä¶. The book received reviews from Kliatt, Booklist, and the Daily Mail. =Undead and Uneasy= Undead and Uneasy was published in 2007. In the days leading up The Big Day, Vampire Queen Betsy Taylor seems to have a full house - and the wedding guests have yet to arrive. Along with her human buddies, there's a ghost, a werewolf, and a Fiend crashing at her place. And though her fiance, Vampire King Eric Sinclair, conveniently disappears when the conversation turns to seating charts and flower arrangements, he does manage to make his oh-so-sexy presence known at other moments. Betsy knows the next few weeks won't be smooth sailing - but she never expects just what's in store for her. Cold feet are no surprise, especially with an undead groom. But when Sinclair truly goes missing - and not just to avoid wedding preparations - along with most of her friends and loved ones, Betsy is frantic. Alone and afraid for the fate of everyone she loves, Betsy can't trust anyone as she tries to find them and whoever is behind all the disappearances. And what happens next will shake the foundation of the vampire world forever in the bestselling series that \\"breath(es) new life into conventional vampire lore.\\"* The book received reviews from Kliatt, the Coventry Evening Telegraph, Publishers Weekly, and Booklist. =Undead and Unworthy= This 2008 edition to the series has Betsy Taylor, back to rule the nights as Vampire Queen‚Äì‚Äìand survive the days as a new suburban bride. But it‚Äôs not all marital bliss. Betsy‚Äôs husband, Sinclair, has been perusing The Book of the Dead, Betsy‚Äôs being hounded by a ghost who‚Äôs even more insufferable in death than in life, and a pack of formerly feral vampires has decided to pay an unwelcome visit‚Ä¶ =Undead and Unwelcome= The eighth book in the Undead series was released on June 2, 2009. Betsy Taylor has problems that only a vampire queen/suburban wife could possibly understand. Such as taking the body of her werewolf friend Antonia‚Äîwho died in her service‚Äîto Cape Cod, where she's not sure if the Wyndham werewolves will welcome her with fangs or friendship. Meanwhile, her posse back in St. Paul is sending frantic e-mails alerting Betsy to her half-sister's increasingly erratic behavior. Looks like the devil's daughter is coming into her own‚Äîand raising hell. The book was reviewed by Booklist. =Undead and Unfinished= In the ninth book in the series, Satan wants her daughter Laura (Betsy's half-sister), who is the antichrist, to visit Hell so she could understand her heritage. But Satan says Laura would need Betsy to accompany her. Betsy agrees, but only under the condition that Satan fix things so that Betsy can read the Book of the Dead for more than just a few minutes. Reading it for more than a few minutes at a time drives a person insane. Betsy and Laura visit Hell, which results in a time-travelling journey that reveals the history of Betsy's husband, Sinclair, and has some serious consequences. The book was reviewed by Booklist and was on the Publishers Weekly Bestseller List for July 15, 2010. =Undead and Undermined= Undead and Undermined is the tenth book in the Undead series, by MaryJanice Davidson. It was released on July 5, 2011 and was reviewed by the Library Journal. After her time traveling stint with Laura, Betsy comes back from hell. When she returns home, she's shocked to find that things have been changed. Nick is back and no longer hates her, Jessica is pregnant and Garrett, aka George the Fiend, is alive. While Betsy struggles to accept this new reality, she discovers that an unwelcome guest traveled back with her to the present. Between fighting with her sister the Antichrist and a shoe induced panic attack, she has her hands full. Just when things can't get much worse, she returns to hell to make a deal with the devil herself. =Undead and Unstable= Undead and Unstable was published in 2012. Everyone in Vamp Central is in mourning for Marc, who committed suicide to prevent a disastrous future. There is a heated debate over whether to let him rest in peace or to raise him from the dead. Just when things have reached an impasse, Marc is found lurking around the attic newly undead. While Betsy is dealing with this, a visitor from the future arrives and waits for her to do something, and so does the devil, but she has no idea what either of them wants. Eventually Betsy unintentionally gives both unwelcome visitors what they want, which changes the course of the future. =Undead and Unsure= Betsy's in deep trouble again. Thanks to her, the devil is dead and the Antichrist isn't happy about it. To get her sister to speak to her again, Betsy does what she does best: irritate people. Her sister becomes so exasperated that Betsy gets her way, and makes Laura promise to show up for Thanksgiving. During a late Thanksgiving dinner, Jessica's pregnancy seems less than normal and Laura becomes angry again. Betsy is dragged back to Hell, where Laura abandons her. She is left to figure out how to get the hell out of Hell on her own, which she has no idea how to do. =Undead and Unwary= For Elizabeth Taylor, Queen of the Undead, it's business as usual. When she isn't avoiding going to Hell to become co-ruler or complaining about her life, she's adjusting to things yet again. Marc and Tina are suddenly best friends, Jessica and Dick-Not-Nick are doting new parents, and her vampire husband is paying more attention to his two puppies than her. Eventually, her responsibilities in Hell catch up to her. Hell is still nothing more than a misty void of nothingness, until Betsy runs into a familiar soul or two. Before she knows it, Hell has some semblance of a place again. The new Hell is now a huge mall, complete with a directory and a Macy's. Between coming up with new punishments, like trying on shoes at Payless that never fit, she actually begins to have fun with the job. Just when she's getting into the swing of things, her father makes a reappearance. Betsy gets through things with a little help from her friends, two mischievous babies, and strangely enough, a lawnmower. Hell better watch out, because their new ruler is just getting started. =Undead and UnforgivenUndead and Done= October 24, 2016 Review by http://www.publishersweekly.com/ https://colapublib.overdrive.com/media/2560611 Readers will celebrate the strong conclusion of Davidson's once-groundbreaking blend of humorous women's fiction and paranormal romance in its 12th volume (after Undead and Unforgiven). Betsy, queen of the vampires and shoe-loving ruler of Hell-as- the-Mall-of-America, is determined not to let her half-sister Laura (the self- righteous former Antichrist) set the terms for the vampires' come-out. She asks Fred the mermaid for assistance, which becomes all the more necessary when the Wyndham werewolves decamp nearby, worried about their anonymity. Betsy proves she's a good deal less vapid than given credit for by turning a theological bee in her bonnet into an innovative parole program for some of Hell's most well-behaved denizens, though her constant mental exposition is deservedly and funnily mocked by her hunky consort Sinclair. For those who once loved the series, which has faltered in recent installments, this provides a proper send-off. Agent: Evan Gregory, Ethan Ellenberg Literary.

Initially the logo was the head of Adamantios Korais, until the first party congress.  History  The party participated in the 2007 legislative election in Greece, where it tallied 0,1% of the popular vote, ranking 13th among 21 candidate parties. Its highest percentage was in the first Athens electoral prefecture, where it tallied 544 votes out of 337.000 cast, equaling 0,17%, while its worst percentage was in the prefecture of Pieria, which is the only prefecture where the party fielded no candidates. It also participated in the 2009 European Parliament elections, with an even lower tally of 0,08% of the popular vote, ranking 24th among 27 candidate parties. The results of the 2009 euroelections, considered as catastrophic, led the party to not participate in the 2009 general elections in Greece, held three months later. In the 2010 local elections Liberal Alliance participated through the 'Portokali' (meaning \\"orange\\" colour) movement in Giorgos Kaminis's 'Dikaioma stin poli' coalition, who won the mayorship of Athens. In the May 2012 election to the Hellenic Parliament, Liberal Alliance ran in electoral alliance with Drasi. It won 1.8% of the vote. In the June 2012 election, they additionally joined up with Recreate Greece but with just 1.59% of the votes again did not manage to surpass the 3% electoral threshold. In January 2015, the Liberal Alliance suspended talks about a joint electoral list in the upcoming legislative election with social-liberal To Potami party. The aspired \\"front against the new two-party system of statists\\" did not fail on the \\"serious ideological differences\\" with To Potami, but on the grounds that the participation of Liberal Alliance's president Gregory Vallianatos had reportedly been ruled out by To Potami, which instead decided to team up with Liberal Alliances 2012 partners, Drasi.

It was first published in the 1905 Christmas issue of the magazine Harper's Bazaar, and in book format in June 1906 by Harper and BrothersFacsimile of the original 1st edition. publishing house. Summary It is written in the style of a diary kept by the first woman in the biblical creation story, Eve, and is claimed to be \\"translated from the original MS.\\" The \\"plot\\" of this story is the first- person account of Eve from her creation up to her burial by her mate Adam, including meeting and getting to know him, and exploring the world around her, Eden. The story then jumps 40 years into the future after the Fall and expulsion from Eden. It is one of a series of books Twain wrote concerning the story of Adam and Eve, including Extracts from Adam's Diary, 'That Day In Eden,' 'Eve Speaks,' 'Adam's Soliloquy,' and the 'Autobiography of Eve.' \\"Eve's Diary\\" has a lighter tone than the others in the series, as Eve has a strong appreciation for beauty and love. The book may have been written as a posthumous love-letter to Mark Twain's wife Olivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, just before the story was written. Mark Twain is quoted as saying, \\"'Eve's Diary' is finished ‚Äî I've been waiting for her to speak, but she doesn't say anything more.\\" The story ends with Adam lamenting at Eve's grave, \\"Wheresoever she was, there was Eden.\\" Illustrations The book version of the story was published with 55 illustrations by Lester Ralph, on each left hand page. The illustrations depicted Eve and Adam in their natural settings. The depiction of an unclothed woman was considered pornographic when the book was first released in the United States, and created a controversy around the book. A library in Charlton, Massachusetts banned the book for the depictions of Eve in \\"summer costume.\\" When contacted Twain replied: Two weeks later, after testifying before Congress, he elaborated as reported in the Washington Herald, In a handwritten inscription in the front of at least one copy of the book, he wrote: And in a letter to a friend, Harriett E.

Victoria Hospital (Bangalore Medical College), is the main teaching hospital of the Bangalore Medical College, which forms the only government run medical college in Bengaluru. Bangalore Medical College The hospital moved to its new buildings at Bannerghatta Road in 2001. =Building layout= SJIC consist of twin eight story towers, with a separate facility for library and cathlabs. The emergency rooms are located in the basement with access from Bannerghatta road =Out patient Departments= The hospital caters to approximately 165,000 patients a year and both cardiology, cardio-thoracic and pediatric cardiology OPDs run Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 4 pm. The average patient volume per day is around 1000-1200 OPD visits. =In Patient facilities= There are more than 1150 in patient beds, spread over 8 floors of the two buildings most of them being in general wards and intensive care units and only a few in two private wards. It is considered to be the best cardiology set up in India and Asia and the super specialty training program is considered to be one of the best in India at par with AIIMS cardiology. Expansion to other cities The Kalaburagi campus was opened to public on 24 April 2016 and the Mysuru campus was opened to public on 24 February 2018. Intensive Care Units SJIC has 4 cardiac intensive care units. In total, the cardiology ICU bed numbers around 100 and are well equipped with individual ventilators, touch panel monitors, infusion pumps, powered beds and all necessary ancillary medical equipment. Echo-cardiography lab The echo lab is one of the busiest in the state with an average daily echo turnover of 160 trans-thoracic echo-cardiograms and 10 trans-esophageal echo-cardiograms. Each year around lakhs and lakhs echo is being done, the highest in India and Asia. Interventional work Average interventional cardiology workload ranges between 150 cases a day of which 700-800 cases per month are percutaneous coronary interventions, there are six Philips digital Cath labs, of which one is the only swing Cath lab in the region, enabling large case volumes and more efficient patient care.one cath lab is dedicated Esp for electrophysiology and one for pediatric cardiology. SJICR interventional cardiology includes both adult and pediatric cardiology, and every form of interventional procedure, from primary angioplasty, to septal ablation (Sigwart procedure) is performed on a regular basis. It has the distinction of performing the highest number of percutaneous mitral valvlotomy procedures in the world for stenosis of the mitral valve. Pediatric cardiology in SJIC performs all standard pediatric interventional procedures, including percutaneous closure for Atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect and also the relatively rare procedure of percutaneous closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects. The angioplasty work carried out in hospital is around 32000 per year the highest in India for a government set up. The institute boasts of the latest instruments and for most of the latest procedures in cardiology or Cath Lab, it is the pioneer in India. Post Graduate Programmes SJIC is the only government centre in the state of Karnataka to run post doctoral courses in cardiology and cardio-thoracic surgery. There are presently 21 seats for Doctorate in Medicine (DM) Cardiology and Master Chirurgiae (MCh) Cardio-thoracic surgery every year. These three-year courses are akin to the fellowship courses in cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery in other countries, and are entered to after a three year residency (MD/DNB) in either Medicine or Surgery, and are thus considered \\"Post Doctoral\\" courses or fellowships. These fellowships are much in demand partly in view of the fact that they are the only government sponsored courses in the state and also due to the high patient volume at SJIC which results in a higher degree of interventional experience after having completed the course, and, as such, are determined after an intensely contested all - India level examination conducted by the government of India. The patient load is one of the highest in India and so the choice of most of the post graduate doctorate trainees. In 2008, the number of DM seats was increased to an unprecedented 21 per year and MCh seats to 12 per year, making it one of the largest Super-specialty training courses in India and Asia. Director The present director is Padma Shri Professor C. N. Manjunath, an academic and interventional cardiologist. Manjunath is reported to have been the innovator of a new method of balloon mitral valvuloplasty. His researches have been published in several articles and scientific papers published in peer reviewed national and international journals; PubMed, an online repository of medical data has listed 73 of his articles. He is known to have performed over 26,000 interventional procedures and is credited with the highest number of balloon mitral valvuloplasties using Accura balloon catheter in India. He is associated with Mallige Medical Centre, Bangalore as a consultant and is a member of the Indian Medical Association. He has also served as the president of the Indian College of Cardiology. The Government of Karnataka awarded him the Rajyotsava Prashasti in 1998 and he received the fourth highest Indian civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 2007.

Because if he doesn't, the world will end in six days. This prediction from psychic werewolf Antonia is a lucky diversion for Derik, who has recently become an alpha wolf, and would otherwise likely have gotten into a fight with Michael over alpha status in the Pack, a fight only one of them could have possibly survived. Upon his arrival in Monterey, California, Derik discovers that the reincarnation of Morgan LeFay is a gorgeous but benign medical doctor named Sara Gunn, who has had a string of the most unlikely luck since the day she was born, but has no intention whatsoever to destroy the world. Derik, posing as car mechanic, tries to kill her but fails miserably several times, as do others, namely an odd group calling themselves Arthur's Chosen, whose goal is the resurrection of King Arthur. After realizing he can't possibly kill Sara, and convincing her that her string of luck is not pure coincidence, they team up and visit Doctor Cummings, Sara's mentor, who, as it turns out has known of Sara's predicament since before she was born and who points them towards the lair of the Arthur's Chosen in Salem, Massachusetts. During the trip across the country, Michael tries and succeeds to cajole Sara - who is initially rather not very fond of Derik because he has tried to kill her, but adores his gorgeous body - into sleeping with him by means of several lies and half-truth. Over the next days during the trip, Sara falls under Derik's spell, and when he finally tells her that he has cheated her into sleeping with him, she rejects him at first, but shortly after, they confess their love to each other. Upon arrival in Boston, Mass., they both put off seeking out the Arthur's Chosen, not wanting to end the trip and the romance that has developed between them. Sara however is captured by the Arthur's Chosen shortly after, brought to a warehouse and forced to give them some of her blood, which they need to resurrect King Arthur through Black Magic. Derek barges into the warehouse, after having been warned by Antonia that he will die if he enters the warehouse. The Arthur's Chosen release Sara after draining some of her blood and start working on the resurrection, which they can't finish however, because Derik and Sara interfere. The interrupted spell sets free a demon who immediately starts to kill everyone, and would - as Sara sees in a vision - have extinguished all life on earth. After the demon has killed all of the Arthur's Chosen, he severely wounds Derik, breaking his neck, but is attacked by Sara, who, in another nearly-impossible lucky event kills it by simply kicking it with her foot, thus saving the world. Sara then tends to Derik, who is clinically dead, and tries to reanimate him with CPR. Within minutes, Derik is alive again, and almost completely healed due to his werewolf healing abilities and Sara's magic. Having successfully saved the world, the couple returns to the Wyndham Mansion and is greeted by all Werewolves. After Dinner with Michael and his wife Jeannie, Derik proposes to Sara by simply answering Michael's question of what will happen next with \\"We will marry, and you will give us an RV so we can travel the country\\". Sara, initially reluctant because Derik did not ask her in private first, eventually accepts the proposal. This ends Derik's struggle to prove his alpha status, because he is now married to the most powerful sorceress in the world, more or less cementing his status for everyone to see. It is then also revealed by Antonia that by \\"taking care\\" of Sara, she didn't mean \\"kill\\", but literally \\"keep safe\\", and that Derik was fated to Save the world not by killing Sara but by loving her, and that she couldn't tell him before or he would have screwed it up.

Peter McDermott had the unusual distinction of participation in five All-Ireland final matches in the four years between 1951 and 1954. He played in the 1951, 52 (draw and replay) and 54 finals and refereed the 1953 final. He is also the only man to referee an All-Ireland final both before and after winning one. In the 1960s, he was coach on the Meath team and held this position when Meath won the All-Ireland title in 1967. He is jointly credited with starting the International Compromise Rules Series. McDermott collaborated with Harry Beitzel of Australia to arrange a two-match tour by an Australian Rules side, which played (and defeated) reigning All-Ireland Champions Meath at Croke Park in October 1967 under Gaelic football rules. When the International series started formally in 1984 Peter was manager of the Irish Team.

He currently resides in Montr√©al. Life Born in Longueuil, Quebec, Daoust began his musical studies at the age of seven, studying piano with Alice Vigeant. At sixteen, he produced his first experiments in electroacoustic music when he \\"prepared\\" the family piano in order to create the soundtrack for a friend's 8mm experimental film. At nineteen, Daoust completed his first electronic work: an hour of music for a gestural theater work premiered in Berlin (Germany) as part of an international amateur theater festival. At twenty he entered the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Qu√©bec in Montr√©al, initially in the piano class of Irving Heller and subsequently in the composition class of Gilles Tremblay. After meeting Maurice Blackburn, Daoust entered a training program in film music techniques at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in Montreal. This was followed by an apprenticeship at the Institut international de musique √©lectroacoustique de Bourges, IMEB, from 1974 to 1976. In 1976, he returned to the NFB as a sound designer for three years in the Sound workshop. Together with Marcelle Desch√™nes, Michel Longtin, Philippe M√©nard, Jean Sauvageau, and Pierre Trochu, Daoust founded ACREQ, the Association pour la cr√©ation et la recherche √©lectroacoustiques du Qu√©bec, which he later directed for a period of ten years. In 1981 he was appointed professor at the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Qu√©bec, where he was mandated to develop programs in electroacoustics for both the Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©alMontr√©al branch and the Qu√©bec branch. Since Daoust's official entry into the professional world of music in 1978, he has composed an average of one work per year, in various genres, for diverse occasions, and ensembles. His influences are many and varied: film scores, John Cage, Iannis Xenakis, Mauricio Kagel, Luc Ferrari, Alain Savouret, Karlheinz Stockhausen (Hymnen), Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann, and Ren√© Magritte. He has three children, born in 1978, 1992 and 1998.

The trails were constructed by the Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance (then known as the Backcountry Bicycle Trails Club) and its volunteers; Phase 2 construction was funded by the Seattle Neighborhoods Matching Fund and private donations. Trails span a wide variety of riding styles; they include several learning areas for different skills and techniques, Tqalu Trail a dual interpretive/skills building trail, Fisher Line, a pump track, and an upper practice area near Lakeview Boulevard. More advanced trails include a hillside switchback loop, several jump lines featuring K-line and Nicks Kicks, Zeb's Grotto a trials riding area, an elevated structure section featuring Cyclone and The Octagon Of Death, a rock jumble descent named the Waterfall, and Downhill/Freeride lines including The Offramp, Holy Chute, and Pips Hips.

There is a bus connection to the railway station at Freden. The village was of greater significance in the 18th and 19th centuries because of Glasfabrik Schildhorst, the glassblowing factory there, which produced white and other glass. The abundance of water, timber and minerals, natural resources required for the production of glass, made the site particularly suitable. In the 20th century, however, the industry left, and with it, the prosperity of Schildhorst. All that remains is a sawmill, a cheesemaker and a few traces of the glassblower.

Background and education Riddell was born at 2 Stanhope Place, Loughborough Road, Brixton Heath, London, the son of James Riddell, a photographer, and Isabel (n√©e Young). He was educated privately, became a clerk in a solicitor's office, and qualified as a solicitor himself in 1888, taking top place in his final exams.George Allardice Riddell, 1st and last Baron Riddell. thepeerage.com Career After making a fortune Riddell left the law and went into the newspaper business. By 1903 he was managing director of the News of the World and also owned other newspapers. A close friend and ally of David Lloyd George, he was knighted in 1909, on the recommendation of H. H. Asquith. During the First World War, he liaised between the government and the press and represented the British press barons at the Paris Peace Conference and later peace conferences. For these services he was created a Baronet, of Walton Heath in the County of Surrey, in 1918 and raised to the peerage as Baron Riddell, of Walton Heath in the County of Surrey, in the 1920 New Year Honours. The appointment almost foundered‚Äîhe had been secretly divorced in 1900 and that would have disqualified him in the king's view. Riddell was the author of several books, among them Some Things that Matter (1922),Riddell, George Allardice Riddell. (1922). Some Things That Matter. New York: Reynolds Pub. Co. Lord Riddell's War Diary, 1914‚Äì1918, and Lord Riddell's Intimate Diary of the Peace Conference and After. The professor of history at Brock University, John M. McEwen, considered the War Diary to be the most historically valuable of the three.J. M. McEwen, 'Introduction', in McEwen (ed.), The Riddell Diaries 1908‚Äì1923 (London: The Athlone Press, 1986), p. 2. In the published versions Riddell omitted much sensitive information and in February 1935 the original diaries were deposited in the British Museum \\"to be reserved from the Public use for fifty years\\".McEwen, 'Introduction', p. 3. In 1986 these were edited by McEwen, who included unpublished material that shed new light on political events.McEwen, 'Editor's Note', in McEwen (ed.), Riddell Diaries, p. xiv. A survey of 100 books on this era of British history discovered that nine-tenths of them contained references to Riddell, with the majority quoting from his published works.McEwen (ed.), Riddell Diaries, p. 391. He was not impressed by his contemporary, Winston Churchill. On the other hand, he was a close confidant and financial supporter of David Lloyd George from 1908 to 1922. His perceptive diary led John Grigg to say he was \\"the nearest equivalent to a Boswell in Lloyd George's life\\". In the summer of 1917, during Lloyd George's first year as prime minister, Riddell assessed his personality: > His energy, capacity for work, and power of recuperation are remarkable. He > has an extraordinary memory, imagination, and the art of getting at the root > of a matter....He is not afraid of responsibility, and has no respect for > tradition or convention. He is always ready to examine, scrap or revise > established theories and practices. These qualities give him unlimited > confidence in himself.... He is one of the craftiest of men, and his > extraordinary charm of manner not only wins him friends, but does much to > soften the asperities of his opponents and enemies. He is full of humour and > a born actor....He has an instinctive power of divining the thoughts and > intentions of people with whom he is conversing. His chief defects are: (1) > Lack of appreciation of existing institutions, organisations, and stolid, > dull people...their ways are not his ways and their methods are not his > methods. (2) Fondness for a grandiose scheme in preference to an attempt to > improve existing machinery. (3) Disregard of difficulties in carrying out > big projects...he is not a man of detail.Grigg, John (2002). \\"Lloyd George's > Boswell\\" in Lloyd George: war leader, 1916‚Äì1918. Penguin Books. pp. 216‚Äì25, > quote at pp. 220‚Äì21. . Personal life Riddell was twice married: #Firstly, to Grace Edith Williams in 1888, marriage ended in divorce in 1900. #Secondly to his cousin Annie Molison Allardice, in 1900. Riddell kept his divorce secret, until the publisher Sir Hedley Le Bas revealed it in 1915. At the time the social stigma attached to his divorce, where legally he was the guilty party, would have ruled out his elevation to the peerage in 1920. Lloyd George insisted, with press magnates, against the king's wishes. The award of the barony broke through a significant parliamentary convention. Dying on 5 December 1934, aged 69, Riddell was childless, and his baronetcy and barony became extinct. FootnotesReferences * Obituary, The Times, 6 December 1934 * McEwen, John M. ed.

Paul Dolden began his career at age 16 as a professional electric guitarist, violinist, and cellist. Since age 29 he has won over twenty international awards for his music which is performed in both Europe and North America. His approach to audio technology is to use it as a platform to launch otherwise impossible musical performances, thereby making his computer behave like a virtual orchestra. His compositions are characterised by a maximalist aesthetic in which hundreds of digitally recorded instrumental and vocal performances are combined in multiple layers. Dolden's early works employed a unified approach to timbral and harmonic variation, but under the influence of postmodernism, his concerns shifted to include the juxtaposition and superimposition of disparate musical styles. His Resonance Cycle of works (1992‚Äì96) are an example of this. In his Twilight Cycle Dolden investigated contemporary new music-melody and dance rhythms, genres not normally associated with electroacoustic music.

He was born and lives in Montr√©al, Canada. Dufort has a bachelor's degree in electroacoustic music composition from the Universit√© de Montr√©al as well as a master's degree from the Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, where he received a first prize with distinction. But university studies have not altered his iconoclasm and originality: his passion for electronic music and his love of cinema, painting and contemporary dance lead him to incorporate elements in his composition that are drawn from beyond music. He currently divides his time between composing for the Marie Chouinard contemporary dance company (he composed the music for the choreography of Le cri du monde, which premiered in Toronto on March 21, 2000), his work with the artistic committee of ACREQ, and the creation of hybrid and unbridled musical experimentation. His works have been presented in Montr√©al and in Europe, especially in France. In 1996 he won the First Jury Prize at the fifth Concours international √©lectro-vid√©o clip organized by ACREQ for his work entitled Vulvatron 2000 (1994). In 1997, he received First Prize from the SOCAN Foundation for Concept 2018957 (1995) and was a finalist at the Concours international Noroit-L√©once Petitot in Arras, France.

Jacobs was the ninth comic book in the Blake and Mortimer series. It appeared in book format in 1962. Plot In the foyer of a Paris hotel, Mortimer joins up with his friend Blake to deliver startling news: his old adversary, Dr. Miloch, recently deceased from radiation poisoning, has bequeathed him a scientific discovery, hidden inside a house in La Roche-Guyon. Because Blake has to depart on urgent business, and his curiosity getting the better of him, Mortimer departs for the house by himself. Once inside the house, he reads a letter Miloch has left him, to learn to his astonishment that Miloch has built a chronoscaphe for Mortimer to use and keep! Despite his skepticism, Mortimer follows the instructions in the letter and finally discovers the time machine in Miloch's old laboratory in the house's basement crypt. A taped recording of Miloch's voice gives him instructions of how to use the time machine, and once inside, Mortimer activates the device, which stuns him into unconsciousness as it takes off with gut-wrenching velocity. When Mortimer comes to, he finds himself in a strange swampland, and beholding a nearby Williamsonia concludes correctly that Miloch has sabotaged the time machine to strand Mortimer in time. Mortimer narrowly escapes the dangers of the prehistoric swamp and into the future, where he finds himself inside the castle which is connected to Miloch's house via a secret passage, witnessing a violent peasant revolt against the tyrannical lord, Baron Gui de La Roche. After accidentally stumbling into the baron's throne room, he is accused as an accomplice of the rebels; fleeing the baron's men, he encounters the baron's daughter, Agnes de La Roche, before the two witness the rebels storming the castle thanks to the actions of a treacherous servant. Mortimer challenges the rebels' leader, Jacques Bonhomme, to unarmed single combat for safe conduct for himself and Agnes, and defeats him. But when Bonhomme proves a sore loser and sets his underlings against Mortimer and Agnes, Mortimer just barely buys enough time to enable Agnes' escape and reactivate the time machine before the peasants can get their hands on him. The next time Mortimer stops the chronoscaphe, he finds himself in the ruined remains of a modern underground city destroyed in an apocalyptic war. Straying through the ruins and nearly succumbing to starvation and exhaustion, he eventually finds himself in the hands of yet another band of rebels. As he learns from their leader, Doctor Focas, the year is now 5060 and the Earth has been devastated by a worldwide nuclear war three thousand years ago and most of humanity reverted to barbarism. However, a tyranny system eventually established itself from a remnant of civilization, rising to supreme power over the world and attempting to completely subjugate humanity as a slave race under its rule. A rebel movement has arisen despite the strict surveillance of public life and allied itself with human colonies spread all over the solar system, and Mortimer's accidental arrival in the future inadvertently \\"confirmed\\" a prophecy that a red-bearded liberator would one day appear to cast down the tyranny and lead the oppressed to freedom. After hearing all these startling facts, Mortimer pledges his assistance to Focas and with his aid reactivates an old nuclear plant to produce miniaturized nuclear grenades to combat the tyrant's forces. But unknown to them, Focas' second in command, Krishma, is a traitor and secret spy for the tyrant. Eventually, Focas is captured and hypnotized by the tyrant's minions, and Krishma prepares his final steps to defeat the rebel movement from within by luring the rebels to their elimination. However, after noticing Focas' peculiar behavior (stemming from his brainwashing), Mortimer quickly smells treason and exposes Krishma's true allegiance. When the tyrant's robots attack, Krishma is accidentally killed by them, which releases Focas from his mind control. After Focas urging Mortimer to don a protective suit previously worn by Krishma, the two manage to secure the retreat of their men into the underground. As the rebels' allies move in from space to bring down the tyrant, he unleashes his ultimate weapon, a living lava monster, at Mortimer and Focas. Barely evading the monster, Mortimer lures it into the reactor and sets it to overload, destroying both. Cut off from the surface, he returns to the time machine, and after a last farewell to Focas, he departs for the past. But as Mortimer travels back, he finds that the acceleration does not affect him anymore due to his protective suit, and thus he manages to stop the time machine a few weeks before his departure from the present. He finds himself back at Miloch's laboratory, which is still intact at that point, and witnesses the then-living Miloch sabotaging the chronoscaphe's controls and preparing his trap for Mortimer. Acting upon his findings, Mortimer fixes the device and starts it for his journey back to the present. But as he arrives several days afterwards - to a point where Blake has since begun searching for his missing friend - an explosive booby trap left by Miloch as a final insurance destroys the chronoscaphe and the laboratory, though Mortimer ultimately survives because of his suit. After conferring with Mortimer, Blake announces that the government will keep the details to the case confidential, especially since the public is already ripe with rumors about Mortimer's mysterious disappearance. Picking up a plot element from the story's beginning where two men were discussing their respective views of the past and future, Mortimer concludes the episode with a good-natured remark about how the future might see the 20th century as the true \\"good old times\\". Jacobs' view of the future Like many at the time, Jacobs imagined a future where nuclear war is a matter of \\"when\\" rather than \\"if\\", but he also makes passing comments on how things vary with time: *one such variation is spelling: while exploring an abandoned underground railway of the future, Mortimer notices a panel with the words: \\"Stassion 3 Direcsion Pari Santre\\", which in today's French would be \\"Station 3 Direction Paris Centre\\"; *a map indicates that at some stage Europe becomes the Eta Uni DEurope √© de M√©diteran√© (\\"√âtats-Unis d'Europe et de M√©diterran√©e\\") and that the Adriatic and the Mediterranean have become land masses; *Africa itself becomes the Eta Uni Dafrik, with a large ocean in the middle of the Sahara; *a newspaper-like article from the 22nd century erroneously credits Mortimer with the creation of the Telecephaloscope, a device actually created by Doctor Septimus, whom he had met in a previous adventure, The Yellow \\"M\\". Trivia *It is the only volume so far that does not feature Colonel Olrik. *In Mortimer's prehistoric sojourn sequence, he has a series of rather anachronistic encounters with the local fauna: Meganeura from the Carboniferous period; a Plateosaurus from the Late Triassic; and an Elasmosaurus (additionally notwithstanding that this is a marine dinosaur, not a swampdweller), Pteranodons and a Tyrannosaurus rex from the Late Cretaceous.

Many of his books highlight the achievements of African Americans and cover the history and culture of Africa and the African-American experience. His work also included many biographical subjects, ranging from Hank Aaron to Scatman Crothers and Malcolm X. Most of his writings were for young people. He wrote on a great variety of subjects that introduced young people to the language and cultures of other countries, especially Africa. Biography Haskins was born in Demopolis, Alabama, and spent his childhood in a household with many children. He received his high school education in Boston, Massachusetts.Watkins, Mel. \\"James Haskins, an Author on Black History, Dies at 63,\\" New York Times (July 11, 2005). Accessed Apr. 28, 2009.

After graduation, before he decided to become a teacher, Haskins moved to New York City and worked as a stock trader on Wall Street. He taught music and special education classes in Harlem. His first book, Diary of a Harlem Schoolteacher, was a result of his experience. He was a professor of English at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and lived in New York City. Haskins died in 2005 of complications from emphysema. =Writing= Haskins' picture books, with many brightly colored pictures and few words, were geared to young children just learning to read. They tend to highlight the achievements of African Americans in society. The characters in his stories cover the gamut of African American role models, from Rosa Parks to the black members of the Hannibal Guards, a military organization in Pittsburgh during the Civil War.Children's Literature: Meet Authors & Illustrators Haskins' 1977 picture book The Cotton Club, featuring gangsters, jilted love, and pre- prohibition gangsters, was used as inspiration for the 1984 film of the same name. In 1998 his young adult book African American Entrepreneurs was published by Jossey-Bass in English. The book followed the success of his first work, Voodoo and Hoodoo: The Craft as Revealed by Traditional Practitioners, which was published some twenty years prior. Awards Haskins won many awards for his work. Several of his books won the Coretta Scott King Award including The Story of Stevie Wonder, which won the award in 1976; and Lena Horne, which won the same award in 1984. Bricktop was chosen by the English-Speaking Union to be a Book-Across-the-Sea in 1983. Black Music in America won the 1988 Carter G. Woodson Book Award of the National Council for the Social Studies.

After the Russian Revolution (1917) she directed a highly innovative nursery school run on psychoanalytic principles.  Early life  Her parents were both physicians. She was particularly attached to her mother, Elisaveta Yanitska√Øa, who treated children suffering from neurological disorders. Vera was later to say that her mother had a determining influence on her choice of career. She attended the Kiev Women's Educational Institute for three years from 1913 to 1916 where she received training in the methods of Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr√∂bel. In 1913 she met and married Otto Schmidt who was to become a renowned scientist and Arctic explorer. By the outbreak of the revolution, they had both developed an interest in psychoanalysis and Vera, who spoke German, had read Sigmund Freud in the original. A supporter of the revolution, Otto Schmidt rose to positions of power and influence in the new Soviet regime becoming a member of a number of People's Commissariats including Narkompros (Narodnyi Komissariat Prosvescheniya, or the People's Commissariat for Education) and he was also employed as the director of the State Publishing House (Gosizdat) from 1921-1924. In this capacity, he was engaged in the publication of works by Freud and his daughter, Anna Freud.  Psychoanalysis in Soviet Russia  In 1921 the Narkompros established the Russian Psychoanalytical Society in Moscow, a body that later came to contain, among others, figures like Alexander Luria, who, after the revolution, at only nineteen, was a leader of the Kazan Psychoanalytical Circle, and Mosche Wulff (Moshe Woolf) (1878-1971) who had promoted psychoanalysis during the pre- revolutionary \\"Silver Age\\". The President of the Society was Ivan Ermakov who edited a nine-volume series of Freud's work in Russian. He later became known for his Freudian literary criticism of Alexander Pushkin and Nikolai Gogol. Otto Schmidt, in the meantime, became vice-president of the coordinating committee of the Moscow Psychoanalytic Society and the state-backed, Psychoanalytic Institute which was headed by Ermakov.  The Detski Dom Laboratory  He was also officially responsible for the Detski Dom (\\"Children's Home\\", a Russian term for orphanage) which opened in May 1921 in the center of Moscow and shared with the Psychoanalytic Institute the magnificent Art Nouveau building in Malaya Nikitskaya Street designed by Fyodor Schechtel (August 7, 1859 - July 7, 1926). This was the former home of Stepan Ryabushinsky a rich merchant and chair of the stock exchange who left Russia after the revolution. Although Ivan Ermakov, president of the Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, was nominally in charge of the home, it was run by Vera Schmidt assisted initially by fifty-one staff members, among whom was Mosche Wulff and the prominent psychoanalyst, Sabina Spielrein. She, along with Luria, joined the Russian Psychoanalytical Society in 1923 having formerly been a member of the Swiss Psychoanalytical Society and was one of only a few trained psychoanalysts in Soviet Russia. A historian of the psychoanalytical movement in the early years of the Soviet Union described how the home was funded. He also indicated the elite familial background of the children who attended it. Later, that Party elite came to be known as the nomenklatura. > \\"The Detski Dom was funded partly by the State partly by the share in > profits from Freud's publications in Russian, partly by international > support from a German Trade Union.

In fact, it was an > elite institution supported by the officials to keep their children in hard > times. Luria recalled orally that among these children was the son of Stalin > (Vasilii, born in 1921).\\"Etkind, A. (1997) Eros of the impossible: the > history of psychoanalysis in Russia. Boulder, Colo. ; Oxford, Westview Press Vera Schmidt's own son, Vladimir, whose nickname was Wolik, also attended the Detski Dom and she recorded his, as well as the other children's activities, in journal. These were used as data regarding children's development by other Soviet psychologists such as Luria.Luriia, A. R. and L. S. Vygotsky (1992). \\"Ape, primitive man, and child: essays in the history of behavior\\". New York, Harvester Wheatsheaf. The Detski Dom was virtually unique in its principles and practices and above all in its psychoanalytic approach. It was visited by several western Marxist psychoanalysts like Anna M√§nchen-Helfen (1902-1991) and Annie Reich (1902-1971) together with her husband, Wilhelm Reich. Due to the German Trade union's financial support, the home also became known as the Solidarity International Laboratory Home. When that support ended, financial problems, together with internal dissension weakened the organisation of the Detski Dom which also came under external pressure as the psychoanalytic approach came under attack from supporters of Joseph Stalin due to its association with his rival for power, Leon Trotsky. Associated with the rise of Stalin and the Communist Party's turn away from psychoanalysis was the new science of childhood named pedology which was promoted by Aron Zalkind (1888‚Äì1936) a former adherent of psychoanalysis but now its leading critic. In early 1923 the Schmidts went to Vienna, where they met Freud. They discussed with him the children's Home and the activities of the psychoanalytic movement in Russia. They also met other analysts, such as Otto Rank and Karl Abraham. Discussions focused mainly on psychoanalysis and the organization of the collective educational system. Following their visit, the Russian Psychoanalytic Association, became an associate member of the International Psychoanalytic Association (IPA) in 1924 and later in 1927, Vera Schmidt became its secretary. In this year also, her book Psychoanalytical Education in Soviet Russia was published in Germany at Leipzig by the International Psychoanalytical Publishing House. This book was based on her experiences and observations in the Detski Dom and it was cited extensively by Wilhelm Reich. On August 14, 1925, the Narkompros (Ministry of Public Education) closed the home and the building was later to become Gorky's home and later, the Gorky Museum. In an ironic turn of events, Stalin's son, Vasilii, Vasily Dzhugashvili occupied the site of his former nursery after Gorky's death.  Last years  In 1930, after the Russian Psychoanalytical Society was dissolved she worked at the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences Experimental Institute of Defectology. The research carried out there was under the direction of Lev Vygotsky since its foundation in 1929. Vera Schmidt died at the age of 48 years while being operated on for a thyroid tumor to treat Graves' disease.

The game featured the #3 Arizona Rattlers (8-4) of the American Conference against the #1 Orlando Predators (11-1) of the National Conference. The Rattlers were making their first ArenaBowl appearance in their three-year history, while the Predators were in their second ArenaBowl in their four years in the league (having lost to the Detroit Drive in ArenaBowl VI). Arena Bowl VIII was the first to use a roman numeral in its name (a la the Super Bowl); all previous games used a shortened version of the year in which it was played (such as ArenaBowl '93). Game summary In the first quarter, Orlando struck first with Ben Bennett completing a 5-yard TD pass to Alex Shell, while Arizona responded with Sherdrick Bonner completing a 33-yard touchdown pass to Cedric Tillman. The Predators wrapped up the first quarter with Jorge Cimadevilla making a 24-yard Field Goal. In the second quarter, the Rattlers took the lead with Bonner completing a 6-yard TD pass to Calvin \\"Shakes\\" Schexnayder, but the Predators retook the lead with Bennett and Shell hooking up again on a 42-yard touchdown pass. Arizona regained the lead before halftime with Luis Zendejas kicking two field goals, a 23-yarder and a 40-yarder. In the third quarter, the Rattlers increased its lead with Bonner's 2-yard touchdown pass to Milton Vaughn; Orlando responded with Bennett's 38-yard touchdown pass to Herkie Walls. In the fourth quarter, Arizona added on to its lead with Zendejas kicking a 21-yard field goal, yet the Predators retook the lead with WR-DB Barry Wagner's 4-yard touchdown run. The Rattlers regained the lead with Bonner and Schexnayder hooking up again on a 24-yard touchdown pass, but the following two-point conversion failed. In the final seconds, Bennett threw a deep ball to try to get a touchdown in order to take the lead for good, but it ended up incomplete. With the win, the Arizona Rattlers won their very first ArenaBowl in franchise history.

He played in parts of nine seasons (1928‚Äì36) with the Philadelphia Athletics, Chicago White Sox, Brooklyn Dodgers, and St. Louis Cardinals. He was the American League wins leader in 1929 with the A's. For his career, he compiled a 127‚Äì93 record in 319 appearances, with a 4.38 ERA and 1,002 strikeouts. Earnshaw played on three American League pennant winners with the Athletics, winning the World Series in 1929 and 1930. Born in New York City, Earnshaw grew to be tall and , earning him the nickname \\"Moose\\". He was aggressive, threw hard, and threw strikes. His career covered nine years with a total of 127 victories, and over half of Earnshaw's victories occurred during the A's pennant winning years 1929‚Äì31. He won four World Series games, starting eight games with five being complete games. He struck out 56 batters in 62 innings pitched and had an earn run average for the three Series of 1.58. Connie Mack gave more credit to Earnshaw for the Athletics' 1930 World Series victory over the St. Louis Cardinals than any other player. Earnshaw did not reach the major leagues until he was 28 years old. A graduate of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, he was a pitching star for the minor league Baltimore Orioles when Connie Mack purchased his contract in June 1928. That season, the A's finished second in the American League, 2¬Ω games behind the Yankees. Moose had a record of 7‚Äì7 with a 3.85 ERA and 117 strikeouts in 158 innings pitched. It was in 1929 that Earnshaw and Lefty Grove began to dominate big league hitters. For the next three years, they were the only two pitchers on any one team to win 20 or more games. The 1929 season was George's turn to shine. His 24 victories against 8 losses was the most in the majors, and his 149 strikeouts were second only to teammate Grove in the American League and third in the majors. His fastball being wild at times, Earnshaw's 125 walks were an American League high, but his 3.28 ERA was among the best. By 1936, Earnshaw's career came to an end with the St. Louis Cardinals and old nemesis Pepper Martin. Within a few years, George became a commander in the Navy in World War II. He returned to the majors for two years as a coach for the 1949‚Äì50 Philadelphia Phillies. A better than average hitting pitcher in his 9 year major league career, Earnshaw compiled a .230 batting average (162-for-704) with 61 runs, 3 home runs and 70 RBI. In the A's three consecutive pennants in 1929 ,'30 and '31, he recorded 10, 10 and 13 RBIs respectively. However, in the eight World Series games in which he appeared, he went 0-for-22 with a run scored. On December 1, 1976, Earnshaw died in Little Rock, Arkansas. He currently ranks seventh in Athletics franchise history in winning percentage (.627).

Proceedings of Hyacinthia The Hyacinthia lasted three days. Their details have been passed down to us through the descriptions in Athenaeus and Didymus. The first day was given over to mourning for the death of the hero: sacrifices were offered to the dead, banquets were stark and without pomp or decoration, the sacrificial breads were very plain.http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Greece/WS/en/Hyacinthia.html The second day was one of celebration for his rebirth. The young people played the cithara and the aulos, and sang of the glory of Apollo. Others participated in horse races. Numerous choirs competed in town, singing country songs and dancing. Amyclae was also the location of parades of carts decorated by the girls and women of Sparta. Numerous sacrifices were offered, exclusively goats, with the occasion of the Œ∫ŒøœÄŒØœÇ, kopis, banquets where the citizens invited their friends and relatives. The helots had the right to participate in the celebrations, as did any foreigners: \\"they treat not only their countrymen, but any foreigners who happen by\\" (Athenaeus, IV, 138F). The kopis took place under special tents known as (skƒìna√≠), a characteristic trait of ancient country festivals. The third day is not described in detail, it is possible that it was more solemn, or that mysteries were held. It is also known that for this holiday, the Spartan women wove a chiton ( / chit≈çn, or \\"tunic\\") which is then offered to the god ‚Äî a tradition similar to the peplos offered to Athena at Athens upon the occasion of the Panathenaic Games. The Hyacinthia was a major Spartan holiday. Xenophon, in the Hellenics IV, 5, 11, reports that the Spartans interrupted their campaigns in order to be able to return to Laconia so as to participate. Pausanias writes that they even negotiated a truce especially for this purpose. According to Thucydides, upon the peace of Nicias, Athens, in order to prove its good will towards Sparta, promised to assist at the celebrations.

Jacobs is the sixth comic book in the Blake and Mortimer series. It was first published in Tintin magazine between 6 August 1953 and 3 November 1954 and later appeared in book form in 1956. Plot For some time now London has been terrorized by an enigmatic villain who informs the press in advance of his crimes. He commits daring robberies and leaves behind an \\"M\\" in a yellow circle as a signature. When the Imperial State Crown is stolen from the Tower of London, the Home Office assigns Captain Francis Blake to assist Chief Inspector Glenn Kendall of Scotland Yard. Blake in turn calls in his old friend and housemate, Professor Philip Mortimer, who has been on holiday to Scotland but agrees to return to London to help in the enquiry. Meeting Blake at the Centaur Club, Mortimer is also introduced to some of its regulars: Leslie Macomber, editor of the Daily Mail; Sir Hugh Calvin, judge at the Central Criminal Court; Professor Robert Vernay of the British Medical Association; and Dr Jonathan Septimus of the Psychiatric Institute. Following dinner the group breaks up with Vernay and Septimus electing to walk home. On the way Septimus feels uneasy and calls a taxi, leaving Vernay alone. Shortly afterwards, Vernay is abducted by the Yellow \\"M\\". The following night Macomber is kidnapped from his office at the Daily Mail. In spite of the judge's objections, Kendall insists on staying the night at the Calvin residence as a precaution. This is to no avail: Calvin disappears and Kendall is later found unconscious and with no recollection of what happened‚Äîa common occurrence with those who have confronted the Yellow \\"M\\" head-on. Blake and Mortimer meanwhile receive several messages telling them to stay away from the case and the symbol of the Yellow \\"M\\" even appears on the back of Blake's overcoat. The Yellow \\"M\\" announces that there will be yet another kidnap and the terrified Septimus is convinced that he is next. He agrees with Blake's suggestion that he leave London. Taking a train from King's Cross with two police detectives, their journey is unexpectedly stopped. Blake goes to investigate but, returning to their compartment, discovers Septimus has disappeared. As he and the policemen search the area, their train suddenly collides with the Harwich Express and is derailed. Meanwhile, Mortimer is at the archives of the Daily Mail where, with the help of Mr Stone the archivist, he is conducting his own research into the affair. He comes across the case of The Mega Wave, a book written many years ago by a certain Doctor J. Wade about aspects of the human brain. Wade theorised that a part of the brain, which he called the Mega Wave, could be used to turn people into docile and powerful beings and even be manipulated by others. James Thornley, the publisher, instigated libel action against scathing press articles attacking the book and its conclusions. Macomber, Calvin, Vernay and Septimus were all involved in the court proceedings and Thornley suddenly died of apoplexy when he lost the case. Mortimer goes to the British Museum to find a copy of The Mega Wave only to discover that it has been stolen by the Yellow \\"M\\". He returns home to inform Blake of his discoveries and they agree to look into it further. That night a mysterious masked figure breaks into Blake and Mortimer's house. Awoken, the occupants confront the intruder but he is resistant to bullets and Nasir the manservant is knocked unconscious when he attempts to seize him. The intruder escapes into the night. Blake and Mortimer then discover a listening device hidden in their living room. Later that day Blake receives a letter from Septimus begging him to go to Limehouse Dock where someone will give him vital information regarding the case. It's clearly a trap, but Blake elects to go anyway with Kendall and the police providing discreet support. After Blake has left, Mortimer is visited by Stone from the Daily Mail who has found a copy of The Mega Wave which was sent to the paper for review when first published. Mortimer reads through the complex book and something in it makes him realise that Blake is in terrible danger. At the docks, the Yellow \\"M\\" makes an unsuccessful attempt to kill Blake. The police give chase but, despite being shot at, falling into the river, crashing his car and catching fire, the Yellow \\"M\\" still manages to escape, apparently unharmed. Arriving at the scene by taxi, Mortimer stays on the Yellow \\"M\\"'s trail, following him into the sewers where he finds the mystery man's secret lair. There he comes across an impressive laboratory where he sees none other than Septimus questioning the Yellow \\"M\\" over his recent failures regarding Blake and Mortimer‚Äîwhich he is unable to explain. When the Yellow \\"M\\"'s cumbersome headgear is removed, Mortimer is astonished to recognise his old enemy Olrik, but the man who was once a ruthless adventurer, gang leader and master criminal now appears to be nothing more than a pathetic slave in a state of hypnosis under Septimus' control. Once Olrik has been sent to get some rest, Mortimer confronts Septimus at gunpoint only for the latter to use a spinning disk on his head that hypnotises Mortimer and makes him unconscious. Now prisoner, Mortimer listens as Septimus explains how he was the writer of The Mega Wave (using the pseudonym Wade) and how the theories it put forward were the subject of ridicule by Macomber and Vernay in the press, who saw it as both nonsense and harmful to the public. When his publisher Thornley instigated libel proceedings, Judge Calvin was equally critical, describing it as \\"scientific heresy\\". This resulted in Thornley's death while Septimus, who had defended the book in court without revealing himself as the author, left, gutted, for Sudan. In Africa he met a white madman found wandering the desert and decided to use him as a guinea-pig in order to try out his theories on the Mega Wave and get his revenge. In time he invented a machine called the Telecephaloscope which enables him to gain control over a subject's Mega Wave and thus manipulate them from a distance. He can even see what the subject sees through a TV screen‚Äîthe subject's eyes acting as cameras relating to the brain which passes the images on to the Telecephaloscope. Septimus is still unaware that Pig, the name he gave to his subject, is Olrik, the infamous adventurer, driven almost completely amnesiac due to the events surrounding the mystery of the Great Pyramid. Septimus concedes that he cannot control the subject's subconscious and Mortimer privately theorises that this would explain the Yellow \\"M\\"'s failures regarding him and Blake‚Äîsince events in their confrontations subconsciously reminded Olrik of his past battles with them even if he was not actually aware of it. Using the technology in his lair, Septimus jams the BBC Television signal, announcing that the Yellow \\"M\\" will execute Mortimer in the morning. The officers at Scotland Yard are able to triangulate the source of the signal and begin to search the area. Septimus then proceeds to kidnap a number of prominent Harley Street doctors who are taken prisoner to his hide-out. There he puts on a show of Macomber, Vernay and Calvin, their minds under his control, falling on their knees and \\"begging\\" forgiveness for their attacks on him and his theories. Blake learns about Stone taking to Mortimer a copy of The Mega Wave and guesses that this is what led his friend to Limehouse. A reward is issued for the return of the book and the taxi driver who took Mortimer to the docks finds it in his cab. He gives it to Blake and Kendall. The book includes a dedication and they recognise Septimus' handwriting. Realising that he is the mastermind behind the Yellow \\"M\\", they lead a raid on his house. Septimus is about to kill Mortimer when the latter breaks the doctor's hold over Olrik by repeating the spell cast on him that caused him to lose his memories (Meanwhile, Mortimer remembering the magic phrase of Razek launched Olrik face and destabilized, a \\"For Horus remains\\" ). Suddenly going mad, Olrik turns against Septimus, chases him into the laboratory and uses a machine that vaporises the scientist. Olrik recovers his memories and his personality. He recognises Mortimer and is about to take on his enemy when Blake and the police arrive and he is forced to flee. Septimus' death has also restored Calvin, Vernay and Macomber to normal and the Harley Street doctors are freed. Mortimer hands over to Kendall the stolen Imperial Crown. Blake concludes that although Septimus and his exceptional skills could have led him to be seen as one of the greatest scientists of the age, ego and the desire for revenge diverted him from his original goals and led to his downfall. Thus his death should be seen as a warning to others that science is there to help mankind in general and not serve the tyrannical ambitions of a single individual. Reception The Yellow \\"M\\" is generally regarded as a classic and the cover has achieved iconic status among European comics fans. Connections to other books *In Jacobs' later The Time Trap, Mortimer comes across an article from the 22nd century which erroneously credits him with the creation of Septimus' Telecephaloscope. *In the post-Jacobs books written and drawn by various authors and artists, Chief Inspector Glenn Kendall reappears in both The Francis Blake Affair and The Voronov Plot; the latter also includes Calvin, Vernay and Macomber dining together at the Centaur Club. *In The Strange Encounter, Mortimer mentions the events of the Yellow \\"M\\", Septimus and the Mega Wave as part of explaining the function of a strange alien weapon which also affects the brain. *In 2005 Dargaud published a parody entitled Menaces sur l'Empire (\\"The Empire Under Threat\\") which was a humorous presentation of the adventures of Blake and Mortimer and certainly not part of the canon. One scene included an almost panel-by-panel re-enactment of the Yellow \\"M\\" discreetly breaking into Blake and Mortimer's house. In this case however the heavily disguised intruder turns out to be Mortimer himself, making a desperate attempt to obtain a chicken from the fridge but being thwarted at gunpoint by Nasir who stands by his orders to enforce his master's diet by all means necessary. *In The Septimus Wave, Olrik deals with his experiences under Septimus. Adaptation attempts Several attempts have been made to make films of The Yellow \\"M\\", though none have been successful. Jean Van Hamme, a writer who has written additional \\"Blake and Mortimer\\" adventures, tells of how movie producer Irene Silberman, wife of Serge Silberman, actually filmed a scene for a potential movie which lasted three minutes. Jacobs was present at the screening of this trial and Van Hamme, who was also there, tells of his enthusiasm for the project. However the film never got off the ground and Silberman lost the movie rights to the story.Preface written by Jean van Hamme in a 2002 omnibus edition of The Secret of the Swordfish Spanish director √Ålex de la Iglesia had announced that he was working on an adaptation of the comic to be released around 2010. It had also been said that Hugh Laurie and Kiefer Sutherland will be Blake and Mortimer.Interviewed with √Ålex de la Iglesia in \\"Noches como √©sta\\" However, no news has come of this since then. The story was turned into an animated cartoon as part of the Blake and Mortimer TV series made in the late 1990s.

Background Born Scrope Bernard in Pestel Amberg in New Jersey, he was the sixth and youngest son of Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet and Amelia Offley, daughter of Stephen Offley. In 1818, he succeeded his older brother Thomas as baronet. Bernard-Morland was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1779 and was promoted by seniority to Master of Arts two years later. In 1788, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Laws (DCL). One year later, Bernard-Morland became a member of the College of Laws in London, and in 1795, he was promoted Judge of the Episcopal Court of Durham. In 1811, by Royal Licence, he assumed the surname of Bernard-Morland to inherit the estates of his father-in-law. Career In 1782, Bernard-Morland was appointed Private Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, an office he held until 1787. He was Secretary to the Commission of Enquiry into Public Offices in 1785 and Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland in 1787. Between 1789 and 1792, he was Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. Bernard-Morland entered the British House of Commons for Aylesbury in 1789. He represented the constituency first in the Parliament of Great Britain then in the Parliament of the United Kingdom until 1806. Subsequently, he sat as Member of Parliament for St Mawes until 1808 and again from 1809 to his death in 1830. Family On 26 July 1785, he married Harriett Morland, only daughter of William Morland, at St George's, Hanover Square, in Westminster. They had seven children, five sons and two daughters. Bernard-Morland died at his home in Pall Mall, London, aged 71 and was buried in Great Kimble in Buckinghamshire, where he owned an extensive estate.Victoria History of the County of Buckingham, vol.2 pp.302 & 304 He was succeeded in the baronetcy successively by his third son Francis and then his fourth son Thomas.

LTI System For a linear time-invariant system specified by a transfer matrix, H(s) , a realization is any quadruple of matrices (A,B,C,D) such that H(s) = C(sI-A)^{-1}B+D. = Canonical realizations = Any given transfer function which is strictly proper can easily be transferred into state-space by the following approach (this example is for a 4-dimensional, single-input, single- output system)): Given a transfer function, expand it to reveal all coefficients in both the numerator and denominator. This should result in the following form: : H(s) = \\\\frac{n_{1}s^{3} + n_{2}s^{2} + n_{3}s + n_{4}}{s^{4} + d_{1}s^{3} + d_{2}s^{2} + d_{3}s + d_{4}}. The coefficients can now be inserted directly into the state-space model by the following approach: :\\\\dot{\\\\textbf{x}}(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -d_{1}& -d_{2}& -d_{3}& -d_{4}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1& 0& 0& 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0& 1& 0& 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0& 0& 1& 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\textbf{x}(t) + \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\textbf{u}(t) : \\\\textbf{y}(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} n_{1}& n_{2}& n_{3}& n_{4} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\textbf{x}(t). This state-space realization is called controllable canonical form (also known as phase variable canonical form) because the resulting model is guaranteed to be controllable (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it has the ability to move every state). The transfer function coefficients can also be used to construct another type of canonical form :\\\\dot{\\\\textbf{x}}(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -d_{1}& 1& 0& 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -d_{2}& 0& 1& 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -d_{3}& 0& 0& 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -d_{4}& 0& 0& 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\textbf{x}(t) + \\\\begin{bmatrix} n_{1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ n_{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ n_{3}\\\\\\\\\\\\ n_{4} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\textbf{u}(t) : \\\\textbf{y}(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1& 0& 0& 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\textbf{x}(t). This state-space realization is called observable canonical form because the resulting model is guaranteed to be observable (i.e., because the output exits from a chain of integrators, every state has an effect on the output). General System= D = 0= If we have an input u(t), an output y(t), and a weighting pattern T(t,\\\\sigma) then a realization is any triple of matrices [A(t),B(t),C(t)] such that T(t,\\\\sigma) = C(t) \\\\phi(t,\\\\sigma) B(\\\\sigma) where \\\\phi is the state-transition matrix associated with the realization.

As well as being one of the leading institutional brokers, it is one of the largest private client firms in Ireland. It is a member firm of the Irish Stock Exchange and a SETS participant of the London Stock Exchange. The company has offices in Dublin, London, Galway, Tralee and Cork. It employs over 300 people and sold its 26.2 per cent of the Irish Stock Exchange in 2018.The Irish Times  14 April 2014  Davy takes largest stake in restructured exchange  http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial- services/davy-takes-largest-stake-in-restructured-exchange-1.1761500 Ireland has two large (one of which is Goodbody) and half a dozen medium-sized brokerages. A 2013 report by the Central Bank of Ireland noted the likelihood and possible risks of future mergers among firms. Goodbody is currently owned by Irish financial services firm Fexco, which holds a 51% interest, and by members of Goodbody's management and staff, who own the remaining 49%. In November 2019, the Bank of China reached an agreement with Goodbody to purchase all of its shares for ‚Ç¨155 million. In March 2020, the Bank of Ireland approved the proposed sale. The transaction was then expected to close in early summer 2020, contingent upon additional required regulatory approvals.  History = Goodbody family = The Goodbody family had ventured in milling, tobacco, and manufacturing. In 1807, Robert Goodbody married into the Pim family, who had investments in shipping, insurance, banking, mining, and railways. Robert set up a milling company of his own and fathered five sons, all of whom went on to set up relatively successful businesses. One of those sons, Marcus, married Hannah Perry, daughter of James Perry, a successful businessman with investments in iron, railways, and brewing. Their first child, Robert, went on to found the Goodbody Stockbroking company. Robert originally passed the bar exam, and married into the Pim family, like his grandfather. The Pim family, however, did not like the idea of their daughter marrying a lawyer, so, Goodbody embarked on a career in stockbroking. = The business begins = On 13 November 1874, Goodbody attended a meeting of the Dublin Stock Exchange, and his license to start his business was approved. Two years later, on 26 April 1876, Robert's cousin, Jonathan, joined him to form R&J; Goodbody. = Paths separate = In 1855, Robert departed Ireland for New York City, and R&J; Goodbody was dissolved. Jonathan became partners with Theodore Richard Webb, a fellow Quaker, to create Goodbody & Webb. In New York, Robert partnered with Charles Dow, forming Goodbody, Glynn & Dow. Dow went on to found the Wall Street Journal. By 1891, both men parted ways. Robert started his own firm entitled Robert Goodbody & Co, which became the fifth largest brokerage firm in the United States, before being bought by Merrill Lynch in 1971. = Goodbody & Webb era: 1885‚Äì1976 = Jonathan retired from Goodbody & Webb in 1928, being succeeded by his son, Denis, along with his cousin, Jack Freeman. Denis remained a Dublin Stock Exchange partner until 1970. Freeman was chairman of the Provincial Bank of Ireland, which joined with Munster and Leinster to form Allied Irish Banks. In 1974, Goodbody & Webb became the first Irish firm to open an office in London. = Merger era: 1976‚Äì1990 = Goodbody & Webb merged with Wilkinson & Faulkner and was renamed to Goodbody & Wilkinson. In 1985, the firm merged with Dudgeon, becoming Goodbody Dudgeon. A UK partner, James Capel, purchased a 40% stake in the firm. James Capel was the broking subsidiary of the Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank. In 1990, the company changed names yet again, this time to Goodbody Stockbrokers, following a purchase by AIB Capital Markets. = Goodbody Stockbrokers era: 1990‚Äìpresent = In 2010, Goodbody was acquired by FEXCO for ‚Ç¨24 million. The Financial Times commented that the lowly price tag placed on Ireland‚Äôs oldest stockbroker and \\"one-time bastion of Ireland‚Äôs Protestant business elite\\" was just another measure of the dramatic decline of the Irish economy. Allied Irish Banks were likely to have had to indemnify Fexco, the new majority owners of Goodbody Stockbrokers, against any legal action arising from the firm's boom-time trading. The deal saw the broker‚Äôs own management take a 25 per cent stake in the business. Today, of the original 19th-century brokerage firms, only Goodbody has survived.  Controversies  A Northern Ireland property fund which was launched by Goodbody in 2005 had its value of investments written down to nil in 2009. A solicitor said the fund invested in residential property, even though his client had said she did not want any exposure to residential property. The stockbrokers made ¬£1.1 million in commission from the ¬£27 million put up by investors at the outset. The broker was ridiculed publicly in 2007 after it told its clients to buy an American pharma stock at $3.09 and gave it a price target of $5.70. Less than a week later, it was recommending that the same clients sell the same stock when it was trading at $0.83. In May 2010 the EU began investigating claims that AIB misused state aid by attaching conditions to loan deals, unfairly affecting competition in the Irish stockbroking market but benefiting Goodbody. Awards In the 2011 Extel Survey, Goodbody Stockbrokers took four of the seven awards on offer for Ireland, taking two of the four company awards and two of the three individual awards. In the 2011 Starmine Awards, the Food and Beverage Analyst Liam Igoe, of Goodbody, was ranked sixth in the Top 10 Earnings Estimators in Europe.

Taxonomy  Haustrum haustorium used to be the only species in the genus Haustrum. However, Beu (2004) reclassified a number of New Zealand's whelks, considering species in the genus Lepsiella to be synonymous with the genus Haustrum.  Distribution  This species occurs in New Zealand.  Shell description  Haustrum haustorium adult, showing the callus, and the thin lip A reliable characteristic for distinguishing Haustum haustorium from its congeners is the angle by which the aperture lip inserts on the shell: In Haustrum haustorium the angle is near-perpendicular, whereas in other species the angle is more acute (~45 degrees). Tan (2003) provides the most recent review.  Ecology = Habitat = This rock snail's typical habitat is the mid and lower eulittoral zone of New Zealand's semi-exposed rocky intertidal shores.

The NGK originated in the 17th century from the Dutch Reformed Church of the Netherlands. It has congregations in South Africa, Namibia, Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. It is the largest and most liberal church within South Africa's Dutch Reformed Church tradition, claiming 1.1 million members and 1,626 ordained ministers in 1,162 congregations. The NHK developed as an autonomous reformed church in South Africa during the Great Trek in the late 1850s, because the church in the Cape Colony under British rule did not minister to them. It has congregations in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The GK was formed in 1859 by church members who refused to sing songs from a new hymn book and who were concerned about power being taken away from local church councils. It has congregations in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. It claims 397 congregations.

Inzun Kakiak has led the agency since 2019. History=Background= In 1993 the administrative director of the Service national d'identification et de protection (SNIP) was Admiral Mavua Mudima, who became defence minister in the 1996-1997 Kengo wa Dondo government. In November 1993 Admiral Mavua was replaced by his assistant, Goga wa Dondo, a half-brother of prime minister Kengo wa Dondo. Goga wa Dondo was replaced in November 1995 by his assistant, Atundu. On Tuesday, February 13, 1996, Zaire handed to the Rwandan government rusting artillery pieces, troop carriers, arms and ammunition seized from fleeing Hutu former Rwandan government troops at the end of Rwanda's 1994 genocide. Zairean Defence Minister Admiral Mavua Mudima handed over the weapons in a ceremony near the northwestern Rwandan border with Zaire. The weapons included two 105mm howitzers, one without its barrel, four anti- aircraft guns and six dusty French-made armoured personnel carriers with flat tyres and smashed windows. Historically, the intelligence organisation in the DRCongo or Zaire from 1960‚Äì97 was named: * Sur√™t√© Nationale (SN) (National security)-1960-1970 * Centre National de Documentation (CND) (National Documentation Center) - 1970-November 1985 * Agence Nationale de Documentation (AND) (National Documentation Agency) - November 1985-August 1990 * Service National d'Intelligence et de Protection (SNIP) (National Service for Intelligence and Protection) - August 1990 - 1996 * Direction G√©n√©rale de la Sur√™t√© Nationale (DGSN)- 1996 - May 1997 =Formation & early years= The ANR was created in the beginning of 1997 as intelligence service of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL). In May 1997, the agency integrated the premises of the former Service national d'intelligence et de protection (SNIP), which had been renamed Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√ªret√© nationale (DGSN) in 1996. On 16 April 1997 Mudima accompanied by General Baramoto Kpama fled the collapsing Mobutu regime, flying to South Africa aboard Baramoto's private jet.Prunier, From Genocide to Continental War, 136. On 13 December 1997, three former senior Mobutu officers (Admiral Mavua Mudima accompanied by Baramoto Kpama, and Nzimbi Nzale) were briefly detained in South Africa after returning from Kahemba, an area still controlled by UNITA forces and awash with ex-FAZ and Hutu militiamen.Southern Africa Report, May 1998. Mudima was only formally retired from the FARDC in July 2013. Their arrest may have pre-empted a coup attempt. In October 2002, Georges Leta Mangasa, the chairman of ANR, was sentenced to death with other persons in the course of Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila's assassination. Before this, in 2001, the interim president, Joseph Kabila, appointed Kazadi Nyembwe for the chair of the ANR. = Human Rights Violations Accusations = The agency has come under criticism under the tenure of Kalev Mutond (Mutondo). Human Rights Watch has accused it of being \\"instrument of political repression against opposition leaders and human rights and pro-democracy activists during the country‚Äôs protracted political crisis.\\" Specifically they accuse Mutondo of using the organization to repress political dissent in 2016 around the time that then president Joseph Kabila was remaining in office beyond his constitutional limit.

It is part of West Aurora Public School District 129. The school is also referred to as \\"West,\\" and \\"West High,\\".  History  High school classes were first offered in 1867 at Stone School (now defunct). The first graduating class of five students had their commencement in 1870. From 1905 until the 1950s the high school was located in a building on Blackhawk Avenue (so named after the school's athletics mascot). This same building (demolished in February 2015) was Benjamin Franklin Junior High School until the 1970s, when it was sold to Aurora Christian School, which used it as their school building until 2004. The current WAHS structure was built in the early 1950s, and was dedicated in 1953 as \\"West Side Senior High.\\" From 1978‚Äì1981 the building was briefly known as the \\"West Aurora South Campus,\\" when two buildings existed on Aurora's west side to house the high school population. The building formerly known as the \\"West Aurora North Campus\\" now houses the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. The present building has had multiple additions and renovations, with the major additions occurring over four phases. The first added classrooms to an existing two-story classroom wing in the early 1960s. The largest addition, to the north and east sides of the building, added the auditorium, classroom space and other amenities in 1966‚Äì1967. This addition was responsible for the creation of the building's first two courtyard spaces. The 1997‚Äì1998 addition was constructed as a two‚Äìstory wing on the south end of the building, giving it a new facade, and closing a portion of New York Street. This addition included a new library, a technology center, a new cafeteria, and additional classroom space. The most recent addition was completed in time for the 2004‚Äì2005 academic year. This included a new fieldhouse, a new single‚Äìstory classroom wing on the northwest corner of the building, and a new choral rehearsal space. Today West High is a diverse school, with several academic and athletic programs available.  Academics  In 2008, West Aurora had an average composite ACT score of 19.3, and graduated 79.1% of its senior class. West Aurora has not made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, a state test, which with the ACT, are the assessment tools used in Illinois to fulfill the federal No Child Left Behind Act. All four of the student subgroups at West Aurora failed to meet minimum expectations in reading and math, as did the school as a whole.  Athletics  Starting in 2019, West Aurora competes in the Southwest Prairie Conference.\\"West Aurora votes to join Southwest Prairie Conference,\\" Linda Girardi, Aurora Beacon-News, 6 Sept. 2018, visited 7 Sept. 2018 West Aurora previously competed in the DuPage Valley Conference and the Upstate Eight Conference. WAHS is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most interscholastic sports and competitive activities in the state of Illinois. Officially, Chief Blackhawk serves as the mascot for the school. The red and blue logo of the chief is painted on the back of the school's football stadium, as of 2006, replacing the school's WA logo. Use of the \\"Chief\\" character has been controversial for its depiction of a Native American. The school sponsors interscholastic sports teams for young men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. Young men may compete in baseball, football, and wrestling, while young women may compete in badminton, bowling, cheerleading, and softball. While not sponsored by the IHSA, the Athletic Department also sponsors a poms team for young women. The following teams have won their respective IHSA sponsored state tournament or meet: * Basketball (boys): State Champions (1999‚Äì2000) * Tennis (girls): State Champions (1996‚Äì97, 1997‚Äì98) * Track & Field: State Champions (1905‚Äì06) The rivalry between West and East Aurora High School is the second oldest in the state of Illinois. The 1951 Girls' Golf season saw great controversy which nearly resulted in a cancellation of the season. The issue began when a member of the team refused to wear the required uniform, which consisted of a polo shirt with the West Aurora Blackhawks logo and a pleated, knee length skirt. The aforementioned team member arrived for the first tournament at the links wearing a pair of men's golf trousers, stating that if she had worn the required skirt, she would either have to sacrifice a full force swing or her modesty. Wanting to keep his player's femininity as well as their ability strike the ball 200 yards at the same time, the coach came up with the idea of dressing his girls in culottes. These split, pants-like skirts were designed to provide women more freedom to do activities such as gardening, cleaning, bike riding, etc. and still look like one is wearing a skirt.Culottes Music program The West Aurora band program is a member of district nine in the Illinois Music Educators Association (IMEA).

He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Union army during the American Civil War at the Battle of Fort Huger. Stevens and Philemon Beecher Van Trump made the first documented successful climb of Mount Rainier on August 17, 1870. Early life and the Civil War Stevens was born in Newport, Rhode Island on June 9, 1842, the son of Isaac I. Stevens and Margaret Hazard Stevens. In 1854, his father became the first governor of the new Washington Territory and the Stevens family moved to Olympia, Washington. Both father and son volunteered in the Union army during the Civil War and served in the 79th New York Volunteer Infantry. Hazard Stevens was a major and assistant adjutant general. Hazard was wounded and his father, by then a general, was killed in the Battle of Chantilly on September 1, 1862. For his contribution to the capture of Fort Huger, Virginia, on April 19, 1863, Stevens received the Medal of Honor on June 13, 1894.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . pp. 509-510 Stevens was mustered out of the Union Army volunteers on September 19, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Stevens for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from April 2, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on March 12, 1866.Eicher. 2001, p. 758 After the war and the ascent of Mount Rainier After the war, Stevens returned to Washington to care for his widowed mother, working initially for the Oregon Steam Navigation Company and then as a federal revenue collector in 1868. He then met P. B. Van Trump, who was working as the private secretary to Marshall F. Moore, the seventh governor of the territory. Both men were interested in climbing Mount Rainier and on August 17, 1870 they completed the first documented ascent of the mountain. The Stevens Van Trump Historic Monument along the Skyline Trail in Mount Rainier National Park was erected to commemorate the historic first ascent of the mountain. Nearby is Stevens Peak, Stevens Canyon, and Stevens Ridge, each named after him. Stevens joined the bar in 1871, representing the Northern Pacific Railroad Company in their prosecution of lumber theft cases. In 1874, Stevens investigated British claims on the San Juan Islands at the request of President Ulysses S. Grant. Later life Hazard Stevens during his second ascent of Mount Rainier in 1905. In 1874, Stevens moved to Dorchester, Massachusetts near Boston. He then entered the Massachusetts state legislature as a reformer in 1885. He successfully lobbied for the preservation of Boston's Old State House. He was unsuccessful in a run for the United States Congress. In 1887 Stevens was admitted to the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati by right of his descent from Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Lyman. Stevens climbed Mount Rainier a second time in 1905 on a trip organized by The Mazamas, an Oregon mountaineering club. Stevens established the Cloverfields Dairy Farm in Olympia, Washington in 1916. Now on the National Historic Register, the former farm is the site of the present Olympia High School. Later in life, Stevens wrote \\"The Life of Isaac Ingalls Stevens\\", a noted biography of his father in addition to many papers on the Civil War. In 1918, while in frail health, he presided over the ceremonial placement of a memorial marker to Bureau of Indian Affairs agent Andrew Bolon in Klickitat County, Washington and, the following day, suffered a stroke of paralysis.

Description The night auditor typically handles both the duties of the front desk agent and some of the duties of the accounting department. This is necessitated by the fact that most fiscal days close at or around midnight, and the normal workday of the employees in the accounting department does not extend to cover this time of day. Work shifts for night auditors usually run from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. but could vary depending on the hotel, with shifts of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. or midnight to 8 a.m. being common. Work weeks vary by hotel as well, with most hotels having a full-time auditor working five nights a week (typically Sunday through Thursday) and a separate part-time auditor working the other two nights a week (Friday and Saturday). In larger hotels, night auditors may work alongside other nighttime employees such as the night manager, hotel security guards, night porters, telephone attendants, room-service attendants, and bellhops. Some larger hotels have multiple night auditors, while in smaller hotels and motels, the night auditor may work alone or be \\"on-call\\", meaning that once he or she completes running the daily reports, the auditor retires to an area away from the desk but remains available to attend to unexpected requests from guests. In the smallest hotels and some bed and breakfast establishments, the front desk may close entirely overnight. Guests in such facilities are typically given a contact number for an employee or manager, who may be sleeping on the premises or live nearby, for use in case of emergency.  Functions  The night audit itself is an audit of the guest ledger (or front office ledger); that is, the collection of all accounts receivable for currently registered guests. It can also be defined as the collection of all guest folios, the billing receipts for currently registered guests. The purpose of the night auditor includes, but is not limited to, ensuring the accuracy of all financial information and gathering all needed paperwork to complete the audit. This will include pulling any or all checked- out guests' registration cards and making sure guests are checked out in the system. One task of the night auditor is posting the day's room rate and room tax to each guest folio at the close of business, which usually occurs between midnight and 2 o'clock in the morning. Second, the night auditor must ensure the accuracy of charges to the guest folios, verify that the sum of revenues due to accounts receivable from the various departments (e.g., food and beverage, rooms, gift shop) found on the department control sheets equals the sum of the charges made to the guest folios. Front desk function In addition to the accounting function, night auditors may also be required to perform the typical front desk functions during the graveyard shift. These functions include check-in, check-out, reservations, responding to guest complaints, coordinating housekeeping requests, and handling any emergencies that may arise. It is not especially required, but a good habit nonetheless, that the night auditor keep printouts of various reports on paper at the Front Desk (some hotels call these \\"contingency reports\\") in the event that a power outage takes place at a hotel. Night auditors may work alongside a security officer to maintain a level of security during late-night hours for both night staff and guests. In addition to balancing the guest ledger, the night auditor is usually responsible for balancing the city ledger and the advance ledger. The city ledger consists of money owed to the hotel by credit card companies and direct bill accounts. The city ledger also contains house accounts, such as management dry cleaning charges, or local phone call charges which are usually adjusted (written) off at the end of each month. The advance ledger is aptly named because it is a ledger for guests who have sent money in advance to either pay for or guarantee their stay. These funds are posted to the advance ledger when received by the hotel, and then transferred to the guests folio (in the guest ledger) upon arrival of that guest. At some hotels, there are times when reservations are made for the hotel that exceed available inventory of rooms, resulting in an \\"oversold\\" situation. The night auditor is usually the hotel employee that must deal with this if the hotel is still oversold by the time of the night audit shift. If a guest arrives who has an oversold reservation, the auditor ends up having to calm the guest and find them suitable alternate accommodations, preferably nearby, then process the transfer accordingly as per the hotel's standards. This can be a lengthy process depending on the number of affected guests and length of time necessary to find alternate accommodations; having to deal with oversold situations can affect the time it normally takes a night auditor to do the audit, manager reports, and change of day in the hotel's computer system. Other duties Depending on the hotel, some night auditors are asked to perform other functions. Examples include setting up breakfast in the hotel's dining area, delivering express checkout folios to rooms, delivering newspapers to select guests' rooms, laundry, stocking a \\"market\\" area of the lobby where snacks and refreshments are sold to guests, patroling the hotel property (in lieu of the hotel having security guards), and making coffee for guests on an individual basis (or alternately, pots of coffee for a complimentary guest coffee area in the hotel lobby). At times, the night auditor helps tidy up the hotel lobby area (including picking up trash left behind, or glassware and dishes not left in a restaurant or bar by a guest), stocks up employee supplies for the front desk area, or replenishes guest amenity/sundry items given out complimentary at the front desk. At hotels without in-house technical or IT departments, it is up to the night auditor to contact property support for technical assistance during their shift. Due to the nocturnal nature of the position, the night auditor may also be required to handle situations that result from heavy alcohol intake. Examples of these tasks include cleaning up vomit and assisting naked people who have locked themselves out of their room.

It was a twin-engine, high-wing monoplane with a fixed undercarriage. Development The H.P. 54 Harrow was the production version of the earlier Handley Page H.P.51 design, itself a monoplane conversion of the three-engined Handley Page H.P.43 biplane.Barnes 1987, pp. 347‚Äì351. The two monoplanes were both designed by Dr. G.V. Lachmann. Initially Handley Page intended to offer the H.P.51 to Air Ministry specification C.26/31 for a bomber-transport, then saw the H.P.54 as a more likely winner. In the end neither type was a candidate for C.26/31, since in June 1935 the Air Ministry, anxious to expand and modernise the RAF wrote specification B.29/35 around the Harrow, emphasising its bomber role though retaining its transport capability. On 14 August, months before the first Harrow flew, the Ministry put in an order for 100 aircraft.Barnes 1987, p. 372. Powered by Bristol Pegasus X engines of , the first Harrow flew on 10 October 1936 from Radlett. The Harrow was designed to have powered nose and tail turrets, with a manually operated dorsal turret. The nose and dorsal turrets were armed with a single Lewis gun, while the tail turret carried two Lewis guns. (These guns were later replaced by Vickers K machine guns). A bombload of up to could be carried under the cabin floor, with the aircraft being able to carry a single bomb.Lumsden and Heffernan Aeroplane Monthly January 1986, pp. 4‚Äì7. Operational history The first Harrow was delivered to No. 214 Squadron RAF on 13 January 1937, with all 100 delivered by the end of the year, with five bomber squadrons of the RAF being equipped with the Harrow. The Fleet Air Arm ordered 100 Harrows but Handley Page lacked the production capacity to supply them. Despite being fitted with cabin heating by steam boilers using exhaust heat, the Harrow gained a reputation of being a cold and draughty aircraft, owing to the turret design.Mason 1994, pp. 301‚Äì302. As the delivery of more modern bombers increased, the Harrow was phased out as a frontline bomber by the end of 1939 but continued to be used as a transport. 271 Squadron was formed on 1 May 1940 with a mixture of Harrows, Bristol Bombays and impressed civil aircraft.Thetford 1957 pp. 248‚Äì9 While the other aircraft equipping 271 Squadron were replaced by Douglas Dakotas, it retained a flight of Harrows (sometimes nicknamed \\"Sparrows\\" due to their new nose fairings to give a more streamlined fuselage) as transports and ambulance aircraft until the end of the Second World War in Europe. Harrows were used occasionally to operate risky flights between England and Gibraltar, two being lost on this route. Harrows also operated in support of Allied forces in their advance into north-west Europe, evacuating wounded from the Arnhem operation in September 1944.Mondey 1994, pp. 125‚Äì126. Seven Harrows were destroyed by a low level attack by Luftwaffe fighters of JG 26 and JG 54 on Evere airfield as part of Unternehmen Bodenplatte, the German attack on Allied airfields in northwest Europe on 1 January 1945, leaving only five Harrows, which were eventually retired on 25 May 1945. The Harrow also served in a novel operational role at the height of The Blitz against Britain in the winter of 1940‚Äì1941. Six Harrows equipped No. 420 Flight RAF (later No. 93 Squadron RAF) which used lone Harrows to tow Long Aerial Mines (LAM) into the path of enemy bombers. The LAM had an explosive charge on the end of a long cable and the unorthodox tactic was credited with the destruction of 4‚Äì6 German bombers. The experiment was judged of poor value and the planned deployment of Douglas Havocs in the LAM role was cancelled. Nine Harrows were also used by 782 Naval Air Squadron, Fleet Air Arm as transports. After flight refuelling trials, three Harrows were operated by Flight Refuelling Limited and refuelled Short Empire Flying Boats on transatlantic services, two from Gander, Newfoundland and one based in Foynes, Ireland. In 1940, the two aircraft based at Gander were pressed into service with the Royal Canadian Air Force.

It is both the original parish church of Brighton and, after St Helen's Church, Hangleton and St Peter's Church in Preston village, the third oldest surviving building in the city of Brighton and Hove. It is located on high ground at the junction of Church Street and Dyke Road in the city centre, very close to the main shopping areas. Due to its architectural significance the church is a Grade II* listed building. Early history The Domesday Book of 1086 records the presence of a church, valued at ¬£12, in what was then the small fishing village of Bristelmestune. Shortly afterwards, it was granted to the Cluniac priory in nearby Lewes. Although there is no certainty over where this church was located, it is possible that it stood on the site of the present-day St. Nicholas church: although Bristelmestune was located some distance to the south immediately adjacent to the coast, the ground there was marshy and suffered from erosion, and was vulnerable to attacks from invaders. The higher ground of the hill where the present church stands would have been better strategically and defensively, as well as being highly visible to residents of the village and the fishermen at sea. Construction of the present church In its current form, St. Nicholas church dates from the mid-14th century. A font from that period is preserved within the church. It was carved in around 1170 and in 2001 was relocated to a prominent position at the west end of the church - the latest of several moves over the centuries. The church, as originally constructed in the 14th century, consists of a substantial tower at the west end, a chancel and an aisled nave. Early additions include a chantry, dating from the 15th century; these additional chapels were relatively common at that time. A devastating attack from abroad did occur in June 1514, when French raiders landed on the coast and burned the surrounding village (by now known as Brighthelmstone) in its entirety. Only the church, standing some distance inland and above the fire, survived. The church was damaged twice in under two years by severe storms which caused significant destruction and loss of life elsewhere in Brighton, especially in the buildings of the \\"lower town\\" by the coast. The Great Storm of 1703, in November of that year, ripped lead from the roof; a subsequent storm, in August 1705, blew off all of the remaining sheets of lead. A commemorative tablet, dated 1705, was laid in the replacement roof. Later in the 18th century, as Brighton's population began to grow, a series of pews, radiating outwards from the font in the centre, were installed. In the second half of that century, when the town's popularity grew substantially in response to Dr. Russell's advocacy of the medicinal benefits of seawater (and, subsequently, the Prince Regent's patronage), space was so limited that a series of galleries had to be built around the roof of the church, accessed by external staircases. At the time, St. Nicholas was the only Anglican church in Brighton. A model of the interior layout prior to the 1853 reconstruction can be seen today in one corner of the church. Patron of the church The ancient Southover Priory in Lewes was responsible for the church from the end of the 11th century until 1537, when the last prior surrendered it to the Crown. In 1540, it passed to Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex; in 1541, following his death by execution in July 1540, the advowson was granted to Anne of Cleves; and finally, in 1558, the Bishop of Chichester gained it. The holder of that title has been the patron of the church ever since. Rebuilding in 1853 Brighton underwent considerable change during the reign of King George IV (the former Prince Regent) from 1820 to 1830. The town continued to be fashionable, and the number of houses doubled during his 10¬Ω-year reign. Eight chapels of ease had been built by 1830 to alleviate the burden on the overcrowded St Nicholas church, but the latter remained popular as it was free to attend. Furthermore, the administrative vestry of the church (the equivalent of the present-day Church of England parochial church council) was ideologically opposed to the responsibility they faced in raising funds for maintaining the fabric of the church. There were frequent disagreements and clashes with the vicar, Rev. Henry Michell Wagner, and deadlock was often reached over the issue of funding - to such an extent that the church became somewhat dilapidated and some of the windows in the chancel had to be boarded up. The situation was resolved, however, in 1852, when the Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, died. There were historical links between the Duke and both Rev. Wagner and St. Nicholas Church itself: as a child in the 1780s, he studied for a time at an academy in Nile Street (in what is now The Lanes in the city centre) run by Rev. Wagner's grandfather Rev. Henry Michell; he attended St. Nicholas Church, which at the time was under the curacy of Rev. Michell, to worship; and his sons were taught by Rev. Wagner himself for eight years from 1818. Rev. Wagner therefore announced that he would start a fund to pay for the rebuilding of the church as a memorial to the Duke, and donated the first ¬£1,000. Nearly ¬£5,000 more was subsequently raised from public subscriptions and donations. The architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter, associated with the architectural aspects of the Cambridge Movement and Tractarianism, was chosen to rebuild St Nicholas Church, after authorisation was granted on 15 April 1853 for demolition and reconstruction. The project was completed quite rapidly, given the size of the building, by Carpenter and the appointed building firm (Bushby's of Littlehampton): the church was reopened on 8 April 1854, about nine months after work started. Work included a new roof; a doubling of the width of the original aisles, and extensions to some of them; a reduction in the size of the chantry; the creation of an organ-chamber and a new east window; the removal of all galleries and original box-pews; and the moving of the font to a position near the south door, which it occupied until the latest move in 2001. A stone cross was installed to commemorate the Duke of Wellington. Carpenter himself died only a year after the project was completed, and a memorial plaque - now lost - was installed in recognition of his life and works. The reconstruction, which cost ¬£5,769, reduced the capacity of the church by approximately 30% to around 900 because the galleries were removed. Subsequent work Much work was carried out over the next fifty years, mostly in the form of additions to or replacements of existing fixtures; nevertheless, many of the original mediaeval features of the church were either lost or had their impact reduced. Somers Clarke, the clerk of the administrative vestry for 62 years from 1830, donated a new pulpit to the church in 1867, after the original three-deck structure was removed by Carpenter and replaced with a much smaller wooden example. Clarke's pulpit was made of iron. A new organ, costing ¬£500, was installed in 1872, and a new vestry was built between 1876 and 1877 to the north of the chancel. Between 1878 and 1887, a number of stained glass windows were designed and installed. The noted designer Charles Eamer Kempe, a cousin of Thomas Read Kemp, the developer of Brighton's Kemp Town estate, was responsible for many of these; another was donated by Somers Clarke in memory of Rev. Wagner, who had died in 1870. Also during this period, the east window installed by Carpenter was replaced with a Perpendicular-style window. The original window was taken to the relatively new Church of the Annunciation in the Hanover area of the town. A significant alteration was made in 1892, when the whole roof was removed and lifted mechanically in order to create more space internally. The gap was filled with a series of clerestory windows, and various paintings and murals were added to the new internal space painted by Charles Eamer Kempe. The 15th-century chantry chapel underwent another change in 1900. Having been reduced in size in the 1853 redevelopment, it was enlarged again, before being converted into a Lady chapel in 1909. Bells The first peal of bells, ten in total, was presented to the church in 1777 by Thomas Rudhall, a member of one of the most prominent families in the city of Gloucester's 700-year bell-founding history. They were installed in the tower at the west end of the church. Two were given to St. Peter's Church upon its completion in 1828, but a bequest from a former warden of the church in 1892 funded the purchase of two more to replace these. The whole peal was then replaced in 1922 by a new ring of ten bells by Gillett and Johnson. It became traditional for the bells to be rung when important visitors, especially monarchs or other members of the Royal Family, came to the town; a series of tablets preserved at the base of the ringing chamber give details of each \\"special occasion\\" on which the bells were rung for an extended period, such as Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887. More recently, the bells were rung half-muffled for the funeral of Henry Allingham on 30 July 2009. Churchyard St Nicholas Church is surrounded by a graveyard with many old tombs. It has not accepted any new burials for many years, and was landscaped by the council in the mid-20th century, although most of the tombs of significant historical interest were left undisturbed and all of those monuments listed below have Grade II status. The oldest memorial is that of Captain Nicholas Tattersell. He took King Charles II from Shoreham harbour to France in 1651 in Surprise, a coal ship he captained. See here for full details of the King's escape from the Battle of Worcester and his passage to F√©camp in Normandy. Upon King Charles's return to Britain in 1660, he granted Tattersell a pension of ¬£100 per year, and Surprise was transferred into the Royal Navy's fleet and renamed The Royal Escape. John Weiss of John Weiss & Son, the eminent surgical instrument makers, was entombed here in 1843. Weiss had an abiding fear of being buried alive and to ensure his death he devised a metal spike which would penetrate his heart when the lid was lowered on his coffin.http://mortiquarian.com/2010/09/18/mr-weiss-and-his-instrument-of- certain-death/ Phoebe Hessel, a famous 18th- and 19th-century resident of Brighton, is buried close by. She fell in love with a soldier, William Golding, at the age of 15, and disguised herself as a man to enlist alongside him in the British Army after he was sent overseas. The concealment of her sex was so effective that she served for 17 years until voluntarily revealing the truth to her commanding officer's wife and being discharged; even after suffering a wounded arm at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745, she was not discovered during her treatment. She became a well-known figure after moving to Brighton following the death of Golding in the 1760s, and lived to the age of 108‚Äîbeing granted a special pension by the Prince Regent, and travelling in the procession during his coronation as King George IV. Martha Gunn, one of the town's best-known residents in the 18th and 19th centuries, is also buried in the churchyard. She was the most famous of Brighton's dippers, who helped non-swimmers bathe in the sea (using horse-drawn bathing machines) in the decades after Dr. Richard Russell's advice became popular. Dippers had to be of the same sex as their client (or \\"bathee\\"), and Martha Gunn was well regarded for many years by locals and visitors, with her size and strength being a particular advantage in this difficult physical task. Anna Maria Crouch, a noted singer and actress contemporary with Hessel and Gunn, is commemorated by an impressive stone urn. For much of her career, she was associated with the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, taking both singing and speaking parts in various plays. However, her romantic life was also noteworthy: she married a Royal Navy lieutenant in 1785 after a brief elopement in Ireland the previous year, but took an Irish actor and operatic singer, Michael Kelly, as a lover shortly afterwards. Husband, wife and lover lived together for a time in a m√©nage √† trois, but Anna Maria Crouch also had a relationship with the Prince Regent; and when she later moved to London with Kelly, the Prince was a frequent visitor to their house. She died in 1805, at the age of 42. Other people important in the history of Brighton to be buried in the churchyard include Sake Dean Mahomet‚Äîan Indian man who introduced the Indian curry house restaurant to Great Britain as well as establishing \\"shampooing\\" baths in the country,The travels of Dean Mahomet, pp. 148‚Äì149, 155‚Äì156, 160. and was appointed shampooing surgeon to both King George IV and William IV and Amon Wilds, one of the most important architects of the Regency era, who provided Brighton with much Regency architecture. Meanwhile, the actress Dame Flora Robson, noted for a long career on stage, television and film, is commemorated with a memorial stone in the churchyard. She lived in a house in Wykeham Terrace, a short distance from the church, for some years until her death in 1984. The first extension to the churchyard was built in 1824, across Church Street to the north. This has been converted into a playground. Another modest extension was made in 1831, but the most significant change came in 1841 when land to the west of what is now Dyke Road (then named Church Hill) was acquired and used to form a much larger burial ground. This western extension was laid out by Regency architect Amon Henry Wilds and contains a series of burial vaults with Grade II listed status. The church today St Nicholas' Church was listed at Grade II* on 13 October 1952. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Having been Brighton's parish church for several centuries, St Nicholas Church lost this status in 1873 when the Bishop of Chichester reorganised the entire structure of Brighton's parishes. St Peter's Church had been constructed in 1828 as a chapel of ease associated with St Nicholas Church; in 1873, the two were separated and each allocated their own parish, and St Peter's became Brighton's parish church‚Äîperhaps because of its more central location (following the development of the town around it). St Nicholas Church is still widely known as \\"The Mother Church of Brighton\\", though. Sunday services are held at 8.00am and 10.30am, and 20-minute morning and evening prayer sessions are held on every other day of the week. Other activities include a Sunday school, a youth group and regular live music.

It starts off at the Kenilworth Traffic Circle and Kenilworth Access, a mountain-access road at the base of the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) and is a two-way street throughout stretching northward through the city's North End industrial neighbourhood where it then flows underneath the Burlington Street bridge and right into Dofasco's (steel company) Industrial Park. History Dominion Steel Casting Company (Dofasco) established in 1912. Later named Dominion Foundries and Steel, the company merged with its subsidiary, Hamilton Steel Wheel Company in 1917. The name was officially changed to Dofasco Inc. in 1980. In 1912, National Steel Car is established in Hamilton. Builders of reliable freight and passenger train cars and equipment. Also by 1912, with 4.5 miles of dockage, Hamilton is second only to Montreal in shipping. Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of Canada (1919‚Äì1988) was based just east of Kenilworth Avenue North on Burlington Street with neighbouring National Steel Car on its left. Uli's Stairs, connecting Mountain Brow to the Rail Trail Uli's Stairs are stone steps that connect the mountain brow to the Rail Trail. They were made by a local man named Ulrich, otherwise known as Uli. The city sees his steps as a risk to public safety. The city has a set of steps made of steel nearby at the end of Kimberly Drive near Kenilworth Avenue that go from the lower city to the Escarpment Rail Trail and the Bruce Trail, and another set of stairs a few hundred feet east of those connecting the Rail Trail and the Mountain Brow at Margate Avenue. The Bruce Trail cuts through the city along the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) and used by many locals for a full day's hike. The Trail is 430 miles long and starts at Niagara Falls, passes through Hamilton and ends at the Bruce Peninsula. Hikers are led to scenic gorges, hidden waterfalls and places of quiet charm.

Name  The name Jiangnan sizhu (Ê±üÂçó‰∏ùÁ´π pinyin: JiƒÅngn√°n sƒ´zh√∫) is made up of two parts. Jiangnan is the traditional name for the area south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze river in southern Jiangsu, Shanghai, and northern Zhejiang. Sizhu, literally \\"silk and bamboo,\\" refers to string and wind musical instruments, silk being the traditional material from which strings have historically been made in China, and bamboo being the material from which the Chinese flutes such as the dizi and xiao are made. The term sizhu by extension also came to refer to instrumental music in general, especially that played indoors. Other sizhu traditions also exist, particularly along China's southeastern coastal regions of Fujian and Guangdong.  History  The term sizhu is a 20th-century term that refers to the folk ensembles that first appeared in the Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and Qing (1644‚Äì1911/12) dynasties and have continued to the present day. Many regional variants exist, but the most influential has been the Jiangnan sizhu, which in the 19th century became established south of the Yangtze River, especially in the cities of southeast Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang provinces. By the early part of the 20th century, Shanghai had become the centre of sizhu activities; the city's elite organized numerous amateur clubs that played for social functions and for their own entertainment. The Shanghai sizhu became the basis of the modern Chinese orchestra in the mid-20th century.  Instruments  Instruments typically used in Jiangnan sizhu include plucked, bowed, strummed and struck string instruments; flutes and sometimes also mouth organs; and small percussion instruments. The most commonly used instruments are: * Dizi ‚Äì transverse bamboo flute, most commonly with traditional equal distant finger holes which does not produce an equal temperament, although the equal-tempered dizi is standard with professionals * Xiao ‚Äì end-blown bamboo flute, as with the dizi, equal distant finger holes are preferred with the equal-tempered type standard with professionals * Erhu ‚Äì two-string vertical fiddle, standard erhu D4, A4 tuning. A second erhu is sometimes used, known as fanhu (ÂèçËÉ°) or fan erhu (Âèç‰∫åËÉ°), meaning \\"counter fiddle\\" or \\"cross fiddle\\"; it has thicker strings tuned a minor third (B3, F4#) or fourth (A3, E4) below the leading erhu * Pipa ‚Äì pear-shaped lute with four strings, uses standard tuning of A2, D3, E3, A3. Although G2, C3, D3, G3, a whole tone lower, is sometimes used, with other string instruments also tuned a tone lower * Yangqin ‚Äì hammered dulcimer, smaller than the large professional solo type, has range of two octaves and a fifth; D3 to A5 * Sheng ‚Äì free-reed mouth organ, most commonly with 17 pipes * Sanxian ‚Äì plucked lute with three strings, the small \\"southern\\" type is used, tuned to D3, A3, D4. * Qinqin ‚Äì plucked lute, tuned to D3, A3, (optional 3rd string is tuned to D3) * Wooden clapper (guban) and small drum (biqigu, diangu, or huaigu) Several other instruments sometimes are also used: * Zhonghu ‚Äì two-string fiddle, larger and lower pitched than the erhu * Ruan ‚Äì plucked lute with four strings * Liuqin ‚Äì small plucked lute with four strings * Guzheng ‚Äì plucked zither with movable bridges * Pengling ‚Äì a pair of small bells As in an Irish traditional music session, the instrumentation is not fixed, and so may vary according to the musicians who are available for a particular performance. Usually only one of each instrument is used, and an ensemble can range from as few as two to as many as ten or more musicians, with the erhu, dizi or xiao, pipa, and yangqin being the core instruments. Players may sometimes switch instruments between pieces.  Repertoire = Eight Great Pieces = At the centre of the repertory are the Eight Great Pieces (Ba Da Qu, ÂÖ´Â§ßÊõ≤) or Eight Great Famous Pieces (Ba Da Mingqu, ÂÖ´Â§ßÂêçÊõ≤): #Hua San Liu Ëä±‰∏âÂÖ≠ (HuƒÅ SƒÅn Li√π, \\"Ornamented 'Three Six'\\") #Huan Le Ge Ê¨¢‰πêÊ≠å (HuƒÅn L√® Gƒì, \\"Song of Joy\\") #Man Liu Ban ÊÖ¢ÂÖ≠Êùø (M√†n Li√π B«én, \\"Slow 'Six Beats'\\") #San Liu ‰∏âÂÖ≠ (SƒÅn Li√π, \\"Three Six\\") #Si He Ru Yi ÂõõÂêàÂ¶ÇÊÑè (S√¨ H√© R√∫ Y√¨, \\"Four Together as You Wish\\") #Xing Jie Ë°åË°ó (X√≠ng Jiƒì, \\"Walking in the Street\\", \\"Wedding Procession,\\" or \\"Street Procession\\") #Yun Qing ‰∫ëÂ∫Ü (Y√∫n Q√¨ng; \\"Cloud Celebration\\") #Zhong Hua Liu Ban ‰∏≠Ëä±ÂÖ≠Êùø (Zh≈çng HuƒÅ Li√π B«én, \\"Moderately Ornamented 'Six Beats'\\"; also called Ëñ∞È£éÊõ≤ X≈´n Fƒìng Q«î, \\"Warm Breeze Tune\\") (Witzleben p. 61) The repertoire is based on old melodies such as \\"Lao Liu Ban\\" (Old Six Beats), also called \\"Lao Ba Ban\\" (Old Eight Beats), which are elaborated to create new pieces such as \\"Zhong Hua Liu Ban\\" (Moderately Ornamented Six Beats), the latter of which is the most important piece of all the pieces derived from \\"Lao Liu Ban\\" (Old Six Beats) (Jones 276). = Other pieces = These are other pieces that are played by Jiangnan sizhu music clubs. It includes pieces that were originally instrumental solos, music from narrative genres, and sizhu pieces from Jiangnan and other areas. *Zhong Liu Ban (also called Hua Liu Ban, Ëä±ÂÖ≠Êùø) *Kuai Hua Liu Ban (Âø´Ëä±ÂÖ≠Êùø) *Kuai Liu Ban (Âø´ÂÖ≠Êùø; also called Kuai Hua Liu, Âø´Ëä±ÂÖ≠) *Lao Liu Ban (ËÄÅÂÖ≠Êùø) *Man San Liu (ÊÖ¢‰∏âÂÖ≠) *Chun Jiang Hua Yue Ye Êò•Ê±üËä±ÊúàÂ§ú (Ch≈´n JiƒÅng HuƒÅ Yu√® Y√®, \\"Spring River Flower Moon Night\\") adapted from an ancient pipa solo in 1925 by the Datong Music Club. *Deng Yue Jiao Hui ÁÅØÊúà‰∫§Ëæâ (Dƒìng Yu√® JiƒÅo Huƒ´, \\"Lanterns and Moon Exchanging in Brilliance\\"), ensemble piece from the Jiangnan area (Hangzhou) *Han Jiang Can Xue ÂØíÊ±üÊÆãÈõ™ (H√°n JiƒÅng C√°n Xuƒõ, \\"Cold River and Remnants of Snow\\") *Huai Gu ÊÄÄÂè§ (Hu√°i G«î, \\"Thinking of the Past\\"), originally from Fujian Hakka (Kejia) music. *Ni Chang Qu ÈúìË£≥Êõ≤ (N√≠ Ch√°ng Q«î, \\"Rainbow Skirts\\"), ensemble piece from the Jiangnan area, said to be from Hangzhou *Xu Hua Luo ÁµÆËä±ËêΩ (X√π HuƒÅ Lu√≤, \\"Catkin Flowers Falling\\"), derived from Lao Liu Ban. *Yang Ba Qu Èò≥ÂÖ´Êõ≤ (Y√°ng BƒÅ Q«î, \\"Yang Eight Tune\\"), also called Fan Wang Gong Âá°ÂøòÂ∑• or Ê¢µÁéãÂÆ´ (F√†n W√°ng G≈çng, \\"Fa as Mi\\") or Ê¢µÁöáÂÆ´ (F√†n Hu√°ng G≈çng), ensemble piece from the Jiangnan area. The last fast section was arranged by Nie Er into the piece \\"Dance of the Golden Snake.\\" *Zhe Gu Fei ÈπßÈ∏™È£û (Zh√® G≈´ Fƒìi, \\"Flying Partridge\\"), from Hunan, commonly played as a dizi or xiao solo. New Jiangnan sizhu compositions include: *Chun Hui Qu Êò•ÊôñÊõ≤ (Ch≈´n Huƒ´ Q«î, \\"Spring Sun\\") *Hao Jiangnan Â•ΩÊ±üÂçó(H«éo JiƒÅngn√°n, \\"Good Jiangnan\\")  Social context  Jiangnan sizhu is generally considered to be a folk tradition rather than a professional one, and is most often performed by amateurs. It is typically performed in informal gatherings, often at tea houses. By the mid-20th century, it had also entered the curriculum of China's conservatories, where it continues to be performed by large ensembles of traditional instruments in fully scored arrangements.  Notable musicians  In the second half of the 20th century, a quartet from China playing Jiangnan sizhu repertoire as well as newly composed pieces comprised four men: dizi player Lu Chunling (1921‚Äì2018), pipa player Ma Shenglong (È©¨Âú£Èæô, 1934‚Äì2003), yangqin player Zhou Hui (Âë®ÊÉ†, 1922‚Äì2011), and erhu player Zhou Hao (Âë®Áöì, b. 1929). They brought the style to new audiences and performed together for many years.  Related genres  Shanghai opera, which was developed in the mid-20th century, has a musical style and accompaniment that is closely related to Jiangnan sizhu.

Taxonomy According to Heinemann's (1978) popular division of Agaricus, A. augustus belongs to section Arvenses. The system proposed by Wasser (2002) classifies A. augustus within subgenus Flavoagaricus, section Majores, subsection Flavescentes. Moreover, there have been attempts to recognise distinct varieties, namely A. augustus var. augustus Fr., and A. augustus var. perrarus (Schulzer) Bon & Cappelli. The specific epithet augustus is a Latin adjective meaning noble.  Description  The fruiting bodies of Agaricus augustus are large and distinctive agarics. The cap shape is hemispherical during the so-called button stage, and then expands, becoming convex and finally flat, with a diameter of up to . The cap cuticle is dry, and densely covered with concentrically arranged, brown- coloured scales on a white to yellow background. The flesh is thick, firm and white and may discolour yellow when bruised. The gills are crowded and pallid at first, and turn pink then dark brown with maturity. The gills are not attached to the stem ‚Äî they are free. Immature specimens bear a delicate white partial veil with darker-coloured warts, extending from the stem to the cap periphery. The stem is clavate up to tall, and thick. In mature specimens, the partial veil is torn and left behind as a pendulous ring adorning the stem. Above the ring, the stem is white to yellow and smooth. Below, it is covered with numerous small scales. Its flesh is thick, white and sometimes has a narrow central hollow. The stem base extends deeply into the substrate. The mushroom's odour is strong and nutty, of anise or almonds, which can be associated with the presence of benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol. Its taste has been described as not distinctive. Under a microscope, the ellipsoid-shaped spores are seen characteristically large at 7‚Äì10 by 4.5‚Äì6.5 Œºm. The basidia are 4-spored. The spore mass is coloured chocolate-brown. A species initially reported from North America, A. subrufescens closely resembles A. augustus in appearance. However, A. subrufescens produces smaller spores, sized 6‚Äì7.5 by 4‚Äì5 ¬µm. Agaricus augustus spores 1000x =Identification= Agaricus augustus shows a red positive Schaeffer's test reaction. The cap cuticle turns yellow when a 10% potassium hydroxide solution is applied. Toxic lookalikes include Amanitas which stain yellow when bruised or emit bad odor. Habitat Agaricus augustus has a widespread distribution, occurring throughout Europe, North America, North Africa and Asia. This mushroom is found in deciduous and coniferous woods and in gardens and by roadside verges. The fungus is saprotrophic and terrestrial ‚Äî it acquires nutrients from decaying dead organic matter and its fruiting bodies occur on humus-rich soil. The species seems adapted to thriving near human activity, for it also emerges from disturbed ground. Google Books In Europe, A. augustus fruits in late summer and autumn. Edibility The prince under a copper beech at Dumfries House, Ayrshire This mushroom is edible, and is collected widely for consumption in Eurasia, the United States, Canada and some parts of Mexico. A. augustus has been implicated in specifically bioaccumulating the metal cadmium, with a quantity of 2.44 mg per kilogram of fresh weight as recorded in one Swiss study. The same phenomenon is true for other edible species of Agaricus, namely A. arvensis, A. macrosporus and A. silvicola, though quantities may vary greatly depending on species, which part of the fruiting body is analysed, and the level of contamination of the substrate.

It is most prevalent in wet and cool conditions. Symptoms There are various symptoms associated with damping off; these reflect the variety of different pathogenic organisms which can cause the condition. However, all symptoms result in the death of at least some seedlings in any given population.Buczacki, S., and Harris, K., Pests, Diseases and Disorders of Garden Plants, Collins, 1998, pp. 481‚Äì2. Groups of seedlings may die in roughly circular patches, the seedlings sometimes having stem lesions at ground level. Stems of seedlings may also become thin and tough (\\"wire-stem\\") resulting in reduced seedling vigor. Leaf spotting sometimes accompanies other symptoms, as does a grey mold growth on stems and leaves. Roots sometimes rot completely or back to just discolored stumps. Causal agents A number of different fungi and fungi-like organisms cause the symptoms of damping off, including: * Alternaria species. Cause leaf spotting. * Botrytis cinerea also known as \\"grey mould\\". Symptoms caused by this often accompany other symptoms. * Fusarium species. * Macrophomina phaseoli a plant pathogen that causes charcoal rot on many plant species including Zea mays and Pinus elliottii. * Phyllosticta species. Cause leaf spotting. * Phytophthora a genus of plant- damaging oomycetes (water molds), whose member species are capable of causing enormous economic losses on crops worldwide, as well as environmental damage in natural ecosystems. * Pseudomonas species. Cause leaf spotting. * Pythium a genus of parasitic oomycete. Once classified as fungi, and consequently sometimes still treated as such. Along with Rhizoctonia solani, attacks by Pythium are most associated with producing roughly circular patches of dead seedlings. * Rhizoctonia solani a plant pathogenic fungus with a wide host range and worldwide distribution. * Sclerotium rolfsii a corticioid fungus in the family Atheliaceae. It is a facultative plant pathogen and is the causal agent of \\"southern blight\\" disease in crops. * Thielaviopsis a small genus of fungi in the order Microascales. The genus includes several important agricultural pathogens. Prevention corn roots, magnified 0.63X Damping off can be prevented or controlled in several different ways. Sowing seeds in a sterilized growing medium can be effective, although fungal spores may still be introduced to the medium, either on the seeds themselves or after sowing (in water or on the wind). To reduce survival of the pathogens, remove and discard diseased plants, and sterilize containers to remove dust, planting medium, and soil particles in which spores can survive. Maintaining drier conditions with better air circulation helps prevent the spread of the disease, although it can also prevent or slow down germination. Spraying or drenching the soil with a recommended anti-fungal treatment (such as copper oxychloride) also helps suppress the disease. Homemade solutions (including ones made from chamomile tea or garlic) are used by some gardeners for this purpose. In the UK, a copper-based fungicide called Cheshunt compound was widely used by amateur and professional gardeners against damping off, but it was withdrawn from sale in the UK in November 2010 (last legal use 30 Nov 2011). Developed at an Agricultural Research Council Experimental Station in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, UK, it was a mixture of copper sulfate and ammonium carbonate, which could be mixed by the gardener or bought ready- prepared.Coutts, J, Edwards, A, Osborn, A, & Preston, GH, The Complete Book of Gardening, p. 533, Ward Lock, London (1954)  Notes  References  * * * External links * Clothier, Tom.

The screenplay by David Magee and Simon Beaufoy is based on the 1938 novel of the same name by Winifred Watson. Plot Set in London just prior to World War II, the film is about a middle-aged, straitlaced vicar's daughter and governess Guinevere Pettigrew (Frances McDormand), who has been fired from her fourth job. When employment agency head Miss Holt insists that she will not help her, the destitute Miss Pettigrew leaves the office with an assignment intended for a colleague, unaware that flamboyant American singer-actress Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams) wants a social secretary rather than a governess. Arriving at the luxurious apartment where Delysia is staying, Miss Pettigrew quickly discovers that the younger woman is involved with three men: penniless and devoted pianist Michael Pardue, who has just been released from prison; wealthy and controlling Nick Calderelli, who owns the nightclub where she is performing; and young theatre impresario Phil Goldman, who is in a position to cast her in the lead role in a West End play. As she tries to help Delysia sort through her various affairs, Miss Pettigrew is swept up into the world of high society. She is given a makeover by her new employer and, at a fashion show hosted by fashion maven Edythe Dubarry, she meets and feels attracted to lingerie designer Joe Blomfield, who is involved in a tempestuous relationship with Edythe. In the course of twenty-four hours, Guinevere and Delysia become fast friends and help each other achieve their romantic destinies. After a series of complications like those in screwball comedies of the 1930s and 1940s, Delysia and Michael sail for New York aboard the Queen Mary and Miss Pettigrew is found in Victoria Station by Joe, who is convinced that she is the woman for him and has been looking for her all night, and all his life. They leave the station together, arm in arm. Cast * Frances McDormand as Guinevere Pettigrew * Amy Adams as Delysia Lafosse * Lee Pace as Michael Pardue * Tom Payne as Phil Goldman * Mark Strong as Nick Calderelli * Shirley Henderson as Edythe Dubarry * Ciar√°n Hinds as Joe Blomfield * Christina Cole as Charlotte Warren * Stephanie Cole as Miss Holt Production Frances McDormand on location in May 2007. In Miss Pettigrew's Long Trip to Hollywood, a bonus feature on the film's DVD release, Keith Pickering, the son of the author of the original book, Winifred Watson, reveals his mother first sold the film rights to Universal Pictures in 1939. Within the next few years, the studio developed it as a musical to star Billie Burke in the title role but, just before filming was scheduled to begin, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor and the project was shelved. In 1954, Universal renewed the rights, but the property remained undeveloped. When London producer Stephen Garrett discovered the book, he sought out American producer Nellie Bellflower, who had just produced the seven-time Oscar-nominated film Finding Neverland for Harvey Weinstein. Garrett proposed a partnership to get it set up. Bellflower brought the adaptation to executives at Focus Features, but she learned the rights still belonged to Universal which, as the parent company of Focus, allowed them to proceed with the project. Filming locations included the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in Covent Garden, Whitehall Court in Westminster, and Pimlico. Interiors were shot in the Ealing Studios. Critical reception , the film holds a 78% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 150 reviews with an average rating of 6.66 out of 10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Miss Pettigrew is a breezy period comedy carried by the strong performances of Amy Adams and Frances McDormand.\\". On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 63 out of 100, based on 27 reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times called the film \\"an example of how a little nothing of a story can be inflated into a little something of a movie with perfect casting, dexterous tonal manipulation and an astute eye and ear for detail.\\" He praised Amy Adams, saying the \\"screen magic\\" she displays \\"hasn't been this intense since the heyday of Jean Arthur,\\" and he noted Frances McDormand achieved her \\"metamorphosis from glum stoicism to demure radiance with impressive comic understatement.\\" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Ruthe Stein called the film \\"a swell adaptation\\" and added, \\"Frothy and exuberantly entertaining ‚Äì in part because of the sexual innuendoes ‚Äì it's the best romantic comedy so far this year ... Director Bharat Nalluri gives Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day the patina of a film actually made in the 1930s.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety said of the actors, \\"McDormand's performance slowly builds a solid integrity, and contrasts well with Adams' more flamboyant turn, which initially accentuates Delysia's constant role playing but eventually flowers into a gratifyingly full-fledged portrayal of a woman with a past she wishes to escape. Hinds puts real feeling into his work.\\" Box office In its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, the film earned $2,490,942 on 535 screens, ranking No. 11 at the box office. It eventually grossed $12,313,694 in the US and Canada and $4,411,239 in other markets for a total worldwide box office of $16,724,933. Music The film's score was written and conducted by Paul Englishby, for which he won the ASCAP Award in 2009.

It was written in 1951 by the British classical composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. The work comprises three short pieces which are settings of text from two plays by the English playwright William Shakespeare. It is published by Oxford University Press. Composition and first performance Composer Ralph Vaughan Williams In 1951 the British Federation of Music Festivals (of which Vaughan Williams was president) held its annual National Competitive Festival during the Festival of Britain. The festival included a choral competition in which choirs from around the United Kingdom would demonstrate their technical abilities by performing test pieces. Vaughan Williams's associate composer, Cecil Armstrong Gibbs, tried to persuade him to compose a new test piece. Vaughan Williams was reluctant at first, and was of the opinion that the choirs should perform established test pieces rather than introducing a new composition. Disappointed that Vaughan Williams had apparently failed to answer his letter, Armstrong Gibbs appeared to have given up on the idea: The songs were premiered in the Royal Festival Hall on 23 June 1951, conducted by Armstrong Gibbs. Harmonic style Stylistic comparisons have been made with Vaughan Williams's Sixth Symphony which was composed only four years earlier, notably of the second song, The Cloud-Capp'd Towers. Although the published version begins in the key of F# minor, the composer's original holograph was in E minor, which is also the key of the Sixth Symphony. The shifting between E minor and E‚ô≠ minor triads, as heard on the words \\"shall dissolve\\" has been compared to the conclusion of the Epilogue movement of the symphony. Vaughan Williams himself later suggested that the meaning of the symphony's last movement could be summed up in the lines from The Tempest: \\"We are such stuff / As dreams are made on; and our little life / Is rounded with a sleep.\\" Texts The text of each song is derived from plays by William Shakespeare: =Full Fathom Five= The first song is a setting of Ariel's Song to Ferdinand from The Tempest. It refers to Ferdinand's father ‚Äî Alonso, King of Naples ‚Äî who is presumed drowned in a shipwreck and whose body undergoes a magical transformation in the ocean depths. The Tempest, Act 1 scene 2: > Full fathom five thy father lies, > Of his bones are coral made; > Those are pearls that were his eyes: > Nothing of him that doth fade, > But doth suffer a sea-change > Into something rich and strange. > Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell: > Ding-dong. > Hark! now I hear them, ‚Äì ding-dong bell. =The Cloud-Capp'd Towers= The second song also uses lines from The Tempest, spoken by the sorcerer Prospero to conclude the masque at the wedding of his daughter Miranda to Prince Ferdinand. The characters, Prospero announces, will all fade away, and this play within a play itself becomes a metaphor for the transience of real life, the globe symbolising both the World and the Globe Theatre in London. The Tempest, Act IV scene 1 > The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, > The solemn temples, the great globe itself, > Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, > And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, > Leave not a rack behind: We are such stuff > As dreams are made on, and our little life > Is rounded with a sleep. > =Over Hill, Over Dale= Text from A Midsummer Night's Dream forms the basis of the third song, the Fairy's Song to Puck.

(Oran was a Spanish possession at the time, with the right of residency for Jews). Cansino was the fifth in succession of the Cansino family to hold the office of royal interpreter. Upon the death of his brother Aaron in 1633, the office was given by King Philip IV of Spain to Yahob Caportas (whom Graetz identifies with Jacob Sasportas), a member of an influential Jewish family that rivaled the Cansinos. Thereupon Jacob Cansino came to Madrid, petitioned the king for the office in consideration of the services rendered by his family to the government, and obtained the appointment in 1636, with a salary of 25 scudi per month. As a man of letters Jacob Cansino is known for his translation into Castilian of a Hebrew book by Moses Almosnino, under the title Extremas y Grandenzas de Constantinopla, published at Madrid by Francisco Martinez, 1638. The preface includes an extract from the book of the royal secretary, Augustus Maldonatus, enumerating the various offices held by members of the Cansino family, and a letter from King Philip IV in appreciation of their services. Cansino made other trips to Madrid. By 1623 he had secured permission to live as a Jew in Madrid, under the protection of the Count-Duke of Olivares, and with access to the royal palace.Reyre, Dominique, \\"Escenificaci√≥n del deicidio en los autos sacramentales de Calder√≥n\\" (footnote 38), available here He dedicated a book to Olivares. With the fall of the Count from favor in 1646, Cansino was imprisoned, but later released. In 1656 he loaned the Crown 800,000 ducats.‚ÄúAsientos y comercio internacional‚Äù, in Caro Baroja, J., Inquisici√≥n, brujer√≠a y criptojuda√≠smo, Barcelona, Galaxia Gutenberg ‚Äì C√≠rculo de lectores, pp. 53-54, 1996. Quoted in Mercedes Abad Merino, ‚ÄúAqu√≠ hay necessidad de persona capaz en muchas lenguas\\": El oficio de int√©rprete en las √∫ltias fronteras de Castilla\\", available here. In a letter of November 19, 1643 Fray Juan Ponce, a former Holy Office commissioner in Oran, warned the Suprema of the Inquisition of the pending arrival of several Jews from Oran. One of these was Jacob Cansino. Ponce described him as a \\"powerful magician\\" who could mix herbs and powders that subjugated others to his will even if they had only the slightest contact with him. Ponce claimed that Cansino was bringing his potions with him, as well as some anti-Catholic propaganda. The Suprema ordered the Valencia council to expel any of these Jewish travelers who landed without specific royal permission.Haliczer, Stephen, Inquisition and Society in the Kingdom of Valencia, 1478-1834, Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1990, p. 242. Jacob Cansino excited the enmity of the Marquis de Los Veles, governor of Oran, who wished to give the office he held to the husband of one of his favorites. Jacob was too firmly established in his position, however, and remained in office until his death in 1666. In 1668 the Jews were expelled from Oran at the instigation of the governor.

The main building of this truck garage has a semi-circular form, with service workshops and office in a standalone building between the tips of a \\"horseshoe\\". Each of two levels could store 110 trucks; unlike Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage, these had to be parked conventionally, using reverse gear. Each tip of the horseshoe has a V-shaped protrusion with entry and exit gates set at an angle to the street line; this was supposed to simplify entry and exit from a narrow street. This garage is still used as such, and houses Moscow's Fourth Bus Park. However, since modern articulated buses are longer than 1920s trucks, present-day parking arrangement differs from Melnikov's efficient layout.

It was followed by a sequel in 1991, The Terror Within II, with Stevens reprising his starring role while also handling the film's writing and directing duties. Plot In a post-apocalyptic future, human survivors are fighting a group of mutant monsters they refer to as \\"Gargoyles\\". Two of these survivors Michael and John are out surveying the world after a chemical or biological attack which left a large portion of the population mutated or dead. The survivors are part of the Mojave Lab and have lost contact with their sister Rocky Mountain Lab. Over the radio Sue and David hear John and Michael fall under attack from the gargoyles while investigating a large group of buzzards. In order to find John and Michael, David and Sue go out of the bunker but find John and Michael dead. They also find an injured girl named Karen who they bring back to their bunker. While under anesthesia Karen gives birth to a gargoyle which gets loose in the bunker. Hal develops a plan to kill the gargoyle in which Andre and Neil fall prey to the gargoyle. The gargoyle then proceeds to wound David and injure his dog Butch while also kidnapping Sue with the intentions to reproducing with her. These creatures reproduce quickly by raping human women and impregnating them. The gestation period is short and deadly. The creatures are very strong and able to heal after some wounds such as burning, beating, and electrical shock. They are vulnerable to the high-pitched frequency of a dog whistle (used by a lead character to ward them off). Sue becomes impregnated by the gargoyle; she later accidentally kills herself while trying to abort the fetus herself. Linda and David then hatch a plan to kill the gargoyle by luring him into the ventilation system where he becomes trapped and falls into a running exhaust fan dismembering him. David and Linda re-establish radio contact with the Rocky Mountain Lab and along with Butch leave the bunker with a high frequency megaphone to brave the outside world. They lie in wait for a number of gargoyles to enter the open bunker and implode it. Linda and David leave the bunker; it is implied that they are on their way to the Rocky Mountain Lab. Abortion becomes a topic of debate between the humans when one of the characters is raped by one of the creatures; they are unsure if the woman is pregnant by her human partner or the monster.

We're talking 17 dead bodies. No breasts. Snake- eating. Bloody fetus monster. Multiple throat-slashing. Giant gargoyle rape. One self-abortion. Exploding sheds. Exploding gargoyles. Gratuitous monster abortion scene, the best one since It's Alive! Buzzard Fu.

Description The Tuscarora is a thin- to thick-bedded fine-grained to coarse-grained orthoquartzite. It is a white to medium-gray or gray-green subgraywacke, sandstone, siltstone and shale, cross- stratified and conglomeratic conglomerate in parts, containing a few shale interbeds.Berg, T.M., Edmunds, W.E., Geyer, A.R. and others, compilers, (1980). Geologic Map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Map 1, scale 1:250,000. Details of the type locality and of stratigraphic nomenclature for this unit as used by the U.S. Geological Survey are available on-line at the National Geologic Map Database.https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/search The Tuscarora and its lateral equivalents are the primary ridge-formers of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians in the eastern United States It is typically 935 feet thick in Pennsylvania, and in Maryland varies from 60 feet to 400 feet thick from east to west. =Notable exposures= Tuscarora quartzite cliff on the west side of North Fork Mountain in West Virginia. The Tuscarora Formation is commonly exposed on various ridge crests and in many water gaps in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province of the Appalachians of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia, particularly along the Wills Mountain Anticline. In Pennsylvania, the Tuscarora is exposed along US 30 on the north and south sides of the Narrows in central Bedford County, where it is nearly vertical. It is also well-exposed in the core of Jack's Mountain in Jack's Narrows, where the Juniata River cuts through the mountain, just west of Mount Union. The Standing Stone Trail traverses this cut, and many of the \\"Thousand Steps\\" here are Tuscarora quartzite. In Maryland, the National Road (US 40) passes arched Tuscarora sandstone outcrops in the Cumberland Narrows in Allegany County. In West Virginia, the River Knobs along the North Fork of the South Branch of the Potomac River in Pendleton County include dramatic outcrops of nearly vertical Tuscarora sandstone. Some of the better known of these exposures are Seneca Rocks, Champe Rocks, Judy Rocks, and Nelson Rocks. These cliffs are clearly visible along U.S. Route 33 and West Virginia Routes 28 and 55. North Fork Mountain, to the east of the River Knobs, is a long Ridge and Valley anticline ridge capped by Tuscarora sandstone. Two of the more comprehensive exposures of the Tuscarora Formation are in two quarries at the crest and south end of Canoe Mountain (Spruce Creek Quadrangle). Geographic Extent The Tuscarora is present in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, USA.Ryder, R.T., Swezey, C.S., Crangle, R.D., Jr., and Trippi, M.T., 2008, Geologic cross section E-E‚Äô through the central Appalachian Basin from the Findlay Arch, Wood County, Ohio, to the Valley and Ridge Province, Pendleton County, West Virginia: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Map SIM-2985, 2 sheets with 48-page pamphlet. http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sim2985Ryder, R.T., Trippi, M.H., and Swezey, C.S., 2015, Geologic cross section I-I‚Äô through the central Appalachian basin from north-central Kentucky to southwestern Virginia: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Map SIM-3343, 2 sheets with two pamphlets (41p. and 102p.). http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sim3343 Stratigraphic Setting The Tuscarora rests conformably atop the Juniata Formation and conformably below the Clinton Group in Pennsylvania.Berg, T.M., et al., (1983). Stratagraphic Correlation Chart of Pennsylvania: G75, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The Tuscarora is a lateral equivalent of the Minsi and Weiders members of the Shawangunk Formation in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, and of the Massanutten Formation in Virginia, and the Clinch Sandstone farther south. Butts (1940) indicated that in the Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province the name \\"Tuscarora Sandstone\\" should be applied to these strata from Pennsylvania in the north to 38deg N latitude, and that the name \\"Clinch Sandstone\\" should be applied to these strata south of 38deg N latitude.Butts, C., 1940, Geology of the Appalachian Valley in Virginia: Virginia Geological Survey Bulletin 52, pt. 1, 568p. Conformable contact of overlying Tuscarora Formation (white rock, left) with underlying Juniata Formation (red rock, right) at the Narrows along U.S. 30 in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. There is one named member of the formation: Castanea, occurring at the top, leaving the Lower and Middle Tuscarora Formation at the bottom. This formation has been called the \\"White Medina Sandstone\\" in West Virginia. Fossils Sample of Silurian Tuscarora Formation collected from Bald Eagle Mountain, Centre County, Pennsylvania, showing Diplocraterion trace fossil at left. Specimen is ~22cm high. Very few fossils exist in the Tuscarora, and most of them are trace fossils. At least two hughmilleriid Eurypterids (sea scorpions) have been discovered in the Tuscarora.Boucot, A.J., Gray, Jane, and Hoskins, D.M., 1994, New hughmilleriid (Eurypterida) occurrence from the Tuscarora Formation, central Pennsylvania, and its environmental interpretation, IN Landing, Ed, ed., Studies in stratigraphy and paleontology in honor of Donald W. Fisher: New York State Museum Bulletin, no. 481, p. 21-23. Age Relative age dating of the Tuscarora places it in the Lower Silurian period, being deposited between 440 and 417 (¬±10) million years ago. Interpretations of Depositional Environment The depositional environment of the Tuscarora has always been interpreted as mostly terrestrial or shallow marine deposits resulting in a molasse sequence produced by the Taconic orogeny. It is thought to represent a vast sand shoal along the margin of the Iapetus Ocean. Ripple marks are seldom found, but do support interpretation as a shallow marine depositional environment. Economic uses The Tuscarora may have been used as a ganister for making furnace liners in 19th century iron smelting blast furnaces of central Pennsylvania. Seneca Rocks, a dramatic Tuscarora sandstone outcrop in West Virginia (Wood engraving by David H.Strother, 1872) The Tuscarora has become very important to the tourism industry of eastern West Virginia, where the formation has many conspicuous outcrops visible from such roads as U.S. Routes 33 and 50 and West Virginia Routes 28 and 55. Tuscarora-capped North Fork Mountain and various Tuscarora cliffs are prominent in scenic views from such sites as Spruce Knob and Dolly Sods. Seneca Rocks in Pendleton County, West Virginia, has become a world-renowned rock climbing location. It is the only \\"true peak\\" (a peak inaccessible except by technical rock climbing techniques) on the East Coast of the United States. Two climbing schools near the outcrop and many other guide services offer guided climbing trips on the 300+ climbing routes on the west-facing cliff. Seneca Rocks is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, and is located within the Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area of the Monongahela National Forest.

He later introduced a non-symmetric generalization in 1995. Macdonald originally associated his polynomials with weights Œª of finite root systems and used just one variable t, but later realized that it is more natural to associate them with affine root systems rather than finite root systems, in which case the variable t can be replaced by several different variables t=(t1,...,tk), one for each of the k orbits of roots in the affine root system. The Macdonald polynomials are polynomials in n variables x=(x1,...,xn), where n is the rank of the affine root system. They generalize many other families of orthogonal polynomials, such as Jack polynomials and Hall‚ÄìLittlewood polynomials and Askey‚ÄìWilson polynomials, which in turn include most of the named 1-variable orthogonal polynomials as special cases. Koornwinder polynomials are Macdonald polynomials of certain non-reduced root systems. They have deep relationships with affine Hecke algebras and Hilbert schemes, which were used to prove several conjectures made by Macdonald about them. Definition First fix some notation: *R is a finite root system in a real vector space V. *R+ is a choice of positive roots, to which corresponds a positive Weyl chamber. *W is the Weyl group of R. *Q is the root lattice of R (the lattice spanned by the roots). *P is the weight lattice of R (containing Q). * An ordering on the weights: \\\\mu \\\\le \\\\lambda if and only if \\\\lambda-\\\\mu is a nonnegative linear combination of simple roots. *P+ is the set of dominant weights: the elements of P in the positive Weyl chamber. *œÅ is the Weyl vector: half the sum of the positive roots; this is a special element of P+ in the interior of the positive Weyl chamber. *F is a field of characteristic 0, usually the rational numbers. *A = F(P) is the group algebra of P, with a basis of elements written eŒª for Œª ‚àà P. * If f = eŒª, then f means e‚àíŒª, and this is extended by linearity to the whole group algebra. *mŒº = Œ£Œª ‚àà WŒºeŒª is an orbit sum; these elements form a basis for the subalgebra AW of elements fixed by W. *(a;q)_\\\\infty = \\\\prod_{r\\\\ge0}(1-aq^r), the infinite q-Pochhammer symbol. *\\\\Delta= \\\\prod_{\\\\alpha\\\\in R} {(e^\\\\alpha; q)_\\\\infty \\\\over (te^\\\\alpha; q)_\\\\infty}. *\\\\langle f,g\\\\rangle=(\\\\text{constant term of }f \\\\overline g \\\\Delta)/W is the inner product of two elements of A, at least when t is a positive integer power of q. The Macdonald polynomials PŒª for Œª ‚àà P+ are uniquely defined by the following two conditions: :P_\\\\lambda=\\\\sum_{\\\\mu\\\\le \\\\lambda}u_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}m_\\\\mu where uŒªŒº is a rational function of q and t with uŒªŒª = 1; : PŒª and PŒº are orthogonal if Œª < Œº. In other words, the Macdonald polynomials are obtained by orthogonalizing the obvious basis for AW. The existence of polynomials with these properties is easy to show (for any inner product). A key property of the Macdonald polynomials is that they are orthogonal: „ÄàPŒª, PŒº„Äâ = 0 whenever Œª ‚â† Œº. This is not a trivial consequence of the definition because P+ is not totally ordered, and so has plenty of elements that are incomparable. Thus one must check that the corresponding polynomials are still orthogonal. The orthogonality can be proved by showing that the Macdonald polynomials are eigenvectors for an algebra of commuting self-adjoint operators with 1-dimensional eigenspaces, and using the fact that eigenspaces for different eigenvalues must be orthogonal. In the case of non-simply-laced root systems (B, C, F, G), the parameter t can be chosen to vary with the length of the root, giving a three- parameter family of Macdonald polynomials. One can also extend the definition to the nonreduced root system BC, in which case one obtains a six-parameter family (one t for each orbit of roots, plus q) known as Koornwinder polynomials. It is sometimes better to regard Macdonald polynomials as depending on a possibly non-reduced affine root system. In this case, there is one parameter t associated to each orbit of roots in the affine root system, plus one parameter q. The number of orbits of roots can vary from 1 to 5. Examples *If q = t the Macdonald polynomials become the Weyl characters of the representations of the compact group of the root system, or the Schur functions in the case of root systems of type A. *If q = 0 the Macdonald polynomials become the (rescaled) zonal spherical functions for a semisimple p-adic group, or the Hall‚ÄìLittlewood polynomials when the root system has type A. *If t=1 the Macdonald polynomials become the sums over W orbits, which are the monomial symmetric functions when the root system has type A. *If we put t = qŒ± and let q tend to 1 the Macdonald polynomials become Jack polynomials when the root system is of type A, and Heckman‚ÄìOpdam polynomials for more general root systems. *For the affine root system A1, the Macdonald polynomials are the Rogers polynomials. *For the non-reduced rank 1 affine root system of type (C, C1), the Macdonald polynomials are the Askey‚ÄìWilson polynomials, which in turn include as special cases most of the named families of orthogonal polynomials in 1 variable. *For the non-reduced affine root system of type (C, Cn), the Macdonald polynomials are the Koornwinder polynomials. The Macdonald constant term conjecture If t = qk for some positive integer k, then the norm of the Macdonald polynomials is given by :\\\\langle P_\\\\lambda, P_\\\\lambda\\\\rangle = \\\\prod_{\\\\alpha\\\\in R, \\\\alpha>0} \\\\prod_{0 This was conjectured by Macdonald (1982) as a generalization of the Dyson conjecture, and proved for all (reduced) root systems by Cherednik (1995) using properties of double affine Hecke algebras. The conjecture had previously been proved case-by-case for all roots systems except those of type En by several authors. There are two other conjectures which together with the norm conjecture are collectively referred to as the Macdonald conjectures in this context: in addition to the formula for the norm, Macdonald conjectured a formula for the value of PŒª at the point tœÅ, and a symmetry :\\\\frac{P_\\\\lambda(\\\\dots,q^{\\\\mu_i}t^{\\\\rho_i},\\\\dots)}{P_\\\\lambda(t^\\\\rho)} = \\\\frac{P_\\\\mu(\\\\dots,q^{\\\\lambda_i}t^{\\\\rho_i},\\\\dots)}{P_\\\\mu(t^\\\\rho)}. Again, these were proved for general reduced root systems by , using double affine Hecke algebras, with the extension to the BC case following shortly thereafter via work of van Diejen, Noumi, and Sahi. The Macdonald positivity conjecture In the case of roots systems of type An‚àí1 the Macdonald polynomials are simply symmetric polynomials in n variables with coefficients that are rational functions of q and t. A certain transformed version \\\\widetilde{H}_\\\\mu of the Macdonald polynomials (see Combinatorial formula below) form an orthogonal basis of the space of symmetric functions over \\\\mathbb{Q}(q,t), and therefore can be expressed in terms of Schur functions s_\\\\lambda. The coefficients KŒªŒº(q,t) of these relations are called Kostka-Macdonald coefficients or qt- Kostka coefficients. Macdonald conjectured that the Kostka-Macdonald coefficients were polynomials in q and t with non-negative integer coefficients. These conjectures are now proved; the hardest and final step was proving the positivity, which was done by Mark Haiman (2001), by proving the n! conjecture. It is still a central open problem in algebraic combinatorics to find a combinatorial formula for the qt-Kostka coefficients. n! conjecture The n! conjecture of Adriano Garsia and Mark Haiman states that for each partition Œº of n the space :D_\\\\mu =C[\\\\partial x,\\\\partial y]\\\\,\\\\Delta_\\\\mu spanned by all higher partial derivatives of :\\\\Delta_\\\\mu = \\\\det (x_i^{p_j}y_i^{q_j})_{1\\\\le i,j,\\\\le n} has dimension n!, where (pj, qj) run through the n elements of the diagram of the partition Œº, regarded as a subset of the pairs of non-negative integers. For example, if Œº is the partition 3 = 2 + 1 of n = 3 then the pairs (pj, qj) are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and the space DŒº is spanned by :\\\\Delta_\\\\mu=x_1y_2+x_2y_3+x_3y_1-x_2y_1-x_3y_2-x_1y_3 :y_2-y_3 :y_3-y_1 :x_3-x_2 :x_1-x_3 :1 which has dimension 6 = 3!. Haiman's proof of the Macdonald positivity conjecture and the n! conjecture involved showing that the isospectral Hilbert scheme of n points in a plane was Cohen- Macaulay (and even Gorenstein). Earlier results of Haiman and Garsia had already shown that this implied the n! conjecture, and that the n! conjecture implied that the Kostka-Macdonald coefficients were graded character multiplicities for the modules DŒº. This immediately implies the Macdonald positivity conjecture because character multiplicities have to be non-negative integers. Ian Grojnowski and Mark Haiman found another proof of the Macdonald positivity conjecture by proving a positivity conjecture for LLT polynomials. Combinatorial formula for the Macdonald polynomials In 2005, J. Haglund, M. Haiman and N. Loehr gave the first proof of a combinatorial interpretation of the Macdonald polynomials. While very useful for computation and interesting in its own right, this combinatorial formula does not immediately imply positivity of the Kostka-Macdonald coefficients K_{\\\\lambda \\\\mu}(q,t), as it gives the decomposition of the Macdonald polynomials into monomial symmetric functions rather than into Schur functions. The formula, which involves the transformed Macdonald polynomials \\\\widetilde{H}_\\\\mu rather than the usual P_\\\\lambda, is given as :\\\\widetilde{H}_\\\\mu(x;q,t) = \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma:\\\\mu \\\\to \\\\Z_+} q^{inv(\\\\sigma)}t^{maj(\\\\sigma)} x^{\\\\sigma} where œÉ is a filling of the Young diagram of shape Œº, inv and maj are certain combinatorial statistics (functions) defined on the filling œÉ. This formula expresses the Macdonald polynomials in infinitely many variables. To obtain the polynomials in n variables, simply restrict the formula to fillings that only use the integers 1, 2, ..., n. The term xœÉ should be interpreted as x_1^{\\\\sigma_1} x_2^{\\\\sigma_2} \\\\cdots where œÉi is the number of boxes in the filling of Œº with content i. This depicts the arm and the leg of a square of a Young diagram. The arm is the number of squares to its right, and the leg is the number of squares above it. The transformed Macdonald polynomials \\\\widetilde{H}_\\\\mu(x;q,t) in the formula above are related to the classical Macdonald polynomials P_{\\\\lambda} via a sequence of transformations. First, the integral form of the Macdonald polynomials, denoted J_\\\\lambda(x;q,t), is a re-scaling of P_\\\\lambda(x;q,t) that clears the denominators of the coefficients: :J_\\\\lambda(x;q,t)=\\\\prod_{s\\\\in D(\\\\lambda)}(1-q^{a(s)}t^{1+l(s)})\\\\cdot P_\\\\lambda(x;q,t) where D(\\\\lambda) is the collection of squares in the Young diagram of \\\\lambda, and a(s) and l(s) denote the arm and leg of the square s, as shown in the figure. Note: The figure at right uses French notation for tableau, which is flipped vertically from the English notation used on the wikipedia page for Young diagrams. French notation is more commonly used in the study of Macdonald polynomials. The transformed Macdonald polynomials \\\\widetilde{H}_\\\\mu(x;q,t) can then be defined in terms of the J_\\\\mu's. We have :\\\\widetilde{H}_\\\\mu(x;q,t)=t^{-n(\\\\mu)}J_\\\\mu\\\\left[\\\\frac{X}{1-t^{-1}};q,t^{-1}\\\\right] where :n(\\\\mu)=\\\\sum_{i}\\\\mu_i\\\\cdot (i-1). The bracket notation above denotes plethystic substitution. This formula can be used to prove Knop and Sahi's formula for the Jack polynomials. Non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials In 1995, Macdonald introduced a non-symmetric analogue of the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, and the symmetric Macdonald polynomials can easily be recovered from the non-symmetric counterpart. In his original definition, he shows that the non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials are a unique family of polynomials orthogonal to a certain inner product, as well as satisfying a triangularity property when expanded in the monomial basis. In 2007, Haglund, Haiman and Loehr gave a combinatorial formula for the non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. The non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials specialize to Demazure characters by taking q=t=0, and to key polynomials when q=t=‚àû. =Combinatorial formulae based on the exclusion process= In 2018, S. Corteel, O. Mandelshtam, and L. Williams used the exclusion process to give a direct combinatorial characterization of both symmetric and nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. Their results differ from the earlier work of Haglund in part because they give a formula directly for the Macdonald polynomials rather than a transformation thereof. They develop the concept of a multiline queue, which is a matrix containing balls or empty cells together with a mapping between balls and their neighbors and a combinatorial labeling mechanism. The nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomial then satisfies: :E_{\\\\lambda}(\\\\textbf{x};q,t)=\\\\sum_Q \\\\mathrm{wt}(Q) where the sum is over all L\\\\times n multiline queues of type \\\\lambda and \\\\mathrm{wt} is a weighting function mapping those queues to specific polynomials. The symmetric Macdonald polynomial satisfies: :P_{\\\\lambda}(\\\\textbf{x};q,t)=\\\\sum_{\\\\mu}E_{\\\\mu}(x_1,...,x_n;q,t)=\\\\sum_{\\\\mu}\\\\sum_Q \\\\mathrm{wt}(Q) where the outer sum is over all distinct compositions \\\\mu which are permutations of \\\\lambda, and the inner sum is as before.

Background Ofosu-Appiah was born in a village called Kukua near Adawso in the Eastern Region of Ghana. His parents were Seth Fianko ‚Äî a teacher and a descendant of the royal family of Kubease, Larteh, Ghana ‚Äî and Agnes Fianko (n√©e Reynolds) ‚Äî also a teacher and a descendant of the royal family of Akropong, Akwapim, Ghana. His education started at Adawso Presbyterian Primary School. In January 1932, he joined Achimota Secondary School for his secondary education. In 1939, he began his career as a Latin and Twi teacher at Achimota School. In January 1942, he joined the Junior Staff Department. He was appointed to work as an Assistant Librarian. He went on to work as an Assistant Museum Curator. In March 1944, the Achimota Council awarded him a scholarship to Oxford University, United Kingdom, and he was accepted at Hertford College. He was the first black African to come to Oxford to study Classics. He read Honour Moderations followed by Literae Humaniores. He went to Jesus College, Cambridge, United Kingdom, in October 1948 to complete a diploma in Anthropology. Shortly after that, he was appointed Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University College, Gold Coast, now University of Ghana. University College, Gold Coast, 1949‚Äì64 Ofosu-Appiah was the first African to be appointed to the Classics Department of the University College, Gold Coast, now University of Ghana. He taught the first year Intermediate Arts class Latin. In April 1951, he took his Master of Arts Degree and ceased to be a Junior Member of Oxford University from that date. In 1954, he had the honour of composing, in Latin, the inscription that was unveiled at the official opening of Akuafo Hall in 1955. In July 1954, he married Victoria Boohemaa Addo from Akropong, Akwapim. They had three daughters: Asantewa, Oseiwa and Asabea. In April 1959, he was promoted to a Senior Lectureship in Classics. He was then appointed Senior Tutor in Akuafo Hall and presented his first students for graduation to the Duke of Edinburgh at the Great Hall of the University. He was chosen to represent the University of Ghana at the inauguration of the University Institute in Mogadishu in January 1960. Ofosu-Appiah was elected a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Learning in 1961. He was subsequently elected to the Standing Committee of the Ghana Academy of Sciences for 1963-64. In October 1961, he was appointed as a government representative to the West African Examination Council. In 1962, he was appointed to the Interim Council of the University of Cape Coast to represent the Arts Faculty. Also in 1962, he was elected master of Akuafo Hall, University of Ghana, Legon. He was the first African master of the hall and the installation was done by Professor Adu Boahen, the Senior Tutor at the time. Ofosu-Appiah was also elected Chairman of the Board for University Primary School, Legon, in 1964. United States of America, 1964‚Äì66 Ofosu-Appiah was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship and the post of Visiting Professor of Classics at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States, for the academic year 1964-65. He was the first black person to join the faculty. He taught Latin and Greek and also helped the English Department by teaching English Literature. He was offered the distinguished scholar‚Äôs chair for 1965-66: \\"The Edgar B. Stern University Professor\\", at Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana. He accepted the post and was assigned to the Division of Humanities, where he taught Philosophy and Literature. Encyclopaedia Africana Secretariat Ofosu-Appiah accepted the position of Director of the Encyclopedia Africana Project in Accra in August 1966. This was a project inspired by W. E. B. Du Bois. He met with the then Director of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Sir William Hailley, who advised that the biographies would make sense only if they had a historical introduction and to have several volumes of country to country biographies. The first volume of the Encyclopaedia Africana Dictionary of Biographies, Ethiopia-Ghana, was published in June 1977. This was followed by the second volume, Sierra Leone-Zaire, in December 1979. Public service for the Republic of Ghana Ofosu-Appiah was appointed the Chairman of the Ghana Library Board in March 1967. In 1969, he opened the Bolgatanga Library. In 1970, when asked by the government of the Second Republic to continue as the Chairman, he created a new Ghana Library Board Act, which was implemented in June 1970. He was appointed a member of the National Advisory Committee of the National Liberation Council from 1967 to 1968. He was also appointed a member of the Committee on Imprisoned Political Offenders. In September 1967, he was appointed a member of the Board of Directors of the Ghana Airways Corporation until April 1969. After the inauguration of the Second Republic took place in 1969, he was offered the Chairmanship of the Ghana State Housing Corporation. He was also elected to the National Executive of the Progress Party in 1970 and subsequently appointed the Chairman of a Committee on the Winneba Training College. His terms of reference included suggestions for the improvement of higher education. Ofosu-Appiah chaired a committee set up in 1967 to establish lectures in memory of J.B. Danquah. The lectures began in February 1968. Ofosu-Appiah delivered the anniversary lectures in 1969, as well as the eighth series of lectures in 1975 on the subject: \\"Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford: The Man of Vision and Faith.\\" This lecture was published in 1976. In October 1968, he won a seat on the board of the Ghanaian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). He then went on to be elected the Honorary Secretary of the Ghana Academy of Sciences (GAS). Writing In 1962, Ofosu- Appiah translated Homer's Odyssey into Twi, and it was used as a set book by the Ministry of Education of Ghana. He wrote People in Bondage, which was published in the United States by Lerner Publishing Group, and Slavery: A Brief Survey, which was published in Ghana by Waterville. In 1969, he completed The Life and Times of J. B. Danquah, ensuring that the part Danquah played in Gold Coast politics would not be forgotten. This was eventually published in August 1974. 1970 saw the start of yet another book: The Life of Lt. General Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka. This book was published in 1972. At the suggestion of James Moxon, Ofosu-Appiah wrote the book The Life of Dr. J. E. K. Aggrey. This was published by Waterville just in time for the 100th Anniversary Celebration of the birth of Aggrey in 1975. Headstone of Lawrence Henry Yaw Ofosu-Appiah and Victoria Boohemaa Ofusu-Appiah In 1975, Ofosu- Appiah tried unsuccessfully to get a Twi Language and Literature Research Unit established. He did, however, succeed in acquiring funding for his Twi translation of Plato's Apology. He also translated Sophocles's Antigone for Waterville to publish. He was helped by Rev. E. K. Kwabbi, D. O. Kwapong, and E. T. Koramoa to achieve this goal. Death Again in 1975, Ofosu-Appiah began writing an English-Twi dictionary with the help of Mr E. O. Koranteng, who was, at the time, on the staff of the University of Ghana Language Centre. Ofosu-Appiah attempted to publish this dictionary in 1985 but could not find any publishers interested at the time. He also wrote an article for the Conspectus of the World Encyclopaedia of Black Peoples of the World that was published by Scholarly Press in September 1975. Ofosu-Appiah died on 1 June 1990, at the Luton & Dunstable Hospital, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom. He was buried at the Vale Cemetery, Butterfield Green, Luton, on 11 June 1990. His wife died on 12 May 2012 in Ghana and her ashes were brought to the Vale Cemetery for interment as she requested, being buried in his grave on 21 June 2012. He is survived by his two daughters Asantewa and Asabea. References *Yaw Twumasi, \\"Pioneering austerity in Ghana's Academia: L. H. Ofosu-Appiah\\", The Guardian, 20 June 1990.

He was a leader of the Algiers putsch of 1942.Jews in North Africa: Oppression and Resistance United States Holocaust Museum Memorial Background He spent his youth in Paris, and then entered the cours Simon, one of Paris' most prestigious theatrical institutions, to become an actor. As a soldier in the French Army, he was defeated at Marseilles in June 1940, where he took heed of General Charles de Gaulle's Appeal of 18 June. Entry into Resistance He went to North Africa in November 1941, with the hope of being able to get to Gibraltar from there so he could rejoin the allied forces. However, on the spot, he joined a group of patriot Gaullists created by his cousins Jos√© Aboulker and Roger Carcassonne, then extended to certain people by Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie. A member of this very clandestine network, Karsenty recruited resistance members, sought weapons and endeavoured to convince fellow Vichy soldiers to join a possible allied invasion. Cherchell He was one of the first organisers of the Cherchell meeting between resistance members and representatives of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, where he represented the resistance groups of Algiers. He stayed until the end, doing what was necessary, in spite of a wild sea, for putting afloat the kayak of General Clark, an associate of Eisenhower, allowing him to join his submarine before daybreak. Seizure of Algiers He participated in the Putsch of 8 November 1942, as the assistant of Jos√© Aboulker. In this operation, 400 resistant civilians arrested the Vichyist commander in chief General Juin, as well as Admiral Darlan, and succeeded in neutralising the 19th Vichy Army Corps for about 15 hours, which allowed the allied forces to carry out the Torch Operation, in which they unloaded unopposed, who then encircled Algiers and seized it the very same day. Assisting Jos√© Aboulker during the operation, he only arrested several of Darnand's soldiers, who had approached the central Police station too closely. He took part in two successive barrages on the Vichy defence circle of Algiers, to prevent the mobilization of the Vichyist forces from being carried out. The FFF Karsenty then rejoined the Free French Forces in England and was named staff officer in Carlton Gardens. In May 1943, he returned to Algiers and prepared for the arrival of General Charles de Gaulle, along with Roger Carcassonne and the opponents of the resistance group Combat. Promoted to officer of Cherchell school, then to second lieutenant, he was assigned to the first Free French Division and went up to Colmar where he arrived in December 1944. Here he learned of the execution of his brother Gaby, an engineer and resistance member in Marseilles, and also of the deportation of his father. He was then assigned to the Research Bureau of Lyon War Criminals. Since the war Karsenty has founded and directed several companies. His decorations were as follows: *La rosette de la M√©daille de la R√©sistance *Medal of Freedom of the United States. He represents the quite rare case of a holder of two quotations to his Military Cross, one given to him by General Charles de Gaulle and the other by Giraud.

Its responsibilities are to research, design, implement, operate, and evaluate new educational programs that could increase the education levels among the Mexican population, and could solve the cultural and educational problems of Mexican society. CONAFE's educational programs are designed to fit the needs, interests, practices, and overall context of students living in rural areas, in dispersed communities inhabited by migrant workers, peasant or indigenous populations. These are all marginalized communities living under the poverty line. Education in indigenous communities CONAFE's initiative is to work with small communities with no access to education and which are unable to meet a Ministry of Public Education (SEP) requirement regarding the minimum number of students to establish a federal or state school. The Ministry of Public Education requires a minimum of five students per academic level to justify the funding, construction, and operation of a school. Most indigenous communities have fewer than 100 inhabitants, and meeting SEP‚Äôs requirement has most of the time not been possible. For this reason, indigenous communities have been denied access to education. PAEPI: Proposal of Educational Attention for Indigenous Population CONAFE‚Äôs work experience with indigenous communities can be traced back to its foundation in 1971. CONAFE then served indigenous and mestizo communities from the highlands and rural areas of the state of Guerrero with the same educational program. The project of designing and operating a specific educational program for indigenous communities started until 1994, called Proposal of Educational Attention for Indigenous Population (PAEPI). Three principles guided the creation of PAEPI‚Äôs framework: #Each teacher has to speak the language spoken by the community where she/he is located, or at least she/he ought to speak a language from the same language family of the language spoken by the community. # Literacy teaching is to take place in the students‚Äô first language. # The culture of each community ought to be a guiding principle in the coursework. By 2005, positive empirical results of PAEPI were already visible in 22 of the 31 Mexican states. CONAFE granted PAEPI full status as a Program, changing its acronym to MAEPI, which stands for Modality of Educational Attention for Indigenous Population. MAEPI: Modality of Educational Attention for Indigenous Population MAEPI operates its primary education program in indigenous communities of less than 100 inhabitants and its preschool program with populations with less than 500 inhabitants. Indigenous teenagers and young adults are recruited by MAEPI to serve as Community Instructors in marginalized and isolated communities for a period of one or two years. During this period they are hosted and fed by the community where they are located. They also receive a monthly stipend to help them meet their basic needs. Once they finish their one year service as Community Instructors, they receive a monthly scholarship over a period of 30 months. Those who completed a 2-years service get the scholarship during a period of 60 months. Community Instructors are between 14 and 25 years old. They must have completed their secondary school degree in order to be eligible for a Community Instructor position. CONAFE targets specifically this group age since our main goal is to encourage students to continue their studies by making it a real and affordable possibility. Today, 3,722 communities and 30,000 students are benefited by MAEPI. There are three major action areas involved in MAEPI: #the training of Community Instructors #the design and operation of basic education programs #the production of didactic materials. The general characteristics of these areas are explained below. =Training of Community Instructors= There are two different training processes that help instructors to develop abilities for their performance as teachers in the indigenous communities. The first one is the Initial Training. It is offered before the start of the school year, during a period of intensive daily training sessions that last over one month. The second one is the Permanent Training that takes place in monthly meetings where Community Instructors get together with other key actors involved in the educational program, such as Tutors, Educational Assistants, Academic or Regional Coordinators and other staff members. These meetings are held for people to exchange thoughts and feelings about their experience in the communities, the problems and obstacles they have faced, the strategies they have implemented to solve them, and the needs they have found and demand attention. Each actor has specific objectives to meet at these meetings according to their responsibilities. The training covers three fields: Education, Linguistic Research and Workshop, and Technology. Instructors are trained to understand and apply the educational principles and methodology of MAEPI. They are also introduced to linguistic analysis and exercises that can help them create a practical alphabet of their own language. Instructors are also taught how to use technological devises such as computers, scanners, printers, digital cameras and sound recorders, software (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Inspiration), and the Internet. =Design of Basic Education Programs= The main goal of CONAFE‚Äôs educational programs for indigenous people is to turn the school into a space owned by the community where people can recreate and develop their language and culture; where a meaningful and useful exchange of knowledge, beliefs, traditions can take place with people coming from closer or faraway places and with similar or different cultures; where modern technologies can be used to improve the people‚Äôs life quality. Community Instructors are trained to follow a practical educational methodology in the classrooms. This methodology consists of three different stages: *Problematization. Students learn to identify relevant topics, they learn to problematize what they already know and think about issues related to the main theme. They identify what they do not know about it, and what sources they can consult to look for further information. Students learn to create an agenda and to plan the activities for their research project. When students have access to communication and computer technology, they can use several software to elaborate their work plan or conceptual maps. The Internet can be used as a source of information. *Research. Students develop skills to study on their own, and to identify, to choose, and to make use of different useful sources of information. Sources can be books and other written material, as well as people‚Äôs oral testimonies, stories, and opinions about a specific issue. Computer technology can be used to document the activities in the research processes, and to store images and sound recordings. *Organization and socialization of the learning process. Due to the multilevel character of MAEPI courses, one of the guiding principles of the course is that students learn to play the role of experts, teachers, and coordinators when circumstances demand it. =Participation in the  Adults and children may learn together in the same classroom, as well as students with different ages and at different school levels; students who only speak an indigenous language work together with bilingual students who speak Spanish and an indigenous language. On one hand, students learn to listen and respect the person in charge of an activity, an exposition, a class presentation, or a project. This person will not always be the Community Instructor, since every person in the community or in the classroom can have that role. On the other hand, students also learn to communicate what they know and what they have learned, they learn to lead a class presentation or discussion, to present a community campaign, to spread information. Instructors can use several software to make follow-ups of the group‚Äôs and students‚Äô participation. They can use email to communicate and coordinate tasks and activities with other instructors, coordinators, and other actors involved in MAEPI. Instructors and students may also create websites to publish their work, and to discover the work of other students in the different regions where MAEPI reaches out. Students design and produce posters, cards, flyers, for events, meetings and other activities in their communities. =Production of Didactic Material= There is a wide diversity of indigenous languages and variant dialects in Mexico and in the communities where MAEPI operates. Given that the production and publishing of books in some of the most widely spoken indigenous languages would miss the educational purposes of MAEPI, namely to offer quality education in the first language of every group of students, MAEPI has encouraged Community Instructors and students to create their own didactic materials using their own language, their imagination and creative skills. =Bilingual materials= To pursue this goal, MAEPI has strived to: #Raise awareness among students and Community Instructors about the richness and potentialities of their language. #Have Community Instructors develop basic writing and reading skills in the indigenous language that they speak. #Design tools to systematize the community‚Äôs knowledge to draw from this information the topics and contents of the didactic material (filing cards, journals, etc.) Each MAEPI school has made bilingual, handwritten material in Spanish and in indigenous languages. This material keeps growing year by year. In addition, MAEPI schools are provided with the Spanish written books that the Ministry of Public Education (SEP) distributes at the national level. In this way, MAEPI instructors and students not only learn to read and write, they learn how to create their own means of communication and expression, they develop skills to think and to imagine them, to define their purpose, to choose meaningful educational contents, to present the information in the most appropriate way, and to create a format that fits the purposes. Community Instructors and students learn how to use different sources of information, and at the same time, they become informants of their own culture, language and knowledge. =CECMI: The Community Education Center = Since 1994, MAEPI designed and operated preschool and primary educational programs. Creating a secondary program for young students, as well as primary and secondary program for adults soon became a visible need of the communities where MAEPI operated. These programs began to be designed and piloted in 2002, along with a program of Initial Education directed to pregnant women and mothers of under 3-years old children. The Community Education Center emerged as a strategy to simultaneously offer all education programs (preschool, primary and secondary school for young and adult population, and initial education) in MAEPI schools with at least 8 students. Only Community Instructors with 1 year experience with MAEPI are trained to manage a multilevel class of this kind. A class of each Community Instructor should not exceed the limit of 15 students. According to the Educational Proposal, each CECMI needs to have a library, computer lab, materials for workshops, artistic and cultural activities, and the development of bilingualism. The CECMI project intends *to increase community members participation in the educational programs. *to enable students, specially women, who graduated from MAEPI primary courses to continue with their secondary schooling. *to close the educational gap between the mestizo and the indigenous population . *to promote the introduction of communication and information technology in the Indigenous Education. *to encourage communities¬¥ active involvement in the development of sustainable education projects in the indigenous contexts. Today there are 136 working Community Education Centers in Mexico. CONAFE‚Äôs goals are to turn every MAEPI school into a CECMI and to have a Community Computer Lab (CCD) in each of them. CONAFE and the National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous People (CDI) have signed the agreement to pour US$3,400,000 into the construction of classrooms and the acquisition of computer equipment during the term 2006-2007. With these resources CECMIs and CCDs will be built in Mexico‚Äôs fifty municipalities with the lowest well-being standards. It is expected that through this kind of agreements, all communities assisted by MAEPI will have the chance to have a classroom of their own and a computer lab to make use of for the development of their own community.

Research suggests that the first settlers (probably hunters) came from the Padana Plain and the Venetian Prealps, after the first glaciers began melting at the end of the Pleistocene glaciations. Findings (in particular, burials) from the Mesolithic period have been found in several parts of the province. These include the comuni of Zambana and Mezzocorona. A large area of a hunting-based settlement from the Neolithic period has been found near the lakes of Colbric√≤n, not far from the Rolle Pass. Around 500 BC, the Raetians appeared in the Trentine area, coming from the Central and Eastern Alps area. They settled in several valleys and brought new skills on top of the traditional hunting: agriculture (grapes, vegetables, cereals), breeding (ovines, goats, bovines and horses). During the Roman Age, part of the current Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol region made up the province of Raetia. This region was totally conquered by the Romans in the 1st century BC. The definitive defeat of the Rhaetians, near Bolzano, occurred during the military campaigns in the Alps of Drusus and Tiberius (16-17 BC). Trento became a Roman municipium in the 40s BC. During the reign of Emperor Claudius (41-54 AD) Trentino was integrated into the Imperial road network with the construction of the Via Claudia Augusta Padana (from Ostiglia to the Resia Pass) and the Via Augusta Altinate (from Treviso to Trento, passing through the Valsugana). Claudius also issued an Edict, contained in the Tabula clesiana, which extended Roman citizenship to the residents of this region. By the fourth century the area was fully latinisated.  Bishopric of Trent  The Prince- Bishops of Trent ruled the region from Buonconsiglio Castle since the 13th century During the Late Antiquity, in the 5th century AD, Trentino was invaded several times, from North and East: first by the Ostrogoths, then by the Bavarians and Byzantines and finally by the Lombards. With the latter's domination, an idea of the territorial identity of the province began to take shape (Tridentinum territorium). In the same century, the region became largely Christianized. In 774 Trentino was conquered by the Franks and became part of the Kingdom of Italy, a sometimes vague entity included in what was to become the Holy Roman Empire. The first territorial unity of Trentino dates back to 1027, when emperor Conrad II officially gave the rule of the area to the Bishopric of Trent. This entity survived for some eight centuries and granted Trentino a certain autonomy, first from the Holy Roman Empire and then from the Austrian Empire.  Part of Austria  In the early 19th century some of the Trentine people participated actively in the resistance, led by the Tyrolean Andreas Hofer, against the French invasion. Trentino (green area) was part of the \\"Alto Adige Department\\" under Napoleon Napoleon created in 1810 the Department of Alto Adige that included most of actual Trentino and the area around Bolzano in Alto AdigeResearch on Italian Alto Adige (and Trentino). It was part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy for some years. After the end of the Napoleonic era (1815), the Bishopric of Trent was dissolved and Trentino became part of the County of Tyrol, in which the majority of the population was German speaking. Though relatively well administered, and despite the presence of Trentine representatives in the Diets of Innsbruck and Vienna, in the second half of the 19th century a movement (part of the general movement called Italian irredentism) arose with the aim of annexing all the region (south of the Alps watershed) to the Kingdom of Italy: this, however, was largely put forward by intellectuals like Cesare Battisti and Fabio Filzi, and met some support by the predominantly rural population. Given the area's strategic importance in the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Italy, the Austro-Hungarians strengthened their troop levels there and fortified the area in the early twentieth century. Under the authority of the Austro- Hungarian chief of staff Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf, modern, armored fortifications were built in the areas around Lavarone and Folgaria; their dual purpose was to protect against an Italian attack and to secure the area as a staging ground for an Austrian assault on Northern Italy.Rothenburg, G. The Army of Francis Joseph. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 163. After Italy entered the First World War in 1915, the Trentine territory was an important front between Italy and Austria-Hungary, and suffered heavy destruction. After the call to arms summoned by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria on July 31, 1914, more than 55,000 Trentini fought for Austria, first against Russia and Serbia and, starting from 1915, also against Italians. Despite the fact that they were fighting against Italian soldiers (Trentini soldiers spoke Italian) desertion cases were extremely low.. More than 10,000 of them died, and many others were wounded or made prisoners. Further, hundreds of thousands of civilians were forced to abandon their native area when they were too near to the front lines. Many of them, captured by the Italian Army, were later transferred to Southern Italy as colonists. Union to Italy  With the Treaty of Saint-Germain (1919), Trentino was united to Italy, together with the new Province of Bolzano/Bozen (South Tyrol), as part of Venezia Tridentina. The centralization process brought on by the Fascists reduced the autonomy that cities like Trento or Rovereto had enjoyed under the preceding Liberal governments, while many of the smaller comuni were united, reducing their number from the 366 under the Habsburg to 127.  Autonomy  Detailed map of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino, formed by the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. After World War II, the treaty signed by the Italian and Austrian Ministers of Foreign affairs, Alcide De Gasperi and Karl Gruber, the autonomous Region of Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol was created (see Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement). In the following decades the main party in Trentino was the Christian Democracy, while autonomistic instances found their voice in the Partito Popolare Trentino Tirolese (Trentine-Tyrolese Popular Party). In 1957 strife between Trentino and the largely German-speaking South Tyrol led to the popularity of the slogan Los von Trient (\\"Away from Trento\\"). In 1972 the regional administration was handed over to the two provinces. In the 1960s and 1970s Trentino witnessed strong economic development, spurred mainly by the tourism sector and by the new autonomy. It is currently one of the richest and best developed Italian provinces. In 1996, the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol- Trentino was formed between the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. The boundaries of the association correspond to the old County of Tyrol. The aim is to promote regional peace, understanding and cooperation in many areas. The region's assemblies meet together as one on various occasions and have set up a common liaison office to the European Union in Brussels.

The historic village centre is surrounded by extended fields, meadows and pine forests. History Parish church A fortress overlooking the Finow valley and a ford across the river was erected about 1220, after the area settled by Polabian Slavs had been conquered by the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. The foundations of the parish church date back to around 1250. The settlement itself was first mentioned in a 1334 deed issued by the Wittelsbach margrave Louis I. Temporarily held by Count Henry Matthias of Thurn, the estates were sold to the Pfuel noble family in 1614. During the indecisive stance of Brandenburg in the Thirty Years' War, Hohenfinow was devastated by a contingent under Ernst von Mansfeld in 1626, and again by Imperial, Saxon and Swedish troops in the following years. The rebuilding began with three remaining farmsteads. In 1780 the cornfields of Hohenfinow were mentioned in a travel account by Johann III Bernoulli. In 1855 the Hohenfinow manor was purchased by Felix von Bethmann-Hollweg (1824‚Äì1900), scion of a Frankfurt banking dynasty and father of the later German chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, who was born here in 1856. In the last days of World War II, a unit of the \\"Army Detachment Steiner\\" rested near Hohenfinow before the troops withdraw to Eberswalde.

It is located on the Mudanjiang River (formerly known as Hurka River), which flows north, eventually falling into the Sungari River near Sanxing. Administratively, Ning'an is now a county-level city, and a constituent part of the prefecture-level city of Mudanjiang. The land area of the entire county-level city of Ning'an is ; the reported population count, as of 2004, stood at 440,000. The government of the \\"county-level city\\" is located in the town of the same name ().Mudanjiang City info Notable geographic features of the county-level city of Ning'an include Lake Jingpo and a crater underground forest (). Lake Jingpo is a natural reservoir on the Mudanjiang River upstream (about southwest, straight-line distance) from Ning'an central urban area, result of the volcanic eruptions about 10,000 years ago. History Sanggyeong (, Shangjing), one of the capitals of the Balhae kingdom (between 756 and 785, and between 793 and 926), was located within today's county-level city of Ning'an.Shangjing Longquanfu, the Capital of the Bohai (Parhae) State Its site was near today's small towns of Dongjingcheng () and Bohai (; ), about upstream (southwest) from the Ning'an main urban area. Northeastern part of the map of China and Chinese Tartary (1735; based on the expedition of 1709), with Ninguta shown within Jilin Province During the early Qing dynasty, the town of Ning'an, known then under the Manchu name '('NinggutaManchu Veritable Record Vol.3) (transcribed into Chinese as ÂÆÅÂè§Â°î, Ningguta), was one of the most important towns in the entire Manchuria beyond the \\"Willow Palisade\\". The name \\"Ningguta\\" literally means \\"six\\" in Manchu language because it was once guarded by six grandsons of M√∂ngke Tem√ºr (). The Hurka River valley, where Ninguta was located, was the traditional homeland of the Jianzhou Jurchens (who later started calling themselves Manchus), Ninguta and Sanxing being the two oldest centers of the incipient Manchu state. After the Manchus conquered all of China in 1644, the Ninguta area continued to be considered by the Qing dynasty ruling family as the place of its origin. Already in 1652 the Qing government sent 2000 horsemen, armed with bows, matchlock firearms, and iron cannons, commanded by Sarhuda to set a garrison at Ninguta, which was the first Qing garrison beyond the Willow Palisade.. When quoting Du Halde, Reardon-Anderson implies that the Jesuit went to the region personally in the 1730s. That wasn't actually the case, as du Halde was merely the editor of a report by the Jesuits who had travelled down the Amur in 1709, one of many reports from which his multi-volume work was compiled. In June 1653 Sarhuda's position became styled \\"military deputy-lieutenant governor\\" (, or amban-jianggin in Manchu) . There is also same article converted to HTML by Google and a deputy lieutenant general () were appointed to command the Ninguta garrison. The suitability of Ninguta as an administrative center was in part due to its location on the Hurka River (or, for the original site, on the Hurka's tributary Hailang), which provided a convenient transportation route connecting Ninguta with the lower Sungari and the lower Amur River. Early on, a great dockyard operated in Ninguta, building boats for the Mudanjiang/Sungari/Amur river system, although it was later relocated to Jilin City.Lattimore (1931), p. 108 In 1658 Sarhuda, in charge of a Manchu fleet of several dozen ships, and including also General Shin Ryu's Korean force, sailed from Ninguta down the Hurka and the Sungari, to defeat the smaller fleet of the Russian Cossack Onufriy Stepanov near the fall of the Sungari into the Amur. After the death of Sarhuda in 1659, his son Bahai () was appointed to occupy Sarhuda's position. In 1662, the title of the military deputy-lieutenant governor (amban-jianggin) position was changed to the Ninguta Military Governor (), Bahai being the first occupant of this post, while the office of the deputy lieutenant general was relocated to Jilin City. The early location of the Ninguta fortress was not at today's Ning'an, but some to the northwest, on the Hailang River (a tributary of Mudanjiang River). That site is located near the present-day Gucheng village (), part of small town of Changting (; ). That site is not within the modern County-level city of Ning'an, but in the neighboring County-level city of Hailin. In 1891, just a few years before the beginning of the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the rise of Mudanjiang, Ninguta still remained one of the most important cities of Manchuria. In Jilin Province as it existed at the time, it was second only to Jilin City Growth of the more conveniently located Jilin City resulted in the decrease of the relative importance of Ninguta. Still, Ninguta was the main seat of government of the eastern half of the beyond-the- palisade Manchuria until 1676, when the Military Governor (jiangjun) moved from Ninguta to Jilin City (then called Jilin Ula Cheng, i.e. Jilin River City), and the Deputy Lieutenant-General () was transferred in the opposite direction (from Jilin City to Ninguta). Although now lower-ranked than Jilin City, Ninguta retained its importance into the 18th and 19th century as one of the few cities existing beyond the Willow Palisade. The Deputy Lieutenant- General stationed there was the top government official for the entire region stretching east to the Sea of Japan and populated primarily by a variety of Tungusic peoples, such as the Nanais.The Historical Atlas of China (ed. Tan), the Qing dynasty map showing the administrative boundaries as of 1820 According to the evidence of the Jesuits who visited the area in 1709 along with a government-sponsored ginseng-harvesting expedition,du Halde (1735), p. 8 by the early 18th century Ninguta had become an important center of trade in the local forest products, namely ginseng harvested in the region, and the sable pelts, collected as tax from the Nanai natives. Therefore, besides the Manchu garrison and the officials, Ninguta was home to numerous Chinese civilians, some of whom had come to Ninguta from faraway provinces in order to participate in the profitable commerce. There were already numerous peasant villages around the town, some at quite a distance from it, populated both by Manchus and by Han Chinese exiled to this area for various offenses against the law. (Convicts started being sent to Ninguta area as early as 1660; anti- Qing rebels, captured in southern China, followed in 1661Reardon-Anderson (2005), p. 26) A variety of cereal crops, such as millet and oats were grown there.

It was founded in 1996 by the City of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and The Pew Charitable Trusts. In 1998, House Bill 2858, Act 174 designated VISIT PHILADELPHIA, then GPTMC, to serve as the official Regional Attractions Marketing Agency.  Corporate Information  Philadelphia's City Hall As the region‚Äôs official tourism marketing agency, Visit Philadelphia works to build the Greater Philadelphia area‚Äôs image, drive visitation and boost the economy. The organization utilizes robust campaigns, media relations, advertising, websites and social media to market the area and promote tourism. It‚Äôs goal is to show potential tourists that Philadelphia is a destination to visit. History= Founding = Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell created the GPTMC in 1996 to attract tourists; the corporation operated separately from the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau.Tourism, in Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia (Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities, Rutgers-Camden). According to the Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia, the newly created agency \\"took a regional approach to 'Philadelphia and Its Countryside' and formed partnerships with similar organizations in the region: the Valley Forge Convention and Visitors Board, Visit Bucks County, and the Brandywine Conference and Visitors Bureau, among others.\\" = Name Change = Prior to 2013, Visit Philadelphia was named The Greater Philadelphia Tourism and Marketing Corporation (GPTMC). The name change was an effort to utilize a more self-explanatory moniker. In 2010, Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corp. launched a new web platform, VisitPhilly.com.  Notable Initiatives and Programs = Philly, the City that Loves You Back = Its first national ad campaign took place in 1997.Fact Sheet: VISIT PHILADELPHIA's 20-Year Timeline (1996-2016): Twenty Years of Greater Philadelphia's Tourism Marketing Corporation, Visit Philadelphia September 12, 2016. This campaign introduced the slogan \\"The City that Loves you Back\\" as both \\"a reply and a challenge to the 'I Love New York' slogan\\" and a way to counter the \\"antisocial reputation\\" that Philadelphia had developed.Richardson Dilworth, \\"The City that Loves you Back\\" in Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia (Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities, Rutgers-Camden). In 2009, Visit Philadelphia began a new campaign with the \\"With Love, Philadelphia XOXO\\" tagline.  Controversies and Disputes = Embezzlement Scandal = Joyce Levitt, who worked for Visit Philadelphia from 2003 to 2012 and served as CFO for seven years, embezzled $210,000 from the organization between September 2005 and the discovery of the fraud in 2012.Chris Palmer, Visit Philadelphia ex-CFO pleads guilty to theft, fraud, Philadelphia Inquirer (May 12, 2016).Chris Hepp, Misuse of $210K handled quietly by city's marketers, Philadelphia Inquirer (June 6, 2014). Visit Philadelphia did not report the misconduct to authorities, instead allowing Levitt to quietly resign and pay full restitution. In 2014, following media reports, the Philadelphia District Attorney conducted a grand jury investigation leading to the prosecution of Levitt. In May 2016, in a plea agreement with prosecutors, Levitt pleaded guilty to theft, receiving stolen property, and fraud, and was sentenced to three years' probation and community service; she also forfeited her accounting license. = Consolidation Attempt = In 2014, the Philadelphia City Controller's office issued a report urging the consolidation of Visit Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau. The report found that the agencies had occasionally clashed, had competing slogans, and did not adequately coordinate efforts, and concluded that merging the two agencies could save $1 million in administrative costs annually.Chris Hepp, City controller: combine Philadelphia's two marketing arms, Philadelphia Inquirer (September 10, 2014). The report found that from 1993 to 2013, \\"the annual number of overnight leisure travelers to Philadelphia increased by 84 percent\\" and Visit Philadelphia was credited for about two-thirds of that increase. The report contrasted this to business travel (the responsibility of PHLCVB), which was \\"essentially flat since 1997.\\" The report, found, however, that PHLCVB had a better return on investment (\\"$74 for each tax dollar spent as opposed to $69 per tax dollar spent by Visit Philadelphia\\") because business travelers tend to spend more than tourists.
