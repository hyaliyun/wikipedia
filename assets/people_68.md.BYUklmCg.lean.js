Instead of obtaining a Presidential permit, sponsors of oil pipelines and electric transmission projects that cross international borders would be required to obtain a certificate of crossing from either the United States Secretary of State or the United States Secretary of Energy. The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The North American Energy Infrastructure Act would prohibit any person from constructing, connecting, operating, or maintaining an oil or natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility at the national boundary of the United States for the import or export of oil, natural gas, or electricity to or from Canada or Mexico without obtaining approval under this Act. The bill would require the United States Secretary of Commerce, with respect to oil pipelines, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), with respect to natural gas pipelines, or the United States Secretary of Energy (DOE), with respect to electric transmission facilities, to approve a request for approval of construction, connection, operation, or maintenance unless it is not in U.S. national security interests. The bill would declare that such an approval shall not be construed to constitute a major federal action for purposes of environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The bill would make conforming amendments to the Natural Gas Act and the Federal Power Act. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on May 8, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3301 would make changes to permitting requirements for pipelines and other energy infrastructure at international borders. In particular, the bill would eliminate the existing requirement on sponsors of such infrastructure to obtain a Presidential permit. Instead, H.R. 3301 would require sponsors of oil pipelines and electric transmission projects that cross international borders to obtain a certificate of crossing from either the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Energy. Under H.R. 3301, sponsors of natural gas pipelines would not be required to obtain a certificate of crossing. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 3301 would have no significant net effect on the federal budget. Relative to current law, we expect that any changes to administrative costs incurred by agencies responsible for regulating energy infrastructure would not exceed $500,000 in any year, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting H.R. 3301 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3301 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The North American Energy Infrastructure Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on October 22, 2013 by Rep. Fred Upton (R, MI-6). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power, the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. On June 19, 2014, the bill was reported (amended) by the Committee on Energy and Commerce alongside House Report 113-482 part 1. On June 24, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 354 to pass the bill 238-173. Debate and discussion One of the effect of the legislation, if it were to pass, is that it would no longer be the President of the United States' responsibility to approve cross-border pipelines similar to the Keystone Pipeline, but the approval process for the Keystone Pipeline would not be changed. President Barack Obama released a statement saying that the bill \\"would impose an unreasonable deadline that would curtail the thorough consideration of the issues involved, which could result in serious security, safety, foreign policy, environmental, economic, and other ramifications.\\" Obama threatened to veto the bill. The bill's supporters indicated that they were very frustrated with the lengthy, over five years long process that the Obama administration was using to consider the Keystone Pipeline. Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI) said that the bill \\"is a sincere effort to focus a targeted solution to lessons learned from the Keystone pipeline... No one can rightly argue that the current presidential permit process as the State Department is not broken, no matter what side of the climate debate you're on.\\" Upton also argued that \\"we're creating a fair and transparent approval process for cross-border energy projects, putting them all on a level playing field for the benefit of North American energy security, lower energy prices, and jobs.\\" The United States Chamber of Commerce released a statement that they \\"strongly support\\" the bill because it would \\"be an important step in reforming this country's broken federal regulatory process, in order to create jobs and strengthen the economy.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3301 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3301 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3301 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3301 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3301 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3301 *House Report 113-482 part 1 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"North American Energy Infrastructure Act"},{"id":"43134408","text":"John Tahourdin White (1809‚Äì1893) was an English classical scholar.

Following years of IGAD's involvement in stabilization efforts in Somalia, Maalim also led the establishment of a Special Envoy's office to Somalia in 2017. IGAD has gone through a noticeable institutional expansion during Maalim's tenure with the establishment of numerous IGAD specialized institutions including: * IGAD Security Sector Program (ISSP), set up on 6 October 2011 to support IGAD Member State security institutions to combat terrorism, transnational organized crime and regional maritime security concerns; * IGAD Center for Pastoral Areas and Livestock Development (ICPALD), set up in 2015 as a dedicated center for regional livestock and pastoral development; * IGAD Centre of Excellence for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism (ICEPCVE), set up in 2018 to combat concerns related to rising violent extremism in the region; and * IGAD Sheikh Technical Veterinary School (ISTVS), adopted as an IGAD Specialized agency in 2011.

See also a page for his father: Zalman Goldberg, filled in by Barbara Kupsick Klion (his granddaughter), 19 February 1997, in The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names, Yad Vashem website. He received a traditional Jewish education and studied in a yeshiva in his hometown, but as he showed artistic talents, he left it and went to Germany to study art in workshops and art schools. In 1912 he returned to Poland, to the city of Warsaw, and opened a photographic studio. Before long he was hired by the publishing house \\"Yehudiya\\", owned by the Yiddish daily Haynt, as a graphic designer in order to produce greeting cards and postcards. Goldberg created colored cards, using a composite method, creating his own style in this niche of Jewish art. First he photographed in his studio staged scenes portrayed by amateur actors, along with appropriate clothing and setting, and then he used painting and graphics techniques to add the pictures illustrated elements and short Yiddish rhymed greetings he composed. Thus he created series of popular postcards in various themes ‚Äì Shana Tova ('Happy New Year') greeting cards, postcards depicting Jewish occupations, etc. Shalom Sabar, scholar of Jewish art and folklore, defines Goldberg as \\"perhaps the most important of Shana Tova greeting cards designers operat[ing] in Poland at the beginning of the 20th century... While he was not an artist of the first rank, his diverse talents as photographer, amateur painter, graphic designer and even an occasional poet have found a suitable platform in the form of greeting cards designing. Before printing the final version, Goldberg added to the photograph of the staged scene produced in his studio the last details: drawing necessary elements, retouching, the words 'Shana Tova' ('for a good year') and finally a decorative plate embedded with light rhymes 'explaining' the image.\\"Shalom Sabar, ‚Äúme ºa shno·π≠ kar·π≠ise \\"shana ·π≠ova\\": le-toldotav shel ha-minhag ve-hitpathuto ht-omanutit,‚Äù in: Muky Tsur (ed.), Ba-shanah ha-ba ºah :'shanot ·π≠ovot' min ha-·∏≥ibuts, Giv ªat ·∏§avivah: Yad Ya ªari, ha-Merkaz le-ti ªud ·πøe-·∏•e·∏≥er shel ha-Shomer ha-tsa ªir; ·∏≤iryat ≈öedeh Bo·∏≥er: Ha-Merkaz le-moreshet Ben-Guryon, Universi·π≠at Ben-Guryon ba-Negev; Ef ªal: Yad ·π¨aben·∏≥in, merkaz me·∏•·∏≥ari ra ªyoni ·πøe-ti ªudi shel ha-tenu ªah ha- ·∏≥ibutsit, 2001, p. 21 (Hebrew). He adds that \\"despite the staging and the artificiality of these scenes, they contain valuable ethnographic data regarding customs and how they were performed, garments, Jewish occupations, the appearance of religious articles and home interior like furniture and ornaments.\\" In those years he also issued humorous collections and leaflets for Jewish holidays (yontev bleter), in the artistic name \\"Haggai\\". Beginning in the end of the 1910s, he illustrated a series of Yiddish and Hebrew children's books published in Warsaw, including the Hebrew illustrated children's library Shibolim ('ears') ‚Äì a series of 70 illustrated, dotted booklets, most of which were adapted folktale (E. Gitlin, beginning of the 1920s); Agadot Yavan ('Legends of Greece', i.e., Greek mythology; 3 vols., E. Gitlin, 1922) ‚Äì in Hebrew, adapted by Eliezer Mitropolitnsky, and a simultaneous Yiddish edition translated by H.Z.: grikhishe mitn; the \\"Tarbut\\"'s Hebrew toddler's library Tsil Tslil, which he also designed and printed; and the Hebrew reader Tsafririm by Itzhak Katzenelson and Itzhak Berkman (Ahisefer, mid-1920s). He also painted many title pages, like the title page of Yosef Ravin's children's series Maysehlekh fun der gantser velt ('tales from around the world'; E. Gitlin, mid-1920s) and that of the 2nd Haynt's jubilee book (1938).Finkelstein, Hayn·π≠, Tel-Aviv 1978, p. 288 (Yiddish). In the 1920s Goldberg opened in Kr√≥lewska street in Warsaw a printing house and artistic zincography studio named \\"Grafikon\\". In the workshop, where he worked alongside his wife Esther,Esther Goldberg: Page of Testimony filled in by Naftali Schneid, 14 July 1956, in The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names, Yad Vashem website. he designed Hebrew fonts, printing ornaments and lithography and made matrices for a number of publishing houses and newspapers.Nachman Mayzel, ‚ÄúDi yidish-poylishe ·∏≥instler- plasti·∏≥er,‚Äù Ge·πøen amol a lebn: dos Yidishe ·∏≥ul·π≠ur-lebn in Poyln, Buenos Aires: Tsen·π≠ral-farband fun Poylishe Yidn in Argen·π≠ine, 1951, p. 186 (Yiddish). Apart from his fondness for rhyming and painting title pages, Goldberg had a special affection for making letters. He aspired to improve the Hebrew typography (especially in the context of the Jewish print in Poland), because he thought it flawed and believed it impaired the enjoyment of reading, and sought to come up with a new script that would fit the living word. In 1922 he published an article in Kultur Lige's bibliographic journal Bikher-velt ('Book World') on the need for reform and modernization of the Hebrew font. He spent considerable effort making sketches for letters. His drafts, which he published in Hebrew and Yiddish periodicals, demonstrated great imagination.J√≥zef Sandel, ‚ÄúHaim Goldberg,‚Äù Umgekumene Yidishe kins·π≠ler in Poyln, vol. 1, Warsaw: Farlag Yidish Bukh, 1957, pp. 83-84 (Yiddish). In the 1930s he published poems and stories in Hebrew and Yiddish in children's periodicals such as Olami hakatan ('My Little World'). His poems and stories were also published in books, some of which he himself illustrated and printed with his typographic innovations. Goldberg was a founding member of and active in the Association of Visual Artists of the Jews in Poland. Goldberg aspired to publish Yiddish books in a European style, in a small edition, accompanied by original artwork by renowned Jewish artists. In 1931 he himself published a monograph on the artist Moshe Appelbaum, accompanied by high-quality reproductions. In 1935 the Paris publishing house \\"Le Triangle\\", which specialized in Jewish art, published an album consisting of 50 of his paintings on Jewish themes, with an introduction by the French art critic Paul Fierens. The reviews praised the graphical quality of it, and despite the specific theme, Goldberg's paintings were modernist, as well as romantic- realistic. During the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Goldberg managed to escape to the city of Bia≈Çystok, which was occupied by the Soviet Union. He lived there during the Soviet occupation and worked in zincography. After the occupation of Bialystok by the Germans in 1941 he was interned in the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto. There he was in charge of the drawing of the Judenrat's formal posters, which were made in an elegant paintings and hanged on the Council's Building.Nachman Blumenthal, ‚Äúmavo,‚Äù in: Blumenthal, Darko shel Yudenra·π≠: te ªudot mi-ge·π≠o Byalis·π≠o·∏≥, Yerushalayim: Yad ·πøa-shem, 1962 (Hebrew). Haim Goldberg perished in 1943 in the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto (according to another source, in Treblinka). His wife Esther (b. 1900) also perished in the Holocaust, as well as their only son, Max (b. 1919), who had followed in his parents' footsteps and studied graphics and artistic photography at the Vienna H√∂here Graphische Bundes-Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt (according to a rumor, he died as a partisan).Max Goldberg: Page of Testimony filled in by Naftali Schneid, 14 July 1956, in The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names, Yad Vashem website. An album was found among the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, containing 32 of Goldberg's postcards printed by \\"Yehudiya\\" in Warsaw in 1912-1918. The pictures are kept in the collection of the National Library of Poland.

It comprised Army, Air Force, and Navy components. It included Army Project Nike missiles (Ajax and Hercules) anti-aircraft defenses and USAF interceptors (manned aircraft and BOMARC missiles). The primary purpose of continental air defense during the CONAD period was to provide sufficient attack warning of a Soviet bomber air raid to ensure Strategic Air Command could launch a counterattack without being destroyed. CONAD controlled nuclear air defense weapons such as the 10 kiloton W-40 nuclear warhead on the CIM-10B BOMARC. The command was disestablished in 1975, and Aerospace Defense Command became the major U.S. component of North American Air Defense Command (NORAD). Background As the new U.S. Air Force was being established in 1947, consideration of a joint command for air defense began. After the USAF initiated the development of the \\"1954 interceptor\\" (WS-201) to counter expected Soviet bomber advances, the Army deployed M-33 Fire Control for AA artillery in 1950. A proposal for a joint/unified command for air defense was initiated (and failed) in 1950. The new Air Defense Command (ADC) at Ent AFB, and Army Antiaircraft Command (ARAACOM) staffed in the nearby Antlers Hotel (Colorado) was established in 1951. The same year, the Priority Permanent System began replacing the post- war Lashup Radar Network. A direct telephone line was installed in mid-July 1950 between CONAC headquarters and the 26th Air Division HQ at Roslyn Air Warning Station. This marked \\"the beginning of the Air Force air raid warning system\\". When the Korean War broke out, the USAF established a direct telephone line between the Air Force Command Post in the Pentagon and the White House. By 1953, continental air defenses included assets of five organizations, responsible to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff: *ADC's \\"SAGE radar stations, fighter interceptor squadrons, and the Air Defense Direction Center\\" *Army Antiaircraft Command (ARAACOM)'s AAA artillery, MIM-3 Nike Ajax surface-to-air missiles, and the network of fire control centers and target acquisition radars *Alaskan Air Command (AAC) with interceptors and radars at North America's northwest *Northeast Air Command (NEAC) of the USAF in northeast Canada and Thule Air Force Base, Greenland *Air Defence Command of the Royal Canadian Air Force with its interceptor aircraft and radars =USAF operational control= The United States Department of Defense agreed that the USAF would assume operational control of all U.S. air defense weapons during an attack. However, the Army complained the USAF command and control network (e.g., the 1950 Strategic Operational Control System (SOCS) telephone/teletype system was \\"insufficiently reliable.\\"Source identified in Citation 4 at Wainstein In response to the \\"enemy capabilities to inflict massive damage on the continental United States by surprise air attack\\", the National Security Council formulated President Dwight Eisenhower's \\"The New Look\\" strategy in 1953-54. To minimize the Soviet threat, the New Look strategy aimed to allow Strategic Air Command (SAC) bombers \\"to get into the air not be destroyed on the ground\\" to make massive retaliation possible.Joint Chiefs of Staff summary (cited by Schaffel p. 194)House of Commons of Canada transcript (quoted by Schaffel, p. 251 -- speaker not identified). Thus the major purpose of air defense was not actually to shoot down enemy bombers, but merely gain time for SAC to respond. Planning By October 16, 1953, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff requested the services' input regarding formation of a joint air defense command, but the USAF Chief of Staff on December 16, 1953 \\"concluded that no change was needed or advisable\\". (cited and quoted by Wainstein p. 198-9) Under \\"political pressures for greater unity and effectiveness in the national air defense system\\", the Chairman--a Navy Admiral‚Äîdisagreed with the USAF and in January 1954 \\"recommended that the JCS approve in principle the establishment of a joint air defense command\\":Memorandum from CJCS to JCS (CM 217-511 ), 15 Januarv 1954 (Citation 47 at Wainstein pp. 112, 136) :\\"In an era when enemy capabilities to inflict massive damage on the continental United States by surprise air attack are rapidly increasing, I consider that there is no doubt whatsoever as to the duty of the Joint Chiefs to establish a suitable \\"joint\\" command‚Ä¶. The command will be composed of forces of each of the services and provide for the coordinated accomplishment of functions of each of the services for the air defense of the United States.\\" The command was planned to include:Memorandum from Chairman JCS to Chiefs of Staff, CM-47-54 15 January 1954, Subject: \\"Command Arrangements for the Air Defense of the United States\\" (Citation 5 at Wainstein pp. 199,262) *all air forces regularly assigned to the air defense of the United States *land based early warning stations and sea-based forces assigned to contiguous radar coverage; *antiaircraft forces of the Army involved in the permanent air defense of the United States *the exercise of operational control of Army and Marine Corps units \\"which can temporarily augment the air defense forces in event of emergency.\\" *CINCLANT/CINCPAC and CINCAL/CINCNE responses as needed from their \\"seaward extensions of the early warning system‚Ä¶and early warning installations in Alaska and the NE Command\\". Operational control The Joint Chiefs directed the establishment of CONAD on August 2, 1954. The Secretary of Defense announced the command's formation publicly later in the month to integrate \\"the air defense capabilities of the three military departments into an air defense system responsible to the control of one military commander\\" (Wainstein). CONAD was established effective September 1, 1954, primarily to defend the continental United States against air attack. It was also tasked to support U.S. commanders in the Pacific, Atlantic, Caribbean, Alaska, Northeast, and of Strategic Air Command in their missions to the maximum extent consistent with its primary mission. ADC's commander, General Benjamin Chidlaw, became the first CINCONAD, and the USAF was designated as the executive agency. From 1954 to 1956, CONAD consisted of the USAF Air Defense Command, Army Antiaircraft Command, and the Naval Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (NAVFORCONAD). The USAF ADC Headquarters was additionally designated as Headquarters CONAD. CONAD's operational control covered: (Leonard p. 147 citation 306) # Direction of the tactical air battle # Control of fighters # Specifying the alert condition # Stationing early warning units # Deploying combat units of the command. ADC's main battle control center was moved out of the former hallway/latrine in the Ent AFB headquarters building and into a new-built blockhouse in 1954. At Ent, offices for both HQ CONAD and a new HQ NAVFORCONAD were prepared in the building with the ADC and ARAACOM HQs. NAVFORCONAD was placed under command of Rear Admiral Albert K. Morehouse.See also Guarding the Cold War Ramparts The Experimental SAGE Subsector received a prototype IBM computer in July 1955.http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0419183 for development of a \\"national air defense network\\", A late 1955 CONAD plan for USAF Semi-Automatic Ground Environment control of Army Nike missiles caused an interservice dispute but later in 1956 the Secretary of Defense approved CONAD's plan for USAF units at computerized Army nuclear bunkers. The 1959 Missile Master Plan resolved the dispute to have separate Nike Hercules missile command posts in the bunkers. On February 13, 1956, CINCONAD advocated \\"an eventual combined organization‚Ä¶of the Air Defense Force of all countries and services in and adjacent to North America.\\" December 1956 planning requested \\"six prime and 41 gap-tiller radars [to be] located in Mexico. By 1956, CONAD had designated 3 \\"SAC Base Complexes\\" to be defended: in the Northwestern United States, in a Montana-through-North Dakota area, and the largest in a nearly-triangular \\"South Central Area\\" from Minnesota to New Mexico to Northern Florida.Continental Air Defense Operations Plan (CADOP 56-66) submitted on 18 December 1956 and cited in Maloney's Learning to Love the Bomb =1956 reorganization= On September 4, 1956, the JCS changed the Terms of Reference for CONAD to be \\"more in line [with] ..a joint task force\\" and separated command of the USAF Air Defense Command from CINCONAD. The CONAD staff were separated from the ADC HQ staff on October 1, 1956.U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Terms of Reference for CINCONAD, Washington, D.C., 4 September 1956. The JCS also transferred \\"the air defense systems in Alaska and the Canadian Northeast\\" from those unified commands to CONAD. On January 1, 1957, CINCONAD placed the U.S. defenses in a geometric \\"Canadian Northeast Area\\" under the operational control of the Canadian Air Defence Command. In March 1957, CONAD said \\"that an adequate and timely defense system against the intercontinental ballistic missile was \\"the most urgent future CONAD requirement.\\"CONAD to C/S, USAF, \\"Defense Against Ballistic Missiles,\\" 7 Mar 1951 (p. 89 citation 6 in CONAD's 1956-7 Historical Summary) CONAD identified a requirement \\"for a defense against cruise and ballistic missiles launched from submarines or surface ships\\" on June 14, 1957CONAD to C/S, USAF, \\"Continental Air Defense Requirements,\\" 14 Jun 1951 (p. 89 citation 7 in CONAD's 1956-7 Historical Summary) The 1957 Gaither Report identified \\"little likelihood of SAC's bombers surviving since there was no way to detect an incoming attack until the first [ICBM] warhead landed\\". In keeping with these recommendations, the BMEWS General Operational Requirement was issued on November 7, 1957. On 6 September 1957, CONAD advised all appropriate agencies that the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) was to be established at Ent Air Force Base effective 0001 Zulu 12 September. This would integrate the headquarters of CONAD and RCAF ADC. General Earle E. Partridge, the CONAD/ADC commander, became Commander-in-Chief of NORAD. At the same time, Canadian officers agreed that the command's primary purpose would be \\"early warning and defense for SAC's retaliatory forces.\\" The CONAD blockhouse at Ent became a \\"master station\\" of the 1958 Alert Network Number 1, (ARDC's ADSMO was redesignated as the Air Defense Systems Integration Division on February 24, 1958.) Ground zero footage for CONAD was shot during the Operation Plowshare nuclear detonation.https://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2012/07/16/156851175/five-men- agree-to-stand-directly-under-an-exploding-nuclear-bomb When the ICBM threat had sufficiently developed, the June 1959 Continental Air Defense Program reduced the number of Super Combat Centers to 7, then all were cancelled on March 18, 1960. The Canadian nuclear bunker started at CFS North Bay was completed in 1963 with vacuum tube computers. The NORAD/CONAD Combined Operations Center at the Chidlaw Building in Colorado Springs. =Space defense= CONAD was assigned \\"operational command\\" of the Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS) on November 7, 1960.United States Air Force, Beyond Horizons SPADATS included Project Space Track and NAVSPASUR sensors. The \\"Improved Hercules system\\" for surface-to-air-missiles was first deployed in 1961, and in 1962 the command manned the alternate US command post (CONAD ALCOP) at Richards-Gebaur AFB. CONAD HQ moved from Ent AFB to the nearby Colorado Springs' Chidlaw Building in 1963, where a new NORAD/CONAD \\"war room\\" (Combined Operations Center) with Iconorama was used until the under- construction Command Center and Missile Warning Center became operational at Cheyenne Mountain Complex in 1966. NORAD HQ moved to the Chidlaw Building on February 15, 1963. The CONAD and NORAD offices were consolidated on March 7, 1963. CONAD agreed to allow the FAA to control military aircraft for \\"scramble, flight en route to target [enemy aircraft], and recovery\\" (handed off to military directors for actual intercept) effective February 1, 1964.https://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf By January 12, 1965, CONAD had a \\"Space Defense Center Implementation Plan\\"NORAD to ADC, \\"(U) NORAD/CONAD Space Defense Center Implementation Plan,\\" 12 Jan 1965 (cited by Jan-Jun 1966 NORAD/CONAD Historical Summary) (in 1967 the 1st Aero moved Ent's Space Defense Center operations to Cheyenne Mountain Complex's Group III Space Defense Center.) CONAD continued using the same name with \\"air defense\\" after Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) was designated the new USAF \\"space\\" command name in 1968 with most of CONAD's missile warning and space surveillance assets (cf. the 1959 Naval Space Surveillance System until transferred to the USAF in 2004). Aftermath BOMARC alerts ended in 1972, and the post-Vietnam war drawdown closed most CONUS NIKE missile sites during the 1974 Project Concise. At the very end of the command's existence, the SAFEGUARD ABM system was being deployed. It became operational on October 1, 1975. CONAD was disestablished on June 30, 1975. General Lucius D. Clay Jr., the last commander, remained Commander-in-Chief of NORAD, and Aerospace Defense Command personnel manned combined NORAD/ADCOM staff organizations. ADCOM was broken up 1979-80 with interceptors transferring to Air Defense, Tactical Air Command, missile warning stations transferring to SAC (e.g., the new PAVE PAWS sites), electronics units transferring to the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS), and the NORAD/ADCOM \\"Air Force Element\\" forming the new Aerospace Defense Center. Remaining ADCOM HQ functions continued as combined NORAD/ADCOM organizations, e.g., \\"HQ NORAD/ADCOM\\" J31 subsequently manned the Cheyenne Mountain Space Surveillance Center in the same room as the Missile Warning Center, separated by partitions. In 1982, the Aerospace Defense Center was incorporated into the new Air Force Space Command.

Schrodt is currently a senior research scientist at the statistical consulting firm Parus Analytical Systems. Biography Schrodt received an M.A. in mathematics and a Ph.D. in political science from Indiana University in 1976. He worked at Northwestern University for 12 years, then at Kansas University for 21 years, and at Pennsylvania State University for 4 years, before leaving academia for a private sector job with Parus Analytical Systems. Academic work Schrodt's work has largely been focused on automated coding of event data for political news. In 1994, he created the Kansas Event Data System (KEDS) that won the ‚ÄúOutstanding Computer Software Award‚Äù from the American Political Science Association in 1995. In 2000, he created the Textual Analysis by Augmented Replacement Instructions (TABARI) software in 2000 that improved on the KEDS. He developed the Conflict and Mediation Event Observations (CAMEO) data coding framework along with Deborah J. Gerner and others. The TABARI software could automatically code event data according to the CAMEO framework. A modification of TABARI, called JABARI-NLP, was used for the Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS) database by Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories. TABARI and CAMEO are also used for event coding for the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, that Schrodt co-created with Kalev Leetaru and others. Logistic regression models created by Schrodt were also successfully incorporated into the predictive algorithms used by Lockheed Martin for ICEWS.

Founded in 1962, this Traditional Judaism congregation is one of the largest and most influential synagogues of Amazonian Jews in the Northern Brazil. The Jewish Labour Zionist youth movement Habonim Dror is established in Manaus and it is part of the Community. The construction was financed by the local entrepreneurs Isaac Benayon Sabb√°, Samuel Benchimol, Jos√© Benzecry and Moyses Israel Benaros. Service Times Beit Yaacov/Rabi Meyr Synagogue conducts weekly Friday night and Saturday morning, Shabat services. Services are generally at 6:30 p.m. on Friday evening and 9:00 a.m. on Saturday morning. The Synagogue also offers services throughout each holiday including Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Pessach. The Community also celebrates Yom Ha'Atzmaut, Yom HaShoah, Yom Hazikaron, Yom Yerushalayim, Mimouna and the Hilulot, celebrations linked to the commemoration of great rabbis and tzadikim of Morocco. For security reasons, Jewish tourists and groups of Jewish tourists (with or without guide) wishing to participate in the religious services of the Synagogue must inform the Community in advance. History About 900 miles inland from the Atlantic, Manaus is the capital of the state of Amazonas, in northwest Brazil. Of the city's 2.0 million people, roughly 800 are Jewish, according to Isaac Dahan, the local synagogue's cantor. The Jewish community of Manaus dates from about 1890, when Jews were fleeing poverty and uncertain life in Morocco and when Brazil was experiencing a rubber boom. The smuggling of seeds for rubber trees out of Brazil to England in 1876 and the successful planting of seedlings in Indonesia and Ceylon eventually helped cause the bubble to burst. The 'Jewish Saint' In 1908, following instructions from then Chief Rabbi of Morocco, Rephael Anc√°ua, Rabbi Shalom Imanuel Muyal traveled to Amazon in order to verify the situation of hundreds of families of Moroccan Jews which started emigrating in 1810. In 1910, Rabbi Shalom Imanuel Muyal died of yellow fever and is buried in the Manaus Catholic Cemetery. He has come to be regarded as a saint by many in the local non-Jewish population, who make regular pilgrimages to his gravesite. Local Christians in the Amazonian city have made it a tradition to turn up at Muyal's burial spot in the Saint John the Baptist Cemetery to pray for miracles. When their prayers are answered, they put up small signs of thanks.

The industrialization as well as lax environmental oversight have contributed to the problems. The various forms of pollution have increased as Karachi which has caused widespread environmental and health problems. Air pollution, lack of proper waste management infrastructure and degradation of water bodies are the major environmental issues in Karachi. Biota Climate Geography Water Climate change Pollution Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. According to a study by National Institutes of Health, chromium and lead levels are high in almost all ground water sources, however extremely high concentrations were found in industrial areas. Presence of any one of the heavy metal contamination necessitate the need for the estimation of other heavy metals as significant positive correlation was found between chromium and lead concentration, indicating the possibility of similar contamination sources in Karachi.Drinking water quality in Karachi Coast Pollution The Karachi coastline, which stretches over 135 km, is facing severe pollution due to a combination of industrial, port, municipal, and transportation activities in the area. The coastline is being overwhelmed with water-borne pollution being discharged in the shipping process into the marine environment. A recent study found that some of the marine life was contaminated with lead, which if consumed by humans through seafood, has been linked to anemia, kidney failure and brain damage. In fact, the study also discovered that even the mangrove forests protecting the feeder creeks from sea erosion as well as a source of sustenance for fishermen are threatened by this pollution.The Karachi Coastline Case In the Korangi Industrial Area, 2,500 industrial units including 170 tanneries dispose untreated waste into the Arabian Sea.Water Pollution due toIndustrial Waste Air pollution Air pollution is the release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM10 to PM2.5. The air in Karachi is polluted by automobile smoke, especially rickshaws and buses, industrial emissions, open burning of garbage, house fires, and other particles but the government and environment organizations do not seem to take the issue seriously or in a timely manner. =Rickshaws= The two-stroke engine on rickshaws and motorcycles are one of the major polluters of air in Karachi and rest of Pakistan. The two-stroke engines, as well as defective or poorly maintained vehicles, are major polluters by producing carbon dioxide emissions. Two-stroke engines as well as defective vehicles using substandard lubricant are major emitters of sulfur dioxide and smoke. Automobiles operating on compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas are major air polluters.Rising air pollution badly affecting Karachiites Light pollution The Light pollution includes light trespass, over-illumination and astronomical interference. Light pollution is the presence of anthropocentric and artificial light in the night environment. It is exacerbated by excessive, misdirected or obtrusive use of light, but even carefully used light fundamentally alters natural conditions Littering Littering is the criminal throwing of inappropriate man-made objects, unremoved, onto public and private properties. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation have suffered due to mismanaged administrative and financial affairs and are now facing serious difficulties in discharging basic duties such as collection and disposal of municipal garbage from important residential areas.Karachi becoming a large garbage bin as waste management woes persist Noise pollution Noise pollution which encompasses roadway noise, aircraft noise, industrial noise as well as high-intensity sonar. The noise for Karachi came to 80 dB (A), the General Noise Index x (G.N.I.) to 460, and the noise pollution level (N.P.L.) to 99 dB (A). These values are significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than the available international data. The sources of noise production were identified as, the road traffic, human activity, industrial and civil works, mechanical and engineering workshops. The most noticeable sources of noise pollution in Karachi, are the autorickshaws, trail motor bikes and the fag horns of public transport. The noise emanating from a wide variety of sources such as; Motorcycles, Auto-Rikshaws, Cars, Wagons, Mini-buses & Buses, Trucks, Tractors, Water tankers, Bulldozers and Machine drills etc.Traffic Noise Pollution in Karachi Soil contamination Soil contamination occurs when chemicals are released by spill or underground leakage. Among the most significant soil contaminants are hydrocarbons, heavy metals, MTBE,Concerns about MTBE from U.S. EPA website herbicides, pesticides and chlorinated hydrocarbons. =Naya Nazimabad Contamination= The Naya Nazimabad a neighbourhood of Karachi was developed on contaminated soil resulting in serious health issues for the residents. There has been a coverup to downplay the contamination of Naya Nazimabad in Pakistan's media. Shunaid Qureshi, developer of Naya Nazimabad, CEO Al Abbas Sugar Mills and former Chairman of Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PASMA) were arrested in January 2014. The Javedan Cement Limited (JCL) was privatized and sold at very low prices of Rs. 4.3 billion ($43 million) to Haji Ghani and Shunaid Qureshi. The new owners almost immediately stopped production, dismantled the cement factory and converted the 1,300 acres JCL land into Naya Nazimabad housing project worth over Rs. 100 billion ($1 billion). Radioactive contamination Radioactive contamination resulting from 20th century activities in atomic physics, such as nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons research, manufacture and deployment. (See alpha emitters and actinides in the environment). The Karachi Nuclear Power Complex is located 50 km from Karachi downtown. The KANUPP-1 is a 137 MW CANDU reactor. There are two 1100 MW each CAP1400 Nuclear reactors under construction. In November 2013, Pakistan and China confirmed that CAP1400 Nuclear reactor, based on AP1000 Westinghouse Electric Company Pressurized water reactor, will be built at Karachi.With Reactor Deal, China and Pakistan Seek to Reshape Global Nuclear Governance Questions are also raised about the design model of the proposed Karachi power plants. It has been claimed that the design of the Karachi plants, the ACP-I000, is still under development and thus untried and untested.Nuclear safety in Karachi Thermal pollution Thermal pollution is a temperature change in natural water bodies caused by human influence, such as use of water as coolant in a power plant. Visual pollution Visual pollution, which can refer to the presence of overhead power lines, motorway billboards, scarred landforms (as from strip mining), open storage of trash, municipal solid waste or space debris. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has imposed a ban on installing new advertising billboards, signboards and other hoardings in the metropolitan for the next three months. The decision was taken in a meeting of KMC‚Äôs senior officials after the corporation took notice of visual pollution blighting the landscape of the city.KMC says no to ‚Äòvisual pollution‚Äô There are over 3,000 billboards in Karachi causing visual pollution.The story of Karachi's billboards Water pollution Water pollution id by the discharge of wastewater from commercial and industrial waste (intentionally or through spills) into surface waters; discharges of untreated domestic sewage, and chemical contaminants, such as chlorine, from treated sewage; release of waste and contaminants into surface runoff flowing to surface waters (including urban runoff and agricultural runoff, which may contain chemical fertilizers and pesticides); waste disposal and leaching into groundwater; eutrophication and littering. 110 million gallons per day of raw, untreated water from the Indus River is mixed with treated water from the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB)‚Äôs water treatment plants, and this mixed water is supplied to the city. The KWSB claims that this water is fit for consumption. The quantity of chlorine has also been increased to ensure that all sorts of bacteria and germs are eliminated.Environmental hazard: Karachi‚Äôs garbage piles up as coffers empty Karachi has drinking water pollution and inaccessibility. There is dissatisfaction with garbage disposal in Karachi. Instead of disposing garbage at the solid waste management plant, the people have been throwing and burning it at various residential and commercial points in the city, causing immense pollution.Drinking water quality in Karachi =Tanning= Pakistan exports leather product using Leather production processes including tanning. In addition to the other environmental impacts of leather, the production processes have a high environmental impact, most notably due to: * the heavy use of polluting chemicals in the tanning process * air pollution due to the transformation process (hydrogen sulfide during dehairing and ammonia during deliming, solvent vapours). One tonne of hide or skin generally leads to the production of 20 to 80 m3 of turbid and foul-smelling wastewater, including chromium levels of 100‚Äì400 mg/L, sulfide levels of 200‚Äì800 mg/L and high levels of fat and other solid wastes, as well as notable pathogen contamination. Pesticides are also often added for hide conservation during transport. With solid wastes representing up to 70% of the wet weight of the original hides, the tanning process comes at a considerable strain on water treatment installations. =Industrial= Karachi‚Äôs industries generate a cocktail of chemicals and toxic substances, and a significant amount of industrial effluent is discharged into creeks, rivers, or the sea. =Textile= Pakistan exports textile products and the Textile mill effluents is causing huge pollution of its water. Textile mill effluents (TMEs) are wastewater discharges from textile mills that are involved in wet processes such as scouring, neutralizing, desizing, mercerizing, carbonizing, fulling, bleaching, dyeing, printing and other wet finishing activities. They are not generated at facilities that conduct only dry processing (carding, spinning, weaving and knitting), laundering or manufacturing of synthetic fibres through chemical processes. Environmental Management Environmental management comprises two terms: environment and management. So at first, we have to know, what management is. Then we can easily understand about the environmental management. Management is the process of planning, designing, controlling, coordinating, staffing or leading to acquire a desired objective. At first, one views about management functionally, such as measuring quantity, adjusting plans, meeting goals. This applies even in situation where planning does not take place. From this perspective, Henri Fayol considers management to consist of six functions: Whatever, everyday we are managing everything, every idea. It leads the proper to reach the desired goal. Environmental management system is a systematic approach of planning, designing, coordinating, leading and controlling all the activities and what objectives/ functions of any entity to have a desired outcome in terms of enhancing environmental quality. Objectives of Environmental Management From a practical point of view, * We want a healthy living environment. To ensure it we have to remove all kinds of pollution or environmental media. In situ management: where we find problem, we manage here. * Separate the source and receptor and keep a buffer zone between them as it works like sink. This zone can be physical or by distances. Its goal is to create buffer zone. * Forecasting * Planning * Organizing * Commanding * Coordinating * Controlling Environmental issues See also * Environmental issues in Pakistan * Environmental issues in Siachen * Geography of Pakistan * Health care in Pakistan * List of environmental issues * Protected areas of Pakistan * Wildlife of Pakistan References External links * Nontraditional Security Threats in Pakistan by Ali Tauqeer Sheikh (October 2011) * Ecological and Nontraditional Security Challenges in South Asia by Dennis Pirages, Farooq Sobhan, Stacy D.

A work breakdown structure (WBS) in project management and systems engineering is a deliverable-oriented decomposition of a project into smaller components into a tree structure that represents how the work of the project will create the components of the final product. Resources and cost are typically inserted into the activities in a WBS, and summed to create a budget both for summary levels (often called \\"work packages\\") and for the whole project or program. Similarly, the expected value-added of each activity and/or component of the project (or projects within a program) are inserted into the VBS. In most projects (and programs), there are some components and activities (and projects) that are mandatory and others that are optional. Mandatory activities are required, and have the full value of the project investment, as the project cannot be completed without them. In contrast, optional activities have only the value that they are adding to the project, i.e., their value is equal to the delta between the project/program value if they are included and the value if they are omitted. For example, in creating an automobile, an engine, a driveshaft and wheels may all be considered mandatory, whereas cupholders are optional. If any of the mandatory activities are excluded, the project's value approaches zero. But the value of the cupholders is only the difference between the value of the car with and without cupholders. The value from the VBS should also be used as the basis for tracking project value through Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP). If scope is changed during execution, that change should be input into the VBS, the numerator in computing the Actual DIPP adjusted, and the DIPP Progress Index thus updated. Unlike cost, which can be summed up the branches of a WBS to provide an overall budget, value cannot similarly be summed in a VBS. If the value of an automobile is $25,000, there are many components and activities that are mandatory in generating that value ‚Äì leave any of them out, and the value of the project approaches zero. Therefore, the fact that the engine, driveshaft and wheels are all mandatory, and each therefore has a value-added of $25,000 does NOT make the value of the automobile $75,000. The main purpose of the VBS is to prioritize components and work by the value they are expected to add, and to ensure that the value of the project investment is not reduced by the inclusion of work which has a value-added that is less than its true cost, which is the sum of its resource costs and its drag cost. This can often happen if the project's critical path changes so that different activities suddenly acquire critical path drag and drag cost: an optional activity that adds $10,000 to the expected value of the project and has a budget of $5,000 may make sense when it can be performed off the critical path but should probably be jettisoned if on the critical path if they now have a negative value-added due to a drag cost of more than $5,000.

The silent film features a detective named Hemlock Hoax who tries to solve a murder, which unbeknownst to him is a practical joke being played on him by two young boys. It was one of many shorts designed to derive its humor from a sleuth whose name was similar to Sherlock Holmes. The character of Hemlock Hoax was based on a minor character from a film story that had been rejected. The finished film was released in April as a split reel, being presented with two other Lubin comedies. The black-and-white short received positive reviews with several journalists praising the film's humor. It is unclear whether there is a surviving print of the film, and the identities of the film's cast and crew are not recorded. Plot Hemlock Hoax is a detective who has little respect in the small tropical town where he lives, despite the fact that he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.

Kampung Cina is located along Jalan Bandar (formerly known as Jalan Kampung Cina), in Kuala Terengganu city centre at the river mouth of Terengganu River that empties into the South China Sea. Kampung Cina literally means Chinese Village; it is also called Teng Lang Po or KT's Chinatown by local people. It is one of Southeast Asia's early Chinese settlements and contains stately ancestral homes, temples, townhouses, and business establishments. The town is small but has colourful shophouses along both sides of the road that carries traditional flavour. Kuala Terengganu's Chinatown was first established by the Chinese community in the late 19th century. It was once a hub for commercial activities that helped shape Kuala Terengganu into what it is today. The Chinese built the traditionally designed shop houses according to their place of origin in China. History The narrow road of Kampung Cina Kampung Cina, Chinatown of Kuala Terengganu is the main Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, situated near the heart of Kuala Terengganu city centre. In 1719, the Chinese village settlement had more than 1000 house compared from its today row of pre-war Chinese shop houses of that which only dated as far as 200-year or its earlier dated that are recorded by foreigners like Alexander Hamilton and Captain Joseph Jackson who visited the Chinese settlement while in the Kuala Terengganu town during 1719, and other like J. Newbold in 1893, Munshi Abdullah in 1836, and more. The great fire in early 1880s destroyed a large part of the area and subsequently, many of the houses were rebuilt. The exact date of the founding of Kampung Cina is not clearly known as no archaeology dig was ever made, as to preserve the Kampung Cina site which is now a part of the city. Many who live here may be descended from the first Chinese who arrive and settled here at Terengganu since the 16th century. Thus many of its occupants treat their house as an ancestral home which has much history after being handed down from generation to generation. Nowadays, preservation and modification projects are carried out on many of the old buildings. =Evidence of the early presence of Chinese settlers in Kampung Cina= When Alexander Hamilton and Captain Joseph Jackson visited Kuala Terengganu in 1719‚Äì20 and 1764 respectively, the presence of Chinese settlers was noted down in their records. Alexander wrote: According to the Malay scholar Munshi Abdullah, who visited Kuala Terengganu in 1836, there was a large Chinese quarter with a Kapitan Cina (Chinese leader) named Kapitan Lim Eng Huat (1798-1847), who was the third Kapitan of Chinatown. He probably saw the concrete bridge being built during Sultan Mohammad's period (1837-1839) because in his second visit here, Munshi wrote about the bridge in 1838. Kuala Terengganu was also described by Thomas John Newbold in 1839: A view of Kampung Cina. Various Chinese records and annals - dated as far back as the 10th century (Song Dynasty) have referred to the ports of Terengganu. Javanese records of the Kingdom of Majapahit in the 14th century also placed Kuala Terengganu on their list of trading centres. But no one really know the exact dated of the Chinese settlement in Kampung Cina. It is only certain with evidence that the Chinese settlement may started in Terengganu after Admiral Cheng Ho (Zheng He) of China return to China between 1419AD to 1719AD or maybe before or around the time of Alexander Hamilton and Captain Joseph Jackson who visited Kuala Terengganu in 1719‚Äì1720. It is believed that Admiral Cheng Ho (Zheng He) of China - the Goodwill Ambassador of the Ming Dynasty - led a huge fleet of about 200 vessels with approximately 28,000 marine officers and crew to the shores of Kuala Terengganu in the year of 1414 AD. This is based on evidence from a map of places visited by Cheng Ho, during his fourth trip to the west. Right after the visit of Cheng Ho/Zheng He, Chinese farmers from the coast of China, especially the people from Zhangzhou District of Hokkien Province sail to Terengganu first settled at Bukit Datu (Big City), and along the river bank of Nerus River. The Chinese's forefathers in Terengganu named Nerus River as Sampokang (Cheng Ho's River) and built a temple at Kampung Jeram - Sampokong Keramat Cheng Ho. The Chinese population of Chinatown mainly did their trade in the waterfront area. These settlers were engaged in trades through concessions from the state rulers, and among their businesses included the sale and bartering of crafts such as textiles, metalwork, and woodwork from the nearby Malay communities, and commercial trades, imports, and exports of goods (such as silks, gambir, camphor, pepper, and gold) from local or foreign places. By the mid-1800s, with the booming of the tin mining and industries, the Chinese population of Kuala Terengganu and the whole Malaya increased tremendously as new Chinese immigrants arrived here for work. Kuala Terengganu, which is strategically located on the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia, was a natural stopping point for those who plied the trade route from China to South East Asia in the early days. Those who fall in love with this enchanted land simply stay on while the rest, sail on to fulfill their own destiny, in places like Perak and Kuala Lumpur for tin mining. Kampung Cina became the most densely populated area for the Chinese community in Kuala Terengganu. Architecture The decorative fa√ßade of one of the shophouses Chinatown was opened about 300 years ago by the traders from Southern China and was the first area for business and trading in Kuala Terengganu, although in its current form, the oldest building (many of which are shophouses) dates back from the late 1800s. Today, there are about 270 pre-war Chinese shophouses. Many of these shophouses were originally built with brick, plaster, and timber. Currently, due to the old age of these structures, refurbishments and renovations are carried out to a number of buildings. The early Chinese residents chose to build the shophouses near the bank of Terengganu River since the location provides a place for junks and ships to harbour. Like a typical Chinatown in other Malaysian states, the buildings incorporate various styles such as traditional Southern Chinese designs, Neoclassical, or Art Deco. The fa√ßades of these shophouses differ according to their styles. Neoclassical buildings, for instance, are rather elaborate and ornate in its decorations, while older buildings are generally bare and simple. The entrance to Ho Ann Kiong Temple. Each shophouse of Chinatown is not singular building. Instead, many different shophouses are connected to one another and form one long structure. A number of back alleys separate these structures. The shophouses in Chinatown are both commercial and private structures, mostly two storeys high. Families who own business establishments (such as sundry shop, light industry, or warehouse) usually will use the ground floor for the business and trade and reside on the upper floor. The common element of many of these shophouses is the covered passageway in front of the buildings known as kaki lima or the 'five-foot-way'. The name comes from the original prescribed width of the passageway, which is five feet, although later regulations prescribed a width of seven and a half feet. Culture The 'kaki lima' or five-foot-way in Chinatown, Kuala Terengganu. This is a typical feature of Malaysian Chinatowns. The culture in Chinatown has been one that is an admixture of the Malay and Chinese traditions and lifestyles. Chinese traditions and customs can be found everywhere in this place and Chinese new year is celebrated widely by the Chinese residents. The influence of local Malay culture in Terengganu also gave rise to the small Peranakan community locally known as Mek and Awang. This community is quite similar to the Penang and Malacca counterparts known as Baba and Nyonya, but still retains its own uniqueness and differences. Mek and Awang community is centred in two main places, Chinatown, and Kampung Tiruk, a village about 14 km from Kuala Terengganu. Similar to Baba and Nyonya in Penang and Malacca, the traditional costume of the Terengganuese Peranakan women is a special type of Kebaya known as Kebaya potong kot. Ornamental broidery is typical of this Kebaya. The Chinese dishes (especially the Peranakan dishes) are influenced by the local East Coast culture. Among the influence is the usage of budu), a fish sauce made from anchovies. Local Chinese or Peranakan dishes that can be found here include ayam pachok, akok, rojak ceranang, roti paung dan pulut lepa. The kopitiams, cafes and restaurants that are available here offer local delicacies, mostly Chinese, but also Malay and Indian food. As the name implies, the residents and business traders of Chinatown are mostly Chinese although nowadays, there are other Malay or Indian traders. Small grocery shops, butcher shops, hardware shops, kopitiams (literally means coffee shops), cafes, restaurants and so on can be found there. Many of the businesses have been operating here for decades and are handed down to the new generations of traders. Attractions In the year 2004, The Government declared that Kampung Cina's various historical structures and area was to be gazetted as a heritage site of Terengganu. As a significant area of the city's Chinese community, it is home to two Chinese temples, Ho Ann Kiong and Tien Hou Kong, which was built in 1801 and 1896. Ho Ann Kiong contains a statue of the Goddess of the sea, Mazu. Unfortunately, a fire broke out that ultimately destroyed 60% of the temple. A restoration was carried out and now Ho Ann Kiong functions again. Another landmark is the 19th-century Low Tiey water well, erected in 1875. It was believed to have been excavated and constructed in 1875 by Low Tiey Lim Keng Hoon (1820-1882) as a public service to the community. It was built with two separate bathing chambers for men and women with a six-metre high wall. After years and years, it still supplies clean water to Chinatown's residents. Many of the buildings here have undergone restoration or beautification programmes to make them more appealing, but without destroying the heritage value. While the shophouses still retain their distinctive characteristics, they are now brighter and livelier. One can still see repair works being carried out on several shophouses. Murals can be found in many sections of the area. The recent attractions in Kampung Cina are its back alleys, many of which are transformed into thematic lanes. For example, Turtle Alley, the narrowest back lane, has information related to various turtles and turtle-themed wall and floor mosaics. Tauke Wee Seng Hee Cultural Lane is another such thematic lane. This alley showcases an old, colonial-era telephone booth and a classic cast iron post box (still in use) painted in bright red. The walls also displays a collection of old signs from shops in Chinatown and several Han Dynasty-era poems. These lanes have become tourist and photography spots. Kampung Cina is also known for its local delicacies such as roti paung, a special local bread, durian cake, pulut 'dipa' and the white keropok lekor, which is made of wolf herring or ikan parang. Many local Chinese dishes, along with other Malay and Indian fares, can be found in the restaurants and food courts located here. As per usual with many other cities in Malaysia, modern restaurants and cafes are also available. Image gallery File:KT Chinatown 1.jpgThe shophouses near Pasar Besar Kedai Payang.

Personal life  Crews was born to Stephen and Ruth Batson in 1920 and she was one of four children. Crews considered herself very fortunate to be born into an upper- middle-class family, as well as, parents that allowed her to be outside the Southern belle ideal. Her mother instilled Southern values but allowed Crews to be who she wanted to be. She wanted to fly since she saw Charles Lindbergh in Birmingham. Additionally, Crews was an excellent athlete during her youth, she participated in horseback riding and golf. During high school, Crews was on the cheerleading team. At the University of Alabama, Crews was elected to the highest coed office. In 1941, she graduated from University of Alabama. On February 1, 1946 she married Paul Crews and together they had three children, Paul, Radford, and Elinor. Finally, what was originally believed to be pneumonia was actually lung cancer which caused Crews' death on January 14, 2001.  Time in WAFS  In August 1943, WAFS was changed to WASP.[Women Airforce Service Pilots] (WASP) was created because Col. William H. Tunner commander of the Ferrying Division needed so many ferry pilots that he was willing to allow trained women to perform the job. In 1944, Crews graduated from pursuit school. Crews' assignment was to ferry P-47s from the factory to embarkation points to later be moved to war zones. She often would travel one coast to the other at heights up to four miles high at three hundred miles per hour. She was one of the first twenty-eight women to pilot a United States plane in World War II.  Life after WASP  While Crews stopped flying between 1949 and 1959 because her children were young, she continued to fly for most of her life. During the 1960s, Crews and her Super Club created a flying business. Through her business, she learned to how fly gliders and later became an instructor. In her seventies, she created a land and home development business. She was the first president of WAFS post-war organization between the year 1972‚Äì1975. Additionally, she was elected mayor of California City for one term in 1978. Also, she served one term as the St. Claire County Airport Commissioner. At seventy-nine, Crews co-piloted a corporate turbojet for almost eighty hours.  Awards and recognition  In 1989, Crews was inducted into the Alabama Aviation Hall of Fame. In 1997, a plaque with her name was placed outside of Forest of Friendship. In 2004, she was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame. Finally, on March 10, 2010 Crews and the WASPs as a whole received a Congressional Gold Medal. Crews' uniform, Mooney Mite, and first logbook are kept at the Southern Museum of Flight in Alabama.

Plot Former model Dana Griffin (Smith) invites her best friend Barbara (Eikenberry) and her family over to San Francisco to attend her wedding to multimillionaire business tycoon Ted Marshall (Mason). Ted thinks that Dana is pregnant of his baby, but Barbara quickly finds out that Dana is lying about being pregnant. She initially tries to persuade Dana to tell the truth, but Dana convinces her to keep quiet, as she is pursuing to ultimately give Ted what he wishes for. Shortly after the wedding, Ted tries to surprise Dana at her so-called appointment with her doctor, only to find out about the scheme. Devastated, he tells her on their yacht that he will have the marriage annulled. In an act of desperation and outrage, Dana then pushes Ted off the yacht and watches as he drowns. She then quickly calls the police, lying about the cause of his drowning. Shortly after Ted's death, she receives a visit from his best friend, lawyer Jay (Sanford). Jay was contacted by Ted about the annulment and openly suspects Dana from having killed her husband. Because of Jay's suspicion, Dana waves all rights to his estate and moves in with Babara and her family in New Hampshire. It does not take long before she starts cause friction between Barbara and her husband Alex (Irwin). At dinner, Dana reminds Barbara that Alex was not there for her when she gave birth to their - now 13-year-old - daughter Kate (Warnat), and later she plants one of her earrings in Alex's closet that Barbara ultimately finds. Barbara's friend Molly Butler (Place) does not like Dana, because she knows that Dana slept with Alex when she was 19 years old and when he was already engaged to Barbara. In bed, Alex admits to Barbara that even though he has the supposedly perfect life, he still feels lonely and empty inside. Dana overhears the conversation through a voice recorder that she has secretly installed in their bedroom, and uses the information to grow closer to Alex by making up a story of being lonely as well. They kiss shortly, and are caught by their housemaid Rose (Elliott). Barbara meanwhile decides to work on her marriage and family, and is worried that both Alex and Kate instead prefer to spend their time with Dana. She asks Dana to spend less time with Alex, but he is outraged when he finds out and leaves the home. Feeling mistreated, Barbara acts out by cutting his parachute with a knife. She then orders Rose to replace it, but she forgets. Later that evening, Dana lures Barbara away by lying that Kate is in the hospital, making sure that she is not present when throwing a surprise party for Alex. They get drunk and spend the night together, and the next morning Dana is already making plans to get married, when Alex tells her that he has no interest in being with her and has had made a mistake. Barbara catches the couple in bed, and confronts Dana with all her schemes. Dana then reveals that the abortion she had twenty years earlier, was from Alex's child. Barbara leaves heartbroken, and Alex is about to follow her when Dana shoots her gun on him. Alex ultimately overpowers Dana and then leaves to go parachute jumping. Because of being cut up, the parachute does not open during the fall, and Alex dies. Initially, Barbara is questioned as the perpetrator for cutting up the parachute, but through her own voice recorder device, all of Dana's schemes, including murdering Ted, is put to light as the police are present.

The association wants to raise awareness for women and close the gender gap. For example, research has shown that in businesses, women have less than one-fifth of a chance to get promoted and move up the company. History Before the official Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association was established, it was originally called the Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Federation that wanted to raise awareness for women's education, human rights, and equality of income. In doing so, they got participants from Prairie Women's Gathering and the Vancouver Island Women's retreat which finally got them a pre-conference workshop in Victoria. At this meeting, many women were attracted to this organization and many Canadian women were there. From there, they changed the name to Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association and is officially the first national women movement in Canada. Mission The Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association main mission is to raise awareness of women history. In the past years, women weren't acknowledged for their works that they contributed to society. The Association aims to change the attitudes society placed on women and inform our society of the issues that women have dealt with on a national and international level. Women have always faced a gender wage gap from men and deserves to get paid equally for their contributions. In addition, the Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association wants to circulate educational learning materials that highlight their work to prove to others of their contributions. Women deserve to be equal to any other human being and deserve more recognition. Objectives The women's movement hopes to have access to the women members in the congregation of their contributions, roles, and responsibilities that are affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist in Canada. In addition, the movement hopes to achieve other women individuals to step up and join this organization. The Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association are hosting annual meetings located in Host City or the Canadian Unitarian Council Annual Conference and hopes others will come out to support it.

The company was famous for making well-known brands of chocolate, including Kit Kat, Aero and Quality Street. The company was purchased by Nestl√© in 1988, which rebranded many products under its own brand. Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery also owned John Mackintosh Co.'s former headquarters and factory. The Halifax-based factory is still used today, located next to Halifax railway station for the production of Quality Street and more. Rowntree's former factory and headquarters were in York. Nestle has invested more than ¬£200 million in the Rowntree's business since 1988, making the York site one of the world's largest confectionery factories. Nestle's global research centre for confectionery is also based here, and recently doubled in size following a ¬£7 million investment. History =Victorian era= In 1862, Rowntree's was founded at Castlegate, in York by Henry Isaac Rowntree, as the company manager bought out the Tuke family.History of Nestl√© Rowntree In 1864 Rowntree acquired an old iron foundry at Tanners Moat for ¬£1,000, and moved production there. In 1869 the factory was staffed by 12 men. By 1869 Rowntree was in financial difficulties and his brother, Joseph Rowntree, joined him in full partnership, and H.I. Rowntree & Co was formally established. In 1881, Rowntree introduced Fruit Pastilles, competing against French imports of the time, and the product proved to be a great success, accounting for about 25 percent of the company's tonnage by 1887. This success allowed the company to invest in a Van Houten press, which enabled it to produce chocolate with the cocoa butter removed, in order to compete with Cadbury's successful Cocoa Essence. In the 1890s, Rowntree transformed from a small family business into a large-scale manufacturer, as sales more than quadrupled due to an increased demand among the public for confectionery. Six years after Rowntree's formation in 1868 John Mackintosh Co. was formed. In 1889, Seebohm Rowntree established a small research and testing laboratory for analysing ingredients and rival company products. In 1890, in order to cater for this increased demand, Rowntree acquired a 20-acre site at Haxby Road on the outskirts of York. The Tanners Moat site had become too small for Rowntree's needs, and the company had noted the success of Cadbury's purpose-built factory in Bournville. In 1893, the company introduced Rowntree's Fruit Gums. By 1897, the unlimited partnership needed external funding for its expansion, and became a public limited liability company called Rowntree & Co. Robert Fitzgerald has accused the company of being slow in new product development and marketing compared to its major competitor of the period, Cadbury. Fitzgerald suggests that Joseph Rowntree imitated the successes of competitors, (Cadbury's Cocoa Essence, French fruit pastilles) and that under his leadership, the company did not introduce any innovations of its own. Around 1898, the company acquired its own cocoa plantations in the West Indies. In 1899, Rowntree introduced its first milk chocolate block. However, the company failed to match the quality of Swiss competitors such as Lindt. In 1904 Mackintosh established his first overseas factory at Asbury Park, New Jersey which, however, soon failed. Undeterred, a factory was opened in 1906 at Krefeld, near D√ºsseldorf. By 1914, operations had been established in Australia and Canada, and John Mackintosh Ltd employed some 1,000 people.[1] =1900 to 1945= Rowntree had struggled to make a milk chocolate product of comparable quality or value to Cadbury's Dairy Milk. Joseph Rowntree even described the growing market for milk chocolate as a fad. Rowntree's poor performance in the category became a major problem from 1914 onwards, as British public preference continued to move towards milk chocolate, and away from the more bitter cocoa essence products. Rowntree's two major rivals, Cadbury and Fry, merged in 1918, and although Rowntree was invited to partake in the merger, the company declined to do so. Meanwhile, the Rowntree board was torn as to whether it should become a low turnover, high quality product company or a mass producer of cheaper lines. Seebohm Rowntree inherited a struggling company when he succeeded his father as chairman in 1923. By 1930, as a result of all its problems Rowntree was approaching bankruptcy. In 1926, Cowan's of Toronto, Canada, was acquired for $1 million. From 1931 Rowntree of Canada began to manufacture Mackintosh toffees under license. In 1927, the company began to market its fruit gums, and its pastilles from 1928, in the now familiar tube packaging. George Harris was appointed marketing manager for chocolate bars in January 1931.Oxford DNB Harris had learned the latest marketing techniques whilst in America. According to academic Robert Fitzgerald, \\"It was Harris's drive and insight which inspired his firm's renaissance in the 1930s\\". In 1932, Rowntree appointed a new advertising agency, the London branch of J. Walter Thompson. Thompson undertook extensive market research in order to discover what consumers wanted. As a result of this research, the Black Magic assorted chocolate box was launched in 1934. In January 1935, Rowntree decided to abandon its attempt to compete with the Cadbury Dairy Milk. In May 1935, Rowntree launched the Aero, an aerated milk chocolate. The Chocolate Crisp wafer and chocolate bar (later known as the Kit Kat) was also launched in 1935. In 1937, the Dairy Box of assorted chocolates was launched, using the market research that had been gathered for Black Magic. Chocolate beans were first sold loose in 1938, but were later packaged in a cardboard tube and branded as Smarties. Polo, the distinctive mints with a hole in the centre, were developed in 1939, but their planned introduction was delayed by the onset of war. Harris was made company chairman in 1941. =1945 to 1988= A view of the Nestle production facility in York, taken in 2009 Rowntree entered the continental Europe market in the 1960s, establishing production facilities in Hamburg, Dijon, Elst and Noisiel. After Eights were launched in 1962. In 1969, the Rowntree board rejected a ¬£37 million takeover bid from General Foods. In 1969, Rowntree entered into a long-term agreement with Hershey whereby Hershey would produce Rowntree products under license in the US. Rowntree merged with John Mackintosh and Co in 1969, to become Rowntree Mackintosh. Mackintosh produced Rolo, Munchies, Caramac and Quality Street. The Yorkie and Lion chocolate bars were introduced in 1976. In 1978 the Hershey contract was renegotiated, giving Hershey the rights to the Kit Kat and Rolo brands in the US in perpetuity. Kenneth Dixon was appointed as chairman and chief executive in 1981. Between 1981 and 1987, Rowntree invested nearly ¬£400 million in upgrading its manufacturing facilities and developing high volume, product dedicated equipment for several of the company's leading global brands, including Kit Kat, After Eights and Smarties. Between 1983 and 1987, Rowntree spent nearly ¬£400 million on acquisitions, including Tom's Foods for ¬£138 million (1983), Laura Secord Chocolates for ¬£19 million (1983), Hot Sam Pretzels for ¬£14 million (1986), the Sunmark confectionery business in the US for ¬£156 million (1986) and Gale's honey for ¬£11 million (1986). Between 1982 and 1987, the number of UK staff was reduced from 19,700 to 15,600. In 1987 Rowntree operated 25 factories in nine countries and employed 33,000 people, including close to 16,000 in its eight UK operations. Group turnover was ¬£1.4 billion, with the UK and Ireland accounting for 40 percent of the total. Purchase by Nestle Nestle purchased Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery, re-branded all of its products and took over the Halifax and York headquarters and factories. Today Nestle has slowly began to re- introduce the brand under the name \\"Rowntrees\\". These include Rowntrees Randoms, and Fruit Pastilles. These are the only two non-Nestle branded sweets as no Mackintosh sweets have been re-branded.

Both were not reelected in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election (Melnychuk failed to win a seat in an electoral district in Novomoskovsk with 0.31% of the votes and Lapin was not high enough on the election list (placed 49th) of European Solidarity to get elected).Electoral history of Melnychuk Serhii Petrovych, URK.VOTEElectoral history of Lapin Ihor Oleksandrovych, URK.VOTE On 8 August 2014 Ukraine's Defense Minister Valeriy Heletey stated that the battalion would be reorganised, would receive better equipment and would see more combat missions.

It included a member of the Luhansk Oblast's legislature, a former mayor of Oleksandrivsk, and self-defense activists from the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv. In June 2014, it had around 400 members. The battalion had several subdivisions: * Kholodnyi Yar * Company \\"West\\" * Afgan company * Volyn company * Autorota * Golden company Two Swedish neo-nazis from Svenskarnas parti joined Aidar in 2013 and 2014 and made headlines in Swedish and German media, since one of the nazis was running for a local council in elections, and the same media heavily criticized the nazi mercenaries and, among other things, the Third Reich-inspired motto of the battalion.https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/svenskarna-som-strider-i- ukraina/https://arbetet.se/2014/10/17/svenskar-strider-med-ukrainas- hogerextremister/https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=93&artikel;=5927190 Allegations of human rights violations and war crimes In July 2014, Russia began a criminal investigation of Aidar's commander, Serhiy Melnychuk, for \\"organizing the killing of civilians\\". Its volunteer pilot, Nadiya Savchenko, was captured by pro-Russian separatists near Luhansk, transported to Russia and charged with killing two Russian journalists. On 8 September 2014 Amnesty International claimed that the Battalion had committed war crimes, including abductions, unlawful detention, ill-treatment, theft, extortion, and possible executions. On 24 December 2014, Amnesty International reported that the unit was blocking humanitarian aid from Ukraine reaching the population of the separatist-controlled areas. Over half the population in these areas depend on food aid. According to Amnesty International, the Aidar, Donbass and Dnipro-1 battalions say they are blocking the aid because they \\"believe food and clothing are ending up in the wrong hands and may be sold instead of being given as humanitarian aid\\".Amnesty International, Eastern Ukraine: Humanitarian disaster looms as food aid blocked, 24 December 2014. Denis Krivosheev, acting Director of Europe and Central Asia for Amnesty International, stated that \\"using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime\\". In April 2015, the Ukrainian government appointed Governor of Luhansk Hennadiy Moskal stated that Aidar battalion was \\"terrorizing the region\\" and asked Ukrainian Defense Ministry to rein in its members after a series of thefts, including ambulances and the takeover of a bread factory.

B. Curtis, was an American stage actor, producer, and real estate developer, at one point tried and acquitted of a policeman's murder. Biography Mauritz Bertram Strelinger was born in 1849 as proved by the entry in the Strelinger family Bible. He was born to a Jewish family in Nagy Selmetz, a Hungarian town that is now in Slovakia outside of Ruzomberok. He came to the United States in 1856 as a six year old with his family. He tried to join the Union Army as a drummer boy, but was refused due to extreme youth. He held various jobs in Detroit and then Chicago but was very drawn to the theatre. He eventually got a job at McVickers Theatre in Chicago and began a stage career. He performed in over 200 roles from low comedy to Shakspeare and always received great praise in newspaper reviews. He cut his teeth in San Francisco and Montreal in the 1870s. He was best known for starring as Samuel Plastrick, the lead character in the comic melodrama Sam'l of Posen; or, The Commercial Drummer by George H. Jessop. It was first produced in Georgia in 1879, according to Curtis, and opened in New York on May 16, 1881 after a national tour, having previously been rejected by all New York theatre owners and is credited as introducing the first salesman as hero character. In 1883, Curtis purchased the copyright of the play from Jessop and continued using the Plastrick character into the 1890s.Spears, Timothy B. 100 Years on the Road: The Traveling Salesman in American Culture. Yale University Press, 1995: 136. Though there are many quoted sources for the character of Sam'l after it brought Curtis meteoric fame and fortune, the character was a Jewish \\"drummer\\", or traveling salesman, and Curtis claimed he based his portrayal of him on a real salesman in San Francisco, claiming, \\"He was, perhaps, one of the most comical men that I ever met; and for the life of me I could never refrain from giving imitations of him.\\"Harap, Louise. The Image of the Jew in American Literature: From Early Republic to Mass Immigration. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003 (second edition): 231. Curtis also claimed to have thought of the character while waiting for a train in Texas and others claimed credit as well. The role earned him substantial fame and wealth amounting to US$250,000 ($ today).Duke, Thomas S. Celebrated Criminal Cases of America. San Francisco: The James H. Barry Company, 1910: 31. He was the only private citizen to ever pay to keep the Statue of Liberty lit. Curtis used some of his income to invest in developing real estate in Berkeley, California. He began building the Peralta Park Hotel in 1888; the structure, with its sixty rooms and twenty baths, opened in 1891.Wollenberg, Charles. Berkeley: A City in History. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008: 42. The building was later converted into a Catholic school until its demolition in 1959.Markel, Wendy P. Berkeley. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2009: 94. A year after the building opened, Curtis was arrested for drunken behavior. The arresting officer, Alexander Grant, was shot and killed and, though Curtis denied responsibility, he was indicted for murder. Witnesses claimed he was found at the scene with an abrasion on the wrist indicating he had been struggling with someone, and he was heard saying, \\"My God! I'd give the world to get back to the last four hours!\\"Duke, Thomas S. Celebrated Criminal Cases of America. San Francisco: The James H. Barry Company, 1910: 32. Nevertheless, he was found not guilty in 1893 after four trials, two hung juries, and a procedural dismissal, but both his finances and reputation were ruined.Berresford Mark. That's Got 'Em!: The Life and Music of Wilbur C. Sweatman. University Press of Mississippi, 2010: 21‚Äì22. Curtis revived his Plastrick show. He tempered the stereotypical or crude aspects of the character and, by 1894, one reviewer noted, \\"Nobody, whether Jew or Gentile, could find offence in this amiable, ingenious and kind hearted young Israelite.\\"Harap, Louise. The Image of the Jew in American Literature: From Early Republic to Mass Immigration. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003 (second edition): 233. With this change, the character was less successful overseas, however. Curtis attempted one performance in London on July 4, 1895, and one historian noted the \\"puzzling afternoon\\" was \\"beyond the grasp\\" of the audience, who expected to laugh at the Jewish character rather than with him.Schiff, Ellen. From Stereotype to Metaphor: The Jew in Contemporary Drama. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1982: 29. In 1899, Curtis founded the M. B.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background drilling rig in Texas. Natural gas is a fossil fuel formed when layers of buried plants, gases, and animals are exposed to intense heat and pressure over thousands of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in natural gas. Natural gas is a nonrenewable resource because it cannot be replenished on a human time frame. Natural gas is a hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly includes varying amounts of other higher alkanes and even a lesser percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide. Natural gas is an energy source often used for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. It is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals. Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates. Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found in close proximity to, and with natural gas. Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.US Geological Survey, Organic origins of petroleum US Energy Information Administration Before natural gas can be used as a fuel, it must be processed to remove impurities, including water, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas. The by-products of this processing include ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide (which may be converted into pure sulfur), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium and nitrogen. The world's first industrial extraction of natural gas started at Fredonia, New York, USA in 1825.http://www.aapg.org/explorer/2011/09sep/natgashist0911.cfm By 2009, 66 trillion cubic meters (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 trillion cubic meters of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas.http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2009/WEO2009.pdf Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3.4 trillion cubic meters of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act would direct the United States Department of Energy (DOE) to issue a decision on an application for authorization to export natural gas within 90 days after the later of: (1) the end of the comment period for that decision as set forth in the Federal Register, or (2) the date of enactment of this Act. The bill would grant original and exclusive jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the export facility under an application will be located over any civil action for the review of: (1) a DOE order about the application, or (2) DOE failure to issue a decision on the application. The bill would require the Court, if it finds in a civil action that DOE has failed to issue a decision on an application, to order DOE to issue one within 30 days. The bill would require the Court to set any civil action brought under this Act on the docket, for expedited consideration, as soon as practical after the filing date of the initial pleading. The bill would amend the Natural Gas Act to set, as a condition for approval of any authorization to export liquefied natural gas (LNG), that the DOE Secretary require the applicant to disclose publicly the specific destination or destinations of any such authorized LNG exports. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. Under the Natural Gas Act, the Department of Energy (DOE) regulates imports and exports of natural gas. H.R. 6 would amend that act to specify a deadline for DOE to issue decisions on certain applications for authority to export natural gas. Specifically, H.R. 6 would require DOE to issue a decision on any existing application within 90 days of either the enactment date of H.R. 6 or the close of the comment period pertaining to the application, whichever is later. Based on information from DOE, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 6 would not significantly affect the federal budget. The bill would not materially alter DOE‚Äôs regulatory responsibilities under the Natural Gas Act, and CBO estimates that any change in DOE‚Äôs administrative costs, which are subject to the availability of appropriated funds, would be negligible because of the small number of permits involved. H.R. 6 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 6 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. The bill would impose a private-sector mandate, as defined in UMRA, on entities seeking DOE approval to export natural gas. The Natural Gas Act requires entities seeking to export natural gas to obtain approval from DOE. The bill would require that applicants, as a condition for approval, publicly disclose the countries that would receive the exports. According to DOE, fewer than 100 applications have been approved or are pending for export of natural gas as of March 2014. Because the number of applications for export is small and the cost to disclose destination countries is low, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would fall well below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). Procedural history The Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 6, 2014 by Rep. Cory Gardner (R, CO-4). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power. It was reported (amended) on June 19, 2014 alongside House Report 113-477. Debate and discussion US Natural Gas Production The organization Heritage Action for America argued in favor of the bill, charging that the \\"Department of Energy is refusing to move forward on approximately 24 applications to export liquified natural gas (LNG) to non-FTA countries... onerous delays (that) are detrimental to America's international competitiveness.\\" Some of the current applications have been waiting for a determination from the Department of Energy for over 2 years. Heritage Action said that how a member of Congress voted on this bill would be reflected in the organization's scorecard. The United States Chamber of Commerce supported the bill, arguing that it would \\"eliminate trade barriers limiting and delaying export of natural gas and bringing more supply of this critical energy source to the world, while spurring additional investment in new domestic production.\\" They cited a study by the Department of Energy from December 2012 that concluded \\"the U.S. would experience net economic benefits from increased LNG exports.\\" The trade organization America's Energy Advantage opposed the bill arguing that \\"the unlimited and unchecked export of LNG to nations that have yet to sign free trade agreements with the U.S. will undermine the efforts of U.S. trade negotiators to open closed markets to all American goods and services.\\" The organization argued that allowing greater exports of LNG would increase \\"domestic natural gas and electricity prices for every American.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *List of countries by natural gas exports References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 6 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 6 *GovTrack.us H.R. 6 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 6 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 6 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 6 *House Report 113-477 on H.R. 6 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Natural gas in the United States ","title":"Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act"},{"id":"43135591","text":"Contentverse is a document management system designed by Computhink, Inc. for use in businesses within various industries. Contentverse provides an in-depth filing structure for all files, including documents, images, PDF files, video, audio, and metadata. Documents can be scanned directly into the system or imported from other sources already on the hard drive, network, or cloud. Administrators have the ability to select which users have access to which data, and how they may interact with it. The software was originally released in 1998 as The Paperless Office. The name was changed to ViewWise in 2000 with the fourth major software update. With the launch of a new website built solely for the software in January 2013, the product was rebranded to Contentverse. Product features Contentverse is document management software with features that allow businesses to streamline operations while maintaining accountability through integration document imaging and scanning, security, workflow and email archiving. * Instant search and find allows users to categorize each document when imported according to the fields they choose. With the search function, any file or set of files can then be retrieved from within the database instantly. * Version control creates a new version of a document every time it is saved. Users can go back to previous versions at any time. * Annotations can be made with ease in the system. Highlighting, circling, comments and sticky notes can be saved to each page in a document as a layer which can be toggled. * Redaction tools allow users to block out a region of a page and lock it with a password. This region can only be revealed by a user with the password. * Automated data import features include importing indices and images from a pre-existing text, and importing a native file-format document or image file. * Business process automation is central to the workflow feature in Contentverse, organizing the timeline of a project into a system similar to an assembly line. Each user in the line receives the document in order, adjusts it appropriately, and then it continues down the line until complete. Multiple users may work on a single task together or separate tasks simultaneously. The parameters of the workflow feature are decided by the administrator who creates it. * Regulatory Compliance is offered through a retention module that allows the user to set reminders for any specific documents, enabling compliance. * Web access from desktop, laptop, mobile devices, and tablets. Currently, Contentverse 8.1 is available on Apple computers through the Parallels program. * Microsoft Office compatibility for documents imported into Contentverse in their current state. The program is designed to mimic some of the layout of Microsoft products, giving users a familiar interface. * Audit Trail keeps a record of every action in Contentverse. Every addition, revision, and deletion of a document is tracked, monitored, and logged, even if the changes are executed by the administrator. Data security Contentverse features a number of methods for keeping files secure within and outside of the program. The administrator decides which persons or groups of persons may view files. There is no way for a user to gain access to content which the admin has not exclusively given them permission to see. The files are kept in a storage server, or a number of storage servers, not on the individual interface devices. Administrators may choose which files are stored in which server as well. Additionally, since content accessed through the Contentverse interface is not located on the computer or device itself, any viral or criminal intrusion would not have access to the files themselves. If an invasive force hacks through the server, while files are stored there, they are encrypted in layers.

December 12, 2019\\" On May 20, 2020, the OCC finalized the updates to the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act. On that same day, the OCC and other federal financial regulators published principles for offering small-dollar loans in a responsible manner to meet financial institutions customers‚Äô short-term credit needs. Although community and industry groups agree that the CRA, which has gone without major updates since 1995, is in need of updates, groups from both camps were critical of Otting‚Äôs proposed changes. Community groups such as the National Community Reinvestment Coalition expressed concerns that the changes would lead to reduced lending in low- and middle-income communities. Industry groups like the American Bankers Association and Independent Community Bankers of America worried about the complexity of the updates and the lack of agreement between the OCC and the FDIC and Federal Reserve, all of which share responsibility for enforcing the CRA, on the rule changes. Otting‚Äôs proposed changes would go into effect on January 1, 2023 and would expand the criteria under which banking activities qualify as serving low-income communities. For example, a $500,000 mortgage in an area where the average mortgage size is $1 million could qualify as low- or moderate-income lending. Otting was the CEO of OneWest when the bank sought approval to merge with CIT, a process that was complicated by the bank's history of noncompliance with the CRA. Regulators approved the merger only after both banks pledged to increase their lending in low-income communities. Congresswoman Maxine Waters commented that Otting's efforts to weaken the CRA were likely informed by the challenges the law presented to the merger he presided over at OneWest. In May 2020, it was reported that Otting would resign as Comptroller of the Currency, upon the finalization of the updates to the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act.

He wound up battling hamstring injuries during his time with the club and only played in seven games before he was shut down for good. In those games, he had four hits (including one double and one triple) in 22 at-bats for a .182 average and also stole three bases. =Cincinnati Reds= Peraza with Cincinnati, batting in St. Louis in 2017 On December 16, 2015, Peraza, along with Scott Schebler and Brandon Dixon, were traded to the Cincinnati Reds in a three team trade that sent Frankie Montas, Micah Johnson and Trayce Thompson to the Dodgers and Todd Frazier to the Chicago White Sox. Peraza opened the 2016 season with the Louisville Bats of the International League, playing as a shortstop. He had spent time with the major league team in spring training, but was sent to the minors so he could get regular playing time. Peraza was recalled for the first time in 2016 on May 13, and returned to Louisville five days later. On June 14, Peraza was recalled for the second time, and expected to play a utility role. He was optioned to the minors on August 2, as the Reds wanted him to play regularly at shortstop. On August 21, he returned to the Reds, starting at shortstop in place of the injured Zack Cozart. In 2016 in the majors he batted .324/.352/.411 with 3 home runs. During the 2016‚Äì17 offseason, Brandon Phillips was traded to the Atlanta Braves, a move that was expected to give Peraza a chance to become the Reds' starting second baseman. Just after the All-Star break, Peraza had lost his starting position to Scooter Gennett. He played in 143 games, getting 487 at bats for the Reds, hitting .257 with 5 home runs, 37 RBIs, and 23 stolen bases, while leading the majors in percentage of soft-hit batted balls (26.6%).Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2017 ¬ª Batters ¬ª Batted Ball Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball He had the lowest ISO (Isolated Power) of all MLB players in 2017, at .066.Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2017 ¬ª Batters ¬ª Dashboard  FanGraphs Baseball Peraza was named the Reds' starting shortstop prior to the start of the 2018 season.

It is chaired by Sean Fieler. The organization has campaigned against same-sex marriage, access to abortion, and transgender rights. They have also led efforts opposing the Common Core standard and advocated for monetary reform by suggesting a return to the gold standard.  History  In 2009, the American legal scholar Robert P. George and political strategist Frank Cannon formed APP in order to promote a message of human dignity that they believed was absent in the politics of both parties. By combining high level academic study with effective political strategy, George and Cannon achieved a number of early successes, even with an initially small budget. In 2010, Jeff Bell became the policy director at APP, alongside Cannon providing significant political experience. In 2011, APP served as the lead sponsor of the Palmetto Freedom Forum, a Republican presidential primary debate televised nationally by CNN. They choose the panelists (Sen. Jim DeMint, Rep. Steve King, and Prof. George) in an effort led by APP program director Emmett McGroarty. Following the Republican Party's post-2012 election review, in which the GOP suggested de-emphasizing social issues, APP published a report detailing the importance of social issues to the Republican Party. The report pointed out that Republicans ran almost exclusively on economic issues during the 2012 election to lackluster effect.[9] Four years later, during the 2016 primary, APP created scorecards on a variety of issues and a pledge to sign the First Amendment Defense Act into law that was subsequently signed by the vast majority of Republican candidates (including Donald Trump). APP also led the charge opposing the Common Core in Indiana, the first state to legislatively repeal it. Policy initiatives = Family policy = APP believes that the family stands as the most fundamental unit of society, and supports policy that protects and promotes the welfare of American families. In 2018, APP‚Äôs sister organization released a ‚ÄúContract with American Families‚Äù detailing a number of specific policy proposals the organization supports to help strengthen the family. =Education= The American Principles Project describes its education initiative as an effort to \\"promote policies and actions that protect children and secure their future.\\" It has been critical of the Common Core standards. In 2012, Jane Robbins, Senior Fellow at the American Principles Project, and Emmett McGroarty, Executive Director of APP Education, co-authored a report for the APP and the Pioneer Institute called Controlling Education From The Top: Why Common Core Is Bad For America. Both McGroarty and Robbins have published numerous articles discussing what they perceive as flaws in Common Core, both in its contents and in the way it was enacted. APP staff members have testified before state legislatures, encouraging states to withdraw from the Common Core standards. APP argued that the Republican Party would suffer in the 2016 presidential election if it fielded a pro-Common Core candidate. The American Principles Project launched an effort to expose what it calls a \\"radical new Advanced Placement U.S. History framework,\\" charging that the new AP U.S. History framework teaches a \\"biased, leftist\\" version of the traditionally objective curriculum. =Economics and monetary policy= The American Principles Project has been critical of Federal Reserve System monetary policy and has advocated a return to the gold standard. In November 2014, Steve Lonegan, Director of Monetary Policy at the American Principles Project, sent a public letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen requesting a meeting to discuss how current monetary policy is \\"reducing\\" the standard of living for \\"average working Americans.\\" Jackson Hole Summit 2015 In 2015, American Principles Project funded a conference on economic policy held from August 27‚Äì29, 2015, in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to advocate for hard money monetary policies and an end to government involvement in the money supply. According to associates of hedge fund CEO Robert Mercer interviewed by Bloomberg, Mercer was the main financial backer of the Jackson Hole Summit.

It opened in 1976.  History  Jet Star 2 was designed by famous ride designer Anton Schwarzkopf and was first operated at the 1974 World's Fair in Spokane, WA. After the fair ended, Lagoon purchased Jet Star 2 and relocated it to the park in 1976. Since its relocation to Lagoon, the ride is and has always been a central part of the North Midway section of Lagoon. Jet Star 2 has had many mechanical problems over the years but the system has been overhauled to be more reliable in recent years. Previously, Jet Star 2 had a blinking lighted sign at the top of the lift hill. This sign was removed when the ride was repainted with its current bright red and yellow color scheme in 2006. Before 2005, the colors on Jet Star 2 were reversed with red track and yellow supports. In 2012, Jet Star 2's loading platform was remodeled slightly so that the capacity could increase due to its constant popularity. Jet Star 2 had a large enough impact with the local residents of Spokane, WA during the 1974 World's Fair that local brewery NoLi Brewhouse has named one of their brews \\"Jet Star\\" after the ride.  Experience  The ride starts with a spiral lift. Once at the top of the lift, the vehicle descends a hill, then takes a left turn, another right turn, and another smaller drop. The ride then goes into a series of drops, and turns before hitting the final brake run and stopping at an unloading station. After unloading, the vehicles return to the loading station. Jet Star 2's trains are unique in that they do not have lap bar restraints like a traditional roller coaster. Instead, the restraints are much more like seat belts in a traditional automobile that allow for much more free movement. Riders may have to ride on laps of larger riders if they wish to ride together. Each train has three of these large seats available, allowing for up to six riders at a time. Lagoon's policy is that no single riders may ride on Jet Star 2.

Plot  Oscar Pettinari is a young hick from the suburbs of Rome who attends Cinecitt√† studies, posing as a neighbourhood bully and dreaming of a great acting career, but he is forced to make a living as a stuntman in minor films. Discarded for the umpteenth audition for a large production, a disappointed Oscar, driven by whimsical lawyer Giangiacomo Pigna Corelli, who he met casually, lets himself be convinced to take revenge on the rich producer of the film, cheating him with a false car accident: however, that day the producer's lover, Nancy, a young Italian American actress indicated as a rising star of the star system, was driving the car. The incident, and the possible scandal that could ensue, cost her the dismissal. Abandoned by everyone and stuck in Rome penniless, Nancy finds no other foothold than Oscar, who, being a man with a mild and good- natured soul, offers her hospitality in his home; as the days go by, trying to help each other, a strong friendship is born between the two, and even something deeper. At the same time, Oscar is grappling with the increasingly frequent quirks of his lawyer, who is determined to bring the attempted scam even to court, and in order to win the case, he drags his client in situations to the limit, between unnecessary surgical operations and far-fetched harangue. Everything degenerates when Oscar discovers that Pigna Corelli is nothing more than a mythomaniac, stumbled upon yet another crisis of personality: suddenly realizing the glare, the boy sees his love vanish shortly thereafter when Nancy returns in the United States, determined to resume her career, but now well aware of how fame is not everything. Oscar feels very sorry, but does not give up and, after all, made more mature by the latest events, goes to face another audition with a renewed awareness.

It is situated six miles north-west of Leek. The pond is the subject of an enduring legend that claims that the water is haunted by the ghost of a mermaid.  History  The earliest known record of the lake is from 1686, when Robert Plot wrote about it in his book The Natural History of Staffordshire. According to this text, the pond used to be much larger than its current diameter of . There is some evidence of an artificial trench dug towards its eastern shore which could be the remnants of an attempt to lower the water level. Over the centuries the pond has been the scene of a number of drownings and a murder when, in 1679, a woman pedlar was reportedly dumped in the pool by a local serial killer.  Legend of the mermaid  The local legend of Blakemere Pond tells of a beautiful young woman who rejected the advances of a local man named Joshua Linnet. Unable to accept the rejection, Joshua accused the woman of being a witch and he managed to convince the local townsfolk to drown her in Blakemere Pond. With her final breath, however, the young woman is told to have muttered a curse against Joshua and three days later his body was found by the pool, his face covered with claw marks. The last recorded sighting of the mermaid was in the mid-19th century when a group of locals attempted to drain the lake to see if the pool was indeed bottomless as claimed. Shortly after they began digging at the southern end of the pool (where a drainage ditch can still be seen to this day), it is said that the mermaid appeared from the lake and threatened to flood the nearby towns of Leek and Leekfrith unless they ceased their activities immediately. The source of the story, the folklorist Charlotte S. Burne, records the placename as 'Black Mere'.  Physical dimensions  The pond is near circular with an approximate diameter of . In 1958 a member of the British Sub-Aqua Club established that, at its deepest point, the pool is no more than deep and has a muddy bottom.

It was released on July 18, 1995 on Virgin Records. \\"Dragon Lady\\" was released as a promotional music video and single in June 1995. Lyrics The album's lyrics, written by the band's frontwoman Carla Bozulich, focus on somber topics including, but not limited to, abusive relationships and prostitution. The album's songs also discuss drug use at length, as well as the concept of loss of identity. Music Bozulich, in addition to writing the band's songs, also served as their lead vocalist. On this album, her voice was described by the Los Angeles Times as \\"raw, raspy, [and] Joplin-tinged.\\" CMJ noted that the album's restrained, roots-rock instrumentation is virtually the polar opposite of the music Bozulich made in her previous band, Ethyl Meatplow. Critical reception Lost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home received mixed to positive reviews upon its release, with some critics comparing the band to X due to their shared country-music-influenced sounds. No Depression critic Neil Weiss called it \\"a tough, confusing record, both thematically and musically\\", rooted \\"in the street poetics of the Hollywood underground by way of some West Virginian backwoods on a planet five times more sinister than our own.\\" Spin magazine named Lost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home to their best albums of 1995 list.Best Albums of 1995, Spin Magazine More recently, other musicians have written very favorably of the album; for instance, Lydia Lunch named it one of her 13 favorite albums in 2013. A 2009 article in Magnet called the album a \\"lost classic\\", and said that on the album, \\"the Fibbers' warped alt-country twang haunted the City of Angels like ghosts of California country‚Äôs past, full of grinding violin and poisoned tales of junkies, madness and lost innocence.\\" Nels Cline, who joined the Geraldine Fibbers for the recording of their second album, Butch, called Lost \\"a stone classic\\" in an interview with the Vancouver Sun in 2014. Also in 2014, Spin ranked the album as the 9th best album of 1995, and, like previous reviews of the album, compared its sound to that of X. In 2017, Al Shipley described the album as a \\"country feedback masterpiece\\", adding that it was his \\"...favorite rock album of the 90's.\\" 2017 Vinyl Reissue Jealous Butcher reissued the album May 5, 2017.

His portrait was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence , and is now in the Museum Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid. Background David Lyon senior (1754‚Äì1827) was a successful West Indies merchant. He was descended from William Lyon of Pettanys (1433‚Äì1498) progenitor of the Easter Ogil branch (Burkes L.G. 1906), 3rd son of Patrick Lyon 1st Lord Glamis (1402‚Äì1459). With his wife Isabella Read (1776‚Äì1836) he had ten children, of whom David was the third, born on 8 April 1872. David junior was educated at Harrow (1809). In 1825, aged 31, his portrait was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, then president of the Royal Academy and at the peak of his career. Lawrence was paid for the painting in 1828, which would seem to have cost the high sum of 700 guineas.Garlick, Kenneth: Sir Thomas Lawrence. A Complete Catalogue of the Oil Paintings. Oxford, Phaidon, 1989, p. 232. His father, David Lyon senior, also had his portrait painted by Lawrence, but the whereabouts of this portrait is unknown. Career Lyon Junior was a Tory Member of Parliament for Bere Alston, a so-called rotten borough, controlled by Lord Beverley. He never spoke in Parliament, and, after Bere Alston was disenfranchised by the Reform Act, never returned to office. David Lyon junior joined the family business and had large interests in Jamaica. He was a slave owner, until the abolishment of slavery in 1833, when he was compensated for over two thousand slaves, held on thirteen estates. Two years after retiring from Parliament, he bought an estate near Worthing, Sussex. He pulled down the existing manor house and built Goring Hall, now in use as a hospital. In 1836 he commissioned architect Decimus Burton to redesign St Mary's Church at his expense. He employed Sir Francis Chantry to sculpt a memorial to his mother in 1836 and planted a mile-long avenue of Holm Oaks, known as Ilex Avenue. Around this time he also built Highdown Tower, then known as the Dower House. In 1848, aged 54, he married Blanche Augusta Bury, daughter of Edward Bury and Lady Charlotte Bury, the last being a celebrated novelist in her time. As a dutiful son-in-law he seems to have settled all her debts, and Lady Charlotte lived with the couple, who appeared to be very happy, at least to Benjamin Disraeli. David is portrayed as a \\"celebrated yachter\\" and a \\"very rich\\" man. Lyon becomes High Sheriff of Sussex in 1851. Ten years after their marriage, the couple was involved in an acrimonious and very public quarrel. Blanche took her husband to court to claim \\"restitution of conjugal rights\\".The Morning Post (London, England), Thursday, 22 July 1858; Issue 26384 The case was arranged out of court and \\"Mrs. Lyon went home to her husband\\". But a year later, the same paper carries the announcement by David that she is absenting herself without cause from his house and will not honour any debts she made.The Morning Post (London, England), Wednesday, 8 June 1859; pg. [1]; Issue 26668. 19th Century British Library Newspapers: Part II.

(23294 words). 19th Century British Library Newspapers: Part II. In 1860 David Lyon bought Balintore Castle in Angus, the county of his forebears. Apart from his two country estates, David Lyon owned a London house at 31 South Street, Park Lane. Death The grave of David Lyon, Brompton Cemetery, London Lyon died on 8 April 1872, aged 77, at his winter residence in Nice, without his family, as a delay in telegrams meant his family did not know that he was ill.The Dundee Courier & Argus (Dundee, Scotland), Saturday, 13 April 1872; Issue 5837. 19th Century British Library Newspapers: Part II. He is buried against the north wall of Brompton Cemetery in London towards the north end. His grave sits next to that of British naval officer Admiral Sir Charles Fremantle, namesake of Fremantle, Australia. Lyon left Goring and Balintore to his only surviving brother William, and other property in Sussex to his nephew Arthur James FremantleThe Times, 6 July 1872 At his death, Blanche Lyon ‚Äì quoted as \\"long estranged from her husband\\" ‚Äì was sued by her butcher-cum-moneylender, in which case it is stated that though she had ¬£1,300 a year, she still lived far beyond her means.Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser (Dublin, Ireland), Wednesday, 30 July 1873; Issue N/A. The portrait stayed in the Lyon family until the death of Joy Lyon, who willed it to her friend Elizabeth Carnegy-Arbuthnott.

The town was founded in 1890 around a gold reducing stamp mill. The town was destroyed on June 10, 1891 when the Chambers Lake dam burst and swept down the Poudre Canyon. All that remains of the town today is the chimney from the stamp mill. History In the late 1800s, it was suspected that there was gold in Larimer County and in the hills of the Poudre Canyon and many prospectors moved to the area. John Zimmerman built a 5 stamp gold reducing stamp mill in 1890 to process the ore being brought out of the area. A saloon, general store, hotel, and houses sprouted in the area surrounding the mill. Shortly after the mill's construction, it was determined that the ore bore very little gold, and Zimmerman sold it to pursue other endeavors in the area. In 1891, Zimmerman inspected the dam at Chamber's Lake and had determined it was severely undersized and likely to give way. He had corresponded with the Larimer County Ditch Company, the owner of the lake, and even had hosted the company's Chief Engineer, William Rist, but the dam was not corrected. On the morning of June 10, 1891, the dam gave way. Poudre City, being on the banks of the Poudre River, and directly downstream of Chamber's Lake was in a very vulnerable position. Zimmerman had been out working the fields some 3 1/2 miles upstream that morning and heard the tell tale sounds of water rushing down the canyon. He rode into town to warn the residents to move to higher ground. The flood waters destroyed the entire town and left nothing behind save for the chimney of the stamp mill, which survives to this day. In 1973, the Colorado State Historical Society placed a plaque at the base of the mill.

Although she never contested a Group One race as a two-year-old, Cloonlara was regarded as the best juvenile filly to race in Europe in 1976. She won all three of her races that year by wide margins, culminating in a six length win over colts in the Phoenix Stakes. She missed the rest of the season through injury and failed to reproduce her best form in 1977, when she became increasingly temperamental. Cloonlara made a highly-promising start to her breeding career before dying at the age of seven in 1981. Background Cloonlara was a bay filly bred in Kentucky by the Irish-based Lyonstown Stud. She was sired by Sir Ivor, an American-bred colt whose wins included The Derby and Washington, D.C. International in 1968. At stud he was best known as an exceptional sire of broodmares but also sired many good winners over a wide variety of distances and surfaces with his progeny including Ivanjica, Bates Motel, Sir Tristram and French Holly. Cloonlara's dam Fish Bar produced several other winners including the leading miler Kings Lake. Fish Bar was a granddaughter of the 1000 Guineas and St Leger Stakes winner Herringbone, whose other descendants included Moon Madness, Celtic Swing and Michelozzo. Racing in the colours of John Mulcahy, Cloonlara was sent to race in Ireland where she was trained by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. She was named after a village in County Clare. Racing career =1976: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut Cloonlara contested the Hurry-On Stakes over five furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse and won by five lengths from Success At Last and seven others. Only two horses appeared to oppose the filly when she was moved up in distance for the Probationers Stakes over six and a half furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse. Starting at odds of 1/10 she won by five lengths, emulating her sire, Sir Ivor, who won the same race in 1967. Cloonlara was then dropped back in distance, and moved up in class for the Group Two Phoenix Stakes over five furlongs on firm ground at Phoenix Park. She was made second favourite behind the colt Godswalk who had won the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot by four lengths. Cloonlara broke quickly, established a clear advantage, and was never seriously challenged, winning by six lengths from Godswalk with Ring Leader (who had won his previous race by ten lengths) in third place. The filly sustained an injury in the race and finished lame. Despite hopes that she might return for the Cheveley Park Stakes she did not race again in 1976. =1977: three-year-old season= On her debut as a three-year-old in April 1977, Cloonlara was sent to England for the 1000 Guineas Trial at Ascot Racecourse where the ground was so soft that the starting stalls could not be used and the race was started by flag. When the flag fell for the first time, Cloonlara, ridden by Lester Piggott, started well, but the runners were recalled after a false start was declared. On the second start, Cloonlara was standing side-on as the flag fell, lost approximately twenty yards and never recovered, finishing unplaced behind the French filly Sanedtki. The race reportedly provoked a \\"sharp exchange\\" between Piggott and the starter Dick Smalley. Despite her unfortunate experience at Ascot, Cloonlara was made 6/4 favourite for the 165th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. She took the lead from the start but was strongly challenged by the 16/1 outsider Mrs McArdy two furlongs from the finish. When Piggott resorted to the whip, the filly's only response was to swish her tail in a \\"querulous\\" manner, and she finished the race in fourth place behind Mrs McArdy, Freeze The Secret and Sanedtki. Attempts to return the filly to sprint distances in the Cork and Orrery Stakes at Royal Ascot in June proved unsuccessful as she threw Piggott off in the preliminaries and then refused to enter the starting stalls. In the Prix de la Porte Maillot over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse later that month, she was more co- operative, consenting to start the race without giving any trouble. Starting at odds of 11/1 she appeared to have every chance in the straight but finished fourth of the eleven runners, two and three-quarter lengths behind the winner Polyponder. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1976: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the Irish Free Handicap Cloonlara was rated the best two-year- old of either sex, seven pounds superior to Godswalk, ten ahead of The Minstrel and thirteen ahead of Nebbiolo. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 130, making her the best two-year-old filly of the season, one pound behind their best two-year-old colt Blushing Groom and level with their highest-rated British juvenile J O Tobin. The veteran Irish trainer Paddy Prendergast, reportedly regarded her as the best filly seen in Ireland for more than thirty years. In 1977, Cloonlara was given a rating of 117 by Timeform, sixteen pounds below their top-rated three-year-old filly Dunfermline. In the inaugural International Classification for three-year-olds she was given a rating of 80, ten pounds below the top fillies Dunfermline and Madelia. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cloonlara the twenty- first best British or Irish-trained two-year-old filly of the 20th century. Breeding record Cloonlara was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She produced only three foals, all of whom won races: *Chivalry (bay colt, foaled in 1979, sired by Nijinsky), won one race in Ireland and one race in the United States *Glenstal (bay colt, 1980, by Northern Dancer), won three of his five races including the National Stakes and the Prix Daphnis and sired the 1000 Guineas winner Las Meninas. *Atlantic Salmon (brown gelding, 1981, by Lyphard), won two races in Ireland Cloonlara was in foal to Northern Dancer, when she was killed by lightning in 1981.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Travelers who undergo the pre-clearance procedures at one of these facilities in a foreign airport do not have to go through U.S. customs upon their arrival in the United States. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Preclearance Authorization Act of 2014 would authorize the United States Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish preclearance facilities, conduct preclearance operations, or provide customs services outside of the United States of America to prevent terrorists, terrorist instruments, and other national security threats from gaining access to the United States. The bill would declare such requirements shall not apply to any preclearance facility that was in operation outside of the United States before enactment of this Act. The bill would declare that any preclearance facility located, preclearance operations conducted, or customs services provided at Abu Dhabi International Airport, Al Maktoum International Airport, Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, or Doha International Airport in Qatar shall not be considered to have been in operation, conducted, or provided before enactment of this Act. Prohibits such facility, operations, or services from being established, conducted, or provided at any of such airports on or after such enactment. The bill would require the Secretary, not later than 180 days before entering into any agreement to establish a preclearance facility, conduct preclearance operations, or provide customs services outside of the United States, to: (1) notify Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) of the intent to establish such facility, conduct such operations, or provide such services; as well as (2) assess any impacts on passengers traveling to the United States, or economic or security impacts on the United States. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 11, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3488 would authorize Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the United States Department of Homeland Security to establish preclearance (inspection) stations in foreign countries. CBP currently operates preclearance facilities in about a dozen locations, mostly in Canada. The bill would require the agency to notify the Congress before establishing preclearance stations in countries that currently have none. H.R. 3488 also would specify policies and requirements to ensure that aviation security screening performed at foreign airports engaged in preclearance operations meet U.S. standards. CBP anticipates opening new preclearance stations over the next several years and can do so under current law, so we estimate that implementing the bill would not significantly affect agency spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also expects that implementing the bill‚Äôs requirements related to aviation security would not significantly affect federal costs. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as- you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3488 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Preclearance Authorization Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 14, 2013 by Rep. Patrick Meehan (R, PA-7). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security, the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security. On July 3, 2014, the bill was reported (amended) by the Committee on Homeland Security alongside House Report 113-511 part 1. The House was scheduled to vote on the bill on July 8, 2014, under a suspension of the rules. Debate and discussion Rep. Pat Meehan, who introduced the bill, indicated that the goal of the bill is to prevent the Customs Bureau from opening a pre-clearance facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport in the United Arab Emirates because one airline there currently flies to the United States. That airline is Etihad, a state-run airline, that supporters of the bill wish to avoid giving an unfair competitive advantage that might result from travelers flying on Etihad through that airport in order to take advantage of the chance to be pre- cleared, and opportunity passengers on other airlines would not have. According to the American Association of Airport Executives, the bill is supported by the U.S. airline industry. The Air Line Pilots Association lobbied in favor of the bill.

He is known as a Swedenborgian, who was active in later life publishing his views. Life Born in or about 1797, the fifth son of Stephen Clissold (1764‚Äì1834) of Stonehouse, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, he had Stephen Clissold the writer as an elder brother. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 6 December 1814, the same day as his elder brother Henry. He took the ordinary B.A. degree on 19 November 1818, proceeding M.A. on 13 June 1821. In 1821 Clissold was ordained deacon and in 1823 admitted to priest's orders by Thomas Burgess, Bishop of Salisbury. He held for some time the curacies of St Martin- in-the-Fields and St Mary, Stoke Newington. Clissold became a follower of Emanuel Swedenborg and withdrew from the Anglican ministry about 1840, but remained nominally connected with the Church of England to the end of his life. He continued to reside in Stoke Newington. He died on 30 October 1882 at his country house, 4 Broadwater Down, Tunbridge Wells, in his 86th year. Swedenborgian The Swedenborg Association was started in 1845 for the publication of Swedenborg's scientific works, and merged after its task had been larger accomplished, with the larger Swedenborg Society. Clissold was chosen as President of the Association. In 1838 he joined the Swedenborg Society as a life member, and in the same year he was placed on the committee. In 1840 he chaired the annual meeting. In 1854 he purchased for the use of the society seventy years' lease of 36 Bloomsbury Street, London, which later became a distribution centre for \\"New Church\\" literature. During the troubled time through which the Swedenborg Society passed in 1859‚Äì1860, Clissold supported it financially. He left it ¬£4,000 in his will. Works Clissold translated and printed at his own expense Swedenborg's Principia Rerum Naturalium, 2 vols., London, 1845‚Äì1846, and ≈íconomia Regni Animalis (edited by J. J. Garth Wilkinson), 2 vols., London, 1846, both of which he gave to the Swedenborg Association. He was the author of the following: *The Practical Nature of the Doctrines and alleged Revelations contained in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg ‚Ä¶ in a Letter to the Archbishop of Dublin (R.

Clissold), London, 1879 Clissold also published a sermon preached on the death of the Rev. George Gaskin, London, 1829. In 1870 he busied himself with promoting the publication of the Documents concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg 2 vols. 1875‚Äì1877, based on originals collected, translated, and annotated by Johann Friedrich Immanuel Tafel. During the last two years of his life he assisted similarly in the publication of Swedenborg's posthumous work on The Brain, 1882, part of the Regnum Animale perlustratum. Family Clissold married Elizabeth Crawshay, daughter of William Crawshay, some time after the latter's death in 1834. They had no children. On the marriage, the Newington Park House estate passed to Clissold. It was renamed Clissold Park and the house Clissold House.

The project's aim is that the E1000 will be the fastest single-engine civil aircraft at its time of introduction. Design A development of the kit-built Epic LT, the E1000 aircraft features a cantilever low-wing, a 6.5 psi pressurized cabin with an airstair door just ahead of the rear seats, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6-67A turboprop aircraft engine, de- rated to engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is predominantly made from carbon fiber and its span wing mounts flaps and winglets. The E1000 will have deicing boots and a heated windshield for certification in known icing conditions. The aircraft has a goal empty weight of and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of and a full-fuel payload of , allowing the fuel tanks and seats to all be filled. Preliminary performance data shows a 325kt (600 km/h) maximum airspeed, 1,650nmi (3,050 km) range, 45USgal/h fuel consumption at cruise altitude, and a 34,000 ft operating ceiling. Development The E1000 was developed from the pictured Epic LT kit plane In 2013, the E1000 was launched, intended to be a type certificated, upgraded Epic LT kit plane. In 2014, Epic stopped selling the kit plane, the 54th and final one was delivered in the second quarter of 2019. In February 2014 Epic had ten orders for the type and initial deliveries were targeted for the second half of 2015. In early 2014 the design was forecast for its first flight in June 2015, with certification then expected later in 2015. By October 2014, it had 60 orders and Epic targeted 50 sales per year. In October 2014 the manufacturer introduced the interior design which includes features such as club seating, adjustable tray tables in the cabin sidewalls, pockets large enough to stow a tablet computer, USB power outlets, cup holders and light-emitting diode light switches. The Garmin G1000 navigation system will include a synthetic vision system. It includes SPD-Smart Electronically Dimmable Window (EDW) Systems. In 2015, certification slipped to 2016. and the company forecast commencing deliveries in 2016, as well. The first flight occurred on 19 December 2015 and Epic reported \\"more than\\" 60 orders. In May 2016 the first conforming prototype was under construction and certification was then expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, with customer deliveries forecast for early 2017. In October 2017 Epic reported 76 outstanding orders. The first prototype had accumulated 400 hours, while the production-conforming second prototype was nearing first flight. Russian-owned Epic was hoping at that time to complete type certification in 2018. The second prototype flew in January 2018. In 2018 the company hoped to convert its 85 reservations into firm orders and planned a production capacity of 50 aircraft per year. By 2018 the company had 250 employees, enough funds for certification and the initial production years. Eight to 12 aircraft are planned to be delivered in 2019, 24 in 2020, 36 in 2021 and 50 thereafter, with an ultimate market forecast of 80 to 90 units per year. The fuselage was tested to 18 psi, nearly three times its normal 6.6 psi pressurization, while the wing was tested to , deflecting to . By September 2018, after 700 hours of flight tests, Epic Aircraft maintained it would achieve its year-end type certification goal, with production certification following six months later. By November 2018, the two prototypes had accumulated 800 hours and Epic expected US type inspection authorization in December for an early 2019 type certification and deliveries soon after, a two-year delay from earlier forecasts. The final Epic LT kit plane was completed in June 2019. In November 2019, the design was FAA type certificated after a seven-year development effort, with the two prototypes completing more than 1,000 hours of flight testing. Initial customer deliveries against the existing 80 aircraft on order were planned before the end of 2019. After delays imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, in July 2020 the company received its FAA production certificate for the aircraft. The first aircraft was delivered in February 2020 before being leased back to Epic to support engineering projects, and the second aircraft was delivered in May. Operational history In July 2020 the E1000 was named as the winner of Flying magazine's 2020 Innovation Award. Flying‚Äôs Editor-in-Chief Julie Boatman, noted the aircraft's deliveries starting during the COVID-19 pandemic, \\"we‚Äôre really pleased to be in a position to award the 2020 Innovation Award to Epic Aircraft for the phenomenal job that you‚Äôve done, not just bringing the aircraft to certification over a couple of decades, but also in the midst of everything that we‚Äôve been going through over the last 4 months now, to continue pushing forward, to get those first deliveries out the door, and into the hands of some extremely happy pilots\\".

It can be found in shallow reefs on the reef tops, walls and slopes to depths of 30 m. Description Colonies of Acropora florida consist of thick upright, and sometimes horizontal, branches growing from a sprawling or encrusting base. There are side branches and small branchlets which resemble knobs. The corallites are evenly spread. The colour of this coral varies, and may be pinkish-brown or some shade of green. Biology Acropora florida is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues. These photosynthetic organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps. Status This coral is a common species and no species-specific threats have been identified. The main threats faced by corals in general are related to climate change and the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats; increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being \\"near threatened\\".

He ruled around 785 BC. Most of the information about him comes from his basalt stele, known as the Stele of Zakkur. History Not so much is known about Zakkur. He is first mentioned in Assyrian sources in 808 BC, at the time of Adad-nirari III. Adad-nirari ordered his commander Shamshi-ilu to mediate the border dispute between Zakkur and Atarshumki I of Arpad.Edward Lipi≈Ñski, On the Skirts of Canaan in the Iron Age: Historical and Topographical Researches.

Millard, The Homeland of Zakkur, Semitica 39 [M. Sznycer Volume] (1990): 47-52. Zakkur is believed to have founded the Aramean dynasty at the city of Hamath (now known as Hama).Scott B. Noegel, The Zakkur Inscription. In: Mark W. Chavalas, ed. The Ancient Near East: Historical Sources in Translation. London: Blackwell (2006), 307-311 Some scholars consider him as an usurper, because, previously, Hamath was ruled by the kings with Luwian or neo-Hittite names. Luhuti, over which Zakkur came to rule, is known primarily from Assyrian inscriptions. Nevertheless, these inscriptions describe Luhuti as a country with many cities and troops. The capital of Luhuti was the city of Hazrik (modern Tell Afis; it was known as Hatarikka for the Assyrians), located 45 kilometers south of Aleppo. This is where the Zakkur Stele was found. Luhuti was incorporated into Hamath around 796 BC; it formed the northern province of the kingdom. =Events described in the Stele= Zakkur was besieged in Tell Afis by a coalition of Aramean kings incited by Ben-Hadad III of Aram-Damascus, and led by the king of Bit Agusi. Zakkur survived the siege and commemorated the event by commissioning the Stele of Zakkur. See also *Aram (biblical region) References Bibliography *Scott B. Noegel, The Zakkur Inscription.

Weighing 32 tons and measuring , the sculpture is made from red Verona marble and represents a woman's vulva. It cost ‚Ç¨120,000 and was originally intended to have a pool of water at its base, but budgetary constraints prevented this element of the design from being constructed. Overview The sculpture's name is from the native Peruvian Quechuan language. According to de la Jara, the word chac√°n means \\"place where the action of water has tunneled through a large rock or a mountain\\", or alternatively \\"lovemaking\\". Pi is both a Greek character and a mathematical symbol, œÄ, that looks similar to a door or a vulva. It is placed at the end of the Weg der K√ºnste (Street of the Arts) facing the entrances of the university's Anatomy, Microbiology and Virology buildings. This location, in a place dedicated to the study and healing of the human body, inspired the artist to devise a way \\"to celebrate the body.\\" De la Jara comments: De la Jara says that he intended the work to be tactile and able to be appreciated even by the blind, through the use of different textures and forms: \\"The principal part of the work isn't outside.\\" He describes it as \\"participatory art\\" and suggests that \\"it should be entered.\\" Incident On 20 June 2014, the sculpture attracted widespread international media attention when an unnamed American exchange student got trapped inside it, reportedly after climbing into it as part of a dare. He was said to have \\"tried to pose for an unusual photo\\" but found that he could not climb out of it. When the T√ºbingen police received an emergency call to tell them that \\"a person is trapped inside a stone vulva\\", 5 fire engines and 22 firefighters were sent to rescue the student from the sculpture. According to the local fire brigade, \\"We were able to pull the victim out with our bare hands after about 30 minutes ... a forceps delivery was not necessary.\\" T√ºbingen's mayor later told the media that he could not imagine how the incident had happened \\"even when considering the most extreme adolescent fantasies. To reward such a masterly achievement with the use of 22 firefighters almost pains my soul.\\" A witness who took photographs of the student stuck in the sculpture and posted them on Imgur commented, \\"The fire department was not really amused, and he was really embarrassed.\\" Neither the sculpture nor the student was harmed in the incident. The sculpture's artist, Fernando de la Jara, told New York magazine that he was amused by the incident and attributed it to \\"a lack of coordination ... or maybe it was a lack of sensibility\\" on the part of the student. He commented that \\"instead of jumping in, if he had gone in carefully, he wouldn't have had a problem.\\" References Category:2001 sculptures Category:Culture of Baden-W√ºrttemberg Category:Marble sculptures in Germany Category:Outdoor sculptures in Germany Category:Yonic symbols ","title":"Pi-Chac√°n"},{"id":"43136515","text":"Museo Eduardo Carrillo is the only Artist Endowed Foundation in the United States devoted to the work of a Mexican-American artist.

They were composed between 1928 and 1931 and were Schoenberg's last works for solo piano.  Composition  Schoenberg's Piano Pieces were just some of the smaller compositions that he made after finishing Von heute auf morgen and Moses und Aron. He started composing the first movement, Op. 33a, when the director of Universal Edition contacted him to publish the first piece in Op. 11 in an anthology of piano compositions. Schoenberg then decided to write a new piece on December 25, 1928, and finished it on April 25, 1929. The composition of the second movement, however, took only three days, from October 8 to 10, 1931, while he was staying in Barcelona. They were composed separately, but it is still unknown if Schoenberg had conceived them to be a full-length composition in itself. Both movements were also premiered separately. The first movement was published by Universal Edition in July, 1929, and premiered in Berlin, on January 30, 1931, by Else C. Klaus. The second movement was published by The New Music Society of California Publisher, in April, 1932, and premiered in San Francisco's New Music Society on January 11, 1934, by Douglas Thompson. Since then, it has also been published by Belmont Music Publishers and by Schott Music.  Analysis  The two movements of this composition show the development of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, from its initial conception until its culmination in 1936. It takes approximately five minutes to perform both movements, and neither movement has a title. In some recordings, the movements are titled according to their tempo markings: * I. M√§ssig * II. M√§ssig langsam Both movements follow the principles of the twelve-tone technique, according to which a row of twelve tones is selected in order to construct the composition. The row of Op. 33a is 0 7 2 1 11 8 3 5 9 10 4 6. In order to compose the piece, Schoenberg uses inverted and retrograde versions of the row in various forms. The first movement starts with six chords, which show the row used in the piece.  Arrangements  Takatoshi Naitoh arranged this composition for computer and synthesizer in 1991. It was recorded at the Polydor KK Studio in Tokyo, in June, 1991, and was released by Deutsche Grammophon in Japan.

In the United States, there is no consensus definition of what level of gains constitutes a wave election. Terminology Political analyst Charlie Cook describes wave elections as the result of a \\"overarching, nationwide dynamic,\\" such as a high or low Presidential approval rating, economic conditions, and scandals. Cook contrasts wave elections with \\"micro- elections\\" in which neither party makes significant gains, and candidates, local issues, and other factors not strictly related to party alignment have a stronger role than in wave elections. Although several wave elections may occur in a row, wave elections are usually considered to be the exception rather than the norm. A pick-up of 20 seats in the United States House of Representatives has been used as a cut-off point by analysts such as Stuart Rothenberg. However, political scientist Dan Hopkins has argued that the term has little utility in understanding elections and that there is no clear cut- off point between a wave election and other elections. Congressional incumbents in the United States enjoy an electoral advantage over challengers, but a wave election often boosts challengers, resulting in many more incumbents losing than usual during wave elections. A wave election can put into play seats that would otherwise be considered safe for the party holding the seat, and help even flawed challengers defeat incumbents. Since at least 1954, wave elections have always benefited one party at the expense of the other, but the term has also been used to describe a hypothetical scenario in which numerous incumbents from both parties lose their seats. The first election after redistricting is often a wave election, since many incumbents are less firmly rooted in their districts following redistricting, and many other incumbents retire or suffer primary defeats. A wave election may also be concurrent with a landslide election, a term which usually refers to decisive victories in Presidential contests. Many wave elections occur during midterm elections, with the party out of power picking up seats. A common pattern involves a party with a victorious Presidential candidate benefiting from a wave election, followed by the opposing party winning a wave election in the next midterm election.

The site was located just outside the original city in an area that was considered useless swampy land. The station was also used by the New Orleans Terminal Company. The railroad vacated the building in 1975 and it sat empty for many years. The Valentino Family purchased the building and began renovation in 2004.

It consists of post-synaptic granule cell dendrites and pre-synaptic Golgi cell axon terminals surrounding the pre- synaptic terminals of mossy fibers. Function The cerebellar glomeruli are the first \\"processing station\\" for afferent nerve fibers entering the cerebellum. Input comes from the mossy fibers, which terminate there and synapse with the Golgi and granule cell fibers. The Golgi cells regulate the glomeruli with inhibitory signals, while information is passed on to the granule and Golgi cells from the mossy fiber. Structure A cerebellar glomerulus is about 2.5 um in diameter, and is wrapped by glial sheathing. Glomeruli are centered on the large axonal terminals of glutamatergic afferent mossy fibers. Each terminal comes into contact with dendrites from 50‚Äì60 different granule cells. The granule cells themselves each have a single or multiple dendrites, and each participates in a different glomerulus. Glomeruli also contain the GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses of Golgi cells onto granule cells, and the glutamatergic (excitatory) synapses from mossy fibers onto Golgi cells. Each glomerulus contains approximately 50 granule cell dendrites, 210 total dendritic digits and 230 synaptic junctions. Velate astrocytes Velate astrocytes are glia that sheath the glomeruli. They are protoplasmic astrocytes with extremely thin veil-like processes that spread out and overlap each other. Researchers Sanford Palay and Victoria Chan-Palay noted that the sheath does not penetrate into the deeper part of the glomeruli or come into contact with the mossy fiber. Instead it forms a capsule, through which the neural processes of the granule and Golgi cells penetrate. The purpose of the glial sheath is still unknown, though multiple functions have been proposed, including structural support, electrophysiological insulation, and chemical equilibrium maintenance in the interstitial fluid, while creating a chemical barrier to the further outgrowth of granule and Golgi cell fibers. Research conducted by David Eagleman suggests that the glial sheath limits the supply of extracellular calcium to regulate signaling.Olivier, D. E. et al.

He was appointed Governor-General in 1995 and was sworn in on 1 January 1996. While in office, he was the world's oldest serving de facto head of state. His retirement was announced on 25 December 2012 and became effective on 1 January 2013. Life and career Sebastian was the son of Joseph Matthew Sebastian, who was a Member of the Legislative and Executive Councils of Saint Christopher-Nevis- Anguilla until his death in 1944, and Inez Veronica Sebastian (n√©e Hodge). He studied at Mount Allison University, New Brunswick, where he obtained a BSc degree. He entered Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he studied medicine and graduated, in 1958, with a MDCM degree to become a surgeon. He has served in St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla as pupil teacher, learner/dispenser, chemist and druggist, laboratory technician, senior dispenser, medical superintendent and obstetrician‚Äìgynaecologist. He was Chief Medical Officer of St. Kitts and Nevis from 1980 to 1983. From 1962 to 1966, he pursued training at the Dundee Royal Infirmary, Scotland in obstetrics and gynaecology. Sebastian was a rear gunner during World War II in the Royal Canadian Air Force, Captain (Surgeon) in the St. Kitts-Nevis Defence Force, local physician to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales (Prince Charles), when His Highness visited St. Kitts in 1973 (the Prince of Wales visited the island to open the newly restored Prince of Wales Bastion, 1 June). In addition, he was ADC to the Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla Premier, Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw, when Bradshaw went to Buckingham Palace on the occasion of Her Majesty's 25th year on the Throne. Sebastian received the Auxiliary Forces (Officer's) Efficiency Decoration (ED), and was made an Officer of Order of the British Empire (OBE) (civil division) from Queen Elizabeth II in 1969.

In essence, it gives the promoter a form of territorial exclusivity, ensuring that the performer does not book concerts with competing promoters and venues in nearby areas, which can undermine ticket sales for their main event. Critics in favor of radius clauses have agreed with their intent to protect the investments of organizers into the production and promotion of music events, and that they are a worthwhile trade-off for acts wanting to obtain the expanded exposure that a festival performance can provide. Others have criticized the concept, arguing that they effectively discourage major acts from performing in smaller cities, and are influenced by a profit-oriented mentality in the live events industry. In 2010, the state of Illinois also launched an antitrust investigation into the use of radius clauses by Lollapalooza.  Effects  Radius clauses contractually ensure that a particular act does not hold events at competing venues or festivals within a certain distance of a city in which they are scheduled to perform, for a length of time prior to and/or after the performance. For example, a band booked to perform at a venue in San Francisco may be barred from performing in cities within a radius of San Francisco, for 60 days, before and after the concert. These clauses intend to maximize ticket sales; as an act cannot also perform concerts in smaller, nearby markets, fans in these markets are forced to instead buy tickets for the act in the major market. The use of radius clauses has been considered controversial by some venue owners‚Äîespecially those who own small-market venues in proximity to larger markets, or those in markets with a large number of venues‚Äîas they affect their ability to book major acts. In the city of Chicago, radius clauses imposed by the city's major music festival Lollapalooza can make it difficult for venues and block parties around the city to book major acts during the lucrative summer months. Similar effects are faced by the Greater Los Angeles Area in the lead-up to the Coachella Festival, although they are not as pronounced as those of Lollapalooza because their radius clauses fall during the winter months. Dangerbird Records founder Jeff Castelaz argued that such clauses were a \\"reality\\" in the music business, since music festival promoters have to protect their investments in securing acts and promoting their event. On the other hand, while noting that festival appearances can be a significant milestone for an up-and-coming act rather than exclusively playing clubs, talent agency head Tom Windish felt that there was a mentality in the live events industry where \\"if you don't have 75,000 people at your event, it's a failure.\\"  Notable users  = Coachella = The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival uses radius clauses which, as of 2012, could prevent acts from performing in Los Angeles, the Inland Empire, or San Diego for up to three months before and after the festival. The festival has allowed some of its acts to make appearances in the region prior to the festival, but only at events and venues owned or controlled by festival owner Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG)‚Äîsuch as Jay-Z at Staples Center in 2010. That year also marked the first time Coachella had ever sold out in advance. In 2018, the organizers of the Portland, Oregon Soul'd Out Music Festival filed an antitrust lawsuit against AEG, alleging that Coachella had enforced radius clauses much stricter than previously reported. In its original complaint, the organizers stated that the restrictions had extended to the entirety of California, as well as Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. In an amended complaint, the organizers identified that Coachella performers are forbidden from: * During a period that starts on the December 15 prior to Coachella and ends on the following May 1. ** Playing any festival in North America ** Playing any \\"hard ticket\\" concerts in Southern California * Publicizing any tour stops in California, Arizona, Oregon, or Washington until after the Coachella lineup is announced. * Publicizing any performances at competing festivals in California, its bordering states, and Washington, or a headlining concert in Southern California, until May 8. * Publicizing any performances at competing festivals in the remainder of the United States (except for the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, South by Southwest, and Ultra Music Festival) until after the Coachella lineup is announced. With respect to Nevada, they can publicize appearances at Las Vegas casinos, or tour stops in other parts of Nevada, but cannot publicize Las Vegas festival appearances. = Other events = In April 2010, it was reported that Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan had launched an antitrust investigation into the Lollapalooza festival's use of radius clauses. It was alleged that the festival had imposed radius clauses on performers that were so strict, that some acts were barred from performing within of Chicago--including cities as far as Detroit, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee--for as long as six months prior to, and three months after Lollapalooza. In June 2014, the Toronto festival NXNE announced that it would drop a 45-day radius clause it had implemented for its 2014 edition, following protests by fans and artists (including a Change.org petition with over 3000 signatures), with a particular emphasis on its effects on emerging artists. NXNE 2014 marked the first time that it had been held just weeks after Canadian Music Week (CMW)--which had moved to May from its traditional March date; the clause had been implemented primarily to prevent NXNE acts from performing at CMW. In 2017, South By Southwest (SXSW) was the subject of criticism for several controversial clauses in its performance contracts, including one warning that international performers entering the United States under the Visa Waiver Program to perform at SXSW would face threats of deportation and passport revocation if they performed outside of their \\"official\\" events (a large number of parties unaffiliated with SXSW are held in Austin alongside the official festival). Managing director Roland Swenson stated that this clause was based on U.S. immigration law; performing in the country requires a work visa, but SXSW performers have typically qualified under the Visa Waiver Program because it classifies itself as an \\"industry showcase\\". Those who do perform under this clause are legally forbidden from performing any shows beyond the specific showcase they have been granted permission for. Some critics initially interpreted this statement as being a traditional radius clause.

Regarded as a living saint by her followers, she fought a bitter battle over the succession of her father's barakah and Zawiya with her cousin Sa'id ibn Lakhdar which involved the French colonial administration. She would later build a friendship with Isabelle Eberhardt. Early life Lalla Zaynab was born in 1850, a daughter of Muhammad bin Abi al-Qasim, a Rahmaniyya leader of the al-Hamil region in Algeria. She was a Sufi Muslim, and a member of a family who claimed to be direct descendant of Muhammad. Prior to succeeding her father as the leader of the al-Hamil, Zaynab faced great societal and political opposition. Zaynab lived during a time where she was subjected to a dual social order which worked to aid her suppression. Society would be organized according to class, gender and racial distinctions. This structure would be applied through the French colonial authorities, who deemed native Algerians uncivilized and unequal. The structure would again be applied by the Algerian society. In the Algerian Muslim community, Zaynab was rendered extraordinary due to her saintliness, piety, Sharifian descent and the miracles attributed to her by the religious authorities within the community. However, barely any Arabic literature is written about her as she lived in her father's shadow prior to 1897. This is a result of her age, prestige, and amount of respect she commanded. Such shadowing is a common occurrence for subordinates to Sufi superiors, and was not a restraint on gender enforced on her by the Algerian community who highly regarded her. The French colonial administration refused to recognize her spiritual authority on two bases. Firstly, they did not hold the same beliefs as the Algerian Muslims and never understood the importance the Algerian Muslims attributed to Zaynab. Secondly, the French authorities refused to accept the rule of a woman, as women were seen to be the weaker sex. Hence, Zaynab's rise was the accompanied by an increase in meddling of the affairs of succession by the French colonial administration. Despite her many suitors, Zaynab maintained a vow of celibacy which would allow her to move freely around the community while harnessing and exerting her spiritual authority and social empowerment. Lalla enjoyed a close relationship to her father, the Shaykh. She spent most of her time in the oasis and grew up the in the harim (the private residence attached to the Shaykh's house that housed around 40 women). Lalla would be personally educated by her father, which allowed her to accumulate great prestige among his followers due to her formidable knowledge. Sidi Muhammad also educated her on the matters of his rule and she would later help in the keeping of the accounts and properties of the Rahmaniyya center. Lalla remained informed about the political and financial decisions taken by her father, and she acted as a confidant regarding these matters. It was claimed that the Shaykh had ‚Äútrained her from childhood to fill the role that awaited her,‚Äù however this can only be inferred, as no official written will of his succession was left, and the Shaykh had no living sons. However, two months prior to her father's death in 1897, he had written a letter to Bu Sa‚Äôada, under intense pressure from the French colonial authorities, to designate Zaynab's cousin, Muhammad b al Hajj Muhammad, as the rightful successor. Only the French knew of this document and Zaynab remained uninformed on all the matters of succession. Another document would be referred to during Zaynab's fight to claim her father's place. In 1877, when Sidi Muhammad suffered a heart attack, he drew up a will regarding the distribution of his inheritance upon his death. Although it was customary for the daughters to receive half of what the sons did, he specified for Lalla Zaynab, his ‚Äòfavorite daughter,‚Äô to receive the as much as any male heir (although he had none at this time). Religious and Political life = Battle to Succession = The Shaykh suffered another heart attack in 1897 which caused his death. This led to a battle of succession between Lalla Zaynab and her cousin, Muhammad b al Hajj Muhammad. Rallying the armies of Bu Sa‚Äôad, Muhammad b al Hajj Muhammad arrived at the door of Zaynab's Zawiya to stake his claim. However, Zaynab refused to acknowledge her cousins spiritual and moral authority on two grounds. First, Muhammad was regarded as impious and worldly, which made him unqualified for the duties of the position and undeserving to replace the previous Shaykh. Second, Zaynab claimed that the nomination letter written by her father in 1897 claiming Muhammad b al Hajj Muhammad to be the rightful successor was of doubtful authenticity or perhaps coerced, and written by her father when ‚Äòhis faculties were waning.‚Äô Zaynab and her cousin would compete for succession; a battle which included the support of both the local indigenous population and French colonial authorities. Whereas the Algerian Muslims accepted her rule, the French colonial authorities would have preferred instate her cousin. The Muslims Algerian population made their decisions based on worthiness and charisma as compared to the previous ruler, and inherited Baraka. Zaynab was seen to have inherited the Baraka of her father, and so was accepted by the majority of the community as the rightful leader. However, French disbelief in the notion of Baraka meant they would not recognize her ascension on the same grounds. For the colonial authorities, Zaynab was not only seen as unstable due her to will to challenge their authority, but also as unworthy due to inferiority as a woman. = Tactics to win support locally = Zaynab took bold actions in her struggle against her cousin. The struggle between the two eligible candidates led to a divide between the community. While many of the Rahmaniyya leaders in the region would have accepted her cousins rule, they opted for Zaynab's. Zaynab wrote letters to Rahmaniyya notables across the region to denounce her cousin. She also provided an ultimatum: all notables who chose to take her cousins side in this conflict would find the door to Zaynab and her Zawiya closed to them. This pushed many of the Rahmaniyya notables and religious clients towards Zaynab's side. They did not want to cut off their ties to her out of respect for her, and the fact that she greatly resembled her father, whose Baraka they believed she inherited, through her physical features and her mannerisms. = Tactics against the colonial administration = In order to fight this battle to the best of her ability, Zaynab used the colonial system to the disadvantage of the colonizers, constantly referring to French law and responsibilities. She reverted to intellectual and judicial measures as she knew that resorting to force would end in her losing the battle. Initially, she wrote to the Affaires Indig√®nes and the local colonial authorities to plead for their help in curbing her cousins ‚Äòinjustice and thievery,‚Äô later referring to the French legal system which followed ‚Äòequity and justice,‚Äô which should protect her. She would refer back the stability maintained during her father's rule, and argued that her succession would be logical in order to preserve this stability for the future. Additionally, she hired a lawyer, l‚ÄôAdmiral, which would take her case to the court in Algiers and represent her grievances against the French colonial administration. In her fight against the colonial administration, she managed to pit local officers against high-ranking official and win through a divide and rule strategy. The colonial administration knew she would recede, and not wanting to resort to force, they asked Bu Sa‚Äôadas army to step down and her cousin, Muhammad b. Al Hajj Muhammad, would be sidelined for the next 7 years, until he succeeded her upon her death. = Struggles beyond succession = Zaynab faced no further grievances from her cousin or the administration, ruling peacefully until 1899, when she came into conflict with an Algerian named Sa'id b. Lakhdar. Lakhdar claimed that he was owed two million francsby the belated Shaykh, and attempted to rally Bu Sa‚Äôada's military to take action against the Rahmaniyya. Zaynab wrote to the authorities, dispelling Lakhdar's claims, and demonstrating an intimate knowledge of all of her father's financial dealings. While Zaynab acted as a protector of her father's former harem of wives, Lakhdar demanded that they travelled to Algiers to swear an oath that they knew nothing of the money owed. Zaynab intervened and stated that the practice had no founding in either Islamic or French law, and instead offered her own oath on the tomb of a saintly tomb since the ex-wives were not party to the conflict. However, the rivalry over the spiritual succession continued, with Zaynab taking refuge in her father's tomb. With others present, when she cried out for answers, a voice announced that it was Zaynab who should lead her father's former followers. After this occurred, her leadership was no longer questioned. French artist Charles de Galland witnessed Zaynab and her followers seven months after the death of her father. They treated her as a living saint, and the true inheritor of her father's barakah. She would continue to lead the followers for the next seven years, with the French forces admitting in 1899 that the Zawiya had prospered under her leadership. Pilgrims remained as high under her stewardship as they had under her father's, and she adopted some of her father's practises such as inducting new members herself. She travelled throughout the local area; shrines were created by the local people at each of the places she stopped to pray. Isabelle Eberhardt would make several trips from Algiers to El Hamel to visit Zaynab's Zawiya, one among many Europeans who would visit her. Eberhardt would later say that she felt \\"rejuvenated\\" each time she met with Zaynab, and formed a friendship that would concern the authorities. Death Zaynab died of a prolonged disease on 19 November 1904. She was placed in a mausoleum alongside her father, with the tomb becoming a place of pilgrimage. She left an incredible legacy and maintained a strong memory in the hearts of the al-Hamil people for many years to come. She was succeeded by her cousin, Muhammad B Al Hajj Muhammad, who wasted al-Hamil's resources, and reverted the cultural struggle which Zaynab and her father fought to maintain. Under Muhammad's rule, the zawiya became an exoticized, marginalized, and localized center looking to entertain culturally bored or curious Western elites. Muhammad also took out large loans from the French which resulted in owed debt.

It first appeared on his 1981 album Dad Loves His Work. It was also released as a single, as the follow up to the Top-20 hit \\"Her Town Too.\\" It did not perform as well as its predecessor, reaching #72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #23 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The single's b-side, \\"Summer's Here,\\" performed similarly on the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at #25. Lyrics and music Like several other songs from Dad Loves His Work, \\"Hard Times\\" was influenced by the impending breakup of Taylor's marriage to Carly Simon. Fans heard the song as a message that the marriage was about to end. According to Rolling Stone critic Don Shewey, it \\"explores marriage on the rocks.\\" The lyrics describe the difficulty for an \\"angry man\\" and a \\"hungry woman\\" to stay together, and hope that the couple can stop \\"driving each other crazy.\\" They lament the way the pair hurt each other. The singer acknowledges that he can challenging to love. Taylor biographer Mark Robowsky describes the song's groove as \\"easygoing.\\" But he also claims that the song's refrain of \\"We've got to hold on, got to hold on\\" was a good hook, those lyrics were also false as by that time Taylor had already decided he did not want to hold on to his marriage with Simon. The song has an R&B; feel, which musicologist James Perone partially attributes to backing singers David Lasley and Arnold McCuller. Reception Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann regarded both \\"Hard Times\\" and \\"Summer's Here\\" among the better songs on Dad Loves His Work, helping Taylor bounce back from his previous \\"spotty\\" album Flag. Musician, Player, and Listener described it as sounding \\"more personal - especially as regards marital problems - than anything [Taylor] committed to wax in years.\\" Michigan Daily critic Ari Roth stated that \\"Hard Times\\" \\"assert[s] a dependency and will to achievement that Taylor has never previously articulated.\\" Michael Hochandel of Schenectady Gazette reported that \\"Hard Times\\" received as much applause in 1981 live performances as Taylor's classics. \\"Hard Times\\" was chosen for inclusion in the soundtrack to the 2002 PBS documentary Freedom: A History of Us. Allmusic' William Ruhlmann lamented its exclusion from the 2000 compilation album Greatest Hits Volume 2.

Perone describes the theme of \\"Summer's Here\\" as simply being a celebration of summer. Montreal Gazette critic John Griffin similarly described the song as \\"simply a goofy ode to 'my favorite time of year.'\\" Although the character in the song states that summer is his favorite season, Taylor has claimed that this is just that character speaking, and that Taylor's own favorite season is the Fall and his favorite month is October. The lyrics to \\"Summer's Here\\" incorporate a common trope in Taylor's songs, that of the open sea. Perone describes the music as being Caribbean- style, while Schenectady Gazette critic Michael Hochandel described the music as reggae. Musician, Player, and Listener similarly described it as having Caribbean influence, calling it a \\"momentary ray of sunshine.\\" Taylor biographer Timothy White called the song \\"infectious.\\" Terry Hazlet of the Observer-Reporter rated \\"Summer's Here\\" as the best song on Dad Loves His Work and \\"the closest Taylor came to his real roots,\\" albeit because he considered it \\"simplistic\\" and because the focus on objects such as sandals, beer and hats \\"make the human element,\\" which he found lacking on other songs on the album, \\"unnecessary.\\" Perone rates it as \\"not one of Taylor's more lyrically or musically substantial works\\" but states that it \\"serves as a break from some of the darker and more serious lyrics on Dad Loves His Work.\\" Personnel *James Taylor ‚Äì lead vocals, acoustic guitar *Waddy Wachtel, Dan Dugmore *Leland Sklar ‚Äì bass guitar *Rick Marotta ‚Äì drums, timbales *Don Grolnick ‚Äì electric piano, organ *Greg \\"Fingers\\" Taylor harmonia *Peter Asher ‚Äì shaker *Greg \\"Fingers\\" Taylor harmonica References External links * Category:1981 songs Category:1981 singles Category:James Taylor songs Category:Songs written by James Taylor Category:Song recordings produced by Peter Asher Category:Columbia Records singles ","title":"Hard Times (James Taylor song)"},{"id":"43136883","text":"Synaptojanin 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SYNJ2 gene.

Prior to the release of The Next Four Years, United Nations released \\"Serious Business\\" and \\"Meanwhile on Main Street\\" for online streaming. Release formats =Box set= While the album was released in more traditional formats, The Next Four Years was meant to be experienced as a boxed set. The boxed-set version was limited to 1,000 copies that were hand- assembled by the members of United Nations, and features all 11 tracks found on other formats, but split between a cassette tape, a 10\\" vinyl record and two 7\\" vinyl records. The cover art of the boxed set features fake news articles and the cassette tape was wrapped in a copy of the actual cease-and- desist letter sent by the actual United Nations. As a boxed set, the series of different formats are meant be a concept album that illustrates and critiques the evolution of the band members themselves from an underground basement act to an experimental. United Nations vocalist Geoff Rickly explained: \\"This record is more developed and mature because we decided that the best form of critique isn't political or punk critique; it's critiquing ourselves. So the record is a lot more personal‚Äîa lists of all the ways we've failed all the things we once believed in, and accepting the status quo of how band things have gotten. It's sort of examining our own level of privilege. The box set is supposed to be a fake mythology of the band.

It was one of three companies specializing in the production of commercial vehicles, two of them, ENASA and AISA, were controlled by the Spanish government through the INI. The third was VIASA, a division of parent company Construcciones y Auxiliares de Ferrocariles (CAF) that built railway cars and locomotives. Production began in 1960, and soon local content of all components was achieved. Vehicles used Perkins and Barreiros gasoline or diesel engines. In the early 1960s, VIASA also manufactured FIAT models 211R, 411R, and 421R tractors under license. In 1963, Forward control versions went on sale offering a range of models with an advanced cockpit. These were completely unique from any other Jeep-based vehicles anywhere in the world. Versions included pick-up, van, chassis cab and duplex cabin. All carried a Perkins diesel engine that allowed them to cruise at one hundred kilometers per hour. In 1968, VIASA merged with Material M√≥vil y Construcciones S.A. In 1974, it was absorbed by Motor Ib√©rica and placed under Ebro trucks. In the early eighties the Viasa vehicles disappeared from the Motor Ib√©rica catalog, to be replaced by the Nissan Vanette and Nissan Patrol.

As of 2012, it was the most popular show in Senegal. The show is a contest to locate the most beautiful ram in the country and airs each year in the lead-up to the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha (known locally as Tabaski). Sheep play an important role in Senegalese culture. They are popular pets, often living inside their owners' homes. In addition, sheep are important to the festival of Eid al-Adha, which commemorates Abraham's near sacrifice of his son (and ultimate sacrifice of a ram in Isaac's place). Nearly every Senegalese Muslim family with sufficient resources sacrifices a sheep to celebrate Eid al-Adha; over 700,000 sheep are purchased annually for this purpose. The show's creator, Marianne Bathily, aimed to create a spectacle akin to an American dog show. Khar Bii follows judges (breeders and veterinarians) who visit homes across the country, selecting rams to compete in televised regional competitions. Later, the regional finalists compete in a national contest in Dakar's Place de l'Ob√©lisque. Judges examine rams for symmetry of horns and testicles, a balanced face, a shiny coat, and a healthy, hefty weight. The ram's gait is also considered. The winner of the competition receives 2,000,000 francs (approximately US$4,000), as well as the potential for future income through breeding of the winning ram. Khar Bii also incorporates a women's mutton cooking competition. (Prize-quality rams, like those competing in Khar Bii, are used for breeding rather than for food.)

Retrieved 25 June 2014 The first mention of a priest is of Geoffrey de Temple in 1225, attendant to the Knights Templar who had established a preceptory at Aslackby the previous century. In 1164 benefactor Hubert de Rye provided a church and round chapel for the Templars, the remains of which stood until the 18th century when it became part of a farmhouse. The preceptory itself was probably founded in 1194 following the 1185 patronage of Robert de Rye. In 1312 the Templar preceptory was appropriated by King Edward II, and by 1338 it had been transferred to the Knights Hospitaller with an income of ¬£40 per annum as a messuage--including church and associated land--under the control of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster. Following this the preceptory for administrative purposes became part of the previous Knights Templar property of Temple Bruer. The first Knights Hospitaller sponsored priest at Aslackby was Nicholas de Camelton in 1321. In 1541-42, following the dissolution of the monasteries, the lands were granted to Edward, Lord Clinton and his wife, Ursula. Parts of the original Templar round church still existed until 1800. The remaining preceptory tower was demolished in 1891. The building of the present St James' church was begun c.1300, conjoined to the appropriated Templar property. The church was extended in the mid-15th century, with a further restoration in 1856 at which time the chancel was rebuilt.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire 1933, p.42Cox, J.

It comprises a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, a west tower and a south porch, and is of Early English and Perpendicular styles.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John: The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire, Penguin (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram (1989), Yale University Press, p. 440\\\\. The tower is early 14th-century, Perpendicular, and of two stages--a tall lower stage, with belfry above--and is partly clasped by the north and south aisles. Angled buttresses of three steps run at each corner to the belfry stage and are continued to near the parapet by square shafts, topped by crocketed pinnacles set away from the tower face. On both west corners the buttresses sit on a moulded socle (plinth) topped by a cill band--angled projection that allows water to flow from a building face--that continues in this style around the tower and south aisle only. The north-east and south-east buttresses spring from the north and south aisle and nave roofs. The north-west corner has a five-sided stair turret built out from the tower, with a slit window at the west, and belfry stairs within. Between each angle buttress, except those at the stair turret corner, is a projecting gargoyle at the height of the clerestory parapet. The tower 14th-century west doorway is pointed, with four set-back continuous mouldings set on a single running plinth. Around the doorway, from the spring, is a hood mould. Within the doorway is a plank double door with large decorative iron face hinges. Tower showing the west door, and window within the blind arch Above the west tower door is a large blocked pointed arch, chamfered above the spring, and vertically edged with round moulded jambs ending in open cusped devices. Around the arch is a hood mould. Within the arch is a 14th-century (Pevsner) or late 15th-century (National Heritage) window surrounded by a hood mould. The window opening jambs are single- chamfered, with the arch double-chamfered, and lead to a Perpendicular window. The lower part of the window is of three lights, separated by chamfered mullions and divided and topped by transoms containing castellated details, with tracery of trefoil heads and spandrels. Two further ranks of lights above are subdivided vertically into panel tracery--a Perpendicular style of upright straight openings above lower lights--with 'Y' tracery, trefoil heads, and quatrefoil openings. All lights are clear glazed within diamond leading. On the south and north side of the tower are blocked arches mirroring that on the west side, but cut through by the later added north and south aisles. Pevsner debates whether these arches are \\"relieving arches\\" or decorative. Within the north blocked arch is a protruding 15th-century capped vent stack supported by corbels. A string-course runs between the tower lower and belfry stages. Each belfry side contains a pointed arch opening of same style surrounded by a hood mould. A straight reveal leads to a louvered twin-light window with trefoiled ogee head, and a quatrefoil device above. The south belfry window also contains the tower clock: circular, blue, with gold numerals and hands. The tower parapet is embattled with a pinnacle at each corner. It projects slightly at the eaves and contains one gargoyle each side offset to the right. The 13th-century north aisle is of limestone and ironstone work, with a string course at the eaves, and a plinth--defined by a simple raised band below the line of the windows--broken by an blocked chamfered and arched doorway to the west end. Both ends of the aisle are supported by clasping buttresses terminated with gables. An angled buttress of the same style sits between the two identical rectangular north windows, each of three lights with cusped ogee heads. The north aisle pointed west window opening has a chamfered reveal and a hood mould, with an inset window of two simple pointed lights. The pointed east window with hood mould is of four lights--two central lights, with cusped heads with quatrefoil device above, define a dropped section of the cill below, with a simple raised pointed light each side. All north aisle windows are clear glazed. Above the aisle runs a plain parapet which meets a raised half gable at the east and west ends. The south aisle with cusped parapet, and clerestory with octagonal turret The south aisle is early 14th century. It is supported by twin-stepped clasping buttresses at the south-east and south-west corners, and an angle buttress on the south side. A moulded string course runs at the eaves, and a plinth just below the window line. There are five windows: one at the east end; one at the west end; and three at the south with two of these at the west separated by the church porch. The east window is of concave chamfered intersecting 'Y' tracery, creating three lights set within a chamfered pointed arch with hood mould. The west window is similar, but narrower, and of two lights. The south wall windows are identical: rectangular chamfered openings within which are three lights with cusped ogee heads. The parapet is of a coping set above a repeated c.17th-century cusped fretwork device. The Perpendicular nave is defined at the exterior by its mid-15th- century clerestory. It is of three pairs of windows each side, separated by buttresses as gable-topped pilasters. Each pair is of shallow-arched openings with hood moulds incorporating both. Each window is of two ogee-headed lights and cusping, with central quatrefoils above. The clerestory is topped by an embattled parapet with a diamond frieze below which, at the south-east end, meets an octagonal turret with castelations, faceted spire and finial. This turret houses stairs from the south aisle to the roof. The east end of the nave roof rises to a gable end on which sits a gabled bell-cot, originally for a sanctus bell. South porch, with south aisle cutting through the earlier blind arch The chancel is of the 1856 rebuild and restoration. It is of ironstone and limestone work with a Collyweston slate roof. Ashlar is used in the east wall above the spring of the east window, and in the cornerstones and plinth. Twin stepped diagonal buttresses are at the south-east and north-east corners, with a further angled buttress on the south wall. A moulded plinth runs below windows on the east wall, and on the south wall where at the west, it is broken by a pointed doorway with chamfered opening and hood mould; the door is planked with decorative metal face hinges. On the south side are three windows of identical style and construction, with twin lights and 'Y' tracery set within a chamfered pointed arch. The north side contains two identical plain lancet windows. The chancel east window with hood mould is of three lights with intersecting 'Y' tracery within a double-chamfered surround. Immediately to the east of the east window is a table tomb within iron railings, to Mary Skelton (died 1767). The church south porch is 15th-century. It is a gabled structure with a cross finial at the centre, and crocketed pinnacles at each corner of its south face. It is set on a plinth which runs over diagonal buttresses at the south corners. A string course runs into a hood mould surrounding a blocked pointed window opening at both the east and west side. The pointed doorway arch is hood moulded, and has a continuous chamfered surround meeting a flat reveal, which in turn holds a further roll mould arch ending at the spring with capitals unsupported by piers. Within the porch are stone benches either side. The nave door, with its wrought iron face hinges, sits inside an arched opening with continuous moulded reveal surround, with simple chamfered hood mould above. =Interior= Tower arch from the nave The tall c.13th-century tower arch is of a continuous triple chamfer leading to triple part-circular shafts terminating in moulded capitals at the height of the nave clerestory. A hood mould surrounds the arch to the same height of the blocked arches in the north, west and east sides. It finishes at the spring with the same open cusped devices as found on the equivalent internal arches on each side, and that on the external west wall. The plank door to the stair turret is at the north west, and sits within a continuous surround mould with pointed head. The lower part of the tower arch, behind which is a meeting room, is closed off by a 20th-century wood screen of traceried panels, the central of which are open above a glazed double door. Within the tower, on the north side is a restored arched Hanoverian royal coat of arms. The tower contains one bell by Thomas Newcombe of Leicester (c.1550) and three by Tobias Norris of Stamford (1611; 1622; c.1683). Only three of the bells are used today.\\"Aslackby\\", Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers, 3 December 2013. Retrieved 25 June 2014 The nave north and south arcades leading to the north and south aisles are of three bays each, and date to the 13th century. The arcade pointed arches, of double-faceted flat and rounded mouldings, sit on piers incorporating four rounded columns each with a central raised flat projection continuous along the full length. Between each rounded column is a continuous annulet (flat hollow). The piers' capitals and abaci are flat-faced Doric of five sides; the deep base octagonal and moulded. A continuous hood mould runs above the arches throughout each arcade. The 15th- century nave roof is of tie beam construction; it was restored in the 19th century when stone corbels and cross braces were replaced. Within the nave, beneath the tower arch, is a 14th-century octagonal font (PastScape: 15th- century). The stone plinth and bowl is panelled on each side: the plinth with plain recessed fields, each alternate with carved twin flower-head reliefs; the bowl with panels of carved quatrefoils with inset shields, alternating with blind tracery. A font cover is of plain wood, with eight raised pink open scrolls attached meeting an octagonal shaft topped by a gold-painted urn. Chancel arch from the nave The pointed chancel arch is 13th century. It is moulded of three chamfers leading to responds--half-piers against a wall supporting an arch--of three part round columns with continuous annulet between, and with polygonal capitals and base reflecting those of the arcade piers. At the spring of the arch are open cusped devices similar to those on the tower arch. The chancel roof is 19th century and of barrel vault construction. In the north wall of the chancel is a rectangular aumbry. In the south wall is an arched door, of planking over cross bracing and heavy surrounds, recessed within a plain right angle opening with pointed and chamfered double-arch head. From the 19th-century restoration are chancel altar rails, choir stalls, a brass eagle lectern, and a wood pulpit. The pulpit is octagonal with one side open and receiving steps. The upper level is moulded top and bottom, with each side paneled with inset tracery and quatrefoils, and is supported by scrolled brackets set on an inset base. The 13th-century south aisle contains the church square-paneled and plank south door, that is recessed to the same style as the chancel south door. A further small plank door at the south aisle north-east wall is within a pointed doorway with a continuous moulded surround, an entrance to a previous rood loft, defined externally by the south aisle turret. To the east of the door are twin aumbries. In the south wall is a 14th-century piscina with cusped head, set within an ogee headed recess. The north aisle, also 13th-century, contains within the north side of the chancel arch pier a further piscina with a seven-cusped arch surround with spandrels within a rectilinear frame, this sitting on a projecting ledge, with above, an entablature containing three floriate carvings; running on the entablature are crenellations. In the north wall is a further aumbry with wooden door. At the west end of the north aisle sits the church organ. Memorials Tablet to Thomas Green, and his wife aged 5 [sic] On the south aisle south wall at the west end is a white marble memorial tablet with entablature, set on a grey marble surround, to Samuel Darby (died 1819), and his wife, Frances (died 1837). To its east is a wall memorial as an oval white marble plaque set on a grey marble field, set within a fluted pilaster frame with flower-head devices at the top corners. The plaque is supported below by a fluted shelf held by floriate-carved corbels, with apron between. Above the pilasters is a shelf on which sits a carved marble relief chalice with decorative friezing. This memorial is to Thomas Green, who died 1793, and his wife, Susannah, who died 1801, aged 5 years [sic]. Further to the east is a grey marble oval plaque supported by a single scrolled corbel, to Colby Graves (died 1799, aged 17), and his mother Grace Graves (died 1824, aged 75). The most eastern south aisle tablet is a white marble memorial on a black marble ground with urn above, to Samuel Newzam (died 1826); his wife, Ann (died 1799); his and Ann's sons, John (died 1788), and Henry (died 1802). North aisle wall memorials include a tablet at the east end, of white marble on black marble ground, to Joseph Barwis (died 1828), Aslackby vicar from 1798, and his wife, Bridget (died 1834). At the apposite end of the aisle is an oval white marble tablet to Colby Graves (died 1791, aged 41). A black memorial floor slab in the nave is to Mary Quincy (died 1780, aged 88), a co-heiress of John Quincy. A further small black nave slab is to John Edward Oldham (1808-1846). On the chancel north wall is a pink marble plaque dedicated to eleven Aslackby men who died in the First World War. The memorial is repeated twice in the nave at the south of the tower arch, by a framed brass plaque and a printed and framed Roll of Honour. Within the south porch is a handwritten dedication to all Aslackby men who served in the \\"European War\\" of 1914 to 1919, signed by Rev Robert Stanley Coupland and churchwardens, referring to the tower memorial church clock erected in 1920 for this purpose.\\"Aslackby War Memorial\\", Roll of honour.com.

Background \\"Attitude\\" was a late addition to the Low Budget album, as it was not featured in early running orders of the album (songs such as \\"Destroyer\\", \\"Massive Reductions\\", and \\"Give the People What They Want\\" were used instead in early versions.) Release \\"Attitude\\" was first released on the Low Budget album in 1979 as the opening track of said LP. The next year, a live version of the track appeared on the One for the Road album. This version would appear afterwards as the B-side of the live \\"You Really Got Me\\" single that same year. The song has also appeared on compilation albums such as The Kinks Greatest 1970-1986 and Picture Book. Critical opinion \\"Attitude\\" was called \\"possibly [The Kinks'] best hard rocker of the era\\" by AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who also referred to the song as a highlight from Low Budget. Richard Gilliam (also of AllMusic) said, \\"Favorably reminiscent of the best songs of their British Invasion days, 'Attitude' is a straight-forward, hard- rock effort, laced, of course, with front man Ray Davies‚Äôs energetically satirical vocals. The lead track on their 1979 Low Budget album, the song mocks the superficiality of the emerging image-obsessed 1980s. There‚Äôs a welcome maturity to the effort ‚Äì as if Davies is more than willing to adopt the motifs of the era to enhance the substance of his message. Sociological considerations aside, this is a solidly good song musically, and one of the Kinks best mid-career hard-rock efforts.\\" Rolling Stone said, \\"[Ray Davies's] muse takes a short vacation for 'Attitude,' which is humorlessly accusatory almost to the point of being reactionary.\\" On his Facebook account, Dave Davies praised the song as \\"one of my fave Kinks tracks.\\" References External links * Category:The Kinks songs Category:Songs written by Ray Davies Category:Song recordings produced by Ray Davies Category:1979 songs ","title":"Attitude (The Kinks song)"},{"id":"43137228","text":"Mount Hillers is a summit in the Henry Mountains range, in Garfield County, Utah, in the United States.

The film stars Chase Williamson as the Sparks, Ashley Bell as the Lady Heavenly, Clancy Brown, Jake Busey, William Katt, Marina Squerciati and Clint Howard among others. Plot Ian Sparks (Chase Williamson) discovers the dark side of heroism, while going after the nation's most notorious super-criminal he manages to leave his life and reputation in ruins along the way. The tragic loss of his parents as a young boy leaves him scarred in unimaginable ways, but it helps shape his desire to become a \\"super\\". He manages to team up with fellow ‚Äúsuper‚Äù Lady Heavenly (Ashley Bell), but the arrival of a vicious serial killer, Matanza (William Katt), who unleashes a bloody rampage on the city, destroys Sparks and Heavenly‚Äôs partnership and relationship. Racked with guilt, Sparks hits rock bottom, only to be saved by a guardian angel Archer (Clancy Brown), a cop whose own tragedy was linked to the fate of Sparks‚Äô parents. Archer and Sparks discover their common enemy, which brings together a partnership of other ‚Äúgifted‚Äù individuals whose intentions are not as honorable as Sparks. Hitting rock bottom again, Sparks looks to make an easy buck, but finds danger along the way.

This comic came from scratch with all new ideas from both Katt and Folino. After finishing the writing for the comic, they found Tyler Endicott and JM Ringuet to complete the project with the pictures. In 2011, Christopher Folino along with producers Tyler Endicott and James Sutton started production for the movie that became Sparks based on the comic book. Executive produced by Angelina Folino, Rose Folino, and William Katt with producers Todd Burrows, Brett Carleton, Max Carlson, Gregg Nolan, Manuel Silva, and Chase Williamson, the movie started production in January 2012 with two crews simultaneously at different locations in a two-week period. Burrows, the director of the movie, tells Filmoria that ‚Äú It was a difficult dance, especially when you deal with shooting out of context and out of story order.‚Äù However, Folino states that with Bell and Williamson, the film‚Äôs lead, and his 80-90 person crew, it was completely possible. Release In August 2013, Archstone Distribution announced that they had acquired the rights to the film for international release, while Image Entertainment distributed the movie within the United States and Canada.

Early life and career before New York Hain was the eldest of five children of Pennsylvania German parents, Samuel Hain and Margaret Fitzenberger Kintzel. He was born in Stouchsburg, where he was educated at Tulpehocken Academy. Around 1850, the family moved to Reading, where he started work at 17 in 1853 as an apprentice machinist with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad.Peter Murray Hain, Frank K. Hain and the Manhattan Railway Company: The Elevated Railway, 1875-1903, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2011, , pp. 37-38. He left in 1857 to join the Navy as an assistant engineer, and served aboard USS Colorado from January to August 1858. He then returned to Pennsylvania and opened a leather business in Danville.Hain, p. 39. The month after the outbreak of the Civil War, in May 1861, Hain re-enlisted in the Union Navy. He served aboard USS Iroquois until she was decommissioned in October 1862; he was then assigned to USS Sangamon but because of persistent ill health--during his time on the Iroquois he had been in sickbay for adynamia, diarrhea, and malaria and also been wounded--he did not join the ship and his resignation was accepted in January 1863.Hain, pp. 40-42. In 1863-64, he worked as a draftsman for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in Scranton. During this time he also served for about a month as a captain in the Pennsylvania Infantry Militia, commanding 102 men; his nickname of \\"Colonel\\" dates from this service, although he never held that rank or, apparently, saw action.Hain, pp. 42-43. In March 1864, he became a master mechanic for the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad; on January 1, 1865, he was promoted to superintendent of motive power.Hain, p. 43. Two years later, in January 1867, he became a lead draftsman at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, where he lived in company housing with his brother George, who was a foreman machinist. The company used a system of standardized interchangeable parts to design locomotives to fit the needs of a variety of customers, many foreign; Hain was responsible for designing the first anthracite-burning locomotives for Russia, and traveled there in 1871 to meet with government representatives.Hain, pp. 44-47. He then became Supervisor of the Susquehanna Depot of the Erie Railroad from 1874 to 1876, and general superintendent and purchasing agent for the Keokuk & Des Moines Railroad, then following its purchase by the Rock Island Railroad, superintendent of the Keokuk & Des Moines division of the Rock Island Railroad. In 1880, after the railroad changed its name to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, he accepted an offer from Jay Gould--a board member of the Rock Island Railroad and former president of the Erie Railroad--to become general manager of the Manhattan Railway Company.Hain, pp. 48-49. General Manager of the Manhattan Railway Company Hain was first master mechanic and then general manager of the Manhattan Railway Company, which operated the elevated lines in Manhattan and the Bronx, from March 1880 until his death; in 1891 he became second vice- president.J. R. Stilwell, E. L. Wright, D. R. Cafferty, and A. H. MacFarlane, \\"Col. Frank K. Hain\\", Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers' Monthly Journal 30 (1896) 598-99, p. 598. Despite financial difficulties so severe that the company was in receivership for three months in 1881, and continuing problems with labor unions, he succeeded in cutting costs and making the company profitable. Although no passengers were killed on the trains, there were numerous accidents that killed workers and people getting off and on, and the company was constantly attacked as mercenary and uncaring by the newspapers, especially The New York Times. Yet after his death, Hain was eulogized by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers as \\"a true friend and almost a father\\" to his employees, with \\"a strict sense of justice in administering between his company\\" and them,Stilwell, Wright, Cafferty, and MacFarlane, p. 599. in the Brooklyn Eagle as \\"regard[ing] the company [not] as a commodity or speculation, but as a public agency\\", and by The New York Times as chiefly responsible for the fact the elevated railroad had, \\"[on] the practical side\\", been \\"admirably handled\\", and as having been \\"a stranger to the stock jobbing and the litigation of its owners\\".\\"Col. Hain\\", Editorial, The New York Times, May 12, 1896.Hain, p. 132. Sickness and death Hain showed increasing signs of nervous breakdown in his last two years on the job, and finally took a vacation in Washington, D.C., and Virginia early in 1896. On his doctor's insistence, he was then persuaded to enter Clifton Springs Sanitarium in Western New York for a complete rest. His wife accompanied him and reported that he appeared to be recovering well, but on May 9 he committed suicide by crawling under a New York Central freight train.Hain, p. 131.\\"Col. F.K. Hain Killed; Crushed by a Freight Train at Clifton Springs, N.Y.\\", The New York Times, May 9, 1896. An editorial in The New York Times three days later called it \\"a martyrdom to duty.\\" 4,000 employees of the Manhattan Railway Company raised $2,500 to erect a granite monument 7 feet high and 9 feet wide at his burial place in the Presbyterian Cemetery in Danville, Pennsylvania. It was dedicated on May 26, 1897; \\"thousands\\" of railroaders, including approximately 200 from the company, attended.Hain, pp. 136-39.\\"Col.

Personal life Hain married Annie McWilliams of Mooresburg, Pennsylvania, on January 23, 1861.Hain, p. 40. She was a suffragist and a member of the Portia Club, which advocated the appointment of a female judge; she studied law in a special women's program at New York University.Hain, p. 113. In New York, they lived in the Navarro Apartments or \\"Spanish Flats\\" on 58th St.Hain, pp. 67-68. They had one child, Rebecca McWilliams Hain, born while Hain was at sea on the Iroquois; she died in 1866 aged four and a half.Hain, pp. 41, 43. Hain was convinced he was descended from the Dutch admiral Piet Pieterszoon Hein, probably incorrectly since his ancestors were from the Palatinate.Hain, p. 140.

He meets the Earl of Rochester (Faversham), and the similarity between the two is so noticeable that even friends mistake Jones for the Earl. The Earl is estranged from his wife (Hopper) and family, owes great sums of money, and is considered in a bad light by acquaintances. He gets Jones drunk and sends him to the Rochester mansion, and then commits suicide. Until Jones receives a note written by the Earl prior to his death, he does not perceive his position.

Recording The Night We Called It a Day was recorded in one week in Dallas, Texas, in the apartment of group member Playdough. It was produced by Beat Rabbi, DJ Dust, Freddie Bruno, and Playdough, with Playdough producing under a different moniker, Harry Krum. During the recording sessions, the group met future member Sivion. Lyrics and musical style The album features an underground, anti-commercial style. Jayson Young of RapReviews.com called the album \\"strictly ground-roots, MC/DJ, hard-core hip-hop\\". Young also found Listener's vocal style similar to Son Doobie, and noted that \\"Stick This In Your Ear\\" includes a flute sample. Jon Corbin, writing for cMusicWeb.com, noted that on \\"World Go Round\\", Beat Rabbi brings a progressive jazz feel through the use of drum patterns and bass lines. Jesus Freak Hideout's Chanile Campbell described the album as east coast \\"smooth and a little jazzy\\". RapReviews.com and Sam Gunnell of Cross Rhythms also described the album as very chill and laid back, with Gunnell commenting that \\"If there is such a thing as easy listening hip hop, then this is definitely it!\\" Thomas Quinlan of Exclaim! described the lyrical content of the album as mostly \\"high concept songs\\", but with some testimonials and praises to God. Sam Gunnell of Cross Rhythms and Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic both noted that the album's lyrics are intellectual and often humorous. Several reviewers noted the unusual verse by Listener on \\"Stick This In Your Ear\\", where he reads off a paragraph exactly as written ‚Äì including punctuation. Jason Young wrote that Listener \\"literally says every period, comma, and semi-colon found in his verse.\\" Also highlighted by reviewers was the skit \\"Close Caption\\", where Listener translates a sign language rap by \\"MC Fong\\". Critical reception Critics responded quite favorably to the album. AllMusic rated the album three out of five stars, and found the album's seven-minute-plus long title track to be the standout track. Jon Corbin of cMusicWeb.com wrote \\"Locked in Playdough's apartment, these boys got their creative juices flowing and whipped up something sweet, an album that reclaims hip-hop for the emcee.\\" Corbin considered all of the songs well-crafted and developed, with the exceptions of \\"Murder Creek\\" and \\"Take the Rhythm\\", tracks which Corbin said will have the listener hitting the skip button. These tracks aside, he summarized: > The production is very strong, especially considering that the album was > created in a week. In all in all, this is a very good disc, filled with a > wide range of topics to get your brain working and your head nodding. Sam Gunnell of Cross Rhythms rated the album eight out of ten squares and stated that when he first heard Deepspace5, he dismissed the group as \\"just another depressing Christian rap group\\", but that this release proved him wrong. Exclaim!'s Thomas Quinlan opined that \\"Deepspace 5 demonstrate skills on their debut album that should get them respect, regardless of the message\\" and concluded that the group \\"is another example that Christian hip-hop is taking great strides forward.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four stars, calling Deepspace5 \\"the hip hop that has been missed in the Christian music industry until now\\". RapReviews.com scored the album nine out of ten, expressing that while the album displays some flaws typical of underground hip hop, namely that it avoids \\"party-starters\\", instead preferring to stay \\"laid back and mellow\\", and also that sometimes the songs start to all sound the same, but concluded that \\"Look past those tiny flaws and you'll find a fantastic rap album with enough depth to keep you coming back again and again. Hard beats and hard rhymes in a tight overall package is just the beginning here.\\" Rapzilla gave the album a four out of five and stated: > Deepspace5 represents some of the best talent hip hop has to offer which > makes it absolutely shameful that The Night... was basically released under > the rug. The push on this project was surprisingly minimal and as the rumors > of a sophomore release tickle my ears, I only hope that things change.

It can be found in dry shrubland at all elevations of the islands. A. caymanensis gradually forms a short trunk, that is clothed in dead leaves. It can reach heights of 4 m and widths of 3 m with a rosette of massive, succulent leaves rimmed with thorns. It is monocarpic, and flowering is quite synchronous. Young rock iguanas sometimes use the hollow core of dead flower spikes as a refuge. This species was previously confused with A. sobolifera until described by Proctor as a separate species in 2012. This species has a generation length of 20‚Äì70 years, and is a co-dominant species in the dry (xerophytic) shrublands of the Caymans. Due to its declining population and limited range, the IUCN declared A. caymanensis an endangered plant. It is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation caused by all forms of development on the islands, including deforestation, urban and tourism development and conversion to agriculture. It is estimated that there are now just over 1 million extant plants, a dramatic decrease from three generations ago, when the population was estimated to be 1.3 to 1.5 million individuals. It is projected that the population will decrease by 61% over the next 60 to 100 years. It may become susceptible to an invasive agave-eating weevil, Scyphophorus acupunctatus, which impacts similar habitats on nearby islands.

He has been the head coach of Central Connecticut since the 2000 season, leading the Blue Devils to six NCAA Tournaments. Previously, he was the head coach at Providence for three seasons (1997‚Äì1999). Providence announced it was cutting the program prior to the 1999 season, but the team won that year's Big East title and advanced to an NCAA Regional final. Coaching career =Collegiate summer baseball= Before becoming an NCAA head coach, Hickey was an assistant with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League from 1992‚Äì1994, and head coach of the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Eastern Tides in 1996. =Providence= Hickey began his coaching career as an assistant at Providence in the 1992 season. He held the position for five years, then became head coach when Paul Kostacopoulos left to become the head coach at Maine following the 1996 season. Hickey coached Providence for three seasons (1997‚Äì1999). In 1997, the Friars missed the Big East Tournament. In 1998, the team won 31 games and earned a Big East Tournament berth. There, it lost its opening game to St. John's, then defeated Rutgers and West Virginia before being eliminated by Notre Dame. In October 1998, Providence announced it would cut its baseball program following the 1999 season, due to Title IX's gender equity requirements. During that season, Providence finished third in the Big East and went 49‚Äì16 to set a New England record for wins. It also swept the conference's major awards, with Hickey named Coach of the Year. At the Big East Tournament, the Friars started off 1‚Äì1, defeating fourth-seeded Seton Hall in the opening game, then losing to second-seeded Rutgers. It then won three consecutive games (over Notre Dame, Rutgers, and St. John's) to win the tournament and receive the Big East's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. As a two-seed at the Tallahassee Regional, the Friars lost their opener to Jacksonville, 7‚Äì5. They staved off elimination with a 12‚Äì1 win over The Citadel. In the 1‚Äì1 game (a rematch against Jacksonville), Providence fell behind 7‚Äì1, but rallied to win 9‚Äì8 in a game that saw a bench-clearing brawl and support from Florida State's fans. In the regional championship, Florida State defeated the Friars, 14‚Äì3, in the program's final game. The team's season was the subject of a book by Paul Lonardo and received national attention in the debate over Title IX. =Central Connecticut= Hickey was offered the head coaching position at Central Connecticut (which he accepted) by retiring CCSU coach George Redman. Under Hickey, CCSU had a great deal of success in the early 2000s. The Blue Devils qualified for the NCAA Tournament in 2002, 2003, and 2004, also winning NEC regular season titles in 2001 and 2006. Hickey was named NEC Coach of the Year in 2001, 2003, and 2006. Since 2006, CCSU has not won an NEC regular season title, but the Blue Devils won the NEC Tournament in 2010 to reach their fourth NCAA Tournament under Hickey. In 2012, Hickey surpassed Hank Majlinger to become Central Connecticut's winningest coach. In 2013, he won his 500th career game. In 2014, multiple Blue Devils were selected in the Major League Baseball Draft for the first time in his tenure at CCSU‚Äì pitcher Nick Neumann was taken by the Pirates, and outfielder J.P.

The vigils are explicitly not left-wing or right-wing in political orientation, although they are inspired by the Monday demonstrations in East Germany that took place in 1989 and 1990. The vigils were triggered by the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine and the concerns it generated in Germany about conflict and war, but a primary focus has been the Federal Reserve System in the United States and its argued effects on the global economy and political events.  Vigils  Sticker calling for participation in the Hamburg Vigil The first \\"vigil for peace\\" was organized in March 2014 Brandenburg Gate in Berlin by Lars M√§hrholz, a professional skydiver and entrepreneur. Its slogan was: \\"For peace in Europe and the world, for an honest press, and against the deadly politics of the Federal Reserve (a private bank).\\" (German: \\"F√ºr Frieden in Europa, auf der Welt, f√ºr eine ehrliche Presse und gegen die t√∂dliche Politik der Federal Reserve [einer privaten Bank].\\") One of the speakers at the first vigil was Ken Jebsen, a former television and radio anchor for the Rundfunk Berlin- Brandenburg, and he soon became a prominent figure in the movement and the regularly-occurring vigils in Berlin. The vigils in Berlin were soon emulated by other activists in over 80 other cities in German-speaking countries, who used Facebook and social media to set the meeting times and locations. At the beginning of June, organizers of several vigils also gathered in Senftenberg.  Speakers  In addition to Jebsen, journalist J√ºrgen Els√§sser and Andreas Popp, a critic of the interest-based banking system, spoke at the first vigil. In May, other speakers included musician Prinz Chaos and former Attac activist Pedram Shahyar. On June 9, Diether Dehm, a politician of The Left party, spoke and sang at the Berlin vigil, triggering internal party discussions about the value and political orientation of the movement.  Participants  In May 2014, the Center for Technology and Society (\\"Zentrum Technik und Gesellschaft\\") at the Technical University of Berlin administered a survey of vigil participants. They reported that their survey showed that participants were younger, better educated, and more active on the Internet than the average member of the German public. 38% of participants identified themselves more with the left, although a greater percentage, 39%, rejected the left-right political schema entirely. In terms of voting orientation in the 2013 Bundestag elections, participants displayed overproportional votes for The Left, the Pirate Party, and the Alternative for Germany party. A third of participants did not vote or did not enter valid ballots.  Reception  Some members of the Left Party, including Andrej Hunko, Heike H√§nsel, Sabine Leidig, and Volker K√ºlow, have argued that solidarity with the vigils is worthwhile. However, on May 25 and 26, the official federal party organ distanced itself from the vigils, arguing that the claimed participation of \\"right-wing populists, nationalists, conspiracy theorists, and anti-Semites\\" can serve to make Third Position strategies \\"socially acceptable\\".

The facility was also known as Federal Office Building 2. It was demolished in 2013 to make room for an expansion of Arlington National Cemetery and other uses. Early history The Navy Annex was originally built as a warehouse in 1941, with one million square feet of space arranged into eight wings. It housed 6000 workers at its peak. The building was not considered to be architecturally distinguished, and it was never renovated during its lifetime except for minor upgrades made in the 1970s. In November 1941, the United States Marine Corps moved their headquarters from the Main Navy Building on the National Mall to the Navy Annex, where it would stay until 1996. During this time the Commandant of the Marine Corps was the only one of the four Department of Defense service chiefs who did not have his office in the Pentagon. The Missile Defense Agency also came to be located in the Navy Annex. During the September 11 attacks, when the Navy Command Center at the Pentagon was destroyed, it was reconstituted at the Navy Annex. Demolition The building's cornerstone is removed in January 2012 in preparation for its demolition. Wing 2 of the building being demolished in January 2013 A 1998 Congressional proposal to expand Arlington National Cemetery onto land that the Navy Annex and Fort Myer then occupied led to concerns that Arlington County officials had not been properly consulted, leading to the withdrawal of the proposal. However, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65), which was enacted into law during October 1999, subsequently required the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Secretary of the Army administrative jurisdiction of the Navy Annex property. The Act required the Secretary of Defense to demolish the Annex's buildings and prepare the property for use as part of the Cemetery, while requiring the Secretary of the Army to incorporate the Annex property into the Cemetery. The easternmost of the eight wings was demolished in 2004 to make space for the United States Air Force Memorial. The Air Force Memorial was originally planned to be in Arlington National Cemetery near the Marine Corps War Memorial, but concerns about it being intrusive at that location led it to be moved. The building was used as temporary space for offices dislocated by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process, as well as the ongoing Pentagon Renovation Program. This caused the building's life to be extended to 2011. Occupants refused to vacate the premises by the date set by the demolition program manager, causing him to cut off food service and remove the ATM to get them to leave. For the year after the building was emptied, it was used for training exercises for law enforcement officials including SWAT teams, some of which included paintball, K9 training and controlled explosions. Demolition began in 2012. According to the demolition contractor, 90% of the materials resulting from the demolition would be recycled, such as crushed concrete that can be used for constructing new buildings in the Washington, DC area. After the demolition was completed, 12 feet of dirt would be replaced to return the area to green space suitable for grave sites. Most of the land would be used as up to 30,000 grave sites for Arlington National Cemetery. There were also plans for an African-American history museum commemorating the Civil War-era Freedman's Village, which was immediately adjacent to the site. There would also be a realignment of Columbia Pike. Arlington National Cemetery expansion In January 2013, the County Manager of Arlington County, Virginia, and the Executive Director of the Army National Military Cemeteries (consisting of Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Arlington County Board and the Department of the Army to expand the Cemetery even further. Under the tentative plan, Arlington County would give up the easement for Southgate Road (which lies between the Navy Annex property and the cemetery's 2012 boundary), and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the Navy Annex site for a new Southgate Road. In exchange, the Department of Defense would give the Navy Annex parking lot to the county. The Army would also transfer to Arlington County land west of South Joyce Street to Columbia Pike. Additionally, the Commonwealth of Virginia would convey to the Cemetery roughly the northern half of the Virginia Department of Transportation land bounded by South Joyce Street, Columbia Pike, and South Washington Boulevard. The cloverleaf interchange between Columbia Pike and S. Washington Blvd. would be eliminated, and the hairpin turn in Columbia Pike straightened, to provide a safer, more natural exit from S. Washington Blvd. onto Columbia Pike. Although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon state cooperation, the MOU if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery.(1) (2) However, in December 2016, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328) authorized the Secretary of the Army to expand the Cemetery by acquiring from Arlington County and the Commonwealth of Virginia by condemnation and other means properties near the Cemetery that contain the Southgate Road, South Joyce Street and Washington Boulevard right- of-ways, including the Washington Boulevard-Columbia Pike interchange. The Army then informed the Arlington County government in June 2017 that the Army would no longer pursue a land exchange with the County. The Army told the County that the Army would use the entire Navy Annex site to expand the Cemetery and would acquire for the Cemetery about of public land that Arlington County then owned. The Army would also acquire for the Cemetery expansion about of land located between Columbia Pike and Interstate 395 that the Commonwealth of Virginia then owned.(1) (2) (3) Tenant commands *Headquarters, US Marine Corps *Bureau of Personnel, US Navy *Chief of Chaplains, US Navy *Missile Defense Agency References Category:Closed installations of the United States Navy Category:Arlington National Cemetery Category:Military installations in Virginia Category:The Pentagon Category:Office buildings completed in 1941 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2013 ","title":"Navy Annex"},{"id":"43138081","title":"Listed buildings in Greve Municipality"},{"id":"43138110","title":"Comforter (song)"},{"id":"43138122","text":"Donald B.

Fullerton, a Wall Street Broker and country gentleman, and was a member of the Princeton University Class of 1913. At Princeton, Dr. Fullerton served as a counsellor for the Princeton Summer Camp, which served boys from poor neighborhoods in Princeton, Philadelphia, and New York City. The camp was funded by the Philadelphian Society, an evangelical society on campus whose later demise led to the founding of the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship. Fullerton was also a member of the English Dramatic Association, starring as Adriana in Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors and receiving accolades as Abigail in Marlowe's The Jew of Malta. As Princeton was an all-male college at the time the female parts were played, in true Elizabethan fashion, by men. The review in the Daily Princetonian wrote: > The audience did not allow anything humorous to escape it; and once in a > while it fairly howled over lines such as the one which announced that > Abigail, quite mature as played by Fullerton, was but fourteen years of age. > However, the performance was by no means marred by such unexpected > outbursts, and after the first few minutes of the performance the audience > even took Abigail seriously. Fullerton, in this pathetic role of the > unfortunate heroine, had one of the most difficult parts to play, and he not > only kept it from appearing ridiculous to his fellow students, which is in > itself a feat, but he also played it well. =World War One= Donald Fullerton in WWI After the entry of the United States into the First World War, Dr. Fullerton trained with a number of other Princeton alumni at Fort Myer. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 313th Field Artillery whose six batteries were equipped with the famous French 75s. The unit participated in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive during which it was engaged in combat without rest or relief for 47 days and suffered 164 casualties, more than 11% of its soldiers. While serving with Battery A, three of Fullerton's men were killed on 14 October 1918 near Nantillois when a German shell hit their gun. While serving with Battery E two of his men were killed on 1 November 1918 by shell fragments in the fight near the Grande Carr√©e Ferme, north of Bantheville. On 11 November 1918, the unit's last day in combat and the day of the Armistice, Fullerton intrigued to procure sufficient hay for the 313th Artillery's horses from a recalcitrant infantry officer: > It was on the 11th that we paid our first visit to Ferme Boulaine. Some one > had discovered there a barn full of hay, and as our horse were short of > forage we began to carry it over, but presently an infantry officer who had > two horses stabled there placed a guard over it and refused to let us have > it. We never found out exactly what his reason was, for surely there was hay > enough for all of us, but when E Battery encountered the difficulty > Lieutenant Fullerton solved it for the time being by arranging with the > infantry officer to let each of his drivers carry over an arm load of hay. > The infantry officer thoughtlessly forgot to ascertain how many drivers E > Battery had or how they might be identified and as a result we drew all the > hay we needed. After the Armistice, he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant. Shortly after the war Fullerton wrote a chapter for the official history of his unit. He described the consequences of the campaign to the Meuse valley: > Small piles of stones were all that remained of what had been quaint stone > villages in 1914. For miles, hills and valleys presented a continuous > kaleidoscope of shell craters, trenches, dugouts and barbed wire > entanglements. All canal locks and bridges were blown up. Rows of tree > stumps lined the roads and canals where wonderful avenues had either been > chopped away to open fields of fire or shot down by heavy artillery, leaving > a mass of twisted splinters pointing in every direction. He also wrote of the purpose of writing the history of the unit: > It may also give a faint idea of what we accomplished to those who were not > so fortunate as we and who wonder why some of us don't talk. For their > benefit be it said that there is a certain sanctity about a battlefield. > Then, too, a soldier holds dear certain accomplishments but naturally is > backward about mentioning them. There are other morbid memories he would > like to forget and he does not like to prolong their existence in his own > mind or start them in the minds of others. =Missionary work= In 1926 Fullerton decided to pursue missionary work, intending to go to the Belgian Congo, and trained at the Missionary Training Colony in London. Ultimately he went as a missionary with the Plymouth Brethren to the north west frontier of British India but was forced to return to the United States due to poor health. Leading the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship =Founding PEF= P-Rade (date uncertain, likely late 1970s). Dr. Fullerton attempted to return to the mission field in 1929 despite his health troubles, sailing out on the RMS Mauretania. Before the ship sailed he prayed that the ship would be turned around if it was not God's will that he return to India. The Mauretania collided with a car float while still in New York harbor and the ship was forced to return to port. Fullerton disembarked, never to return overseas, and spent a short time teaching at J. Oliver Buswell's National Bible Institute in New York. In 1930 the Philadelphian Society, which had served as the focus of evangelical student life at Princeton University since 1825, went defunct amid the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy. In 1931 the parent of a Princeton student, worried over the lack of evangelical ministry at the university, called Dr. Fullerton to ask him to start Bible classes with students, classes he would continue into the 1970s. In 1937 the Bible classes led by Dr. Fullerton developed into a formal student organization, the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship. The first undergraduate president of the PEF, Archibald Fletcher of the Princeton Class of 1938, wrote to The Daily Princetonian that: > The purpose of this Fellowship shall be to provide an opportunity for > students at Princeton University to enjoy Christian fellowship one with > another, to bear united witness to the faith of its members in the whole > Bible as the inspired Word of God and to encourage other students to take, > with them, a definite stand for Christ on the Campus. =Ministry years= The PEF in 1960 (L-R): William Bryant '60, Chi-Yu King '61, Steve Johnson '60, Don Youngren '61, Ron Fisher '60, Hank Bryant '63, John Frame '61, Jim Renick '60, Suthy MacLean '58, Ken Petzinger '63, Bob Shade '60, Ron Furst '63, Bruce Higgins '60, Bart Campbell '62, Jerry Butler '60. Six became missionaries and one a theologian. Dr. Fullerton moved to Princeton in 1953 to fully devote himself to the work of the PEF. Prior to that time he served in other ministry contexts, including teaching Bible classes to medical students in New York City and serving as the associate pastor of the West End Chapel in Plainfield. After the founding of Westerly Road Church. in 1956 Fullerton became a member and began a long relationship between the church and the PEF. John Frame, a noted Presbyterian theologian, has written at length of the influence of the PEF, Westerly Road Church, and especially Dr. Fullerton on his life through his time at Princeton in the late '50s and early '60s. He writes of Fullerton: > Dr. Fullerton was constantly about his Father's business. When he met a new > student, it usually did not take more than thirty seconds for him to get on > the subject of Jesus and the gospel. Then Fullerton would talk with the > student as long as possible and necessary, to discern his spiritual > condition, to present the gospel, to answer questions, to urge a decision. > When we students sought to lead others to Christ, our main strategy was > usually to maneuver them into a situation where they could have a good talk > with Dr. Fullerton. Not every student who talked with him was converted, but > many were. It seemed to us that, humanly speaking, if anyone could get the > gospel through to a Princeton student, it was Dr. Fullerton... the greatest > part of [PEF] was the godly example of Donald B. Fullerton. He was not a > perfect man, but I am yet today an imitator of his, since he imitated Jesus. =Retirement= Dr. Fullerton continued teaching Bible classes until 1975 and attended prayer meetings with the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship through 1980. He died at the age of 92 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and is buried in the Princeton Cemetery. Philippians 3:10 is referenced on his gravestone: \\"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.\\" His legacy continues through the work of the Princeton Christian Fellowship.

The Coast Survey acquired Benjamin Peirce in 1855 and placed her in service along the United States East Coast, where she spent her entire Coast Survey career. She was named for the preeminent American mathematician of the nineteenth century, Benjamin Peirce, who was a friend of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, Alexander Dallas Bache, and succeeded Bache as Superintendent in 1867.NOAA History, A Science Odyssey: Tools of the Trade: Ships: Coast and Geodetic Survey Ships: Benjamin Peirce On the evening of 5 January 1856, Benjamin Peirce was anchored in the St. Johns River off Jacksonville, Florida, when the steamer SS Seminole caught fire at a pier upstream shortly before midnight. Burning from stem to stern, Seminole was cut loose from her moorings so that the flames would not spread to buildings ashore and began to drift down onto Benjamin Peirce. By the time the senior officer aboard Benjamin Peirce, Sailing Master P. R. Hawley, could get her crew on deck, Seminole was only 50 yards (46 meters) away. Leaving half of Benjamin Peirces men aboard with buckets and axes to prevent flames from spreading to her if Seminole drifted onto her, Hawley took the rest of the men out in a boat to attempt to tow Seminole away from Benjamin Peirce. The boat managed to pull Seminole far enough for her only to strike a glancing blow against Benjamin Peirce, although Seminole passed the survey schooner so closely that the intense heat of the fire destroyed Benjamin Peirces foresail, mainsail, main gaff-top-sail, starboard main shrouds and main topmast back- stay and some of her running rigging. The flames also charred most of Benjamin Peirces spars, both of her masts, her starboard bulwarks, her galley, her cabin quarter-house, and her deck, damaged a new boat lying on her deck, and broke the glass in the skylight of her cabin quarter-house. Her main boom fell when the topping lift which supported it was destroyed, and it crushed her taffrail when it fell. Despite this damage, Hawleys quick action had prevented Seminole from becoming entangled with Benjamin Peirce, which probably would have resulted in the destruction of Benjamin Peirce.Theberge, Captain Albert E., The Coast Survey 1807-1867: Volume I of the History of the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \\"LIFE IN THE FIELD: THE FIRE SHIP,\\" no publisher listed, NOAA History, 1998. With the flames that spread to Benjamin Peirce put out by her crew, Hawley saw that Seminole next would threaten the brig Iza anchored downstream from Benjamin Peirce with a full cargo. Hawley continued to tow Seminole so that she would clear Iza, then went aboard Iza and was given command by the Izas captain. Hawley and other men from Benjamin Pierce were instrumental in saving Iza and her cargo from burning. The Coast Survey decommissioned Benjamin Peirce in 1868.

The pair were believed to have been seen together at a truck stop in Missouri, which is where the murders took place. Kim was found in Mississippi County, Arkansas and Jimmy was left at the presumed murder scene. Jimmy was identified in May 2017; Kim's ID was confirmed in late 2017 and her identity was released publicly in early February 2018. Neither had been reported missing. Both were from Michigan.Carl Koppelman Case A white male and female were discovered on June 17, 1978 in Pemiscot County, Missouri and Blytheville, Mississippi County, Arkansas, respectively. Although they were found 15 miles from each other, they were likely murdered by the same person, as the pair were reportedly seen together before the murders at a truck stop in the same town and were believed to have been dropped off by a man. They are presumed to have been killed by the same individual or individuals. Due to flooding, their case files were damaged, including the loss of their fingerprint records, although their dental charts and DNA information remain intact. In September 2017, both victims were identified. =Victims= The male victim's age range was between 25 and his early 30s. This would place his birth between c. 1948 and 1953. He was discovered in Pemiscot County, Missouri, where it is believed the murders took place. He had blue eyes, brown hair and a light complexion with freckles. This victim had a tattoo on his right arm, which consisted of the letters \\"J\\" and \\"H.\\" He was estimated to be five feet eight inches tall and at a weight of 130 to 140 pounds. He had a distinctive vertical scar on his forehead, the cause of which is unknown. He wore a red shirt containing a graphic of a woman enclosed inside of a circle, with the words \\"hot sauce\\" underneath. Other clothing included size nine or ten boots, and blue jeans. Some of his teeth were reported to have been missing. Unlike his companion, who was shot once, he had suffered three to his neck and head. The woman was between 18 and 25, although she could have been as old as 35. This would place her birth between c. 1943 and 1960. Her hair was naturally brown, but was likely dyed blond, as its color was darker toward the roots. The word \\"Kim\\" was amateurishly tattooed on her right arm, which could possibly have been her own or her child's name, as her autopsy concluded that she had borne at least one child. Some of her teeth had yet to erupt. She was shot once in the head with a shotgun. Her possessions included a mercury dime necklace and a multicolored striped shirt and jeans. Identification Hendricks's identity was confirmed first, in May 2017. His DNA was matched to his sister, June. Additionally, fingerprints from the victim were linked to those taken by the Michigan Department of Corrections; Hendricks had served a prison term in Michigan for an unspecified offense. After his relatives were contacted by police with questions about his female companion, they informed the investigators of his girlfriend at the time. Mills' brother's DNA was later obtained and was matched to her remains. The couple had not been reported missing due to the belief that they left Michigan due to Hendricks's parole agreement. The pair had planned to leave for Texas and return home after seven years, according to Hendricks' sister.

Perelman Performing Arts Center at the World Trade Center (PACWTC), also called the Performing Arts Center, is a multi-space performing arts center under construction at the northeast corner of the World Trade Center complex in Manhattan, New York City. The Performing Arts Center is located at the intersection of Vesey, Fulton, and Greenwich Streets in Lower Manhattan. The building is named for billionaire Ronald Perelman, who donated $75 million to its construction. Plans for the Performing Arts Center were first announced by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) in 2004 as part of the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site after the September 11 attacks. Gehry Partners LLP and Sn√∏hetta were selected as the original designers, but plans were reportedly stalled over financing and design, as well as the presence of the temporary entrance to the PATH train's World Trade Center station on the site. The original design was scrapped by September 2014, and Joshua Prince-Ramus and Davis Brody Bond were selected as architects the next year. After further financing issues were resolved and the PATH station entrance was relocated, below-ground construction began in August 2017, followed by the construction of the above-ground frame in 2020. It is scheduled to be completed in 2021. When completed, the Performing Arts Center will include approximately across three floors. Original design Original Gehry model The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) announced on October 12, 2004, that Gehry Partners LLP and Sn√∏hetta, an architectural firm from Norway, would design the Performing Arts Center. Gehry's proposal, which incorporated a boxlike design, would have housed the Joyce Theater, as the Signature Theater Company had dropped out due to space constraints and cost limitations. Plans for the construction of the Performing Arts Center were reportedly stalled over financing and design, although construction was also hindered by the presence of the entrance to the PATH train's temporary World Trade Center station within its footprint. In February 2014, David Lan, Artistic Director of London's Young Vic Theatre, was announced as Consulting Artistic Director of the PACWTC, a position he will hold simultaneously with his Young Vic leadership. The venue's mission was revised to originate works of theater, music, and dance in three small flexible theaters. Redesign PACWTC current basic design, as of 2015 By September 2014, Gehry Associates were no longer connected with the project. Plans were proceeding for the choice of a new architect and future programming for a 2019 opening. Gehry's design was scrapped; the board of the Performing Arts Center planned to choose a new design from one of three other architects. This change came after Maggie Boepple, the president of the Performing Arts Center appointed in 2012, was said to have disapproved of Gehry's work. In July 2015, it was reported that the construction budget for the Performing Arts Center was to be reduced from $350 million to $200 million. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) announced at a board meeting that the $99 million in federal funds committed to the project was contingent on the arts center's leaders‚Äô \\"producing an affordable design and a viable plan for raising the remaining money from private sources.\\" In November 2015, the Performing Arts Center announced that they had awarded the design architect contract to Joshua Prince-Ramus of Rex Architecture P.C., with the firm Davis Brody Bond to serve as executive architect. On March 3, 2016, the permanent PATH station building opened one block to the south, and the temporary entrance was closed. The opening of the new station building allowed the temporary station entrance to be demolished in August of that year. This, in turn, allowed the construction of the Performing Arts Center on the site. On June 29, 2016, billionaire Ronald Perelman donated $75 million to the construction and endowment of the Performing Arts Center at the World Trade Center. Because of his contribution to the facility, the center was renamed after him. In September 2016, Barbra Streisand was named the Center's Chairwoman of the board. The concept art for the new building was revealed that month, with mostly positive reviews from architecture critics. On March 27, 2017, it was announced that construction would be delayed due to ongoing disputes between the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) and the Port Authority regarding funding for the project.  Construction  The Performing Arts Center from the North Pool on September 11, 2020 Construction began in August 2017 on its below-grade parking garage, which will be accessible from the rear of the building on Vesey Street. Work on the building itself was originally expected to begin in 2018, with an estimated 2020 completion date and opening. The Port Authority gave the Performing Arts Center a 99-year lease in February 2018. The first pieces of structural steel arrived that April. Work was halted in early 2018 due to financial disagreements between the Port Authority and LMDC, but routine steel work and concrete pouring resumed shortly thereafter. The Performing Arts Center received $89 million from the LMDC and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in December 2018. Underground work was completed in July 2019, and steel construction began later that year. The building topped out on September 11, 2020. , the Performing Arts Center was scheduled to open in 2021.  Design  When completed, the Performing Arts Center will include approximately across three floors. The public floor will be located at street level, and will house a restaurant/bar to provide refreshments during show intermissions. The second floor will consist of rehearsal and dressing rooms for theater actors, and the third floor will house three theaters. All three theaters are designed so that the walls will be able to rotate and expand to provide extra space for a single theater if needed. The theaters will occupy approximately 1,200 people combined.

Mixcoac consists of the colonias (official neighborhoods) of Nonoalco, San Juan, Extremadura Insurgentes, Mixcoac, and Insurgentes Mixcoac and is part of the borough of Benito Ju√°rez. It is bounded by Avenida de los Insurgentes to the east and the Perif√©rico freeway to the west, south of Colonia N√°poles and San Pedro de los Pinos. It is a designated Barrio M√°gico (\\"magical neighborhood\\") of Mexico City.\\"Mixcoac\\", Barrios M√°gicos, Mexico City Tourism Secretariat  History  Archaeological site of Mixcoac The name \\"Mixcoac\\" comes from the Nahuatl language mixtli (cloud), coatl (serpent), c√≥mo (in), and means \\"Place of the Cloud Serpent\\", alluding to the Milky Way and the god Mixc√≥atl. Before the Spanish conquest there was a small settlement on the edge of Lake Texcoco, the lake that surrounded the island city of Tenochtitlan, today Mexico City. The ruins of the settlement, occupied between about 900 AD and 1521 AD, can be seen at the Mixcoac archeological site. After the Conquest, ranchos and haciendas were established in the area, as well as a textile factory which is today forms part of the Mexico City campus of the Universidad Panamericana. In the late 19th century, wealthy people from Mexico City began establishing summer residences here and in nearby towns such as Tacubaya, San √Ångel and Coyoac√°n. In 1910 the large La Casta√±eda psychiatric hospital opened, functioning until 1967. In 1928 the Municipality of Mixcoac was absorbed into Mexico City proper, becoming part of a new Departamento Central within the Mexican Federal District.\\"Programa Parcial de Desarrollo Urbano de Insurgentes Mixcoac\\", Daily Record of the Assembly, Year 3, No. 50, Annex 1, Mexican Federal District Legislative Assembly In 1910 the municipality had 21,812 residents with about 1900 dwellings. In the following decades the ranchos and haciendas were subdivided and the area became contiguous with the rest of the Mexico City urban area. Nonetheless the historic center of Mixcoac around the main square is largely intact. Points of interest Historic buildings and sites that still exist include: * Glorieta de Goya roundabout and park with a statue of √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n * Old textile factory (Antiguo Obraje de Mixcoac) - Universidad Panamericana: previously a silk clothing factory and now part of the university * Centro Cultural Juan Rulfo: former city hall built under President Porfirio D√≠az, now a cultural center * Casa de la Campana (\\"House of the Bell\\") * Plaza Jaur√©gui: Main square * House of Joaqu√≠n Fern√°ndez de Lizardi * Galer√≠a Arte Quimera Churches include the Parroquia de Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n (a.k.a.

Awarded, with his co-authors, the 2014 Donald Smiley Prize by the Canadian Political Science Association, for Public Budgeting in the Age of Crises: Canada‚Äôs Shifting Budgetary Domains and Temporal Budgeting, as the best book published in English or French in the field relating to the study of government and politics in Canada in the previous year.  Notable ideas  Often in collaborations, Prince has made substantive contributions to understanding, in the Canadian context, expenditure and revenue budgeting by governments; disability politics and policy; instruments of governing, including regulation and the regulatory state; and the history and contemporary state of social policy. He has elaborated on the concept of stealth as a reform process and articulated a political theory of universality in relation to income security, health care and social services. Among the concepts he has developed are Aristotle‚Äôs benchmarks, blue rinse politics, civic regulation, d√©j√† vu discourse, directed incrementalism, fiscalization of social policy, gently coercive governing, the Hobbesian prime minister, regulatory welfarism, and supply side social policy. With respect to intergovernmental relations or multi-level governance, Prince has theorized notions of actuarial federalism, deliberative federalism, provincial spending power and sociopolitical province building and, for Aboriginal peoples and their political organizations, the hide-and-seek politics of federalism. With respect to critical disability studies, Prince has elaborated the concepts of disability governance and normalcy/disability relations.

He is part Cherokee on his mother's side and his grandparents instilled a deep interest in Native American culture. At age 19, he began his map-making research and as of 2014, he has made maps of indigenous tribes with their original names for the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico. Biography Carapella is from Warner, Oklahoma. He told NPR that he is \\"mixed-blood Cherokee\\" on his mother's side and lives in a ranch house in the Cherokee Nation. He also speaks Cherokee and Spanish, and has a bachelor's degree in marketing from Indiana Institute of Technology. His grandparents on his mother's side, instilled in him a deep interest in Native Americans: When he was a teenager, he wanted to find a map of the United States that depicted all of the Native American tribes on it. He went to numerous powwows, but he could never find a map that depicted all of the tribes. Instead, he typically found maps that depicted 50 to 100 tribes. He told Rick Smith writing for Win Awenen Nisitotung that When he was younger, he described himself as a \\"radical youngster\\" who was involved in Native American causes and protested Columbus Day. He is a member of the American Indian Movement. Now, he focuses on map making as \\"a way to convey the truth in a different way\\". Map making He constructs maps of Native American tribal lands with their original names prior to Europeans coming to the Americas. His motivation for making maps stems from his childhood, but he began research and construction of maps at the age of 19 and, as of 2014, he has worked on them for more than 14 years. His aim has been to construct Pre-Columbian era maps circa 1490, just before Columbus landed in the Americas. Part of his inspiration for constructing maps with the original tribal names came from a book he read that explained some of the original tribal names and what they meant. To accomplish his goal, he began reading books, going to library archives and then calling up tribal members and visiting reservations to rediscover original tribal names and where they were located. His research and map construction began as four \\"pencil-marked poster boards on his bedroom wall\\". Some of the tribes he contacted did not initially know the information he needed, but someone from the tribe would always get back to him with the information he needed to continue his research and map building. For example, he often would call a tribe to ask for their original name and they would reply that they did not know what they had called themselves. They would then ask an elder of the tribe and discover the name. In another case, Carapella did not know what name of the Waileptu or Cayuse people meant and he could not find it with Internet searches or in any books, but one of the last speakers of their language was able to tell him what it meant. He found the Handbook of North American Indians to be very helpful in constructing his maps. He cross-referenced the book with other sources such as missionary records and army records to determine where a European trader reported that he met a particular tribe. This allowed him to narrow down the locations of tribes to approximately 1490. He then would verify his findings by contacting tribes to verify the spelling of the original tribal names and their tribal locations. Carapella told the Navajo Times that the biggest challenge in constructing these maps was finding all of the original names. He found research on his maps especially difficult because some tribes had only a few surviving members and even fewer speakers of their native language. Other small tribes had disappeared and the only information left was in the tribes that had absorbed them. He believes that his research shows that while some tribal names have gone extinct, the decedents of these tribes were assimilated into other larger tribes. That is, when a tribe was driven out of an area it inhabited area, the survivors were usually assimilated into a larger tribe: \\"If you're a member of the Creek tribe, for example, you probably have the blood of 15 to 20 former tribal nations\\". Carapella observed that the tendency for tribes to maintain their original name often depended on whether they still lived near their original homeland. He has speculated that In 2012, he contacted the United States Copyright Office to have them do a search on whether his concept of a map had been copyrighted before. When they reported back that no such maps had been copyrighted, he put all his efforts into getting the first map drawn and he copyrighted it when he completed it. Maps As of 2014, he has completed maps of the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico. The first map of the United States was released in November, 2012, and according to Two Row Times it was the first to show North American indigenous nations in their original languages. According to senior geographer at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C., Doug Herman, his maps are unique because they include both the original name of Native American tribes and the names they are commonly known by. According to Herman Herman also noted that some of the common names for Native American tribes are derogatory. Sometimes one tribe described another tribe with a derogatory term in their language and it stuck as the common name for that tribe. For example, the word \\"Comanche\\" is a word in the Ute language that means in English \\"anyone who wants to fight me all the time\\". Herman told NPR For example, instead of finding \\"Comanche\\" on the map there is \\"Numinu\\" and instead of \\"Navajo\\" there is \\"Din√©\\" (though he also makes maps with the original name on top and the current name below such as \\"Din√©\\" above and \\"Navajo\\" below.) Maps today of Native American lands depict small trust lands and reservations surrounded by vast amounts of lands that were ceded away by treaties or forcibly taken over the years. Carapella's maps show that before 1492, North America was filled with a large number of autonomous tribes. He also wanted his maps to indicate both the size of the tribal populations and the regions they inhabited. The maps were developed with the help of Overdrive Media and Printing in Flagstaff, Arizona. His maps have photographs or illustrations of individuals, artifacts, dwellings, and clothing that are appropriate to the tribe and are placed in the appropriate locations for each tribe. The map of the continental United States that he constructed has approximately 590 tribal nations with original tribal names. Of these tribes, approximately 150 are extinct. Because most of the tribes were nomadic, he placed the names of the tribes in locations where the tribes were before they were pushed out by European expansion. He varies the font size of the names of tribes to indicate their relative population size and land area they inhabited. In addition, about 150 tribes have their current name listed under their original name because many people do not know the original name that these tribes used to be called. Carapella had not planned on making a Canadian map. He had encouraged another person in Canada to make map similar to his United States map, but that did not work out, so he went ahead and made a Canadian map. The Canadian map identifies 212 tribes by their original names. There were many autonomous groups that he could not include because there was not enough room on the map to include the smallest groups. As with the United States map in which he has made many revisions, he expects to continue making revisions in his maps as new information comes in. Today's borders between Canada and the United States and Mexico and the United States are arbitrary with respect to where tribal areas used to be. For example, he estimates that there are about 24 tribes that have populations split by the Mexico-United States border. In constructing his map of Mexico, he noticed that the language and culture of tribes in Mexico are better preserved than the same tribes on the United States side of the border. He speculates that the reason may be that there was a greater effort by the American government to relocate children into American Indian boarding schools. By early 2015, Carapella had completed a map of Alaska and subsequently created a map of all the Indian tribes in North America without borders, which identifies over 1000 tribes. By late 2015, Carapella had completed a borderless map of tribes of South America. In the future, he also would like to make an \\"old-fashioned driving atlas\\" in which he can focus on different areas in much more detail.

It is a scheme for power extraction from nuclear fusion. A basic direct converter  History and theoretical underpinnings  = Electrostatic direct collectors = In the middle of the 1960s direct energy conversion was proposed as a method for capturing the energy from the exhaust gas in a fusion reactor. This would generate a direct current of electricity. Richard F. Post at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was an early proponent of the idea. Post reasoned that capturing the energy would require five steps: (1) Ordering the charged particles into linear beam. (2) Separation of positives and negatives. (3) Separating the ions into groups, by their energy. (4) Gathering these ions as they touch collectors. (5) Using these collectors as the positive side in a circuit. Post argued that the efficiency was theoretically determined by the number of collectors. The Venetian blind Designs in the early 1970s by William Barr and Ralph Moir used metal ribbons at an angle to collect these ions. This was called the Venetian Blind design, because the ribbons look like window blinds. Those metal ribbon-like surfaces are more transparent to ions going forward than to ions going backward. Ions pass through surfaces of successively increasing potential until they turn and start back, along a parabolic trajectory. They then see opaque surfaces and are caught. Thus ions are sorted by energy with high-energy ions being caught on high-potential electrodes. William Barr and Ralph Moir then ran a group which did a series of direct energy conversion experiments through the late 1970s and early 1980s.Morris, Jeff. \\"In Memoriam.\\" (n.d.): n. pag. Rpt. in Newsline. 19th ed. Vol. 29. Livermore: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 2004. 2. Print. The first experiments used beams of positives and negatives as fuel, and demonstrated energy capture at a peak efficiency of 65 percent and a minimum efficiency of 50 percent. The following experiments involved a true plasma direct converter that was tested on the Tandem Mirror Experiment (TMX), an operating magnetic mirror fusion reactor. In the experiment, the plasma moved along diverging field lines, spreading it out and converting it into a forward moving beam with a Debye length of a few centimeters. Suppressor grids then reflect the electrons, and collector anodes recovered the ion energy by slowing them down and collecting them at high-potential plates. This machine demonstrated an energy capture efficiency of 48 percent. However, Marshall Rosenbluth argued that keeping the plasma's neutral charge over the very short Debye length distance would be very challenging in practice, though he said that this problem would not occur in every version of this technology. The Venetian Blind converter can operate with 100 to 150 keV D-T plasma, with an efficiency of about 60% under conditions compatible with economics, and an upper technical conversion efficiency up to 70% ignoring economic limitations. Periodic electrostatic focusing A second type of electrostatic converter initially proposed by Post, then developed by Barr and Moir, is the Periodic Electrostatic Focusing concept. Like the Venetian Blind concept, it is also a direct collector, but the collector plates are disposed in many stages along the longitudinal axis of an electrostatic focusing channel. As each ion is decelerated along the channel toward zero energy, the particle becomes \\"over-focused\\" and is deflected sideways from the beam, then collected. The Periodic Electrostatic Focusing converter typically operates with a 600 keV D-T plasma (as low as 400 keV and up to 800 keV) with efficiency of about 60% under conditions compatible with economics, and an upper technical conversion efficiency up to 90% ignoring economic limitations. = Induction systems =  Conduction systems  From the 1960s through the 1970s, methods have been developed to extract electrical energy directly from a hot gas (a plasma) in motion within a channel fitted with electromagnets (producing a transverse magnetic field), and electrodes (connected to load resistors). Charge carriers (free electrons and ions) incoming with the flow are then separated by the Lorentz force and an electric potential difference can be retrieved from pairs of connected electrodes. Shock tubes used as pulsed MHD generators were for example able to produce several megawatts of electricity in channels the size of a beverage can.  Induction systems  In addition to converters using electrodes, pure inductive magnetic converters have also been proposed by Lev Artsimovich in 1963, then Alan Frederic Haught and his team from United Aircraft Research Laboratories in 1970, and Ralph Moir in 1977. The magnetic compression- expansion direct energy converter is analogous to the internal combustion engine. As the hot plasma expands against a magnetic field, in a manner similar to hot gases expanding against a piston, part of the energy of the internal plasma is inductively converted to an electromagnetic coil, as an EMF (voltage) in the conductor. This scheme is best used with pulsed devices, because the converter then works like a \\"magnetic four-stroke engine\\": # Compression: A column of plasma is compressed by a magnetic field that acts like a piston. # Thermonuclear burn: The compression heats the plasma to the thermonuclear ignition temperature. # Expansion/Power: The expansion of fusion reaction products (charged particles) increases the plasma pressure and pushes the magnetic field outward. A voltage is induced and collected in the electromagnetic coil. # Exhaust/Refuel: After expansion, the partially burned fuel is flushed out, and new fuel in the form of gas is introduced and ionized; and the cycle starts again. In 1973, a team from Los Alamos and Argonne laboratories stated that the thermodynamic efficiency of the magnetic direct conversion cycle from alpha-particle energy to work is 62%. = Traveling-wave direct energy converter = In 1992, a Japan‚ÄìU.S. joint-team proposed a novel direct energy conversion system for 14.7 MeV protons produced by D-3He fusion reactions, whose energy is too high for electrostatic converters. The conversion is based on a Traveling-Wave Direct Energy Converter (TWDEC). A gyrotron converter first guides fusion product ions as a beam into a 10-meter long microwave cavity filled with a 10-tesla magnetic field, where 155 MHz microwaves are generated and converted to a high voltage DC output through rectennas. The Field-Reversed Configuration reactor ARTEMIS in this study was designed with an efficiency of 75%. The traveling-wave direct converter has a maximum projected efficiency of 90%. =Inverse cyclotron converter (ICC)= Original direct converters were designed to extract the energy carried by 100 to 800 keV ions produced by D-T fusion reactions. Those electrostatic converters are not suitable for higher energy product ions above 1 MeV generated by other fusion fuels like the D-3He or the p-11B aneutronic fusion reactions. A much shorter device than the Traveling- Wave Direct Energy Converter has been proposed in 1997 and patented by Tri Alpha Energy, Inc. as an Inverse Cyclotron Converter (ICC). The ICC is able to decelerate the incoming ions based on experiments made in 1950 by Felix Bloch and Carson D. Jeffries, in order to extract their kinetic energy. The converter operates at 5 MHz and requires a magnetic field of only 0.6 tesla. The linear motion of fusion product ions is converted to circular motion by a magnetic cusp. Energy is collected from the charged particles as they spiral past quadrupole electrodes. More classical electrostatic collectors would also be used for particles with energy less than 1 MeV. The Inverse Cyclotron Converter has a maximum projected efficiency of 90%. =X-ray photoelectric converter= A significant amount of the energy released by fusion reactions is composed of electromagnetic radiations, essentially X-rays due to Bremsstrahlung. Those X-rays can not be converted into electric power with the various electrostatic and magnetic direct energy converters listed above, and their energy is lost. Whereas more classical thermal conversion has been considered with the use of a radiation/boiler/energy exchanger where the X-ray energy is absorbed by a working fluid at temperatures of several thousand degrees, more recent research done by companies developing nuclear aneutronic fusion reactors, like Lawrenceville Plasma Physics (LPP) with the Dense Plasma Focus, and Tri Alpha Energy, Inc. with the Colliding Beam Fusion Reactor (CBFR), plan to harness the photoelectric and Auger effects to recover energy carried by X-rays and other high-energy photons. Those photoelectric converters are composed of X-ray absorber and electron collector sheets nested concentrically in an onion-like array. Indeed, since X-rays can go through far greater thickness of material than electrons can, many layers are needed to absorb most of the X-rays. LPP announces an overall efficiency of 81% for the photoelectric conversion scheme.  Direct energy conversion from fission products  In the early 2000s, research was undertaken by Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, The University of Florida, Texas A&M; University and General Atomics to use direct conversion to extract energy from fission reactions, essentially, attempting to extract energy from the linear motion of charged particles coming off a fission reaction.

The book was born from a series of articles published between 1913 and 1916 in Danish, and although republished as a book it received mainly criticism from established scientists and got little attention within Denmark. The English edition of 1926, however, became highly influential at the time due to the breadth of evidence synthesized as well as the artwork used to support its arguments.Nieuwland (2004) pp. 1‚Äì11. It was considered the last word on the subject of bird evolution for several decades after its publication.Shipman (1998) p. 110. Through the course of the research represented in the book, Heilmann considers and eventually rejects the possibility of all living and several extinct groups of reptiles as potential ancestors for modern birds, including crocodilians, pterosaurs and several groups of dinosaurs.Weishampel, Dodson & Osm√≥lska (2004) p. 220. Despite his acknowledgment that some of the smaller Jurassic theropods had many similarities to Archaeopteryx and modern birds, he determined that they were unlikely to be direct bird ancestors and that they were instead closely‚Äìrelated offshoots,Ries (2007) pp. 1‚Äì19. and concluded that the similarities were a result of convergent evolution rather than direct ancestry.Alexander & Vogel (2004) p. 197. Based essentially on a process of elimination, Heilmann arrives at the conclusion that birds must be descended from thecodonts, a group of archosaurs that lived during the Permian and Triassic periods. Although this conclusion was later shown to be inaccurate, The Origin of Birds was regarded as a masterful piece of scholarship at the time and set the international agenda for research in bird evolution for nearly half a century, and much of its research remains of interest. Background The first Archaeopteryx specimen When Heilmann began his research in the early 1900s, the early bird Archaeopteryx was only known from three fossils found in the limestone quarries of Solnhofen near Eichst√§tt, Germany. The three fossils consisted of two nearly complete skeletons found in 1861 and 1877 and a single feather from 1860. They had been discovered just a few decades after the discovery of the dinosaurs, and as some dinosaurs appeared somewhat birdlike, Archaeopteryx was regarded as a possible \\"missing link\\" between reptiles and birds by many paleontologists at the time. The similarities between Archaeopteryx, known dinosaurs and extant birds were examined and emphasized, with Thomas Huxley championing the idea that Archaeopteryx as well as modern birds had more in common with theropod dinosaurs than any other group of animals. This was at the time in opposition to the view of anatomist Sir Richard Owen of the British Museum, who viewed Archaeopteryx as no different taxonomically from modern birds. Huxley's work was controversial, and this climate of uncertainty and contention about bird origins persisted well into the beginning of the 20th century.Long (2008) pp. 3‚Äì4. While the dinosaur-bird connection (or lack thereof) was being pursued in paleontology, the problem of the evolution of flight was under scrutiny as well. It was observed that a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, flying lizards and flying squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that the ancestors of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that the ancestors of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the paleontology scene, these two sets of conflicting theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions. Publication Self‚Äìportrait of Gerhard Heilmann from 1912 Between 1913 and 1916, Gerhard Heilmann published a series of articles in the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society, all heavily illustrated and dealing with the question of the origin of birds. He first proposed the idea of a popular treatise on bird evolution in 1912 to Otto Helms, the editor of the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society. Helms supported the idea but recommended that Heilmann first seek professional advice on the topic.Ries (2010) pp. 69‚Äì91. Despite the lack of formal training in zoology, Heilmann succeeded in amassing his research with the help of several others, including the expert in prehistoric animals at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, Adolf Herluf Winge, and the biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson of the University of Dundee. Winge, though initially showing interest in Heilmann's work, later proved to be a source of frustration by refusing to engage Heilmann in depth on various scientific queries. Heilmann eventually broke off contact, expressing some bitterness at the apparent change of heart, which Heilmann later ascribed to Winge's belief in Lamarckism. Heilmann's original articles were publicly ignored by Danish zoologists, but caused considerable unrest behind the scenes. Danish zoologist R.H. Stamm, for example, mocked Heilmann in private letters to Helms shortly after the publication of his first article. Other Danish zoologists openly expressed their disdain for Heilmann's work as well, including the professors of zoology in Copenhagen University J.E.V. Boas and Hector Jungersen. Despite this, Helms continued to steadfastly support Heilmann and his ideas, which eventually began to gain attention from abroad. In April 1913, the American expert in fossil birds R. W. Shufeldt came across Heilmann's first article by chance. Shufeldt, who was married to a Norwegian, could understand some Danish and was able to interpret Heilmann's work and initiated contact with him shortly thereafter. This opened up the opportunity for international correspondence with distinguished paleontologists for Heilmann, which was instrumental to the recognition of his work outside of Denmark. Heilmann's articles were later collected and published as a book in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming (\\"our present knowledge about the origin of birds\\").Salomonsen (1946) pp. 146‚Äì149. This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France. Consequently, and at the urging of Shufeldt, Heilmann devoted much of the next few years attempting to find an English‚Äìlanguage publisher willing to undertake a translation of his work. None of the larger publishers he approached were willing to do so unless Heilmann himself was prepared to finance it, which he was unable to do. In the meantime, Heilmann took the opportunity to revise and improve his manuscript, which included information he acquired from examining the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx for the first time in 1923 at the invitation of Josef Felix Pompeckj, a professor at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Examining this important specimen in person allowed Heilmann to add some additional details and revisions to his understanding of the hip, the skull, and the flight feathers. With the help of the English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum, he finally met success in finding a small London publisher willing to produce an English version of his manuscript in 1926. =Editions= While most of the original material was published in the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society between the years of 1913 and 1916, the first English version of the book was published in London in 1926 by H. F. & G. Witherby. It was published in the United States the following year by D. Appleton & Company. The book was reprinted in 1972 by Dover Publications, Inc.,Worldcat.org with the only change being the grayscale reproduction of several illustrations originally published in color.Heilmann (1926) The English and Danish editions differed in several significant ways. The English edition was somewhat shorter and more concise, and included newer information that Heilmann had acquired by studying the actual fossils of Archaeopteryx in Berlin, as well as from foreign scientists who sent him photographs and plaster casts. It also contained considerably less harsh language towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition did not contain the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the use of his methods in reconstructing his Proavis. Book outline Heilmann's book was divided into four main parts. The first three draw evidence for bird evolution from the fossil record, from the embryos of birds and other animals, and from living birds, respectively. The fourth and most groundbreaking section examines several groups of extinct animals in order to determine the probable root of modern birds. =Part I: Some Fossil Birds= In the first section, Heilmann examines in exquisite detail the fossil remains of several extinct birds, including Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, Archaeopteryx, and \\"Archaeornis\\", the name used commonly at the time for the Berlin specimen, which was then thought to represent a separate genus. Throughout this section are many finely detailed and labeled renderings of different parts of the skeletal anatomy of these birds, as well as other groups of extinct reptiles and some modern birds. Heilmann's attention to detail in his artwork is inspired at least in part by his dissatisfaction with anatomical renderings of these animals in scholarly works of the time, which he deemed as \\"unsatisfactory\\" and \\"containing misleading errors.\\"Heilmann (1926) p. 3. Heilmann's comparative illustration of the skeletal anatomy of Archaeopteryx and a modern pigeon Early in this section Heilmann embarks on a thorough description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus of the time that the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un- birdlike.Heilmann (1926) pp. 5‚Äì9. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryx's anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds,Heilmann (1926) pp. 15‚Äì21. as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles.Heilmann (1926) pp. 22‚Äì23. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.Heilmann (1926) p. 30. He goes on to state that other features of Archaeopteryx, however, are remarkably birdlike and bear little resemblance to their reptilian analogues. The hand of Archaeopteryx is observed as being one of its most remarkable features, having what Heilmann calls a \\"reptilian basis\\" which has come to support primary feathers. He compares this to a primitive five-digit reptile hand, noting the obvious differences, before outlining the striking similarity of the hand to that of the theropod Ornitholestes.Heilmann (1926) pp. 23‚Äì25. Here Heilmann goes into considerable detail about the wing arrangement of Archaeopteryx, drawing from his observation of the Berlin specimen.Heilmann (1926) pp. 26‚Äì32. The latter part of this section deals with analyzing the skeletal anatomy of the fossil birds Hesperornis and Ichthyornis, but Heilmann ultimately decides that they are of no importance to his investigations.Heilmann (1926) pp. 38‚Äì56. He concludes the section by stating that Archaeopteryx \\"may be characterized as a reptile in the disguise of a bird\\", and states that his studies must turn from the skeleton to the soft tissue in order to reach a final conclusion.Heilmann (1926) p. 57. =Part II: Embryonic Stages of Reptiles and Birds= Heilmann's comparative illustrations of the embryos and adults of several extant birds and reptiles In this section, Heilmann draws evidence from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A fair amount of detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals.Heilmann (1926) pp. 61‚Äì63. He then goes on to offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal.Heilmann (1926) pp. 64‚Äì65. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds. He examines in detail the expression of evolutionary stages in the development of embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.Heilmann (1926) pp. 61‚Äì94. =Part III: Some Anatomical and Biological Data= Part III deals with anatomical comparisons between extant birds and reptiles, wherein Heilmann finds traces of the relationship between them in examples of fenestrae, claws, the brain, sense organs, sexual organs, and other features. He concludes that many of these features are \\"nearly identical\\" between reptiles and birds. He cites other features as being clearly derived from one another, such as the avian feather essentially being a cylindrical, fringed scale.Heilmann (1926) pp. 97‚Äì132. Heilmann's comparative illustrations of the feet and scale shields of various extant birds and reptiles He begins the section with an analysis of the temporal opening found in the skull of many extant birds. After a thorough comparison, he rejects the notion, which was common at the time, that this temporal opening was homologous with the supratemporal fenestra in reptiles. Instead, he concludes that it is a recent feature.Heilmann (1926) pp. 97‚Äì100. Next he makes some observations on the wing structure of modern nestling birds. He finds that some species of extant birds have claws on their first and second fingers when very young, and some, like the hoatzin, will even use these temporary claws to climb about, including in the branches of trees. He also discovers that far more nestlings have a nonfunctional claw on the first digit, and some adult birds do as well.Heilmann (1926) pp. 100‚Äì105. Organs are next examined in detail, with various comparisons drawn between reptiles and birds. He starts with the brain, analyzing in detail the cerebral and cerebellar structure of several animals including birds, crocodilians, and mammals. Though noticeably more developed, Heilmann finds that the general structure of the brain is very similar in birds and reptiles, and he describes the brain of modern birds as \\"further evolution of the peculiar characters already found in the reptile.\\"Heilmann (1926) pp. 105‚Äì109. He also finds the eyes of birds and reptiles to be remarkably similar, especially the development of the lens, as well as the ear, which reveals a much wider gap between the Sauropsida and mammals than with birds.Heilmann (1926) pp. 110‚Äì114. He describes the sexual organs of birds and reptiles to likewise be structurally similar, and finds that while most species of male bird have lost the penis to reduce weight, those that retain it bear remarkable similarities to extant reptiles. He writes that secondary sexual characteristics are also similar between birds and reptiles, with both groups frequently utilizing bright colors and structures for display.Heilmann (1926) pp. 115‚Äì125. He concludes the section by offering a few more comparisons of structures and organs, including the lungs, ambiens muscle, and beak and scale sheaths. Taken together, Heilmann interprets these many similarities as further evidence for the close kinship of birds and reptiles.Heilmann (1926) p. 132. =Part IV: The Proavian= In the final section Heilmann seeks to synthesize the information in the previous three sections to uncover the probable origins in a particular group of ancestors. In doing so he discusses the specific morphology of a hypothetical creature, which he refers to as \\"the proavian\\", that must have existed between modern birds and their reptilian ancestors. After making a bold assertion that birds are descended from reptiles, Heilmann cites Dollo's law of irreversibility as the primary reason why he believes birds cannot be descended from theropod dinosaurs, despite their many morphological similarities. Dollo's Law states that a feature or organ once lost by evolution cannot be regained. One consistently confounding issue Heilmann had encountered in his research into the bird-reptile link was that modern birds possess a wishbone and theropod dinosaurs, by his observations, did not. Since ancient reptilian fossils that predated dinosaurs clearly possessed a different sort of wishbone, Heilmann concluded that this feature could not have been lost and regained again over the course of evolution. Based on this law, he therefore rejected the possibility of a direct theropod ancestor of birds, though he acknowledged that theropods and birds must have shared a close relationship.Heilmann (1926) pp. 139. Heilmann's reconstruction of his hypothetical \\"Proavis\\" Throughout this section, Heilmann examines several groups of possible ancestors in addition to coelurosaurs, including pterosaurs, predentates, and pseudosuchians. Based on his rejection of theropods due to the wishbone issue as well as what Heilmann saw as striking morphological similarities between the skull of Archaeopteryx, Aetosaurus and Euparkeria, Heilmann concludes that a pseudosuchian origin of birds is the most probable. The final part of this section addresses the issue of the Proavian, which Heilmann illustrated speculatively both in skeleton in a natural setting. He constructed a hypothetical skull for this animal based on a mathematical combination of the skulls of Archaeopteryx, Euparkeria, Aetosaurus, and Ornithosuchus. He constructed its skeleton in a similar manner. In this section he also compares his own Proavis to a similar sort of Proavis constructed by the American naturalist William Beebe. Heilmann examines and rejects Beebe's own Proavis (named \\"Tetrapteryx\\" by Beebe) based on his analysis of Beebe's documentation of pelvic wings in bird embryos, which Heilmann found little evidence for.Heilmann (1926) pp. 196‚Äì199. He concludes this final section by fleshing out his Proavis and summarizing his view of bird origins, in which birds would have departed from reptiles at the pseudosuchians. From this branching point, birds and dinosaurs would have evolved along parallel evolutionary tracks for millions of years, as cousins rather than ancestors.Bakker (1986) pp. 306‚Äì318 He imagines that these reptiles would have gradually assumed a bipedal gait, and transformed eventually from terrestrial runners to arboreal climbers, developing leaping capabilities ever increasing in length. Along the way, the ancestral reptilian scales would have become \\"frayed\\" and gradually developed into feathers, beginning along the forearm and tail and gradually spreading to the entire body. The need for this animal to be an adept climber would have catalyzed the lengthening of its phalanges, which would eventually become long and strong enough to support a wing. Powerful muscles would have developed to anchor these limbs, which would have reacted upon the breastbone. All of this together would have facilitated the origin of an accelerated metabolic rate, resulting in the warm-blooded state known of modern birds. This development would have occurred alongside of the enlargement of the brain, needed to coordinate and supervise these refined features. It is in this way, Heilmann concludes, the reptile has been changed into a bird.Heilmann (1926) p. 202. Legacy In 1868, Thomas Huxley published On the animals which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles, making a strong case for the bird-dinosaur ancestral link.Huxley (1868) pp. 66‚Äì75 Huxley's proposal that birds arose from dinosaurs ‚Äì based primarily on his observation of the similarities between Archaeopteryx and Compsognathus ‚Äì remained respectable and widespread in the paleontological community until the publication of The Origin of Birds.Paul (1988) p. 195. Heilmann more than anyone else was responsible for a widespread rejection of the dinosaur-bird link.Wilford (1985) pp. 186‚Äì187. His conclusions involved more than the mere rejection of a dinosaurian ancestry for birds, however: for instance, he favored the arboreal origin of avian flight, he allied birds firmly with reptiles instead of mammals, and he was responsible for finally putting an end to the idea that birds descended from pterosaurs.Paul (2002) pp. 9‚Äì10. Several aspects of his research have continued to be influential long after its publication.Feduccia (1999) p. 55. =Wishbones and the dinosaur-bird link= The proposed thecodontian ancestry eventually fell out of favor, in part because the clade \\"thecodontia\\" is not monophyletic, meaning that it has no unique, diagnostic characteristics (and is largely considered an obsolete grouping today).Fastovsky & Weishampel (2005) p. 324. But the principal reason why Heilmann's hypothesis was proven incorrect lies in the issue of the clavicle. Heilmann came extremely close to linking theropods and birds to one another, even going so far as to write that \\"it would seem a rather obvious conclusion that it is amongst the Coelurosaurs that we are to look for the bird ancestor.\\" However, he was prevented from doing so by the apparent lack of the clavicle in the predatory dinosaurs, which reflected his strict adherence to Dollo's Law: reptilian ancestors had possessed a clavicle, but had lost it at some point during their evolution to the dinosaurs. Therefore, in order for Heilmann to believe that bird ancestry lie in the dinosaurs, there would need to be proof of clavicles in dinosaurian clades. Original drawing of the 1924 Oviraptor specimen, including the misidentified wishbone Most coincidentally, a small theropod dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops had been discovered while Heilmann was working on his book, and was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. Figure 8 of Osborn's paper, redrawn from the fossil, shows what was later proven to be an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms, interpreted by Osborn as the interclavicle (\\"Ic.\\" in Figure 8).Osborn (1924) pp. 1‚Äì12. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified.Paul (2003) p. 191. If Heilmann had examined this paper as closely as he had much of his source material ‚Äì or had travelled to New York to see the specimens in person ‚Äì he may have reversed his conclusions entirely. As it was, Heilmann's conclusion was so persuasive that it forestalled further debate on the subject even in the face of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle,Camp (1936) pp. 39‚Äì56. but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.Paul (2010) p. 10. The reinvigoration of interest in the dinosaur‚Äìbird link was largely due to the discoveries and research of paleontologist John Ostrom in the 1960s. In particular was his discovery and description of the well-preserved dromaeosaur dinosaur Deinonychus. Ostrom described Deinonychus as being extremely bird- like, with avian features such as a furcula, large sternal plates, horizontal posture, a birdlike spine, and ossified sternal ribs and uncinate processes. Ostrom's study of this animal had the effect of revolutionizing the way people thought about dinosaurs: as metabolically energetic, active predators.Ostrom (1969) pp. 1‚Äì165. Some years later, Ostrom also reanalyzed the fossils of Archaeopteryx, concluding that the animal was more reptilian than originally described by Heilmann, noting in particular the similarity of its feet to those of Deinonychus, as well as a host of other features.Ostrom (1976) pp. 91‚Äì182. In fact, so strong were the similarities that the hand of Archaeopteryx was later described as \\"a miniature version of Deinonychus's.\\" These discoveries provided the basis for the revival of the dinosaur‚Äìancestry hypothesis of bird origins. =Models of flight evolution= Heilmann envisioned that birds evolved from ground‚Äìdwelling animals that became arboreal and capable of jumping between branches over time. Their descendants would eventually be able to glide as the length of leaps increased, leading to greater specialization and eventual flapping capabilities. This \\"from the trees down\\" hypothesis was originally proposed by Othniel C. Marsh in 1880. This general theory about the mode of the evolution of flight in birds has persisted to modern times, especially (but not exclusively) among opponents of a theropod origin of birds.Chiappe (2007) pp. 33‚Äì34. This includes paleontologists such as Alan Feduccia, who essentially agree with Heilmann's assertion that the ancestors of birds must have been arboreal.Tudge (2010) p. 58. The origin of bird flight itself is still hotly debated. It is clear that feathers must have been a prerequisite for flight in birds (though flight may have not been a prerequisite for feathers). There has yet to be a consensus on whether flight involved from the ground up or the trees down, and Heilmann was largely responsible for popularizing the trees-down idea early on. The modern idea of the arboreal (or trees-down) hypothesis has changed little since Heilmann's time, and it states that bird flight would have originated by climbing birds gliding down from the tops of trees, making gliding a precursor to flapping or powered flight. As these early birds became more efficient gliders, they would have begun to extend their range and capability by developing more powerful flight. In this proposed mode of bird evolution, Heilmann's \\"Proavis\\" is strongly implicated, which would have probably been a climbing, perching, early-stage gliding quadruped. This hypothesis for the origin of bird flight has had many adherents, including Walter J. Bock and Alan Feduccia. Competing with the arboreal hypothesis is the idea that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up trees or other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier. The arboreal hypothesis was popular in Heilmann's day, even prior to his research, as it had been advanced by Marsh. It fell out of favor following Ostrom's research in the 1960s and 1970s, which suggested that the ancestors of birds were fast‚Äìrunning bipedal animals, lending credence to the cursorial model. The focus shifted back to the arboreal model when several Chinese non‚Äìavian theropods from the Early Cretaceous were found in the early 2000s. These new finds, represented chiefly by Epidendrosaurus and Microraptor, have been described as possessing features that indicate an arboreal lifestyle; Microraptor even has flight feathers on its legs, which suggest it was a glider. While the arboreal hypothesis is still popular in modern times, there are several proponents of the cursorial model and no consensus has been established. Adherence to the arboreal model is shared both by paleontologists who accept the dinosaurian ancestry of birds, and by the minority who still believe birds to have evolved from a non-dinosaurian group of reptiles. Although the arboreal model was somewhat popular before Heilmann's research, his writings helped to advance and popularize it and the idea continues to have a hold.Martin (2006) p. 470. =Beebe's leg-wings= Heilmann's illustrations, redrawn from Beebe's work, showing the hindlimbs of various nestlings and one reptile In the fourth section of The Origin of Birds, Heilmann examines the Tetrapteryx hypothesis proposed by William Beebe in 1915. This hypothesis was based on observations of bird embryos and hatchlings, which Beebe found to possess a presumably atavistic fringe of flight feathers on their hindlimbs. His main evidence came from examination of incipient quill feathers on the thigh of a four-day-old white-winged dove. He theorized based on this embryological fringe and the recapitulation theory that birds had once passed through a \\"Tetrapteryx\\" stage in their distant evolution, which he represented as a hypothetical four-winged gliding animal.Beebe (1915) pp. 38‚Äì52. Heilmann, though excited about Beebe's idea, found little evidence for these leg-wings when studying the nestlings in the Zoological Museum collection in Copenhagen. He also examined the nestlings of more basal bird species, such as the ostrich and the emu, searching for a trace of leg-wings there, again without success. Even after studying the nestlings of birds closely related to Beebe's doves, including pigeons, he still found no trace of leg-wings. Instead he found on the nestlings' thighs \\"a series of permanent feathers, and no atavism. If it were a genuine relic from such a very remote past, it would make its appearance, like a glimpse, in the embryo or squab, quickly to vanish again.\\" Heilmann went on to outline the morphological difficulties involved in such a leg-wing, indicating that it could hinder survival. In effect, Beebe's Tetrapteryx theory was completely disregarded by Heilmann, and this remained the consensus in ornithological literature until much later.Welker (1975) pp. 168‚Äì169. Despite this, Heilmann's Proavis illustrations sport a short border of feathers behind the thigh, which some authors have suggested was inspired by Beebe's Tetrapteryx idea.Christiansen (2003) pp. 99‚Äì118. The fossil of Microraptor gui, found in 2003, clearly illustrating the existence of the leg‚Äìwings that Heilmann denied Beebe was relatively undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as is evidenced by the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s.Beebe (1942) His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding.Xu et al (2003) pp. 335‚Äì340. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.Fucheng et al (2006) pp. 395‚Äì404. Today, Beebe's 1915 description of his hypothetical four-winged bird ancestor is regarded as prescient, and there is no doubt that Microraptor looks startlingly similar to the almost-century old Tetrapteryx illustrations.Prum (2003) pp. 323‚Äì324. After its discovery, Microraptor had the effect of both reinvigorating the arboreal hypothesis as well as finally putting an end to the widespread acceptance of Heilmann's disregard for the Tetrapteryx theory.Chinsamy-Turan (2005) p. 135.

(A represents an atom, p a proton, and an antiproton.) A portion of the kinetic energy of the initial proton is used to create two additional nuclei: another proton plus an antiproton. Matter to energy conversion Conventional nuclear reactions such as nuclear fission and nuclear fusion convert relatively small amounts of matter only indirectly into useful energy, such as electricity or rocket thrust. For electricity production released nuclear energy in the form of heat is typically used to boil water to turn a turbine-generator. Possibly matter is almost completely converted into energy in the cores of neutron stars and black holes by a process of nuclei collapse resulting in: proton ‚Üí positron + 938 MeV, resulting in a >450 MeV positron-electron jet. Trace nuclei swept up in such a beam would achieve an approximate energy of (nucleus mass/electron mass) √ó 450 MeV, for example an iron atom could achieve about 45 TeV. An up to 45 TeV atom impacting a proton in the interstellar medium should result in the p + A process described above. Ion-electron or positron-electron plasma with magnetic confinement theoretically allows direct conversion of particle energy to electricity by the separation of the positive particles from the negative particles with magnetic deflection. Direct conversion of particle energy to thrust is theoretically simpler, merely requiring magnetically directing a neutral plasma beam. Present lab production of relativistic 5 MeV positron- electron beams mimic on a small scale the relativistic jets from compact stars, and allow small scale studies how different elements interact with 5 MeV positron-electron beams, how energy is transferred to particles, the shock effect of gamma-ray bursts, and possible direct thrust and electricity generation from neutral plasmas. Lab positron-electron plasmas could be useful for studying compact star jets and other phenomena.

He studied and worked in France in the early 1900s, where he became an early Chinese Anarchist under the influence of Li Shizeng and Wu Zhihui, his lifelong friends. He became wealthy trading Chinese artworks in the West and investing on the Shanghai stock exchange. Zhang gave generous financial support to Sun Yat-sen and was an early patron of Chiang Kai-shek. In the 1920s, he, Li, Wu and the educator Cai Yuanpei were known as the fiercely anti-Communist Four Elders of the Chinese Nationalist Party.  Early years  Zhang was born September 13, 1877, in Wuxing, Zhejiang, but his family's ancestral home was Nanxun, Zhejiang Province, where his grandfather was a prosperous salt and silk merchant. Zhang's father, Zhang Baoshan (Âº†ÂÆùÂñÑ, 1856‚Äì1926), developed the family business, and married into a family of Shanghai silk compradores which had extensive contacts among Western businesses. As a boy, Zhang was adventurous and bright; he enjoyed both riding horses and calligraphy, memorized classics, and was especially good at Go. As a child he suffered from a form of arthritis, which continued to affect him for the rest of his life, and an eye condition which eventually required him to wear dark glasses. Yet he was a sociable child. So self-confident was he that he gave himself the name \\"Renjie,\\" meaning \\"outstanding personality.\\" Zhang's grandfather, convinced that Renjie should become an official, purchased the office of \\"Expectant Daotai\\" for him. The family arranged a marriage for him with Yao Hui, and the first of his five daughters was born in 1901. Nanxun, the Zhang Family Ancestral Home On a trip to Beijing in 1901 to arrange a suitable posting for himself as \\"Expectant Daotai,\\" Zhang met the equally well-placed and adventurous Li Shizeng, son of a high Qing official. The two discovered that they shared a dissatisfaction with the state of Chinese politics and society. When in 1902 Li was appointed as attache on the staff of the Minister to France, Sun Baoqi, Zhang used his family influence to join him and be appointed as \\"Third Secretary.\\" After stopping over in Shanghai to meet Wu Zhihui, who was by then a well-known anti-Manchu revolutionary, Zhang and Li arrived in Paris as part of Sun's delegation on December 17, 1902. Zhang's wife, Yao Hui, accompanied him. Li quickly resigned his official position to study French and biology, but Zhang did not resign until 1905.  Paris, anarchism, and revolution  In Paris he established the Ton-ying Company (), with a gallery on the Place de la Madeleine, which imported Chinese tea, silk, and art. This was the first of its kind in France, and employed, among others, C.T. Loo, who was to become one of the most influential dealers of Chinese art. With the financial assistance of $300,000 Chinese dollars from his father, the firm was the basis of Zhang's own considerable fortune. Ton-ying remained a family business branching out to New York from its original base in Paris and its source in Shanghai. Because of Zhang‚Äôs position in China, the Company was able to source high quality works of art directly, including items from the old Imperial Collection. Although Zhang later dealt extensively on the Shanghai stock exchange, a great deal of his wealth and therefore the financing of the Nationalist cause, came from the profits created by the Ton-ying Company. Wu Zhihui, Zhang, and Li Shizeng, Leaders of the Xin Shijie Society Li soon introduced Zhang to the doctrines of Anarchism and they began to apply them to analyzing the situation in China. Zhang told friends of the anti-religion and anti-family theories which he had adopted. He also opposed traditional ideas of sex: \\"It is obvious,\\" he told them, \\"the reason why society is divided along sexual lines is because of traditional customs.... It's not impossible to reform them.\\" Zhang's interest in anarchism later cooled, however, and he was probably more attracted by its aura of science and iconoclastic social reform than its political side. On a trip to London in 1905, Zhang renewed his friendship with Wu Zhihui, who was nearly ten years older than Li and Zhang, and a deeper scholar. Backed by Zhang's money, the three formed the Shijie she (The World), a publishing house for radical social ideas. On a steamship returning from China to Europe in 1906, Zhang met and was entranced by Sun Yat-sen, the anti-Manchu revolutionist, giving him the first of many substantial contributions. The two established a code for Sun to use if he needed money: \\"A\\" meant send $10,000 Chinese dollars, \\"B\\" meant send $20,000, and so forth. On his return to Paris, Zhang led Wu and Li to join Sun's Tongmenghui, the more politically radical of the anti-Manchu groups. Zhang had been sworn into the society by Hu Hanmin and Feng Ziyou, two of Sun's important lieutenants (in view of his attacks on religion, they allowed him to omit the oath \\"by heaven\\"). The three anarchists ‚ÄîZhang, Li, and Wu ‚Äî established a relationship which lasted for the rest of their lives. In 1908, they started a journal, Xin Shiji (New Century), titled La Novaj Tempaj in Esperanto, funded by Zhang and edited by Wu. Another major contributor was Chu Minyi, a student from Zhejiang who accompanied Zhang back from China and would help him travel in the years to come. The journal translated radical French thinkers and introduced Chinese students in France to the history of radicalism, especially the anarchist classics of Peter Kropotkin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and √âlis√©e Reclus. They were especially impressed by their conversations with Jean Grave, who had spent two years in prison for publishing \\"Society on the Brink of Death\\" (1892) an anarchist pamphlet. But Zhang, who continued to travel back and forth to China, did not have money enough to finance both Sun Yat-sen and the journal, which ceased publication in 1910. When the Revolution of 1911 broke out, Zhang returned to China. He was one of the organizers of the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement, which sent worker-students to France. Though he did not take up Sun's offer to be minister of finance, he continued to give financial support to Sun and his party, which became especially important when Sun was forced to flee to Japan as Yuan Shikai took control of the new republic. Zhang used his money and charm to make friends in many parts of Shanghai society, including the underworld, and especially among those from Zhejiang province.  Relations with the Nationalist Party and Chiang Kai-shek  During these years, Zhang did well on the Shanghai stock market and shared his earnings with Sun and the emerging Nationalist Party (GMD). His GMD friends from Zhejiang included Chen Qimei, a patron of the then unknown Chiang Kai-shek. When Chen was assassinated, apparently on orders of Yuan Shikai, Zhang took over Chen's role as Chiang's mentor. After Yuan's death in 1916, Sun continued to rely on Zhang, and Zhang offered Chiang Kai-shek substantial financial help, personal advice, and key political backing. On a visit to Zhang's home, Chiang met Ah Feng (Jennie), a friend of Zhu Yimin, Zhang's second wife, and immediately determined to marry her. When Ah Feng's family commissioned a detective report which found that Chiang was not only unemployed but also had a wife and concubine, Zhang reassured them that he would vouch for the young man's good intentions. At their wedding, Zhang delivered a speech wishing the couple happiness and success. Zhang also hit it off with Chen Lifu, another of Chiang's most important advisers and supporters, also from Zhejiang, organizer of the right-wing CC Clique Letter from Sun Yat-sen to Zhang (January 8, 1923 In 1923, Sun invited Soviet advisors to reorganize the Nationalist Party and incorporate the Chinese communists, setting up an internal rivalry between the left and the right wings. Zhang, as a right-wing leader, was elected to the Central Executive Committee (CEC), along with Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei, all from Zhejiang. They became known as the GMD's ‚ÄúFour Elders\\", or Yuanlao (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÂÖöÂÖÉËÄÅ), in Japanese, genr≈ç. Chiang Kai-shek built his rise to power and subsequent long political life on his ability to skillfully using this and other groups for a certain time, then shifting his support to opposing factions to keep both friends and enemies off balance. When Sun died in 1925, Zhang was one of the witnesses to his deathbed Political Will, and was elected to the new State Council which convened in Canton. In the Zhongshan Gunboat Incident of March 1926, Chiang Kai-shek's life was supposedly endangered by a kidnapping plot. Chiang moved to suppress the Leftists, surprising many who had thought of him as a leftist, threatening a debilitating schism. Zhang counseled Chiang against identifying himself too closely with the right, and may have attempted to reconcile Chiang with the leftist Wang Jingwei, who had been his friend from their anarchists days in Europe. The Four Elders were fiercely anti-Communist. Their anarchist principles led them to see the poor and uneducated as members of the Chinese nation, not members of the working class. They accused the Communists of creating class divisions and promoting class warfare. The radical wing of the party, led by Wang Jingwei, who set up its own headquarters at Wuhan, mounted a campaign with the slogan \\"Down With The Muddle-headed, Old and Feeble Zhang Jingjiang.\\" Zhang remarked to his friend Chen Lifu, \\"if I were really muddle-headed, old, and feeble, would it be worthwhile to make the effort to knock me down?\\" A Soviet advisor recalled that Zhang \\"was able to generate incredible energy in the struggle with the leftists and Communists\\" even though he could not walk and had to be carried upstairs in his wheelchair. In April 1927, Zhang and the other Four Elders urged Chiang Kai-shek to purge the leftists and initiate the White Terror which killed thousands. At this time, a rift opened between Zhang and Chiang Kai-shek which eventually became bitter and lasted until Zhang's death. Zhang had introduced Chiang to his second wife, Jennie, who was a friend of his wife, Yao Hui, and had felt aggrieved when Chiang abandoned her for Soong Mei- ling. To intimates Zhang confided \\"a man of moral integrity should not go back on his word, let alone a state leader!\\" In the following years, Soong Mei-ling apparently resented Zhang for his loyalty to Jennie. She and the Zhang family did not speak to each other. In 1927, after the success of the Northern Expedition and the alliance with the wealthy Soong family, Chiang perhaps was in less need of Zhang's help, and might also have feared Zhang's growing power. Zhang as an anarchist also opposed organized religion, while Chiang converted to Christianity. The four friends from anarchist days of cultural exchange and education in France collaborated on the National Labor University, which revived two abandoned factories and used them for Work‚ÄìStudy. Li Shizeng became chairman of the newly created Imperial Palace Museum in 1925 and was responsible for the inventory of the Imperial Collections. Zhang oversaw the first stage of the removal of more than half of the Imperial Collections to Shanghai in 1933 following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. It was during this period that many imperial works of art found their way into Western collections, through dealers such as Zhang. Chiang then asked Zhang to head the National Reconstruction Commission, whose assignment was to control the industrial sector of the economy. The Commission confiscated a number of private mines and power companies, though its influence was soon undercut by the National Economic Council headed by T. V. Soong. Over the next few years, Zhang continued to play a profitable and influential role in Shanghai financial circles, sometimes in conjunction with Soong, sometimes in rivalry.  Provincial government and declining influence  From November 1928 to January 1930, Zhang was governor of Zhejiang, his and Chiang Kai-shek's home province. Zhang suppressed rural unrest, perhaps to avoid the opposition of landlords and local elites to his projects for building infrastructure for the power industry, as well as heading the National Reconstruction Commission. However, in 1931, T. V. Soong took charge of economic development training and limited the powers of Zhang and his commissions. Yet Zhang's ambitious plans to expand the power grid and infrastructure made some progress before the destruction in the Japanese invasion. His pet project, however, the Hangzhou Electric Plant, had to be sold to a private group because low demand and budget shortfalls. Zhang's influence on Chiang Kai-shek continued to decline and relations cooled. The Generalissimo placed men who were loyal into the Zhejiang government and undercut Zhang's authority in ways which embarrassed him. \\"If he wants me to hand in my resignation,\\" Zhang asked after Chiang criticized the state of security in Zhejiang, \\"why should he play such an underhanded trick?\\" Giving the excuse that he needed to travel abroad for his health, Zhang resigned as governor in 1930. He kept his position in the National Reconstruction Commission but found that Chiang did not grant it enough money for its work. Zhang contributed 4,000 yuan of his own. It is said that when he heard the news of the Japanese attack on Shanghai in 1931, he was struck with the strength of the Chinese proverb \\"the strong making meat of the weak,\\" and became a vegetarian. By the mid-1930s, Zhang had largely retired from politics and pursued his artistic inclinations and began to practice Buddhism. In 1937, at the age of fifty-four, in spite of failing health and financial strains, he decided to take his family to live in Hong Kong, then left for Europe. When his brother suggested that he telegraph Chiang Kai-shek to inform him, Zhang snapped \\"Why should I inform him? He's not my boss! It's none of his business!\\" Zhang and his family settled in Riverdale, in New York City. He and Li Shizeng sometimes met to look over the Hudson River and reminisce. Zhang died on 3 September 1950. When his daughter, who was living in Taipei, heard the news, she did not have the courage to inform Chiang Kai-shek directly, fearing the lingering enmity between the two men. Instead, she informed Wu Zhihui, who visited Chiang at 6:00 AM the next morning. Chiang sent a telegram of condolence to the family in the United States: \\"You were my companion in adversity and our friendly feelings were close...\\" Chiang presided and wrote an inscription in his own calligraphy for Zhang's memorial service: \\"Deep grief for losing my teacher.\\" He arranged for the Nationalist Party in Taiwan to send money to Zhang's family for the services in New York.  Family life  Zhang Family Residence in Nanxun Zhang was the member of an extensive family. His father, Zhang Baoshan (Âº†ÂÆùÂñÑ 1856-1926), had five children, of whom Jingjiang was the second. He married twice, first to Yao Hui ÂßöËïô ( -1918). The marriage produced five daughters: Therese ËïäËã± (1901?- 1950); Yvonne Ëä∑Ëã±(1902-1975); Suzanne Ëä∏Ëã± (1904- 1998); Georgette (ËçîËã± Liying; 1904-1995); Helen (ËèÅËã± Jingying 1910-2004). Georgette in 1930 married Eugene Chen in Paris. Helen married Robert K.S. Lim, a medical doctor from Singapore who worked with Chinese army during the war, in 1946. In 1918, Yao Hui was killed by a falling branch in Riverside Park in New York City. In 1920, Zhang met and married Zhu Yimin (Êú±ÈÄ∏Ê∞ë 1901-1991 in Shanghai. They had five daughters and two sons.  Legacy and reputation  Nelson and Laurence Chang's history of the Zhang family points out that Western histories portray Zhang Jingjiang as a \\"menacing figure, a malign influence in the Chinese political scene.\\" They object to Sterling Seagrave's The Soong Dynasty, for instance, which says that Zhang's disease \\"crippled one of his feet and thereafter gave him the lurching gait of Shakespeare's Richard III. This sinister millionaire, whom some Westerners referred to as Curio Chang and the French in Shanghai referred to as Quasimodo, became one of Chiang Kai-shek's most important political patrons.\\" They go on to recognize that Zhang was a revolutionary who was not afraid to use violence, but that his political rivals did much to darken his reputation. Zhang was a successful investor and business man and one of his investments was a European style neighbourhood in Shanghai, Jing'an Villa, which still stands today. It can be found at 1025 Nanjing Xi Lu, in Shanghai's Jing'an district. Built in 1932, it once housed members of the Western and Chinese elite in Shanghai's International Settlement. Its European-inspired architecture stands as a reminder of the interaction between Europe and China, of which Zhang was a part. Nelson and Laurence Chang's book \\"The Zhangs from Nanxun\\" includes a family tree (page 526) which lists the East Branch of the family: descendants of Zhang Baoshan include his sons Zhang Jingjiang and Zhang Bianqun, whose eldest son the scholar Zhang Naiyan was the first Chancellor of the University at Nanjing and Chinese Ambassador to Belgium. Zhang Naiyan's daughter Jane Chang emigrated to Lynn, Massachusetts in 1949 with her husband Arthur Yau; their eldest son is poet and critic John Yau.

Goff from 1966-69. Work concentrated on two mounds joined by a saddle. The East Mound (85 m in diameter, 9 m high) yielded a series of first-millennium B.C. buildings (Baba Jan III-I) above Bronze Age (Baba Jan IV) graves. On the Central Mound (120 m in diameter, 15 m high), excavation concentrated on the Baba Jan III Manor on the summit; an 8 x 6 m Deep Sounding provides a partial late fourth- to mid- second-millennium B.C. sequence Excavations at BƒÅbƒÅ JƒÅn: The Bronze Age Occupation Clare Goff Iran Vol. 14, (1976), pp. 19-40(ho3einhajy) Archaeology Baba Jan V. Levels 7-6 in the bottom 2 m of the Deep Sounding yielded late fourth-millennium B.C. chalcolithic pottery similar to Godin (Gowdƒ´n) VI .(Goff, 1971, fig. 7; Goff, 1976, pl. VIIIc-d)(ho3einhajy) Baba Jan IV. In the Deep Sounding on the Central Mound, two levels of domestic architecture (level 5, 2300-2100 B.C. and level 4, 1800-1500 B.C.) were separated by a period of abandonment during which four burials were dug into the area. Four other Baba Jan IV graves were cut into virgin soil on the East Mound; these date to the late third (Goff, 1976, fig. 11.10-13, 16-18) and mid-second millennium B.C.(ibid., fig. 11.19-23)ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ ÿ≠ÿßÿ¨€å ÿØŸàŸÑ€åÿ≥⁄©ÿßŸÜ€å The assemblage is comparable to that of period III at Godin Tepe. =Baba Jan III= Baba Jan III. On the Central Mound only the superimposed foundations from two phases of a Manor (30 x 35 m) survive. The earlier, level 2, consisted of a rectangular court with a north-south axis flanked by long narrow rooms, the whole with towers both at the corners and midpoints of all sides. When rebuilt in level 1, the Manor consisted of a central columned hall (one row of three columns) surrounded by long narrow rooms. On the East Mound the almost 2,000 m2 excavation yielded the Fort and Painted Chamber. The excavated portion of the Fort, whose walls survived to a height of 3‚Äì4 m, consisted of a large (12 m2) room with four irregularly placed columns and surrounded by long rectangular chambers. A spiral ramp led either to a second story or the roof. Further rooms extended to the south. The Painted Chamber (10 x 12 m) unit was added at the east end of the Fort. This ceremonial hall, which opened southward onto an enclosed courtyard, had two columns, a niche and doorway with reveals, white walls decorated with red paint, and a painted- tile ceiling. The Fort and Painted Chamber were probably the seat of a local ruler. The extent and nature of the settlement are uncertain. Fire destroyed this complex at the end of the eighth century B.C. The pottery evidence suggests that the East Mound buildings were built and used after the Central Mound Manors. The columned halls at Baba Jan are analogous to contemporary buildings of Hasanlu (·∏§asanl≈´) IV, Godin Tepe II, and Nush-i Jan (N≈´≈°-e JƒÅn). Baba Jan III pottery, long known as Genre Luristan, was a handmade, turntable- finished buff ware with distinctive decoration in a thick red-brown matte paint. Typical motifs included ladders and pendant triangles with hatching or crosshatching. Common vessel shapes were simple: wide-bodied jars with narrow necks, small bowls with incurved rims and horizontal loop handles, conical bowls, and cups. A range of iron weapons and tools were found, but classic Luristan bronze artifacts were uncommon. =Baba Jan II= Baba Jan II. The walls of the ruined Fort remained standing until late in Baba Jan II; squatters briefly reoccupied the eastern rooms. While the eastern wall of the Fort remained standing, three phases of small structures were built in the area of the Painted Chamber and its courtyard. The Genre Luristan pottery of Baba Jan III continued with simpler decoration, but small quantities of a new type of wheel-made buff pottery with small golden mica inclusions appeared. The most common shapes were deep bowls with a thickened rim and horizontal handle, double-handled jars, and jars with a vertical handle and tubular spout with trefoil-mouth. This ware and characteristic shapes are very similar to Tepe Nush i Jan level I (MalƒÅyer plain). Baba Jan II probably dates to the seventh century B.C. =Baba Jan I= Baba Jan I. On the East Mound poorly preserved village house walls covered the summit and extended down the east slope in a series of terraces. Superposition of architectural remains suggests two to three phases. The buff ware Baba Jan I assemblage, whose closest affinities are with Period II at Godin Tepe (KangƒÅvar valley), is characterized by numerous bowl forms and is a development from the wheelmade pottery of Baba Jan II. Baba Jan III wares disappear. Baba Jan I probably falls within the Achaemenid period.Originally Published: December 15, 1988 Last Updated: August 18, 2011 This article is available in print.

Its origins may be seen in the mule staircases in steep terrain in open country.  Use in interior rooms  Its design principles found their way from road construction into building architecture. Here an equestrian staircase was a spiral, curved or repeatedly interrupted ramp within buildings, that had a gently sloped and a non-slip floor, either smooth or frequently divided by transverse ridges. This type of ramp occurs in the towers of churches, castles, fortifications and palaces as well as in the architecture of other buildings within fortifications villas and palaces.Roswitha Beyer: Eselstreppe, in: Reallexikon zur Deutschen Kunstgeschichte, Vol. 6, 1968, Cols. 21‚Äì22 = Representation = From the 15th century, imposing equestrian staircases were built in the stately homes of the nobility. These staircases enabled riders to reach the upper floor on horseback. The equestrian staircase leading to Vladislav Hall in Prague Castle, which was built around 1500, is one of the oldest known examples. Other equestrian staircases are found: * in the Ch√¢teau d'Amboise, the Tour de Minimes and the Tour Heurtault both have equestrian staircases * in the Old Palace in Bayreuth * in the Berliner Stadtschloss (demolished 1950) * in the Ehrenburg in Brodenbach on the Moselle * in the Stallhof in Dresden * in Schloss Riedegg in Gallneukirchen * in the Landshut town residenz * in citadel in Spandau * in the Old Palace in Stuttgart = Stepless equestrian ramps = Occasionally ramps were built without any actual steps, enabling horses to draw a carriage or wagon up the incline. There are examples in Venice (St Mark's Campanile), Geneva (city hall) and Copenhagen (Round Tower).

He relented and allowed its inclusion so that he could convince Mendik to include Begotten. Mathijs wanted to include The Princess Bride, but Mendik preferred to focus on including more transgressive films, and it was not included.

To choose the final film, the authors performed a public survey; the resulting winner was In Bruges. A mobile app was released to allow readers to mark each of the films that they have seen.

Thai law provides criminal penalties for conviction of official corruption. Thailand's 2014 military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), stated that fighting corruption would be one of its main focus points, a common practice for military dictatorships following Thailand's frequent military coups. Despite the promises, officials engaged in corrupt practices with impunity, and the NCPO engaged in corrupt practices itself. Transparency International's 2018 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 99th place out of 180 countries. The index examines public sector corruption. \\"Even though Thailand has the legal framework and a range of institutions to effectively counter corruption, all levels of Thai society continue to suffer from endemic corruption.\\"  Dynamics  The intersection of business and government has resulted in a widespread use of bribes in most sectors across the country. Bribery and conflict of interests are common within Thailand's private and public sectors. Money politics in Thailand, the \\"flow of money within the political scene\\", stems from the high number of interconnects between the business and political sectors. Despite anti-corruption laws, the government bureaucracy is ineffective in enforcing them. In a survey conducted by the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce among businessmen who deal with bureaucrats who determine contract awards, 25 percent plus is the average for under-the-table fees paid in order to secure a contract from government agencies. The survey showed that 78 percent of the businessmen polled admitted that they had to pay \\"fees\\", which they said appeared to have been increasing in recent years. Some businessmen claimed that the rate charged by the greedier gatekeepers for contracts run as high as 40 percent. Police corruption is widespread. There were numerous cases in 2016 of police charged with abduction, sexual harassment, theft, and malfeasance. Authorities arrested police officers and convicted them of corruption, drug trafficking, smuggling, and intellectual property rights violations. So ubiquitous is corruption in Thailand that in 2015 the Thai group, Anti-Corruption Organization of Thailand (ACT), created a \\"Museum of Thai Corruption\\" at the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre. According to Mr Mana Nimitmongkol of ACT, \\"Thailand is a country with a culture of patronage...many generations have seen corruption and got used to it,...We wanted to create the museum in order to tell the cheaters that the things they have done are evil‚Äîthey will be recorded in the history of Thailand, and Thai people will never forget, nor forgive them.\\" Some critics charge that the museum does not go far enough. The 10 featured \\"...notorious acts of graft involve government. None touch the military or business.\\" =Cost to society= Sungsidh Piriyarangsan, Dean of the College of Social Innovation at Rangsit University, known for his corruption research, calculates that corruption will rob Thai society of between 50‚Äì100 billion baht in 2018. His estimate‚Äîdescribed by him as \\"cautious\\"‚Äî draws from 14 corruption studies funded by the Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC). In September 2019, a representative of the United Nations Development Programme observed that the Thai state could have lost 100 billion baht to corruption related to public procurement. 2014 military junta's war on corruption On 2 June 2014, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha declared \\"war on corruption\\" after seizing power in the 2014 coup d'√©tat and setting up a military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) to govern Thailand. Prayut has made the issue one of the focus areas of his premiership. The first time he spoke on his weekly TV program \\"Returning Happiness to the People\\" in August 2014, he described corruption as \\"deeply-rooted in Thai society,...\\" and made promises to fight it. However, the NCPO has engaged in high-profile corruption practices itself, including a nepotism scandal involving Prayut's brother and a questionable submarine deal with China that was widely criticized. Many critics argued that the junta's vague \\"tough on corruption\\" stance was abused to get rid of those seen as a threat to the ruling junta. = Thai anti- corruption agencies = Thailand has no lack of governmental agencies charged with combating corruption. It has seven: the Election Commission; the Office of the Auditor-General of Thailand; the Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission; the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC); the Royal Thai Police (RTP); the Department of Special Investigation; and the Office of the Attorney-General. Prayut has said he would like to see more integration and cooperation among the agencies. The junta has often spoken of the need to clean up corruption, not only among the nation's politicians, but society at large. While there have been a handful of high-profile arrests of those accused of corruption or human trafficking, officials have focused largely on small-scale public-order issues, such as banning sunbed rentals on public beaches or clearing vendors from some Bangkok sidewalks. The Office of the Public Sector's Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) announced plans in November 2015 to publish a handbook on corruption investigation procedures in a bid to shorten the investigation process. Director of PACC Sector 4 Police Lieutenant Colonel Wannop Somjintanakul, announced that Mahidol University, Rangsit University and other anti-corruption agencies are co-authoring the handbook. Mr. Sanyapong Limprasert, a law professor from Rangsit University, said the handbook is expected to set the same standards for all corruption cases and reduce the time involved in investigations. It is also intended to serve as a guideline for the authorities whenever they consider taking legal action against any individual suspected of corruption. The handbook was scheduled to be published in May 2016. =2016 crackdown on corruption= In December 2015 the Thai government announced a crackdown on \\"...corrupt 'people of influence'\\". At the behest of Prime Minister Prayut, the police, intelligence agencies, and the Interior Ministry have compiled a list of persons to be targeted. Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan says the names will be \\"verified\\" and in February‚ÄìMarch 2016 the crackdown will commence. = Criticism of the junta= Prayut has taken credit for stamping out corruption and blames the poor economy on his handling of corruption in Thailand: \\"Today the economy is slowing down because previously everybody had money to spend,\\" Prayut said on 5 June 2015 in a nationally televised speech. \\"But now we have a problem,... It's because some people spend money from illegal businesses and money from fraud. Now the government has come to set things right, causing that money to disappear.\\" Many critics asserted that the junta's rhetoric on corruption was little more than an excuse to hold on to power. \\"What the army has done...is ramp up on anti-corruption rhetoric, and part of that is to explain away why the economy has been performing below potential....There is little evidence on the policy front that the army government has made much progress in making state enterprises or the civil service more accountable to the public.\\" said Ambika Ahuja, a London-based analyst at Eurasia Group, a political-risk adviser. Blaming corruption is standard practice for Thailand's military takeovers, Ambika said. \\"Every army government uses it as one of the reasons, if not the main reason, for launching a coup. It justifies a takeover.\\" Ahuja's views were borne out in November 2015, when a media storm erupted over alleged corruption in the Rajabhakti Park project in Hua Hin. Critics also argued that the junta's stance on corruption was used to get rid of political dissent. The most notable case was an alleged corruption charge for the mishandling of a rice subsidy policy brought up against former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, whose democratically elected government was overthrown by the Junta in 2014. Other members of Yingluck's government were also charged with corruption for the rice policy, with two of Yingluck's ministers receiving a staggering 42 and 36-year prison sentence for the corruption charges respectively. The legitimacy of the charges has been questioned since their inception, critics pointed to the unusually severe sentences as an indication they were politically motivated. In January 2017, Thailand's University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce's (UTCC) \\"Corruption Situation Index\\" (CSI) claimed that national corruption was on the decline, reaching the lowest level in six years. The UTCC claimed that corruption began to ease in the latter half of 2014 after the military seized power and set up a junta-controlled government. Since then, the UTCC stated that annual losses attributed to corruption have averaged 120 billion baht, down from about 300‚Äì400 billion baht in previous years. However, the international corruption index from Transparency International showed no change in their corruption index for Thailand between 2014 and 2015, and that corruption actually worsened from 2015 to 2016. Other corruption agencies also noted a decline in transparency since the 2014 coup d'√©tat, especially in the judicial system and in civil society where the media is restricted and influenced by the military government and criticism of the current regime is heavily suppressed. At a more grassroots level, citizens disgruntled with seemingly entrenched nature of Thai corruption have pursued other means of expressing their displeasure with the corrupt status quo, including the use of graffiti. Notable cases =Rolls Royce and Thai Airways= In January 2017 a four-year investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) came to light. It determined that aircraft engine-maker Rolls-Royce had paid bribes to \\"...agents of the Thai state and employees of Thai Airways...\\" in order to secure orders for the Rolls-Royce T800 engine for its Boeing 777-200s. Rolls-Royce admitted to the charge and agreed to pay penalties. The illicit payments of US$36.38 million took place between 1991 and 2005. Bribes were paid in three tranches: # 1 June 1991 ‚Äì 30 June 1992: Rolls-Royce paid 660 million baht (US$18.8 million) # 1 March 1992 ‚Äì 31 March 1997: Rolls-Royce paid US$10.38 million # 1 April 2004 ‚Äì 28 February 2005: Rolls-Royce paid US$7.2 million The government rejected calls for Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to use his Section 44 powers to cut through red tape in the investigation of the Rolls-Royce bribery scandal. Response from the Thai government's National Anti-Corruption Commission to information provided by the SFO, is said to be \\"tepid\\" and \\"...could be more embarrassing than the scandal itself.\\" Auditor-General Pisit Leelavachiropas said his agency suspected that between 20 and 30 people were involved. \\"It's likely they accepted bribes,\\" he said. In an action by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against aircraft engine-maker Rolls-Royce, the DOJ claimed that Rolls Royce had paid more than US$11 million in commissions to win a deal with Thai Airways, aware that some of the funds would be used to bribe officials at PTT and its subsidiary, PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP). The payments were made from 2003-2013 and related to contracts for equipment and after- market products and services. PTT vowed to investigate. Admitting its guilt, Rolls-Royce paid US$170 million to settle the case. Subsequently, PTT Chairman and CEO Tevin Vongvanich said that the company was unable to find anyone who \\"allegedly took bribes\\". =Vorayudh Yoovidhya, Red Bull heir= In 2012, Vorayudh Yoovidhya, a grandson of Red Bull co-founder Chaleo Yoovidhya, was driving a Ferrari in the early morning of 3 September when he hit and killed Police Senior Sgt Maj Wichean Glanprasert, the patrol unit chief of the police station in the Thong Lo area of Bangkok. Vorayudh's car hit the officer and dragged his body some distance. Vorayudh fled the scene, returning home. He subsequently attempted to have an employee at his home take the blame for the crime. Vorayudh was charged with reckless driving causing death, failing to help a crash victim, and speeding. Vorayudh then disappeared. Police failed to indict him for speeding and its statute of limitations expired in 2013. The reckless driving charge expired in September 2017. Vorayudh has been repeatedly summoned to meet authorities. He has avoided each meeting, his lawyer claiming that he was sick or out of the country on business. Police have failed to capture him and claim to have no clue as to his whereabouts. Bangkok's press maintains that the cases of \\"Bangkok's deadly rich kids\\" are handled differently from most deadly car crashes, in which common Thais are arrested, prosecuted, and jailed. Vorayudh failed to show for his latest, 30 March 2017, summons. A spokesman for the Office of the Attorney-General said the defendant is in Britain on personal business and had asked for another postponement. The spokesman declared that Vorayudh's five-year refusal to appear is acceptable because he had filed a complaint of unfair treatment. He went on to say that the fact that Vorayuth was from one of Thailand's richest families was not a factor in his excused absence. =Sanit Mahathavorn, Bangkok police chief= When the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) revealed the asset declarations of new NLA members, it was disclosed that Bangkok police chief Police Lieutenant General Sanit Mahathavorn had received monthly payments of 50,000 baht since 2015 from alcohol conglomerate Thai Beverage PLC as an adviser to the firm. Sanit also serves as a member of the city's alcohol control committee, raising conflict of interest issues. Calls for him to step down from his police post were immediate. In January 2017 a Royal Thai Police investigation confirmed that Sanit is not violating police rules by holding an advisory role with a major alcohol conglomerate. On 1 March 2017, more than two months after the original allegations were made, both Sanit and ThaiBev denied that he was ever employed by ThaiBev and that the report was due to clerical error. Just two weeks after Sanit's denial that he was on ThaiBev's payroll, Thailand's Office of the Ombudsman said that it had obtained his original financial disclosure document and found it certified with his signature. It now appears that there were two versions of Sanit's financial disclosure form, one listing ThaiBev payments and one with no mention of ThaiBev. Unexplained is how the ThaiBev salary did not appear on the version of Sanit's financial disclosure statement posted online by the NACC. In mid-March the Office of the Ombudsman, which had accepted a petition to investigate the case, announced that there is not enough evidence for it to consider and the matter is closed. =Theft of funds for the poor= * A 2017 governmental initiative to distribute funds to poor people, low-income earners, and HIV/AIDS patients in Thailand's 76 provinces was looted by officials in 49 provinces. , 104 million baht allocated to help the poor in those provinces had been misappropriated, amounting to 85 percent of the amount distributed. An investigator from the Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission stated that fraud came in various forms: there were aid applications with fake documents, applications accompanied by both genuine and fake documents, and aid applications from unqualified applicants. The destitute purported to be recipients either received no money or only partial payment. In some cases, culpable officials told the destitute recipients to lie to investigators, claiming that they had received the full amount due them. The crimes came to light in January. They were exposed by a group of Maha Sarakham University students, one of whom was later castigated by a professor for whistleblowing. They were told to complete forms and forge signatures on receipts for 2,000 villagers involving nearly seven million baht while they were working as interns at the Khon Kaen Protection for the Destitute Centre last year. They were ordered to do so by the departmental chief and some senior officials. * An illiterate 66-year-old grandmother who cares for her 15-year-old granddaughter with cerebral palsy is entitled to a caregiver's allowance of 9,125 baht per month under the Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities Act 2007. As she was unaware of this, she never collected her allowance. She was invited to join the Network of Parents Club of Children with Disabilities in Kalasin Province. She was to take her granddaughter to the club three times per week in exchange for 1,000 baht per week. The club retained her ATM card and bank books. The president of the club induced her to sign an agreement to receive the 4,000 baht monthly stipend. The club allegedly collected the government disbursement of 9,125 baht, paid the stipend, and pocketed the 5,125 baht monthly difference. Thanida Anu-an, a whistleblower who uncovered the scheme, also helped to uncover several other similar cases. =Ghost students= Thai schools receive government subsidies for each enrolled student. Those in grades seven to nine are subsidized at 4,800 baht each per year. Students in grades 10 to 12 are worth 6,250 baht each to their schools. This has allegedly led to schools inflating their enrollments with \\"ghost\\" students. One school was reported to have 196 ghost students. It is unclear in this case where the ghost student subsidies of 940,000 to 1,225,000 baht ended up. Besides increased subsidies. directors may be motivated by the possibility of transfer to a bigger school: when a school is in the range of 500-1,499 students, the school director is permitted to transfer to a larger school, albeit at no increase in salary. Police suspect that postings to larger schools are attractive as they widen the scope for \\"tea money\\" kickbacks to directors from parents seeking to place their children in the school. =Temple renovation scam= A former head of the National Office of Buddhism (NOB), Panom Sornsilp, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on 27 December 2019 after being found guilty by the Criminal Court of corruption in connection with temple funds. Sentenced with him, on similar charges, was Wasawat Kittithirasith, the former director of the Office of Temple Renovation and Development and Religious Welfare. Two others, who served as brokers, approached temples and offered to help them secure funding from the Office of Buddhism for temple renovation in return for a 75% under- the-table commission. They were sentenced to six years and eight months and one year and eight months. The temple fund scam dates from 2017, when the abbot of Wat Takaela in Phetchaburi Province filed a complaint with the Anti- Corruption Police Command seeking an investigation. His temple was allocated 10 million baht by the NOB for renovation, but he was told to return the bulk of the money to the officials who helped to secure the funding. The scam worked by having unofficial brokers, with connections to NOB officials, tell the abbots that they could arrange funding for renovations, but only on the condition that they return three-quarters of the money to the officials and use what remained for renovation. Several temple abbots joined in the scam and pocketed temple funds without spending any on temple renovation. =Futsal fields inaction= In August 2019, the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) voted 9‚Äì0 to indict three Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) MPs and 21 accomplices to divert 4.4bn baht from a project to construct futsal fields at schools in 19 northeast provinces. The alleged graft took place in 2012. The NACC was required to forward the case to the Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) within 30 days. The OAG then had 180 days determine whether to bring the case before the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions. no action has been taken. In the Thai legal system, one organisation investigates, another prosecutes. The failings of such an arrangement have been pointed out, but not rectified.

In a broader sense, it is also used for similar compounds where Na, Zr and/or Si are replaced by isovalent elements. NASICON compounds have high ionic conductivities, on the order of 10‚àí3 S/cm, which rival those of liquid electrolytes. They are caused by hopping of Na ions among interstitial sites of the NASICON crystal lattice. Properties The crystal structure of NASICON compounds was characterized in 1968. It is a covalent network consisting of ZrO6 octahedra and PO4/SiO4 tetrahedra that share common corners. Sodium ions are located at two types of interstitial positions. They move among those sites through bottlenecks, whose size, and thus the NASICON electrical conductivity, depends on the NASICON composition, on the site occupancy, and on the oxygen content in the surrounding atmosphere. The conductivity decreases for x < 2 or when all Si is substituted for P in the crystal lattice (and vice versa); it can be increased by adding a rare-earth compound to NASICON, such as yttria. NASICON materials can be prepared as single crystals, polycrystalline ceramic compacts, thin films or as a bulk glass called NASIGLAS. Most of them, except NASIGLAS and phosphorus-free Na4Zr2Si3O12, react with molten sodium at 300 ¬∞C, and therefore are unsuitable for electric batteries that use sodium as an electrode. However, a NASICON membrane is being considered for a sodium-sulfur battery where the sodium stays solid. Potential applications The main application envisaged for NASICON materials is as the solid electrolyte in a sodium-ion battery. Some NASICONs exhibit a low thermal expansion coefficient (< 10‚àí6 K‚àí1), which is useful for precision instruments and household ovenware. NASICONs can be doped with rare-earth elements, such as Eu, and used as phosphors. Their electrical conductivity is sensitive to molecules in the ambient atmosphere, a phenomenon that can be used to detect CO2, SO2, NO, NO2, NH3 and H2S gases. Other NASICON applications include catalysis, immobilization of radioactive waste, and sodium removal from water.

Nicholas was a younger son of William IV of Saint Omer, castellan of Saint-Omer in northern France, and Ida of Avesnes. Ida's brother James of Avesnes took part in the Fourth Crusade (1203‚Äì04) and accompanied Boniface of Montferrat in the conquest and partition of Greece in its aftermath. He was rewarded with possessions in Euboea, but was dead by August 1205. Nicholas remained in his native region until ca. 1208, after which he and his brother James came to Greece, where they received a fief at Erimokastro, the site of ancient Thespiae, west of Thebes. According to F. Van Tricht, the fief may have formed part of the Templar possessions that were confiscated ca. 1209 by the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders. In 1210, he was among the signatories of the concordat with the Latin Church at the Second Parliament of Ravennika. Nicholas later married Margaret of Hungary, the widow of Boniface of Montferrat, who died in 1207. It is unclear when the marriage took place: traditional accounts mention that Nicholas died already in 1212 or 1214, but F. Van Tricht dates the marriage to after 1217. With Margaret he had two sons, Bela and William. Bela would marry Bonne de La Roche, the sister of Guy I, the Duke of Athens, become lord of one half of Thebes, and lay the foundations for the rise of the Saint Omer family to a prominent position in Frankish Greece.

The novel won the 2014 Carnegie Medal for children's literature. The Bunker Diary features the story of Linus Weems, a teenager who is captured and imprisoned in a mysterious bunker. In 2014, after the Carnegie Prize win, the book was the focus of controversy due to its depictions of violence and its purported nihilism.  Plot and ending  Teenager Linus Weems wakes up in an underground bunker (having been drugged with chloroform and kidnapped by a stranger). Linus is originally from a wealthy family, but since the death of his mother and subsequent arguments with his father, he had run away from school and been living on the streets. It was there that the stranger was able to kidnap Linus, by posing as a blind man needing assistance. As Linus adjusts to his new surroundings, he finds that the bunker has a kitchen, bathroom and six small bedrooms, but there are also cameras and microphones so that 'the man upstairs' (as Linus calls the kidnapper) can watch his every move. Soon after Linus's arrival, other kidnap victims start being brought down via a lift ‚Äì the lift being the means by which the kidnapper communicates. The first to arrive is nine-year-old Jenny, who forms a close bond with Linus. Jenny successfully convinces the kidnapper to send down food by presenting a polite, handwritten note to 'Him' via a message in the elevator. Soon after, other kidnap victims arrive, but have nothing in common with one another. Anja is a beautiful, smartly-dressed but somewhat selfish woman in her twenties, Bird is an older businessman who gets on well with Anja. There's also Fred, an addict, and Russell, an elderly man with a brain tumor. The group quickly learn that any attempt at escape results in 'punishments' from the kidnapper, such as deafening noise being played, being knocked out with gas and food deliveries stopping or being poisoned. At one point, the kidnapper sends down vodka and drugs, presumably to stop the group from trying to work together effectively. Linus tries to convince everyone to continue co-operating, but his efforts are merely met with hostility and complaints from some of the group. Desperate for escape, Linus attempts to lure 'the man upstairs' into the bunker, but the kidnapper sends down a vicious Doberman in the lift instead. The dog savagely attacks Bird, but is then killed by Fred. Due to this latest escape attempt, the food stops, and Linus resorts to eating insects. Soon after this, the group receives some meat in the lift, and a note saying that whoever kills another will be freed, causing a descent into chaos. The terminally-ill Russell tries to persuade Linus to gain his freedom by killing him or Bird (who is dying of his injuries from the dog-attack), but Linus refuses. Anja is then strangled to death by one of the group ‚Äì the killer is never identified but is strongly presumed to be Bird, whose injuries are causing him to act strangely. The kidnapper continues to play games by sending a note down, falsely implying that Linus committed the murder to create suspicion. Fred accidentally kills Bird in a fight, whilst trying to protect Jenny. Russell then commits suicide. The days continue to pass and the remaining three are left hungry and cold. Eventually, the lift comes down with its doors closed, and doesn't go back up. The three realise that 'the man upstairs' has gone, though they do not know whether he has been killed or has simply abandoned them. The power shuts off, leaving them in darkness and without water. Now weakened and delirious, Fred is killed when he drinks some bleach, after becoming desperate and ill. Linus and Jenny are left alone. Shortly after, Jenny dies in Linus's arms. He reports that she simply 'goes to sleep and doesn't wake up'. Linus '[skins] dry' and eats Jenny's body, rationalising that it's all just meat. It is then implied that Linus also dies, as he writes that 'it doesn't hurt anymore'. The diary abruptly finishes mid-sentence. It ends of on the note with no satisfied ending. No explanation to as what had happened, the point of it all, the identity and ending of said man upstairs, or the fate of them all. Linus then wakes up as he has survived and learns that the goal was to be the last man standing.

While a fraternal relationship existed between Malankara and Persia (Church of the East) in the earlier centuries, closer ecclesiastical ties developed as early as 15th century and endured until the Portuguese colonial invasion of Malabar in 16th century. The Christians who came under the two ancient yet distinct lineages of Malankara (India) and Persia had one factor in common: their Saint Thomas heritage. The Church of the East shared communion with the Great Church (Catholicism and Orthodoxy) until the Council of Ephesus in the 5th century, separating primarily over differences in Christology. The Saint Thomas Christians of Malankara (India) came in contact with Portuguese Catholic missionaries only in the 16th century. Later, after the Oath of Koonan Cross (meaning \\"leaning cross\\") in 1653, the Saint Thomas Christians came in touch with the Syriac Orthodox Church. Though claims have been made that the Saint Thomas Christians of Malankara had close interactions with the Catholic Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church before the 16th century, these assertions lack proof. Timeline of Schisms in Malankara, indicating the extent and duration of Persian influence Early references The celebrated Church historian Eusebius has mentioned in his work that the Alexandrian scholar Pantenus:nl:Pantenus had seen Christians during his visit to India between 180 A. D. and 190 A. D. This account of Eusebius has later been quoted by several historians. According to Eusebius, Pantenus saw people reading the Gospel according to Mathew in Hebrew. Based on this reference by Eusebius, Jerome has recorded the existence of Christians in India during the early centuries of Christian Era. In addition to this, Jerome mentions that Pantenus held debates with Brahmins and philosophers in India. The evangelisation of India is mentioned in a number of ancient works, including the book Acts of Judas Thomas written in Edessa around 180 A. D. in Syriac language, and Didascalia (meaning teachings of the Apostles) written around 250 A. D. Historians have often remarked that the Persians might have received this tradition about the Church in India from India itself. The Chronicle of Seert is a historical document compiled in the Middle Ages. In this Chronicle, the Church in India is mentioned along with the history of Persian Church and the Patriarchs (Catholicoi) of Babylon. It also states that during the reigns of Shahlufa and Papa bar Aggai as the heads of Persian Church, the Persian bishop David of Basra preached the Gospel in India. Some historians' records regarding the participation of Bishop John representing Persia and India as the Bishop of the all of Persia and Greater India in the first Ecumenical Council of Nicaea in 325 A. D. remains a matter of contention among historians. Ishodad was a famous Bible scholar who lived in Persia in the 5th century. In his commentary on the Epistle to Romans, a note is scribbled in the margin that may be translated as: This article is translated by Mar Komai with the help of Daniel, an Indian priest, from Greek to Syriac. This statement reveals the connection between the Indian priest Daniel and the Persian bishop Mar Komai. Persian Immigration The two instances of immigration from Persia to Malankara (India) substantiate the Malankara-Persia connection. The first of these, which occurred in the 4th century, was led by a merchant named Thoma (fondly referred to as Knai Thoma or Knai Thomman by the Christians of Malankara, meaning Thomas of Cana), while the second immigration was led by two Persian bishops, Prod and Sappor in the 9th century. There exists the strong tradition that Thomas of Cana, accompanied by a Persian bishop and seventy two families, reached the ancient port of Kodungallur in India. The history of Knanaya in Malankara is inseparably related to this immigration. In 825 A. D., a group of Persians under the leadership of two Persian bishops Prod (or Proth, also known as Aphroth) and Sappor (also known as Sabrisho)reached Kerala and resided in Quilon. They received great honors from the native ruler known as Sthanu Ravi Varma who bestowed 72 titles and special rights and concessions on them. The king believed that the immigrants who were merchants by profession would boost the economy. Their Church in Quilon was known as Thareesa Pally and the titles were engraved on metal plates known as Thareesa Pally Chepped.  Persian Bishops in Malankara  While some Persian Bishops who traveled to Malankara belonged to different groups of immigrants fleeing persecution, others visited Malankara to provide spiritual administration to the Malankara Nasranis. Niranam GrandhavariNiranam Granthavari (Record of History written during 1770‚Äì1830). Editor Paul Manalil, M.O.C.Publications, Catholicate Aramana, Kottayam. 2002. gives a list (incomplete) of Persian bishops and the year of their visits to Malankara. * Mar Joseph of Uraha (Edessa) (345 A. D.) * Mar Sabor (825 A. D.) * Mar Aphroth (825 A. D.) * Mar Yohannan (988 A. D.) * Mar Joseph (1056 A. D.) * Mar Yacob (1122 A. D.) * Mar Joseph (1221 A. D.) * Mar David (1285 A. D.) * Mar Yabaloha (1407 A. D.) * Mar Abraham (1545 A. D.) * Mar Gabriel (1706 A. D.)  Persian Church Records  Several evidences are available from the historical records of Persian Church and letters of Persian bishops which corroborate the Malankara-Persian relation. In the 5th century, Mar Mana, the Persian bishop of Rev Ardashir recorded that while sending his theological works and the works and translations of other Persian bishops to various places, they were sent to India as well. In the 6th century during the reign of Persian emperor Khosrau II, bishop Marutha reached Persia as the delegate of the Roman Emperor and visited the Persian Patriarch Sabrisho I (594‚Äì604). It is recorded that during this visit, the Patriarch presented bishop Marutho with fragrant spices and other special gifts which he had received from India. Two letters from Persian Patriarch Ishoyahb III to the Metropolitan bishop of Fars between 650 and 660 A. D. show that the Indian Christians were under the jurisdiction of the Persian Patriarchate. In the 7th century, Fars was an eparchy (ecclesiastical province) in the Persian Church with Rev Ardashir as its capital. At that time, Metropolitan bishop Simon of Rev Ardashir was in charge of the affairs of the Church of India. However, a situation arose in which the bishop became hostile to the Patriarch, resulting in excommunication. In his letter, the Patriarch reprimands the bishop and complains that because of the opposition of the bishop, it was impossible to tend to the spiritual needs of the faithful in India. The Patriarch adds that the Indians were cut off from the Patriarchate and the annual offertory given to the Patriarch by the Indians was no longer given. Following this, Patriarch Ishoyahb III issued an encyclical releasing the Church of India from the jurisdiction of Fars eparchy and appointed a Metropolitan Bishop for India. According to the canons of Persian Church in the medieval centuries, the bishop of India came tenth in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, followed by the bishop of China. The title of the Metropolitan bishop of India was the Metropolitan and Gate of all India. During the reign of Patriarch Timothy the Great (780‚Äì823) also, the Patriarch released the Church of India from the authority of the bishop of Fars, placing it under his direct jurisdiction. Historians refer to two letters written by Patriarch Timothy with regard to the Church of India. The first letter contains guidelines for the election of Metropolitans. The letter demands that the acknowledgement of the Patriarch must be obtained after the people selected bishops based on the guidelines set by the Patriarch, before requesting the acknowledgement of the Emperor. In the second letter addressed to the Archdeacon of Malankara, the Patriarch mentions some violations of canon in the Church of India. The Patriarch also demands that bishops should abstain from entering wedlock and consuming meat. While writing about the journeys of Nestorian missionaries during his reign, Timothy I himself says (in Letter 13) that a number of monks go across the sea to India with nothing but a staff and a beggar's bag. In the Persian Church, the bishops were supposed to report to the Patriarch every year. However, Patriarch Theodosius (853‚Äì858) suggested that the bishops of distant places like India and China need to report only once every six years, owing to the great distance. In 1129, in response to the request of the Church of India, the Persian Patriarch Eliya II sent bishop Mar Yohannan to Malabar (Kerala, India). Mar Yohannan reached Kodungallur and gave the Church spiritual leadership from there. In 1490, a three-member delegation of the Christians of Malankara left for Baghdad with a petition to the Patriarch requesting him to appoint a Metropolitan Bishop for them. One of them perished on the way. The remaining two, named George and Joseph, were ordained to priesthood by Patriarch Shem øon IV Basidi. The Patriarch selected two monks from the monastery of Mar Augen and consecrated them as bishops Mar Thoma and Mar John. These bishops accompanied the two priests on their return to India. Bishop Mar John died shortly after. Later, Mar Thoma and the priest Joseph returned to Baghdad. Patriarch Eliya V, who ascended the throne in 1502, sent three bishops, namely Mar Yabalaha, Mar Yakob and Mar Denaha to Malankara. By the time they reached Malankara, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama had already set foot in Kerala. The three bishops were detained by the Portuguese. Few years later, Patriarch Abdisho IV Maron sent bishop Abraham to Malankara. Mar Abraham was also imprisoned by the Portuguese. As a result of the injuries suffered at the hands of the Portuguese, Mar Abraham died in 1597. Thus, the authority of Persian bishops in Malankara reached its termination. Testimonials of Travelers The 6th century Gallo-Roman historian Gregory of Tours has recorded the trips of Theodore, a Persian monk, to India on several occasions where the latter visited the tomb of Apostle St. Thomas and an adjoining monastery. Near the end of the 6th century, the Persian scholar Bodha has recorded his visit to India where he held discussions with Indian religious scholars in Sanskrit language. Cosmas Indicopleustes, the Alexandrian traveler visited India during 520‚Äì525. Later, he wrote a book titled Christian Topography in which he mentions the Churches of Persia, India, Ceylon etc. Cosmas states the existence of Christians in Malabar, where pepper grows. Cosmas also records that there were Christians at Kalyana (Kalyan in Mumbai, India) with a bishop appointed from Persia. The traveler tries to emphasize the spread of Christianity in all these places. Marco Polo, who visited Kerala in 1295 has recorded that he saw Nestorian Christians there. A lectionary compiled in 1301 in Syriac language at Kodungallur in Kerala is kept in the collection of Syriac manuscripts in the Vatican Library. In that lectionary, it is stated that it was compiled during the time of Nestorian Patrirch Yahballaha III and Mar Yakob, the Metropolitan on the throne of St. Thomas in India at Kodungallur. The Persian Church fathers Nestorius, Theodore and Deodore are also mentioned in this lectionary. In an Arabic document written near the end of 14th century titled Churches and Monasteries in Egypt and its surroundings, it is mentioned that pilgrims visit the tomb of Apostle St. Thomas in Mylapore, India. In the same document, it is stated that a Church in the name of the Mother of God exists in Kullam (modern day Kollam in Kerala) and that the Christians there are pro-Nestorians. Persian Stone Crosses in Malankara The Persian stone crosses in Malankara are eternal witnesses to Malankara-Persia connection. At present, five such Persian crosses exist, two at Kottayam (Knanite) Knanaya Jacobite Valiya pally (meaning greater church), one each at Mylapore St. Thomas Mount, Kadamattom St. George Orthodox Church and Muttuchira Catholic Church. These crosses are chiseled on stone and embedded in the walls of these churches. Some writings in ancient Persian language are also engraved near these crosses. The central panel, which contains the figure of the cross with its symbolic ornaments, is enclosed by an arch that has an inscription in the Pahlavi script of Sassanian Persia. Decisions of the Synod of Diamper The infamous Synod of Diamper was a calculated move towards separating the Malankara Church from Persian connection and bringing it under the Pope of Rome. This was the aim of Portuguese missionaries since the beginning of their missionary works in India. Their efforts culminated in the synod of Diamper in 1599. Aleixo de Menezes, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Goa, who visited the Churches of Malankara prior to convening the Synod, had expressed his indignation over the prayer for the Patriarch of Persia amid the Divine Liturgy in those Churches. He strictly admonished that the Pope was the general primate (Catholicos) of the Church and in his stead, no one else should be prayed for. Several canons of the Synod including canons 12, 17, 19 etc. were solely aimed at obstructing and obliterating Malankara-Persian relation and establishing a relationship with Rome instead. In spite of almost sixteen centuries of Persian connection, a majority of the Christians of Malankara became associated with the Roman Catholic Church and Western Syriac Church of Antioch (Syriac Orthodox). At present, only a very small minority of Christians in Malankara (numbering around 50,000) are in direct connection with the Nestorians (Assyrian Church of the East).:nl:Chaldean Syrian Church Liturgical Language During the early centuries of Christian Era, the population to the east of Tigris‚ÄìEuphrates river system was under Persian rule, while the population to its west was under Roman rule. The Syrian people spread over the two empires used the Syriac language independently by developing distinct transformations from basic Es·π≠rangƒìlƒÅ. The form of Syriac which was developed in Persia resembled Es·π≠rangƒìlƒÅ more closely, and is referred to as Eastern Syriac, Chaldean Syriac or Nestorian Syriac. Until the 17th century, the Church of India used this dialect. Following the Synod of Diamper in 1599 and the Oath of Coonan Cross in 1653, they came in direct contact with the West Syriac tradition and hence with the West Syriac dialect of the language. Until then, the Liturgy of Nestorius, who is considered a saint by the Chaldean Church and anathematized by the Western Syriac tradition, was popular in Malankara. Gregorios Abdal Jaleel, who was the first West Syrian bishop to visit Malankara, faced severe opposition from the people of Malankara for following West Syrian liturgy, and was asked to follow the East Syrian liturgy, which the people referred to as old liturgy. Since the 17th century, efforts were made by the visiting bishops of West Syriac tradition to establish the use of western dialect in liturgy in Malankara. Written in a more roundly form, this dialect is known as Western Syriac, Maronite Syriac or Jacobite Syriac. As both these forms are indistinguishable in terms of grammar and meaning, they differ only in the shape of letters and pronunciation. Even though the Western Syriac was introduced in the Malankara Church in the 17th century, its use was still greatly eclipsed by the use of Eastern Syriac until the 19th century, as shown by the pronunciations in the Eastern Syriac way which have transcended into the daily usage and liturgical translations of the Christians of Malankara. This is exemplified by the pronunciation of words like Sleeba, Kablana, Qurbana, Kasa, Thablaitha etc. (instead of Sleebo, Kablono, Qurbono, Kaso, Thablaitho as in the Western dialect) which has remained unchanged through the centuries. Even the letters written by the primate of Malankara Church, Malankara Metropolitan Mar Dionysius, the Great (+1808) were in Eastern Syriac.. It was only in 1788 that Mar Dionysius, the Great agreed to replace East Syrian Liturgy with West Syrian Liturgy, a decision that was approved by the Malankara Palliyogam (assembly of parish representatives) through the historical document Puthiyacavu PadiyolaNiranam Granthavari (Record of History written during 1770‚Äì1830).

Life Dunkin was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1753, as the eldest son of John Dunkin of Bushfoot, County Antrim;Register of Admissions to the Middle Temple, p. 341 Later he was described as from Clogher, County Antrim. He was High Sheriff of Antrim in 1777.High Sheriffs of the County of Antrim, Ulster Journal of Archaeology Second Series, Vol. 11, No. 2 (Apr., 1905) , pp. 78-83, at p. 82. Published by: Ulster Archaeological Society. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20566218 Although he had inherited an estate, he encumbered it with debt, and went to Calcutta to practise as a barrister. In October 1781 Dunkin was mentioned as on the way to India in a letter from Edmund Burke to Lord George Macartney, two of his friends. There he was a friend of William Hickey. He lived a bachelor life, sharing accommodation with Stephen Cassan, another Irish barrister. In 1788 he set off to go to England in search of a judicial appointment in Calcutta, sailing to Europe in December on the Phoenix under Captain Gray. Dunkin returned to Bengal on the Phoenix in August 1791; he had been appointed a member of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William. being knighted in March of that year. The appointment was later attributed to the influence of Henry Dundas. Dunkin had in fact obtained a reluctant support for it from Lord Thurlow. His senior colleague on the court, Robert Chambers, did not welcome it, regarding Dunkin as suspect; further Dunkin and Hickey were allies in opposition to Chambers. Hickey's accounts of Chambers in his memoirs, in relation to Dunkin on the court, have been called partisan and misleading, in particular in relation to a bazaar case where John Hyde was brought from his sickbed in 1796 as a supporting vote by Chambers against Dunkin. Dunkin resigned from the post in 1797, being replaced by John Royds. He had a house in Portman Square, London, where Thomas Reynolds knew him as one of a set of wealthy returnees from India; and died at The Polygon, Southampton in 1807. Works When Sir William Jones died in 1794, Dunkin wrote a Latin epitaph, used on his tomb in Calcutta. An English paraphrase was later made by Eyles Irwin. Family Elizabeth Blacker (1739‚Äì1822), wife of William Dunkin, portrait by Thomas Gainsborough Dunkin married Elizabeth or Eliza Blacker (1739‚Äì1822), daughter of William Blacker (1709‚Äì1783), in 1764. Their eldest daughter Letitia married Sir Francis Workman Macnaghten, having a family of 16 children, among them William Hay Macnaghten. When Dunkin clashed with William Burroughs, attorney-general in Bengal from 1792, Francis Macnaghten tried to challenge Burroughs to a duel, and then to have him disbarred. Through the marriage, the Macnaghtens acquired the Dunkin family house at Bushmills.Bushmills Conservation Area (PDF) Of Dunkin's other children, his daughter Jane married Richard William Wake, son of Sir William Wake, 8th Baronet, and his daughter Rachel married John Bladen Taylor, the Member of Parliament for , as her second husband, the first being George Elliott of Bengal. The youngest daughter, Matilda, married Valentine Conolly, son of William Conolly. Hickey mentions two sons. One, Edward, came to Bengal with his father in 1791, in his late teens but suffered from fits. According to Hickey, he returned to Europe and died young.Hickey, Memoirs IV p. 45.

Plot Frank Duncan (Barry), a shrewd oil driller from Galveston, Texas, conceives a plan to sneakily siphon millions of dollars' worth of oil from the oil fields and sell it as his own. He goes through nightclub singer Zoe Crane (Hale) to insinuate himself with a Houston mobster, Paul Atlas (Arnold) to get financing for his scheme. Atlas tells right-hand man Gordon Shay privately that he plans to double-cross Duncan as soon as the money's in hand. Chris Barker, a gunman, robs Duncan and intends to murder him, but Duncan is able to push Barker off an oil rig to his death. Duncan tries to make a getaway with the help of true- blue girlfriend Madge, but the hard-hearted Zoe steals his money and lies to Madge that Duncan has betrayed her. A pair of Atlas's thugs snatch Zoe, take her money and toss her from a moving car. Shay is killed, but before Duncan can get away, the cops close in on him and he's forced to surrender.

Originally set for the lead role was acclaimed character actor Lee J. Cobb. But Cobb suffered a heart attack on May 8 after filming an exhausting fight sequence, in part due to the heat in Texas, where the scene was shot. Cobb was not able to work for the three more days of location scenes on the schedule. Director William Castle, who resembled Cobb, doubled for him in these scenes. Ten weeks later Cobb had recovered enough to return to work. However he then suffered another heart attack and had to be replaced. Cobb's part had to be recast and according to Castle Katzman \\"insisted on a relatively new actor in pictures - Gene Barry, a fine actor, but as unlike Lee J. Cobb as anyone could be.\\" Castle says footage of himself and Cobb remains in the final film. The film's sets were designed by the art director Paul Palmentola.

It is one of Denmark's oldest estates and manors, documented as early as the 1330s. Between 1815-1938, it was known as Hardenberg. History and architecture The three-winged building stands on a narrow, rectangular mound surrounded by a moat. The original stone house from 1490 was extended by statesman Mogens G√∏ye with three new wings, forming an enclosed courtyard. A tower was added on the west side. In 1631, Palle Rosenkrantz built an extra storey on the north wing and an octagonal tower on the southeast corner. The south wing was destroyed by fire in 1689 and never rebuilt. The entire complex was renovated in 1780. From 1815 to 1838, Krenkerup was known as Hardenberg. In 1731, the Reventlows established a family property consisting of Krenkerup, Rosenlund and N√∏rreg√•rd which in 1815 became the countyship of Hardenberg-Reventlow, including the subsidiary estates of Nielstrup, S√¶byholm and Christiansdal. It was dissolved in 1924. Covering an area of , the estate is one of the largest in Denmark. Today it is an active agricultural concern and also houses a brewery.

It is run as a non- departmental public body with an office in Nottingham and about 120 staff. It provides support to 19,000 disabled people with the highest levels of need at a cost of about ¬£320 million. It operates as an independent discretionary trust funded by the Department for Work and Pensions and is managed by a board of trustees. Its aim is to combat social exclusion on the grounds of disability. The money is generally used to enable disabled people to live in their own homes and to pay for care, and in particular to employ personal assistants. Many of the beneficiaries would otherwise have to move to residential care homes. In December 2010 the Government announced the closure of the Fund to new applicants, and in December 2012, following a consultation on the future of the Fund, it was announced that the Fund would be closed permanently from April 2015. The Government claimed that Local Authorities could meet the same outcomes as the ILF and proposed transfer for existing ILF recipients to their Local Authorities. In May 2014 The Court of Appeal, in the case of Bracking and others v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions found that the Department for Work and Pensions' decision to close the Fund was not lawful, overturning the High Court decision of April 2013. It decided that the Department had not complied with the Public Sector Equality Duties imposed by section 149 of the Equality Act 2010. The Court agreed that documents which the Minister, Esther McVey, had seen in the run up to her decision proved that \\"the Minister did not receive a sufficient understanding of the true threat to independent living for ILF users posed by the proposal to close the fund\\". Lord Justice McCombe said ‚Äòthere is simply not the evidence ‚Ä¶ to demonstrate to the court that a focussed regard was had to the potentially very grave impact upon individuals in this group of disabled persons, within the context of a consideration of the statutory requirements for disabled people as a whole'. The Government has announced that it will not appeal against this decision so the Fund will continue for the time being. Its future was the subject of a Westminster Hall debate on 18 June 2014. The Department has carried out a new equality impact assessment to justify the closure.

Surveys reveal that petty corruption has decreased significantly throughout the country, while high-level corruption has increased. Corruption is considered an obstacle for doing business in Vietnam, and the use of facilitation payments are widespread when dealing with frontline civil servants. Corruption has moved up the political agenda in Vietnam, and the legal framework for tackling corruption is now better developed. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 107th place out of 180 countries.  Defining corruption  Prior to any discourse on Corruption and its related components, it is important to ascertain its definition from various perspectives. The often-cited definition of corruption comes from Transparency International. They define corruption as ‚Äòthe abuse of entrusted power for personal gain‚Äù, going further to elaborate on 3 categories of corruption: Grand, Petty and Political Corruption. They define: Grand corruption as ‚ÄòThe abuse of high-level power that benefits the few at the expense of the many, and causes serious and widespread harm to individuals and society‚Äô, Petty corruption as ‚ÄòEveryday abuse of entrusted power by public officials in their interactions with ordinary citizens, who often are trying to access basic goods or services‚Äô, and Political corruption as ‚Äò Manipulation of policies, institutions and rules of procedure in the allocation of resources and financing by political decision makers, who abuse their position to sustain their power, status and wealth‚Äô. The more recent 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International ranked Vietnam at 107 out of 180 countries. While it has improved over the years since the Doi Moi reforms, corrupt practices remain evident in the business landscape. Corruption in Vietnam occurs at various levels of government, and even within private organisations. Segon & Booth noted that at least 30% of public and civil servants have indicated that they are willing to take a bribe. The work by Segon and Booth was centered around managerial perspectives of expatriate managers who have been working in Vietnam for a few years. Much of the data they gathered from these exchanges revolved around the corrupt practices that were observed within Vietnamese companies and the public sector. Dr. Segon is an Associate Professor with the CQ University in Australia, who was working as an Ethics and CSR specialist for a western business consultancy at the time this article was published, thus his work appears centered around a western perspective on the practices the west defines as corrupt, as one may expect from a business consultant. This business/profit centered approach was also adopted by Coffey, an international consultancy that counts the UK Department of International Development among its clients, which also commissioned the study on the state of corruption in Vietnam as cited in this entry. A survey of businesses in various sectors by Maruichi and Abe showed that companies can expect anywhere between US$50 to US$500 to obtain required permits, licenses and business registration. Coffey postulates that this corruption erodes the positive consequences of Vietnam's economic growth and development. The Vietnamese Government had implemented an anti-corruption law in 2005, and established the Office of the Central Steering Committee for Anti-Corruption in 2006 as part of their efforts to combat corruption. MartiniMartini, M. (2012). Overview of corruption and anti-corruption in Vietnam. Anti-Corruption Resource Centre. Retrieved from: https://www.u4.no/publications/overview-of- corruption-and-anti-corruption-in-vietnam.pdf notes that while the law and legal framework was lauded as one of the best in Asia to combat corruption, it was also reported that the effects of the Anti-Corruption efforts have been limited due to the weak enforcement of laws and lack of information regarding the work of Anti-Corruption agencies. It is observed that these definitions, frameworks and benchmarks are from western or western-sponsored sources and organizations. Martini's work was part of a report by Transparency International, where she worked at the time of this report. Hence, her statements in the report are likely bound to the constraints put upon her by the organization that has its own set definition. Hence, it is therefore equally important that the Vietnamese definition of corruption be examined as well. The Vietnamese state, through its Anti-Corruption Law passed in 2005, defined corruption as ‚Äòacts committed by persons with positions and/or powers of abusing such positions and/or powers for self-seeking interests‚Äô. Corrupt acts stated in the law include, but are not limited to, (1) Taking and/or offering bribes, (2) Abusing Powers while performing tasks or duties for self- seeking interests, and (3) Taking advantage of positions to influence people for self-seeking interests. At the societal level, the Vietnamese seem to have a looser definition of corruption. Sato notes that the lay citizen in Vietnam views corruption as a customary practice needed to maintain harmony within the community and support their shared interests. In other words, corruption is seen as a necessary evil to get things done. This view is supported by Gillespie who mentioned that locals from both elite and common circles view accept some level of official misconduct. It can be seen that western definitions of corruption are aligned with the Vietnamese State's definition at the macro level. Vietnam ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption in 2009, committing to implement measures to combat corruption. A UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC)UNODC (2014). Country Review Report of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime. report of noted Vietnam's partial implementation of the different articles of the convention, such as the toughening of bribery and embezzlement laws. News outlets have also reported about Vietnam stepping up in its Anti-Corruption drive, arresting former high-ranking officials on charges relating to corruption, though critics have indicated that these arrests could be politically motivated. Despite the progress, from the UNODC report that Vietnam has made various exceptions, such as by not criminalizing bribery in the private sector. This may indicate that while there may be some alignment on certain aspects of corruption with the international actors, the Vietnamese government understands what makes Vietnamese society thrive. It would appear that the Vietnamese citizens understand and view corruption differently. Hence, there exists a mismatch of paradigms that could be one of the sources for the misunderstandings. Neither the Vietnamese nor the international actors have been able to paint an accurate picture on the state of corruption in Vietnam, because what western foreigners may perceive as corruption can be perceived as ‚Äòpatronage‚Äô or clientalism by the local Vietnamese, which Sato mentioned is part of their culture. This mismatch is exacerbated by rankings such as the Corruption Perceptions Index. This Index, founded and managed by Transparency International, is one that many around the world use as the basis for their academic or professional work. It is supported by various western countries and western-based international Non-Profits and organisations, who also serve as the donors to Transparency International. While popular among scholars, the Index itself does have some limitations. One of them is that the definitions, benchmarks and methods employed by the Corruption Perceptions Index is based on western perspectives and values, which may have a varied perspective on the issue of corruption, its causes and consequences compared to other non-western nations it assesses. Another limitation is the Index only looks at public sector corruption, thus does not paint a comprehensive picture of a country's corruption due to the absence of data from other sectors. Finally, the index itself is based on ‚Äòperceptions‚Äô of corruption. Kaufman, Kray & MastruzziKaufmann, D., A. Kraay and M. Mastruzzi (2006): ‚ÄúMeasuring Corruption: Myths and Realities‚Äù, Development Outreach, Vol. September 2006, pp. 124 ‚Äì 137 mentioned in their work that one of the ways which corruption is being measured is through gathering ‚Äòinformed views of relevant stakeholders‚Äô such as firms, NGOs, individuals, public officials and donors from both within Vietnam and abroad. Kaufman, Kray & Mastruzzi also acknowledged in their work that there can be no precise measure of corruption, regardless of whether subjective or objective indicators were used. This suggests since the data collected is largely subjective and inaccurate, it could impact the accuracy of scholarly studies based on this data. As there is no universally accepted definition, understanding or measurement of corruption, it is therefore difficult to prescribe how corrupt a country is. Not all countries in the world, such as Vietnam, subscribe to the Transparency International definition or benchmark for corruption, although its arbitrary definition and benchmark overlaps with the Transparency International in some areas.  Vietnam: a hotbed for corruption?  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a fast- developing country of about 96 million people, nestled near the heart of Southeast Asia. Vietnam today is an attractive location for doing business. Over the course of the last 2 decades, Vietnam's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has seen a meteoric rise, from about US$131 billion in 1997 to about US$647 billion in 2017, pointing to a substantial middle class with significant purchasing power. With globalization and the internet, the Vietnamese are exposed to global trends and thus, creates a demand for foreign goods. This makes Vietnam an attractive market for consumer goods. Vietnam also has a youthful population, with a report by the OECD Development CentreOECD Development Centre (2017), ‚ÄúYouth Well-being Policy Review of Viet Nam‚Äù, EU- OECD Youth Inclusion Project, Paris. stating that out of Vietnam's overall population of about 90.4 million people, about 70% of them are in the working ages of 15 to 64 years old. This indicates a youthful and vibrant workforce that can participate in a variety of professions, such as farmers in agricultural primary industries, heavy manufacturing and food processing in secondary industries, and provision of services in tertiary industries. Vietnam's close proximity to East Asian nations such as Japan, China and Korea allow for the seamless movement of services and goods to some of its largest investors and markets. Along with its abundance of its natural resources, these provide a multitude of reasons for foreign businesses to base themselves in Vietnam, hire Vietnamese workers and sell to the Vietnamese market. Today, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Vietnam stands at about US$13 billion, and comes in the form of investments in Manufacturing & Processing, and Real Estate industries. In sum, the reasons for foreigners to do business in Vietnam: (1) Stellar record of economic growth that gave rise to a burgeoning middle class, (2) Youthful workforce, (3) Close proximity to East Asian nations and (4) Abundance of natural resources. However, intertwined with this success story are the accusations of corruption by various actors, both from within and outside of Vietnam. Conventional thought points out that corruption slows down economic growth, diminishes state power and marginalizes the poor, among many other things. Despite the bleak portrayal of corruption, Vietnam is a nation that sees an upward trajectory for growth and development, with no indication of slowing down. Subsequent segments will examine a variety of perspectives on different sides of the discourse in relation to the themes of Bribery and Nepotism.  Bribery and its effects on Vietnamese society  Transparency International has defined bribery as ‚ÄòThe offering, promising, giving, accepting or soliciting of an advantage as an inducement for an action which is illegal, unethical or a breach of trust‚Äô. Examples of these advantages can include gifts, rewards, donations and favours. Bribes are the most commonly utilised mode of corruption which is prevalent in public and private sectors as well as Vietnamese society. The act of bribery causes negative repercussions for the country's economic growth by making companies less competitive due to the payment of ‚Äòinformal costs‚Äô to keep the business going. Monetary forms of bribery In 2011, 44% of Vietnamese have reportedly paid a bribe, commonly as a form of ‚Äògrease money‚Äô to expedite or fulfill basic tasks or services.Bai, Jie & Jayachandran, Seema & Malesky, Edmund & A. Olken, Benjamin. (2017). Firm Growth and Corruption: Empirical Evidence from Vietnam. The Economic Journal. 10.1111/ecoj.12560. Bribery can also be found in the higher education sector. McCornacMccornac, Dennis. (2015). Corruption in Vietnamese Higher Education. International Higher Education. 10.6017/ihe.2008.50.7992. mentioned that corrupt practices are the norm in Vietnamese higher education, citing the low salary of teachers as a key reason why the practice of bribing to gain entry into educational institutions and to cheat in the examinations became commonplace. He also stated that the bribes were not only monetary, but also come in the form of expensive gifts such as phones and expensive bags. Anh, Nguyen & Tran-amAnh, Ngoc & Nguyen, Ngoc & Tran-Nam, Binh. (2016). Corruption and economic growth, with a focus on Vietnam. Crime, Law and Social Change. 65. 10.1007/s10611-016-9603-0. determined through their study that corruption hampers economic growth, though they have noted in the same study that corruption is positively correlated to human capital, which is also positively correlated to economic growth. Up to this point, Coffey, Anh, Nguyen & Tran-am and McCornac have clearly illustrated that corruption brings about negative effects to the country's economy and is detrimental to the nation's education sector. The study by Anh, Nguyen & Tran-am was sponsored by the UK Department for International Development and was presented at the 2014 Vietnam Economists Annual Meeting to foreign economists, scholars and students. The authors were also western educated in the area of economics, which suggests that the study was based on a western economics perspective of corruption, consistent with earlier definitions by Transparency International. McCornac was also similarly educated in Economics and thus, his study was also based on an economics perspective. McCornac has previously taught in Vietnamese universities for about 10 years and in a related study published in 2008, he conducted informal surveys and interviews with undergraduate students, faculty members and university administrators, many of whom shared instances where they personally observed situations of corruption in the form of gift-giving and aiding to cheat. There are, however, scholars who think otherwise. LeffLeff, N.H. (1964). Economic development through bureaucratic corruption. American behavioral scientist, 8(3), 8-14. stated that bribery is needed in the developing world to reduce rigidities that inhibit investments and economic growth. Corruption, or more specifically bribes in this case, would help companies reduce the amount of uncertainty because bribes enable the companies to control and dictate the actions of government officials they deal with. Though Leff's work is dated, he basically provided a reason why ‚Äògrease money‚Äô is needed in Vietnam, in response to Coffey. In a more recent study, LuiLui, F.T. (1985). An equilibrium queuing model of bribery. The journal of political economy, 760-781. argued that paying bribes could allow customers to achieve ‚Äòsocial optimal equilibrium‚Äô, where after factoring in other associated costs such as waiting, it may be more cost-effective to pay the bribe and allow the company to continue its profit-generating work. Lui and Leff's main argument is that bribes help move things along, especially if the institutions of the state are corrupt or unable to police itself. While their arguments seem logical, I find them too simplistic because they do not take into account the intentionality of the officials being bribed, as they can decide the bribe amount arbitrarily or even add on more obstacles to extract additional payment. Hence, there is no sustained reduction of uncertainty for businesses, who could continuously need to pay bribes of varying amounts which could lead to higher operating costs and less competitiveness. On McCornac's article regarding corruption in the higher education sector, his account of teachers accepting bribes in exchange for helping students cheat is clearly a negative case of corruption. The practice of ‚Äòbribing ‚Äòor paying your way for admission into university is not a phenomenon unique to Vietnam. As an Associate Professor in a community college based in the US, he would have been aware that within the US itself, there is a longstanding practice of ‚Äòpaying for a place in US universities‚Äô through donations as soon as or even before the student was admitted. This practice is usually only done by affluent families, which seems to mirror what McCornac mentioned about buying university admission in Vietnam. While it can be argued that donations go to the university while bribes go to the individual, the effects of this practice are the same, less qualified candidates gain entry while more qualified students may be deprived of admission. Non-monetary forms of bribery In Vietnam, business transactions may not only take place within the confines of the office. Much of these can spillover after hours, where businessmen may host their prospective clients for social activities or ‚Äòbusiness drinking‚Äô, which is aimed at cajoling them into finalizing a business deal. These activities usually involve drinking at nightspots, where Kimberly Kay HoangHoang, K,K. (2014). Competing technologies of embodiment: pan-Asian modernity and third World dependency in Vietnam‚Äôs Contemporary sex industry. GENDER & SOCIETY, Vol. 28 No. 4, August 2014 513‚Äì536 DOI: 10.1177/0891243214523122 noted that a substantial number of business deals in Vietnam which contributed to its economy have been facilitated through such drinking sessions. According to Horton & Rydstorm,Horton, P. & Rydstorm, H. (2011). Heterosexual Masculinity in Contemporary Vietnam: Privileges, Pleasures, and Protests. Men and Masculinities 14(5) 542-564. DOI: 10.1177/1097184X11409362 what also usually accompanies these sessions is the presence of sex workers who would be offered to the business clients as an additional incentive for closing a deal. This view is also supported by Kimberly Kay Hoang, an associate professor from the University of Chicago who spent about a year, between June 2009 and August 2010 undercover at Ho Chi Minh city's Khong Sao bar and other similar places to observe the dynamics of the different stakeholders of these nightspots. She observed during her research while serving as a hostess and bartender that businessmen from Vietnam's top finance, real estate and trading companies would be engaged in sex for business purposes, spending anywhere between US$1000 to 2000 per night out on their prospects to encourage them to close business deals. The Anti- Corruption laws of several western countries, including the US, the UK and Germany, have given Bribery a very broad definition, but the main idea is essentially that bribery can take the form of both money and services which includes but is not limited to, as DaoDao Le, T. (2011). Bribery offences under Vietnamese criminal law in comparison with Swedish and Australian criminal law. Lund University. a law scholar from Hanoi, stated in his comparative analysis of Vietnamese and Swedish laws, sexual services. Hence, from the western legal perspective, social drinking and the purchase of sex for their clients in this instance can be seen as a form of Bribery, where the host seeks to influence the outcome of the business deal by buying the prospective customer alcoholic drinks and showing them a good time. Hooker (2008), a professor of Business ethics from Carnegie Mellon, supports this view by mentioning in his business article that western businesses view bribes as problematic as it makes people abandon established rules and procedures which govern the system. Both Hoang and Horton & Rydstorm noted that the purchase of sex and drinks for business contemporaries was another way of projecting masculinity which correlates to one's financial status, for which financial prowess is a trait that prospective clients and partners look out for as a sign of assurance. Going out for drinking and engaging sex workers is not merely a means to relax and seek gratification, but also a way to assess the suitability of a prospective business partner. Hence, the intent to bribe their clients through non-tangible means of gratification may have been a secondary reason to, according to Hoang, the showcase of Vietnamese women as symbols of the nation's economic progress which would engender confidence in their prospective business partners and clients of the benefits on investing in Vietnam. On the subject of intent, Dao notes that according to Vietnamese criminal law, there needs to be ‚Äòdirect intent‚Äô to bribe someone and an awareness of the wrongful nature of bribery. In other words, the person needs to have unequivocally intended to bribe someone and is fully aware that Bribery is an offence yet still commits it. Similarly, the person receiving the bribe also needs to be aware that they are receiving an unwarranted advantage or gratification. Further on the perspective of Vietnamese law on bribery, Dao, also notes that Vietnamese law views the giving and/or receiving of ‚Äòpurely intangible values‚Äô does not constitute as bribery on basis that, in the case of public officials, the exercise of public duties can only be distorted by the receiving or giving of material benefits. Dao's legal perspective coupled with the research findings of Hoang and Horton & Rydstorm illustrates the local perspective of non- monetary forms of bribery, which suggests that the social activities of business drinking and sexual services do not constitute as acts of bribery. In 2017, Vietnam announced that it would be revising its penal code on forms of bribery to include the receiving of non-material gratification such as sexual services, with their timeline projected for implementation to be sometime in 2018.  Effects of nepotism and cronyism  While different in the strictest definition, Nepotism and Cronyism have similar characteristics, which are about favoritism based on acquaintances and familiar relationships by exploiting power and authority to provide a job or favour to a family member or friend, even though he or she may not be qualified or deserving. Nepotism and cronyism are mechanisms seen to promote incompetence at the expense of the organization. VuVu, L. (2015). Public Diplomacy: Why is it Rudimentary yet Relevant to Vietnam‚Äôs Politics? Asian Politics & Policy‚ÄîVolume 7, Number 3‚ÄîPages 395‚Äì411 mentioned that for high raking government positions, nepotism is typically an underlying criterion for selection. Hence, this would put the competence and qualifications of these people into question. It has also been reported that Vietnamese state officials have secured contracts for their family members and close acquaintances, misusing their authority in the process. The award of contracts to family members and acquaintances who may not be the best people to effectively execute the job may end up incurring cost overruns or delays, which would affect the people which the contracted services are meant for. Despite the negative connotations associated with Nepotism, there are scholars who have presented the benefits that Nepotism can contribute to economic growth. Nguyen, Lee, Mujtaba and RuijsNguyen, Lee, Mujtaba & Ruijs. Cross-Culture Management: An Examination on Task, Relationship and Work Overload Stress Orientations of Dutch and Vietnamese. International Journal of Asian Business and Information Management, 4(4), 1-21, October‚ÄìDecember 2013 conducted a culture study of Vietnam and found that its society has a collectivist culture, which emphasizes strong ties and cohesive groups that looks after their members in return for their loyalty. Hence, a person of power and position may see it as his responsibility to look after his family and associates through the provision of such opportunities. Stinchfield and GavorStinchfield & Gavor (2013). Towards a theory of corruption, nepotism, and new venture creation in developing countries. Int. J. of Entrepreneurship and Small Business. 18. 1 - 14. 10.1504/IJESB.2013.050749. are an associate professor specializing in entrepreneurship and a student of business studies respectively from the Frank & Marshall College in the US. Their research interests, besides entrepreneurship, include corruption, social, and environmental issues. They noted that in countries where there is low trust in state institutions such as Vietnam, recruiting family members and close acquaintances into new business ventures was a way of getting a compliant pool of staff who would support the company founder's corrupt practices, such as using grease money to remove bureaucratic rigidities. Recruitment of family members ensures that the benefits that the company reaps also stays within the family, where they can then continue to build on that wealth. Scholars have presented Nepotism in the public sector as detrimental to the nation as a whole, but some of these scholars have also noted that in western countries such as the US, there are instances where its leaders have put their own family members and acquaintances into positions of power, in return for support typically during election campaigning, characteristic of a Patron-clientalism relationship. Lewis, a Professor in Political Science, notes that it is commonplace for the US President, upon election into office, to put his supporters, campaign workers and party officials who have helped the president get elected, into positions of power. Using the term ‚ÄòPatronage‚Äô, he stated how they are put into public positions of power and prestige because of their political connections, despite some of them being less qualified than other possible candidates within the same agency. He cited the George W Bush administration as a case study in his work, and mentioned that political appointees typically get placed in agencies that are already aligned with the President's agenda and where the political appointees‚Äô impact on the agency's performance is minimal. In both the US and Vietnamese contexts, scholars Vu and Lewis's description of these practices show similarities between the two countries in terms of how relationships and by extension, cronyism, is present and prevalent in various segments of society such as politics and business. One of the largest corruption investigation cases in Vietnam's anti-graft campaign is the Mobifone case in which the police accused the former information minister Nguyen Bac Son of taking $3 million in bribe in connection with Mobifone.  Anti-corruption efforts  In order to improve the business climate and attract foreign investment, Vietnam has taken efforts to combat corruption. The government established a new anti-corruption body and issued the National Strategy for Preventing and Combating Corruption Towards 2020. Vietnam's Anti- Corruption Law 2005 is considered by the World Bank to be among the best anti- corruption legal frameworks in Asia; however, it is considered complicated and challenging for its implementation.

He is the primary author of Hyde's Notebooks, a series of 74 notebooks that are a trove of information for the first years of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William, the highest court in Bengal from 1774 to 1862. The originals of these are kept at the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata. Partial microfilms are held at the National Library of India, Kolkata. The digitised microfilm is available online. The originals, which vary slightly from the microfilm, were digitised in 2015 but are not yet released. Judicial record Hyde gained a reputation as a morally upright judge in a time of general corruption in the British East India Company. While Chief Justice Elijah Impey and puisne judge Sir Robert Chambers both accepted bribes from Governor-General of Bengal Warren Hastings in return for compromising their judicial positions, Hyde refused offers. Hyde was unique among the judges in thinking that all individuals in Bengal, Indians and British alike, deserved the same rights, noting that the Supreme Court's charter called everyone residing in Bengal British subjects: ‚Äúit seems to me that in this clause his majesty expressly calls all the inhabitants of Bengal, Bahar and Orissa, his subjects, which is a fact that the servants of the Company here are not willing to allow.‚Äù Hyde's Notebooks Upon joining the bench, Hyde began an ambitious project to record the trials he and his fellow judges presided over. Hyde desired his notebooks to be printed and published for the public interest but this never happened. Hyde's Notebooks comprise 22,000 pages of handwritten notes in 74 bound volumes written between 1775 and 1798. Of these, 24 were written by Hyde alone, 41 were by Hyde in collaboration with his fellow judges, Sir Robert Chambers, and Sir William Jones, and 9 were by Chambers' alone after Hyde's death. They can be divided as follows: * 14 by Hyde. 1775-1783 * 41 by Hyde, Chambers, and Jones. 1783-1794 * 10 by Hyde. 1794-1796 * 9 by Chambers. 1796-1798 A page from Hyde's Notebooks in March 1781 A page from Hyde's Notebooks in July 1781. Note the shorthand. =Shorthand= Approximately 40 pages of the notebooks are written in shorthand, which Hyde used to conceal thoughts and record his fellow judges accepting bribes. =Notebooks' history= After Hyde's death the notebooks passed to Chief Justice Sir Robert Chambers who continued writing them till his retirement in 1798. Chambers intended to have the notebooks published but died in 1803 before doing so. The notebooks then passed to Chambers' wife Frances Wilton Chambers, who gave them to Sir Charles Harcourt Chambers, the nephew of Robert Chambers and puisne judge at the Bombay Supreme Court. When Charles Harcourt Chambers died in 1828, the notebooks returned to Frances Wilton Chambers who gave them to Sir William Russell, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in 1832. The notebooks remained in the Supreme Court's library until the creation of the High Court of Calcutta in 1862 when they were transferred to the High Court's Bar Library. In 1974, the notebooks were transferred from the High Court's Bar Library to the Victoria Memorial. In 1978, the notebooks, with the exception of volumes 1-3 (since they were too brittle) were microfilmed by the National Library of India. Two microfilm copies were made, one of which remains in poor condition at the National Library while the other is in the United States. In 2019, the U.S. microfilm has been digitised and is available freely online. In 2014 and 2015, the Victoria Memorial in conjunction with Jadavpur University's School of Cultural Texts and Records digitised the notebooks, including the remains of volumes 1-3. However, these digitised images have not yet been released to the public. =Disappeared records= The notebooks (volumes 1-3) from 1775 to 1777, which contained the important Nanda Kumar trial were mostly destroyed due to unknown reasons at some point in the 18th or 19th centuries. The records from the first term of 1780 have disappeared, as well as a small volume with a brass clasp which contained Hyde's detailed notes on some particularly controversial trials. At some point between the creation of the microfilm and Jadavpur University's digitisation project, a portion of the paper at the bottom of one of the volumes was trimmed, resulting in the loss content near the bottom of the page. =Historical importance= The notebooks are a valuable primary source of information for life in late 18th century Bengal. They are the only known remaining source for the early proceedings of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William. As such, the Supreme Court rulings, documented in the notebooks, form the beginning of India‚Äôs current legal system. Attorneys and Judges in the 19th century used his notebooks to write books of precedent and case law. The notebooks were used as the basis for at least three casebooks.William Hook Morley, An analytical digest of all the reported cases decided in the Supreme Courts of Judicature in India, in the Courts of the Hon. East-India Company and on appeal from India, in two volumes (London: William Allen & Co., 1852, 1854), William Hunter Smoult, Collection of Orders, Made and Passed by the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal (Calcutta: S. Smith & Co., 1835) and Thomas Charles Morton, Decisions of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal (Calcutta: S. Smith and Co., 1841).

It features Nayanthara starring her 50th film and Aari in the lead. Lakshmi Priyaa Chandramouli and Amzath Khan were in supporting roles. This was Nayanthara's 50th film, and is regarded as one of the best horror films of Tamil cinema.https://silverscreen.in/news/lady- superstar-15-years-of-nayanthara/ It was one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of 2015. A dubbed Telugu version, Mayuri, was also released. Maya was produced by Potential Studios. The film was remade in Kannada as Aake by K. M. Chaitanya, starring Chiranjeevi Sarja.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movies/news/Aake- is-a-remake/articleshow/56592364.cms Plot Vasanth (Aari) is an artist who is working on a story about 'Mayavanam', a haunted forest. On his friend's birthday, he tells a story involving 'Maya', a malevolent spirit. He tells him about how one experiences chills and witnesses a spirit descending on them when one says \\"Maya! your daughter is not with me\\" three times. In order to ridicule Vasanth, the friend says the same three times, and a similar figure enters the room. He falls back in fear, but the figure reveals itself as his wife; it's just a birthday surprise. The next day, Vasanth shows the pictures taken by him during the dressed up Maya's entry to his boss, Ram Prasad (Amzath Khan) and Madan (Uday Mahesh), the episode writer on Mayavanam. Ram points out a smoky form near them and warns him of it. He tells him about a book, Asylum by Kate, that details the life of the mentally ill who were forced into asylums and experimented upon. Madhan then recounts the story of one such inmate, a woman named Maya Matthews, who was taken to the asylum after murdering her husband and forced to give up her newborn daughter to the authorities in the asylum. She falls to her death from the building, with an expensive ring rumoured to be on her body, and is buried in the grounds of the asylum (Mayavanam), where it is believed her vengeful spirit now roams. Later, Madhan and Vasanth's friend‚Äîan auto driver‚Äîvisits Mayavanam to write about his last episode. Madhan disappears, and after escaping from Mayavanam somehow, Vasanth's friend meets with a grisly death soon, by falling off the building just like Maya, which spurs Vasanth to embark on an investigation into Mayavanam. In alternating scenes, Apsara (Nayantara) is a single mother struggling to make ends meet by working in ad films. She is separated from her husband Arjun who is an actor, and lives with her friend Swathi (Lakshmi Priyaa Chandramouli) who works at a film production house, RK Studios. After a poster of the film, Irul, that Swathi is currently working on is put on to the walls of the house, Apsara experiences strange things happening inside the house. She doesn't give much thought to it because she is always preoccupied by the loan that she has taken from a local gangster. He keeps visiting her house demanding cash and she keeps putting it off by saying that the cheque she has been entitled to, after acting in another ad film previously, keeps bouncing off. In frustration, she goes to visit the ad company where she learns that the producer has gone to take part in the contest arranged by Swathi's company. The contest is a promotional ad for Irul, in which contestants are awarded ‚Çπ5 lakh if they succeed in watching the horror film alone at night without showing signs of fright. She catches an auto and goes to the studio. The scenes are alternated with Vasanth going to Mayavanam and the ad film producer watching the film. By the time she reaches the studio, the producer is dead and is taken on a stretcher towards the ambulance. The director of Irul had witnessed the bizarre death of the ad film producer while watching the film, but claimed to the police it was a heart attack. All lost and her being emotionally tortured by the money lender, Apsara decides to watch Irul, to make ends meet. Swathi begs her not to, fearing for Apsara's life and in hope of the director backing her up, she appeals to him too, but the director supports Apsara even though he knows what could happen later on. The film starts to play, and it is revealed that Vasanth's side of story is the film Irul. As Apsara continues to watch, she is inexplicably teleported into the film. Ram and Kate, the author, is shown to make a man dig into the grounds of Mayavanam, searching for the expensive ring that Maya was said that died with. Vasanth gets caught by Kate and is held at gun point while they search for the ring. Apsara gets caught too, and when they eventually find Maya's coffin, a figure is seen to appear behind Kate and Ram, and all hell breaks loose. Soon Apsara and Vasanth get separated from the group, and are chased by the ghost. They fall into a big ditch and Vasanth helps her out, while he stays in. She runs away and hears a baby's cry. She goes in search of it, when she gets shot by Shankar. After falling down, she is held by Maya who cries out in bitter rage and kills Shankar. It is then revealed that Maya is Apsara's mother. She wakes up in the theatre, with her mother's diary on her lap, and the doll, which Maya had brought for her baby. It is later revealed that the person who played Vasanth in the film is Arjun himself and producer of the ad film who died earlier, was the one who sent Maya to the asylum and took her ring. The final scene shows Apsara reunited with her husband and now acting in a film about Maya directed by the same director as Irul. As the shooting starts, the first scene being Maya sitting in a wheelchair, Arjun finds Apsara standing in a corner while everyone was assuming that she was the one sitting in the wheelchair. The film ends with the spirit Maya killing the director and Maya's ring falling out of his pocket. After that Maya turns back and the screen cuts black.

On Transparency International's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index, Sudan ranked 177th out of 183 countries. On the 2010 World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators, on one hundred point scale, it scored in the single digits in every category, including 0.9 for political stability, 6.2 for rule of law, 7.2 for regulatory quality, 6.7 for government effectiveness, and 4.3 for control of corruption. It ranked 174th (out of 177) in the 2013 Corruption Perception Index. In 2011 Freedom House named Sudan as one of the worst nations for human rights. Sudan presents one of the most challenging business environments in the world. Sectors where foreign investments are concentrated, such as construction and transportation, are recognized worldwide as being very prone to corruption. Corruption exists in every sector of the economy and in every level of the Sudanese government. It takes the form of \\"financial and political corruption, nepotism, and misuse of power\\". According to the Sudan Democracy First Group, petty corruption is pervasive for citizens seeking government services. One source notes the ubiquity in Sudan of \\"petty and grand corruption, embezzlement of public funds, and a system of political patronage well entrenched within the fabrics of society\\", and that the effects of corruption are often obfuscated by constant instability. While patronage negatively affects businesses, police and military corruption infringe on civil rights. In recent years, Sudan has enjoyed rapid economic growth, mainly owing to its natural resources, including several high-demand natural resources, increasing the opportunities for corruption. Background Colonel Omar al-Bashir took power during an islamic a 1989 coup after which he executed 30 military officers who initiated a failed coup attempt in 1990. He acceded to the presidency in 1993. He then took further measures to silence his opposition including numerous executions. The Second Sudanese Civil War ended in 2005, and after a long ceasefire, in 2011 South Sudan gained independence. Nonetheless, corruption remained rampant, all while a new conflict arose in Darfur, between government- supported Janjaweed forces and rebel groups seeking control of state natural resources. By 2009 the conflict was deemed a genocide and the International Criminal Court called for al-Bashir's arrest. Corruption in the public sector Corruption is common among Sudanese government officials, who routinely act with total impunity, knowing that they will almost certainly not be investigated for any transgression. Sources have stated that the opportunities for corruption are created by an inefficient administration and bureaucracy, along with poor record-keeping and a lack of transparency. Bribes are commonly demanded by government employees. =Bribery= Bribery is a commonplace demand made by public officials for services that citizenry are entitled to by law. Of respondents to a 2011 Transparency International survey who had had dealt with various Sudanese government entities, almost a quarter were forced to pay bribes. Bribery demands were particularly high among the police, the customs bureau, tax authorities, and land services. =Police= Sudanese police officers are alleged to commit several human-rights abuses, including making arbitrary and unwarranted arrests. Law enforcement officials are said to receive bribes on a regular basis from citizenry. In addition, investigations lack any due process and retaliations against police critics are common. The Sudanese police force is said to surpass all other government agencies in the public's perception of corrupt agencies. In addition, law- enforcement officers are subject to interference by government officials, and hiring for the police force can often be explained by political connections rather than by professional qualifications. =Judiciary= The Sudanese judiciary is not an independent branch of government and is therefore subject to influence by other branches of government. Efficiency in the courts is also hampered by inadequate resources, poor infrastructure, poor training, inadequate salaries, and long delays before trial. Freedom House reported that courts are often subject to political manipulation and fail to meet international legal standards. =Customs officials= Customs regulations are not uniformly enforced. Companies and officials with political connections are often exempted from customs duties, who earn income through importing goods without paying tariffs. =Job appointments= In August 2015, the head of the Darfur Regional Authority (DRA) and former head of the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM), were publicly accused of corruption. Abu Garda said Sese had complete authority over appointing government positions at every level. In other words, Sese had stripped all authority from the DRA, as a result of which the Council of Ministers had a total of four meetings in four years. Abu Garda said that the people of Darfur should impeach Sese as president of the DRA for failure to implement a recovery and enabling corruption in the Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program. =Procurement= Sudanese legislation is supposed to address conflicts of interest on the part of public procurement officials and is also supposed to provide for the monitoring of these officials' finances, but in practice these laws are not enforced. Companies with Islamist connections are unfairly awarded public contracts without following the proper procedures for bidding. They subsequently subcontract to party loyalists, eliminating any competition, leading to a high frequency of small businesses failing. =Ministry of Finance and budgeting= In January 2014, the Sudanese Ministry of Finance was accused by El Tahir Abdel Gayoum, an auditing body, of omitting SDG16 billion pounds in liabilities from its ledger. The auditors noted other irregularities, including the retention by ministries of $12.1 million in funds intended for the finance ministry, the spending of extra-budgetary funds by some government units, the retention of consultants whose contracts had not been renewed, the retention on the payroll of former government employees, and the awarding of bids by influential government figures to associates at above- market prices and without written contracts. In March 2014, economic minister Adel Abdel Aziz, held the Ministry of Finance responsible for Sudan's poor showing on international corruption indexes. He accused the Ministry of Finance of mismanaging the budget and of administrative negligence and said that the Ministry uses political power to force tenders, bribery, royalties, and allocation of lands to their benefit. The Sudanese budget is alleged to be completely opaque and therefore easily allow embezzlement. Sudan was ranked lowest score in all East Africa on the 2010 Open Budget Index. According to the United States sources, over US$2 billion of public funding was embezzled in 2008. The entire military budget is undisclosed, allowing for no insight into spending. Tax collection in Sudan is characterized as lacking rule of law where the politically connected are given breaks, but all others suffer unjustly high taxes. There is no uniform tax code across the country, leading many to misreport incomes and apply creative methods to cheat taxes. In addition, the one agency involved in fixing the tax code lacks necessary resources and independence to sufficiently improve the tax environment. =Treatment of media= Media outlets in Sudan are subjected to political manipulations and lack journalistic independence. As a result, government agencies regularly censor newspapers and mandate outlets to release pro- government stories. Under the 2009 Press and Publication Act, journalists and others who are critical of the government can face harassment and arrest, as well as violence in some cases. Several private newspapers have faced arrests, seizures, and raids. Visas are denied to some foreign reporters as well. According to the Radio Dabanga website, the Sudanese Security Service monitors all Sudanese newspapers daily, demanding editors delete and censor news about corruption, security, or the war crimes committed by the government against its own citizens in Darfur, South Kordofan, and along the Blue Nile. Also, several journalists have noted that the ruling National Congress Party does not allow any media to be published not in their interests. On 22 January 2014, members of Sudanese police in Khartoum confiscated all of that day's El Jareeda newspapers at the printer. The government did not explain the action, although the headline story in that day's newspaper was about corruption at the Sudanese Cottons Company. El Jareedas story reported that the Auditor General's office had accused Badr El Din Mahmoud, Minister of Finance and former deputy director of the Bank of Sudan, of several crimes including forgery and misuse of legal tender, while he was chairman of the Committee on Purchases of the New Ginneries. In July 2015, the Sudanese government ordered the director of the National Television and Radio Corporation to stop airing ‚ÄúBeit El Jalous,‚Äù a new radio show hosted by screenwriter and psychologist Ali Baldo, who on the program addressed rising corruption and nepotism in Sudan. Baldo accused prominent leaders and major figures in the media of pressuring officials to stop the series. =Treatment of NGOs= Conditions for NGOs in Sudan, according to Freedom House, have worsened significantly due to antagonism towards government critics. In 2009, when an arrest warrant was issued for Omar al-Bashir, Sudan responded by expelling several international humanitarian aid organizations, revoking permits for thirteen foreign NGOs and permanently shutting down three domestic NGOs. =Elections= Elections in Sudan are riddled with corruption. Bashir was re-elected by a large majority in the 2010 elections, the country's first open election in over two decades, but international observers expressed deep concern about extensive fraud and intimidation. According to the observers, the election was not fair by international standards; the US State Department deemed them unfree and unfair. Fairness in the 2010 election was rendered impossible by the strict limits on freedom of the press, of assembly, and of expression, by a lack of media coverage, and by the buying of votes. While some opposition parties boycotted the 2010 elections, other opposition parties that took part in them refused to recognize the results, charging voting fraud. Prior to the elections, several candidates have been known to withdraw their candidacies in exchange for explicit and implicit bribes. This practice has made it common for some to run without the intent of taking office, but rather be offered a bargain to withdraw from the election. Writing in the ‚Äò‚ÄôNew York Daily News‚Äô‚Äô about the April 2010 elections, Dan Morrison stated that in addition to such ‚Äústructural issues‚Äù as ‚Äúthe manipulated census, the gerrymandering, the packing of the National Election Commission with ruling party retainers, or the use of patronage to secure blocks of votes and suppress competition,‚Äù there were reports of school children who were allowed to cast votes; soldiers who voted ‚Äúboth at their duty station and also, magically, at their home villages hundreds of miles away‚Äù; election officials who used ‚Äúsolvents to dilute the indelible ink that is meant to stain the fingers and prevent repeat voting‚Äù; and ‚Äústuffed or stolen‚Äù ballot boxes. =Sale of public lands= In 2014 public lands were sold in great quantity in southern Darfur. In November of that year an investigation was launched to determine if these lands were sold to ineligible owners with government connections, without the proper consent. In turn, the investigative committee was accused of neglecting legal recourse against those responsible for the illegal sales. =DDR misappropriations= In late 2014, the nation's Minister of Health, accused Dr. Tijani Sese, leader of the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM), of using his own personal guard rather than LJM operatives to aid in the DDR program, allowing for over $2 billion of public funding to be misappropriated by private soldiers and embezzled into undisclosed accounts. Corruption in business Sudan's business sector is rife with corruption, due to no mechanisms existing to promote transparency. Several international business organizations have warned investors that Sudan's business environment is considered high-risk. Doing business in Sudan requires unordinary excessive amounts of documentation, fees, and procedures which all increase the likelihood of public officials soliciting bribes to ease the process or ignore certain rules. Sudan was ranked 135th (of 183 countries) on the 2012 Ease of doing business index. The Financial Standards Foundation characterized Sudan in 2010 as a difficult nation to conduct business. =The oil sector= After South Sudan seceded, taking with it most of Sudan's oil wealth, the Sudanese government imposed greater rule and regulation of the remaining industry. Omar al-Bashir is alleged to funnel the nation's oil revenues into his own private accounts. A WikiLeaks report alleged that al-Bashir embezzled nearly US$9 billion in Sudanese oil revenues. =Sports= According to a September 2015 report, a lack of oversight governing the sale of tickets to soccer matches has led to the emergence of a criminal network that profits illegally by manipulating the sale of ticket sales. The people involved in this corruption are the stadium ticket-sellers, stadium employees, and the relevant regulatory authorities. The stadium employees only tear a handful of the tickets they are handed by fans. They then resell the bulk of them to the ticket seller, who in turn sell them back to the public, greatly overfilling the stadiums. The scheme is said to be run by a mafia. Also, some fans can get into games by bribing stadium employees with an amount less than the ticket price, while the stadium can report the full seat price as an expense. This scheme results in substantial financial losses for football clubs and the cities in which they are based and causes widespread consternation. But the Sudanese Football Association, which employs these people, has failed to address it seriously. =Transport= Corruption is endemic in the sale of bus tickets. After approximately half the tickets for any given bus trip have been sold at the ticket office for the official price, the sale is cut off and the bus conductors then start selling the remaining tickets on the black market for almost double the official price. When would-be ticket buyers complain, they are informed that the tickets have been reserved for soldiers, or that the tickets have been reserved in advance by other passengers. Moreover, after all the tickets have been sold, either legally or illegally, the conductor and driver load yet more passengers onto the bus, usually under supervision of traffic enforcement who purposefully do not report newly added passengers. These police are therefore participants in this corrupt system. In addition, they record a false departure time for the bus, so that the driver can drive faster and make extra trips. Also involved in this scheme are police officers at highway checkpoints, who play along with these deceptions. This kind of corruption not only cheats customers but endangers them and others, and in case of a bus accident would invalidate any insurance claims. Nepotism Nepotism and favoritism is a rampent problem. It is common practice for businessmen to pay kickbacks to family members in government positions in exchange for contracts. Top leaders of the ruling party control at least 164 companies. Among the richest men in Sudan, for example, is one of President Bashir's brothers, who controls the cement industry and is the chief supplier of the Merowe Dam construction firm. Two other brothers of Bashir are reportedly majority shareholders of a firm that owns shares of over twenty of the largest subsidiaries. Corruption in mine disposal program Dismissed employees of the Sudanese Association for Combating Mines (Jasmar), accused its director in November 2014 of stealing large numbers of technical devices borrowed from the UN, of creating shell companies in Ed Daein, East Darfur, and Zalingei, Central Darfur, of forging invoices, and of making off with ‚Äúvehicles, office furniture, and other equipment‚Äù worth about half a million Sudanese pounds. The director had also allegedly dealt out over 20 Toyota Land Cruisers to individuals who were in no way associated with the mine disposal program, charged one dismissed official, who also said that three major power generators had also gone missing. Anti-corruption efforts Until recently, Sudan had no federal anti-corruption agency. Corruption charges were almost never investigated, although the Auditor General urged the prosecution of certain officials for embezzling public funds. At an emergency cabinet meeting in March 2014, President Bashir ordered his Council of Ministers to combat corruption and introduced an anti-corruption reform plan which would be implemented by a new committee and five new sub-committees. Despite the government's claims to want to fight corruption, its anti-corruption agency has so far failed to bring corrupt public officials to justice. The relevant public disclosing body is supposed to serve as an ombudsman, but is underfunded and lacks independence. The office of the Auditor General is nominally independent under Sudanese law, but in practice is subject to political influence. The office also has insufficient resources and the government rarely takes any serious steps to combat corruption. The office has itself, moreover, been the target of corruption allegations. In a 2007 case, three high-ranking officials in the office were suspended in an embezzlement case. According to one source, Sudan has poor anti-corruption measures in place due to weak administrative protocols, \\"wavering\\" political will to combat corruption, and a blurred distinction between the government and the ruling political party. Sudan has endorsed anti-corruption protocols from the United Nations. Still, however, public officials are not required to disclose their finances and there is no provision for transparency. Sudanese criminal law is supposed to protect officials who report corruption. In practice, however, whistleblowers often experience retaliation.

He resides in Svarga, the Hindu heaven, governed by Indra. He has a sister called Jayanti. He appears in various Hindu scriptures as fighting wars on behalf of the gods and his father. Jayanta also appears in the epic Ramayana and other lore, in which he disguises himself as a crow. As a crow Rama shoots the Brahmastra on Jayanta, disguised as a crow and who is flying here and there to escape the weapon. In the Sundara Kanda (fifth Book of the epic Ramayana), when Hanuman meets Sita, she narrates an incident that happened in the forest in Chitrakuta. The prince of Ayodhya and avatar of the god Vishnu, Rama is exiled to the forest with his wife Sita (an avatar of Vishnu's wife Lakshmi) and brother Lakshmana. A fatigued Rama was sleeping in the lap of Sita, when a crow attacked her. The crow pecks at her twice; once on her breast or between her breasts in some versions. The Ramcharitmanas replaces the breast with feet. In hurry to drive away the crow, she tries to fasten her garments, but ends up loosening them. Rama is awakened and recognizes the crow whose claws were dripping in blood as the son of Indra. An enraged Rama, at the behest of Sita, picks a blade of grass and unleashes the divine weapon Brahmastra out of it on the crow, who flees in fear. The crow flies across the universe, but the weapon follows. Turned back by Indra, Brahma, Shiva and rishis (sages), the crow takes refuge in Rama and surrenders to him. The son of Indra requests pardon, but Rama says that the Brahmastra cannot be withdrawn. So, the son of Indra asks it to hit the crow's right eye, and he is left half-blind.Goldman pp. 216-218 While Jayanta is not explicitly named in the episode, various commentaries on the epic like the Tilaka and the Bhushana by Govindaraja identify Jayanta as the \\"son of Indra\\"; some other commentaries do not identify any individual son of Indra. Govindaraja says only Jayanta is known as the son of Indra.Goldman p. 456 Besides the Ramayana, Jayanta is said to have assumed the form of the crow in some tellings of the Samudra manthan episode. A pot of amrita (elixir of life) emerged from the churning of the ocean by the gods and the demons. The demons seized the pot, but Jayanta took it from them in the guise of a crow. Pursued by the demons, he flew for twelve days without rest. He stopped at four locations on earth: Prayag, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nashik, where the Kumbha Mela is celebrated every twelve years in remembrance of the incident. Fighting on behalf of the gods The last Book Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana describes a battle between Indra and the rakshasa (demon) king Ravana. While Indra battles Ravana, Jayanta fights with Ravana's son Meghanada. A fierce battle ensues between Jayanta and Meghanada; ultimately Ravana's son strikes Jayanta, who falls unconscious. In the confusion, Puloman, his maternal grandfather, takes Jayanta away from the battlefield, unseen by anyone and hides him in the ocean. Indra presumes Jayanta dead and fights more powerfully, but Meghanada defeats him too. Jayanta is also described to fight in the battle between the gods and asuras (demons) in the Padma Purana. The Harivamsa mentions the battle between Indra and the god Krishna to acquire the celestial tree Parijat from Indra's heaven. Jayanta is described battling Krishna's son Pradyumna and is defeated. In the Skanda Purana, Jayanta is defeated by the asura Surapadman, who is finally killed by the commander-in-chief of the gods, Skanda. Other legends The Vayu Purana narrates a tale wherein Jayanta is cursed and turned into a bamboo. This tale is also told in context of devadasi lore with some variation. Once the sage Agastya arrived in Indra's court and was welcomed by Indra, by organizing a dance performance of the apsara Urvashi. In the performance, Urvashi and Jayanta looked in each other's eyes in love. The distracted Urvashi missed the beat and the dance went haywire. An agitated Agastya cursed Urvashi to be born on earth as a devadasi and Jayanta to be a bamboo tree in the Vindhya mountains. The duo bowed in reverence and prayed for mercy. The sage said that the curse will end when Urvashi will be presented with a talaikole (a bamboo staff, Jayanta) on her dance debut (Arangetram). As ordained, the lovers were released from the curse and returned to heaven, when Urvashi got united with Jayanta as the bamboo staff.

From 2008 to 2014 Ling served as the Vice-Chairman of Shanxi People's Political Consultative Conference, and prior to that the Director of Shanxi Development and Reform Commission. He was placed under investigation for corruption in June 2014. Biography Born Linghu Zhengce to a Communist official's family in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, Ling and all his three siblings received names related to the Communist Party terminology. His own name, Zhengce, means \\"policy\\". He got involved in politics in October 1968 and joined the Chinese Communist Party in November 1973. Ling initially worked at a hospital, and then was transferred to work as a labourer a sulphur mine. Between 1971 and 1982 Ling worked for the party organization in Yuncheng, and subsequently for the party's General Office of Shanxi province. In 1984, Ling graduated from Shanxi University, majoring in Chinese literature. After graduation Ling returned to work in the General Office for the \\"books and literature division\\" (). He spent much of the next decade working for confidential document classification in the provincial government, before being promoted in 1997 to become the deputy director of provincial grain distribution. Beginning in 2000, Ling worked as a functionary for provincial planning and development. In 2004, he was appointed the Director of Shanxi Development and Reform Commission, a powerful government agency that had vast powers over the provincial economy. In January 2008, he was appointed the Vice-Chairman of Shanxi People's Political Consultative Conference. On June 19, 2014, it was announced that he would be investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CCDI) for \\"serious violations of laws and regulations\\". Ling Zhengce's brother Ling Jihua was expelled from the party in mid 2015 and indicted on a series of criminal charges. On August 21, 2015, following the CCDI investigation, Ling Zhengce was also expelled from the Chinese Communist Party. In its official announcement, the CCDI accused Ling of taking bribes to obtain promotions and business interests for others, and for using his office to seek gain for his relatives. He was also accused of obstructing the investigation. Like his brother, Ling Zhengce was also accused of \\"violating political rules.\\" He was rumoured to be a member of the mysterious Xishan Society. On December 16, 2016, Ling was sentenced for 12-and-a-half years in prison in Changzhou Intermediate Court, for taking either directly or indirectly 16 million yuan ($2.67 million) in bribes from 2001 to 2014. Personal life Ling hails from the prominent Linghu political family of Pinglu County, Shanxi. He has three brothers and one sister. His brother, Ling Jihua, was one of the top aides to former Communist Party general secretary Hu Jintao.

He heads Dada Bhagwan Foundation. He teaches the Akram Vignan philosophy developed by Dada Bhagwan. Early life Deepakbhai Desai was born on 9 May 1953 in Morbi, Saurashtra State (now in Gujarat), India. His family belonged to Vavania and his paternal ancestral home was next door to that of Shrimad Rajchandra. He is the youngest among five children. He graduated with a degree in the Mechanical Engineering from VJTI in Mumbai in the early 1970s. After graduating from college, he worked in the textile industry as a mechanical engineer for a few years. Later he founded a consulting firm working in the textile industry. One day his elder brother told him about a Gnani Purush Ambalal Muljibhai Patel (fondly known as Param Pujya 'Dadashri' or Param Pujya 'Dada Bhagwan'), whose knowledge of Akram Vignan would help him concentrate in his studies. At that time, Pujya Deepakbhai was studying engineering at VJTI College in Bombay. This soft- spoken, humble and introverted young man found worldly life meaningless and cumbersome. Little did he know that meeting this Gnani would be a major turning point in his life, transforming His life beyond imagination. Spiritual career Trimandir at Adalaj On March 6, 1971, Pujya Deepakbhai attained Self Realization from Param Pujya Dadashri, the enlightened One. He was seventeen years old at the time. This spiritual experience of Self Realization ignited within him a thirst for in-depth learning and understanding of the phenomenal knowledge of Akram Vignan. During the 1980s, Niruben Amin was one of the chief disciples of Dada Bhagwan who recorded tapes of discourses of Dada Bhagwan. He helped Amin transcribe and compile tapes which were later published as volumes of Aptavani. In 1987, Dada Bhagwan ordained him as Aptaputra who are allowed to conduct spiritual discourses. He traveled in India and abroad to conduct discourses. After death of Dada Bhagwan in 1988, Niruben Amin founded Dada Bhagwan Foundation. In 2003, she ordained Deepakbhai Desai to conduct Gnanvidhi ceremonies and 'transmit' self- realization (Atma Gnan). After death of Niruben Amin in 2006, she was succeeded by Deepakbhai Desai to head the organisations. Deepakbhai holds religious discourses in person around the world and on television.

Introduced some 25 years after the R90S, the company's first sports bike, the R1100S was the first BMW bike having clip-on handlebars, rearset footrests and a removable cowl to cover the pillion seat. Producing nearly 100 hp, it has been described as a \\"sporty sports-tourer\\". Design The engine is a flat-twin \\"oilhead\\" that has air-cooled cylinders but oil-cooled heads. Derived from the BMW R1100RS, the 1,085 cc fuel-injected eight-valve engine is tuned for a maximum output of at 8,400rpm. At the time of its introduction, it was BMW's most powerful boxer engine ever made, and the first mated to a six-speed transmission. The ohv engine has chain-driven camshafts mounted in the cylinder heads, operating the valves via short pushrods and rocker arms. Engines produced after 2003 had dual ignition, with two spark plugs per cylinder.Haynes Manual - \\"BMW 850,1100 & 1150 4-valve twins\\" page 0.8 The compact close-ratio six-speed transmission is derived from the BMW K1200RS. Far from being a touring overdrive, the top gear gives 20 mph per 1,000rpm, so at 80 mph the engine turns at 4,000rpm. In addition to using the engine as a stressed member, the R1100S has a composite aluminum frame to which the suspension components are attached. The front suspension is BMW's patented Telelever, with long telescopic fork sliders containing neither springs nor damping. In order to minimize \\"fork dive\\", braking forces are taken back to the frame via a pivoting wishbone. A monoshock on this wishbone copes with springing and damping. The rear suspension comprises BMW's \\"Paralever\\", a single-sided swinging arm encompassing shaft drive. The Paralever mounts directly to the frame instead of to the gearbox as on earlier oilheads. A reviewer reported: ‚ÄúThe result is greater frame rigidity and better handling\\". A detachable tubular subframe supports the rider and passenger. The R1100S has a very substantial half fairing which completely envelops the alloy fuel tank. Both the hugger (after market option) and front fender are made of carbon-fibre. The two-into-one exhaust feeds twin silencers tucked up high beneath the pillion seat, like those on the Ducati 916. Factory options originally available from BMW included electrically-heated grips, ABS brakes and a belly-pan fairing. Reception The R1100S is lighter and more powerful than the BMW R1100RS from which it was derived, but at (wet), it can in no way be considered a lightweight. Nevertheless, What Bike? magazine stated: \\"With underseat exhaust and plenty of ground clearance, the BMW is helped by the lack of dive under braking and makes up metres on the entry to corners. Mid-corner speed is superb, but it's on the exit that the air-cooled twin shows its short legs. Stick to the road, though, and the R1100S is a great place to be\\". Motor Cycle News (MCN) later reviewed the R1100S, stating: \\"The BMW R1100S is now starting to be regarded as something of a classic, especially in BoxerCup form. Classy styling, VFR-esque comfort and versatility plus BMW quality and residuals make for a stonking and attractive all-rounder, if not quite the sports bike BM intended‚Ä¶\\". Special editions of the BMW R1100S BoxerCup Replika A special edition model was the R1100S Sport, which was a standard R1100S fitted with an optional \\"Sport\\" pack comprising stiffer suspension via a taller rear monoshock, a steering damper, and a wider rear wheel and tyre.Haynes Manual - \\"BMW 850,1100 & 1150 4-valve twins\\" page 0.9 Bike magazine commented: \\"The basic R1100S is good value, but we're not convinced that the high spec Sport version offers any real benefit for road riders\\".Bike magazine July 2002 page 51 A more expensive track-day version of the BMW R1100S, the BoxerCup Replika (or \\"BCR\\"), was available from 2003-2005. The BCR had twin Laser under-seat exhausts, braided brake lines, carbon-fibre cylinder head protectors, a carbon-fibre oil-catcher bellypan, uprated √ñhlins suspension, and a shorter paralever torque arm which raised the rear end to quicken the steering and increase cornering clearance.Bike magazine July 2002 page 27 Later BoxerCup and Sport models had matte black engines, with the cylinders and cylinder heads remaining silver. The raised suspension of the BCR increased cylinder head cornering clearance (compared to the standard R1100RS), but this somewhat compromised the motorcycle for normal town/road use. The BCR came with a standard engine management chip which was changed for a modified chip at the first dealer service. Despite the different chip, the Replika claimed no more power than the standard R1100S nor the Sport. The R1200S The R1100S was superseded in 2006 by the R1200S. The alloy frame of the R1100S was replaced by a lightweight tubular trellis and so, with a tuned engine, the R1200S was lighter and 25% more powerful. MCN compared the R1200S to its predecessor this way: \\"As an oddball track motorcycle it works, but as an accomplished all-rounder it falls short of the standards set by the R1100S that preceded it.\\"BMW R1200S (2006-2007) Review, motorcyclenews.com, dated 23 November 2006, retrieved 1 December 2014 In 2008 the R1200S was itself superseded by the double overhead camshaft HP2 Sport.http://www.topspeed.com/motorcycles/motorcycle-reviews/bmw/2012-bmw- hp2-sport-ar126981.html References External links * R1100RS Category:Motorcycles powered by flat engines Category:Shaft drive motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1998 ","title":"BMW R1100S"},{"id":"43141880","text":"Nalanda is considered one of the first great universities in recorded history.

History =Soviet Era= Rock was greatly restricted for most of the period Azerbaijan was under Soviet rule, being viewed by the CPSU as a Western anti-socialist influence. Among the most recognized groups of the Soviet era were Cold√ºnya, Yuxu, Eksulap and Khurramids.  60s-70s  1960s was the period when Azerbaijani rock was formed. Leading bands of this period were namely Eskulap (1966), Khurramids (1969), Express-118, Pazavang and Uvet which were mainly playing soft rock and blues. Khurramids performed live in festival dedicated to 51st establishment of Azerbaijan State University with a cover version of \\"I can't get no\\" by Rolling Stones in 1970. Following first decade of Azerbaijani rock, 70s gave rise to jazz rock with ethnic elements. C√ºrb…ôc√ºr was founded by Jahangir Garayev, elder brother of Abulfas Garayev in 1970. Other notable bands were M…ô≈ü…ôl (Torch), Brevis (1971) and √ú√ß Alov (Three Flames). However, main driving force were considered Experiment-OK (1967) and Ashiqlar (1973). Jazz fusion era ended with \\"ASU Physics faculty band\\" (1972) according to Hikmat Hajizadeh (former ambassador of Azerbaijan to Russia) who played solo guitars back then. Meanwhile, in Sumgayit, Miraj and Rovesnik bands were active.  1980s  The later 1970s were largely silent and few bands survived political restrictions. The early 1980s saw soft rock band G√ºnel and Polad Bulbuloglu's emergence as Ashiqlar vocalist. The latter gained union-wide popularity and toured RSFSR and Mongolia, gave concerts in Afghanistan. Other successful band was Talisman which was a part of supergroup Gaya. Band played live in Moscow, during 12th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1985. Later 80s saw emergence of many bands due to establishment of Baku Youth Modern Music Center. Weqibond was one of these bands founded by Ibrahim Emin who would later found Yuxu. Years after first festival was held in Baku in 1 May 1988 - \\"Rock Panorama\\". \\"Rock Panorama 2\\" festival was held in 1989, which was larger than its predecessor. About 30 bands took part including Qrimsiz (Makeupless), Faust, Neysan, ƒ∞z (Trail), Terminal, Reportaj, Charley ATL, Minaret, etc. Soft rock band G√ºnel was renamed into Aksiya (Action). =Post-Soviet Era=  90s  Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rock audience in Azerbaijan started slowly to grow and groups like Unformal gained popularity among local fans. Sumgayit was credited as the main regional driving force behind these rock bands of the 1990s, including Yuxu, Spark, Miraj, Mozalan, and Sirr. Other active bands were Industry, NemO, P.G.L.U. Project, Fatal Nation, Taj.  2000s  leftBeing more connected to Western music and availability of instruments compared to Soviet Union, 2000s saw many bands being formed including 3.14. New bands like Ferrum, The Nails, Pro'n'Con, Mechanic Fist and numerous others were fast to rise, however most of them quickly dissolved after formation. Hard rock band B…ônd…ô hailing from Sumgayit was founded in 2008.  2010s  Azerbaijani rock scene gained momentum after 2010. New genres including heavy metal, metalcore and black metal received positive responses. Silence Lies Fear, Meridian, Sirat, Tengri, Vozmezdie, The Midnight, Orient Express were exclusively successful. Pagan black metal band √ú√∂r was founded in 2011. Sadnos which was founded by Sasha Goncharov is still one of active projects. Stoner bands including Lavatory Service and Pyraweed are also considered main influence in rock scene. In 2014, Tuborg GreenFest was held in Baku. It was the largest rock festival in the country's history.

Peregrine Bertie, brother of the fourth Earl of Abingdon, died shortly after being elected MP for Oxford earlier that year. The freemen of the borough sponsored Annesley, who was connected with Lord Abingdon.Thorne (1986) The election was a relatively easy victory for Annesley, who did not spend on it, and whose only opposition, in the form of George Ogilvie, came from a minority of freemen and has been described as \\"feeble and opportunist\\".Aspinal and Thorne (1986) Annesley won by 618 votes, to Ogilvie's 103.Thorne (1986) He supported the Government of William Pitt the younger, but left relatively mark on Parliament's history, being recorded voting on only a handful of occasions, including on the Test Act in Scotland. He was defeated at the 1796 election by a London merchant, Henry Peters, who is estimated to have spent ¬£10,000 on the election.Thorne (1986) It is possible that it was Annesley who supported John Ingram Lockhart to stand (unsuccessfully) in 1802 in an effort to oust Peters.Aspinall and Thorne (1986) He never returned to Parliament, although he remained active in local politics, in 1806, for instance, he opposed the Duke of Marlborough's candidate for Oxford.

Biography Alexander Bogen was born in Tartu, EstoniaInterview with Alexander Bogen, Survivor and Artist, Yad Vashem and brought up in Wilno. As a young boy he adhered to the values of the Yiddish culture of Yung Vilne, as well as to the modern Polish culture. After completing his studies at the gymnasium, he was accepted to the Stefan Batory art academy affiliated with the Wilno University, where he studied painting and sculpture. His parents were physicians. His father came from a secular family and his mother was the daughter of Rabbi Tuvia Lobitzki, the rabbi of Wo≈Çkowysk, Poland. His studies were interrupted by World War II. Bogen joined the partisans and became a commander of the Jewish partisan unit in the Narocz Forests. He buried many of the drawings he made at this time near Lake Narocz. He returned to the ghetto in September 1943 and helped to facilitate the rescue of members of the United Partisan Organization (FPO), a Jewish underground movement active in the ghetto and lead by poet Abba Kovner, Bogen's school friend. When the Vilna Ghetto was about to be destroyed, Bogen and his partisans tried to rescue some key people, one of whom was Abraham Sutzkever. With the help of the soviet partisans, they managed to finally smuggle him into Moscow along with some of Bogen's drawings, which were eventually exhibited in Moscow After the war Bogen returned to his studies, finished his academic degree and was mastered as an artist of monumental painting at the USB Academy of Art in Vilna.

Resistance through art Bogen continued to draw during the war, documenting what he saw: > \\"We saw abandoned children. We saw people being led to the slaughter. I did > not lay down my pencil for a moment. An artist condemned to death portraying > people condemned to extermination... I sketched the forest, my brothers-in- > arms, the battle itself.

Personal Todd was born on March 5, 1870, in San Bernardino, California, the son of Asa Todd of Los Angeles and Mary Caroline Phyne of Virginia. He was taken to Los Angeles as a child, and he attended Los Angeles High School on Fort Moore Hill and Woodbury's Business College in Los Angeles. He was married in 1896 at age 28 in Immanuel Presbyterian Church to Minnie F. Reinert of Los Angeles, age 22. They had one child, Frances (Mrs. Howard Torkelson). Todd was a life member of Al Malaikah Shrine, a director of the Los Angeles County Pioneer Society and president of Ramona Parlor, Native Sons of the Golden West, of which he was president in 1898. Todd died on March 4, 1943, at Queen of Angels Hospital after an operation, leaving his widow, Helen G. Todd of 1710 West Sixth Street, and a daughter, Frances Torkelson of San Antonio, Texas, and two grandchildren. Interment was in Inglewood Park Mausoleum. Vocation =Journalism= In 1889, Todd was the Los Angeles City Hall reporter for the Los Angeles Star, then moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he for two years he was city editor for the Tucson Star. Afterward, he was a reporter with the San Diego Union, and in 1893 he returned to Los Angeles, where he became city editor for the Los Angeles Express. Los Angeles Mayor Meredith P. Snyder made Todd his secretary and clerk in 1896. =Politics= In Arizona, Todd was the secretary of the Arizona Territorial Democratic Convention and a member of the executive committee of the Democratic Central Committee of Pima County. Todd was elected to the Los Angeles City Council in 1898, representing the 8th Ward; he served until 1904. On the council, he sponsored a measure that would have established a hospital in the city to treat smallpox cases. \\"It is an injustice to quarantine a whole boarding or lodging house because a case of smallpox has been discovered.. . . . The city has spent enough money in guard hire in the last year to more than pay for the erection of a detention hospital.\\" =Legal practice= While in the City Council, Todd studied privately under the direction of W. B. Matthews, who was then the city attorney. On October 25, 1903, he was admitted to the California State Bar, having passed a \\"stiff\\" examination before the California Supreme Court. He was examined by Justice Walter Van Dyke and was vouched for by attorneys Herbert Goudge, Mathews, W.E. Dunn and Frank Flint. One of the notable cases he argued as a private attorney was in opposition to the initiative section of a new Los Angeles city charter, which, he said, was unconstitutional \\"in that it attempts to provide for legislation by a direct vote of the people instead of by representatives of the people elected for that purpose and is therefore inconsistent with a republican form of government.\\" He also represented twelve of the 26 \\"Japanese\\" who appeared before the city's police commission to seek restaurant liquor licenses. He suggested that the secretary of the Japanese Association, \\"which represents the better element of Japanese,\\" be consulted. In 1933 or 1936 he became a deputy city attorney. He retired in March 1940.
