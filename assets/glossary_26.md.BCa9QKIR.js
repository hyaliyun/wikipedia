He was the son of Guigues d'Albon and Gotelana de Cl√©rieux. Biography The official history written by George de Manteyer has caused him to be known as the first Dauphin of Viennois, despite this designation only appearing a century later. Guigues was an ambitious minor noble who extended his domain between the Rhone and the Alps. In 1016, he is called \\"count\\" in a charter concerning his possessions in Moirans. Thereafter, he was a landowner in Champsaur (1027), in Oisans with the title of count (1035), Gr√©sivaudan (around 1050), Brian√ßonnais (around 1053), and in the valley of Oulx (1070). From 1035, he was always dignified with the title of \\"count\\". It is not known how Guigues took possession of the lands, but his power enabled him to install family members as bishop. Guy's uncle de Guigues was bishop of Grenoble, and succeeded Isarn. The episcopate then passed to a cousin, Mallen. His brother was bishop of Valence and the archbishop's palace at Vienne, attached to the most prestigious church of the province, was in the hands of a cousin by marriage. He married Adelaide, who seems to be of the family of the counts de Turin, and had a son, Guigues II (1025‚Äì1079), who succeeded him. His elder son, Humbert, was dedicated to becoming bishop. At the end of his life, Guigues retired to Cluny in Burgundy where he died in 1070.

According to Thomas Heinz in his book \\"The Vision of Frank Lloyd Wright\\", Donald Schaberg worked in the lumber industry in Lansing, Michigan. The Schabergs had been friends with the Edwards family before, and when the Edwards commissioned Wright to design them a house (James Edwards House), and the Schabergs liked what they saw, the Schabergs commissioned Wright to design a home for themselves. Don and Mary Lou Schaberg visited Wright at his home, Taliesin, so that the architect could understand the needs of the young couple better. It took many months and many reminder notes before Wright would send the plans for their new home. But when they came it was worth the wait. As Wright wrote, \\"your patience will be rewarded this side of heaven\\". Wright designed the house in 1950, and the Schabergs built the house in 1957. It was completed in 1958. The Schabergs commissioned John H. \\"Jack\\" Howe, Wright's right-hand man, to design an addition to the house that was finished in 1964. In 1968, Schaberg designed and had built a 40-foot tower adjoining the home. An inground swimming pool (pictured) was built in 1973. Wright's other area work * Erling P.

Ice jams can significantly reduce the flow of a river and cause upstream flooding‚Äîsometimes called ice dams. Ice jam flooding can also occur downstream when the jam releases in an outburst flood. In either case, flooding can cause damage to structures on shore. Overview Eagle, Alaska, inundated by flood water and ice floes after an ice jam formed downstream on the Yukon River. An ice blockage on a river is usually called an ice jam, but sometimes an ice dam.\\"Ice dam\\". def. 1. Monkhouse, Francis J.. A dictionary of geography: 2nd ed.. Leeds: E.J. Arnold, 1970. 182. An ice jam is an obstruction on a river formed by blocks of ice. Defined by the International Association of Hydraulic Research (IAHR) Working Group on River Ice Hydraulics an ice jam is a \\"stationary accumulation of fragmented ice or frazil that restricts flow\\" on a river or stream. The jam may effectively create a dam with an accumulation of anchor ice on the bottom of the river. On rivers the obstruction may be a change of width, structure, bend or decrease in gradient. Ice jam floods are less predictable and potentially more destructive than open-water flooding and can produce much deeper and faster flooding. Ice jam floods also may occur during freezing weather, and may leave large pieces of ice behind, but they are much more localized than open-water floods. Ice jams also damage an economy by causing river-side industrial facilities such as hydro-electric generating stations to shut down and to interfere with ship transport. The United States averages 125 million dollars in losses to ice jams per year. Mechanisms Ice floes/cakes left over on a river bank after an ice jam Ice jams on rivers usually occur in the springtime as the river ice begins to break up, but may also occur in early winter during freeze-up. The break-up process is described in three phases: pre-break-up, break-up and final drive. Pre-break-up usually begins with increased springtime river flow, water level, and temperatures fracturing the river ice and separating it from the shore. Changes in river height from dam releases may also affect the pre-break-up. During the break-up, the ice in areas of rapids is carried downstream as an ice floe and may jam on still frozen sections of ice on calm water or against structures in the river such as the Honeymoon Bridge, destroyed in 1938 by an ice jam. Smaller jams may dislodge, flow downstream and form a larger jam. During the final drive, a large jam will dislodge and take out the remaining jams, clearing the river of ice in a matter of hours. Ice jams usually occur in spring, but they can happen as winter sets in when the downstream part becomes frozen first. Freeze-up jams may be larger because the ice is stronger and temperatures are continuing to cool unlike a spring break-up when the environment is warming, but are less likely to suddenly release water. Three types of natural ice jams can occur: # a surface jam, a single layer of ice in a floe on calm water; # a narrow-channel or wide-channel jam; and # a hanging jam, the accumulation of river ice at slow current areas which only occur during freeze-up. Ice jams also occur at sharp bends in the river, at man-made objects such as bridge piers, and at confluences. Occurrences and consequences Children standing on Ice Jam in the Maumee River, Toledo, Ohio In the northern hemisphere, northerly flowing rivers tend to have more ice jams because the upper, more southerly reaches thaw first and the ice gets carried downstream into the still-frozen northerly part. There are three physical hazards of ice jams. The ice floe can form a dam that floods the areas upstream of the jam. This occurred during the 2009 Red River Flood and the 2009 Alaska floods. The second type of hazard occurs as the ice jam breaks apart, and a sudden surge of water breaks through flooding areas downstream of the jam . Such a surge occurred on the St. Lawrence River in 1848. The third hazard is that the ice buildup and final drive may damage structures in or near the river and boats in the river. Ice jams may scour the river bed, causing damage or benefit to wildlife habitats and possibly damage to structures in the river. Prediction and mitigation Model of a structure built to retain river ice upstream of a site on Cazenovia Creek that was the cause of ice jams during river thaws. Early warnings of an ice jam include using trained observers to monitor break-up conditions and ice motion detectors. The prevention of ice jams may be accomplished by # weakening the ice before the break-up by cutting or drilling holes in the ice; # weakening the ice by dusting it with a dark colored sand; or # controlling the timing of the break-up using ice breakers, towboats, hovercraft, or amphibious excavators. However, the movement of migratory fish is known to be related to freeze-up and break-up, so affecting ice break-up may affect fish migration. Where floods threaten human habitation, the blockage may be artificially cleared. Ice blasting using dynamite may be used, except in urban areas, as well as other mechanical means such as excavation equipment, or permanent measures such as ice control structures and flood control. Occasionally, military aircraft have been used to bomb ice jams with limited success as part of an effort to clear them.

It was located in San Francisco near the Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero. Its central features were two oversized sets of 6 stairs with large concrete ledges on both sides. The spot is part of a pedestrian walkway but was more commonly used by the local skateboarders and vagrants. The city of San Francisco made numerous attempts over the years to ward off skateboarders from the spot, and in January 2011 city workers completely demolished its ledges and stairs. Etymology Hubba Hideout got its handle because of the nefarious denizens that would frequent the skate spot looking for a hidden place to engage in illicit activity. The nickname was a nod to the Bay Area slang term for crack cocaine: \\"hubbas.\\" Appearing in numerous skateboard videos and attracting a wide following, the Hubba Hideout eventually gained such popularity among skaters that the term \\"hubba\\" became synonymous with any type of concrete ledge that leads down a stairway. History The first documented trick on the ledge at Hubba Hideout was Wade Speyer's crooked grind. Hubba Hideout gained fame through skateboarding magazines and videos and it became a mecca for advanced skateboarders visiting San Francisco. The frequency of skateboarders eventually attracted the attention of the authorities and resulted in a full-scale skate-stopper implementation (in the late part of the nineties). The ledges were capped (or knobbed) with skate-stopping devices which rendered them impossible to grind. Recently, skateboarders managed to remove the skate-stopping devices and use of the ledges had a resurgence. Eventually, in March 2007, the authorities had the brick landing taken out and covered it in sand. However, this has not rendered the spot un-skateable. A rather simple impromptu set-up of wood or other material replacing the brick landing will suffice for the initial impact. A clean ride-away across the sand is definitely possible after that initial landing.

In terms of time, Time on Target is also a reference to the period of time that a radar illuminates a target during a scan. It is closely associated with Dwell period. There may be multiple dwell periods within the Time on Target period. Origins A technique called Time on Target was developed by the British Army in North Africa at the end of 1941 and early 1942 particularly for counter-battery fire and other concentrations; it proved very popular. It relied on BBC time signals to enable officers to synchronize their watches to the second because this avoided the need to use military radio networks and the possibility of losing surprise, and furthermore for the need for additional field telephone networks in the desert. It had been found during World War I that most of the casualties in an artillery bombardment occur within the first few seconds. During those first few seconds, troops may be in the open and may not be prone. After that, enemy troops have gone prone and/or sought cover. This dramatically lessens the casualties from shrapnel or high explosive blast. World War II Allied artillery units were often trained to fire their guns in a precise order, so that all shells would hit a target at the same time, delivering the maximum possible damage.

He is known for the concept of abnormal illness behaviour, writings around pain and somatoform disorders. Doctors can find patients who express their symptoms in unusual ways problematic to manage and Pilowsky's work has proven useful in assisting medical practitioners and other in this difficult territory. Pilowsky obtained a medical degree in South Africa before developing an interest in the experience of pain when working under the well respected psychiatrist Erwin Stengel in Sheffield, England. He later worked in universities in Sydney and Adelaide, Australia. Pilowsky made a significant contribution to the medical literature through the development of the concept known as abnormal illness behaviour. When a person becomes unwell, they take on the sick role as defined by Talcott Parsons. Those who have accepted the sick role demonstrate that they are unwell through illness behaviour. Mechanic and Volkart had previously formulated the term illness behaviour. Certain individuals may manifest illness behaviour which is outside the range of that normally accepted by their society. Pilowsky had previously been struck by general hospital patients who were totally preoccupied by their pain or alternatively seemed almost completely oblivious to their plight. Accordingly, abnormal illness behaviour may be illness denying or illness affirming, that is minimising or excessive relative to the prevailing norms. Pilowsky developed the Illness Behaviour Questionnaire, a research instrument which can be used to measure the dimensions of abnormal illness behaviour.Pilowsky I, Spence ND. (1983) Manual for the illness behaviour questionnaire (IBQ). 2nd ed. Adelaide: University of Adelaide. In 1991 he was made a Member of the Order of Australia for \\"service to medicine, particularly in the field of psychiatry\\". He was elected Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 1990. Pilowsky died in 2012 of a brain tumor.

In Scotland and in the legal sense, puberty is at the age of 12 for girls and 14 for the age of males. Definition: \\"A crime at common law for any person to indulge in indecent practises towards children under the age of puberty, whether they are consenting or not\\". Examples of this could include indecently exposing private parts of a female or male to young children, improper handling of the private parts of children, inducing children to handle the private parts of others and taking indecent photographs of children. = Public Indecency = Indecent conduct could be constituted as being criminal in some circumstances, e.g. indecent exposure, sexual intercourse in public view. The public element of the offence is not that it must take place in public but that it is a crime against public morals.Webster v. Dominick [2003] ScotHC HCJ 67 The offence could be committed almost anywhere, including the person's own home if it could be seen through an open window by a person outside. Determination of indecency will depend on the time and place. For example, certain sex theatre shows are not illegal as they are advertised as such and should therefore not be offensive to the public if in enclosed viewing. So long as the public as aware of the content of the show, it would not be regarded as public indecency. = Indecent Assault = Indecent assault an aggravation of the common law offence of assault, aggravated by the indecent manner in which it is committed. An assault may be indecent irrespective of the intention or motive of the accused and it does not need to be shown that the accused committed the assault for sexual gratification.Grainger v.

The term 'slipper launch' derives from the distinctive shape of the sloping stern which, combined with a very flat underwater run aft, is intended to minimise wash. These popular launches began to be more widely introduced in the 1930s with classical designs from Meakes of Marlow and later from Andrews of Bourne End during the 1950s. The prototype, Merk, however, was built some years earlier, in 1912 by Andrews at Maidenhead. This boat, now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum, Cornwall was owned at one time by Arthur Whitten Brown, famous with John Alcock for the first non-stop transatlantic flight in 1919. Slipper launches have also been owned by other famous names, including one by the British 1950's singing trio, the Beverley Sisters and another by Louis Renault, of car company fame. In the 1960s and 1970s launches were also built by Alf Parrott at Henley-on-Thames. Alf Parrott slipper launches were initially built in marine ply then later in fibreglass, in length with Stuart Turner single-cylinder petrol engines. Alf Parrott launches can still be seen on the River Thames.  Construction and hull architecture  During a renovation project the hull shape and construction can be viewed along with the rarely seen framing of the slipper stern. The hull boards and stringers sealing the gap between covering each plank are made from mahogany. Lateral frames spaced at approximately 1 metre centres are formed from oak. The deck over is constructed of afromosia with multiple layers of varnish providing a furniture like finish.

The date, March 18, was referred to by Chinese writer Lu Xun as the \\"darkest day since the founding of the Republic\\". Background In November 1925 the Anti- Fengtian War broke out in northern China between the Soviet-backed Guominjun and the Japanese-backed Fengtian clique. By early 1926 the war was going badly for the Guominjun and, on March 8, they blockaded and mined Dagu harbor in defense of Tianjin. On March 12 a Japanese warship bombarded the Taku Forts in support of the Fengtian offensive, killing several Guominjun troops guarding the forts. In retaliation, Guominjun troops fired back and drove the warship out of the Tanggu harbor. The act was treated by Japan as a violation of the Boxer Protocol, signed in 1900 in the aftermath of the Boxer Rebellion. Four days later ambassadors representing eight countries that were signatory nations to the Protocol sent an ultimatum to the Beiyang Government under Duan Qirui. The demand was that the Duan government should destroy all defense establishments on the Taku Forts. Events Students and soldiers outside Duan Qirui's presidential office on the Iron Lion Hutong, now Zhang Zizhong Road on March 18, 1926. A demonstration was organized in front of the Tiananmen Gate on March 18. Li Dazhao, the leader of the demonstrators, made an emotional address. He called for an end to all unequal treaties signed between China and the foreign powers, in addition to expelling foreign ambassadors who issued the ultimatum. The Nationalist army, which was based in Guangzhou at the time, was urged to confront possible imperialist incursions since the Beiyang Government was unwilling to. A subsequent march by the protesters ended on a square in front of Beiyang Government headquarters. Duan Qirui, who was worried about the situation becoming destabilized, ordered armed military police to disperse the protesters. The confrontation led to violence, in which 47 protesters were killed and more than 200 injured. Those who died included Liu Hezhen, a student of the Female Normal University of Peking. Li Dazhao was also wounded during the massacre. Aftermath It was reported at the time that Duan Qirui personally went to the square where the massacre took place and knelt at the site in front of the dead bodies of the protesters. Both the communist and nationalist organizers of the event were hunted down after the massacre. The warlord Zhang Zuolin also ordered many schools in Beiping to be searched for any books or periodicals affiliated with either the Kuomintang or the Communist Party of China. Enormous public pressure forced the Duan government to open an emergency meeting of the parliament. A resolution was passed calling for the punishment of those responsible for the massacre. In April 1926 the Duan government was ousted by the Guominjun. Many memorials were built since the event. Some of them are located in prestigious universities such as the Tsinghua and the Peking.

Patrick O'Donoghue, the Bishop of Lancaster, \\"A Pilgrimage to Skirwith!\\", in John Bradburne Memorial Society Newsletter, Winter 2004, p. 2 A son of the marriage of Thomas William Bradburne and Erica May Hill in 1916,\\"Bradburne, Thomas W & Hill, Erica M.\\" in Register of Marriages for Watford Registration District, vol. 3a (1916), p. 1688 he was baptised in the Church of England at Skirwith on 31 July 1921. He had two brothers and two sisters. Their father, an Anglican clergyman, was Rector of Skirwith. The Bradburnes were cousins of the playwright Terence Rattigan and were more distantly related to the politician Christopher Soames. Education Bradburne was educated at Gresham's, an independent school in Norfolk, from 1934 to 1939, after his father had gained a new benefice in Norfolk. His brother Michael was at Gresham's with him, but moved on to Eton. Bradburne was a member of the school's Officers' Training Corps. He was planning to continue his studies at a university, but at the outset of the Second World War he volunteered for the Indian Army, with which his mother's family was connected. She had been born in Lucknow. He was accepted and sent for training at an Officer Cadet Training Unit at Bulford Camp. John Dove, Strange Vagabond of God: The Story of John Bradburne, p. 5 War service In December 1940 Bradburne was commissioned in the Indian Army. He was assigned to the 9th Gurkha Rifles of the Indian Army and soon posted with them to British Malaya to face the invasion of the Imperial Japanese Army. After the fall of Singapore in February 1942, Bradburne spent a month in the jungle. With another Gurkha officer, he tried to sail a sampan to Sumatra but they were shipwrecked. A second attempt was successful, and Bradburne was rescued by a Royal Navy destroyer and returned to Dehra Dun in India. For his escape, he was recommended for the Military Cross, although this was never awarded. He then saw active service with Orde Wingate's Chindits in Burma. After the war Bradburne relinquished his commission in March 1946, on account of ill- health. Bradburne had a religious experience in Malaya, and the adventurer became the pilgrim. When he returned to England after the war, he stayed with the Benedictines of Buckfast Abbey, where he became a Roman Catholic in 1947. He wanted to be a Benedictine monk but the Order would not accept him because he had not been in the Church for two years.(en) Joan Carroll Cruz, Saintly Men of Modern Times, p. 164 After a while, he felt a strong urge to travel. For the next sixteen years, Bradburne wandered through England, France, Italy, Greece and the Middle East with only a Gladstone bag. In England, he stayed with the Carthusians for seven months. In Israel, he joined the small Order of Our Lady of Mount Sion, and went as a novice to Leuven (Louvain), Belgium, for a year, where he met G√©za Vermes who became a noted scholar. After that, he walked to Rome and lived for a year in the organ loft of the small church in a mountain village, playing the organ. He tried to live as a hermit on Dartmoor, then went to the Benedictine Prinknash Abbey, before joining the choir of Westminster Cathedral as a sacristan. Cardinal Godfrey asked him to be the caretaker of his country house, Hare Street House, in Hertfordshire. On Good Friday 1956, Bradburne joined the Secular Franciscan Order but remained a layman. However, he decided he wanted to be buried in the habit of Francis of Assisi. Bradburne's wanderlust was coming to the end in 1962, when he wrote to a Jesuit friend in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Fr John Dove SJ. He asked, \\"Is there a cave in Africa where I can pray?\\" The answer was the invitation to come to Rhodesia and be a missionary helper. This is where in 1969, Bradburne found Mutemwa Leprosy Settlement near Mutoko, 143 kilometres (89 miles) northeast of Salisbury (now Harare). It was a cut-off community of leprosy patients abandoned by others. Here Bradburne stayed with these patients until his murder in 1979. He cared for them as their warden but fell out with the Leprosy Association and was expelled from the colony. He stayed in a tin hut, just outside the perimeter fence, for the last six years of his life but continued to minister to the lepers. After his arrival to Africa, Bradburne told a Franciscan priest that he had three wishes: to help the victims of leprosy, to die a martyr, and to be buried in the Franciscan habit.(en) Ibid., p. 166 Death By July 1979, the Rhodesian Bush War, then in its 15th and last year, was approaching Mutemwa. His friends urged Bradburne to leave but he insisted that he should stay with the lepers. On 2 September 1979, guerrillas of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army abducted him. He was shot and died on 5 September at the age of 58. He was buried in a Franciscan habit, according to his wishes, at the Chishawasha Mission Cemetery, about 18 kilometres (11 miles) northeast of Salisbury (now Harare).(en) Ibid., pp. 167‚Äì169 Legacy Feature articles on Bradburne and Mutemwa appeared in the Sunday Telegraph on 23 April 1989, 28 August 1994 and 14 September 2009. The last two articles were written by the newspaper's editor, Charles Moore, who had visited Mutemwa. In July 2001, the Franciscan priest Father Paschal Slevin, OFM, presented a petition to Patrick Fani Chakaipa, Archbishop of Harare, for an inquiry into Bradburne's canonisation. Father Slevin commented: \\"I have no doubt that John died a martyr in his determination to serve his friends, the lepers. If his martyrdom is accepted, his cause for sainthood could go quite quickly\\".Spectator (UK), \\"Letter from Zimbabwe\\", ZWNews.com, Friday, 29 June 2001 A service is held in Bradburne's memory at Mutemwa every year, drawing as many as 25,000 people each time. In 2009 a Mass commemorating the 30th anniversary of his death was held at Westminster Cathedral in London. \\"London: John Bradburne: Anniversary Mass and Talk\\", Independent Catholic News, 5 September 2009, https://www.indcatholicnews.com/news/14768 The 40th Anniversary of Bradburne's assassination was marked both at Mutemwa with the pilgrimage and then an exhibition and talks at Westminster Cathedral on 21 September 2019, where his relics were showcased for the first time. He left behind 6,000 poems.Johnbradburnepoems.com He is in the Guinness World Records for being in terms of lines of poetry alone, the most prolific poet in English. Comprising a total of 169,925 individual lines. Bradburne's output almost doubles that of William Shakespeare. Most of his poems were written after 1968 and cover a wide range of spiritual, natural, elegiac and narrative subject matter. As he wrote his domestic letters largely in verse, new poems from the recipients are still occasionally found. A campaign to have Bradburne beatified and canonised was started by the late Celia Brigstocke, John's niece and continued by Kate Macpherson, his great niece. On 1 July 2019 the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome issued a formal nihil obstat for the cause of beatification of Bradburne to proceed. The letter was sent to Archbishop Robert Ndlovu, primate of Zimbabwe, who in April 2019 had convened a meeting of Zimbabwean Bishops at which there was unanimous approval to support the cause. A postulator, Dr Enrico Solinas, a lay judge at the Umbrian Interdiocesan Ecclesiastical Court of Perugia, was appointed in 2018 and is taking the cause forward. On 5 September 2019, the 40th anniversary of Bradburne's death, a special ceremony was held at Mutemwa to officially launch the cause.

It is one of the premier acts of the Belgian black metal scene.  History  The band was founded in 1993 by drummer Cernunnos. He soon recruited guitarist Tsebaoth and a vocalist from grindcore/black metal band Hecate who stayed until the end of December 1993. Then bassist/vocalist Sabathan joined. The band released a five-track demo tape in mid-1994 which brought them to the attention of several independent labels. A 7-inch split EP with Ancient Rites was then released by the underground label Afterdark Records. After the label's demise, Evil Alliance Records (a sub-label of Osmose Productions) released Enthroned's first full-length release, Prophecies of Pagan Fire. Shortly thereafter, the band enlisted second guitarist Nornagest. Eventually, Tseboath was replaced by Nebiros. In 1996, along with Ancient Rites and Bewitched, Enthroned began an extensive tour of Europe. In April 1997, as Enthroned was to begin recording Towards the Skullthrone of Satan, Cernunnos committed suicide by hanging himself. He was 25 years old. Enthroned recorded the album with a session drummer in honor of Cernunnos and performed at the Dragons Blaze festival with newly acquired drummer Namroth Blackthorn. In April 1998, the band toured the European continent with Dark Funeral and also released the mini CD Regie Sathanas: A Tribute to Cernunnos, which was dedicated to their former drummer Cernunnos. Later that year, they toured again with labelmates Hecate Enthroned and Usurper. At the close of 1998, the band entered Abyss Studios (Sweden) to record The Apocalypse Manifesto. The band's third album was released in May 1999 and dealt with the biblical concept of the Apocalypse as interpreted by a Norse mythological perspective. Enthroned rounded off the 20th Century on tour with Marduk and continued to tour in Europe. In 2000, the band parted ways with Nebiros and recruited Nerath Daemon as their new guitarist, went on a German mini tour followed by several other European shows and recorded Armoured Bestial Hell at Real Sound Studio (Germany). This fourth album was released in April 2001. Namroth Blackthorn was replaced by Alsvid from the French black metal band Seth. Enthroned continued to play many live gigs in and around Europe, as well as in the US. In early 2002, Enthroned signed to Napalm Records releasing their fifth full-length recording, Carnage in Worlds Beyond, later that year. In June 2003, Nguaroth (guitars) and Glaurung (drums) joined Enthroned, which played a South American tour and released their sixth album, XES Haereticum. In 2005, Enthroned released their first official live album, Black Goat Ritual, recorded during their tour of Brazil. Enthroned parted ways with longtime vocalist Sabathan, at which time Nornagest took over the vocals and Phorgath joined the band on bass. In June 2007, Enthroned recorded their seventh album Tetra Karcist, seeing the return of old drummer Alsvid for the studio sessions. Ahephahim joined as the new official drummer in June 2007 and Enthroned signed with Regain Records in January 2008. At this time, some members of the band opened a recording studio, Blackout Multimedia. In the meantime, Ahephaim and Nguaroth left the band due to lack of time and were replaced by ex-Gorgoroth drummer Garghuf. Nerath Daemon took back the position he left five years ago in Enthroned, changing his name to Neraath. Enthroned's eight album, Pentagrammaton, was released on 22 March 2010. Since then, Nornagest has given up playing guitar in live performances, due to chronic tendonitis in his wrist, and has instead become the band's frontman. Former members Lord Sabathan and Nguaroth joined the band for a one-off live performance in 2010 as an act of reconciliation. In September 2011, Enthroned announced that their collaboration with Regain Records had ended while the band was busy recording their ninth studio album which was titled Obsidium and was released on 10 March 2012 through Agonia Records. On 15 April 2014 Enthroned released their tenth studio album; Sovereigns. In 2016, long time bassist Phorgath and guitarist ZarZax departed the band on amicable terms, and were replaced by Norgaath and Shag√£l respectively for live shows and officially joined the band in 2018. In 2017, Enthroned ended their contract with Agonia Records. According to Nornagest the band's eleventh studio album has been on the works since 2017. In December 2018 the band announced on their Facebook page alongside their 25th anniversary post that their next album will be released on 2019. In January 2019 Enthroned announced that they have signed with Season of Mist to release their new album as well as future projects. They will also embark on a world tour to support the album. On March 20 2019, Cold Black Suns was revealed as the title of their eleventh album which was released on June 7th. On April 15 the band released a music video for the song \\"Hosanna Satana\\". On October 1, 2019 the band announced that guitarist ZarZax had rejoined the band since Shag√£l decided to leave Enthroned in order to focus on his band, Vibrion.

Description The Nordmann's greenshank is a medium-sized sandpiper, at long, with a slightly upturned, bicoloured bill, and relatively short yellow legs. Breeding adults are boldly marked, with whitish spots and spangling on black upperside; heavily streaked head and upper neck; broad, blackish, crescentic spots on lower neck and breast; and darker lores. left Distribution The Nordmann's greenshank breeds in eastern Russia along the south-western and northern coasts of the Sea of Okhotsk and on Sakhalin Island. Its non-breeding range is not fully understood, but significant numbers have been recorded in South Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on passage, and in Bangladesh, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Peninsular Malaysia in winter. It has also been recorded on passage or in winter in Japan, North Korea, India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar (which may prove to be an important part of its wintering range), Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia. There are unconfirmed records from Nepal and Guam (to US). It probably has a population of 500‚Äì1,000 individuals. Taxonomy It is fairly aberrant and was formerly placed in the monotypic genus Pseudototanus. It is an endangered species, and was not available for molecular analyses in Pereira & Baker's study (2005) of the genus Tringa. It appears closest overall to the semipalmata-flavipes and the stagnatilis- totanus-glareola groups, though it also has some similarities to the greater yellowlegs and common greenshank.

The case stands for the proposition that an express choice of law clause in a contract should be honoured as long as the agreement was bona fide and not against public policy. The case is significant in the field of contract law, as it greatly expanded the ability of parties to choose the jurisdiction of their contacts. Facts Three lots of herring were accepted by the Hurry On (owned by Unus Shipping, a Nova Scotia corporation) at Middle Arm, Newfoundland for shipment to Vita Foods of New York. The bills of lading which, the judgment states, \\"[b]y some error or inadvertence ... were old ones used outside Newfoundland\\", provided for exemption from liability for master‚Äôs negligence in navigation which was allowed under the Hague Rules, which further provided that any clause or agreement in the bills of lading relieving the carrier from liability for negligence imposed by the Rules was void. There was a further provision in the bills of lading that, in the case of shipment from the United States, the Harter Act should apply and that, unless otherwise provided, the bill of lading was subject to the terms of the Canadian Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1910. Finally the bills of lading contained the following clause: \\"This contract shall be governed by English law.\\" The bills of lading for these lots did not conform to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1932 (Newfoundland), which required that they contain an express clause paramount that the Hague Rules applied. During the voyage, the ship ran into bad weather and ice off Nova Scotia and went ashore in a gale of wind. The ship was eventually set free, and made for Guysborough, where the cargo was unloaded, reconditioned and forwarded by another ship to New York, where Vita took delivery of the cargo in its damaged condition and paid for the freight. Vita sued Unus in Nova Scotia for the damage to the cargo, salvage and other expenses. It also alleged that the Hurry On was unseaworthy, and that the bills of lading were illegal because they did not contain an express clause adopting the Hague Rules, and thus was subject to the liabilities of a common carrier. Unus, in its defence, asserted that, as the bills stated that they would be governed by English law, the Hague Rules were incorporated by reference, as they were the ones in force under the English Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924. Advice =Supreme Court of Nova Scotia= In the original action before the Chief Justice, which was upheld on appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, the allegation of unseaworthiness was rejected, but it was accepted that the loss was due to the captain's negligence in navigation. The contention that the bills of lading were illegal was rejected in addition, the Court also held that if the bills of lading were held to be illegal, the parties were in pari delicto and on that ground the action must fail. =Privy Council= The Nova Scotia decision was upheld by the Privy Council, albeit for different reasons. Lord Wright, writing for the Council, noted that the following provisions of the bills in question did not apply: * the Harter Act requirement only applied to shipments from the United States * the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1910 (Canada) only applied to shipments from Canadian ports, whether to other Canadian ports or ports outside Canada (at this time Newfoundland was an independent Dominion; it did not become part of Canada until 1949).

The glacier is situated on the eastern cliffs of Mount Moran and is easily seen from Jackson Hole. The shape of the glacier led to the naming as the uppermost section of the glacier is long and narrow and then broadens abruptly more than halfway down the mountain into a larger area, giving it the shape of a skillet or frying pan. The glacier is one of twelve that remain in Grand Teton National Park and one of five glaciers located on Mount Moran. Mountain climbers consider the Skillet Glacier route to be the fastest and one of the easiest ways to climb Mount Moran, and was the route taken when the peak was first climbed in 1922, though it is rarely used in late summer due to poor footing. On November 21, 1950, A DC-3 crashed into Mount Moran, adjacent to Skillet Glacier, killing all 21 passengers aboard. The remains of the passengers and the plane are still on the mountain.

History  In 1947, the 2nd Colonial Commando Parachute Battalion 2eB.C.C.P was posted to Indochina, combat engaging until 1953 in two rounds (1947-1949 and 1950-1953), being cited three times at the orders of the armed forces. In 1954, the 2nd Colonial Parachute Battalion 2e BPC made way to Morocco and was then subsequently dissolved on July 31, 1955. In 1955, the regiment was redesignated as the 2nd Colonial Parachute Regiment 2e RPC by regrouping the dissolved components of the 1e BPC, 5e BPC and 8e BPC and then in 1958, designated again as the 2nd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment. The unit served from 1955 until 1962 in North Africa at the corps 10th Parachute Division. On 5 November 1956, the unit jumped in the second wave of the French/British attack on the Suez Canal over Port Said and was cited at the orders of the armed forces. In July 1961, the regiment jumped over Bizerte and broke the Tunisian siege of the French airport installations. The regiment was then dissolved on 5 July 1962 and recreated 1 January 1965 in Ivato, Madagascar from the 5th Marine Infantry Parachute Battalion 5e BPIM. The regiment was then transferred to Reunion in 1973. Since then, the regiment has participated in various operations: Djibouti (1993/1994), Comoros (1990), Rwanda (1994) and Comors (1995/1996). In May and October 2009 the regiment performed a parachute jump and participated in a major military exercise in the Bay of Saint-Paul with GAM (Groupe d'assaut par mer).Saut en parachute au-dessus de la baie(Photos) , 'Le Quotidien de la R√©union', 20 May 2009Bizerte: Les grandes man≈ìuvres du 2e RPIMA(Photos), 'Le Quotidien de la R√©union', 7 October 2009  Traditions  The Archangel Michael featured in Mont Saint-Michel and the Insignia of the 9th Parachute Chasseur Regiment.

Thread #1 is executed first, eventually starts Thread #2, and waits for a response. When Thread #2 finishes, it signals Thread #1 to resume execution to completion and then finishes. In computer architecture, multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system. This approach differs from multiprocessing. In a multithreaded application, the threads share the resources of a single or multiple cores, which include the computing units, the CPU caches, and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB). Where multiprocessing systems include multiple complete processing units in one or more cores, multithreading aims to increase utilization of a single core by using thread-level parallelism, as well as instruction-level parallelism. As the two techniques are complementary, they are sometimes combined in systems with multiple multithreading CPUs and with CPUs with multiple multithreading cores. Overview The multithreading paradigm has become more popular as efforts to further exploit instruction-level parallelism have stalled since the late 1990s. This allowed the concept of throughput computing to re-emerge from the more specialized field of transaction processing. Even though it is very difficult to further speed up a single thread or single program, most computer systems are actually multitasking among multiple threads or programs. Thus, techniques that improve the throughput of all tasks result in overall performance gains. Two major techniques for throughput computing are multithreading and multiprocessing. =Advantages= If a thread gets a lot of cache misses, the other threads can continue taking advantage of the unused computing resources, which may lead to faster overall execution, as these resources would have been idle if only a single thread were executed. Also, if a thread cannot use all the computing resources of the CPU (because instructions depend on each other's result), running another thread may prevent those resources from becoming idle. =Disadvantages= Multiple threads can interfere with each other when sharing hardware resources such as caches or translation lookaside buffers (TLBs). As a result, execution times of a single thread are not improved and can be degraded, even when only one thread is executing, due to lower frequencies or additional pipeline stages that are necessary to accommodate thread-switching hardware. Overall efficiency varies; Intel claims up to 30% improvement with its Hyper-Threading Technology, while a synthetic program just performing a loop of non-optimized dependent floating-point operations actually gains a 100% speed improvement when run in parallel. On the other hand, hand-tuned assembly language programs using MMX or AltiVec extensions and performing data prefetches (as a good video encoder might) do not suffer from cache misses or idle computing resources. Such programs therefore do not benefit from hardware multithreading and can indeed see degraded performance due to contention for shared resources. From the software standpoint, hardware support for multithreading is more visible to software, requiring more changes to both application programs and operating systems than multiprocessing. Hardware techniques used to support multithreading often parallel the software techniques used for computer multitasking. Thread scheduling is also a major problem in multithreading. Types of multithreading =Interleaved/Temporal multithreading= Coarse-grained multithreading The simplest type of multithreading occurs when one thread runs until it is blocked by an event that normally would create a long-latency stall. Such a stall might be a cache miss that has to access off-chip memory, which might take hundreds of CPU cycles for the data to return. Instead of waiting for the stall to resolve, a threaded processor would switch execution to another thread that was ready to run. Only when the data for the previous thread had arrived, would the previous thread be placed back on the list of ready-to-run threads. For example: # Cycle : instruction from thread is issued. # Cycle : instruction from thread is issued. # Cycle : instruction from thread is issued, which is a load instruction that misses in all caches. # Cycle : thread scheduler invoked, switches to thread . # Cycle : instruction from thread is issued. # Cycle : instruction from thread is issued. Conceptually, it is similar to cooperative multi-tasking used in real-time operating systems, in which tasks voluntarily give up execution time when they need to wait upon some type of the event. This type of multithreading is known as block, cooperative or coarse-grained multithreading. The goal of multithreading hardware support is to allow quick switching between a blocked thread and another thread ready to run. To achieve this goal, the hardware cost is to replicate the program visible registers, as well as some processor control registers (such as the program counter). Switching from one thread to another thread means the hardware switches from using one register set to another; to switch efficiently between active threads, each active thread needs to have its own register set. For example, to quickly switch between two threads, the register hardware needs to be instantiated twice. Additional hardware support for multithreading allows thread switching to be done in one CPU cycle, bringing performance improvements. Also, additional hardware allows each thread to behave as if it were executing alone and not sharing any hardware resources with other threads, minimizing the amount of software changes needed within the application and the operating system to support multithreading. Many families of microcontrollers and embedded processors have multiple register banks to allow quick context switching for interrupts. Such schemes can be considered a type of block multithreading among the user program thread and the interrupt threads. Interleaved multithreading The purpose of interleaved multithreading is to remove all data dependency stalls from the execution pipeline. Since one thread is relatively independent from other threads, there is less chance of one instruction in one pipelining stage needing an output from an older instruction in the pipeline. Conceptually, it is similar to preemptive multitasking used in operating systems; an analogy would be that the time slice given to each active thread is one CPU cycle. For example: # Cycle : an instruction from thread is issued. # Cycle : an instruction from thread is issued. This type of multithreading was first called barrel processing, in which the staves of a barrel represent the pipeline stages and their executing threads. Interleaved, preemptive, fine- grained or time-sliced multithreading are more modern terminology. In addition to the hardware costs discussed in the block type of multithreading, interleaved multithreading has an additional cost of each pipeline stage tracking the thread ID of the instruction it is processing. Also, since there are more threads being executed concurrently in the pipeline, shared resources such as caches and TLBs need to be larger to avoid thrashing between the different threads. =Simultaneous multithreading= The most advanced type of multithreading applies to superscalar processors. Whereas a normal superscalar processor issues multiple instructions from a single thread every CPU cycle, in simultaneous multithreading (SMT) a superscalar processor can issue instructions from multiple threads every CPU cycle. Recognizing that any single thread has a limited amount of instruction-level parallelism, this type of multithreading tries to exploit parallelism available across multiple threads to decrease the waste associated with unused issue slots. For example: # Cycle : instructions and from thread and instruction from thread are simultaneously issued. # Cycle : instruction from thread , instruction from thread , and instruction from thread are all simultaneously issued. # Cycle : instruction from thread and instructions and from thread are all simultaneously issued. To distinguish the other types of multithreading from SMT, the term \\"temporal multithreading\\" is used to denote when instructions from only one thread can be issued at a time. In addition to the hardware costs discussed for interleaved multithreading, SMT has the additional cost of each pipeline stage tracking the thread ID of each instruction being processed. Again, shared resources such as caches and TLBs have to be sized for the large number of active threads being processed. Implementations include DEC (later Compaq) EV8 (not completed), Intel Hyper-Threading Technology, IBM POWER5, Sun Microsystems UltraSPARC T2, Cray XMT, and AMD Bulldozer and Zen microarchitectures. Implementation specifics A major area of research is the thread scheduler that must quickly choose from among the list of ready-to-run threads to execute next, as well as maintain the ready-to-run and stalled thread lists. An important subtopic is the different thread priority schemes that can be used by the scheduler. The thread scheduler might be implemented totally in software, totally in hardware, or as a hardware/software combination. Another area of research is what type of events should cause a thread switch: cache misses, inter-thread communication, DMA completion, etc. If the multithreading scheme replicates all of the software-visible state, including privileged control registers and TLBs, then it enables virtual machines to be created for each thread. This allows each thread to run its own operating system on the same processor. On the other hand, if only user-mode state is saved, then less hardware is required, which would allow more threads to be active at one time for the same die area or cost.

It covers over ; within this area is the old village of Albury, which consists of three or four houses and a church. The River Tillingbourne runs through the grounds. The gardens of Albury Park are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Pre-1890 St Peter and St Paul Church in Albury Estate The Saxon Old St Peter and St Paul's Church, within the grounds of Albury Park, predates 1066. Albury Park was mentioned in the Domesday Book. Over the centuries the estate has changed hands many times.Albury history The grounds of Albury Park were laid out by John Evelyn, the 17th century diarist and landscape gardener between 1655 and 1677.York University He lived nearby at Wotton. At this time the park was owned by Henry Howard who later became the 6th Duke of Norfolk. John Evelyn's work included a yew walk, a vineyard, a terrace a quarter of a mile long, and a 160-yard tunnel, through the hill under Silver Wood. Beneath the terrace was a chamber built in imitation of a Roman bath, with niches for sculpture. He also designed a wide canal fed by the River Tillingbourne; it was drained in the early nineteenth century. Many of Evelyn's alterations to the mansion were destroyed in a fire in 1697. At that time the owner was Heneage Finch who later became the first Earl of Aylesford and Solicitor- General to Charles II. Finch rebuilt the mansion. In 1761, Albury Park was the scene of the coronation banquet of George III. The house was owned by the immediate Finch family until 1782 when the 4th Earl of Aylesford sold the estate to his brother Captain William Clement Finch, a naval captain who had acquired a fortune by capturing a Spanish ship. Captain Finch wanted to enclose the park so he obtained magistrates' orders in 1784/5 to close and re- route a number of roads through the park. He enclosed the village green, incorporated part of the churchyard into the park grounds and harassed the villagers causing some of them to move away to a nearby hamlet which is now the village of Albury. One of the initial 63 different chimneys In 1800, Captain Finch's widow sold the estate to Samuel Thornton, who made additions to the house, including the north front, to the designs of John Soane. Albury Park was purchased by Charles Wall in 1811, and then by Henry Drummond in 1819. Drummond added a battlemented stone Gothick tower at the north-west corner of the building, and 63 brick chimneys ‚Äì each to a different design. His architect was Augustus Pugin. Drummond also planted many of the rare trees in the park. Post-1890 The Duke of Northumberland obtained Albury Park in 1890 and still owns most of the land, known as the Albury Estate. The mansion contains 64 different mantelpieces, which were in part the work of Robert Adam. The private areas of the park contain a Roman bath and a cave inspired by the Grotto of Posilippo in Naples.Planetware In 1969, the mansion together with of land, mostly laid to grass, was sold. The building was converted into private flats that were owned by the Country Houses Association until it went into liquidation in 2003. The house was then sold to private owners, who continued to let the flats, while living in the house themselves. The parkland and the John Evelyn gardens remain private. Fly fishing is possible at Albury Park as part of the Albury Estate Fisheries fly fishing club. Park membership is based on a syndicate membership.http://alburyestatefisheries.co.uk/albury- park/ There is a public footpath that cuts through the estate. The storms of 1987 and 1990 caused serious damage to parts of the park. Albury Park was featured in a Channel 4 television series, Country House Rescue in December 2008, and November 2009. The house and grounds have also been the location of the filming of the television series Midsomer Murders.

She may no longer play with her best friend, a boy, and must wear a chador when outside the home. Hava is given the choice when to start taking on those responsibilities‚Äînoon that day. A stick pushed into the ground will mark time as the shadow at noon will align with the stick. Ahoo is a married woman who is taking part in a cycling race. Ahead of the rest, Ahoo is pursued by her husband on horseback. He tries to persuade her to stop cycling and come home, and then threatens her with divorce. When Ahoo defiantly continues cycling, her husband brings a mullah who divorces them. Later, tribal superiors and male family members come to stop Ahoo as she tries to escape the social constraints of being a woman. Hoora is an elderly widow who has recently inherited a great deal of money. She decides to buy all of the material possessions she has ever wanted, but could not have while she was married. She ties strings to her fingers to remind her what to buy, and hires several young boys to help her. They take her and her new belongings to the beach. As she floats out to a waiting ship, seemingly free from the bonds of womanhood, she is watched by two of the young women from the bicycle race, and Hava, now wearing her chador.

It was shot on Kish Island in the HormozgƒÅn Province in southern Iran. Makhmalbaf was on the island at the same time, shooting Testing Democracy. Some commentators have suggested that Makhmalbaf was the real director of The Day I Became a Woman (as well as the films of his daughters). Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum has argued against these claims. Meshkini has said that as a female filmmaker, she found making a film in Iran particularly difficult, having to prove her abilities to the cast and crew before being accepted by them. Distribution and reception The Day I Became a Woman premi√®red at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. It went on to play at several festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival, the London Film Festival and the New York New Directors/New Films Festival. It was given a limited release in American theatres on April 6, 2001. On its release in Iran, it was temporarily banned. The film won awards at the Venice Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, the Thessaloniki Film Festival, the Pusan International Film Festival, the Oslo Films from the South Festival and the Chicago International Film Festival. Critical response to the film was generally positive. Film review site Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 87% based on 55 reviews. Metacritic gave it a score of 84% based on 24 reviews. Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called it a \\"stunner of a film\\" and \\"an astonishing directorial debut\\". He said that leaving characters' backgrounds and motives unexplored makes the film enigmatic. Roger Ebert said that the three stories lack \\"the psychological clutter of Western movies\\", describing this fact as a strength. In the Boston Phoenix, Chris Fujiwara said that the film was \\"largely successful, describing the second segment as the highlight, and calling the final story disappointing. In The New Yorker, Michael Sragow called the film \\"fierce, inspired filmmaking\\". Several critics described it as \\"Felliniesque\\".

He had a 1.000 fielding percentage fielding 5 chances without an error.Brian Ostrosser Statistics Baseball-Reference.com Although the Mets won the National League pennant in 1973 he was not on the postseason roster. He is one of the few Canadians to have played for the Mets. In 1974 he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Dwain Anderson, but never played a Major League game for the Indians. Baseball career Ostrosser played Little League baseball in Stoney Creek, Ontario, where his team won the Ontario Little League title, losing the Canadian title to Montreal. He was signed to the Mets by scout Joe Sartorio in 1969. Ostrosser started his professional career in 1970, playing with both the Rookie League Marion Mets and the Class A Pompano Beach Mets that year. He spent the 1971 season with Pompano Beach, and was promoted to the Class AA Memphis Blues of the Texas League in 1972. As Memphis' starting shortstop Ostrosser had a .262 batting average in 470 at bats. He only had 21 extra base hits for a .323 slugging percentage but his 71 walks produced a solid .370 on-base percentage.Ultimate Mets Database ‚Äì Brian Ostrosser He led Texas League shortstops in fielding in 1972, and developed a reputation as an outstanding defensive shortstop. He played for Class AAA Tidewater Tides briefly in 1972 and most of 1973. Although he started the 1973 season with Tidewater, he was not able to play until May due to an emergency operation to remove his appendix during spring training. With Tidewater in 1973 Ostrosser had a batting average of .230 in 283 at-bats. His slugging percentage was just .297 but again a large number of walks (47 in this case) produced a solid on- base percentage of .354. It was during the 1973 that Ostrosser was briefly called up to the New York Mets to replace injured Met shortstop Bud Harrelson. He made his major league debut against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 5, 1973, going 0 for 2, striking out twice. He also played two games against the San Francisco Giants before his final Major League game on August 13, 1973 against the San Diego Padres. He did not get a hit in any of the 5 at-bats he received during his 4-game stint with the Mets. As of 2009, he was one of six Canadians to have played for the Mets, and was the last Canadian to play for the Mets until Jason Bay joined the team in 2009. As of the beginning of 1973, he was one of just four Canadians in the National League, and the only Canadian non-pitcher. In 1974 Ostrosser played again for Tidewater but had a batting average of just .192 in 172 at-bats with no home runs. Even another impressive walk total of 32 relative to his at bats brought his on-base percentage only up to .332. After being traded to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Dwain Anderson on June 21, 1974, Ostrosser played for the Oklahoma City 89ers. There he played 59 games at third base and only 11 games at shortstop, since the 89ers used future Major Leaguer Tom McMillan as their regular shortstop. He batted .261 for the 89ers in 1974 with a slugging percentage of .279 and an on-base percentage of .332. In 1975, still with the 89ers, he played just 63 games, mostly at third base, where he batted just .202 with a slugging percentage of .230 and an on-base percentage of .344, ending his career. Softball career During the early 1980s, Ostrosser represented Canada on the national softball team. In 1980, Ostrosser was on Canada's World's men's softball championship team.

His parents were Australian, and had British ancestry. Early career John Brack was Howard Arkley's first true inspiration and felt encouraged to continue with his art. After seeing an exhibition of works by Sidney Nolan, Arkley became very interested in art. Nolan's use of household materials inspired him and abstract artists such as Klee and Kandinsky also appealed to him. After discovering art, Arkley studied at Prahran College of Advanced Education from 1969 to 1972 where he discovered the airbrush, which he subsequently used in his paintings as he desired smooth surfaces. He had his first exhibition, aged 24, at Tolarno Galleries, Melbourne, in 1975. Most of his early works were abstract, often depicting patterns or lines created with the airbrush. Arkley's works were first black and white, it was only later on that he began experimenting with colour. A turning point in Arkley's career was in 1981 when he created Primitive, a mural, which caught the attention of the public to his potential. In 1982 he painted a tram for the Victorian Ministry of the Arts. One of his first pieces, \\"Le que\\", was noted in the Fine Arts Falls Collection in 1973. Final exhibition  Arkley opened his final exhibition at the 1999 Venice Biennale, then travelled to London to plan an album cover for Nick Cave. Following London, he flew to Los Angeles, where his exhibition at the Karen Lovegrove Gallery was a sell-out.Ashley Crawford, \\"Treasures lost and found\\", The Age, 11 November 2006 They then drove to Las Vegas where he married his partner Alison Burton on 15 July.

The principal contending ethnicities were Croat and Germans. Mainstream musical scholarship today adopts the second of these two hypotheses.  Kuhaƒç's Croatian hypothesis  During the late 19th century, the Croatian ethnologist Franjo Kuhaƒç gathered a great number of Croat folk tunes in fieldwork. Kuhaƒç was struck by the resemblance of a number of these tunes to themes found in Haydn's works, and suggested that Haydn knew these tunes and incorporated them into his work. Other scholars disagreed, suggesting instead that the Haydn original themes had circulated among the people, evolving gradually into more folk-like forms. For details and examples, see Haydn and folk music. Haydn never set foot in Croatia, but he almost certainly lived in the vicinity of Croatian speakers. This is because migration in previous centuries had resulted in a considerable number of Croats dwelling far to the north of Croatia in the Austro-Hungarian border region where Haydn was born and spent most of his life.For further background on the northern Croat diaspora, see Burgenland Croats. This aspect of Kuhaƒç's claim is considered uncontroversial, though the relative fraction of the population that was Croatian-speaking is in dispute. Kuhaƒç went on to claim that the reason Haydn used so many Croatian folk tunes in his music is that he was himself a Croat; that is, a member of the Croat diaspora. As such, he would have been a native speaker of Croatian and a participant in Croatian folk culture. Kuhaƒç also claimed that the name \\"Haydn\\" is of Croatian origin (\\"Hajdin\\"), and likewise for the name of Haydn's mother, Maria Koller. Kuhaƒç wroteKuhaƒç (1880, cited below) in Croatian, which would have been a barrier to scholarly transmission at the time. However, his works were studied by the English-speaking musicologist Henry Hadow, who promulgated them further in his book Haydn: A Croatian Composer (1897) and in the second and third editions (1904‚Äì1910; 1927) of the prestigious Grove Dictionary.  The \\"Haydn as German\\" hypothesis  In the 1930s, the German musicologist Ernst Fritz Schmid took up the issue of Haydn's origins, searching in parish records and elsewhere for evidence of Haydn's ancestry. He concluded on the basis of his research that Haydn's ethnic roots were not Croat, but German, and that the names \\"Haydn\\" and \\"Koller\\" are of German origin.The work was published as Schmidt (1934). Schroeder (2009) describes Schmid's work as entirely convincing; \\"an enormously detailed examination of Haydn's genealogy\\" that \\"put all [alternative] theories to rest.\\" He notes further, however, that the \\"timing of this type of study was unfortunate. Only a few years later similar genealogical studies affirming the German (and Aryan) roots of the Germanic musical giants had become a musicological preoccupation as a propaganda service to the National Socialist government ... Schmid's book pre-dates those sponsored by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and his chief ideologue Alfred Rosenberg, but it is a matter of regret that his proved to be a model for those which followed.\\"  The Haydn-as-German hypothesis and modern scholarship  Despite its acquired associations with National Socialist musicology, Schmid's work has over the long term convinced not just Schroeder, but all mainstream Haydn scholarship. Karl Geiringer endorses Schmid's views, both in his Haydn biography and in the fourth edition of the Grove Dictionary. In the 1982 revision of his biography, Geiringer wrote :\\"Schmid undert[oo]k elaborate genealogical research, tracing the family names back to the Middle Ages and producing most valuable data about Haydn's ancestors. According to his final conclusions, here can be no doubt that the Haydn and Koller families were of German origin.\\"Geiringer 1982, 4 Schmid's views were also endorsed by the French scholar, Michel Brenet, and by Rosemary Hughes in their Haydn biographies. H. C. Robbins Landon devoted the opening pages of his massive work Haydn: Chronicle and Works to a long summary and warm endorsement of Schmid's research. The Danish scholar Jens Peter Larsen, writing in the 1980 New Grove, says of this question: :\\"the matter must be regarded as settled by [Schmid's work]. It may we be said that Schmid 'was even more intent to prove Haydn a German than Kuhaƒç and Hadow had been to prove him a Slav' [quotation from Scott, in the fifth edition of Grove]. But the weight of the documentary evidence that supports his case is decisive.\\"Quotation taken from the 1982 reprinting in book format of Larsen's article; see References below. In the current version of the Grove Dictionary, the Haydn biography (by James Webster) does not even mention the old controversy, other than to cite Schmid's work in the bibliography. Neither Kuhaƒç nor Hadow is cited.The current edition is on line; copyright Oxford University Press, 2007  Haydn's remark on Croats  Curiously, Haydn himself is recorded as having made a somewhat disparaging remark about Croats. His words were remembered by the composer and pianist Friedrich Kalkbrenner, who was Haydn's student in Vienna around the year 1800; he wrote them down in his memoirs, published 1824. In the memoirs, Kalkbrenner refers to himself in the third person. :\\"He received instruction [from Haydn] during the remainder of his stay at Vienna, which was nearly two years. In the first quartet he attempted to write under this great master - the young artist thought he must put forth all his learning as well as all his imagination, and when he produced it, anticipated that he must inevitably receive no usual quantity of praise. The moment Haydn cast his eyes upon it, he exclaimed - hey day! what have we here! Calmuc, Siberian, Cossack, Croat - all the barbarians of the world jumbled together - he laughed heartily, but tempered his severity with some commendation - telling him that there was by far too much fire, but that it was better to have too much than too little and that time and experience would bring his exertions to more favourable issue.\\"Quoted in Robbins Landon and Jones 1988, 306  References  Further reading  * Brenet, Michel (1909) Haydn, Paris. * * Hadow, Henry (1897) Haydn: A Croatian Composer, London. * Hughes, Rosemary (1950) Haydn, New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux. * Kuhaƒç, Franjo (1880) Haydn i hrvatske narodne popievke [Joseph Haydn and National Folk Music].

Early life Samuel C. Williams was born January 15, 1864 near Humboldt, Tennessee. At the urging of family friend Horace Lurton, later a U. S. Supreme Court Justice, Williams pursued law training. He attended Vanderbilt University's School of Law and graduated in June 1884. After a few years of legal practice in Jonesborough, Tennessee Williams moved to Johnson City, Tennessee in 1892. Williams joined politician Walter P. Brownlow in forming Watauga Light and Power Company and the Johnson City Transit Company (Johnson City Streetcar Company). In conjunction with John Cox he established the Banking and Trust Company which later became Unaka National Bank, Tennessee National Bank, and finally Hamilton National Bank. Judge Williams also had interests in Empire Chair Company and the John Sevier Hotel. Government and public service In 1912 he became Chancellor of First Chancery Division of Tennessee. In 1913 he was appointed to complete a vacated seat on the Tennessee Supreme Court. The next year he was elected to the court for a four- year term. He was re-elected in 1918. He left the Tennessee Supreme Court to serve as first dean of the Lamar School of Law (also known as Emory University School of Law) at, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia from 1919 to 1924. He was appointed to codify the laws of Tennessee in 1928 and again in 1938. His eight-volume work, Williams Annotated Code of Tennessee, commonly known as \\"The Williams Code\\", became a model for other state revisions. Historian and writer In 1925 Judge Williams retired to his home, \\"Aquone\\", at Johnson City, Tennessee. The house, named after a Cherokee word for \\"resting place\\" was modeled after a Maryland colonial home Williams had visited. His personal library was fashioned after the design of Sir Walter Scott's study at Abbotsford House. The home is named on both the Tennessee Historical Register and the National Register of Historic Places. In his later years he devoted much of his time to writing. His history texts and articles carried his personal, if wordy, enthusiastic style which helped to popularize local history studies. Tennessee Governor Prentice Cooper appointed him to head the rejuvenated Tennessee Historical Commission in 1941. In that position he founded publications and arranged the 1944 purchase of a Johnson City farm which became the Tipton-Haynes Historic Site. During these years Williams founded the East Tennessee Historical Society and was also in part responsible for providing the land and financing of the public library in Johnson City named in memory of his son, Mayne Williams. During his final years he helped prepare for the Tennessee Sesquicentennial in 1946 and was a member of the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Civil Procedure in the Federal Courts. Judge Williams was an avid scholar and collector of Tennessee history and gave many items to libraries and museums. His papers are found in the East Tennessee State University Archives of Appalachia, the University of Tennessee's Frank H. McClung Museum and in the Archives of Emory University. He died December 14, 1947. Works * History of the Lost State of Franklin (1924) * Lieut.

It was published in April 1960 as a Popular Library (paperback) Edition. The cover painting is by Harry Schaare.  Plot introduction  Joe Tanner doesn't realize it, but the floating craps game he unwinds with after a hard day's work is rigged against him. His blonde bombshell wife, Shelly, sees through the con but can't get Joe to take her seriously. In Las Vegas, she enlists the aid of casino detective Barney Conroy. Soon the pair find themselves between the police, who suspect them of the murder of Joe Tanner, and the real murderers, a mysterious gang that is determined to get rid of Shelly and Barney, too.  Plot summary  Shelly Tanner's husband Joe is a wealthy industrialist conducting military-sponsored research on Cold War armaments and intelligence gear. To relax, Joe has taken to shooting craps in a high-stakes floating game situated in various Los Angeles locations. He consistently loses serious sums of money, but out of obsession with the idea that his luck has to change, he returns to the game night after night. His beautiful, sexually frustrated wife Shelly sees through the crooked game, but can't convince Joe to stop throwing his money away. In desperation she drives to Las Vegas to enlist the aid of casino detective Barney Conroy. At first, Barney wants nothing to do with free-lance work. He prefers the predictable security of his casino job. But when he is roughed up in the casino parking lot by thugs obviously tied to the Tanner affair, his injured pride compels him to find Shelly and promise his assistance. Shelly brings Barney and Joe together in Los Angeles and they all visit the craps game. Barney quietly confirms that the game is rigged. He thinks he recognizes the stickman as a dishonest but cowardly neighbor from his boyhood home in Kansas City, but doesn't know if he himself has been recognized. After discussing the crooked nature of the game with a still-unreceptive Joe, Barney and Shelly form an amorous association. Shelly decides to leave Joe. As she and Barney spend a blissful first night together in a nearby motel, Joe returns to the craps game and uses the information Barney uncovered to confront the gang running it. Their response is to overpower him, take him to his own home and kill him using Shelly's gun. The gang's operatives have followed Barney and Shelly to the motel, know what they're up to, and anonymously tip the police that the pair are Joe's murderers. Barney and Shelly are arrested and both spend some time in jail, but because no evidence directly implicates him, Barney is released. He uses his freedom to discover the real motives and the subrosa political affiliations of the gang members and, with the help of Shelly's high-priced Hollywood lawyer, successfully leads the FBI into a night-time, seaside gun battle where the gang is defeated.

Life Fairfax was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Fairfax of Denton, Yorkshire and Dorothy Gale, and was born at Bilbrough, near York. As a young man he saw military service in the Low Countries, where he commanded a company of foot under Sir Francis Vere. Before and after the death of Mary, Queen of Scots, he was employed by Elizabeth on several diplomatic communications with James VI of Scotland. James offered him a title, which he declined. In 1586 he offered his services to James to suppress a rebellion under Lord Maxwell; and on the death of Elizabeth he was, with six of his nearest kindred, one of the first Englishmen who went to Scotland to swear fealty to the new king. He had served in France under Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex and was knighted by him in Rouen in 1591. He also sat as a member of parliament for Lincoln in 1586, for Aldborough in 1588 and for Yorkshire in 1601 and 1625. After the accession of James I to the throne, he settled down on his estate at Denton Hall near Ilkley. He bred horses, and wrote about horsemanship. On the accession of Charles I, Fairfax was again knight of the shire (MP) for Yorkshire in the parliament of 1625. He drew up a statement of his services, and on 4 May 1627 was created Lord Fairfax of Cameron in the Peerage of Scotland; the grant was facilitated by a payment of ¬£1,500. Fairfax died 1 May 1640. He was buried, by the side of his wife, who had died in 1620, in the south transept of All Saints' Church, Otley, where a large altar-tomb, surmounted with their effigies, still commemorates their virtues. The legend was written by Edward Fairfax the poet, his half-brother. Works Fairfax is said in Analecta Fairfaxiana to have written a number of works: a discourse, containing 150 pages, entitled 'Dangers Diverted, or the Highway to Heidelbergh'; 'Conjectures about Horsemanship'; 'The Malitia of Yorkshire'; a tract on the Yorkshire cavalry and against horse racing; 'The Malitia of Durham'; 'Orders for the House,' &c.; The last of these, The Order for the Government of the House of Denton, lays down in great detail the duties of every servant in his household. Family In 1582 he married Ellen, daughter of Robert Aske of Aughton, Yorkshire. As a member of the council of the north he was brought into connection with Edmund Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave, its president. His eldest son Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron, married Sheffield's daughter, Mary, in 1607. In 1620 Fairfax's younger sons, William and John, were with the English army in the Low Countries. A letter from William states that his 'white-haired father' had come over to join them, bought horses and arms, and been received with the respect due to his former services. In 1631 he heard from their general that both his sons had been killed at the siege of Frankenthal. Two other sons are stated by Thoresby to have died a violent death in the same year: Peregrine at La Rochelle and Thomas in Turkey. Henry Fairfax (fourth son) and Charles Fairfax were other sons. Fairfax had two daughters: Dorothy, married to Sir William Constable, and Anne, wife of Sir George Wentworth of Woolley.

Casi√±o (, born 15 November 1968), popularly known as Teddy Casi√±o, is a writer and journalist. He was a member of the House of Representatives for Bayan Muna. Early life and career Born to middle class parents, Casi√±o finished elementary education at the De La Salle University (DLSU) in 1982. He continued his high school studies at La Salle Green Hills, where his stint as a volunteer for the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL) in the 1986 snap elections swept him into the politics of People Power via the EDSA Revolution. The EDSA experience, plus the stories about hunger in Negros, moved him to forego a DLSU scholarship to study agriculture in UP Los Ba√±os, where he became an activist in his freshman year. He became editor in chief of the student paper, The UPLB Perspective, from 1989‚Äì1991 even as he consistently made it to the honor roll. In 1991, Casi√±o was elected national president of the College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP), an alliance of over 700 student publications nationwide. He chose to delay his thesis requirement to work full-time for the CEGP. He eventually graduated from UPLB with the degree of BA Sociology in 1993, with his thesis bringing him to faraway Pamplona town in Cagayan Valley, where he studied the impact of Church activism on rural communities. =Activism= Wikimedia Philippines and Open Street Map Philippines during a Software Freedom Day event in 2011 at University of Santo Tomas. After his stint in the student movement, Teddy joined the Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU - May First Movement). His childhood ambition and his father's wishes for him to become a lawyer gave way to his activism. In 1996, he entered the UP College of Law only to leave it three days later when it interfered with his work in the KMU. After four years in the KMU, he joined the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN), the largest alliance of progressive people's organizations in the country. He was elected secretary general in 1999 and was catapulted to national prominence in 2001 as one of the youngest leaders of EDSA 2. Casino was appointed commissioner of the EDSA People Power Commission but was removed for constantly being critical of the current administration. He had a short stint in ABS-CBN's Hoy Gising and The Correspondents. In 2002, he was accorded the UPLB Distinguished Alumni Award for Extension. As a writer, Casino was a regular contributor to the Philippine Daily Inquirer's Youngblood column from 1994-1996. In 1995, he became a regular columnist for Business World, one of the most respected business newspapers in the country. He also wrote columns for the tabloids People's Bagong Taliba and Frontpage, the OFW weekly Pinoy Gazette and the online magazine Bulatlat.com. Legislative career In the May 2004 elections, Casino was elected as Bayan Muna's representative in Congress. With the re-election of Bayan Muna in the 2007 partylist polls, he returned to Congress. ''' = 15th Congress = ''' In the 15th Congress, Casino became the chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship Development, where he champions the welfare of our micro, small and medium enterprises. As chairperson of the Committee, Casino also spearheads Buy Pinoy, Build Pinoy! - a grassroots campaign promoting the consumption of Filipino-made products and the development of integrated, world-class Filipino industries. He is also senior vice chairperson of the Committee on Higher and Technical Education, safeguarding the youth's right to affordable and quality education. '''  Authored Laws and Bills  ''' Laws Casino is the one of the principal authors of four laws that have benefited the poor and marginalized sectors, namely: # The Public Attorneys Act of 2007 (R.A. 9406) which strengthened the Public Attorneys Office and expanded its free legal services to poor litigants;R.A. 9406 Public Attorneys Act of 2007 (H.B. 5921) # The Tax Relief Act of 2009 (R.A. 9504) which exempts minimum wage earners from withholding taxes;R.A. 9504 Tax Relief Act of 2009 (H.B. 3971) # The Rent Control Act of 2009 (R.A. 9653) which put a cap on rent for low-income earners;R.A. 9653 Rent Control Act of 2009 (H.B. 6098) # The Anti- Torture Act of 2009 (R.A. 9745) which penalizes torture.R.A. 9745 Anti-Torture Act of 2009 (H.B. 5709) Aside from this, he has authored a total of 178 authored and 376 co-authored measures, making him the 4th most prolific congressman in the 15th Congress. Bills Casino's main advocacy is the lowering of prices of electricity, oil and water as well as regulation of the cost of education, healthcare, mobile communications, toll fees and other basic utilities and services.

It is famous for \\"shedding light\\" on bands such as the Obsessed, Trouble, Overkill, Metal Church, Metallica, Slayer, Virgin Steele, Hellhammer, Voivod, Armored Saint, Lizzy Borden, Possessed and more. History In 1981, Brian Slagel, founder of Metal Blade Records, decided to put out a compilation of unsigned, underground metal bands. Throughout the '80s and early '90s he continued to release more volumes of the compilations. Metal Massacre XII was released in 1995 and was the final Metal Massacre album until Metal Massacre XIII, released 11 years later in 2006. Metal Massacre XIII differed from the previous releases which featured primarily unsigned bands, containing mostly established bands on the Metal Blade roster.

Black 'n Blue's \\"Chains Around Heaven\\" replaced Steeler's \\"Cold Day in Hell\\", which was the first track on the original version of the compilation. Version 2 of Metallica's \\"Hit the Lights\\" is a new recording as James Hetfield was unhappy with the original version. The second pressing features Dave Mustaine alone on lead guitar instead of Lloyd Grant as lead guitar (first solo) and Dave Mustaine (second solo)-that was version 1. Also version 1 had reportedly James Hetfield on bass and rhythm guitar, while Ron McGovney was not actually playing on version 1 while credited . Version 2 with Dave Mustaine alone on lead guitar (and Ron McGovney on bass) is the same as that included in No Life Til Leather demo (july 1982).

History The Ural was developed at the Electronic Computer Producing Manufacturer of Penza in the Soviet Union and was produced between 1956 and 1964. The computer was widely used in the 1960s, mainly in the socialist countries, though some were also exported to Western Europe and Latin America. The Indian Statistical Institute purchased an Ural-1 in 1958. When the University of Tartu received a new computer, its old computer, the Ural 1, was moved to a science-based secondary school, the N√µo Reaalg√ºmnaasium. That eventhttp://nrg.tartu.ee/koolist/ajalugu took place in 1965 and made the N√µo Reaalg√ºmnaasium one of the first secondary schools in the Soviet Union to own a computer. The name of the computer was also used to coin the first name for \\"computer\\" in Estonian, raal, in use until the 1990s until it was replaced by the word arvuti (\\"computer\\"). School 444 in Moscow, Russia has started graduating programmers in 1960 and had the Ural computer operating by its students on-premises in 1965. Attributes Models Ural-1 to Ural-4 were based on vacuum tubes (valves), with the hardware being able to perform 12,000 floating-point calculations per second. One word consisted of 40 bits and was able to contain either one numeric value or two instructions. Ferrite core was used as operative memory beginning with the Ural-2. A new series (Ural-11, Ural-14, produced between 1965 and 1971) was based on semiconductors. It was able to perform mathematical tasks at computer centres, industrial facilities and research facilities. The device occupied approximately 90-100 square metres of space. The computer ran on three-phase electric power and had a three-phase magnetic voltage stabiliser with 30kVA capacity. The main units of the system were: keyboard, controlling-reading unit, input punched tape, output punched tape, printer, magnetic tape memory, ferrite memory, ALU (arithmetical logical unit), CPU (central processing unit), and power supply.

He played college football at the University of Arizona from 1970 through 1972 and in the National Football League (NFL) for the Minnesota Vikings, Baltimore Colts, and Los Angeles Rams from 1974 through 1979, taking part in two Super Bowls with the Vikings and Rams. Since the end of his NFL career, Wallace has periodically struggled with substance abuse and experienced bouts of homelessness. In 2014, he joined a class-action concussion lawsuit against the NFL. As of February 2018, his whereabouts were unknown. Early life Wallace was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he lived in the St. Bernard Projects. Career Wallace attended St. Augustine High School in New Orleans. He enrolled at the University of Arizona and played college football for the Arizona Wildcats from 1970 through 1972. United Press International and Sporting News named him a first-team All- America in 1972, while the Associated Press named him a third-team All- American. He was named to the All-Western Athletic Conference (WAC) team in his junior and senior years. Wallace had 20 interceptions with the Wildcats, the second-most in school history, with 19 of those coming in his junior and senior years. His 11 interceptions in 1971 is a WAC record. The Minnesota Vikings selected Wallace in the second round, with the 34th overall pick, in the 1973 NFL draft. Wallace played six professional seasons as a cornerback from 1974 through 1979. He spent his rookie season on the Vikings' practice squad, including Super Bowl VIII. He became a starter for the Vikings the next year, and started in Super Bowl IX. Wallace played for the Baltimore Colts in 1975 and the Los Angeles Rams from 1976 through 1979. His 52 punt returns and 618 punt return yards led the NFL in 1978. His final game in the NFL was Super Bowl XIV as a member of the Rams. After the game, he berated his coach in the Rose Bowl locker room for not using him in the game, saying the coach could \\"kiss his ass\\". That offseason, he was disinvited from the Super Bowl ring party and cut from the team. He retired with 11 career interceptions in 70 games played. Post-football life Out of the NFL, Wallace worked on an oil platform. The year after his football career ended, his mother died and he began to abuse alcohol and use crack cocaine. He has battled addictions to numerous drugs, including crack, alcohol, and heroin, throughout his life, and has disappeared for years at a time. Ted Jackson, a photojournalist for The Times-Picayune, discovered him homeless on the streets of New Orleans in 1990, and published a photo he took of the former player, which inspired Wallace to make an attempt at recovery; at the time, his whereabouts had been unknown for roughly a decade. He became sober, got married, and bought a house in the northeastern suburbs of Baltimore. His sobriety lasted until 2002, when a domestic dispute with his wife led to him fleeing back to the streets of New Orleans. After several years of drug use, he was jailed in 2008 for check fraud, serving half of a seven-year sentence. He was released early for good behavior. On June 5, 2012, the WDSU television channel in New Orleans ran an article about the New Orleans Mission (a homeless shelter) closing its doors due to financial problems. In the article, Wallace stated that he was homeless and had been frequenting the shelter for two months. Wallace achieved sobriety again in 2014 and joined Narcotics Anonymous; the same year, Wallace took part in a lawsuit against the NFL regarding concussions. In July 2017, Wallace disappeared again, having relapsed and returned to the streets. Since then, his exact whereabouts are unknown. In September of 2020, Photojournalist Ted Jackson and Wallace released an autobiography about his life in the book ‚ÄúYou Ought To Do A Story About Me.‚Äù The two were interviewed by Access Hollywood detailing on how they crossed paths, ended up becoming friends and eventually ended up collaborating on the book.

It has a slow flight and spends a lot of time sitting still in the foliage of large fruiting trees, often in riverine forest on the plains. It is mainly brown above and chestnut below with the a sheen of green or amethyst. Males have a whitish grey cap while females have a brownish grey cap and less gloss on the feathers. They are frugivores, foraging in small groups in the canopy of trees but sometimes descending to the ground for seeds and fallen fruit.  Description  This large 36‚Äì40.5 cm-long pigeon is all-dark chestnut brown with a contrasting pale crown. The male has whitish-grey crown, purplish-maroon upperparts with faint green gloss on the neck; more strongly iridescent mantle and back; dark slate-coloured rump and uppertail-coverts; vinous-brown ear-coverts, throat and underparts[ slaty-grey undertail-coverts; and blackish tail and flight feathers. Females have a more brownish-grey crown. Juveniles initially have the crown colour matching the mantle, duller wing-coverts and scapulars with rufous fringes, a much reduced gloss on the upperparts and greyer underparts. The legs are crimson and iris is creamy-yellow in adults. The skin around the eyes and the ceres are magenta. Some taxonomists have grouped it along with Columba argentina which are both Old World pigeons that lack patterns on the back of the neck.  Distribution and habitat  The pale-capped pigeon is very locally distributed across its broad range, which encompasses parts of northern and northeastern India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. The type specimen was collected in Chaibasa, Singhbhum, India but relatively few records exist from Peninsular India. Records of the species exist from Maharahtra, Orissa, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh (Araku valley). Observers considered it a seasonal visitor in Sri Lanka. In some parts of Thailand, they are winter visitors and birds have been seen roosting in mangroves far from the mainland. They are found mainly on the forests of the plains. It frequents a wide variety of habitats from the lowlands up to 1,600 m, chiefly primary or secondary evergreen forest, but also open, deciduous dipterocarp forest, bamboo, and agricultural fields, particularly in close proximity to forest. Mangroves, small forested islands and other coastal habitats are probably only frequented in the non-breeding season. It is mainly frugivorous, although seeds and grain form important dietary components in some areas. Tickell noted that the birds were found in groups of 4 to 5, mainly on Eugenia trees near rivers. They ate the berries of these trees, foraging in the morning and evenings and resting during the heat of the day. Layard noted that they favoured Cinnamon trees. It does not appear to have been common in most of its range. It was said to be common on the island of Koh Mur or Pulau Muntia in western Thailand. Recent records indicate that it now only occurs rarely and erratically within its range.  Behaviour and ecology  These pigeons fly about in small groups, foraging mainly in the morning and evening. They are said to have a low call similar to that of Ducula aenea but shorter and less prolonged. The breeding season is May to August and the flimsy platform nest is placed low down in a tree and one or rarely two eggs are laid. A species of helminth parasite, Cotugnia joyeuxi Baer, was first collected from this species from a Burmese specimen.

For example, in East Africa, a distinctive group of animal species, mostly pigs, is characteristic of the fossils preserved from a particular period of time. This faunal assemblage has been used effectively to chronologically correlate the East African early hominid sites. Faunal assemblages are useful in determining the foraging patterns of hominids. One such assemblage at Lang Rongrien in Thailand indicated a hunter-gatherer group which was highly flexible when it came to finding food. They relied heavily on turtle and tortoise to supply the meat portion of their diet when hunting large game was unpredictable. This assemblage also suggested the paleoenvironment was drier and cooler than today because of a distinct lack of pig bones. Mudar K and Anderson D 2007.

He later became the organization‚Äôs Regional Director in Southern Mindanao from 1987 to 1995. In 1995, after 8 years serving the TFDP, Virador was appointed secretary-general of KARAPATAN. After 5 years in KARAPATAN, Virador joined Bayan Muna in 2000 becoming the party‚Äôs spokesperson in Southern Mindanao. Virador, in 2002, was charged with rebellion by linking his name to the alias of a New People's Army commander. The case was later dismissed. He was charged again by police in 2005 with direct assault after he led a labor strike in Sampaloc, Manila on October 21, 2005.  Political career  Virador was nominated as Bayan Muna's 4th nominee for the 2001 Philippine House of Representatives elections. On November 7, 2003, following the resignation of Crispin Beltran, Virador assumed the vacated party-list seat. While in Congress, Virador stood up to deliver privilege speeches questioning the legality of joint RP-US Balikatan military exercises in Mindanao, the violation of human rights of the civilian populace during military operations, and the problems of landlessness and displacement of peasant tillers and rural workers.

Grave of Mieczys≈Çaw Lubelski in Brookwood Cemetery In 1906/07 he entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, where he was a pupil of Xawery Dunikowski, and later studied in Berlin. After 1929 he returned to Warsaw. He was very active in the inter-war years and had many exhibitions, including at Warsaw‚Äôs Zacheta in 1920. During the German occupation of Poland he joined the Armia Krajowa ‚Äì Home Army resistance - and took part in the Warsaw Uprising, following which he was incarcerated in a Nazi German concentration camp. After the war he settled and worked in England. He created many sculptures for public buildings and churches, perhaps his best known being the Polish War Memorial at Northolt Aerodrome, west London, unveiled in 1948. One of his funerary monuments is a Christ praying in Gethsemani, ceramic in a concrete chapel on the grave of Dr. Antoni Kutek at Brompton Cemetery, London. His works in Warsaw included: stone knight's armorials and lions decorating the Ministry of Army Affairs (Defence) near Nowowiejska St., bas-reliefs in the buildings of the National Theatre, the Ministry of Justice and the PKO Bank near Sienkiewicza St. (all 1924); a bas- relief over the portal of the State Institute of Hygiene and decorative folk sculptures at the Raczy≈Ñski Palace (both 1925); the Sappers' Monument (1932). Almost all of his works were destroyed during the Second World War. The well- loved Kosciuszko Monument in Liberty Square, central Lodz (1930) which the Germans destroyed in 1939 was re-created by the artist in 1960. The monument Lubelski designed for the grave of L.L.

Retrieved June 6, 2020 February 11, 1953 ‚Äì July 8, 2014) was an American baseball shortstop. He played 12 years in Major League Baseball, appearing in 979 games for the Detroit Tigers (1973-1977), Cleveland Indians (1978-1981), New York Mets (1982), and Chicago Cubs (1983-1984). He ranked third in the American League in 1977 with a range factor of 5.16 per nine innings at shortstop. His career range factor of 4.841 per nine innings at shortstop ranks as the 25th best in Major League history. Early years Veryzer was born in Port Jefferson, New York, in 1953. He attended Islip High School in Islip, New York. In high school, he played shortstop for Islip's baseball team and compiled a .467 batting average. He also played soccer and basketball at Islip where his father was the athletic director and basketball coach. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Veryzer was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the first round (eleventh pick overall) of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed a bonus contract with the Tigers in June 1971. His older brother, James, had been drafted by the Kansas City Athletics in the 49th round of the 1967 Major League Baseball Draft, but had also moved to the Tigers' organization by 1971 as well. Veryzer played for the Bristol Tigers upon graduating from high school in 1971. He batted just .225 with four home runs and 20 RBIs, but his defensive play earned him Appalachian League MVP honors. He was promoted to the Montgomery Rebels in the Southern League in 1972 where he hit .220. During spring training in 1973, Veryzer received acclaim for his potential. A Detroit scout predicted that Veryzer would be the greatest shortstop since Honus Wagner. A Chicago scout predicted he would be one of the five greatest shortstops of all time. Detroit manager Billy Martin called Veryzer \\"the best looking young shortstop I've ever seen.\\" Despite the acclaim, Veryzer began the 1973 season with the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League where he raised his batting average to .250. =Detroit Tigers= In August 1973, Veryzer was called up by the Tigers. At age 20, he was the sixth youngest player in the American League when he was called up. With Ed Brinkman at shortstop, Veryzer saw little playing time in 1973; he batted .300 (six for 20) and had an RBI single off the Minnesota Twins' Dave Goltz in his first major league at-bat. Veryzer returned to the minor leagues in 1974 season, batting .296 in 223 at bats with the Evansville Triplets. In August, 1974, he was again called up by the Tigers when the team dealt Jim Northrup to the Montreal Expos. On September 20, 1974, he hit a two run home run in the second inning to give the Tigers a 2-1 lead. After the Tigers surrendered the lead, he hit an RBI single in the seventh to tie the game back up. In all, he went three-for-four with a home run, two walks and four runs batted in. The Tigers traded Brinkman in November 1974, and Veryzer became the Tigers' starting shortstop in 1975, appearing in 128 games at the position. On June 8, 1975, he doubled with two out in the ninth inning to break-up a no-hitter by Ken Holtzman. For the season, he batted .252 with five home runs and 48 RBIs (both career highs) while also hitting thirteen doubles to be named the shortstop on the Topps Rookie All-Star team. However, his 24 errors at short were fourth highest in the league. Injuries limited Veryzer to 97 games in 1976. He returned healthy in , but a horrible month of May (.093 batting average, five RBIs and two errors on the field) caused him to lose playing time to Mark Wagner and Chuck Scrivener. The three combined to bat .174 with three home runs and 33 RBIs while committing 26 errors. In December 1977, Veryzer was dealt to the Cleveland Indians for outfielder Charlie Spikes, opening the door for Alan Trammell to assume the starting shortstop job in Detroit for the next 16 years. =Cleveland Indians= Larvell Blanks won the starting shortstop job out of spring training , but inconsistent fielding led to his being replaced by Veryzer at the start of May. With Duane Kuiper at second and Buddy Bell at third, the Indians boasted one of the better fielding infields in the American League, however, light hitting relegated them to a sixth-place finish in the American League East. For his part, Veryzer batted .271 with one home run and 32 RBIs. His most memorable moment of the season may have come on September 13 when he drove in the winning run of the Indians' 2-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox with a successful suicide squeeze bunt, knocking the Red Sox out of first place. His offensive numbers slumped to .220 with no home runs and 34 RBIs, but he had his finest season with the glove in . Veryzer figured in ninety double plays while logging a career high .974 fielding percentage in a career high 702 chances. Tendinitis caused Veryzer to miss two weeks at the start of June, and a month of play in the second half of the season. He was at his best when healthy, however, batting .271 and putting up a .971 fielding percentage. Likewise, injuries caused Veryzer to miss two weeks toward the end of the season. On May 15, 1981, Veryzer made a brilliant play on an Alfredo Griffin ground ball up the middle to record the first out of the day's match- up with the Toronto Blue Jays. From there, Indians pitcher Len Barker retired the next 26 batters he faced for the first perfect game in the majors since . =New York Mets= In January 1982, Veryzer was traded to the New York Mets for pitcher Ray Searage. Veryzer competed with Ron Gardenhire for the starting shortstop role with Gardenhire winning the spot. Veryzer appeared in only 16 games at shortstop for the Mets, though he also filled in for 26 games at second base. He was batting .333 on June 1 when Claudell Washington ran into him trying to break up a double play. Veryzer sustained a clean break in the left fibula, ending his season. =Chicago Cubs= In April 1983, Veryzer was traded to the Chicago Cubs for two minor league pitchers. With Larry Bowa at short and Ryne Sandberg beginning his Hall of Fame career at second, Veryzer saw very little playing time with the Cubs. In two seasons with the Cubs, he made just 175 plate appearances, batting .198. However, playing with the Cubs allowed him to reach the post-season for the only time in his career in his final season. He appeared in three of the five games of the 1984 National League Championship Series as a late inning defensive replacement, logging his only career post-season at-bat in game four. He popped out to Garry Templeton in foul territory. He was cut by the Cubs during spring training in 1985. Veryzer played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball, compiling a career batting average of .241, 687 hits, 231 RBIs, and 14 home runs. Later years and family Veryzer and his wife, Vivian, had three children, Tom Jr., Billy, and Jennie. He was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in 1985. He died in July 2014 after suffering a stroke.

The settlement had a long continuous occupation running from the Middle Formative Period through the Postclassic. The Late Formative saw the construction of a number of triadic architectural groups linked with roads running north to south. Some of the larger pyramids were remodeled during the Early Classic, and held royal tombs. In the Late Classic (ca. 600‚Äì800), the city-state of Coba conquered Yaxuna and built a 100 km Sacbe, or raised road, to connect the two cities. This was the longest the Maya ever built. Internally, new roads running east to west were constructed. In the Terminal Classic (800‚Äì1100), the state of Chich√©n Itz√° to the north began a war with the Coba state, and Yaxuna constructed a city wall, but Chich√©n Itz√° appears to have conquered the city by around 950. Sacked and ritually destroyed, the city never recovered. By the Postclassic (1100‚Äì1697), the population was much reduced, with new construction limited to minor additions to older architecture.

She is also the daughter of actor Macdonald Carey. Biography Born in Los Angeles, California, Carey first began her career as a teen model and actress appearing in the 1966 cult film Lord Love a Duck as well as several guest slots on the T.V. shows Lassie, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Run for Your Life, The Donna Reed Show and The Wild Wild West. In the late 1960s, she joined and recorded with the band C.K. Strong for their 1969 self-titled release. The band later opened for Procol Harum in concert. She subsequently recorded with Neil Merryweather on the 1970 joint project album Ivar Avenue Reunion which also featured musicians Barry Goldberg and Charlie Musselwhite. Also in 1970, she provided the vocals for the singing of fictional character Kelly McNamara (\\"Dolly Read\\") in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. In addition to singing, Carey also co-wrote two songs for the soundtrack with composer Stu Phillips. For legal reasons, however, Lynn Carey's vocals are not on the 1970 soundtrack LP, but Ami Rushes', which disappointed fans with the original film versions. The labels did not become available until 2003/2004, Harkit Records and Soundtrack Classics, the vocal recordings with Lynn Carey and Barbara \\"Sandi\\" Robison, released on CD and LP as bonus tracks. The song \\"Once I Had Love\\" is missing on the CD, but is included on the LP. \\"Once I Had Love\\" was released on a CD by another label, but for this they again used LP recording with Ami Rushes (see Discography). In 1971, the album Vacuum Cleaner resulted, co-credited to 'Merryweather & Carey'. In December 1972, Carey was Penthouse magazine's Pet of the Month. Earlier that same year, she and Merryweather formed the group 'Mama Lion' and released the albums Preserve Wildlife and its 1973 follow-up Give It Everything I've Got. Lynn and the band are seen performing in another Russ Meyer film, The Seven Minutes. Extensive tours of Europe and North America followed, including appearances at The Montreux Jazz Festival and performances on German television. In 1984, her debut solo release Good Times! (which she produced along with co-producer Ollie Mitchell) showcased her jazz and big band leanings. A remastered CD reissue of the album was released in 2000. During the early 1980s, Carey also performed with the L.A. Jazz Choir and appeared on the group's second Grammy- nominated album, From All Sides, released in 1985. During the 1990s and in the early 2000s, she performed in Russia on several occasions. In 2001, the archival CD release Lynn Carey - Mama Lion... Roars Back! was issued featuring the early Mama Lion \\"demos\\" which secured the group their initial record deal as well as unreleased 1980-1990s solo material. Her studio session credits range from backing vocals for Charlie Musselwhite (1975) to Eric Burdon (1980s era), Michel Berger and providing music for various television and film scores in the 1980s. Carey credits her father with introducing her to the world of jazz music and foreign film.  Discography  ;C.K. Strong * C.K.

Since 1999, the villagers have been a welcome host for painted storks and grey herons, which annually breed on the trees inside the village and raise their young ones. Kaggaladu is located about 9 km to the north-west of Sira, a town on the Sira-Chengavara Main Road and the heronry was first made known to the outside world in 1999 by members of the Tumkur- based NGO Wildlife Aware Nature Club.IndiaBirds.com - HotSpots History of the Park According to locals, the grey herons have been nesting here on a single tamarind tree since 1993. Their numbers increased in 1996, when a lone tree in the neighbouring Muddakanahalli, on which these birds were nesting, was disturbed by poachers and some birds were killed. The villagers are so interested in conserving the birds that, they do not harvest the tamarind in the trees owned by them as well that of the Government. While many of the villagers are interested in protecting the birds just because they look beautiful, a few believe them as harbingers of prosperity, hence their protection. Natural History of the heronry =Fauna= As the area lies in the plains of the Deccan Plateau, bordering Andhra Pradesh, the wildlife found here is related to the drier areas. WANC is compiling a detailed report of the flora and fauna found in the area. But notably a few herds of blackbuck roam around Kaggaladu and surrounding villages. Also some of the villagers claim to have sighted the great Indian bustard in the area, but this has not yet been confirmed. Bird Sanctuary The birds usually stay in Kaggaladu Bird Sanctuary for about six months, starting from the month of February.Kaggaladu - Lost in wilderness; Deccan Herald Report The birds start arriving in groups for the nestling season. By the end of August, the migratory birds depart. Kaggaladu is said to be the second largest painted storks sanctuary in South India, after Kokrebellur sanctuary in Mandya district, Karnataka. It has been observed that, many birds of the foreign origin also migrate to Kaggaladu during the nestling season. In this bird sanctuary, one can find the birds in flocks of hundreds, but the big gathering of birds is not of the same feather. The tamarind trees have been maintained exclusively for birds shelter and nestling. It has been reported that, the villagers of Kaggaladu are very much attached to these migrating birds.

August 2004, La distinguida genealog√≠a de los San Mart√≠n was a lieutenant of dragoons in Yoro and an official in the governments of Tegucigalpa and Nacaome. In 1819 he moved permanently to El Salvador, with his wife Joaquina Fug√≥n. He was elected deputy from Tejutla and Chalatenango, where he held extensive rural properties, in 1824. He joined the Salvadoran army, and was promoted to colonel. He was magistrate of the Court of Justice from December 24, 1824 to March 1, 1830. By vote of the towns he was elected vice-chief of state under Mariano Prado in 1832, and from May 13, 1832 to July 25, 1834 he exercised the functions of chief of state. He left office on the latter date when Prado returned to power. Prado served until July 1, 1833, when San Mart√≠n again became president. His second term continued until June 23, 1834. During his administration, he suppressed the Nonualco Indigenous revolt led by Anastasio Aquino. He also dealt with several military revolts. With the aid of Captain Ram√≥n Belloso and his company, San Mart√≠n also suppressed the hordes of thieves dominating the country, many of whom had tried to join with Aquino to contest governmental authority. On February 13, 1833, San Mart√≠n decreed an amnesty for the rebel Nonualco Indians. In March 1833, General Francisco Moraz√°n joined with rebel forces against San Mart√≠n. On April 6, 1833 San Mart√≠n and Moraz√°n signed an agreement reconciling their differences. On July 1, 1833 the Congress of the state reorganized the Salvadoran government, making San Mart√≠n chief of state for a second time, and Lorenzo Gonz√°lez vice chief of state. This election was annulled by the federal Congress. Nevertheless, his second term continued until June 23, 1834. On that date, General Carlos Salazar, imposed by Moraz√°n, took over the government. Gonz√°lez was assassinated in his hacienda La Asunci√≥n in May 1834. San Mart√≠n was condemned to two years of exile and the confiscation of his property. On his return to the country he was deputy to the constituent congress of the state, from 1840 to 1841, and afterwards vice president. Colonel San Mart√≠n distinguished himself as a defender of the law during the tragic days of September 1841, when General Francisco Malesp√≠n staged a coup d'√©tat and overthrew the legal president, Antonio Jos√© Ca√±as. San Mart√≠n died in 1854 at the age of 84 at his hacienda Amayo. His son Jos√© Mar√≠a San Mart√≠n was president of independent El Salvador in 1852 and again in 1854-56.

Biography He was born in Wechold, near Hoya, and his father, also called Philipp Spitta, was a theologian and wrote the Protestant collection of hymns entitled Psalter und Harfe. As a child, the younger Spitta learnt the piano, organ, and composition. He studied theology and classical philology at the University of G√∂ttingen from 1860, graduating in 1864 with a Ph.D. for a dissertation on Tacitus (Der Satzbau bei Tacitus, 1866). While at university, he composed, wrote a biography of Robert Schumann, and became friends with Johannes Brahms. He became a teacher of Greek and Latin in, successively, Reval, Sondershausen, and Leipzig, while pursuing his interest in and lecturing on music history in general and Johann Sebastian Bach in particular. His Bach study began to be published in 1873, and was followed by an appointment as professor of music history at the University of Berlin in 1875, and a further appointment as administrative director of the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik, at which posts he remained for the rest of his life. The students he taught include Oskar Fleischer, Max Friedlaender, Carl Krebs, Max Seiffert, Emil Vogel, Peter Wagner, and Johannes Wolf. He founded one of the first scholarly music periodicals, the Vierteljahrsschrift f√ºr Musikwissenschaft, with Friedrich Chrysander and Guido Adler in 1885, and also had an important role in the publication of the Denkm√§ler deutscher Tonkunst. Work A commemorative plaque in Berlin He left a strong influence on the new fields of historical criticism and musicology; his work spanned periods of music history from the early Middle Ages to his own time, and embraced research, teaching, writing, and editing of musical editions to a very rigorous degree, including the use of source-critical studies. He was influenced by neo-Kantian philosophy. In his Bach biography, he wrote the first major study of German choral and keyboard music of the 17th century (early baroque). =Books= Most of his papers are divided between the library of the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik, the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, and the library of the University of ≈Å√≥dz. He contributed many scholarly articles to periodicals, and wrote articles on Schumann, Spontini, and Weber for Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 1886. *Ein Lebensbild Robert Schumanns (Leipzig, 1862) *Johann Sebastian Bach (Leipzig, 1873‚Äì1880, 1962; English translation: Johann Sebastian Bach.

Fictional team history Trash is a street gang made up of superhuman mutant youths, and it was originally employed by an older mutant drug kingpin named the Garbage Man. The original lineup of Trash included Airhead, Blasting Cap, Brute, Crazy Legs, and Razor Cut. The Garbage Man employed the gang to run drugs to his various crackhouses. On one such mission, Trash encountered and fought Power Pack. Trash allowed the young heroes to follow them back to the Garbage Man‚Äôs headquarters, hoping to trap them. Trash and Garbage Man beat and captured Power Pack, and Garbage Man ordered the gang to kill the members of Power Pack with a lethal overdose of drugs. When Trash refused, they were forced to fight their criminal employer, and they freed Power Pack to help. Blasting Cap blew up the Garbage Man‚Äôs warehouse, but the members of Trash assumed that he had escaped and would find them later. Despite a hefty admonishing by Power Pack, and scarred by their bad experiences with society as they were, Trash surmised that becoming heroes like Power Pack was no option for them. Sometime thereafter, Brute and Airhead left the gang. The three remaining members, Blasting Cap, Crazy Legs, and Razor Cut, relocated to Chicago at some point. There, a young man who dressed like Thor and went by the name of Thor Kid, joined the gang. When Thor Kid attempted to mug a young man named Troop, Thor Kid and Trash were attacked by Luke Cage. The people of the neighborhood united to chase the gang away. Later, Trash approached Troop and offered him membership in the gang, asking him to help them take down Cage. The gang arranged to work for another employer named Rapidfire to acquire guns with armor-piercing rounds to try to kill Cage. Trash tried to ambush Cage, but Troop warned him and a fight ensued. Crazy Legs refused to shoot Cage, so Thor Kid smashed Crazy Legs with his hammer and took the gun. Razor Cut stabbed Thor Kid, telling him Trash would survive without him. Blasting Cap became overexcited by the infighting and caused the building to explode. Cage pulled Blasting Cap and Crazy Legs from the fire, but the fate of Razor Cut and Thor Kid is unknown.

Crichton-Vulcan is an abandoned shipyard in Turku, Finland, that once formed the cornerstone of the Finnish shipbuilding industry. The shipyard is best known for the World War II coastal defence ships and submarines it produced. Shipbuilding at the yard gradually ended after 1976, after a new shipyard had been built in the suburb Perno. The old yard was taken over by Turku Repair Yard and used for ship repair until 2004, when they too moved to the nearby city of Naantali. The shipyard by the Aura River in Turku then lay abandoned some time and was the target of vandalism.Modern Ruins in Finland - Turku Repair Yard However, the site is currently being turned into an upper-class residential area. Demolition of the old buildings began in June 2011. History Vetehinen class submarines side-by-side in the specially built construction hall The first shipyard in Turku was established in 1732 on the eastern bank of the Aura River. The first foundry and metal workshop was established in 1842. After the Crimean War the workshop was acquired by Scotsman William Crichton. Crichton built a new shipyard near the mouth of Aura. Soon a joint-stock company, W:m Crichton & C:o Ab was established, merging smaller shipyards. In 1913 W:m Crichton & C:o Ab went bankrupt, and a new company Ab Crichton was established in its place. √Öbo mekaniska verkstads Ab was founded in 1874 and discontinued at the late 1890s. Ab Vulcan was started in 1898 to continue the operations. In 1924 the manager of Vulcan Allan Staffans organised a merger between the two companies creating Crichton-Vulcan Oy. It again was merged with W√§rtsil√§ between 1936 and 1938. W√§rtsil√§ bought the neighbouring boat and engine builder Andros in 1939 and joined it to Crichton-Vulcan. In 1966 the name of the shipyard was changed to Oy W√§rtsil√§ Ab Turun telakka. Naval ships During World War I, the shipyard served the Imperial Russian Navy. After Finnish independence in 1917, Finland started a program on naval armament. Most of the ships were designed by the Dutch (German) company Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw and built by Crichton-Vulcan.Finnish Navy in World War II The shipyard built two coastal defence ships for the Finnish Navy.

The shipyard also built the prototypes for the World War II German U-boat fleet. Germany was banned under the Treaty of Versailles from building submarines, so work was conducted under foreign dummy companies. Three submarines were ordered in 1927. The submarines were designed by Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw; the design was based on the World War I German Type UB III submarine. The design work and the supervision of the construction was done by Germans. The submarines would serve as a step in the design of the German Type VIIA submarines.Dutch Export Submarines - Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw The Vetehinen, the Vesihiisi and the Iku-Turso were commissioned in 1930 and 1931. A smaller sub, the Vesikko, was launched in 1933. It too was designed by Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw, and was the direct prototype of the German Type II submarine. Successors Freedom of the Seas under construction in Perno, from the old shipyard In the mid-1970s, W√§rtsil√§ built a new, larger shipyard in Perno, from the center of Turku. This new shipyard in now operated by Meyer Turku and produces the world's largest cruise ships, the Freedom class and the Oasis class. After 1983 the old shipyard concentrated solely on ship repair; the last newbuilding entirely built at the old shipyard was M/S Rosella, launched in 1979, but until spring 1983 the old shipyard continued to complete ships that were launched at the new yard and then towed to the old yard. In 1986 W√§rtsil√§'s shipbuilding branch merged with the shipyards of the state-owned Valmet, taking over the Vuosaari shipyard in Helsinki. In 1989 the new company, W√§rtsil√§ Marine, went bankrupt. A new company, Masa-Yards (now STX Europe), headed by yard manager Martin Saarikangas, took over the new shipyard in Turku and W√§rtsil√§'s Helsinki New Shipyard. Another new company, Turku Repair Yard, was established to take over the old repair yard. In 2004 the old yard was abandoned and the company moved to a new shipyard outside the city limits on Luonnonmaa island in Naantali. The company now operates one of the largest dry docks in the Baltic Sea area used solely for ship repair.Turku Repair Yard - company web page It is owned by BLRT Grupp. =Engines= W√§rtsil√§, the company, is today one of the leading producers of large diesel engines for ships and power plants,W√§rtsil√§ - Group structure producing W√§rtsil√§-Sulzer and the W√§rtsil√§-Vasa engines. The engine factory is also located on the Aura riverbank. In 2004 W√§rtsil√§ decided to move production of its diesel engines from Turku to its factory in Italy. Ships M/S Rosella, the last ship launched at the old shipyard, is still serving her original owners A number of ships produced at the old shipyard are still in service, a few examples: *MV Freewinds, the floating \\"university\\" of the Church of Scientology. *In 1975‚Äì76 W√§rtsil√§ delivered five Belorussiya class cruiseferries to the Soviet Union.

History  The NWF (National Wrestling Federation) Heavyweight Championship was created by wrestling promoter Pedro Martinez for his NWF promotion in New York in 1970. The title was mainly defended in the New York/Eastern Canada area, until then-champion Johnny Powers took the belt with him on a tour of Japan with Tokyo Pro Wrestling. Powers would eventually lose the title to Antonio Inoki, who would take the belt with him when he founded New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Inoki became the wrestler most associated with the title due to his high-profile defenses of the title, defeating the likes of Stan Hansen, Andr√© the Giant, Tiger Jeet Singh, and Ernie Ladd while champion. Recognized as a four-time NWF Heavyweight champion, between the years of 1973 and 1983, Inoki was champion for all but six months. Inoki's fourth reign was actually due to the decision to hold up the championship, following a defense against Stan Hansen on April 17, 1981 that ended in a no contest. Inoki later regained the title on April 23, 1981 by defeating Hansen in a rematch. He retired the NWF title immediately after the match due to his desire to enter the 1983 IWGP League. Then as part of a NJPW storyline, the NWF Heavyweight championship was revived in August 2002. Mixed martial arts fighter Kazuyuki Fujita held a tournament to crown a new champion to rival the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The tournament participants were announced to be wrestlers with a background in MMA, including Fujita, Yoshihiro Takayama, Tsuyoshi Kosaka, and Tadao Yasuda. Takayama won the tournament on January 4, 2003, beating Kosaka with a knee kick in the finals to become the first champion in over two decades. Takayama later lost the NWF Championship to Shinsuke Nakamura exactly a year later to unify the NWF and IWGP titles. Nakamura formally announced his vacating of the NWF Heavyweight title on January 5, 2004, retiring the belt for a second time during its history.

A crotyl group is an organic functional group with the formula RCH2CH=CHCH3. Systematically, it is called a but-2-en-1-yl group and exhibits geometric isomerism, being either cis (Z) or trans (E). There are many simple compounds in which the crotyl group forms base carbon chain: crotyl alcohol, crotonaldehyde, crotonic acid, and crotyl acrylate are examples. Synthesis of crotylates Crotylate (crotyl anions) can be synthesised from 2-butene (either isomer): this reaction must be performed in the presence of organometallic reagents, as a base, usually alkyl lithium, or any alkylates of s-block metals, in a solvent, typically THF, and at low temperatures, generally below -20 ¬∞C. The negative charge is delocalised over three of the carbon atoms of the crotylate group and there is resonance between the two possible delocalised forms (one for each terminal carbon). Crotylation reactions Crotylation readily occurs with alkoxy boronates to form crotylboronates. Crotylboronates are useful reagents in the formation of crotyl alcohols. They react with the acidic protons of aldehydes to form alcohols. The mechanism involves a six-membered ring involving the carbonyl oxygen and boron in a chair-like structure.

The game was first published in Germany in 1999 as Rasende Roboter. An English version was published by Rio Grande Games.  Gameplay  The board consists of four double-sided quarters, each with a hole in a corner; these corners meet in the middle of the board, where a plastic piece with four stubs holds them in place. Board quarters can be permuted and flipped over to give 96 different board arrangements. There are also 17 chips, 16 with a symbol on a colored background and one multicolored corresponding exactly to a field on the board. At the beginning of play, four colored robots (also matching the colored fields) are placed randomly on the board and one of the chips is turned over. The object of the game is to bring the robot of the correct colour to the field indicated on the overturned chip using as few moves as possible. Any of the robots can be moved horizontally or vertically, and they do not stop until they reach an obstacle ‚Äî either a wall or another robot. As soon as one of the players has found a solution, they state the total number of moves for all of the robots used and start a timer. Then every player has the chance to state the number of moves for their solution until the time runs out. After that, the player who stated the lowest number of moves shows their solution. If they correctly demonstrate a solution in the stated number of moves or less, they earn the chip. If not, the player with the next higher number may try, and so on; then a new chip is turned over and a new round begins. After all 17 chips have been used up, the player with the most chips wins the game.  Problem-solving implications  Because of Ricochet Robots' game structure and complex problem solving techniques, it has been the subject of academic study. The study, argues that Ricochet Robots is a good game to analyze problem solving techniques of humans and computers. Although Ricochet Robots has an initially exponential increase in complexity, it is solvable by polynomial time algorithms. This is because the number of possible positions is greatly limited by the relatively low number of robots (four or five) and so an efficient algorithm may search through all possible positions.  Editions  Three editions were published by Rio Grande Games. The first edition was called Ricochet Robots (without the s). It was identical to the original Rasende Roboter. This edition was replaced by the 3rd edition. The second edition, called Ricochet Robots (also known as the blue version, because of the blue box), contained one more robot (a black robot) and adds 45 degrees walls on the boards, which complicates the game. The boards of the 2nd and original/3rd editions are compatible and can be mixed up. This edition is out of print at the moment. The third edition is still called Ricochet Robots, but is the same as the original except it adds an extra silver robot.  Variations  54 game variations (different rules) using the silver robot have been added by players.

The Mountaineers won their third consecutive Big East title with a conference record of 7‚Äì0. They ended the season with a 38‚Äì35 Sugar Bowl win over Georgia. Preseason The 2005 season followed a disappointing 2004 campaign, where the Mountaineers started the season with National Championship expectations only to finish the season 8-4. Despite a number of starters returning on defense, the question marks on offense lead many to think the '05 season was going to be a rebuilding year with most national publications picking the Mountaineers to finish behind Louisville and Pitt or lower. With QB Rasheed Marshall and RB K.J. Harris leaving, the quarterback and halfback positions were open. Adam Bednarik and redshirt-freshman Pat White were competing for the spot, with Coach Rich Rodriguez opting to use a rotation that allowed them both to play. It marked the first season for the \\"new\\" Big East, welcoming Louisville, Cincinnati, and South Florida into the league following Boston College leaving to join former members Virginia Tech and Miami in the ACC, and Temple getting kicked out of the league. Schedule Roster #5 Pat White,#10 Steve Slaton #40 Pat Mcafee Game summaries =Syracuse= The 2005‚Äì2006 West Virginia Mountaineers opened the football season at Syracuse. Syracuse was playing its first game under new head coach Greg Robinson. The Mountaineers committed 5 turnovers, including 4 lost fumbles, but managed to hold on to a lead for a 15‚Äì7 win. Syracuse started the scoring with a 5-yard touchdown run by tailback Damien Rhodes. West Virginia tied the game at 7 with Eric Wicks's 32-yard interception return for a touchdown. Right before halftime, the Mountaineers had a chance to take a 10‚Äì7 lead, but freshman place-kicker Pat McAfee missed a 47-yard field goal wide right. He redeemed himself later with a 33-yard field goal with 5:33 left in the third quarter. With just over 8 minutes left in the game, West Virginia's Ernest Hunter tackled Perry Patterson in the end zone for a safety to increase the lead to 12‚Äì7. On West Virginia's next possession they added a 26-yard field goal by McAfee with 3 minutes left. The win brought the Mountaineers record to 1‚Äì0, and the Orangemen fell to 0‚Äì1. The win increased WVU's streak to 4 wins over Syracuse. =Wofford= Backup quarterback Pat White ran for 107 yards and a touchdown to lead West Virginia to a 35-7 victory over I-AA Wofford. West Virginia finished the game with over 500 yards of total offense, and no turnovers. =Maryland= Backup quarterback Pat White directed three fourth-quarter touchdown drives, and West Virginia ripped Maryland's defense for 301 yards rushing in a 31‚Äì19 victory. Freshman Jason Gwaltney scored two touchdowns for the Mountaineers (3‚Äì0), who had lost three straight at Maryland (1‚Äì2) since 1997. West Virginia let a 15-point lead dwindle to 21‚Äì19 before Gwaltney scored on a 15-yard run with 4:56 left. The Mountaineers then recovered a fumble by Maryland quarterback Sam Hollenbach, and Pat McAfee kicked a 40-yard field goal to make it 31‚Äì19 with 2:18 remaining. White went 3-for-5 for 29 yards, but guided an offense that amassed 24 points and 144 yards in the final 15 minutes. =East Carolina= The previous 3 times the Mountaineers played East Carolina were blow-outs, 37‚Äì17, 48‚Äì7, and 56‚Äì23. This one appeared to be another one after the Mountaineers led 20‚Äì6 at half-time. The offense looked terrible the entire game, as they turned the ball over 4 times. Backup quarterback Pat White tossed two interceptions and Adam Bednarik threw one and fumbled once before leaving the game with a knee injury in the first quarter. The defense had to constantly defend short fields, after turnovers in their own territory. The defense only allowed 287 yards and 1 touchdown in the entire game. West Virginia failed to score a single second half point, and managed to escape 20‚Äì15. =Virginia Tech= 3rd ranked Virginia Tech clashed with West Virginia, at Mountaineer Field in a showdown of two 4‚Äì0 unbeaten teams. Virginia Tech had a monster game from their star quarterback, Marcus Vick. The junior completed 15 of 17 passes for 177 yards, and rushed for 74 yards on 12 carries. Virginia Tech jumped out to an early 10‚Äì0 lead, through a West Virginia turnover. Virginia Tech played a solid game, converting 10 out of 15 third down attempts, and having only one turnover. With Virginia Tech leading 24‚Äì17 late in the fourth quarter, a touchdown run sealed the deal for the Mountaineers who fell to 4‚Äì1 on the season. True freshman Steve Slaton was a bright spot for the Mountaineers, rushing for 90 yards on 11 carries. =Rutgers= Steve Slaton ran for a career-high 139 yards and one touchdown to help West Virginia beat Rutgers 27‚Äì14. Jason Gwaltney added 57 yards rushing for West Virginia which beat Rutgers for the 11th straight time. West Virginia rushed for 236 yards against a depleted Rutgers defense, which was without three starters‚Äîlinebacker Terry Bynes, defensive back Jason Nugent and end Eric Foster. =Louisville= In one of the best games of the year, The Louisville Cardinals clashed with the West Virginia Mountaineers who were 5‚Äì1. Louisville completely dominated the first half of play racing to a 17‚Äì0 lead. West Virginia finally got on the board in the third quarter, when Bednarik hit freshman Steve Slaton on a 14-yard screen-pass for a touchdown. Louisville answered with another touchdown in the third quarter, to take a 24‚Äì7 lead after 3 quarters. Early in the 4th quarter starting QB Adam Bednarik left the game with a leg injury and was replaced by Pat White, which proved to be the spark the offense needed. With just over 8 minutes left in the game, Steve Slaton scored a rushing touchdown to make the score 24‚Äì14. With 4:35 left in the game, Pat McAfee kicked a 35-yard field goal to trim the margin to 7. WVU's defense held, and the Mountaineer's came back on offense again. Steve Slaton scored with a minute to go to tie the game at 24‚Äì24, and send the game into overtime. Starting in the third OT teams are forced to go for two following a TD, Pat White hit Jalloh on a pass which ended up being the deciding points. Louisville responded with a Michael Bush touchdown. On the conversion Brian Brohm, unable to find anyone open, attempted to scramble for the conversion but was tackled short, preserving the WVU victory and giving the Mountaineers the inside track for the conference's BCS berth. =Connecticut= Pat White ran for two touchdowns and threw for another in his first start, leading No. 18 West Virginia to a 45‚Äì13 win over Connecticut. West Virginia showed no signs of sluggishness from an 18-day layoff. The Mountaineers built a 35‚Äì3 halftime lead, getting a pair of touchdowns following turnovers. The defense limited UConn to 12 rushing yards and 129 overall, the fewest allowed by West Virginia in three seasons. UConn had one of Division I-A's top defenses statistically, but four of its opponents have a combined record of 3‚Äì29. The nation's ninth-best rushing attack used a rotation of backs to compile 228 yards against the Huskies. White frustrated UConn with his legs and his arm. He ran for 63 yards on 12 carries. White hit Brandon Myles with a 20-yard TD pass early in the second quarter. On the first play of the ensuing drive, West Virginia's Warren Young recovered a fumble at the UConn 20. White then leveled two UConn players on a block that saved teammate Steve Slaton from a big loss. Two plays later, White eluded three defenders on a bootleg run to the right and scored from 14 yards out for a 28‚Äì3 lead. =Cincinnati= Pat White ran for 111 yards, taking off on quarterback draws that set up Steve Slaton's four touchdowns and a 38‚Äì0 victory over Cincinnati. White, Slaton and one of the nation's toughest defenses led the Mountaineers to their most lopsided victory of the season and their first shutout since 2002. White spent the night tormenting the nation's youngest defense. He ran straight up the middle on draws, turned upfield on option fakes, and took off on passing plays. The Mountaineers forced four turnovers and prevented Cincinnati from getting closer than the West Virginia 37-yard line until the final play of the game. =Pittsburgh= Pat White ran for 220 yards on 23 carries to break the Big East rushing record for a quarterback, leading the No. 12 Mountaineers to a 45‚Äì13 victory over Pittsburgh. White ran for two touchdowns and passed for another. The day began with massive snowfall that forced the game to be played on a frozen field with swirling snow flurries and a 7-degree wind chill. West Virginia clinched at least a tie for the Big East title and avenged a 16‚Äì13 loss to Pitt the year before in the Backyard Brawl. White broke the conference quarterback rushing record of 210 yards, set by Michael Vick against Boston College in 2000. White also threw for 41 yards. Steve Slaton rushed for 179 yards on 34 carries to help the Mountaineers finish with 451 total yards on the ground. Slaton ran for two TDs and caught a scoring pass. =South Florida= Pat White ran for 177 yards and two touchdowns, leading West Virginia to a 28‚Äì13 victory over South Florida in the 12th-ranked Mountaineers' final tuneup for a Bowl Championship Series appearance. Nine days after running for 220 yards against Pittsburgh to break the Big East rushing record for a quarterback, White was just as impressive in helping the conference champions finish unbeaten in league play for the first time since 1993. The redshirt freshman scored on second-half runs of 65 and 76 yards and finished with his fourth game with at least 100 yards rushing. He also completed 5 of 10 passes for 89 yards and a touchdown as the Mountaineers amassed 394 yards of total offense‚Äî305 of that on the ground. The victory was the sixth straight for West Virginia (10‚Äì1, 7‚Äì0) and gave the Mountaineers at least 10 wins in a season for the first time since 1993 and just the fifth time in school history. The dominating performance dispelled any notion that the Mountaineers lacked motivation to win their regular-season finale after wrapping up the Big East title and the league's automatic BCS berth when USF (6‚Äì5, 4‚Äì3) lost at Connecticut the week before. Steve Slaton rushed for 89 yards and one touchdown for the Mountaineers, and West Virginia's defense limited Big East rushing leader Andre Hall to 75 yards on 20 carries for South Florida. =Sugar Bowl ‚Äì Georgia= The Sugar Bowl, the second BCS bowl, and the final game of six played on January 2, 2006, was contested at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, having been, like the New Orleans Bowl, displaced from the Louisiana Superdome by Hurricane Katrina. West Virginia, representing the Big East as conference champion, upset Georgia, the winner of the SEC championship game, 38‚Äì35. Georgia was looking for its third straight win in Atlanta in as many appearances, having won its last regular season game (against rival Georgia Tech on the Tech campus) and the SEC championship game (over LSU) at the Georgia Dome, located near the Bulldogs' Athens, Georgia campus, but West Virginia took a 28‚Äì0 lead in the game's first 16 minutes and withstood a furious Georgia comeback before scoring late in the fourth quarter to secure the win. Mountaineers freshman running back Steve Slaton began a career day early, running for a 52-yard score just 2:48 into the game en route to accumulating 204 yards on 26 carries against a Bulldogs defense that entered the game having allowed only 3.5 yards per carry. On the subsequent West Virginia possession, freshman quarterback Pat White accounted 56 yards of a 64-yard scoring drive, connecting with wide receiver Darius Reynaud for a three-yard touchdown pass; Reynaud caught six passes for 50 yards on the day. Just two plays into the next Bulldogs drive, running back Danny Ware lost the first of what would be three Georgia fumbles on the day, and West Virginia took just five plays to go 26 yards, scoring a touchdown on a 13-yard Reynaud run. The Mountaineers defense stymied an additional Georgia drive and forced a fumble by Georgia quarterback D.J. Shockley, setting up a 50-yard drive that culminated in Slaton's second touchdown scamper, an 18-yarder that gave West Virginia a 28-point lead just 15:50 into the game. Shockley began to have success against the Mountaineers defense in the second quarter, completing three straight passes for a total of 46 yards before running back Kregg Lumpkin, who finished the day with 67 yards on nine carries, scored from 34 yards to put Georgia on the board. After their defense forced a West Virginia punt, the Bulldogs went 91 yards in just six plays, with Thomas Brown's scoring on a 52-yard run; Brown has held largely in check the remainder of the game, totaling only 78 yards on nine carries. A long run by West Virginia fullback Owen Schmitt, who finished the day having run for 80 yards on nine carries, set up a 27-yard Pat McAfee field goal, but Shockley, who finished the day having completed 20 of 33 passes for 278 yards and having gained 62 yards on eight carries, drove his team 80 yards in under five minutes and hit wide receiver Leonard Pope, who caught six passes for 52 yards on the day, from four yards to cut the West Virginia halftime lead to 10 points. After combining to give up more than 600 yards in total offense in the first half, both defenses tightened in the second half and although Brown lost a fumble to the Mountaineers, neither team managed a score until 1:44 remained in the third quarter when Shockley hit A.J. Bryant for a 34-yard touchdown to bring the Bulldogs to within three points. White continued to play well through air and on the ground in the fourth quarter, though, and led his team on an 80-yard drive that ended when Slaton ran for a 52-yard touchdown and once more extended the West Virginia lead to ten. For the game, White completed 11 of 14 passes for 124 yards‚Äîcompleting four passes for 64 yards to senior Brandon Myles, his leading receiver‚Äîbut also added 79 yards on 24 carries in contributing to his team's 386-yard rushing performance. Shockley drove his team once more, connecting with Mohamed Massaquoi, whom he four times for 43 yards on the day, to convert a crucial third down and then finding Bryan McClendon, who caught three balls for 72 yards, on a 43-yard scoring drive. The Bulldogs defense held but West Virginia punter Phil Brady successfully carried out a fake punt and ran for a first down, allowing the Mountaineers, behind Slaton and White, to run out the clock, run their season to 11‚Äì1, and prevent the Big East from going winless in four bowls; South Florida, Rutgers, and Louisville had all lost earlier. The game was the final of three games hosted by the Georgia Dome in four days; the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl was held on December 30, and an NFL contest between the Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons was played on January 1, which the Panthers won 44‚Äì11. The game returned to New Orleans in 2007.

It can cause up to 100% crop losses and is virulent against many resistance genes which have previously protected wheat against stem rust. Although Ug99-resistant varieties of wheat do exist, a screen of 200,000 wheat varieties used in 22 African and Asian countries found that only 5-10% of the area of wheat grown in these countries consisted of varieties with adequate resistance. The original race of Ug99, which is designated as 'TTKSK' under the North American nomenclature system, was first characterised in Uganda in 1999 (hence the name Ug99) and has since been detected in Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Egypt. There are now 11 known races of Ug99. They are all closely related and are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor, but differ in their virulence/avirulence profiles and the countries in which they have been detected. Gene resistance Ug99 and its variants differ from other strains of the Black Stem Rust (BSR) pathogen due to their ability to overcome resistance genes in wheat that have been durable against the BSR pathogen for decades. These resistant Sr genes, of which 50 are known, give wheat different resistances to stem rust. The virulence in Uganda was virulent against Sr31 and is specific to Ug99. The massive losses of wheat that have occurred have been devastating, but in recent years the wheat rust epidemic has been effectively controlled through selection and breeding for additional Sr genes. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) researchers are testing genes to substantiate their Ug99 resistance, which will ultimately aid in developments of wheat varieties that will be able to fight off the rust. USDA researchers have stated that resistance has been identified in spring wheat land races and that they are now studying winter wheat land races where resistance is more probable. Due to the fact that the screening of the winter races is more challenging, results from the studies are not expected for another five to seven years. In addition to the research being conducted by the USDA, The United Kingdom‚Äôs Department for International Development (DFID), along with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, announced in February 2011 that they will be granting $40 million to a global project led by Cornell University to combat virulent strains of Ug99. The five-year grant to the Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat (DRRW) project will support attempts to identify new resistance genes as well as reproduce and distribute rust resistant wheat seeds to farmers. Races There are 11 races of Ug99, which (under the North American nomenclature system) have the designations TTKSK, TTKSF, TTKST, TTTSK, TTKSP, PTKSK, PTKST, TTKSF+, TTKTT, TTKTK, and TTHSK. They are all closely related and are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor. TTKSK was the first Ug99 race to be characterised. Like most Ug99 races, and unlike other stem rust varieties, it is virulent against the Sr gene Sr31. It is known to be present in Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen, Iran and Tanzania. TTKST, discovered in Kenya in 2006 was the first Ug99 race found to be virulent against Sr gene Sr24. TTKST is now the predominant stem rust race in Kenya.

With roots dating back to the early history of Poland, it is also observed by expatriate and their descendants Poles in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden and other Polish communities in the world. Origins The tradition of food blessing at Easter, which has early-medieval roots in Christian society, possibly originated from a pagan ritual.Leopold Kretzenbacher. Ethnologia Europaea: Studienwanderungen und Erlebnisse auf volkskundlicher 1986. p. 159Roman Landowski. Dawnych obyczaj√≥w rok ca≈Çy: miƒôdzy wiarƒÖ, tradycjƒÖ i obrzƒôdem. 2000. p. 205 The tradition is said to date from the 7th century in its basic form, the more modern form containing bread and eggs (symbols of resurrection and Christ) are said to date from the 12th century.Ks, Marian Pisarzak MIC.

[przypisy tam≈ºe] Modern times A typical \\"≈öwiƒôconka\\" basket of Polish Holy Saturday tradition Baskets containing a sampling of Easter foods are brought to church to be blessed on Holy Saturday. The basket is traditionally lined with a white linen or lace napkin and decorated with sprigs of boxwood (bukszpan), the typical Easter evergreen. Poles take special pride in preparing a decorative and tasteful basket with crisp linens, occasionally embroidered for the occasion, and boxwood and ribbon woven through the handle. Observing the creativity of other parishioners is one of the special joys of the event. While in some older or rural communities, the priest visits the home to bless the foods, the vast majority of Poles and Polish Americans visit the church on Holy Saturday, praying at the Tomb of the Lord (the fourteenth and final Station of the Cross). The Blessing of the Food is, however, a festive occasion. The three-part blessing prayers specifically address the various contents of the baskets, with special prayers for the meats, eggs, cakes and breads. The priest or deacon then sprinkles the individual baskets with holy water.Swieconka by Ann Hetzel Gunkel Modern ceremony in Poland More traditional Polish churches use a straw brush for aspersing the water; others use the more modern metal holy water sprinkling wand. In some parishes, the baskets are lined up on long tables; in others, parishioners process to the front of the altar carrying their baskets, as if in a Communion line. Older generations of Polish Americans, descended from early 19th-century immigrants, tend to bless whole meal quantities, often brought to church halls or cafeterias in large hampers and picnic baskets. The foods in the baskets have a symbolic meaning: * eggs - symbolise life and Christ's resurrection * bread - symbolic of Jesus * lamb - represents Christ * salt - represents purification * horseradish - symbolic of the bitter sacrifice of Christ * ham - symbolic of great joy and abundance. The food blessed in the church remains untouched according to local traditions until either Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning.

Taxonomy The rufous-vented grass babbler was described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1844 under the binomial name Eurycercus burnesii. Two subspecies are recognised: * L. b. burnesii (Blyth, 1844) - Pakistan and northwest India * L. b. nepalicola Baral, Basnet, Chaudhary, B, Chaudhary, H, Giri & Som, 2008 - Nepal Description Rufous- vented grass babblers average long with a wing length from the bend to the tip of (females) or (males) to . Adults are a cool brown colour above except that a buffy region on the back of the neck and upper back forms a distinct collar. Bold dark streaking starts at the forehead and fades on the back. The underparts are whitish with a tawny hue and dark streaking on the flanks. The undertail coverts are bright rufous or chestnut. The upper surface of the wings has barring formed by the covert feathers and their paler fringes. The wing linings are a faintly tawny off-white. The flight feathers of the wings are greyish brown; when the wing is folded, the primaries barely extend beyond the tertials. Those of the tail may be greyish or olive-brown and have rufous tips. The tail is long and strongly graduated, that is, the outermost pair of feathers is only one-third as long as the central pair. The head shows a conspicuous white eye-ring, whitish lores, and dark-streaked whitish cheeks. The upper mandible is horn-brown; the lower, straw-brown or flesh-brown. The eyes are brown, varying a little in lightness. The legs are flesh-colored or pale brown. From July to September the plumage is worn, especially the tail, which may be much shorter than in fresh plumage and missing the rufous tips. The moult is usually complete by October. Juveniles are similar but have loose, fluffy plumage. They have little or no streaking on the back and their tail tips are rufous, not tawny. They molt into adult head and body plumage, retaining their flight feathers, about 4 to 6 weeks after fledging. Calls include \\"a wheezy feez, and a quiet, very rapid nasal rattle.\\" The song is described as a warble about 4 seconds long, liquid and loud, comparable to that of a dunnock. Range and habitat As treated here, this bird is found only in the plains of the Indus in Pakistan and adjacent in Punjab (India). (However, the swamp grass babbler of Assam and Bangladesh is often combined with this species.) It inhabits a variety of long grasslands, notably plains of sarkhan (Saccharum) but also plains of elephant grass and ekra grass, sometimes where mixed with acacias and tamarisks. It can even occur in deserts with scattered patches of tall grass, and reedbeds. It prefers the vicinity of large rivers and their tributaries or swamps.. Behaviour This species skulks low in grass tussocks, hopping and threading its way through, often in small groups, feeding on insects. It usually holds its tail slightly cocked. When it flies, something that is hard to cause, it goes only to a nearby tussock. It is easiest to find in the breeding season, when it sings in the mornings and evenings. Status The conservation status of the rufous-vented grass babbler is rated at near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is locally common or abundant in the Punjab and northern Sindh but much rarer in southern Sindh.

This form of treatment allows for a therapist to potentially understand the offender and their mental state. It gives the individual providing treatment the opportunity to examine further whether the offender‚Äôs criminal behavior was a conscious act or not, what exactly their association with violent behavior is, and what possible motives could have driven them. The discipline of forensic psychotherapy is one that requires the involvement of individuals other than simply the therapist and patient. A therapist may collaborate with other professionals, such as physicians, social workers, and other psychologists in order to best serve the offenders‚Äô needs. Whether the treatment is successful or not relies on a multitude of things, but typically ensuring that a systemic approach is taken and that all involved in the treatment process are well informed and supportive has proven to be the most effective. In addition to group work, forensic psychotherapy may also involve therapeutic communities, individual interaction with victims as well as offenders, and family work. In order for this specialized therapy to be as effective as possible, it demands the compliance of not only the patient and therapist, but of the rest of society as well. The main focus of forensic psychotherapy is to obtain a psychodynamic understanding of the offender in order to attempt to provide them with an effective form of treatment. Guidelines have been set to ensure proficiency in the field of Forensic Psychology.  Controversy Regarding Treatment  It has been difficult to illustrate a clear link between psychological interventions and the successful reduction of offenses. Nothing has brought about the complete eradication of crime in patients being treated using this practice. At times this difficulty has contributed to a profound pessimism about the effectiveness of any form of treatment.Martinson R. 1974, What Works?- Questions and Answers About Prison Reform. The Public Interest. 35. p 22-54 This began in the United States of America, but pessimism regarding the effectiveness of treatment soon spread to the United Kingdom. Maguire J.What Works: Reducing Offending. Wiley. Chichester. 1999 This was said to have adversely affected the provision of rehabilitative treatments. The development of cognitive behavioral therapy made it possible to demonstrate an effect upon some attitudes and offending behaviors. These behaviors being measured in controlled research studies led to the introduction of structured treatment programs in prisons across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and more recently, mainland Europe. For a period of time, there have been positive benefits in the provision of resources, particularly in prison settings. However, there has been serious conflict as professionals continue to compete for limited resources and one model claimed superiority over another. It has remained difficult to establish with great certainty which methods, if any, are effective over a significant period of time. However, psychodynamic forensic psychotherapy has been shown to have some successful impact, Leichsenring F, Leibing E. The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: a meta-analysis. Am J Psychiatry 2003;160: 1223-32 as have Therapeutic Communities.Taylor R. A seven year reconviction study of HMP Grendon. Home Office Research Unit, London 2000. Role of Forensic Psychologists Forensic psychology conceptualizes both the criminal and civil sides of the justice system, while simultaneously encompassing the clinical and experimental aspects of psychology. Forensic psychologists can receive training as either clinical psychologists or experimental psychologists, and will generally have one primary role in terms of employment. A large portion of forensic psychologists are treatment providers, who evaluate and provide some sort of psychological treatment or intervention. However, many individuals in this field engage in other roles that are more related to their specific interests and/or training. These secondary roles are often involved with the criminal justice system- for example, forensic psychologists often will step in as an expert witness, being called upon to testify in court about a topic in which they have a specialized knowledge.Roesch, R., Zapf, P. A., & Hart, S. D. (2010). Forensic Psychology and law. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. Forensic Psychologists often assume the role of evaluators, typically being asked to evaluate a criminal defendant‚Äôs mental state. This is done in order to determine factors such as whether or not the defendant is competent to stand trial, if the defendant would be a future risk factor, and what the defendant‚Äôs mental state was like at the time in which they committed the alleged offense. Much of the time, once an assessment has been made by the forensic psychologist, they are then asked to testify in court as an expert witness about their findings. Areas of concern include potential risk and confidentiality. Settings There are many different settings in which a forensic psychologist may work. An individual that has specialized knowledge in regards to mental health, as well as the legal system, proves to be a vital asset for the courts and the criminal justice system. Many forensic psychologists spend a significant portion of time working in legal settings, but there are a lot of other locations in which a forensic psychologist can receive training to work at. Police departments, research centers, hospitals, medical examiners offices and universities are also settings in which forensic psychologists are often employed. Community settings are settings in which patients are managed by community forensic teams. Forensic Psychotherapy The aim of forensic psychotherapy is not only to understand the crime an individual has committed, but to understand the person as a whole within his/her environment. Forensic psychotherapy may involve group work, individual work, work with victims, and work with families, as well as within therapeutic communities. Working from the premise that the offender has a complex internal world which may be characterized by punitive and unreliable internal representations of paternal and other figures, psychotherapy can shed light on the unconscious impulses, conflicts, and primitive defense mechanisms, involved in his or her destructive actions and \\"acting out\\". It helps to understand the triggers to the violent acts and timing of the acts. Forensic psychotherapy aims to help the offender understand why they committed the act and take responsibility for it, aiming to prevent future crimes committed. The intimacy and profound experience of therapy may enable an offender to reframe and restructure these harsh images which tend to blunt sensitivities and, when projected out onto others, act as a rationale or driving force for criminal acting out. The patient may develop self-awareness, and an awareness of the nature of their deeds, and ultimately be able to live a more adjusted life. The effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy, as is the case with other psychological therapies, is limited far as behavioral change for antisocial personality or psychopathic offenders. These two types of offenders comprise the primary diagnostic group found in forensic psychotherapy work. The evidence which is emerging, suggests that a range and variety of treatments may be most helpful for such offenders. Treatment of high risk offenders poses particular problems of perverse transference and counter transference which can undermine and confound effective treatment so it would be usual to expect such treatment to be conducted by experienced practitioners who are well supported and supervised. Guidelines for Forensic Psychotherapy In 1931, a group of individuals who established the Association for the Scientific Treatment of Delinquency and Crime developed Forensic Therapy at the Portman Clinic in London. Determined to influence and enhance the understanding of this method of treatment, the International Association for Forensic Psychotherapy (IAFP) was formed in June 1991. The main function of this association is to advance the understanding people have of forensic psychotherapy, including the forms of treatment and risk factors associated with this practice. This helps to promote the health of not only offenders, but of victims as well. The American Academy for Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society published the Speciality Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists in 1991. It provides direction to forensic psychologists in identifying competent practice, practicing responsibly, establishing relationships with parties involved and identifying issues. APA also created guidelines in the 1990s for new forensic psychologists. In 1994 the Guidelines for Child Custody Evaluations in Divorce Proceedings was adopted by the APA Council of Representatives to promote proficiency. In 1998 the Guidelines for Psychological Evaluations in Child Protection Matters was adopted by the APA Council of Representatives as well. Certification is done statewide and nationwide to ensure competence. More classes are being offered in Forensic Psychology and more opportunities are available at the graduate and post graduate level.

The title is set during the Three Kingdoms era and takes place after the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Dong Zhuo's death. The gameplay uses elements from Koei's in depth turn based system in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. While the Dynasty Warriors series is a contemporary interpretation of the setting, the mood in Dynasty Tactics is archaic and gritty, closer to the tone set in the novel. The players can choose to roughly follow events from the epic or dramatically diverge from it. The game was followed by a sequel in 2003. Gameplay The game is basically separated into two different phases: the planning stage (or turns) and battles. Turns occur on a bird's eye map of the area with color coded cities to differentiate the rulers of each section of the land. Each ruler is assigned a capital which will serve as their base of operations; if it falls, the lord of the land will be overthrown. From there, they can decide to check on their armies, search for civilians who will join their cause, or assign envoys to recruit men and spy on the enemy. If a ruler has enough spare officers, he can also create another army to fortify their land's defenses. Additionally, cities with no alignment can be effortlessly claimed if the player places an army on it. Each segment of the story has set objectives with a number of turns given to decide how to complete it. Objectives are basically stepping stones for the ruler's motivation and method of conquest. For instance, Liu Bei can forge an alliance with Lu Bu or declare war on him instead. The ultimate goal of the game is to unite the land under one ruler but the method of doing so is up to the player. Battles take place on a grid map system and are often limited to 30 days (or 30 turns). Only two forces can fight at one time and each side is allowed two armies (or eight units) in one battle. Envoys with the Spy skill can also participate in battle. Armies are composed of one commander, one strategist, and two other officers. When two allied armies are on the field, the commander with the highest leadership is designated as their side's main commander in battle. Strategists are the ones who set army formations and assist their army with a Trump action, a random event which can turn the tide of battle. Like many other strategy games, battles are won when the leading enemy commander is forced to flee. Moving on the map is similar to chess in that unit types have varying levels of movement (i.e.: horsemen can move more squares forward than the footmen). The order of each unit is decided by whoever has the highest morale during a day of battle. The battlefield's terrain also affects how armies can proceed on the map. After a successful move, the army will be asked to face either north, south, west, or east. Their positioning affects the unit's capability to defend from attacks or help allies. When a square within a unit's movement range is red, the particular unit can perform a special command called a Tactic. These commands vary with each job class; some are purely offensive, while others only target morale or aid allies. If two or more units are in a position to use their tactics together, they can perform a combo to double or even triple the tactics' effects. The combo's length is decided by the amount of generals who can perform their techniques during one attack. As the combo grows in length, the animations for the tactics look visually more impressive. Strategists can also choose to create a fragile yet handy Tactics Link, which gives allies a combo multiplier from their tactics at any position on the map. Tactic combos are the ideal way to quickly end a battle and save resources. Combos are also the most convenient way to capture an enemy general and have them serve the player's army. All officers are also given unique buffs that are triggered by unit placement or morale.

Early life and career  Assala was born in Damascus, Syria to a middle class couple. Mostafa Nasri, Assala's father, was a revered composer and singer. Assala began her musical career by performing patriotic, religious, and children's songs when she was four years old. She sang the theme song \\"Qessas Al Sho'oub\\" (), of the cartoon show, Hekayat Alamiyah (). In 1984, Mostafa Nasri died after suffering from internal bleeding caused by a car accident. Aged 15 she helped to take care of her siblings Aman, Ayham, Reem and Anas with her mother Aziza Al-Babelli. Assala's commercial musical career debuted in 1991 with the Egyptian song hit Law Ta'rafou (Egyptian Arabic: ŸÑŸà ÿ™ÿπÿ±ŸÅŸà). The album had 4 Egyptian songs in the oriental operatic Classic Egyptian tarab style. The album was an instant hit in Egypt back at that time with heartbreaking songs like \\"Ya Sabra Yana\\" and \\"Samehtak Ketir\\". She quickly cemented her presence in the Arabic world a growing industry brimming with singers like Angham, Najwa Karam, Latifa, and Abdelmajeed Abdullah. Ever since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, in 2011, Assala Nasri claimed her support for the Syrian people and her commitment against Bashar al Assad. Her positions towards the Civil War are humanitarian, in which she wants the conflict to end for the sake of the Syrian civilians. She had her first composing experience in the writing of one song, released in 2011. For her commitment in the conflict, Assala sang at the International Peace day as a new ambassador for \\"Peace Building Through Music.\\" However, Assala was criticized for her position, due to the fact that Hafez Al-Assad authorized her treatment from polio. She was arrested on Monday, June 26, 2017 in Beirut International Airport at the behest of Lebanese officials who support Bashar al-Assad for the crime of fraternizing with Israel. She had recently performed in Palestine. Elie Chalala, \\"Asala a Thorn in Assad's Side, her arrest a black eye for the Lebanese government.\\" Al Jadid2014. https://www.aljadid.com/content/asala-thorn-assads-side-her-arrest-black-eye- lebanese-government She was placed under house arrest, then quickly released, for lack of evidence, but some pro-Syrian outlets never corrected their claims that she was arrested for carrying drugs. In 2019, Assala performed \\"Right Where I'm Supposed to Be\\" as the Official Song of the 2019 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Avril Lavigne, Luis Fonsi, Hussain Al Jassmi and Tamer Hosny.  Television  Assala hosts a television program which is called Soula (), on Al Hayat TV and Dubai TV. The show presents guest musicians as though they were visiting Assala in her home in Cairo, Egypt.  Personal life  Assala's first marriage was to Ayman Al Dahabi, when she was still young. Her first daughter, Sham, was born in 1992 when she was only 22 years old, and her first son, Khaled, in 1998. She was divorced in 2005 after more than 15 years of marriage. After the divorce, she took care of her two children by her own. Her second marriage was to a Palestinian-American director, Tarek Al Eryan, on 26 March 2006. She was pregnant with Tarek's child in early 2007, but suffered a miscarriage halfway through the pregnancy. In May 2011, she gave birth to twin boys, Adam and Aly, via IVF. In an Instagram post dated January 6, 2020, Assala announced her divorce from her husband Tarek. Assala currently lives in Cairo with her four children, Sham, Khaled, Adam, and Aly. Assala is a Sunni Muslim. She was granted Bahraini citizenship by Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa a few days after she gave a performance in the operetta Love and Loyalty in celebration of Bahrain‚Äôs Independence Day. Assala holds two citizenships; Syrian (primary nationality) and Bahraini (second nationality).

A Queensland State of Origin representative forward, he played ten seasons with the Brisbane Broncos and finished his career playing rugby union for the ACT Brumbies. Biography Ryan attended Downlands College in Toowoomba. After representing Australia in rugby union as a schoolboy, he first played rugby league for Wattles Warriors in the TRL (Toowoomba Rugby League), before playing for the Brisbane Rugby League premiership's Western Suburbs club, Ryan moved to the Broncos in 1990. =Professional playing career= In the weeks following the Broncos' inaugural premiership win Ryan travelled with the club to England, where he played from the interchange bench in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first NSWRL club to win the match in Britain. A handy utility forward, the following season he was part of the Broncos' 1993 Winfield Cup triumph. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Ryan played from the interchange bench for defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge. Also during the 1994 season, Ryan was suspended for three matches after being found guilty of biting South Sydney player Jason Bell. In 1997 Ryan debuted for Queensland and was named the Broncos' player of the year in a premiership- winning season, Ryan's second title with the club. Only a suspension, which ruled him out of the 1998 NRL grand final, denied him the opportunity of winning a third premiership with the Broncos in 1998. At the end of 1999, Ryan left the Broncos to play rugby union with the ACT Brumbies. Ryan was the first person in history to win grand finals in the NRL and the Super 12, as it was then known. This feat has since only been matched by Brad Thorn in 2008, and Will Chambers and Sonny Bill Williams in 2012. During 2001's pre-season, Wendell Sailor declared he was \\"leaning towards\\" switching codes from rugby league to rugby union following advice from former Broncos teammate Ryan. =Post-playing= During the 2000s Ryan, who has been described by Craig Bellamy as \\"one of the most devastating defenders to have played the game\\", returned to the Brisbane Broncos as a part-time defence coach. Renowned during his playing days for his tough and uncompromising tackling technique, Ryan was appointed as a 'contact' coach for the North Queensland Cowboys before switching to a similar role with the ACT Brumbies rugby union team in Super Rugby. He was signed as defensive coach of the Queensland Reds for the 2019 season.

Named for Nestor (in Greek mythology, the son of Neleus, the King of Pylos and Chloris), she was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction Laid down as LST-518 on 13 September 1943, by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company of Seneca, Illinois; launched 20 January 1944; sponsored by Miss Rita Jenkins; converted by the Maryland Drydock Company of Baltimore, Maryland; and commissioned 24 June 1944, with Commander Frank W. Parsons, USNR, in command. Service history Designed to make emergency repairs in forward areas to battle-damaged ships, Nestor left Norfolk 4 August 1944, for Guantanamo Bay, the Panama Canal, and Ulithi, arriving 21 October, to take up her primary mission. During the next five and a half months she acted as tender to small craft and repaired all types of naval vessels from battleships to LCIs. Nestor left Ulithi 19 April 1945, for Kerama Retto, seized in the initial phase of the Okinawa campaign to serve as a base for the ships engaged in the main assault. Japanese air attacks, often by suicide plane, inflicted heavy damage on the fleet, and Nestor worked round-the-clock, often under fire herself, to help keep the fighting ships in action. As Okinawa itself became secure, Nestor entered Buckner Bay 10 July, and continued her vital services, which here included the tremendous task of building a cofferdam. Nestor was driven aground by wind and heavy seas in the devastating Typhoon \\"Louise\\" of 9 October, and had to be abandoned. She decommissioned on 29 November, was stricken on 3 January 1946, and her hulk was sold for scrap on 1 May 1947.

A PCTFHR fact-finding mission was organized for November 2006. The group consisted of nine Canadians - lawyers, a teacher, a nurse and other community organizers - who visited victims of the political killings and repression in the Philippines. As well, the group met with members of Congress, Members of the Senate, Peter Sutherland, the Canadian Ambassador to the Philippines. The group's modus operandi was to split up into groups to evaluate the deteriorating human rights situation in various regions. The areas of Metro Manila, Cordillera, Southern Tagalog and Central Luzon were selected. One of the congressmen met by the Fact-finding mission was Rep.Crispin Beltran who had been detained for almost a year.

The basic 35 mm anamorphic format originally popularized as CinemaScope has been known by a number of other monikers. In some cases, these names actually refer to different lens designs and technologies implemented; however, the great majority are simply re- branded lenses originally known by another name. In recent decades, it has generally been considered a clich√© throwback, and thus the generic name of anamorphic format has become predominant. All of the following trade names refer to the modern SMPTE-standard anamorphic 35 mm format or what was regarded as the standard at that time. Generically speaking, this means a 2√ó anamorphosis lens with 4-perf negative pulldown for both image origination and projection, and an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 until 1970 (requiring special, narrow \\"negative assembly\\" splices) and 2.39:1 after 1970 (using conventional \\"negative assembly\\" splices). The change from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1 (sometimes rounded to 2.4:1 or, mathematically incorrectly, to 2.40:1) was mainly intended to facilitate \\"negative assembly\\", and also to better hide \\"negative assembly\\" splices, which otherwise may appear as a slight \\"flash\\" at the upper edge of the frame, during a splice.

It is just south of Llangynllo/Llangunllo, halfway between Cardigan and Lampeter. Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet rebuilt the original 18th-century house in the Gothic Revival style in the 1850s. The family sold the house in 1937 after the death of Sir Thomas' son and daughter-in-law; after World War II the house was stripped of its fittings and has been left in ruins. History Bronwydd Mansion Ruins Bronwydd replaced Cilrhiwe as the main family home in the 1850s, at which time it was rebuilt in the fashionable gothic revival style by Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet. The architect was Richard Kyrke Penson, who skillfully adapted an existing 18th-century house to create an elaborate Victorian gothic 'castle' suitable for the 'Marcher Lord' of Cemais. The 18th- century house contained a private chapel, the Lloyds of that era having been converts to Methodism, while the reconstructed Bronwydd included a baronial hall, containing the family muniments and serving as entrance hall. The exterior of the building included a tall, slim round tower and a square tower with bell-turret. Part of the house is supposed to have been modelled on the cathedral transept and tower of the Rock of Cashel, Ireland, although Thomas Lloyd described the whole as 'a romantic Rhineland castle with patterned roof- tiling.' The stables and service block were rendered in mock half-timber, similar to the streets of Chester. The house was sited on a bluff overlooking the river Afon Cynllo. The interiors were splendid, with painted mottoes above the doors, a profusion of carved stone, stained glass and mural paintings. The expense of such medieval fantasies rested heavy on the estate, which was in debt to the tune of ¬£100,000 when Sir Thomas' son, Sir Marteine Lloyd inherited the estate in 1877. Prudent management and the sale of outlying lands restored some solvency to the estate in the years prior to the First World War. The death of Sir Marteine's son, Arundel Keymes Lloyd in the Great War doomed the estate, however. The Inland Revenue demanded death duties on the estate, which had been made over to Arundel Lloyd in order to avoid those same duties. For much of the post-war period, Sir Marteine and Lady Lloyd lived away from Bronwydd, although they celebrated their Golden Wedding in 1928 in some style. Sir Marteine Lloyd died in 1933, and Lady Lloyd attempted to let the house, which ended up housing illegal aliens. On Lady Lloyd's death in 1937, the house and grounds were sold. The sale of land close to the mansion for forestry work doomed the house. After housing a Jewish boarding school, Aryeh House School, in the Second World War, and aliens thereafter, the house, then known as Bronwydd Castle, was stripped. Substantial parts of the house remained roofed into the 1980s. The round tower fell in the early years of the 21st century, and much of the house has disappeared.

The collection was originally started in 1908 and completed in 1909, and comprised 85 pieces which were issued in four volumes. Each piece is based on a folk tune, Hungarian in the first two volumes (42 pieces), and Slovak in the last two (43 pieces). In 1945, Bart√≥k revised the set, removing six pieces which used tunes which had been inaccurately transcribed or found not to be original folk tunes, and substantially changing the harmonization of a number of others; the cycle, now of 79 pieces, was reissued in two volumes (of 40 and 39 pieces). The pieces were written as student works, and progress slightly in difficulty through each half of the cycle.

Foley was the son of Thomas Foley MP and his wife Hester (n√©e Andrews) and was educated at Westminster School (1724‚Äì732) and Trinity College, Cambridge (from 1732). The Foley family descended from the prominent ironmaster Thomas Foley. He succeeded his father in 1749, inheriting the Stoke Edith estate in Herefordshire. Foley was also the cousin, namesake and heir of Thomas Foley, 2nd Baron Foley (a title which became extinct on the latter's death in 1766), thus also inheriting Witley Court and the extensive Great Witley estate. This included ironworks at Wilden and Shelsley Walsh, which were leased about at the end of his life. He was elected to the House of Commons for Droitwich in 1741, a constituency he represented until 1746 and again from 1754 to 1768, followed by election to represent Herefordshire between 1768 and 1776. The latter year the title previously held by his cousin was revived when Foley was raised to the peerage as Baron Foley of Kidderminster in the County of Worcester. Lord Foley married the Hon.

In other words, it is a confrontation and/or opposition to existing status quo and its legitimacy in politics, but can also be observed in various other spheres of life, such as history, media, music, etc. Neo-Gramscian theorist Nicola Pratt (2004) has described counter-hegemony as \\"a creation of an alternative hegemony on the terrain of civil society in preparation for political change\\".Pratt, N. (2004), Bringing politics back in: examining the link between globalisation and democratization, Review of International Political Economy [online], Vol. 11, No. 2, [accessed: 28 May 2010], pp. 331-336, Available at: https://www.jstor.org/pss/4177500 According to Theodore H. Cohn, \\"a counterhegemony is an alternative ethical view of society that poses a challenge to the dominant bourgeois-led view\\".Global Political Economy: Theory and Practice, Theodore H. Cohn, Other Paperback Editions, June 2004, , page 131 If a counterhegemony grows large enough it is able to subsume and replace the historic bloc it was born in. Neo-Gramscians use the Machiavellian terms war of position and war of movement to explain how this is possible. In a war of position a counterhegemonic movement attempts, through persuasion or propaganda, to increase the number of people who share its view on the hegemonic order; in a war of movement the counterhegemonic tendencies which have grown large enough overthrow, violently or democratically, the current hegemony and establish themselves as a new historic bloc. An example of counter-hegemony in politics is the \\"anti-globalization movement\\". An example of counter-hegemony in media could be a documentary questioning the government‚Äôs involvement in a war.Cohn, T. H. (2004), Global Political Economy: Theory and Practice, Other Paperback Editions, , page 131 Origins of the concept The term \\"hegemony\\" came from the writings of Karl Marx and was conceptualized by Antonio Gramsci, a Marxist social philosopher who lived in Mussolini's Italy. Because Gramsci was a Marxist, he subscribed to the basic Marxist premise of the historical dialectic. Therefore, according to classic Marxist theories, societies will transform over time from oppressive economic systems to more and more liberating ones, until finally the state of communism in society is reached. In his writings Gramsci claims that intellectuals create both hegemony and counter-hegemony. He argues that \\"there is no organization without intellectuals,\\" for to be without them is to be without \\"the theoretical aspect of the theory-practice nexus essential to all effective organizations\\".Simms, R. (2003), \\"I am a Non-Denominational Christian and a Marxist Socialist: A Gramscian Analysis of the Convention People‚Äôs Party and Kwame Nkrumah‚Äôs Use of Religion\\", Association for the Sociology of Religion, Inc., Vol. 64, No. 4, pp. 463-477 Counter-hegemonic actions Counter-hegemonic groups of people do not start off as radical or extremist groups; they encourage people to share their view against hegemony through the use of persuasion and/or propaganda whilst raising awareness. One view describes the possibility that once the counter-hegemonic group has gained enough support and consensus against the current powers, they would then attempt to overthrow them, whether through violence or democracy. Depending on whether full power is given to each individual, or if it is kept among a close few could be the deterministic factor between a decentralized government and a dictatorship.Barden, T (2010), \\"Exploring the concept of Hegemony and Counter-Hegemony within the modern world and how, as a designer, I can influence for the better\\", Theoretically Interesting Publications  See also  * Counter-hegemonic globalization * Critical terrorism studies * Cultural hegemony * Far-left politics * Power (social and political)  References  Category:Marxism ","title":"Counterhegemony"},{"id":"10522162","text":"Urs Kunz (born 13 January 1974) was a Swiss Nordic combined skier who competed from 1997 to 2000.

The Santal typically use the Tumdak' in combination with the Tamah' for religious ceremonies and Santal festivals. Both drums are almost universally played by men rather than women. The body of the drum is cylindrical and made from clay. The two heads of the drum are usually cowhide, the right one being slightly smaller than the left. Like many similar Indian drums, each head has a round patch of tuning paste in the center which enhances the sound. When played for dancing, the Tumdah' player suspends the drum around his neck with a cord or leather strap. The Tumdah' falls within the larger category of double-headed hand-struck Indian drums, which have various names: Dholak, Nal, Mridangam. The player strikes the Tumdak' with full hand and fingers as required by the musical pattern.

Sir William Macleod Bannatyne, Lord Bannatyne FRSE (26 January 1743 ‚Äì 30 November 1833) was a distinguished Scottish advocate, judge, antiquarian and historian. Life The son of Mr. Roderick Macleod, writer to the signet and Isabel (fl. 1736‚Äì1744), daughter of Hector Bannatyne of Kames. He received a liberal education, including a period at the High School of Edinburgh (1755-6), and was admitted advocate, 22 January 1765. He was appointed Sheriff of Bute in 1776. On the death of Lord Swinton, in 1799, he was promoted to the bench, and took his seat as Lord Bannatyne. Among his intimate friends were Henry Mackenzie, Robert Cullen, William Craig, Hugh Blair, Erskine and Alexander Abercromby. He was a member of the Mirror Club and Lounger Club, at the end of the eighteenth century. In 1784 he was a co- founder of the Highland Society. He assumed the name of Bannatyne when he succeeded, through his mother to the estate of Kames in the Isle of Bute. He extended Kames Castle by the addition of a fine mansion house in the early eighteenth century. He sold the Kames estate in 1812 to James Hamilton, and moved to Edinburgh. He retired in 1823, when he was knighted. He died at his home, Whitefoord House on the Canongate section of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh in 1833.

JEDEC Standard 100B.01 specifies common terms, units, and other definitions in use in the semiconductor industry. JESC21-C specifies semiconductor memories from the 256 bit static RAM to DDR4 SDRAM modules. JEDEC standardization goals The Joint Electron Device Engineering Council characterizes its standardization efforts as follows: JEDEC Standard 100B.01 JEDEC Standard 100B.01 is entitled Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols for Microcomputers, Microprocessors, and Memory Integrated Circuits. The purpose of the standard is to promote the uniform use of symbols, abbreviations, terms, and definitions throughout the semiconductor industry. =Units of information= The specification defines the two common units of information:Ref. ANSI X3.172. * The bit (b) is the smallest unit of information in the binary numeration system and is represented by the digits 0 and 1. * The byte (B) is a binary character string typically operated upon as one unit. It is usually shorter than a computer word. =Unit prefixes for semiconductor storage capacity= The specification contains definitions of the commonly used prefixes kilo, mega, and giga usually combined with the units byte and bit to designate multiples of the units. The specification cites three prefixes as follows: * kilo (K): A multiplier equal to 1024 (210). * mega (M): A multiplier equal to 1,048,576 (220 or K2, where K = 1024). * giga (G): A multiplier equal to 1,073,741,824 (230 or K3, where K = 1024). The specification notes that these prefixes are included in the document only to reflect common usage. It refers to the IEEE/ASTM SI 10-1997 standard as stating, that \\"this practice frequently leads to confusion and is deprecated\\". However the JEDEC specification does not explicitly deprecate the common usage. The document further refers to the description of the IEC binary prefixes in Amendment 2 of IEC 60027-2, \\"Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology\\", for an alternate system of prefixesQuote from JEDEC Standard 100B.01, page 8: and includes a table of the IEC prefixes in the note. However the JEDEC specification does not explicitly include the IEC prefixes in the list of general terms and definitions. The document notes that these prefixes are used in their decimal sense for serial communication data rates measured in bits. JESD21-C The standard JESD21-C: Configurations for Solid State Memories is maintained by JEDEC committee JC41. This committee consists of members from manufacturers of microprocessors, memory ICs, memory modules, and other components, as well as component integrators, such as video card and personal computer makers. Standard 21 is published in loose-leaf binder format to accommodate frequent updates. The documentation of modern memory modules, such as the standards for the memory ICs and a reference design of the module requires over one hundred pages. The standards specify the physical and electrical characteristics of the modules, and include the data for computer simulations of the memory module operating in a system. Memory modules of the DDR2-SDRAM type are available for laptop, desktop, and server computers in a wide selection of capacities and access speeds. The standards specify memory module label formats for end-user markets. For example: > 1GB 2Rx4 PC2-3200P-333-11-D2 is a 1 GB DDR2 Registered DIMM, with > address/command parity function, using 2 ranks of x4 SDRAMs operational to > PC2-3200 performance with CAS Latency = 3, tRCD = 3, tRP = 3, using JEDEC > SPD revision 1.1, raw card reference design file D revision 2 used for the > assembly.

She applied for admission into the University of Oklahoma law school in order to challenge the state's segregation laws and to become a lawyer.Hall, Melvin C., \\"Fisher, Ada Lois Sipuel (1924-1995) ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed June 15, 2010). She was born in Chickasha, Oklahoma and was the daughter of a minister, Rev. Travis B. Sipuel, and his wife, the former Martha Belle Smith. Early life Fisher graduated from Lincoln High School in 1941 as valedictorian. She enrolled in the Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal College (now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff), but transferred to Langston University in 1942. After marrying in 1944, she graduated May 21, 1945, with honors. Supreme Court case Her brother planned to challenge segregationist policies of the University of Oklahoma, but went to Howard University Law School in Washington, D.C. to not delay his career further by protracted litigation. Fisher was willing to delay her legal career in order to challenge segregation. In 1946, she applied at the University of Oklahoma and was denied because of race. Two years later, in 1948, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla. that the state of Oklahoma must provide instruction for blacks equal to that of whites. Thurgood Marshall acted as the head NAACP lawyer for this case and the justices ruled unanimously.[ Address to the American Bar Association ‚Äì John Paul Stevens ‚Äì August 6, 2005] The case was also a precursor for Brown v. Board of Education. Legal education In order to comply, the state of Oklahoma created the Langston University School of Law, located at the state capital. Further litigation was necessary to prove that this law school was inferior to the University of Oklahoma College of Law. Finally, on June 18, 1949, Sipuel was the first African-American admitted to the University of Oklahoma's law school. becoming the first African-American woman to attend a previously segregated, all-white public law school in Oklahoma. By this time, she was married and pregnant with the first of her two children. The law school gave her a chair marked \\"colored,\\" and roped it off from the rest of the class. Despite this, her classmates and teachers welcomed her, shared their notes and studied with her, helping her to catch up on the materials she had missed. The Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Garden located on the north part of the main campus in honor of the first African-American to be admitted to the OU College of Law in 1948. Sipuel had to dine in a separate chained-off guarded area of the law school cafeteria. She recalled that years later some white students would crawl under the chain and eat with her when the guards were not around. Her lawsuit and tuition were supported by hundreds of small donations, and she believed she owed it to those donors to make it. Later career She graduated in 1951 with a Master of Laws degree and began practicing law in her hometown of Chickasha in 1952. In 1992, Oklahoma governor David Walters appointed her to the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, which she noted in an interview, \\"completes a forty-five year cycle.\\" She further stated, \\"Having suffered severely from bigotry and racial discrimination as a student, I am sensitive to that kind of thing,\\" and she planned to bring a new dimension to university policies. Before her death in 1995, Fisher was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and also was a professor at Langston University. She died of cancer, in Oklahoma City in October 1995. In 1996 she was inducted posthumously in the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame. The University of Oklahoma dedicated the Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Garden in her honor.

Its construction was sponsored by Mrs. Mary V. Haines, wife of the ship's name sake. Haines was commissioned on 27 December 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Elmer C. Powell in command. Haines was named in honor of Lieutenant Richard Alexander Haines, who served aboard the when it suffered a devastating torpedo hit in the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November 1942. Lieutenant Haines remained at his station to assist in controlling the damage until overcome by asphyxiating gas generated by the explosion. He had given his life to save his shipmates and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism. Service history =Destroyer escort, 1944= Haines conducted shakedown training off Bermuda, and after final acceptance in February 1944, performed various duties until April. These included escorting a Dutch submarine to the United States from the Netherlands, sailing with a troop convoy to Panama and back, and serving as a training ship for new destroyer escort crews at Norfolk, Virginia. Early in April, Haines assumed duty as a target towing ship at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where she helped ready young pilots for duty with American squadrons overseas. Overseas duty was not long in coming for Haines. She was soon assigned to a Mediterranean convoy, leaving from New York and arriving at Casablanca on 7 June 1944. After returning to New York, Haines again sailed for the Mediterranean on 30 June 1944, this time with a carrier task group. The group paused at Malta before proceeding to Alexandria, Egypt to guard against the Axis attack on that port. Detached from the task group, Haines next took an active part in the vast armada that invaded southern France. Departing Naples on 13 August, she escorted troop transports to the assault area, and later acted as a screening ship for the gunfire support group offshore. She also performed mine clearing in the port of Marseilles. Haines continued her escort duties into September as the Allied advance gained momentum, acting as escort to an LST group ferrying supplies from Corsica to France. Haines completed her Mediterranean service on 1 November 1944 and sailed for the United States, via Oran. She arrived at New York on 11 December and immediately entered the Brooklyn Navy Yard for conversion into a high speed transport. =High speed transport, 1945= Completed on 1 March 1945, Haines was re-designated APD-84. She then served for several months at Norfolk and in Chesapeake Bay as a training ship for fast transport and destroyer escort crews. Receiving orders to return to combat duty, Haines sailed from Norfolk for the Panama Canal on 8 August 1945. She received word of the war's end while at Crist√≥bal, Canal Zone and proceeded to San Diego, California, where she continued to Pearl Harbor in early September. Haines was then designated to transport units of the strategic bombing survey team. One of the more significant things the crew of the ship had done was doing a report of Hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped. Crew member Thomas Magnifico said \\"The only thing standing was a concrete smoke stack.\\" After extensive preparations, Haines departed from Guam for Japan on 2 October 1945. For the next two months, the ship stopped at various Japanese ports while technicians and analysts from the strategic bombing survey team gathered data on the effectiveness of the aerial bombardments. Haines departed Tokyo Bay on either Nov. 30 or - more likely on Dec.1,1945 filled with technicians who had participated in \\"USSBS\\" (U.S.Strategic Bomb Survey) and she arrived at Apra Harbor, Guam on Dec. 5, 1945. David Keller, a prominent air gunner/photographer, was aboard. Haines was detached from this duty at Guam and departed on 6 December 1945, filled with returning Marines. She arrived at San Diego on 24 December 1945. =Decommissioning and sale= Scheduled for deactivation, Haines sailed for the East Coast via the Panama Canal, arriving in Boston on 12 January 1946. She subsequently sailed to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she was decommissioned on 29 April 1946, and went into reserve. Haines was struck from the Navy List on 1 June 1960 and was sold for scrap to North American Smelting Co., on 19 May 1961.

The son of Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet, he was educated at Eton College and afterwards by a private tutor. He inherited the Bronwydd estate in 1877, at the age of twenty-six, on the death of his father. The total debt facing the young squire was ¬£100,000, several million in today's terms. While Lloyd made good progress towards paying off these debts, he never entirely succeeded, and the death of his only son and heir, Marteine Arundel Keymes Lloyd at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, rendered the actions a moot point. He married, in 1878, Katherine Helena, daughter of Alexander Dennistoun of Golfhill, Glasgow. As well as a son, the couple had three daughters, Nesta, Peverel and Joan. Lloyd served as a Justice of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant of Cardiganshire and was appointed High Sheriff of the county for 1881. In addition, he served as a Master of Fox Hounds. Political career He unsuccessfully contested the Parliamentary Constituency of East Carmarthenshire in 1885, even though he admitted that the constituency was not well-known to him. This was seen as an action that had disastrous consequences for the reputation of the Lloyds. Local politics Lloyd sought election, as Conservative candidate for the Troedyraur ward, to Cardiganshire County Council at the first elections in 1889 but was defeated by a local farmer, John Powell. In 1892 he narrowly won a by-election at New Quay and remained as a councillor in 1898. He was subsequently made an alderman and served for two terms between 1898 and 1910. Later life The fortunes of the family declined after the war, because the Inland Revenue sought the payment of death duties. In an attempt at tax avoidance, Sir Marteine had transferred the estate to his son shortly before the latter's death on the Somme. The baronetage became extinct on Sir Marteine's death, and Lady Lloyd died in 1937.

Roy (\\"Ten-O-Five\\"), one of several Anhalt buildings with Seattle city landmark status Frederick William (\\"Fred\\") Anhalt (March 3, 1896 ‚Äì July 17, 1996)A small profile in the Seattle Times was a builder and contractor who constructed many distinguished rental apartment buildings in Seattle, Washington in the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1993, the Seattle Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) awarded Anhalt an honorary membership in recognition of excellence in residential design. In 2001, The Seattle Times listed Anhalt as one of the 150 most influential people in Seattle HistoryMetropoLIST 150: People Who Shaped Seattle: http://seattletimes.com/news/local/seattle_history/articles/metropolist_p2.html His buildings have been referred to as \\"Castles in Seattle.\\" Anhalt designed and constructed more than 40 buildings in Seattle between 1925 and 1942. Anhalt's designs reflect Norman, Tudor, and Spanish Mission architectural influences, and incorporate both architectural flourishes and modern construction techniques that were uncommon in mainstream residential architectural projects of the pre-war period. Three of Anhalt's buildings are listed as Seattle Historic Landmarks.Seattle Department of Neighborhoods, Individual Landmarks: Greater Capitol Hill: http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/capitol.htm Three other Anhalt buildings are part of the Harvard-Belmont Historic District in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Early career Fred Anhalt moved to Seattle from the midwest in the early 1920s. After working as a grocer and appliance salesman, Anhalt and partner Jerome B. Hardcastle, a former butcher, founded the Western Building & Leasing Company in 1925 in order to build small commercial buildings, primarily markets, in Seattle's outlying neighborhoods such as Ballard, Greenwood, Beacon Hill, West Seattle, and North Queen Anne Hill. Anhalt's company soon branched out from commercial buildings and began to design and build bungalow-style houses and Bungalow court apartment buildings. Although Western Building & Leasing initially relied primarily on external architects and contractors to construct their buildings, by 1927 Anhalt began to take a more direct role, despite having no formal training as an architect. Anhalt would often work late in his home office, sketching designs for a new project at his drafting table. The next morning, Anhalt would hand the sketches off to Seattle architect Mark Borchert, to his frequent collaborator, architect William Whitely, or to his own draftsmen Edwin Dofson and Bjarne Moe, for further refinement. In 1928, Anhalt bought out Hardcastle and founded Anhalt and Borchert, Designers and Builders, with Borchert. Anhalt apartments An Anhalt apartment courtyard. A growing interest in classic European architectural styles led Anhalt to begin sketching concepts for larger and more sophisticated apartment building designs, incorporating elements drawn from architectural pattern books such as Samuel Skidmore's Tudor Homes of England. Many of these new, multi-story buildings incorporated Tudor and Norman elements, such as turrets, stained- glass windows, and spiral staircases. Others drew on the Spanish Mission style in their use of clay roof tiles and faux-adobe stucco with ceramic inlays. In contrast with Anhalt's earlier bungalows, which were similar in style to other residential buildings of the period, the multi-story apartment buildings that Anhalt built during the late 1920s and early 1930s possess many custom touches, luxury amenities, and distinctive architectural features. These buildings were designed to provide members of the growing middle class with compelling alternatives to single family homes at a time when many central Seattle neighborhoods were becoming increasingly urbanized. Most Anhalt apartments, especially those he built in Seattle's Capitol Hill and Queen Anne neighborhoods such as Anhalt Arms (formerly Berkeley Court), feature landscaped interior courtyards. These courtyards, which are shaded and recessed from the street, provide a semi-private, outdoor common space for residents. Unlike many apartments built during the pre-war era, many Anhalt Apartments also possess both a front and a back door. The front door faced inwards, either onto a small alcove or landing shared with one to three other apartments, or directly onto the interior courtyard. These design decisions were intended to foster both a sense of privacy for individual tenants, and a sense of community within the building as a whole. Despite broad stylistic similarities, Anhalt apartments have been recognized for the degree to which each building is customized to its particular building site. The basic plan‚Äîindividual living spaces oriented around a common, open courtyard‚Äîmade it easier to make effective use of the natural light and existing vegetation on the building site. This floor plan also provided flexibility for minimizing street noise and maximizing privacy even in neighborhoods with high urban density. The interiors of Anhalt apartments feature amenities and design details that were uncommon in apartments of the time. Many Anhalt apartments featured built-in refrigerators, electric dish washers, wood-burning fireplaces, high ceilings, hand-carved woodwork, and double floors for soundproofing. Although individual apartments were not exceptionally large, many featured individualized floor plans and amenities more commonly found in single-family homes: upper and lower levels connected by curved interior staircases, private balconies, glazed tile work, and stained-glass window panes. The 25-unit Ten-O-Five apartment building, completed in 1930, was the first apartment building in Seattle to feature an underground parking garage. Lawrence Kreisman, in his booklet, Apartments by Anhalt, says: > \\"What made Anhalt's buildings succeed is not their particular style or size, > or complexity. It is the style of living encouraged therein -- the creation, > through design, of an enclosed community that, while it relates to the > street and neighborhood, also provides a common green, an outdoor living > room that is the sole province of the tenants.\\" Anhalt Apartments have been recognized both for their high build quality and for the speed with which they were constructed. Anhalt's company often completed construction of a building within fewer than three months, and usually constructed several buildings simultaneously. Anhalt achieved this balance through vertical integration and by taking advantages of efficiencies of scale‚Äîby centralizing design and construction within the same firm, and placing large orders with local suppliers of brick, tile and other building materials. Late career and legacy thumb Due to the rapid pace of construction and the increasing scale of his apartment projects, Anhalt found himself over-leveraged during the early years of the Great Depression, as demand for new middle-class housing waned. Unable to secure the capital necessary to pay his debts, the Anhalt Company declared bankruptcy in 1934. He continued to design smaller scale projects, including the original chapel at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, in Seattle's Laurelhurst neighborhood. He ultimately left the field in 1942 to open a Shur-Gro Nursery, which won a special award for landscape design from the Seattle chapter of the American Rhododendron Society in 1954. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Anhalt continued to occasionally provide landscape designs for various building projects in Seattle, including the Copenhagen (now Bonneville) apartments.

The central point of the plot of the anime is that the modern warship Mirai is transported back sixty years through time to 1942 on the eve of the Battle of Midway. The ship's weapons alone are enough to change the course of World War II, but equally potent are the advanced technology and knowledge of future events on board. The name of the ship is a homophone for the Japanese word meaning \\"future\\" and is often the basis of double entendres in the anime. The phrase \\"Mirai no nipponjin\\" („Åø„Çâ„ÅÑ„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫), often repeated in the anime, for example, can mean \\"Japanese people of the ship Mirai\\" or \\"Japanese people of the future.\\" Class description The Mirais aircraft hangar is visible in this aft view. The Mirai is a ship of a fictional Yukinami-class of helicopter defense destroyer, which was created specifically for the story. The fictional ships are essentially an improved version of the actual Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force . All these ships are equipped with the Aegis Combat System that provides the vessels possessing it the capability to locate, track and target a large number of enemy vessels, aircraft and even missiles at ranges and with accuracy that was unimaginable in World War II. The JDS Mirai is sometimes described as a cruiser rather than a destroyer. This is because a modern guided missile destroyer is about the size of a World War II light cruiser (the Mirai is actually longer than the and broader than the Takao-class heavy cruisers) and, in the context of the story, the WW II era characters misidentify the Mirai as a cruiser. Some sources have picked up this misidentification and reported it as factual.Anime News NetworkAnime source.Anime on DVD. =Variations between the Yukinami-class and the Kong≈ç- class= The major difference between the Yukinami-class and the Kong≈ç-class is that the fictional ship is ten meters longer, which provides space for an aircraft hangar on the aft part of the ship. Real destroyers of the Kong≈ç class have a helicopter landing pad on the fantail but do not carry any aircraft on board. The hangar on the Mirai allows her to carry a SH-60J Seahawk helicopter and a (fictional) VTOL armed reconnaissance aircraft, the tilt-wing MVSA-32J Umidori (Seagull). The availability of aircraft, especially the advanced capabilities of the VTOL Umidori, greatly expands the story lines by giving the characters mobility beyond the confines of the ship. =The Mirai and the Atago-class= The JMSDF has produced an improved Kong≈ç class which has a helicopter hangar but still does not carry helicopters on board. The first of the new destroyers, named Atago, was launched in 2005. The Atago- class design is approximately four meters longer and 500 tons heavier than that of the Kong≈ç class,DDG Atago (DDG 7,700 ton) Class, Global security. closely resembling the Mirai‚Äôs alterations. However, since the manga Zipang was published in 2000, at the same time as or even before JMSDF had added the improved Kong≈ç‚Äôs to their 5-year budget and years before the first keel was laid, it is unlikely that the Mirai was intended to be an Atago-class ship; the resemblance is more likely coincidence resulting from similar operational requirements. An improved \\"Flight IIA\\" version of the American Arleigh Burke- class also includes a slightly lengthened hull and a hangar for two Seahawk helicopters. Armament The Umidori with wings in forward flight mode. The Umidori with wings in hover mode. =Tomahawk missiles= In episode 22 of Zipang, the JDS Mirai uses a Tomahawk cruise missile to destroy the . The characters specifically identified this as the anti-ship variant and it is visually identical to the Tomahawk missile. In real-life, JMSDF ships do not carry Tomahawk cruise missiles, as Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution forbids Japan from possessing offensive weapons of any kind. The use of the Tomahawk cruise missile in the story suggests that in the near-future universe of the JDS Mirai, Japan had changed its policy on offensive weapons. The missile explodes on the deck of the Wasp and causes a massive chain reaction from the aircraft fuel and munitions of the second wave parked on the deck waiting to be launched, the Tomahawk sinks the Wasp with heavy casualties. =MVSA-32J Umidori= The MVSA-32J Umidori (English: Seagull) is a fictional aircraft created for the series. In it, it is a twin turboshaft engine, multi- mission Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force VTOL tilt-wing armed reconnaissance aircraft deployed aboard the destroyer Mirai. The MVSA-32J has two large, five-bladed propellers mounted on nacelles in its wings. The wings both tilt, for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), and fold, for storage within the Mirai‚Äôs hangar. It appears that its engines are not in the wing nacelles, which are too small and do not have any air intakes. Air intakes and engine exhausts in the lower part of the fuselage indicate that the engines are located there, presumably connected to the propellers by some complicated mechanical linkage. The design of the Umidori appears to be influenced by the Canadair CL-84 Tiltwing, which was intended for projected Sea Control Ships of the 1970s The modern design of the Umidori incorporates features of the Bell XV-15 in terms of aerodynamic form and size, and in turn of the later, larger V-22 Osprey. Early in the series the Umidori launches to verify that it was in fact 1942, where it flies over a Japanese base and is spotted. It is engaged by two floatplane fighters launched by the base, due to the officers stationed there (obviously) not recognizing the advanced VTOL aircraft. The Umidori pilots manage to disable the floatplanes without killing their operators and escape, but not before the Umidori gunner is struck and killed. *Top speed: *Armament: one 3-barreled 20mm \\"Gatling-style\\" cannon *Crew: 2, a pilot and a weapon systems operator (WSO) In the series, the Mirais crew refer to the aircraft as the \\"Seagull\\" but the characters from 1942 call it the \\"Umidori\\". =Deck gun= The main deck gun at the bow of the Mirai was enough to sink American convoy ships; however, it was never used for this purpose. When the Mirai stopped to resupply, the Japanese thought that the Mirai was not a powerful warship, they probably didn't know that the Mirai had missiles as well. The deck gun is a 127 mm compact gun, the standard of modern-day warships. In the episode when Hutton rams his Dauntless against the bridge his left wing, which separated on impact slammed against the deck gun barrel, thus damaging it. When an American Avenger torpedo bomber squadron attacked the Mirai, the deck gun destroyed the entire squadron, even though it was referred to as \\"one lousy gun\\". During their later resupply and repair at contemporary Yokosuka, the proper specifications of the original 127 mm were not followed, and thus the replacement barrel was limited to less power and a slower burst. The dire story continues and the new barrel is used in battle, against the bridges and towers of several American warships. =Sea Sparrow= The Mirai carries RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles, after a fleet of Japanese warships, led by the mighty Japanese battleship Yamato began heavy shelling of Guadalcanal, which was not to happen according to history, the Mirai launched Sea Sparrows to intercept the 18.1\\" rounds of Yamato. After intercepting numerous attempts to hit Guadalcanal the crew realized that they had a limited supply and Yamato had a whole magazine full of 18.1\\" rounds, and so they threatened to fire a missile at Yamato. When USS Wasp found the Mirai, the American carrier launched many aircraft to destroy the advanced warship. The Mirai fired off several missiles to destroy a fraction of the total to try and frighten away the remaining. However they only continued attacking the advanced ship which forced the Mirai to tear apart the first wave with her weapons. =CIWS= The Mirai is armed with several close-in weapon systems (CIWS); these were used several times during the story, one of these times was to tear apart and finally explode an American Douglas SBD Dauntless when its pilot attempted to ram his aircraft in an almost Kamikaze-style move (he bailed out at the last second). These were also used to explode a bomb, CIWS are computer controlled and ‚Äì according to the anime ‚Äì have what is called \\"double A Auto mode.\\" =ASROC= The Mirai uses ASROCs as an anti-submarine weapon; this was used at least once against what appears to be a Gato-class submarine sent to hunt down what the Americans thought was a damaged IJN cruiser, but was in fact a JMSDF guided-missile destroyer. One crewman in the CIC, who was obviously worried and scared by instinct launched the ASROC without clearance from Masayuki. By firing this weapon, the U.S. submarine discovered the Mirais most powerful weapon: the missile. But because Masayuki did not want to sink the submarine and kill its crew, he self-destructed the ASROC a few meters away from the sub.

The service, which supplied up to 14 days worth of listings data, was available through compatible digital terrestrial television receivers. The service was created by 4TV Limited, before the launch of Freeview's DVB seven-day EPG in 2004, and had been operated by Inview Technology since November 2006. 4TVInteractive was found on channel 300. Data was broadcast overnight (between 03:00 and 04:00) and stored by the receiver. Compatible receivers relied on this data rather than the \\"live\\" EPG broadcast on each multiplex. As a result, receivers dependent on 4TV data lack the ability to react to late schedule changes by broadcasters. During June 2010, InView Technology ceased updating the EPG and confirmed plans to terminate the service, with the final update providing EPG information until 7 July 2010. A representative said that the contract to distribute the updates had ended and therefore had no access to the necessary bandwidth to maintain the service. The companies involved were asked to maintain these services, but were unable to do so. However, they continued to offer advanced EPG information to Radio Times Extra EPG based devices. The list of affected boxes included: Digifusion FRT101, Digifusion FVRT100, Digifusion FVRT145, Digifusion FVRT150, Digifusion FVRT200, Digifusion FVRT400, Inverto IDL-7000T, Inverto IDL-7000M, Thomson DHD4000 and the Sony SVR-S500. No new devices using the 4TV EPG had shipped for four years prior to the services closure and none of the boxes were authorised to carry the Freeview label. Digifusion and Sony incorrectly featured the \\"Digital Tick\\", the Digital TV Group, which represents the digital TV industry, claims that these products were not entitled to carry the Digital Tick badge, and that they were 'self declared', the Digital TV Group has since tightened the licensing system and no longer allows self-certification. In July 2010, a petition calling on Freeview to help consumers left without the advance electronic programming guide (EPG) data had attracted over 760 signatures of consumers who didn't want to lose 4TV. In a statement, Freeview said that the situation demonstrates the need for consumers to always purchase Freeview products with Digital Tick. \\"We have contacted the third party involved to see if a solution can be found.\\" The Digital TV Group added: \\"Any product that carries the Digital Tick will have passed the Digital TV Group's rigorous test and conformance regimes. The failure of even a small number of ageing receivers in the market emphasises the need for all manufacturers to co- ordinate their production efforts through the specification and test and conformance procedures of the Digital TV Group to achieve the Digital Tick and Freeview trade mark licence, which are proven indicators that a product is compliant, reliable and robust.\\" On 2 August 2010, 4TVInteractive was removed from the Freeview EPG on channel 300. Viewers who retune the box will lose/remove the channel from the line-up. Old boxes which people doesn't use it anymore still have \\"4TVInteractive\\" on the channel list.

Since its launch on February 16, 2006, over 495,000 scores and 59,000 recordings for over 152,000 works by over 18,000 composers have been uploaded. Based on the wiki principle, the project uses MediaWiki software, with an iOS app released July 10, 2018 and an Android app released March 28, 2019. Since June 6, 2010, the IMSLP also includes public domain and licensed recordings in its scope, to allow for study by ear. History =Overview= The site was launched on February 16, 2006. The library consists mainly of scans of old musical editions out of copyright. In addition, it admits scores by contemporary composers who wish to share their music with the world by releasing it under a Creative Commons license. One of the main projects of the IMSLP was the sorting and uploading of the complete works of Johann Sebastian Bach in the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (1851‚Äì99), a task that was completed on November 3, 2008. Besides J.S. Bach's complete public domain works, all public domain works of Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, Joseph Canteloube, Emmanuel Chabrier, Ernest Chausson, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Joseph Haydn, Arcangelo Corelli, Claude Debussy, Vincent d'Indy, Paul Dukas, Gabriel Faur√©, Pierre- Octave Ferroud, George Frideric Handel, Jean Hur√©, Alb√©ric Magnard, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Maurice Ravel, Albert Roussel, Erik Satie, Florent Schmitt, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Alexander Scriabin and Jean Sibelius are available, as well as a large percentage of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Liszt, and the works of many others as well. Besides providing a digital repository, the IMSLP offers possibilities as a musicological encyclopaedia, since multiple and historical editions of a single composition can be uploaded. Also, pages on publishers provide valuable information, and the work pages themselves often contain a large quantity of information, e.g. roles in an opera. IMSLP is recommended as a research tool by MIT, which also uses it extensively for providing scores for its OpenCourseWare courses. It is suggested as a resource by the Sibley Music Library and by libraries at other universities such as Stanford University, University of California, Los Angeles, Brown University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Manhattan School of Music University of Maryland, University of Washington, University of Cincinnati, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, Appalachian State University in the US, McGill University in Canada, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, University of Edinburgh University of Bristol in the UK, University of Melbourne in Australia, and others. In 2019, IMSLP and TwoSetViolin collaborated to make a TwoSetViolin x IMSLP merchandise lineup. = Logo = IMSLP logo (2007‚Äì2015) The blue letter featured in Petrucci Music Library logo, used in 2007‚Äì2015, was based on the first printed book of music, the Harmonice Musices Odhecaton, published by Ottaviano Petrucci in 1501. In 2007‚Äì2015, the IMSLP / Petrucci Music Library used a logo based on a score. The score image in the background was taken from the beginning of the very first printed book of music, the Harmonice Musices Odhecaton. It was published in Venice, Italy in 1501 by Ottaviano Petrucci, the library's namesake. In 2016, the IMSLP changed its logo to a clean wordmark, featuring its two project names--IMSLP and Petrucci Music Library. =Awards= In 2009, the IMSLP won the MERLOT Classics award for Music. It was named one of the Top 100 Web Sites of 2009 (in the \\"Undiscovered\\" subsection) by PC Magazine. In 2018, Edward Guo was honored with The Helen Rice Award by the Associated Chamber Music Players (ACMP) Foundation in recognition of those who have moved the chamber music world in a new directions. =Closure and reopening= On October 19, 2007, the IMSLP closed following legal demands from Universal Edition of Vienna, Austria. The cease and desist letter expressed concern that some works that are in public domain in the server's location in Canada with copyright protection of 50 years following death, but are protected by the 70 years following death term in some other countries, were available in those countries. The administrator of the website, Edward W. Guo, also known under the nickname Feldmahler, decided to close down the repository, but left the forums online so that discussions into the best way to proceed could be made: In response, director Michael S. Hart of Project Gutenberg offered support to keep the project online. This offer was declined by Guo, who voiced concern about having the project hosted in the United States, and consulted the Canadian wing of Project Gutenberg. On November 2, 2007, Michael Geist, a prominent Canadian copyright academic, wrote an article for the BBC discussing the specifics and the wider implications of this case. IMSLP went back online on June 30, 2008. Since its reopening, the site has been using a strict copyright policy wherein uploaded files are made accessible for download only after the copyright status for three most frequent copyright regimes has been reviewed by staff members. Although the server is located in Canada, files that are not public domain in the US were until July 2010 flagged [TB], for 'Technical Block' or 'Temporary Block', and could not be viewed. The FAQ posted in their forum stated, \\"Unfortunately, these 'temporary' blocks will be until further notice ‚Äì possibly all the way until the expiration of term in the USA.\\" After an initial phase, [TB] flagged items have essentially disappeared thanks to the introduction of regional servers operated by unaffiliated organizations (see next). On 21 April 2011, the Music Publishers Association (UK) issued a DMCA takedown notice against the IMSLP. Go Daddy, the domain name registrar for the IMSLP, removed the domain name \\"imslp.org\\", leaving it inaccessible. The MPA's argument was similar to that made in 2007 by Universal Edition. In particular, the MPA claimed that Rachmaninoff's 1913 choral symphony The Bells violated US and EU copyright.Text of the MPA's letter to Go Daddy According to the IMSLP, the action is without any merit.\\"IMSLP Under Attack\\" by Carolus, IMSLP Forum (21 April 2011) Almost 24 hours later, the MPA (UK) announced on Twitter that they had asked Go Daddy to reinstate the domain name.Tweet by Will Lines, Music Publishers Association (UK) (22 April 2011) On November 7, 2017, the IMSLP received a cease and desist letter from the heirs of Sergei Prokofiev expressing concern that the composer's music was available for download in countries where his music was still under copyright protection. This demand was followed up by a separate letter from the National Music Publishers Association on January 19, 2018. On February 23, 2018, access to all compositions by Prokofiev was blocked by the IMSLP in response to these legal threats. The issues were partially resolved on the IMSLP forums in July 2018, resulting in the reupload of Prokofiev's pre-1923 works. In August, the remainder of Prokofiev's works were reuploaded so that they would only be available in the countries they are allowed in. =Subscription introduction= On December 27, 2015, the IMSLP moved to a subscription-based model, where users are expected to pay to avoid a waiting period on some of the files available on the site, and to access certain newly uploaded files. Users who have not paid are subject to a 15-second waiting period on certain files (excluding Creative Commons-licensed files that constitute a majority of the site's files), are required to wait up to two days to access newly uploaded files, and are shown advertising. The project leader Edward Guo claimed the changes were made because the level of funding was \\"not sustainable in the long run\\", but also noted: : \\"The income we receive from various sources have been enough to maintain the site so far, but I increasingly believe that this level of funding is not sustainable in the long run. We are not, like traditional music libraries, bound by the service of a conservatory, university or publisher, but rather can do things that traditional institutions are not willing to do, because we serve only musicians and music lovers. But everything is a tradeoff ‚Äì we also do not have the funding infrastructure these traditional institutions have, and over the past few years I‚Äôve frankly exhausted my imagination in searching for new realistic sources of funding for IMSLP. : \\"And so I will announce here that a subscription system for IMSLP will be put in place. But this will not be a traditional subscription model ‚Äì in particular, no file will be blocked from access by the public. Rather, a subscription will permit a member to download files without having to wait a certain number of seconds, eliminiate [sic] some of the advertising on the site, and a few other benefits. I see this as a way to both preserve IMSLP‚Äôs philosophy of open access and to secure IMSLP‚Äôs future.\\" Guo attributed the change in funding to discussions with librarians at an IAML conference in June 2015. Some contributors to the website expressed concerns that Guo had not properly attempted to raise donations, but without any prior warning, introduced the membership system to monetize their work. =Naxos Music Library= On April 18, 2016, the IMSLP announced on its Twitter account that all subscribers will have access to the Naxos Music Library. =EU server= On July 10, 2010, a forum thread announced the opening of a new server located in the Netherlands. This server allows works that are public domain in Canada and the EU to be downloaded legally, even if they are under copyright in the US. The server was initially run by an unaffiliated European organization, while a forum thread later announced that operations had been handed over to Project Leonardo, a new unaffiliated company incorporated in New Zealand to \\"provide web hosting services to online libraries that distribute free contents in any fields of arts and science\\". Files on the EU server are flagged (EU). =US server= A similar, also unaffiliated, US server allows users to download works that are in the public domain only in the US. Unlike the other servers, this one can only be contributed to by administrators and users who have asked for the privilege, though the files are freely accessible for download. =CA server= On July 1, 2013, a forum thread announced the opening of a new server located in Canada and operated by Project Leonardo, the unaffiliated company that also runs the EU server. This server is especially intended for users located in countries where copyright lasts 50 years from the death of the author, such as Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and many others. Files on the CA server are flagged (CA). =WIMA merge= On August 23, 2011, an announcement was made that the Werner Icking Music Archive would merge with the IMSLP. WIMA had announced the merge on its own site five days before in an open letter to contributors. After working out some technical issues, the IMSLP decided to officially commence the merge on August 28. The merge was announced to be complete on July 21, 2012. =Current legal structure= IMSLP is now owned by Project Petrucci LLC, a private company created to run the website. Project Petrucci LLC was registered as a Delaware limited-liability company on June 28, 2008, when the site founder was studying at the New England Conservatory. The website provides an e-mail address for the site's founder (\\"preferred\\"), and a physical address for the company's registered agent in the United States (for \\"any legal or formal correspondence\\"). Project Leonardo is an internet service provider that hosts free online content in the arts or sciences.

A number of characteristics allows the differentiation of each species in the genus. Sorubim species are important food fish in South America and are highly significant to fisheries of some areas; however, harvests of these fish are not identified as much as other, more popular food fishes such as Colossoma, Arapaima, and Brachyplatystoma. Some species of this family are popular aquarium fish. Taxonomy The genus name is derived from a Brazilian local name, sorub√≠.Littman, M.W. (2007): page 4 The description of Sorubim has been attributed to both Cuvier and Agassiz in 1829, but because Cuvier's description predates that of Agassiz by two months, Cuvier's is valid. Later, Sorubim lima, originally described as Siluris lima in 1801, was designated as the type species by Bleeker in 1862.Littman, M.W. (2007): page 2 In 2007, this genus was reviewed, validating five species.Littman, M.W. (2007): page 8 S. lima and S. trigonocephalus are redescribed in this paper. This genus is monophyletic. Species The currently recognized species in this genus are: * Sorubim cuspicaudus Littmann, Burr & Nass, 2000 (trans-Andean shovelnose catfish) * Sorubim elongatus Littmann, Burr, Schmidt & Isern, 2001 (slender shovelnose catfish) * Sorubim lima (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) (duckbill catfish) * Sorubim maniradii Littmann, Burr & Buitrago-Su√°rez, 2001 * Sorubim trigonocephalus Miranda-Ribeiro, 1920 (arrowhead shovelnose catfish) Distribution and habitat Sorubim is a widely distributed genus, collected from many major river basins in 10 countries.Littman, M.W. (2007): page 1 S. lima is the most widely distributed species of the genus, found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, Paran√°, and Parna√≠ba basins. Initially it did not occur in the upper Paran√° basin above the Gua√≠ra Falls, but these disappeared after the construction of the Itaipu Dam, allowing this species (and several others) to spread.J√∫lio J√∫nior, Dei T√≥s, Agostinho, and Pavanelli (2009). A massive invasion of fish species after eliminating a natural barrier in the upper rio Paran√° basin. Neotropical Ichthyology 7(4): 709‚Äì18. It is syntopic with S. elongatus in the Orinoco basin and with S. elongatus and S. maniradii in the upper Amazon drainage of Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. S. maniradii was discovered in the Napo and Yasuni River drainages of Ecuador, but also occurs in other tributaries of the Amazon. S. elongatus is found in the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo River basins. S. cuspicaudus is found in northern Colombia and inhabits Lake Maracaibo, Sinu River, Cauca River, and Magdalena River basins. S. trigonocephalus was initially considered very rare as only three specimens were known by 2007. Later many more specimens have been collected and the species is relatively common. It is found only in the Tapaj√≥s and Xingu basins in Brazil. The type locality of S. trigonocephalus has been reported as the Madeira River, but the species does not occur there and the correct locality is now recognized to be the Arinos River, a part of the Tapaj√≥s basin. Sorubim species are found in fast-moving and slow-moving waters, including lakes, rivers, and bays. Typically, the substrate is either sand, clay, or mud, associated with reeds, grasses, and roots. They are not found as often over substrates of strictly sand or mud. They are also not found as commonly in clearer blackwater habitats. S. elongatus occurs in both whitewater and blackwater, found in floodplain lakes and small creeks to large rivers. S. lima is commonly found in schools. Anatomy and appearance Sorubim species, like other catfish, possess dorsal and pectoral fin spines. They have a triangular adipose fin. As Pimelodidae, these fish have very long barbels, especially maxillary barbels, which range in length from reaching the pectoral fin to extending past the pelvic fins.Littman, M.W. (2007): page 3 Like some other pimelodid genera, these fish may have long filaments on their dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins; in juveniles, these filaments may be even longer than the body. Sorubim is characterized by a shovel-like, projecting upper jaw with an exposed, villiform (brush-like) premaxillary tooth patch. The head is depressed and usually three times longer than it is wide. The eyes are set laterally and usually visible from below. They have a characteristic black, lateral stripe, variable in width, that extends from the snout to the end of the caudal fin; though this may seem minor, no other pimelodid has a lateral stripe that reaches down the entire length of the head and body. Along with the lateral stripe, Sorubim species have a darkened dorsal surface, which is sometimes separated by a thinner, lighter-colored band. The dorsal surface may change its shade quickly with its surroundings. S. lima may also display dark blotches or spots on its dorsal surface. The ventral part of the body is white or cream-colored. Light areas may appear golden or slate gray, often appearing iridescent. Young fish are more heavily pigmented than adults. Posterior-most rays on dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins are elongated, darker, and heavily speckled with chromatophores; however, this speckling is reduced in the adults. This could provide camouflage when the fish are young and hiding among plant materials, and is lost when the adults live in more open water habitats. S. lima appears similar to S. trigonocephalus; however, the latter has a long snout, pointed (triangular) head, and an exposed patch of premaxillary teeth that is as wide as it is long. S. cuspicaudus has a markedly different tail (straight, pointed, and long) in contrast to the other Sorubim with more rounded caudal fin lobes. S. maniradii is differentiated from the other species by a high number of gill rakers, ranging from 31‚Äì37, compared to the 13‚Äì23 of the other Sorubim species, as well as a more diffused lateral stripe. S. elongatus has an elongated head and body, and appears rather slender in comparison to the other members of this genus. S. cuspicaudus is the largest species in the genus, reaching up to in standard length. S. trigonocephalus and S. lima reach a length of almost . By contrast, S. elongatus and S. maniradii only reach about half that length, about in the former and in the latter. Ecology Because of the natural whitewater habitats of these fish, which makes natural observation difficult, most observations of the behavior of this fish is largely known from study of fish in aquaria. Natural history and reproduction of this fish are not well known. When inactive, these fish often swim in a vertical posture, probably to help blend into stems of reeds and other aquatic plants; when active, they swim in a normal, horizontal manner. They may use this camouflage either to hide from predators or as part of ambush predation. These fish feed on fish and crustaceans, and as adults are largely piscivorous. Sorubim species have been observed in captivity to excavate a small pit as a nest and even to guard freshly hatched young (unfortunately, none of these young survived). These fish are nocturnal and occur in groups or schools. In the aquarium S. lima has been in the aquarium trade for many years, and is the most common species found in the aquarium trade. S. elongatus also appears rather often, and is sold as S. lima. This fish is lazy and slow-moving; being nocturnal, it will usually hide during the day. It will accept most food, but also can consume smaller fish. It is hardy, and the pH is not of great importance, but slightly acidic is best. This fish requires a large aquarium. This fish prefers a current as well as clean water. It has not yet been bred in captivity.

It is located in Ranco Province in Los R√≠os Region. Lago Ranco takes its name from Ranco Lake, which it shares with the commune of Futrono.  History  Ranco Lake Basin was inhabited since ancient times by indigenous people belonging to Huilliche \\"people of the south\\", which was characterized by a more peaceful than that of the Mapuche. Although this was not the norm, as demonstrated in the great rebellion led by toqui Pelantaru in 1599 and that meant the destruction and abandonment of cities and fountains built by the Spanish conquistadors south of the B√≠o-B√≠o. But most of the life of the Huilliche communities in the area, spent a relatively quiet in close contact with the natural environment that gave them their livelihood: the gathering, hunting, fishing, livestock and incipient agriculture, were the activities that allowed him to maintain their sedentary lifestyle and the development of certain cultural expressions. During the colonial period this picture changed little, remaining outside the territories of the colonization process, only rarely are noticed some attempts to integrate this area to civilized life, for example, through missionary work of the Jesuits from the fortifications of Quinchilca in the north, and San Jos√© de Alcudia, on the south, on the banks of the river Well, west of the lake. The geographical setting in which they lived Huilliches communities in our area were Maihue lacustrine basins and Ranco, both lakes located in the pre-Andean area and connected by the river Calcurrupe. In this geographical setting that had its genesis in the last glacial period, the Quaternary-lived the early inhabitants of this place, and each sector was taking a name that identifies you to present: Maihue, Curri√±e, Chabranco, hueinahue and Rupumeica, Cars in Maihue sector. TRINGL, Ranco, Huapi, Calcurrupe, Llif√©n, Illahuapi, Pocuro, Ri√±inahue, Pitre√±o, Ilihue, Quillaico, Ignatieff, Pitriuco in the area of Lago Ranco. During the Republican era in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Chilean state must promote a process of settlement and integration of their individual territories, the national life. But its location in the pre- Andean sector the Lake Ranco was not an objective considered in this process whose attention was focused on the longitudinal valley and the coastal sector. Still, in 1846 the cartographer Bernardo Phillippi, drew up a map of the province of Valdivia, made at the time by the departments of Valdivia and Osorno. Another nineteenth-century historical record indicates that in 1885 the Department of Valdivia was divided into sub-delegations and districts, such as sub No. 8 of Quinchilca was established, which included the districts of Quinchilca, Ri√±ihue and Maihue. The latter is the land area basis for future community of Lago Ranco. The first colonists who settled on the banks of Lake Ranco, arrived from the late nineteenth century, which motivated his adventurous spirit took up residence in the western sector of the Lake, in the areas of Hueimen and Ignatieff, natural beauty and the immense wealth of native forests was a major reason why families continue to arrive by German colonists, who formed the vanguard of settlement in this place and encouraged the integration with the central valley. Among these early families were Konust, Daniel and Rettig, whose descendants still develop the entrepreneurial spirit of their ancestors. On the other hand, you should also mention other families from these places whose descendants represents the link with the ancestral past. These families may include: Ancacura, Huaito, Huenuman, Quichel, NEIP, Antilaf, Calfulef, Millape, Curinao, Calfumil, Catrihual and others, which are an example of the historical heritage of the ancestors Huilliches.  Gesta Railroad  The construction of a railway between Cocula (southern sector of La Union) and Lago Ranco began in 1928, this project was initiated by the first settlers: Konust, Daniel and Rettig, who, with business vision prompted this action. The branch was completed in the 1930s, was at first only to Ignatieff, while difficult to solve the section called \\"Return of the Guitar\\", at the height of Quillaico. Once the railway lines in its path, began a slow settling of population engaged in preference to the work resulting from logging, which was the main economic activity of the time and the main objective of the railway. So in the first instance, this town received the name of Punta de Rails, later by expansion into the hills, was renamed P√©rez Rosales TRINGL and then drive in honor of German colonization in the area. In 1935 he prepared the first master plan for this fledgling town. In 1937 by Decree ordered the auction of public lands into subdivisions, which later gave rise to the town. On February 14, 1941, under the government of Pedro Aguirre Cerda, Lagoe Ranco, was formally granted the status of a commune. Decree Law No. 6826 carried and article No. 1 stated: \\"Believe the commune sub-delegation of Lake Ranco, Department of Rio Bueno. His head is the village of Ranco Lake, located south of Lake Ranco.\\" The respective decree also sets the limits of the new community and set the procedure for holding elections to form the new municipality. With the creation of the commune in 1941, begins to intensify the slow process of urbanization and community development; since then has been unfolding is communal life with the push of its authorities and citizens and with the support of central governments, as This has led to greater integration with neighboring communities, particularly the town of Rio Bueno. Significant activity is to highlight the lake in 1947 and recorded a great climax. Several steamers plied the waters of Lake Ranco, covering different areas in a large area stretching from Puerto Rettig, and the same Ranco, until Ri√±inahue, Llif√©n, Futrono, Isla Huapi and Puerto Nuevo. A whole era marked vapors as the Laja, the Saturn, Osorno, Lili, the Valdivia, going back and bringing people and goods on the waters of Ranco, rarely troubled by the puihua. Several of them were destroyed by the force of black puelche. One of the major works undertaken in the commune, has been the building of the Liceo Antonio Varas, \\"which concluded in 1960, the stock of education certainly has become a cornerstone of the municipality's development in educational level, social and cultural. The force of nature, through their violent demonstrations has not been absent during the twentieth century are remembered two major natural disasters: the eruption of Cars in 1955 and the 1960 earthquake, which caused concern and damage, then overcome. Another important milestone in the history community, were determined by the regionalization process driven from 1974, which established the autonomy of the town of Lake Ranco, but also meant segregated Llif√©n eastern sector, which was integrated into the Futrono commune. Demographics Zone of the Lago Ranco comune According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Lago Ranco spans an area of and has 10,098 inhabitants (5,295 men and 4,803 women). Of these, 2,205 (21.8%) lived in urban areas and 7,893 (78.2%) in rural areas. The population fell by 3.5% (362 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.  Hydrography  The community of Lake Ranco has numerous streams, which belong to the Andean sector of the watershed of the Rio Bueno, Andean valley with 17 210 km ¬≤ with a distance of 130 km east-west. The river Well get as many tributaries from the south bank by presenting a high rainfall regime and shows characteristics rushing mountain range with nival.1 The river system is good natural drainage of Lake Ranco which is 443 km ¬≤ to 69 m and 199 m maximum depth, characterized by being the second largest lake in area within the territory of Lake Ranco nacional.1 fall in water from Lake Maihue with an area of 49 km ¬≤ and Huishue, which lie north of Caulle cord. Also drains into Lake Ranco Ri√±inahue River, which rises near the Nevada Mountains, close to the limits of the National Park Puyehue. Buttress Rivers, Deer and Nilahue born north of Puyehue volcano, draining the central sector of the volcanic zone Puyehue - Carr, both rivers join near the volcano Carran, taking the name of Nilahue River, which flows to the east of Lake Ranco. In the area of the Cordillera Nevada, born Iculpe River, which empties into the southern shore of Lake Ranco, near the village of Lake Ranco. Gray Lake is located in the southwest of the town of Lake Ranco and within the Puyehue National Park, with an approximate area of 9 km ¬≤ and 1,000 meters. The lake gives rise to the White River, which joins the river Chol Chol, the latter being born of the lagoon Twins. These rivers flow into Lake Huishue. Also flows into the lake the stream the Virgin, who was born northwest of Lake Gris.  Weather  Three types of very different climates can be found in Lago Ranco: the so-called rainy temperate climate with Mediterranean influence (Cfsb) mountain weather (G) and icy climate by the effect of height (EFH). The first type of climate is developed between the Cordillera Pre - Andean Middle surrounding the Depression. Not to be characterized by a dry season rainfall occurring throughout the year, presenting however some features of a break during the warm season rainfall. In this temperate rainforest does not have large temperature swings. This is facilitated by the liquid surface of Lake Ranco, moreover, prevents frost on its banks. During the spring and summer there is a persistent cloudiness that tends to dissipate by noon, which is known as South negro.3 The mountain climate is evident in the Andes, in some sectors of the foothills. It is above curve at 500 m, height corresponding approximately to the development of 5 ¬∞C isotherm in the coldest month and even that disappears where tree-like vegetation, the effect of low temperatures. The third type of weather that occurs in the town of Lake Ranco is the icy climate by the effect of height, which takes place in high mountain areas, where the elevation exceeds 3,000 m, the conditions in such sectors are broken between a climate of tundra, no trees, to a climate of perpetual snow without vegetation with increasing altitude. The community of Lake Ranco is characterized by rainfall throughout the year. The average annual rainfall reaches Lake Ranco 2020 mm, while in the lake Maihue is 4072 mm. This shows that precipitation increases as height increases, resulting in increased rainfall in the commune in its eastern sector. In the commune averages temperatures descend towards the east, however there are large areas close to the lake where temperatures are conditioned by the thermal moderating effect. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures are recorded annually in the months of January and July. Lago Ranco temperature for between 3 and 20 ¬∞C and the lake Maihue between 0 and 18 ¬∞C. The municipality has no dry months, but the most affected by this natural phenomenon are the months of February for Lake Ranco and December for the lake Maihue. In the town of Lake Ranco winds prevail northwest, southwest and west. Along with that winds are typical, as the Puigua or Puelche over all the commune, which dry the air in the summer and cause storms at invierno. The fauna is closely related to the vegetation existing in the area, called Valdivian rainforest, which is characterized by the high proportion of endemic species, i.e. species whose distribution area is bounded in this region. However, many of these species are in danger of extinction due to man's unconsciousness. The most common mammals in these forests are the winks, pud√∫ whose preferred habitat is the forest and ulmo coihue, puma the south, living in the mountain range, the gray fox, the coypu in the south, which is located in wetlands and swamps, and wild cat, and other introduced species like the hare. With regard to birds, it highlights the Chucao, the Huet hued, the Pigeon, the Choroy, the Carpenter and Partridge Grande Southern, among others. Among insects, highlights: the Stag Beetle, the Beetle of the Moon, the Mother of the Snake and Horse of the Devil. As the fish are native and introduced species, which are a major attraction for sport fishing. The most abundant native fish are puye, carmetita, percatrucha zebra trout, mackerel of the river, and among the introduced species are rainbow trout, brook trout, brown trout and trout in Europe. Administration As a commune, Lago Ranco is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Santiago Rosas Lobos (PDC). He was preceded by Santiago Rosas Lobos (2004‚Äì2008) Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Lago Ranco is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Enrique Jaramillo (PDC) and Gast√≥n Von M√ºhlenbrock (UDI) as part of the 54th electoral district, (together with Pangipulli, Los Lagos, Futrono, R√≠o Bueno, La Uni√≥n and Paillaco). The commune is represented in the Senate by Andr√©s Allamand (RN) and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (PDC) as part of the 16th senatorial constituency (Los R√≠os Region).  Business  The primary economic activities in Lago Ranco are agriculture and forestry, tourism, and services. With regard to agriculture and forestry sector, according to an agroclimatic study conducted in the district, much of it does not have a good potential for agricultural activities, except the Lake Ranco. Moreover, the climate allows all crops from the area except where the soil constraints only accept natural grasslands. In the commune dominated by mountainous terrain and only about 4.2% are suitable for agriculture. According to the agroclimatic diagnosis made, Lago Ranco has a potential forest predominantly due to agro-ecological characteristics of the soil and the existence of abundant reserve of native forests and young plantations of exotic species, the activity is performed at a level primary operation and is characterized by an extraction process without processing timber for other more technology centers. On a smaller scale, is the livestock and agricultural sector, which belongs to smallholder farmers who use a minimal operating system, with limited technology and geared specifically to the cultivation of traditional items such as wheat and potatoes, which is normally used for consumption, with family labor, so integrated into fewer medium-sized farmers, who use more manpower and more technology. Besides the activities described above, the town of Lake Ranco has a potential for tourism and increased economic activity within this sector, since the community is within the Lake Ranco, which is part of the Andean Lake Tourist Zone, which is constituted as a tourist area in the process of consolidation by the Tourism Development Master Plan of the Lake District, this coupled with the great beauty that has next to its natural attractions, plus the history and cultural identity that has the commune. It also established as part of the destination \\"Cuenca del Lago Ranco,\\" in conjunction with the municipalities of Rio Bueno, Paillaco, Futrono and La Union.

The Barn Hill Conservation Group maintain the Roe Green walled garden that is within the park. Roe Green Village was built between 1918 and 1920, using Prussian/German prisoners of war as cheap labour after World War I. The park was incorporated and thus taken under council control between 1935 and 1938.  History  The basketball court in the background located in Roe Green Park in 2008 This now much used park in Kingsbury came about because of the rapid growth of suburban housing in this part of the district in the early 1930s. In 1933 the local Council identified a site on the north side of Kingsbury Road for a park, but this was subject to plans for housing (Manor Close) by the developer, George Cloke.1 Kingsbury UDC minutes, Vol. 6 (1929‚Äì34) at Brent Archives. He had moved into Kingsbury Manor in 1929, and bought most of the land of Valley Farm the following year. Under pressure from the local Ratepayers' Association, the Council negotiated with Mr Cloke to purchase some of his other land for a park, and in March 1935 two fields on the south side of Bacon Lane (about 21 acres) were bought for about ¬£27,000, with Middlesex County Council contributing 25% of the money. As the entrance to this new park was from Roe Green, it was given the name \\"Roe Green Park\\". While the purchase was going through, Wembley Urban District Council decided to use part of the park fronting Kingsbury Road as the site for an open air swimming pool. In 1936 and 1937 Roe Green Park was used as the venue for a week-long Carnival and Fete to raise money for Wembley Hospital (which was run by a charity in these days before the National Health Service) and also for brass band concerts on summer Sunday evenings, but these events were transferred to Silver Jubilee Park when work started on building Kingsbury Swimming Pool in 1938. The Olympic-sized pool opened in May 1939. After buying the two fields, the Council wanted to acquire further land, to make the park more accessible from the main shopping centre and Kingsbury Station. After three years of negotiations, they bought the Westcroft field for ¬£13,750 from another local developer, Henry Higinbotham, in 1938. In the same year, Kingsbury Manor and its grounds were purchased from George Cloke. This was a joint purchase with Middlesex County Council, who wanted to use the large, secluded house as a Maternity Hostel for unmarried mothers. The land for the park as it now exists had been acquired, but soon the outbreak of the Second World War meant that all of the park was ploughed up to provide allotments where local people could grow vegetables and fruit. After the war, twenty \\"pre-fab\\" bungalows were built along the Kingsbury Road edge of the park between the swimming pool and the Kingsbury Manor lodge, as emergency housing for families, and it was only around 1960 that local residents could enjoy the use of all of the park again.2 Grant, Philip (2008) \\"The Story of Kingsbury Road, and Old Kenton Lane\\", unpublished work available at Brent Archives and Kingsbury Library Plus. =John Logie Baird= John Logie Baird, the television pioneer, leased the former stables and coach house at Kingsbury Manor in 1928.

The following year, the first combined sound and vision signals were received.3 Curley, Councillor M.J., (July 1953), \\"John Logie Baird\\", Wembley History Society Journal, Vol. 1 No. 4 For many years afterwards the former stables were known as Kingsbury Manor Studio, and are now the home of Kingsbury Veterans' Club.

A plaque to commemorate Baird's work here was unveiled next to this by Wembley History Society in the 1950s, which was moved to the Veterans' Club after damage by vandals.4 Grant, Philip (2008) \\"The Story of Kingsbury Road, and Old Kenton Lane\\", unpublished work available at Brent Archives and Kingsbury Library Plus. =Homicide= The park was in the news headlines in February 2002 when the fire-blistered body of an 18-year-old Sri Lankan man was found there.

History The company was founded in 1946 in Ward, Colorado, by Gerald \\"Gerry\\" Cunningham, a veteran of the 10th Mountain Division. Initially it was a mail order business providing lightweight equipment for mountaineers. In 1950, Cunningham developed the triangular carabiner, the first in the modern style. Less than five years later, he also invented the drawstring clamp also known as a cord clamp or cord lock. In 1953, Gerry tents were used in the first successful Everest expedition. In 1958, Gerry opened the first of its retail stores, in Boulder. In 1949 Cunningham invented the Gerry Kiddie Carrier which was frameless; the frame version was patented in 1963. The company Gerry Designs, Inc. was spun off with Meg Hansson in 1960 to market the carrier to a wider audience. Nearly a million babies were toted in the carriers. In 1959, the company created a very compact survival suit for the US Air Force. The seven piece suit was made of nylon and goose down and came vacuum packed in a small box. It was used in jets and space capsules. The coat converted into a sleeping bag. Gerry expanded into outerwear and produced some of the first lightweight down jackets. In 1963, the company supplied ultra lightweight gear for the first American ascent of Mount Everest. For the 1964 Winter Olympics the Olympic Committee wore Gerry ski coats. In 1966, Gerry alumnus Dale Johnson founded Frostline Kits, a brand of sew-it-yourself outdoor products. In 1971, Cunningham resigned from the company, saying it was \\"too big and no fun\\". In 1973 he was elected to the Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame. At that time Gerry was a division of Outdoor Sports Industries. Through 1980, the company offered a collection of innovative and brightly colored down garments, which sold well worldwide. But within a few years the company's products largely disappeared from the retail market. Later, the Gerry brand was owned by the Amerex Group Inc., a New York-based privately owned clothing manufacturer which owned several brands. In 2002, Amerex created the Gerry website and announced a number of sponsorship programs. Cunningham died May 15, 2010 at his home in Patagonia, Arizona (born February 17, 1922). In 2010, the Gerry brand was bought by Studio Ray, of New York City which revamped the catalog, which included their classic outerwear and accessories. In Fall 2012, Gerry began to be sold at retailers, including Macy's, Dillard's, and The Sports Authority. Their lightweight jackets are also sold seasonally in Costco stores. Gerry has its showroom in New York City.

It was developed in the 1960s and early 1970s on a plateau to the north of the Bow River valley, and is primarily composed of Single-detached dwellings on wide lots. The neighbourhood comprises three major areas: Varsity Acres, Varsity Village, and Varsity Estates. Varsity is bounded on the north and east by Crowchild Trail, on the west by the Bow River, and on the south by 32nd Avenue NW. It borders the neighbourhoods of Silver Springs and Bowness on the west side, and both Montgomery and the University of Calgary campus on the south side. The easternmost portion of Varsity contains the University of Calgary Research Park. Developments =Varsity Acres= Varsity Acres is the oldest part of Varsity. It was developed in the 1960s with a street pattern of folded grids, rear lanes, and the occasional cul-de-sac. The original access from the east was via Varsity Drive where it intersected at Crowchild Trail at Brisebois Drive. This access was closed in the early 1970s in favour of a connection to 40th Avenue NW at the same intersection. =Varsity Village= Varsity Village was developed by Carma Developers LP in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Unique in Calgary, the planning of Varsity Village was based on the Radburn Plan by Clarence Stein and Henry Wright. The Radburn Plan adapted the ideas of the English Garden City to the increasingly motorised American context, developing a street hierarchy that segregated through traffic from local traffic and automotive traffic from pedestrian traffic. Like at Radburn, the developers of Varsity Village used as many culs- de-sac as possible, and forwent rear lanes in favour of pedestrian pathways that connected to parks behind the houses (and not adjacent to streets). The developers' intent was to create a park-like setting for users of the rear walkways, and in many places in the neighbourhood where tall private fences have not been built, this intent has been maintained. This pattern of development was also used in Calgary in the neighbourhood of Braeside. Market Mall, one of Calgary's major regional interior malls is located in Varsity Village, along with most of the neighbourhood's multi-family dwellings. =Varsity Estates= Varsity Estates is Varsity's most upscale area. It is almost entirely made up of single-detached dwellings without rear lanes, and much of it lies adjacent to the Bowmont Natural Park or the Silver Springs Golf and Country Club. Given that the C-Train has been extended to Varsity adjacent to Varsity Estates, the City has proposed a transit-oriented development in the area.Varsity Proposed Land Use Study (PDF) Demographics In the City of Calgary's 2012 municipal census, Varsity had a population of living in dwellings, a 1.5% increase from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2012. Residents in this community had a median household income of $58,603 in 2000, and there were 15.1% low income residents living in the neighbourhood. As of 2000, 23% of the residents were immigrants. A proportion of 32.9% of the buildings were condominiums or apartments, and 31% of the housing was used for renting. Education The community is served by F. E. Osborne Junior High School, Jerry Potts Elementary School, Marion Carson Elementary and Varsity Acres Bilingual Elementary public schools, as well a by St. Vincent de Paul Elementary & Junior High (Catholic).

He was recently portrayed by Grayson McCouch from February 18, 2003 to January 18, 2008. McCouch returned to the role on September 24, 2008. Character history Born Dustin Donovan, he was the son of Nicole Berryesa Donovan and her lover Gunnar St. Clair but was legally raised by Burke Donovan when Nicole died giving birth to him. He befriended Paul Stenbeck, and a discovery about their family was made. Paul's father and Dusty's father were switched at birth, making Dusty's father and Dusty himself the rich heir of the Stenbecks. In 1983, a rebellious teen, Dusty arrived in Oakdale with his stepfather, horse trainer Burke Donovan. He quickly became involved with Lily Snyder, daughter of rich and wealthy Lucinda Walsh. John Dixon became Dusty's guardian and mentor. Though Lucinda wasn't thrilled with this relationship, she preferred Dusty over the new stableboy, Holden Snyder, who also had a crush on Lily. Lily was stuck between both boys but eventually lost her virginity to Dusty. Around the time Holden was trying to win over Lily, Dusty slept with Meg Snyder, who afterward pretended to be pregnant by him to cut him loose from Lily. When Dusty found out Meg lied, he broke up with her but didn't get back together with Lily. However, after some time, Dusty felt as if he didn't belong in Oakdale anymore. He decided it was time for him to leave Oakdale to give himself a fresh start in life. In 2003, Rose D'Angelo met a charming stranger who seemed to know Lily, Rose's twin sister. Though Rose tried to fight her feelings for the handsome and wealthy man, since she was engaged to Paul who had changed his name to \\"Ryan\\", she found herself falling for the man. It was then that Oakdale found out the man was, in fact, Dusty Donovan, who made a fortune while he was away. Rose tried to stay committed to Paul, but Dusty kept hitting on her and eventually the two had an affair. It turned out Barbara Ryan, Paul's mother, had paid Dusty to come between Paul and Rose. Paul did break off the engagement, but it was later back on track when Rose broke everything off with Dusty. Dusty took over the nightclub \\"Metro\\" and became business partners with Molly Conlan, with whom he soon started an affair. Though Molly fell in love with Dusty, he made it clear they only slept together and he had no intention dating her. Dusty got himself into trouble when he asked one of his employees, Aaron Snyder, to deliver a package for him. Aaron was caught by the cops and the package turned out to be drugs. Dusty was criticized by Aaron's father, Holden, by Lucy Montgomery, Aaron's girlfriend, and by Molly, who didn't understand what he was thinking. Shortly after this, Rose died after being poisoned by Will Munson. Lily and Dusty set up the \\"Rose D'Angelo Foundation\\". Around that same time, Dusty was threatened by some loan sharks, and Dusty turned out to be not so rich after all. He had to pay back some big money, so he stole from the foundation. This made Lily turn her back on Dusty and she stopped the foundation. Weeks later, Dusty found two guys in Metro attacking Lucy Montgomery. He saved her life, but Lucy's father Craig wasn't so grateful after Molly said those guys were probably the same ones who wanted the money from Dusty. When Dusty found out Lucy was leaving town, he went to her to ask if she could remember anything about those guys, but Lucy said she had no clear memory. Dusty let her go, but then he caught a glimpse of her limo driver and realized it was the same guy who attacked her. He chased the limo and pulled Lucy out of the car. They hid in a wooden cabin until the attackers found them again. They managed to escape and this time, they found an abandoned place where they hid out for weeks. Although they were first antagonistic towards each other, as Lucy was a spoiled 18-year-old, and Dusty a criminal 30-something, they grew closer, as both saved each other's lives several times. After Lucy could go back to Oakdale safely, they started a relationship against the wishes of Lucy's family. A few months later, Dusty was approached by an old friend, Dominic Ramsey, who planned to set up a boxing match in an Oakdale gym. Dusty found the perfect candidate in Aaron Snyder, but what Dusty, Lucy, and Aaron didn't know was Dom's boxer, Rafael, was ordered to fight with loaded gloves. When Rafi gave Aaron the final punch, Aaron slipped into a coma and was paralyzed. After finding out the secret, Dusty went after Dom, who said to leave him alone or he would come after Lucy. Then Lucy and Rafael were taken by Dominic and they disappeared from the face of the earth. After weeks, Dusty finally found out where they were: an abandoned mineshaft in the mountains. Dusty found them and brought them home safely. Lucy was unsure what to do with her future next, after she slept with Rafael in the mine. Dusty, in the meantime, realized he wanted to be with Lucy no matter what and bought an engagement ring. When he was about to propose, Lucy told him she was going back to Montega and going to college. Though it broke Dusty's heart, he understood and he let her leave Oakdale. Months later, he found Meg Snyder back in Oakdale, who had returned after years of absence. Dusty renewed his relationship with her, but in the meantime befriended Jennifer Munson, Paul Ryan's sister. Jennifer, who was his business partner, was pregnant by Mike Kasnoff, but later revealed to Dusty that the unborn child was actually Craig Montgomery's after a one-night stand. Dusty, knowing what Craig was capable of, promised to protect Jennifer when he had to. Mike and Jennifer divorced after Mike discovered Jen had been working with Dusty to take out Craig and didn't tell him about it. Dusty soon found himself falling in love with Jennifer, but being in a relationship with Meg, he decided not to do anything. However, things changed when Dusty found out Meg lied to him about Johnny, Jenn's supposedly deceased baby. Johnny was in fact still alive but was switched at birth by Craig. Dusty was furious with Meg and didn't understand how she could keep a mother away from her baby. He broke up with Meg and moved on with Jennifer. Jen was still distracted over the death of her brother Paul, but when Dusty discovered Paul still alive, he became outraged and attacked him. However, Dusty was suddenly hit from behind and woke up hours later in an abandoned cabin. He was visited by Emily Stewart, who had taken him hostage. She didn't want Dusty to kill Paul, who was her ex-fianc√©. After weeks of trying to convince Emily to let him go, Dusty was found by Jennifer, who had tracked down Emily's whereabouts. Jen and Dusty reunited. Jennifer and Dusty became engaged weeks later, and Dusty adopted Johnny. Sadly, Johnny was admitted to the hospital and was diagnosed with a rare type of blood cancer. Dusty was surprised when he found out the new doctor treating Johnny, was, in fact, Lucy, who had returned a year after her departure. She made it clear right away she didn't want anything from him and wished him luck with Jen and Johnny. Thanks to Emily, who was pregnant with Paul's child, they could cure Johnny with Emily's unborn baby. Another disaster hit them when Jen felt ill and was rushed to the hospital. Being alone without her son for so long, Jen was determined to leave the hospital against Lucy's orders. Dusty found Jen unconscious on the floor of their apartment and rushed her back to the hospital. There, the doctors told him Jen's heart was infected and she couldn't be saved. Jen wished to be married, and on her deathbed, she married Dusty. As Dusty held her in his arms, she died, leaving him widowed behind. For weeks, Dusty blamed Lucy for Jen's death, because she was Jen's doctor. However, he couldn't help himself but worry about Lucy when she got involved with Damian Grimaldi, a dangerous man. Dusty followed her and he was able to save her in time from everything. After this, he realized she wasn't to blame and he forgave her. Dusty and Lucy started to hang out more and became friends again, going on dates occasionally. They were often pressured by Lucinda, Lucy's grandmother, who wanted the two back together again, but pushed away by Barbara Ryan, who felt Dusty should grieve some more. When an ice storm hit Oakdale, Johnny got seriously ill and Lucy took him to the hospital. After realizing Lucy almost died in the storm trying to save Johnny's life, Dusty completely trusted her. When Craig returned from jail, Lucy stood by Dusty's side after Craig fought custody over Johnny Montgomery. However, in court, Lucy suddenly decided not to testify against Craig, leaving him a free man. Dusty didn't understand why she did it and was outraged when, days later, he found no Johnny in his house and realized Lucy had taken off with her little brother. Despite all efforts, Lucy could not be tracked down. Dusty bonded with Emily Stewart, who begged him to help her find her sister Alison, who apparently was addicted to crystal meth and had become a porn star. They tracked Ali down and brought her back to Oakdale. After spending so much time together, Dusty and Emily started something of a relationship. This could not prevent Dusty from sleeping with Alison, which, unfortunately, was caught on tape. After Emily saw this tape, she left Oakdale. Dusty still befriended Ali anyway, but he felt lost in Oakdale without Jen, Johnny, or Emily. When Emily returned, she had begun a relationship with Chris Hughes, who returned with her. Despite his efforts to make Emily forgive him, Emily couldn't and demanded he leave her alone. Dusty got involved with old love Lily, who had recently separated her husband Holden. Dusty and Lily slept together, but Dusty couldn't get his mind off Emily. Dusty, therefore, focused his attention on bringing Chris down, and he found an interesting way of doing so when Chris' father Bob collapsed. Dusty found out a young biotechnologist named Evan Walsh IV could have had something to do with this. Since Evan was working for Chris, Dusty collected all the evidence he could. He confronted Emily with it, but she wouldn't believe him. However, things did start to heat up between them and they slept together on New Year's Eve. When Dusty finally had all the evidence against Evan and Chris, Dusty was already so hated by Oakdale he decided to skip town. However, he was found dead on January 18, 2008. Emily, Chris, Holden, and Lily were among the suspects, each having a motive to kill Dusty. He had been injected with a lethal dose of potassium chloride, a heart- stopping cardiotoxin. All of them were cleared of the charges, and then Lily and Lucinda were suddenly held hostage by Evan, who turned out to be Dusty's killer. Evan didn't get further than the roof of the hospital after he was injected with the same drug used on Dusty. Barbara organized a funeral for Dusty, but being hated by the whole town, few showed. Dusty returns On September 24, 2008, Meg Snyder Ryan was taken hostage by James Stenbeck and taken to a deserted island and locked in a small cabin. When she investigated the cabin, she discovered Dusty locked in a cage in a wine cellar. He explained that he faked his death, using a drug to slow his heartbeat to make it appear as if he had died so he could flee Oakdale and go after Lucy and Johnny. He had never gotten that far because he was taken by someone and put in the cage. Meg's husband Paul found the two of them in a nearby windmill shortly after. James then told Paul that Dusty was after Meg. Dusty said James was the real crook and pointed a gun at him. James grabbed at the gun and the two men struggled. Paul then shot at his father, but the bullet grazed Dusty, causing him to fall on James. This caused James to fall himself, off the windmill balcony and to his death. Paul then took Meg back home. Dusty stayed behind, promising not to go back to Oakdale. But when Lieutenant Margo Montgomery Hughes found out that an unknown man was shot at the windmill, she started to question Meg. Dusty had sworn her to secrecy about him so she kept quiet. Margo threatened to put Meg in jail if she didn't talk. Being pregnant and unable to go to jail, but also to betray Dusty, she contacted the P.I. that Dusty had told her about who could help Meg contact him if she needed anything. She told him of her situation and the P.I. told this to Dusty. On the night of the opening of the \\"Luke Snyder Foundation\\", Dusty showed up at Metro and shocked everybody with his return. Lucinda turned out to be aware of his plan and had helped him get out of town. Dusty was interrogated by Margo and he told her the story. Afterward, he reunited with Emily and the pair made love. At the reading of James' will shortly after, Paul goes ballistic that Dusty was still the heir to the Stenbeck fortune. Meanwhile, Meg receives a call from Paul's accountant saying Paul borrowed from Worldwide Industries illegally to finance the sanitation of the contaminated soil on her mother Emma Snyder's farm that James caused; that way he could continue his development project. Meg told Dusty and asked him to pay off the loan to keep her and Paul from going bankrupt. Dusty, still being friends with Meg, agrees. Paul is furious when he finds out, and still furious about Dusty's plan to flee from Oakdale and upset over James' apparent death, he went crazy. He threatened Dusty multiple times and warned him to stay away from Meg. Emily told Dusty that Paul was serious, but Dusty laughed in Paul's face. Paul then went to New York City and hired an actress and her son to roam the world pretending to be Lucy and Johnny so that Dusty would see them and follow them, leaving town and Meg. Dusty fell for it and followed them only to find this was all a set-up arranged by Paul when he catches them in New York. Dusty confronted Paul in front of Meg and she said if Paul did anything else, they were over. Paul then decides to sell Worldwide Industries so he can focus more on Meg and their baby she was expecting. Not wanting to own a large corporation anymore, Lucinda agrees to find a buyer rather than buy it back. Lucinda discusses this with Dusty and he decides to use the overseas corporation he owned to buy Worldwide, knowing Paul would never sell Worldwide to him. Shortly after, Paul went to Derek Coburn, James' ex-henchman, and paid him $3,000 to plant drugs on Dusty. But unfortunately for Paul, Derek wasn't the same guy he was while working for James and didn't do the job. He went to Meg and told her what Paul did and returned the $3,000. When Meg confronts Paul, he denies it, but Meg gets Paul to slip up. She then packs up her pull- along suitcase and goes to stay with Emma. After Meg told Dusty about what Paul tried to get Derek to do, he went and met Derek and paid him to be Meg's bodyguard from Paul. Sometime after this, Dusty learned of a mysterious red- headed woman living in New York who had amnesia and was going by the initials of J.M.D. Dusty didn't know what to think but soon became convinced that this woman might be his deceased wife Jennifer. He took off to New York and found the woman, who was a dead ringer for Jennifer, but wasn't Jennifer herself. Her name was Josie Matthews Driver, and she recently had an accident, which had caused her amnesia. However, she did have certain memories that people could confirm weren't hers. When she told them to Dusty, he recognized them as events that happened to Jennifer, and the two became more convinced that Josie was somehow connected to Jennifer. Emily warned Dusty about Josie, and told him she was bad news, but Dusty rejected her concerns. He and Josie grew closer and eventually made love. What Dusty didn't know at the time was that Josie knew exactly who she was, and she didn't have any memories of Jen's life. She was hired two weeks earlier by Paul, who was obsessed with getting Dusty out of town (still believing his father about Dusty trying to steal Meg). Josie told Paul she didn't want to go through with the plan anymore because she had started to fall in love with Dusty. Paul offered her more money and added that Dusty never would've like Josie if she didn't remind him so much of Jennifer. Paul then had Josie pretend to have visions of Johnny in Norway. When she told Dusty of these visions, they prepared to fly there. When Josie didn't show up on Dusty's corporate jet, he canceled the flight. Meanwhile, Emily overheard Paul and Josie discussing how he had hired her to portray his sister. Emily then confronted Paul. Then she went to Dusty and told him Josie was being hired by Paul to portray Jennifer in an argument, leaving out that Paul had hired her to do so. Dusty figured out that it was Paul who hired Josie and went to confront him. Emily called Paul to tell him that Dusty knew and that he was coming over to confront him. Paul then got Meg out of the house by sending her ornament shopping. He then grabbed his gun. When Dusty arrived and told Paul what he did, Paul denied doing anything. Dusty pushed and Paul admitted to hiring Josie to portray Jennifer to get Dusty out of town. Paul then told Dusty to stay away from Meg. But Dusty said he was going to tell Meg what Paul did and she'd never trust Paul again afterward. Paul pointed his gun at Dusty and said he was going to kill him. Dusty warned Paul if he did this then Meg would never want him again, but Paul said it was worth the risk. Dusty then grabbed at the gun and they struggled. Dusty managed to get the gun away from Paul. Paul then grabbed an ax and held it up at Dusty. Dusty pointed the gun at Paul and told him to drop it. Paul started to do so and suddenly ran towards Dusty with the ax. Dusty was then forced to shoot Paul in self-defense, just as Meg entered the room. She ran to Paul, who said Dusty tried to kill him. Dusty then goes to Java and calls Josie, who is leaving town, to meet him there, saying he owes it to him after what she's done. She then meets him and he asked her why she agreed to portray Jennifer. She told him she had expensive college loans and Paul agreed to pay them off, saying it was easy money. Dusty also asked her what her real name was. She told him it was Josie Anderson, Josie being short for Josephine. He told her how he shot Paul and how the police were after him. Josie said she can prove that Paul hired her to portray Jennifer to the police and if she did, they'd believe that Paul being shot was in self-defense. Dusty wouldn't hear of it. When the police arrived at Java to arrest Dusty, he left unspotted and hid at Metro. Meg finds him there and accuses him of trying to kill Paul. Dusty told her how Paul hired Josie to portray Jennifer and how when he confronted Paul, he tried to kill him, and how he shot Paul in self-defense because Paul came at him with an ax. Meg doesn't believe him and calls the police and tell them where Dusty was hiding. Margo then arrests Dusty. While in jail, Craig Montgomery (having recently returned to town) arrives, telling Dusty he's on his side. Dusty doesn't believe it and to prove it, he finds Josie and brings her to the police station. Dusty thinks it's a trick and asks how she got involved with Craig. Josie said she didn't know him and she again offers to tell the police about Paul hiring her but again, Dusty won't hear of it. Josie asks him why he's protecting her. He tells her it's because, like Jennifer, she too was a victim of Paul Ryan and he didn't want her to suffer anymore because of him. Josie tells Dusty that she loved him like Jennifer. Dusty tells Josie to tell Meg the truth about Paul. When she arrives at their house, Paul tells Josie that Meg isn't home and so she sits down and waits. Paul grabs his gun. Just then, Meg comes home and Paul quickly hides the gun. Paul tells Meg that Josie is here to lie on Dusty's behalf. Josie then tells Meg how Paul hired her to portray Jennifer to get Dusty out of town and how when Dusty found out, he went to confront Paul, who tried to kill him, but Dusty shot him in self-defense. Paul tells Meg she's lying on Dusty's behalf so Dusty can get out of jail, but Josie told Meg she was going to tell this to the police, but Dusty wouldn't allow it. She told Meg how Dusty didn't care about getting out of jail, only about Meg knowing the truth about Paul. After Josie left, Meg questions Paul about this. Paul desperately continues to deny what Josie claimed, but because he'd previously tried to get Dusty out of town, Meg doesn't believe Paul. She tells him to look her in the eyes and tell her what he did to Dusty. Paul finally confesses that he did what Josie claimed to keep him from stealing Meg. Meg reminded him that she kept telling him that she was finished with Dusty and that Paul only did it because he cared more about fighting \\"the same old battles\\" than he did losing her. She then makes him tell the police the truth. He does and Dusty is freed. He and Josie go to Java to celebrate. When Paul got home, Meg had her suitcase packed saying she's leaving him. Paul pleads for her to reconsider saying their baby needed both parents. But Meg tells Paul their baby needs a mother who isn't afraid to leave her father because he can't be trusted. She then returns to Emma's. A few days later, Meg goes and apologizes to Dusty for what Paul did to him and she should have known he was just lying to her like he always does. She then tells Dusty she's getting a divorce from Paul. Dusty then takes her to Java where they catch Paul harassing Josie. They get him to back off. Later, Josie told Dusty that Paul was harassing her to tell Meg he had a change of heart about hiring Josie and when he told her to stop, she refused because she liked portraying someone she's not, getting the idea from Barbara. Paul even offered Josie money to change her story, but she refused. Paul then overdoses on anxiety pills to get Meg to help him and realize she wanted him, getting the idea from his father's ghost. He leaves her a suicide note and she finds him lying unconscious on the floor at his cabin. Meg desperately tries to revive him but gets no response, and tries to drag Paul to safety. This causes her to go into labor. She calls Dusty, who is with Josie at Al's Diner, and tells him of this. He then goes to the cabin and finds Meg going into labor and an unconscious Paul. He calls an ambulance for Paul and tells Meg he'll have to get her to the hospital now. Meg wants to stay to tell the E.M.T.s what Paul overdosed on. Dusty finds the pill bottle and sets it beside Paul, saying now they'll know what Paul overdosed on. He then picks up Meg and takes her to the hospital, where she gives birth to a premature but healthy baby girl, Eliza. When Craig returns to town, Dusty and Paul team up to get back at their enemy. However, where there's a father, a daughter is never far behind, and soon, Dusty comes face to face with Lucy, who has reached a point where she will kill everyone who gets in her way of getting what she wants. After Josie told Dusty that Lucy and Johnny were back, Alison had to give in and let Dusty see Johnny. Since then, they have tried to shield Johnny from Craig. Craig finds out about this. Dusty and Lucy plan to leave town with Johnny. Craig finds out and calls Margo to have her arrest Lucy for kidnapping Johnny. Dusty tells Lucy she needs to leave town cause even if she isn't charged, Craig will find a way to make her suffer for what she did. Lucy agrees, but says Dusty must try to make peace with Craig for Johnny's sake and she must say goodbye to Johnny. Josie leads them on a wild goose chase, giving Lucy time to say goodbye to Johnny before leaving town on Dusty's corporate jet. When Craig and Margo get back after realizing they were tricked, Craig demands Margo arrest Dusty and Josie for aiding a kidnapper. Margo said if she did, everyone (including Johnny) will always hate him. Dusty offers to make peace with Craig if he spares him. Craig reluctantly agreed. They struggled to do so, resulting in Dusty calling for a custody hearing to take Craig's custody rights for Johnny from him. Craig attempted to marry Carly Tenney to make a judge think he was a family man. Unfortunately for Craig, Carly dumped him at the altar, leaving him single. Dusty proposed to Meg to make him also look like a family man. He said it will prove to her estranged husband Paul that their life together was over and he'll stop stalking her to get her to take him back. Meg refused, not being in love with him, but Dusty convinces her to consider. He tells Josie that he has to do it for Johnny because he comes first. Paul went to Emma's to see Meg to convince her to take him back. Meg almost considers, but brings up Dusty's proposal, having been told by an angry Josie. They argue and Meg tells him to leave. Paul tells her she still loves him and she reminds him she never denied it, only the fact she can't take him back and his behavior just confirms it. Paul threatened Meg, telling her she can't ever live without him. A disgusted Meg told Dusty she'll marry him. On January 26, 2009, they were married in Reno, Nevada in a small, simple ceremony, following the finalization of her divorce from Paul that day. It was only when they returned that they learned from Lily and Holden that Craig and Carly didn't marry.

Background  Bobby √Ñiki√§'s mother, Niina √Ñiki√§, gave birth to the boy when she was 19 years old. Because of his medical condition, √Ñiki√§ was intellectually disabled and had difficulty socializing with other people. Niina regarded the child as a nuisance, regarding him more as a younger brother than as a son. A support family was assigned for Bobby that he visited each week. Niina eventually fell in with a man named Eddy Larsson, who had previously been incarcerated for rape. Larsson enticed Niina with promises of a quiet country life in a quaint little croft with a few animals to raise, causing her to move out of her home and away from Bobby's support family to move in with Larsson. However, Niina discovered that he'd actually rented an old dilapidated croft that had no animals at all. The croft had no toilet, no hot water, minimal electricity and was heated by cab heaters and a stove.  Torture  The couple's abuse of √Ñiki√§ is believed to have begun in autumn 2005, when Niina witnessed Larsson shove the boy's head into a plate of food after he'd grown annoyed with Bobby for not eating. The food was later revealed to be ravioli with cat food mixed into it. √Ñiki√§ was burned with cigarettes, had his genitals beaten with wooden sticks, would be electrocuted via an electric fence located in the nearby sheep pasture, had liquor forced down his throat with a funnel, had a vacuum cleaner hose placed onto his penis, and was forced to lie naked in the snow where he would sometimes have snow shoveled onto him. One particular incident recalled later by Niina involved √Ñiki√§ defecating himself, whereupon Larsson forced the boy to wear the stained underwear on his face for a day and a half.  Murder  By December 2005, the abuse had reached a point where, in order to hide their actions, √Ñiki√§'s parents advised his school that he would be absent for an extended period of time due to illness. On 13 January 2006, after another episode of abuse, √Ñiki√§ was tied to a chair and thrown out of the house by Larsson. He was eventually brought back inside by his parents and placed in front of the stove to warm up. Sometime after, √Ñiki√§ was moved to his bedroom and placed into his bed. On 14 January 2006, Bobby was found dead by his mother, Niina, who believed he had died choking on a half-eaten orange. Larsson claimed to have conducted CPR on Bobby to no avail. √Ñiki√§'s parents hid his body in a nearby woodshed for several days before it was decided to pack him into the trunk of their car. After searching for a location to dispose of the body, they settled on Lake Lovsj√∂n, south of J√∂nk√∂ping. The body was wrapped in chains and submerged in the lake. On 29 January 2006, the couple reported him missing after a visit to the B√§ckebol shopping centre in Gothenburg. Soldiers from the Swedish Armed Forces were mobilized to search for √Ñiki√§. However, when a body could not be found, suspicion turned towards Niina and Larsson. By February 2006 the two were arrested for suspicion of murder and, following Niina's confession to police, √Ñiki√§ was found under the ice in Lake Lovsj√∂n.  Trial  In May 2006, at the Eksj√∂ District Court, the trial against Niina and Larsson began. Neither of the two considered themselves responsible for Bobby's death and blamed each other.

The trial ended with the couple's conviction for murder, aggravated assault and gross negligence causing death. In June 2006, they were sentenced to ten years imprisonment.citenewsurl=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,872352,00.htmltitle=Gr√•ter √∂ppet i r√§ttenwork=Aftonbladetlanguage=Swedishaccessdate=12 December 2010}}  Aftermath  √Ñiki√§'s death attracted a lot of media attention and strong public reactions.

It includes more than 500 photos and artifacts that depict the Jewish experience in Florida since 1763. The museum also has several temporary exhibits on display each year. The museum mounts and hosts its own and traveling exhibitions; sponsors cultural and educational programs; houses a Collections & Research Center reflecting Florida Jewish history since 1763; and communicates Jewish history, values and issues to Jews and non-Jews alike in an informal manner. History The museum is located in Miami Beach's first synagogue, the original home of Congregation Beth Jacob, was designed by architect H. Frasser Rose and built in 1929 at 311 Washington Avenue. The site was chosen because at the time the synagogue was built, Jews were concentrated in the south end of the city, due to restrictions on where they could reside. Its construction satisfied an urgent need of the small Jewish community of residents and winter visitors who had first settled on Miami Beach in 1913. It established that Jews were accepted and a permanent part of the resident population of the City. Prior to this, Jews had been denied permission to construct a synagogue. They had to ferry across Biscayne Bay (and later the County Causeway, now the MacArthur Causeway, built in 1920) to attend religious services at B'nai Zion Congregation in Miami. When Orthodox Jews, who do not travel on Shabbat and high holidays, joined the congregation, they and the winter visitors from Canada and Miami Beach residents held services in the Royal Apartments at 221 Collins Avenue. In 1924, Malvina Weiss Leibman organized and taught Sunday School classes in a vacant lot on the west side of Washington Avenue north of Third Street. Beginning in 1926 and during construction of Beth Jacob, services were held on the roof of the David Court Apartments at 56 Washington Avenue, owned by the Granat family. The first rabbi was reportedly Rabbi David Yallow followed by Rabbis Hurowitz, Axelrod and David I. Rosenbloom. Rabbi Moses Mescheloff served the congregation from 1937 to 1954. In 1954, Rabbi Mescheloff went to Chicago, in time to celebrate Chanukah with his new congregation in West Rogers Park, Congregation K.I.N.S. (Knesset Israel Nusach Sfard). The congregation had a life contract with Rabbi Mescheloff, who became ‚ÄúRabbi Emeritus‚Äù upon his retirement. Rabbi Mescheloff died in 2008 in Chicago. Subsequent spiritual leaders were Rabbis Akiva Chill, Tibor Stern (1955‚Äì65), Shmaryahu T. Swirsky (1965‚Äì92) and Moshe Berenholz. Almost every Jew who was a permanent resident of Miami Beach between 1927 and 1932 was a member and financial contributor to the synagogue. The initial role of the Synagogue as the religious and social center of the Jewish community soon developed into being the Jewish cultural center as well. A Hebrew school was established, scholars, rabbis and cantors were invited and a mikvah (ritual bath for women) was built in 1944 for $35,000 ($ in current dollar terms) at 151 Michigan Avenue. The original building was dedicated on February 17, 1929. The founding officers were Lazarus Abramowitz, President; Jekuthiel Kaplan, Vice President; Morris Abraham, Treasurer; Samuel Guttman, Secretary; and Joseph Tilzer and Harry Levitt, building committee members. In 1936, the congregation outgrew its original facility and constructed a second larger adjacent building for the synagogue at 301 Washington Avenue, designed by Miami Beach architect Henry Hohauser. The original building was used as the religious school and social hall. Faced in stucco, the two-story building has a rectangular plan and a gable roof. The central entrance consists of three double doors of simple, vertical panels and large iron hinges of Spanish style. The top of the building fa√ßade has a contemporary plaque reading \\"Beth Jacob Social Hall, 5689-1929.\\" The fa√ßade is crowned by the tablets with the Ten Commandments. Inside, the main hall is two stories in height. A two-story addition of concrete block was built to the east in 1946, containing offices, meeting rooms, and classrooms. Towards the end of the 20th century, Beth Jacob Congregation began to dwindle and moved all of its functions back to this original building. Many of its older members died. There were hardly enough members remaining to have a minyan (the ten men required for many parts of the religious services) and in 2005, the congregation went out of business. The Jewish Museum of Florida, which needed room to expand its facilities beyond the confines of the adjacent building it has occupied since 1995, purchased the original synagogue, ensuring that the building so rich in Jewish history will continue to be preserved and become a repository for the chronology of Florida's Jews. The renovation of the 311 building was completed in 2007. The building has offices located upstairs in the former women's balcony on the west side. The area on the east side of the second floor, which was formerly the synagogue's classrooms, houses the Collections and Research area. The former sanctuary on the main level of the building was converted to a multi- purpose gallery which serves as a second exhibit venue for the museum and is also used for public programs and special events. Museum Director Susan Gladstone is featured in The Last Resort, a 2018 documentary film about Jewish life in South Beach in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Collection The museum's collection comprises more than 100,000 artifacts, objects, photographs, documents, and religious objects relating to Florida Jewish heritage.

When a US newspaper condemned his act of depicting Jesus on a chocolate, Manderson decided in answer to create an actual life-size chocolate Jesus he called Trans-substantiation 2. He did so by filling a plaster mold with fifty-five pounds of melted chocolate. He used chocolate-dipped strings for hair and plastic Easter wrap for a loincloth. Manderson's work was exhibited in public around Easter in 1994, with Manderson inviting the public to come and eat his chocolate Jesus work after the exhibition. Manderson explained that he felt that what had originated as a solemn holiday in contemplation of the resurrection of Christ had become a \\"rather ugly period of over consumption\\". 2006: George Heslop's work George Heslop, an English artist created the Jesus Crucifixion scene made of chocolate.

Blue nevus (also known as \\"blue neuronevus\\", \\"dermal melanocytoma\\", \\"nevus coeruleus\\" and \\"nevus bleu\\") is a type of melanocytic nevus. The blue colour is caused by the pigment being deeper in the skin than in ordinary nevi. In principle they are harmless but they can sometimes be mimicked by malignant lesions, i.e. some melanomas can look like a blue nevus. Classification Blue nevi may be divided into the following types: * A patch blue nevus (also known as an \\"acquired dermal melanocytosis\\", and \\"dermal melanocyte hamartoma\\") is a cutaneous condition characterized by a diffusely gray-blue area that may have superimposed darker macules. * A blue nevus of Jadassohn‚ÄìTi√®che (also known as a \\"common blue nevus\\", and \\"nevus ceruleus\\") is a cutaneous condition characterized by a steel-blue papule or nodule. * A cellular blue nevus is a cutaneous condition characterized by large, firm, blue or blue-black nodules. * An epithelioid blue nevus is a cutaneous condition most commonly seen in patients with the Carney complex. * A deep penetrating nevus is a type of benign melanocytic skin tumor characterized, as its name suggests, by penetration into the deep dermis and/or subcutis. Smudged chromatic is a typical finding. In some cases mitotic figures or atypical melanocytic cytology are seen, potentially mimicking a malignant melanoma. Evaluation by an expert skin pathologist is advisable in some cases to help differentiate from invasive melanoma. * An amelanotic blue nevus (also known as a \\"hypomelanotic blue nevus\\") is a cutaneous condition characterized by mild atypia and pleomorphism. * A malignant blue nevus is a cutaneous condition characterized by a sheet-like growth pattern, mitoses, necrosis, and cellular atypia.

It is used by several different cells involved in the immune system, including granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils) and mast cells. It is also used by certain lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells, whose main purpose is to destroy invading microorganisms. Mast cells Antigens interact with IgE molecules already bound to high affinity Fc receptors on the surface of mast cells to induce degranulation, via the activation of tyrosine kinases within the cell. The mast cell releases a mixture of compounds, including histamine, proteoglycans, serotonin, and serine proteases from its cytoplasmic granules. Eosinophils In a similar mechanism, activated eosinophils release preformed mediators such as major basic protein, and enzymes such as peroxidase, following interaction between their Fc receptors and IgE molecules that are bound to large parasites like helminths. Neutrophils Four kinds of granules exist in neutrophils that display differences in content and regulation. Secretory vesicles are the most likely to release their contents by degranulation, followed by gelatinase granules, specific granules, and azurophil granules.

Career As a youngster, Fran√ßois joined the regiment his father was serving in, and in 1754 was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. In 1755 he travelled to Constantinople, the capital city of the Ottoman Empire, as the secretary of his uncle Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, who had been appointed ambassador. His main duty was to learn the Turkish language, to investigate the situation in the Ottoman Empire and to gather information about the Crimean Khanate. He returned to Paris in 1763, and was sent to Switzerland in 1766 by the French government. In 1767, he was appointed consul in Crimea in order to learn about the country and incite the Crimean Tatars to rebel against the Imperial Russia. Fran√ßois de Tott played a major role during the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774). Leaving Crimea for a while, he was commissioned by the Ottoman government with the task of defending the Dardanelles against the Russian fleet. Following in the footprints of Claude Alexandre de Bonneval, known as Humbaracƒ± Ahmed Pasha, Fran√ßois de Tott was involved in the reform efforts for the Ottoman military. He succeeded in having a new foundry built to make howitzers, and was instrumental in the creation of mobile artillery units. He built fortifications on the Bosphorus and started a naval science course that laid the foundation stone for the later naval school.

It was founded in 1992, is based in Rio de Janeiro, and gained international notoriety in 2005 when it launched the fashion line Daspu. Goals Davida works in HIV/AIDS prevention and tries to improve the working conditions and the legal and societal status of prostitutes in Brazil. Its main aim is to end the discrimination of prostitutes and the recognition of prostitution as a regular profession.Nach Strich und Faden, taz, 6 January 2007.

The organization was founded in 1992 by retired prostitute Gabriela Silva Leite, who holds a degree in sociology, and her partner Flavio Lenz.From red light to runway , Marie Claire UK, 26 July 2007 In 1978 she had already organized a demonstration in S√£o Paulo against police brutality, because of the murder of a prostitute friend. In 1987 she organized the first prostitution congress, a meeting of Brazilian prostitutes to create a network of sex worker initiatives.Von der Sexarbeiterin zur Prostituierten, Lateinamerika Nachrichten, November 2005. The name \\"Davida\\" refers to the phrase \\"Mulheres da Vida\\" (\\"women of life\\") commonly used for prostitutes in Brazil. Activities Most of the members of Davida are (ex-)prostitutes. Some of them are being paid to distribute condoms and information material in the night scene of Rio. The organization is supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. In 2002 pressure by Davida contributed to the Brazilian Ministry of Labor adding \\"sex worker\\" to an official list of occupations.Street wear: Rio's prostitutes give nod to line of clothes, Stamford Advocate, 16 June 2006 In 2003 Davida supported the introduction of new legislation, based on the German model, that would have allowed prostitutes to sue for payment and would have legalized brothels. The law was not passed. When officials moved to close hotels used by prostitutes and their customers in the historical center of Rio de Janeiro, Davida members met with the city government, performed songs at Pra√ßa Tiradentes, and were able to prevent the action. Davida is at the center of a network of prostitute organizations all over Brazil, the Brazilian Prostitutes Network, with 20,000 members. =Daspu= Davida developed the idea of a fashion line to raise money after Brazil turned down $40 million in U.S. anti-AIDS funding in 2005 because a U.S. law required recipients to sign an explicit anti-prostitution pledge. The name \\"Daspu\\" abbreviates \\"das putas\\" (\\"from the whores\\") but is also a play on the name of the luxurious S√£o Paulo fashion house \\"Daslu\\" (abbreviation of \\"from the Lu\\", \\"Lu\\" being the common nickname of the founders \\"L√∫cia\\" and \\"Lourdes\\").Origin of luxurious fashion house \\"Daslu\\", Folha de S.Paulo, 26 March 2009. Daslu threatened to sue over the name but soon after was embroiled in a tax evasion scandal, leading to much free publicity for Daspu in Brazil.Au Br√©sil, les prostitu√©es sont √† la mode, Le Monde, 18 November 2006. The first Daspu designs, in November 2005, were t-shirts. During the week of Fashion Rio 2005, several Davida sex workers showed these at a catwalk show they had organized at Pra√ßa Tiradentes, where many of them did business. In March 2006, they hired the professional designer Rafaela Monteiro, whose work was reviewed and subject to approved by the Davida members. The designs often refer to prostitution in an ironic way, with phrases like \\"Lost Women are the Most Wanted\\", \\"Before the Show, Tune Your Instrument\\" and \\"We‚Äôre Bad, but We Could be Worse\\". The first collection, \\"on the piste\\", used motives from the world of truck drivers, the prostitutes' largest group of customers. Daspu continued to hold several fashion shows in Rio and S√£o Paulo, with prostitutes as models, and photos of Daspu models appeared in the Brazilian edition of Vogue.Sex finally in fashion , Miami Herald, 24 July 2006 In November 2006, they performed at the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial under the direction of the Slovenian artist Tadej Pogacar, culminating in the presentation of a wedding dress made from flophouse towels and condoms, worn by an HIV-positive prostitute.Meet Jane : prostitute, mother and model , The Observers by France 24, 12 May 2007 Some pieces from Daspu were included in the catalog of a Paris fashion house, and the French lingerie designer Fifi Chachnil declared she will represent the line. In April 2008, members of Davida exhibited items in Milan that were created together with the Italian designer Antonio Cagianelli. Daspu presented its 2009 collection in parallel with S√£o Paulo Fashion Week in June 2008.Grife de prostitutas apresenta cole√ß√£o ver√£o 2009 em SP, Folha Online, 18 June 2008. While the sale of fashion does not yet create substantial net income for Daspu, a 2008 report by the Open Society Institute lauded the project for its innovative way of creating publicity and increasing public acceptance of sex work.Breaking Barriers to HIV Prevention, Treatment, and Care for Women by Melanie Croce- Galis (ed.), Open Society Institute, 2008 Leite stated that the increased self-confidence of the participating women was a major benefit of the project. =Other publicity projects= Davida has also attempted to create publicity in other ways, with carnival parades,From the brothel to the bloco, The Guardian, 4 January 2006 street serenades by 12 vocally trained prostitutes, and a theater play about AIDS, prostitutes and human rights. In July 2007 Davida released a book, As Meninas da Daspu (\\"The Daspu Girls\\"), featuring interviews with nine prostitutes.Confid√™ncias de meninas da Daspu tra√ßam trajet√≥ria da profiss√£o, Folha Online, 14 June 2007. The book was introduced with a bikini show in a book store. In April 2009, Gabriela Leite released her autobiography, titled Filha, M√£e, Av√≥ e Puta (\\"Daughter, Mother, Grandmother and Slut\\"). In June 2010, it was announced that the book will be used as base for an upcoming film of the same title. Gabriela Leite will be portrayed by Vanessa Gi√°como.

Synopsis Shamsher Singh (Dilip Kumar), his son Pratap Singh (Suresh Oberoi), and daughter-in-law lead a happy life in an Indian village. Shamsher works as an engine driver with his friend Gurbaksh Singh (Shammi Kapoor). Pratap is appointed as the new inspector-in-charge of the village, but is killed brutally by Jagawar Chaudhary (Amrish Puri), a notorious local smuggler, after Pratap refuses to help Jagawar in his illegal activities. Seeing his son dead, Shamsher Singh is enraged and he kills some of Jagawar's goons whom he had seen throwing his son's dead body in the forest. When he is about to inquire from one of Jagawar's men about the person behind his son's murder, he is stopped by the police and is asked to surrender; Shamsher somehow manages to escape. His daughter-in-law dies while giving birth to Kunal Singh (Sanjay Dutt). Shamsher takes his grandson Kunal and leaves his village to hide from the police. In the hope of making quick money, to secure his grandson's future, Shamsher starts working for Sir Mizya (Shreeram Lagoo), a powerful underworld don, and takes on a new identity as Sir Shobraj. Over the course of time, he becomes a wealthy and powerful smuggler and the chairman of the Mizya Group. Meanwhile, Kunal grows up under the strict supervision of Shamsher's loyal employee Abu Baba (Sanjeev Kumar). He falls in love with Durga (Padmini Kolhapure), a beautiful slum girl and the daughter of one of Shamsher's old employee Ganpat. However, things take an ugly turn when Shamsher Singh disagrees to let Kunal marry Durga because of her being from a poor background; he instead warns Durga's mother (Sudha Shivpuri) to leave the city with her daughter or else face serious consequences. Although Durga is unwilling to leave at first, she later agrees to sacrifice her love and leaves with her mother in a ship to Goa where Shamsher's men try to rape her. Abu Baba comes to their rescue and saves them but is killed by Shamsher's men with the help of Jagawar, who has become a powerful smuggler of Goa. Kunal is devastated after seeing Abu Baba's dead body and promises to take revenge. His investigations into Abu Baba's death eventually lead to the true identity of his grandfather and about his father's killers.

Elected at the 1927 election as an independent to the three-member seat of Barossa, Basedow served as a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for a three-year term. He was defeated at the 1930 election but was again elected at the 1933 election, shortly before his death in June that year.Herbert Basedow: SA Parliament During his career, Basedow published widely on anthropology, geology and natural history. He also published detailed accounts of some of his expeditions and two major anthropological works on Aboriginal Australians. Personal life Herbert Basedow was born in Kent Town, South Australia, the youngest son of Martin Peter Friedrich Basedow and his second wife Anna Clara Helena, n√©e Muecke (or M»ïcke). Martin and Anna were both born in Germany and met after immigrating to Australia. Basedow's early education was in Adelaide. The Basedow family visited Germany between 1891 and 1894, and for part of that time Herbert Basedow attended high school in Hanover. He completed his schooling at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide. Between 1891 and 1902, Basedow completed a Bachelor of Science degree at the School of Mines, Adelaide, and the University of Adelaide. He majored in geology, but also studied botany and zoology.Zogbaum, Heidi. Changing Skin Colour in Australia: Herbert Basedow and the Black Caucasian, Australian Scholarly Publishing, 2010, pp.13-14.

His catalogue was published in 1907.Catalogue of minerals in the Technological Museum of the South Australian School of Mines and Industries, compiled by Herbert Basedow, Hon. Curator, Government Printer, Adelaide, 1907. Basedow was a keen photographer, and throughout his career he used photography to record his scientific work and his travels in remote parts of Australia. A set of 200 images taken on the 1903 South Australian Government prospecting expedition are the earliest known photographs by Basedow. He included more than 500 of his photographs in the articles and books he published and used them to illustrate his public lectures.Kaus, David.

In 1907, Basedow accepted an invitation from German anthropologist Hermann Klaatsch to study in Germany. In Europe, he completed postgraduate studies at several universities, including Heidelberg, G√∂ttingen, Breslau and Z√ºrich, and undertook some medical work. Basedow returned to Australia with a PhD in geology and two postgraduate qualifications in medicine. The medical degree he was awarded based on his work on the craniometric measurements of Aboriginal Australians, combined with his practical medical work in Europe, later allowed Basedow's registration as a medical practitioner in Australia.Zogbaum, Heidi (2003), \\"Herbert Basedow and the Removal of Aboriginal Children of Mixed Descent from their Families\\", Australian Historical Studies, 34: 121, 122‚Äì138 On his return from Europe in 1910, Basedow entered the geological department of South Australia as Assistant Government Geologist. He resigned from this position in 1911 to take up the newly created Australian federal government position of Chief Medical Officer and Chief Protector of Aborigines in the Northern Territory. He arrived in Darwin on 17 July 1911 and left 45 days later unhappy with his working conditions and claiming the legislation under which he was operating was unworkable. Basedow returned to Adelaide and set up in medical practice, combining this with consulting geological investigations for individuals and organisations. He continued to publish in learned journals, mainly on anthropology but also on geology. On 4 June 1919 in Adelaide, Basedow married Olive Nell \\"Nellie\\" Noyes, daughter of organist Arthur Charles Noyes. They had no children. Basedow died suddenly on 4 June 1933 of peripheral venous thrombosis in Kent Town and was buried in Adelaide's North Road Cemetery. Despite researching and publishing widely in anthropology, Basedow never held an official position as an anthropologist.

Photographer: Herbert Basedow Between 1903 and 1928, Basedow participated in around 12 major expeditions and some smaller trips. These were mainly to central and northern Australia. On these expeditions, Basedow obtained the material on which he based his anthropological and scientific research and photographed the people he encountered and the places he visited.Kaus, David. A Different Time: The Expedition Photographs of Herbert Basedow 1903-1928, National Museum of Australia Press, Canberra, 2008. Extract: Introduction The majority of the expeditions were to investigate mineral prospects. Some were government funded such as the 1903 South Australian Government North-West Prospecting Expedition and the 1905 geological investigation of the Northern Territory's western coast and hinterland. Others, like the 1916 expedition to investigate possible ore deposits in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, were commissioned by mining syndicates and private companies.A Different Time: The Expedition Photos of Herbert Basedow 1903-1928: 1916 expedition, National Museum of Australia. Retrieved 21 June 2011. Other expeditions included three medical relief expeditions to assess the health of Aboriginal people in South Australia - one in 1919 and two in 1920 - which Basedow led. Basedow also participated in two vice-regal expeditions to central Australia: one in 1923 organised by Sir Tom Bridges, Governor of South Australia, who was keen to build a north‚Äìsouth railway to open up central Australia; and one in 1924 involving Lord Stradbroke, Governor of Victoria. Basedow also participated in expeditions funded by wealthy pastoralist Donald Mackay to central Australia in 1926 and Arnhem Land in 1928.A Different Time: The Expedition Photos of Herbert Basedow 1903-1928, National Museum of Australia. Retrieved 6 June 2011. Basedow and Australian Aboriginal people At the time of his birth, Basedow's father held the office of Protector of Aborigines. In his early years, Basedow accompanied his father on trips into the outback where he played with Aboriginal children and acquired some native language skills. Throughout his life, Basedow maintained an interest in recording traditional Aboriginal life as well as a concern for the health and welfare of Aboriginal people.Zogbaum, Heidi. Changing Skin Colour in Australia: Herbert Basedow and the Black Caucasian, Australian Scholarly Publishing, 2010, p. 7; pp. 10-11. . The German anthropologist Hermann Klaatsch influenced Basedow's early ideas about Australian Aboriginal people. Both men theorised that Aboriginal people and Caucasians were racially related. A.O. Neville, Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia between 1915 and 1940, relied on Basedow's belief that there was close relationship between Aboriginal people and Europeans as the scientific basis for his proposal to solve the Aboriginal 'half caste problem' by selective breeding. When Arrernte artist Erlikilyika's works were exhibited in Adelaide in 1913, Basedow bought many of them. These are now in the National Museum of Australia. Basedow actively lobbied government for better treatment of Aboriginal people, especially through the Aborigines Protection League, and campaigned for an improvement in Aboriginal health. In 1919, he instigated a public meeting to highlight South Australia's neglect of Aboriginal people which led to a series of medical relief expeditions in 1919 and 1920. Basedow led these expeditions and his wife Nell accompanied him, acting as expedition nurse. An obituary of Basedow published in Nature magazine said that \\"since the death of Sir Walter Baldwin Spencer, Dr Basedow had been generally recognized as the first authority on the aborigines of Australia\\".Nature, 17 June 1933 Publications Basedow presented scientific papers at the Royal Society of South Australia and published them in the Society's journal while still at university. He continued to publish in the Society's journal until 1907. He went on to publish widely in anthropology, but also in geology and natural history.A Different Time: The Expedition Photos of Herbert Basedow 1903-1928: Further reading, National Museum of Australia. Retrieved 14 June 2011 On his return from the South Australian government prospecting expedition of 1903, Basedow published three papers from material gathered on the expedition. He was awarded the University of Adelaide's Tate Memorial Medal for one of these papers. In 1904, Basedow published anthropological notes taken on the 1903 expedition, and in 1914 his full journal of the expedition was published. It included some of Basedow's photographs taken on the expedition and a map of the expedition route.Basedow, H. Journal of the Government North-West Expedition, Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, South Australian Branch, vol. 15, 1914, pp. 57-242.

Preece and Sons, Adelaide, 1925 This major anthropological work included many of Basedow's own photographs. Basedow pitched his writing to a general readership to make it available to a wide audience. The Australian Aboriginal was reprinted in 1929.

Knights of the Boomerang: Episodes From a Life Spent Among the Native Tribes of Australia, Endeavour Press, Sydney, 1935. Once again, Basedow pitched the book to a general readership, stating in his introduction that his aim was to \\"recount first-hand impressions and experiences, without attempting to surround them with technicalities and extraneous embellishments\\".

Between 1903 and 1928, Basedow took photographs and collected specimens and artefacts on many major expeditions and some smaller trips, mainly to central and northern Australia. Basedow's photographs record life in the remote parts of Australia early in the twentieth century. They depict Aboriginal people, Indigenous rock art, landscapes and expedition- related activities as well as non-Indigenous people, homesteads, pastoral stations, mining activities, plants, animals and geological features.A Different Time: The Expedition Photographs of Herbert Basedow 1903-1928, National Museum of Australia.

The majority of Basedow's photographs are in the National Museum of Australia collection. The South Australian Museum also has some photographs, and a small number are held by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. The Australian government purchased a large number of Basedow's photographs and Aboriginal artefacts in 1934. These were housed at the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra and became part of the National Historical Collection at the National Museum of Australia after the Institute of Anatomy closed in 1984. The collection consists of over 1000 Aboriginal artefacts and around 2200 photographic negatives.

She is a photo-journalist, and was created by Ubisoft developer Michel Ancel, with the goal of creating a character resembling a real person, rather than a \\"sexy action woman\\". In Beyond Good & Evil, she and her uncle Pey'j, a half-pig half-human, work together to both rescue orphans they were taking care of and expose governmental corruption. Since appearing in Beyond Good & Evil, Jade has been met with a very positive reception and has been included on several lists of top female video game characters. She has been compared to other such characters, including Alyx Vance from Half-Life 2. Concept and creation Jade was created by Beyond Good & Evil developer Michel Ancel, whose wife, Alexandra, a character artist for the game, played an important role in her creation. Beyond Good & Evil public relations manager Tyrone Miller stated that a rumor existed that she was the inspiration for Jade. Ancel set about creating a character that resembled a real person rather than a \\"sexy action woman\\", and Miller points out that the focus on Jade is on her role, situation, and the meaning of her actions in the game. Miller also describes her as a \\"girl next door\\" that people can identify with. The design of Jade evolved throughout the game's development, both in terms of her appearance and psychology. IGN editor Kaiser Hwang describes the change as going from an innocent girl with a tomboyish charm to a tougher, more weathered girl with multiple green-colored articles of clothing. While Jade has been cited as a black character, Miller states that she has no established ethnicity, since the game takes place on another planet. She is voiced by Jodie Forrest in English and Emma De Caunes in French.Voices (USA): Jodie ForrestVoices (FR): Emma De Caunes When asked who he felt should portray Jade in a hypothetical Beyond Good & Evil film, Miller chose Shannyn Sossamon, stating that she looks and walks similarly to Jade. In an interview with Nintendo Power, Ancel stated that he hopes Jade maintains her values and personality in Beyond Good and Evil 2. In an interview with Play, Ancel described Jade as having \\"a soul like a real person\\" rather than simply a puppet for the players to control. He noted the character's design was adapted during production, and attributed her personality to the game's dialogue, voice acting, and visuals \\"coming together\\". Appearances In Beyond Good and Evil, Jade lives in an island lighthouse with the boar-like Pey'j, caring for children orphaned by attacks on the planet by the DomZ, an aggressive alien race. While a skilled j≈çd≈ç martial artist, she is also a freelance journalist. When she runs out of money to power the lighthouse's shield generator, Jade takes a photography job cataloging all the animals on Hillys. She is then recruited by the IRIS Network, an anti-government resistance movement trying to expose a collaboration between the DomZ and Alpha Sections, an elite military group supposedly created to fight the DomZ. With her martial arts knowledge, she is able to infiltrate various government facilities and obtain evidence of human trafficking. After confronting the DomZ High Priest on Hillys' moon, she learns that she is known to the DomZ as \\"Shauni\\" (incidentally also her IRIS Network codename), and was bequeathed with a spiritual power stolen from them centuries ago. She subsequently uses that power to defeat the Priest and save the Hillyan populace. A Jade-like figure appears in a Beyond Good and Evil 2 teaser trailer, traveling with Pey'j. The same figure is also shown in a leaked development video from Ubisoft, escaping from a city. In addition, Jade's costume appears in the 2008 video game Prince of Persia for the character Elika. Reception Since her appearance in Beyond Good & Evil, Jade has been met with a positive reception, particularly for being attractive yet also tasteful. Fox News editor Lou Kesten cited Jade as an example of a heroine who isn't just eye candy for adolescent boys. IGN listed her as one of the top ten gaming heroines, describing her as \\"not your typical game character\\", and arguing that she is inquisitive, smart, brave, and fully clothed. IGN editor David Adams praised her ability to register pity or horror with the subtlest of changes in expression. GamesRadar listed her as one of the seventh most tasteful game heroines, stating that while she has a mastery of several disciplines that would take many years to accomplish, she comes off as a normal person, leaning more towards competence than eye candy. They also listed her as one of the top 20 most overlooked video game babes, stating that her \\"artsy-fartsy\\" nature and lack of upskirt potential is why she is so overlooked. They also described her as being inoffensive, with her outfit \\"nigh on asexual.\\" Play featured her in their first annual \\"Girls of Gaming\\" issue, praising her as the \\"ultimate thinking man's (and woman's) heroine.\\" GameDaily listed her as one of the top 25 hottest game babes, citing her as both tough and fashionable. They also listed her as one of the \\"10 babes who should meet your mom,\\" for being as \\"devoted,\\" and listed her in their \\"Babes of the Week: Brunettes\\" article, stating that she has a heart of gold. UGO.com listed her as the 46th hottest game babe, calling her \\"righteous.\\" San Francisco Chronicle editor Peter Hartlaub listed her as one of the top nine greatest video game heroines, describing her as tomboyish and a regular girl caught in the middle of a conflict. In 2013, Complex ranked her as the eight greatest heroine in video game history, and during a PAX Prime panel for game developers and journalists, Jade took top spot for best female character in an action game. 1UP.com also cited Jade favorably, stating that \\"her down to earth demeanor, athleticism, and adventurous spirit make Jade a capable character suited to any task in Beyond Good & Evil's dark political story.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Darren Franich listed her as one of \\"15 Kick-Ass Women in Videogames\\", describing her as \\"a badass female main character.\\" Jade has also been compared to other characters in video games. GamePro cited her as an example of the right way to do female video game characters, along with other female protagonists such as Portals Chell, Half-Life 2s Alyx Vance, and Silent Hill 3s Heather Mason. Kotaku editor Stephen Totillo compared her to Kendra Midori, protagonist of the Avatar video game, describing Midori as a \\"nature-loving scientist lady\\" while describing Jade as a \\"nature-loving photographer,\\" stating that she would feel at home in the world of Avatar. In an article discussing racial ambiguity in video games, Wired editor Chris Kohler uses Jade as an example of someone whose race is ambiguous, also bringing up a reader's blog post listing Jade in his list of black characters. This caused a \\"mini-controversy\\" on the NeoGAF forums, from which Kohler took statements as evidence of the ambiguity. He feels that the developers made Jade racially ambiguous, intending to allow players to see themselves in her.

According to Stuart C. Brown, in the pre-Hellenistic period, this mountain was apparently the main \\"east-west pass\\" through Mount Alvand. During the Achaemenid period, Ecbatana functioned as summer capital due to its high elevation and pleasant weather.

Chamberlain, the Colonel of the 20th Maine Infantry. Early life Thomas D. Chamberlain was born in Brewer, Maine, the youngest of five children. Young Tom grew up on the family farm in Brewer with his four older siblings: Joshua Lawrence (born in 1828), Horace Beriah (1834), Sarah Brastow (1836) and John Calhoun (1838). Their upbringing seems to have been strict and religious but also loving. Thomas was a mischievous and likable boy‚Äî-his brother called him a \\"little rogue\\"‚Äî-and, as the baby of the family, he was his mother's favorite. Thomas was the only son not to attend college. Whether this was due to lack of intelligence, application or inclination, is unknown. By his mid-teens Thomas was working as a clerk in a grocery store in Bangor. Civil War service Chamberlain's great-grandfathers were soldiers in the American Revolutionary War and his grandfather had served during the War of 1812. His father also had served during the abortive Aroostook War of 1839. His brother Joshua was also in the army. In 1862, Chamberlain joined the Union Army. His motives were mixed-- personal, patriotic, and religious. He was soon placed in the newly formed 20th Maine Infantry along with his brother Joshua, who was made Colonel of the regiment. The 20th Maine regiment marched to the Battle of Antietam, but did not participate in the fighting. They fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg, suffering light casualties in the assaults on Marye's Heights, but they were forced to spend a miserable night on the freezing battlefield among the many wounded and dead from other regiments. They missed the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863 due to an outbreak of smallpox in their ranks, which kept them on guard duty in the rear. In June 1863, Joshua was promoted to colonel of the regiment, after the promotion of its first colonel, Adelbert Ames, to brigade command. Thomas Chamberlain was involved in most of the other battles in which the 20th Maine fought, most notably the Battle of Gettysburg. =The Battle of Gettysburg= During the defense of Little Round Top, the 20th Maine came under heavy attack from the Confederate 15th Alabama regiment, part of the division led by Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood, and after about 3‚Äì4 hours of fighting the 20th Maine completely ran out of ammunition. Chamberlain's brother Joshua recognized the dire circumstances and ordered his left wing to respond to the rebels by charging downhill with fixed bayonets, thus ending the Confederate attack on the hill. The 20th Maine and the 83rd Pennsylvania together captured over 400 soldiers from the attacking Confederate forces. Joshua was slightly wounded in the foot by a spent bullet. Thomas was unhurt, except for \\"several scratches\\". As a result of their valiant defense of the hill, the Chamberlain brothers, Joshua Chamberlain especially, and the 20th Maine gained a great reputation and they were the subject of many publications and stories. =After Gettysburg= After Gettysburg, the major battles in which Thomas Chamberlain and the 20th Maine were involved were the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House and the Siege of Petersburg. At the Siege of Petersburg, the 20th Maine was in reserve, while Joshua (against his better judgment) led his Pennsylvania Bucktail brigade in a charge on a section of the Confederate defenses known as Rives's Salient. Turning to direct his troops, Joshua was struck by a mini√© ball, which entered just below his right hip, nicked his bladder and urethra, and stopped at his left hip. Such a devastating wound should have been fatal, and when he arrived at the field hospital, three miles behind the lines, his life was feared over. Thomas Chamberlain, back with his regiment, eventually heard the news. He and the surgeon of the 20th Maine, Dr. Abner O. Shaw, went to the hospital where Joshua was dying. As Thomas waited, Dr. Shaw, with Dr. Morris W. Townsend of the 44th New York, worked all night to try to save Joshua Chamberlain's life. Thirty-five years later, Joshua Chamberlain wrote that, after the surgeons had finished: \\"Tom stood over me like a brother, and such a one as he was.\\" Remarkably, Col. Chamberlain survived to enjoy his \\"on the spot\\" promotion to brigadier general, although he never returned to full fitness. A number of biographers of Joshua Chamberlain say that his life was saved through the activity of his brother, Thomas. =Appomattox Campaign= After Petersburg, Thomas Chamberlain and the 20th Maine were involved in the Battle of Five Forks (for which he was awarded Brevet Lieutenant Colonel for his bravery) and the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse. At the end of the war, the 20th Maine marched from Appomattox, Virginia, on May 2, reaching Washington, D.C., on May 12, where it was then finally mustered out of service on July 16, 1865. He ended the war with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Postbellum After the war, despite his distinguished military record, Chamberlain drifted from one job to another. He suffered from alcoholism as well as severe lung disease and heart disease. He died at age 55 in Bangor, Maine. In popular culture Chamberlain was a character in Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning historical novel, The Killer Angels. He was also portrayed in the movie based on that novel, Gettysburg, played by actor C. Thomas Howell, who repeated that role in the Gods and Generals prequel, based on the novel, Gods and Generals, written by Jeff Shaara, Michael Shaara's son. Chamberlain is portrayed in the two motion pictures as an energetic, youthful sidekick to his commander and older brother, Joshua Chamberlain (played by Jeff Daniels).

It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971 for its association with writer and literary critic William Dean Howells (1837‚Äì1920), a leading proponent of realism in literature. The Shingle Style house was designed by Howells' brother-in-law William Rutherford Mead, and served as the Howells' residence from its construction in 1877 to 1882. History The summer house was designed by William Rutherford Mead, brother of Mrs. (Elinor Mead) Howells,Lynn, Kenneth S. William Dean Howells: An American Life. New York: Harcout Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1970: 193. and a partner in the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & Bigelow. The following year Stanford White joined the firm, and it was renamed McKim, Mead & White.

But it was designed from the start for the Howellses' taste, with Mead's partner, Charles Follen McKim becoming more and more involved. Construction began in 1877, and the Howellses moved in on July 8, 1878.Goodman, Susan and Carl Dawson. William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005: 205.

Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 1999: 14. Howells experienced great literary success during his time at \\"Redtop.\\" By the end of the 1880s, he had published nine novels, a novella, several magazine articles, and a few plays.Goodman, Susan and Carl Dawson. William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005: 253. At \\"Redtop,\\" he worked in an elegant white-paneled study with a carved inglenook for naps. Here, he completed The Lady of The Aroostook (1879) and The Undiscovered Country (1880) and began writing A Woman's Reason (1883). He began The Rise of Silas Lapham in England, and completed it in 1885 while living at 302 Beacon Street in Boston.Levine, Meriam. A Guide to Writers' Homes in New England. Applewood Books, 1989: 178. Several other American authors visited \\"Redtop\\" during the period when the Howells family lived there. To judge from published letters, Mark Twain visited \\"Redtop\\" eight times. Other visitors included Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Henry James, and Charles Dudley Warner.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 27. Location and design The house sits on a large lot high atop Belmont Hill, looking out over Cambridge and Boston. It is built of brick and was originally clad in wood shingles in the Queen Anne style, with a large, sloping roof dominating the house as seen from the road beneath. The red roof that gave the house its nickname; is now covered in gray shingles. The exterior walls were later stripped of their wood shingles and covered with stucco. Novelist Henry James described the house as a \\"fairy abode of light and beauty\\" on its \\"cheerful, breezy hill . . . I never saw a house that took my fancy more captive at once by its tone of colour--as soon as I had entered the door; and every subsequent impression deepened the effect. All the details struck me as purely lovely, and when I looked from within outwards and over that incomparable landscape . . . I said to myself, 'Well, good fortune can no further go. Let silence muse the amount of it!' \\" Mead's architectural designs for \\"Redtop\\" are preserved in the Amherst College Archives.Five College Archives  See also  * William Dean Howells House (Cambridge, Massachusetts) * List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts References Further reading * Ginette de B Merrill, Redtop and the Belmont years of W.D.

In this game, both teams were undefeated, with Ohio State ranked first, and Michigan ranked fourth. A conference championship, Rose Bowl appearance, and possible national championship was on the line in this monumental game, part of the hotly contested stretch of the rivalry known as The Ten Year War. A then-NCAA record crowd of 105,233 watched the game at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor. With heavy rain prior to the game, the battle was mostly fought on the ground. Michigan had 90 yards passing and Ohio State attempted only four passing plays in a defensive contest. Ohio State failed to make a single first-down in the first quarter, but took an early 3‚Äì0 lead in the second quarter, with a 31-yard field goal by Blair Conway. Gil Chapman, Michigan's punt returner returned OSU's ensuing kick-off all the way to the OSU 27-yard line. A significant clipping penalty was called on Michigan which subsequently gave Michigan bad field position. With the way the game had gone, field position proved to be a huge advantage. After a series of punts, Ohio State got the ball on their own 45-yard line. Back-to- back Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin rushed for 41 yards on 5 carries, to get to 100 yards rushing, and OSU to the five-yard line. Fullback Pete Johnson busted his way through the defense for a touchdown just before the half to extend OSU's lead to 10‚Äì0. Michigan made defensive halftime adjustments in an attempt to crawl back into the game. The Wolverines outgained the Buckeyes 209‚Äì91 in total yardage in the 2nd half. Michigan took the 2nd half kick-off and marched all the way to the OSU 30-yard line. However, quarterback Dennis Franklin's pass was intercepted in the end zone ruining a productive drive. Midway through the third quarter, OSU faced a 4th and 2 on the Michigan 34-yard line, and decided to go for it. Their failed fourth down conversion gave Michigan new life, and much momentum. It is still looked on today as a controversial coaching call. Michigan engineered an 11 play drive, using the rushing ability of fullback Ed Shuttlesworth. The Wolverines kicked a field goal to get on the board, and make the score 10‚Äì3. Midway through the fourth quarter, Michigan's defense held, and the offense was able to start the tying drive with great field position. Dennis Franklin threw a 35-yard post-out pattern to tight end Paul Seal to get inside the red zone. Three consecutive Michigan offensive plays failed to get them a first down, and they were now faced with a fourth and inches on the ten-yard line. Ohio State loaded the box with nine defensive players, and focused on stopping Shuttlesworth, who had burned them the entire game. Franklin faked the inside hand-off to Shuttlesworth, and then slipped through the tackles running ten yards for a touchdown, to tie the score at 10-10. Michigan got the ball back with over six minutes to go for the game-winning drive, but had to start at their own ten- yard line. After a couple of completions to Clint Haslerig and some nice runs by Chapman and Shuttlesworth, Michigan made it into OSU territory. Franklin then threw a seven-yard pass play to Shuttlesworth and was injured, breaking his collar bone with 2:23 left in the game. Three plays later, Michigan kicker Mike Lantry attempted a 58-yard field goal, but the ball missed the left goal- post by a few inches. Ohio State took over, but back-up quarterback, Greg Hare, threw an interception that was returned to the OSU 33 with 52 seconds left. Michigan moved the ball to the OSU 28 before settling for a field goal on 3rd and 5 with 28 seconds to go. For the second consecutive try, the field goal was missed and the game ended in a 10‚Äì10 tie. Aftermath Michigan's coaches and players felt that although the game was a tie, that they were the better team and deserved to go to the Rose Bowl. Ohio State coach Woody Hayes said, ‚ÄúWe had to win this one to go and we didn't. If they vote Michigan, Michigan deserves to go.‚Äù. There was much to debate on who would play in the Rose Bowl as the best representative of the Big Ten Conference. Ohio State had gone to the Rose Bowl the year before. The Big Ten, alongside the Pacific-8, at the time had a longstanding policy stating that only the conference champion would reach postseason, and that game was the Rose Bowl, and neither conference allowed other teams to appear in postseason games. The Big Ten also had a rule prohibiting teams from appearing in consecutive Rose Bowls until 1971, and had it still been in effect, Michigan would have gone to the Rose Bowl automatically, even if it had lost the game to Ohio State. With the latter rule abolished, the decision as to who would represent the conference would be left up to a telephone vote by the Big Ten's athletic directors. According to Michigan coach Bo Schembechler's 1989 autobiography, the Big Ten was nervous because the conference had lost the previous four Rose Bowls, and Franklin's injury may have been a deciding factor.Schembechler, Glenn and Mitch Albom. Bo. Random House Value Publishing. 1989. On the day after the game, following a conference call, it was announced that Ohio State would play in the Rose Bowl instead of Michigan. Schembechler was furious at the call, referring to it as \\"an embarrassment to the Big Ten Conference\\" and claiming \\"petty jealousies\\" were involved.Pennington, John. The Ten-Year War: Ten Classic Games Between Bo and Woody. p. 113. Ulyssian Publications. , 2005. Schembechler went on to demand changes to the Big Ten's policies regarding post-season play. Schembechler was particularly bitter because his 1973 team did not lose a game and was not rewarded with a bowl assignment, and remained angry at the vote until his death in 2006. Schembechler also claimed the Franklin injury was just an excuse, since Michigan's strength was a running game and not a passing attack.Pennington. p. 114. It was rumored that Michigan State University voted for Ohio State in retaliation for Michigan's \\"no\\" vote in 1949 against admitting Michigan State to the Big Ten. There was also a rumor that Michigan State had voted for itself for the same reason. Neither of these charges were ever substantiated. For months afterward, Ohio newspapers would be flooded with letters from angry Wolverine fans, and threats of lawsuits. Schembechler said he had spoken with Illinois coach Bob Blackman, who said his athletic director, Cecil Coleman, would vote in favor of Michigan. Yet following the vote, it was revealed that Coleman had voted for the Buckeyes.Pennington. p. 116 Even if the vote were tied at 5-all, Michigan would have been awarded the berth since Ohio State had gone the year before. According to Tiebreaker, a 2013 Big Ten Network documentary dedicated to the 1973 contest, the Buckeyes were supported by Illinois, Northwestern, Purdue, Wisconsin, and possibly Michigan State; the Wolverines were supported by Indiana, Iowa, and Minnesota. Footage from the documentary had audio and printed admissions from Coleman, Iowa's Bump Elliott (Schembechler's predecessor at Michigan), Minnesota's Paul Giel, and Michigan State's J. Burt Smith, who told a crowd at an MSU football banquet on November 28, 1973 that he had voted for Ohio State because he felt they \\"best met the definition of the most representative team.\\"https://btn.com/tag/btn-tiebreaker/feed/ It is unknown whether then Big Ten commissioner Wayne Duke had influenced the vote in Ohio State's favor or not, although a 1973 investigation by the Big Ten Conference Faculty Representatives determined he did not. Until his death in 2017, Wayne Duke continued to vehemently deny that he influenced the vote in any way, saying the athletic directors followed the procedure in place and that he was merely the messenger. Ohio State ended up winning the 1974 Rose Bowl over USC by a score of 42-21, the Big Ten's lone Rose Bowl victory from 1970 through 1980. The next season, Ohio State defeated Michigan 12-10 at Columbus, necessitating a vote to determine the Rose Bowl participant. This time, there was no controversy when the Buckeyes prevailed. Ohio State lost the Rose Bowl 18-17 to USC. Michigan went 30-2-1 over the 1972, '73 and '74 seasons, but had zero bowl appearances to show for it. Among the changes that were made in the Big Ten Conference was, by 1975, to open postseason bids to four teams (since expanded to any team with six wins). This would allow conference teams other than the champion to accept invitations to other bowls. Michigan would be the first team to receive such an invite, to the Orange Bowl following the 1975 season, where it lost 14-6 to national champion Oklahoma. Another change, which also took effect in 1975, was the dropping of the athletic directors' vote in the event of a tie for the championship. The new rule stated the team which had gone the longest without appearing in the Rose Bowl would go to Pasadena. Schembechler had pushed for that reform, claiming that the athletic directors were not qualified to decide which team would better represent the conference in the Rose Bowl. That rule was changed following the institution of the conference championship game in 2011. The tie-breaker for that game is the head-to-head result.Pennington. p. 116. The tie denied Ohio State the national championship. Alabama vaulted the Buckeyes into the top spot in both polls, and the Crimson Tide finished the regular season 11‚Äì0 to earn the number one ranking in the UPI coaches poll, which did not conduct a post-bowl poll at that time. Notre Dame ended up as AP national champions by defeating Alabama 24‚Äì23 in the Sugar Bowl, leaving the Buckeyes second in both wire-service surveys. To this day, the aftermath of the 1973 Michigan-Ohio State contest remains one of the biggest controversies in college football history.

Its population is approximately 500. It is located on the Fraser River in the Robson Valley at the intersection of Yellowhead Highways 5 and 16. T√™te Jaune Cache is located 18 km north of Valemount, B.C., 101 km west of Jasper, Alberta, 241 km east of Prince George, B.C., and 332 km north of Kamloops, B.C., by road. History Foley, Welch and Stewart Cache in T√™te Jaune Cache 1913 T√™te Jaune Cache was named after a M√©tis fur trader and trapper named Pierre Bostonais who guided for the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1800s. Bostonais was nicknamed T√™te Jaune by the French voyageurs because of his blonde hair. (T√™te Jaune is French for yellow head.) The Secwepemc First Nations people had an established village of tents and pit houses on the banks of the Fraser in this area rich in salmon and wild berries when discovered by Bostonais, but the townsite land of T√™te Jaune Cache was officially located in 1901 and crown-granted (patented) in 1902. During the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway T√™te Jaune Cache was a prosperous community and was the head of navigation for the paddle steamers of Foley, Welch and Stewart and the BC Express Company. The town was a booming collection of lumber shacks, tents, and log houses which brought thousands of pioneers, trappers, prospectors, foresters, and entrepreneurs to the Robson Valley. Major industries in historic T√™te Jaune were timber, railways, steamship trade, and mining, especially for the locally abundant mica. Some of the largest and cleanest sheets of mica extracted in the era of its highest demand (for its usage in lanterns and stoves) came from this region, and the remains of one such mine can still be found on the popular Mica Mountain hiking trail. The pool halls, theatres, restaurants, jewellers, lady barbers, saloons, and trading posts are no more, with only a few stone chimneys remaining as evidence of this bustling town's existence, but the Valley Museum and Archives in McBride, as well as the Valemount Historical Society maintains an excellent collection of photographs from the heyday of this boom town, c. 1910-1918. Currently the area under the aegis of T√™te Jaune Cache is home to Hauer Brothers' Sawmill, as well as a few small businesses specializing in custom timber milling, woodworking, guided flyfishing, whitewater rafting, snowcat skiing, and bed and breakfast accommodation. In August 1916, the Simpcw people of the T√™te Jaune Cache were forcibly relocated out of the area to Chu Chua and other places. The people were made to travel the 300 kilometres by foot. In August 2016 events were held to mark the 100th anniversary of that event. The people of the Simpcw First Nation have made applications to the government to have lands at T√™te Jaune Cache formally recognized. Ecology T√™te Jaune Cache is an ecologically rich forest habitat for trees including Lodgepole pine, Trembling Aspen, Western red cedar, Paper birch and Douglas fir; wildlife such as Moose, Cougar, Wolverine, Black bears, Grizzly bears, Lynx, Beaver, and Marten. The shoals found where the McLennan River and T√™te Creek join the Fraser River are some of the most important spawning grounds for Chinook Salmon at the end of their annual 1,200 km run from the Pacific Ocean. These creeks, as well as Kiwa Creek to the north, are fed directly by meltwater from the glaciers and icefields of the Premier Range of the Cariboo Mountains. Transportation T√™te Jaune Cache lies at the junction between what was originally the Canadian Northern Railway transcontinental main line between Quebec City and Vancouver and the Grand Trunk Pacific line to Prince Rupert. Today both lines are part of the Canadian National Railway. Passenger service is provided by Via Rail's Jasper ‚Äì Prince Rupert train, which calls at the nearby Harvey Station on the Prince Rupert line. The community is also passed but not served by Via's transcontinental Canadian on the Vancouver line.

It extends from the Colorado border near the town of Kanorado to the Missouri border in Kansas City. The route covers and passes through several of the state's principal cities in the process including Kansas City, Topeka, and Salina. The route also passes through the cities of Lawrence, Junction City, and Abilene. Route description Interstate 70 in Kansas, Exit 1, Kanorado I-70 is concurrent with US-24 from the Colorado state line until US-24 splits at Levant and runs north of I-70. At Colby, I-70 begins to turn southeast until it reaches Oakley, where US-40 joins with I-70 for a concurrent journey through most of the state. Initially, the route remains high and unusually level as it follows a projection of the High Plains into the state. From Exit 140 (Riga Road), the route lowers from the High Plains into the Blue Hills region, as indicated by gentle undulations in the road and the unusual appearance of stone posts in the countryside. Approaching Russell, the route passes over three active sinkholes, the largest being the Crawford Sinkhole at Mile 179. Past Russell, the route follows a ridge between the Smoky Hill River and its tributary, the Saline River where the highway passes through the Smoky Hills Wind Farm. Reaching the county line between Russell and Ellsworth counties, the road begins to traverse the Smoky Hills. At Salina, Interstate 135 begins its journey southward toward Wichita, and I-70 continues through Abilene and Junction City, where the road begins to run through the Flint Hills. In Topeka, I-70 intersects a child route, I-470, twice. The second time it is intersected, the Kansas Turnpike merges, making I-70 into a toll road. This is one of only two sections of I-70 that are tolled (the other is along the Pennsylvania Turnpike), with the maximum toll distance costing $3.50 as of 2018. I-70 carries this designation from Topeka to Bonner Springs. It is the eastern terminus of the turnpike, and from there to 18th Street and extending on to the Kansas eastern border, the highway is free. Quality Hill. I-70 enters Missouri via a main northern route on the Lewis and Clark Viaduct above the confluence of the Kansas River and Missouri River and a route designated \\"Alternate I-70\\" which has signs for I-70 as well as Interstate 670 just south of Kansas City main downtown area. From Exit 275 at Abilene to the Missouri state line, the road is named the Dwight D. Eisenhower-Harry S. Truman Presidential Highway. It retains the designation until Exit 16 in Missouri at Independence, the location of Truman's presidential library.  History  The section of I-70 that is now the Kansas Turnpike was finished by 1956 and opened to traffic. West of Topeka, the freeway was constructed from Topeka west to Salina at its junction with U.S. Route 81, as well as from Ogallah to Grainfield. From Salina, the freeway was completed through Wilson the next year. A segment of I-70 from Levant through Ogallah was finished by 1965. Another section was built the following year connecting Wilson to Grainfield. The freeway was completed through Kansas with a last section near the Colorado border in 1970. Exit list Exit numbers correspond to the mileposts where they are located (numbered east from the Colorado border), except for those between Topeka and Kansas City, which are part of the Kansas Turnpike and use its mileposts (numbered nominally north from the Oklahoma border) instead. Auxiliary routes I-70 has two auxiliary routes in Kansas: * - a loop around the southern side of Topeka, signed as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Highway and overlapping the Kansas Turnpike on the southeast side of town. * - an alternate route for I-70 travelers through downtown Kansas City, signed as the Dillingham Freeway and as Alternate I-70.

He is best known for his performance of contemporary classical music. Mikhashoff studied at the Eastman School of Music, the Juilliard School, and the University of Houston, and received his doctorate in composition from the University of Texas in 1972. He also studied in France with Nadia Boulanger. He served as Professor of Music at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York from 1973 until his death from AIDS, in 1993, aged 52. From 1983 to 1991 he commissioned no fewer than 127 tangos for solo piano from 127 composers. Mikhashoff was considered one of the leading performers of contemporary piano music of his day. He worked closely with composers all over the world, including leading figures like John Cage, Morton Feldman, Giacinto Scelsi, Per N√∏rg√•rd, Poul Ruders, and numerous others. In addition to his performance schedule, he also did a lot of artistic advisory work, like working with Pierre Audi at the Almeida Festival in London, for many years the leading London venue for contemporary music programming, and likewise at the formation of the Music Factory festival in Bergen, Norway, with Geir Johnson. A complete archive of Mikhashoff's works is held by the Music Library of University at Buffalo Libraries at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. In 1996 the Yvar Mikhashoff Trust for New Music was established to support composers and performers of new music.

He was a son of Omer William Schietekat, a textile manufacturer, and Paula Sylvia Snoeck. In 1961, he married Maria Magdalena Vereecke (Myl√®ne), and together they had three children, a twin Jan and Paul in 1963 and in 1966 Sophie. He died in a car accident in Egem. Early life and education At the Nuns Catholic School in Berkenboom he was considered a mediocre student. He went to high school at the Sint- Lievenscollege in Antwerp and the Sint-Jozef Klein Seminarie in Sint-Niklaas, where he had Anton van Wilderode as a teacher. As a young boy he already showed interest in nature and painting. During the war his father earned a living making paintings that he sold to the local farmers or exchanged for food. For a while he studied law and philology at the University of Ghent. In 1955, together with Hugues C. Pernath, he founded the avant-garde journal the Gard Sivik (civil guard). Career After his military service in Germany (1956‚Äì1957) he decided to become a full-time artist, yet he soon changed his mind. He started working in his father's textile factory and visited several countries as a salesman. In 1963, he founded his own import - and export company of Japanese printed silk. Afterwards he became sales director in a company specialized in pile foundations. In 1967 he bought a farm in Slijpe and started to paint again in 1972, this time with more success. Several exhibitions followed. His paintings sold so well that he started working part- time for Atlas and then, in 1975, fully committed himself to painting. Paul Snoek became an editor of the Nieuw Vlaams Tijdschrift. In his free time he collected antiques and was an amateur motocross rider. He was a close friend of Gaston Burssens.

Cir. 2007), cert denied, 552 U.S. 1159 (2008) was resolved in early 2008 when the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the appeal. Their refusal left standing the appellate court decision, which said that patients have no right to \\"a potentially toxic drug with no proven therapeutic benefit.\\" Background Abigail Burroughs was a college student diagnosed with head and neck cancer. During the later phases of her treatment, Abigail's father, Frank Burroughs, formed an organization, the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs and sued the FDA for access to Erbitux. At that time, Erbitux was available experimentally only for patients participating in colon cancer clinical trials. The argument made by the Abigail Alliance in court was that terminal cancer patients have a constitutionally protected right to access to experimental medications before the FDA approves them. Specifically, the Abigail Alliance argued that the FDA should license drugs for use by terminally ill patients with \\"desperate diagnoses,\\" after they have completed Phase I testing. Abigal Alliance Citizen Petition to FDA If successful, the suit would have eliminated FDA prohibitions on selling unapproved drugs, and left the decision entirely in the hands of drug manufacturers. From its inception, the US Government has charged the FDA with a mission of overseeing testing of new drugs. Challenges to this core definition, as in the Abigail Alliance court case, would likely require broad changes to the FDA's operating mandate. Implementing the changes proposed by the Abigail Alliance would have exposed some terminally ill patients to treatments which would ultimately not be approved because of inefficacy and toxicity. The expected success rate of cancer drugs at the Phase I stage of clinical testing is 6%. If the Abigail Alliance had been successful in court, the suit would have radically altered the conduct of clinical cancer research, by providing almost unfettered legal access to experimental drugs by terminally ill patients, who would then have little incentive to enter Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, which are used to determine side effects and efficacy of new drugs. While eligibility factors and geography may limit the ability of some terminally ill patients to access new drugs through clinical trials, those trials also protect patients by collecting safety and efficacy data on new drugs under controlled circumstances. The von Eschenbach referred to in the case is Andrew von Eschenbach, Commissioner of the FDA from 2006 to 2009, and now a Director at BioTime, a biotechnology company. Progression of the case In May 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the Abigail Alliance and found that the US Constitution protects the right of terminally ill patients to access treatments that are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA requested that the Court of Appeals rehear the case. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals in advance of the March 1 hearing, supporting the FDA's position. ASCO proposed that the Constitution does not guarantee the right to access unapproved medications, and that the court case threatens the cancer clinical trial enterprise. Amicus brief by ASCO, filed February 2007 On March 1, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reheard the case en banc. On August 7, 2007, the Court issued an 8-2 decision against the Abigail Alliance, reversing the previous panel decision, thereby upholding the previous court decision that found no constitutional right to unapproved drugs by terminally ill patients. Judge Judith Rogers and Chief judge Douglas Ginsburg dissented. Frank Burroughs, Abigail's father, vowed to pursue an appeal to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court declined to accept the case, which effectively ended the case with the existing FDA regulations intact.

In the early 1970s, Duke Power started construction on a three-reactor nuclear power plant at the site. However, the project stalled due to economic problems by the early 1980s, leading to the project's eventual abandonment. In 1987, the power plant was the site of an underwater film studio built by Hollywood director James Cameron, for the film The Abyss. On December 13, 2007, Duke Energy filed an application with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to construct a new $5‚Äì6 billion two-unit nuclear power plant at William States Lee III Nuclear Generating Station near the Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant site. In November 2008 the estimated cost to complete the project was raised to $11 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). Original plant Duke originally planned three reactors on the property. One reactor was partially completed when work was halted in 1982 and they scrapped plans for the other two. Duke halted construction at the site in 1983 after spending $633 million ($ billion in ). An uncertain economy, stringent federal regulations on nuclear plants and a decrease in electrical use caused Duke Power to abandon the site in the early 1980s. The Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) for each unit was planned to be a pressurized water reactor manufactured by Combustion Engineering, Inc. The reactor fuel was planned to be zircaloy clad uranium dioxide with a maximum enrichment of 3.6 wt. percent. The NSSS would have had a guaranteed main steam flow of /hr., a warranted output of 3817 MWt, and a design point of 4018 MWt. The turbine generators were planned to be manufactured by General Electric. Each was planned to have a gross rated electrical output of 1,345 MW and a gross valves-wide-open (VWO) electrical output of 1,387 MW. By 1988, Earl Owensby, a Shelby, N.C. businessman, had converted the former energy complex into a movie studio. The Abyss In 1987, director James Cameron debated whether to actually film in the ocean or on a film set during the process of writing his screenplay for The Abyss. He ultimately chose to film in a man-made environment due to the need to control dangers, cost and filming environment. Cameron decided to use Cherokee Nuclear Power plant facility to film the underwater sequences involving the submerged drilling rig. =Filming= The turbine pit, which was a large irregularly-shaped structure, was modified to hold of water. But when cinematographer Al Giddings visited the site he found the potential tank was still not quite large enough for the production's needs. Cameron then investigated the original containment vessel for the reactor chamber, a cylindrical structure across, deep. Following modifications, this vessel was converted into a vat able to hold of water. This containment vessel became \\"A\\" tank while the smaller turbine pit was the \\"B\\" tank. \\"B\\" tank was used for all the interiors of the submarine, the Sub Bay set and for the \\"wet-for-wet\\" miniature work. The \\"A\\" tank was used for the main exterior of Deepcore and for the full-sized exterior Montana missile deck section. (The Deepcore structure is visible in the pre-2007 Historical Imagery views on Google Earth.) The water depth and length of time spent submerged meant that the cast and crew had to endure decompression treatments. Interior sets for Deepcore as well as other production sets were built inside the nearby warehouses on the site. =Location= In December 1988, production moved to Los Angeles. After the completion of filming the tanks were drained but the sets were not removed. Before abandoning the set, warning labels were affixed on the structures stating that the sets remained the property of 20th Century Fox and that any photographic or video recording was not allowed. The Abyss sets were demolished in September 2007. New Nuclear Power Plant On December 13, 2007, Duke Power announced that this site had been selected for a new nuclear power plant to be called the William States Lee III Nuclear Generating Station. The site is owned by Duke Energy. Duke planned to develop the site for two Westinghouse Electric Company AP1000 (advanced passive) pressurized water reactors. Each reactor would have been capable of producing approximately 1,117 megawatts. Plant construction on the site could take five years. The property still has cooling ponds and infrastructure in place, making it more attractive than other sites in the region.

Early life Becke was born at Port Macquarie, New South Wales, son of Frederick Becke, Clerk of Petty Sessions and his wife Caroline Matilda, n√©e Beilby. Both parents were born in England. Becke was the ninth of twelve children and had a tendency to wander; he has stated that before he was 10 he had twice run away from home. The family moved to Hunters Hill, Sydney in 1867 and Becke was educated at Fort Street High School. In 1869, Becke travelled to San Francisco with his brother William Vernon and was away for nineteen months. At 16 years of age, Becke was a stowaway on a ship bound for Samoa. In Apia he took a job as a book-keeper in the store of Mrs Mary Mcfarlane which he held until some time after December 1872. Under orders of Mrs Mcfarlane, Becke sailed a ketch, the E.A. Williams to Mili Atoll to deliver it to William \\"Bully\\" Hayes, the notorious blackbirder. Beck arrived at Mili Atoll on 17 January 1874. Becke remained as a passenger on the Leonora, until the ship was wrecked on 15 March 1874 during a storm while in Lele harbour at Kosrae. It was seven months until HMS Rosario rescued Becke and the others. Becke was later arrested for piracy, but was acquitted in Brisbane at age 19. Then he tried his luck at the Palmer River goldrush, was employed at Ravenswood station and from 1878‚Äì79 worked as a bank clerk in Townsville, Queensland. The story Nell of Mulliner's Camp is set in a mining camp in North Queensland. From about April 1880 Becke was in the Ellice Islands (now Tuvalu) working with the Liverpool firm of John S. de Wolf and Co. on Nanumanga until the trading-station was destroyed later that year in a cyclone. In February 1881 he opened his own store in Nukufetau, where he married Nelea Tikena. The stories that Louis Becke set in the Ellice Islands are: The Fisher Folk of Nukufetau that describes a fishing expedition, The Rangers of the Tia Kau that describes a shark attack at the Tia Kau reef between Nanumea and Nanumanga, and Kennedy the Boatsteere that describes an attempt by a trader on Niutao to escape with a woman betrothed to a Niutaon chief, which ends in tragedy. Later in 1881 a shipwreck on Beru Island in the Gilbert Islands caused him to lose all he had; Becke then worked in New Britain and was in Majuro by November 1882. For the next ten years Becke moved about the Gilbert Islands, Ellice Islands, Caroline Islands and Marshall Islands acquiring a knowledge of the customs and beliefs of the islanders and meeting palagi traders and beachcombers that Becke later used his stories. Becke wrote about Bully Hayes in The Strange Adventures of James Shervintonhttps://archive.org/details/strangeadventur00beckgoog and other stories: Captain \\"Bully\\" Hayes; Concerning \\"Bully\\" Hayes; The Wreck Of The Leonora: A Memory Of \\"Bully\\" Hayes. However these stories must be read with caution as the line between fact and fiction-writing is unclear. Becke's experiences in the Pacific provided most of the material for Becke's stories. Becke's earliest writing on Hayes was published, without attribution to Becke, in the novel A Modern Buccaneer (1894), which was published by Thomas Alexander Browne under the pseudonym 'Rolf Boldrewood'. Browne was the author of Robbery Under Arms and paid Becke for his recollections of \\"Bully\\" Hayes. Following publication of A Modern Buccaneer, Becke wrote to Browne protesting at the use of his manuscript without any significant change, and without attribution of Becke's contribution of the manuscript. Becke returned to New South Wales late in 1885 and on 10 February 1886 married Mary Elizabeth (Bessie) Maunsell, the daughter of Colonel Maunsell, of Port Macquarie. On 9 November 1888 his daughter, Nora Lois, was born. On 9 June 1896 he left Sydney for London with Nora Lois and Miss Fanny Sabrina Long. Becke and Fanny Long had 2 daughters, Alrema (born 30 October 1897) and Niya (born 27 September 1898). Bessie obtained a divorce on the grounds of desertion on 29 October 1903. In 1908 he and his family went to Auckland, New Zealand, via Fiji; then in 1909 the family travelled to Sydney, Australia. On 7 September 1910 he was elected a member of the Royal Society of New South Wales. He died on 18 February 1913 at the Hotel York in Sydney and was buried in the Waverley Cemetery near to the graves of Henry Lawson and Henry Kendall. Literary career In January 1892 Becke returned to Sydney and persuaded by Ernest Favenc and J. F. Archibald began to contribute stories to The Bulletin, the first of which was 'Tis in the Blood appearing in the edition of 6 May 1893. A collection of these stories, By Reef and Palm, was published in England in 1894; His Native Wife, a novelette, was published in Australia in 1895; followed by a further collection of stories, The Ebbing of the Tide, which was published in 1896. Becke went to London about the beginning of 1896, helped by Archibald and William Macleod of The Bulletin who advanced him the sum of ¬£200, and he remained in Europe for around 15 years, during which time a large number of collections of short stories and a few novels and stories for boys were published. Becke was fairly paid by the magazines for his stories, but his books were always sold outright and never on a royalty basis, he was not a wealthy man. His writings were of variable quality, but have been compared to Rudyard Kipling, Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad and Robert Louis Stevenson. Late life and legacy Becke was in Sydney again in the middle of 1909 and died of cancer there on 18 February 1913, working up until his death. About 30 of Becke's books are listed in E. Morris Miller's Australian Literature with six other volumes written in collaboration with Walter J. Jeffrey. He was survived by his wife and a daughter. Becke had said that any literary success he had achieved was due entirely to the training received from the editor of The Bulletin, J. F. Archibald, \\"who taught me the secrets of condensation and simplicity of language\\"Bulletin, 27 Feb 1913. Once having learned this, Becke had a wealth of experience to draw upon and, though there was inevitably some monotony of theme, he wrote a very large number of stories that can still be read with interest, and show him to have been a writer of considerable ability. By Reef and Palm and Ebbing of the Tide received both good reviews and strong sales; with By Reef and Palm going through seven reprints between 1894 and 1924. Almost all of Becke's works were published in America by J. B. Lippincott of Philadelphia. Becke was criticised by some reviewers for lapses in grammar and taste. His Native Wife was unfavourably received in America because of its subject matter; J. B. Lippincott also refused to publish The Mutineer: A Romance of Pitcairn Island.

The school was designated as a Business and Enterprise College by the Department for Education and Skills when it was formerly called Stanley Technical High School. The re-development of the school was finished in November 2007 as part of the renaming. The school belongs to a federation of schools in South London called the Harris Federation named after Philip Harris, Baron Harris of Peckham, the chairman of Carpetright plc. The school is co-educational, changing its status from boys-only which it had been since the school was founded in 1907. In September 2014, the school amalgamated with Harris Academy Upper Norwood, sharing teachers and a sixth form campus.  Location  The school is located in South Norwood on both the High Street and South Norwood Hill.  History  Harris Academy South Norwood is on the site formerly occupied by The Stanley Technical School for Boys which was founded by William Ford Stanley in 1907 as a trade school (initially called Stanley Technical Trade School). Unlike William Stanley who fully paid for the construction of the school that took his name, it is widely believed that Phil Harris actually contributed in cash terms far less than one million pounds to take control and ownership of the state school. In order to recognise the change and renewal of this school, Phil Harris, Croydon Council and the local community of South Norwood agreed that it should be called the Harris Academy at Stanley. In 2006 Harris changed his mind and unilaterally decided that the school should be called the Harris Academy South Norwood. Until Harris went back on his agreement to protect the heritage and culture of South Norwood with the name 'Harris at Stanley' this school scheme was very popular in the community, unlike in Merton where local parents have been up in arms about the conversion of their local school into a Harris Academy. = Features = The Harris Academy includes a new sixth form for 300 pupils offering academic and vocational subjects. At a cost of ¬£32,000,000 overall, the facilities consist of: *A new building *Drama facilities *Art and Design studios *Smartboards across all departments  Harris Federation  The Harris Federation, is a federation of schools in South London.

It is owned by Communicorp and operated by Global as part of the Smooth network of stations. As well as being carried on FM in the East Midlands, the station could also be found on DAB digital radio and online. It was also broadcast on the NOW Derbyshire DAB Multiplex.  History  The station came into existence following GMG Radio's purchase of the Saga Radio Group in December 2006, and the granting of permission from the regulator Ofcom to change the format of its Smooth FM stations. The decision was made to change both the Smooth FM and Saga stations to Smooth Radio. Saga 106.6 FM closed at 6pm on Friday 23 March 2007, and was followed by a preview weekend for the new Smooth Radio. Smooth East Midlands played middle-of-the-road, adult contemporary music, aimed at listeners aged 45 and over. It had very few similarities to its predecessor. Though many of the presenters who worked on Saga 106.6 FM initially hosted shows on 106.6 Smooth Radio, many later departed and by the time of its closure none of the specialist shows from the Saga days had survived. Moreover, Smooth's initial slogan Your Life, Your music, which was used on Saga stations, was modified to Love Life, Love Music, which continues to be used by the station's successor. The station gradually networked many of its programmes since 2007, and from 28 June 2010 Tony Lyman was the only remaining original presenter from the Saga line up. Local programming originated from studios in Nottinghamshire. Networked programming was syndicated from Smooth North West studios at Salford Quays, Manchester. In 2010 GMG announced that it would be merging its five Smooth stations in England to create a nationwide Smooth Radio service based in Manchester. The new station was launched on 4 October 2010 and could be heard both on DAB and on the locally on the FM frequencies. =Global Radio franchisee under Communicorp ownership= Smooth Radio's output was relocated to new owner Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October 2013, a move that coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. Global reached an agreement to sell Smooth East Midlands and seven others to Communicorp, as part of a plan to allay competition fears following Global's purchase of GMG Radio. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and to replace it with a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 2 March 2014 a new slogan Your Relaxing Music Mix was introduced. In September 2019, following OFCOM's decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Smooth's local Drivetime and weekend shows were replaced by network programming from London.Smooth Radio poaches Angie Greaves for national Drive, Radio Today, 29 May 2019 Local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained, alongside the station's East Midlands breakfast show.

Biography =Early life= A self-taught writer, director and photographer from Portland, Oregon, DeRouchie began painting in high school and progressed to photography due to the frustration she felt at the inability to capture what she saw. After a couple years, photography progressed into a desire to capture what she saw in moving form, including stage direction and film. =Film career= She first received major attention as a 2001 Project Greenlight semi-finalist with her feature-length script The Frank Principle. In 2002, she directed a 20-minute short film adaptation of scenes from The Frank Principle, which premiered at the Split.ID Film Festival in Hollywood in January 2003. In 2003, she directed Rick Emerson's one-man stage show, Bigger Than Jesus: The Diary of a Rock and Roll Fan, which debuted to a sold-out, standing-room-only audience that summer and was later returned for a successful run in 2004. She combined with Rick Emerson again on a short thriller called Remote Control, which played in 2004 at both the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival and the Portland Underground Film Festival. In 2005, DeRouchie worked with Emerson in the DVD production of Bigger Than Jesus, which was performed at Portland State University's Lincoln Hall. Later in 2005, she produced a two-part television pilot with Emerson called Rock Roundtable which aired on a local station. She produced the documentary, I Was a Teenage Dirtbag.

It is known for its association with Lewis Carroll who is commemorated in its stained glass windows depicting characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The church is an active Church of England parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Great Budworth. The author Lewis Carroll was born in All Saints' Vicarage in 1832 when his father, Charles Dodgson, was perpetual curate at the church. This was commemorated in March 2012 when the Lewis Carroll Centre, attached to the church, was opened. History In the 12th century a chapelry was founded on the site of the present church as a daughter house of Norton Priory.All Saints' Church, Daresbury, Church booklet It was a chapel of ease within the parish of Runcorn. After the Reformation the patronage of the Runcorn parish passed into the hands of Christ Church, Oxford. It is likely that the stone tower was built shortly after this time. Over the years there were frequent disputes between the worshippers at Daresbury and the mother church at Runcorn relating to financial matters. Other than the tower, the church was largely rebuilt between 1870 and 1872 by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. They lengthened the church, extended the clerestory to the east, and added a new north porch and vestry, at a cost of ¬£6,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). During the restoration an old rood loft and screen were destroyed. Richards identified this as of \\"pure Welsh type\\" and its loss as \\"nothing short of a major calamity\\". Daresbury became a parish separate from Runcorn in February 1880. Families who have been associated with the church over the centuries are those of Greenall, Rylands, Chadwick, Heron, Milner, Houghton, and Okell. The tower was restored in 1872 by Sir Gilbert Greenall. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in red sandstone with a slate roof. The architectural style of the body of the church is Perpendicular. The plan of the church consists of a five-bay nave with north and south aisles, a tower at the west at end of the nave, and entrances opposite each other in the north and south aisles. The tower has corner buttresses and is crenellated. On its top is a weather vane in the shape of a fish. The west window is plain with four lights and the belfry windows are also plain with two lights. The date 1110 is carved on the south side. It is thought that this date was originally 1550 but that the number had weathered and it was mistaken by restorers. At the east end of the south aisle is the Daniell Chapel. The chapel had formerly been called the Chadwick Chapel but its name was changed to the Daniell chapel to commemorate one of Cheshire's ancient families who had connections with Daresbury. =Interior= Inside the church, the arcades are carried on plain octagonal columns. The pulpit is Jacobean with carvings of heads of angels which Richards considers to be possibly the most elaborate of their kind in the county. It also includes a carving similar to the griffin in Alice's Adventures. The font dates from the 19th century and was the gift of Miss Elizabeth Wood. Its elaborate wooden cover was given by Lady Greenall. There is a green man carved in the re-used Jacobean rood screen behind the altar. The oak bench ends are carved with \\"inventive tracery-work\\". In the belfry is a board with an acrostic on the name \\"Daresbury\\". The Nativity window commemorating Lewis Carroll The stained glass in the windows of the south aisle depict the eleven apostles without Judas Iscariot. They were donated in the middle of the 19th century by the Stubbs family, industrialists in Warrington. The east window of the Daniell chapel includes characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The window was erected following a memorial fund to celebrate the centenary of Carroll's birth in 1935. It was designed by Geoffrey Webb and dedicated on 30 June 1935 by Herbert Gresford Jones, Bishop of Warrington. The upper panels depict a nativity scene surmounted by eight angels, the leftmost panel showing Lewis Carroll himself accompanied by Alice Liddell. The windows incorporate symbolic panels relating to Carroll's life, including the Cheshire wheatsheaf, the arms of Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford, and mathematical instruments. Across the base of the window are five panels which include characters from the Alice books together with words from Carroll's poem Christmas Greetings. The characters are based on the illustrations by John Tenniel. On the south wall are windows designed by Trena Cox depicting The Flight into Egypt and The Annunciation which were donated to the church in 1960 in memory of the Broome family of Preston-on-the-Hill. On the south wall of the church is a memorial by John Gibson which was preserved from the old church. It commemorates Sarah, wife of Henry Byrom of Liverpool, who died in 1833. Elsewhere in the church are memorials to Radulphus Starkie who died in the 17th century, to Rebecca Rutter, who died in 1725, and a memorial by E. Ashworth to Henry Byrom, who died in 1804. In the chancel is a memorial to George Heron, a canon of Chester Cathedral who baptised Lewis Carroll. Also in the chancel are two brasses to members of the Greenall family who died in 1861 and 1867. In the Daniell chapel are memorials to members of the Chadwick family of Daresbury Hall. The two-manual organ was built by Jardine and restored in 2002 by A. J. Carter. There is a ring of eight bells, all of which were cast by John Warner and Sons in 1913. The parish registers date from 1617, and the churchwardens' accounts from 1663. External features The churchyard contains a 16th-century font in which, amongst many others, Lewis Carroll was baptised. Also in the churchyard are the war graves of two soldiers and a Royal Navy schoolmaster of World War I. Lewis Carroll Centre The centre consists of a semicircular sandstone structure with tall windows attached to the north of the church and approached through the north door. On the walls are descriptive panels giving information about Charles Dodgson, Lewis Carroll, and other members of the family. Hanging in the room is the meeting bell that formerly called canal people to worship in the floating mission church at Preston Brook on the nearby Bridgewater Canal. The centre also serves as a meeting room for schools and other groups. The church and centre are open every day, and there is no admission charge.

It presents a snapshot of the early 1980s Belgrade underground music scene through bands Radniƒçka Kontrola, Bezobrazno Zeleno, Profili Profili, Defektno Efektni, Urbana Gerila, Petar i Zli Vuci, U ≈†kripcu, Pasta ZZ, VIA Talas and TV Moroni, all of whom took part in the compilation as means of showcasing their material to a wider audience.  Background  The album was released by Jugoton as a followup to the hugely successful Paket aran≈æman that presented three Belgrade bands Idoli, ≈†arlo Akrobata and Elektriƒçni Orgazam, which, after the compilation release, quickly gained mainstream popularity. Still, despite employing a similar concept, Artistiƒçka radna akcija never managed to replicate the critical and commercial success of its predecessor. The compilation was recorded in Druga Maca studio during April and May 1981 and, like Paket aran≈æman, was also produced by Enco Lesiƒá. The compilation featured the U ≈†kripcu tracks surf spaghetti western \\"Pamflex dom\\" and ska / reggae oriented \\"Ju≈æno voƒáe\\", which became minor hits, along with Bezobrazno Zeleno tracks \\"Be≈æim niz ulicu\\" and \\"Beograd\\", and the seven piece band Petar i Zli Vuci tracks \\"Ogledalo\\" and \\"Kozaci\\", which were also released on single.

Bezobrazno Zeleno released two studio albums, Profili Profili released a split album with Kazimirov Kazneni Korpus, Petar i Zli Vuci released two singles, U ≈†kripcu had several studio releases and gained mainstream popularity moving to synthpop, and VIA Talas released one studio album before disbanding in 1982. Unlike Paket aran≈æman, which featured three young acts that almost immediately became critically acclaimed, even commercially successful, each one of the ten bands on Artistiƒçka radna akcija (with the exception of U ≈†kripcu) remained largely obscure. Still, many of the individuals who took part in Artistiƒçka radna akcija found success in other bands, other forms of artistic expression or other professions altogether, such as: *Radniƒçka Kontrola members: vocalist Zoran \\"Cane\\" Kostiƒá who formed the popular garage punk band Partibrejkers, and drummer Srƒëan Todoroviƒá who later played with Disciplina Kiƒçme, Ekatarina Velika and Kazna Za U≈°i, and in parallel started a successful acting career *VIA Talas members: Bojan Peƒçar who joined Ekatarina Velika and Mi≈°ko \\"Plavi\\" Petroviƒá who joined the popular synthpop duo D' Boys *Urbana Gerila members: Nenad \\"Kele\\" Krasavac who joined Disciplina Kiƒçme, Branislav \\"Kebra\\" Babiƒá who formed the alternative rock band Obojeni Program.

In the years since its release, Artistiƒçka radna akcija has managed to gain some slightly wider recognition as a referential work that endeared itself to many, and, along with Novi Punk Val and Paket aran≈æman, is considered an important symbol of the Yugoslav new wave era and the former Yugoslav punk scene. The record today is a rarity and a collectors item and has a cult status in the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia. The album was re-released on CD in July 2014.

The only non-Goldenthal piece is an old Italian song called \\"Vivere\\" performed by Italian singer Carlo Buti. The Score It is extremely experimental, like all of his other work, and the first piece \\"Victorius Titus\\" is reminiscent of The Imperial March by John Williams in its imposing, martial nature, and (unlike imperial march) in addition uses an archaic male choir chanting in Latin. The score blends orchestral, jazz, rock and electronica styles and complements Taymor's unique and off-beat adaptation of the Shakespearean play. In keeping with many other Goldenthal scores the orchestra used was the British London Metropolitan Orchestra. The score also contains samples from earlier Goldenthal scores, the most glaring being a reworked version of \\"Wreckage and Rape\\" from the soundtrack to Alien 3, which plays during the dinner table fight scene.http://www.planetavp.com/amr/html/music/music.html The score, according to Goldenthal himself, sums up his film scoring career up to that point; \\"This score is a culmination of my style.

This genus only contains a single species: Sibbaldiopsis tridentata, formerly Potentilla tridentata. Commonly, its names include three-toothed cinquefoil, shrubby fivefingers, and wineleaf. Systemic phylogenetic work has placed S. tridentata within Sibbaldia as Sibbaldia retusa.  History  Sibbaldiopsis tridentata was first described by William Aiton, but later corrected by Per Axel Rydberg. The species had been called Potentilla tridentata, but because of genetic analysis, it was discovered that the plant was closer to the boreal species Sibbaldia procumbens, and was placed in its own genus. The genus name Sibbaldiopsis comes from Sibbaldia and the suffix , meaning \\"resembling\\". Sibbaldiopsis tridentata has sometimes been cited as Potentilla retusa, as it is much older, despite having yellow flowers. In addition, poor specimens of Sibbaldiopsis tridentata resemble Sibbaldia procumbens more than Sibbaldiopsis tridentata itself.  Habitat  Sibbaldiopsis tridentata prefers dry and acidic soil, usually on rocky or gravelly shores that have access to a lot of sun. It is often found on shale outcrops. The species is located all over the central to eastern American states, with disjunct populations extending down the Appalachian Mountains. The species also lives in the Canadian provinces east of and including Alberta, as well as Greenland. In Nova Scotia, the species is very common in the center of the Annapolis Valley and around cliffs or rocky outcrops. The southernmost known populations are located in Georgia and North Carolina, and occupy high-elevation rock outcrops and grassy balds. Sibbaldiopsis tridentata is listed as endangered in 5 US states.  Characteristics  Sibbaldiopsis tridentata is a short evergreen perennial plant, growing up to ten inches. Its leaves are compound and trifoliate, usually growing at the base in an alternating pattern, each leaflet growing up to an inch-and-a-half in length and a half-an-inch across. The leaflets are oblanceolate with a truncated tip having three teeth. The leaves are glossy and evergreen. They turn deep red in fall if the plants are grown in sun. Its branches are herbaceous and pubescent, but its roots are woody. Its flowers are small and white, radial, and arranged in a compound bracteate cyme, having five sepals and five petals with several stamens and a few pistils. The individual flowers resemble flowers from the genus Potentilla. Its blooming period lasts two to three months, between June to August. Eventually, the triangular sepals fold up and tiny, hairy brown seeds develop inside them.

Early history of rodeo Branding calves, 1888. Many rodeo events were based on the real life tasks required by cattle ranching Rodeo stresses its western folk hero image and its being a genuinely American creation. But in fact it grew out of the practices of Spanish ranchers and their Mexican ranch hands (vaqueros), a mixture of cattle wrangling and bullfighting that dates back to the sixteenth- century conquistadors. Bullriding originated with Mexican equestrian contests known as charreadas. wrestling the steer to the ground by riding up behind it, grabbing its tail, and twisting it to the ground.LeCompte, Mary Lou, \\"The Hispanic Influence on the History of Rodeo, 1823-1922,\\" Journal of Sport History, 12 (Spring 1985): 23. Guarner, Enrique, Historia del Torreo en Mexico, (Mexico, Editorial Diana, 1979; \\"Historical Synthesis of Charreria,\\"Artes de Mexico 90/91, 1967; Steiner, Stan, Dark & Dashing Horsemen, Harper & Row, 1981; Slatta, Richard, Cowboys of the Americas, Yale University Press, 1990. Bull wrestling had been part of an ancient tradition throughout the ancient Mediterranean world including Spain. The ancient Minoans of Crete practiced bull jumping, bull riding, and bull wrestling. Bull wrestling may have been one of the Olympic sports events of the ancient Greeks. The events spread throughout the Viceroyalty of New Spain and was found at fairgrounds, racetracks, fiestas, and festivals in nineteenth century southwestern areas that now comprise the United States. However, unlike the roping, riding, and racing, this contest never attracted a following among Anglo cowboys or audiences.LeCompte, \\"Hispanic Influence, 23-30. It is however a favorite event included in the charreada, the style of rodeo which originated in the Mexican state of Jalisco. There would probably be no steer wrestling at all in American rodeo were it not for a black cowboy from Texas named Bill Pickett who devised his own unique method of bulldogging steers. He jumped from his horse to a steer's back, bit its upper lip, and threw it to the ground by grabbing its horns. He performed at local central Texas fairs and rodeos and was discovered by an agent, who signed him on a tour of the West with his brothers. He received sensational national publicity with his bulldogging exhibition at the 1904 Cheyenne Frontier Days. This brought him a contract with the famous 101 Ranch in Oklahoma and its traveling Wild West exhibitions, where he spent many years performing in the United States and abroad. Pickett attracted many imitators who appeared at rodeos and Wild West shows, and soon there were enough practitioners for promoters to stage contests.LeCompte. \\"Bill Pickett,\\" in Encyclopedia of the American West, ed. Alan Axelrod and Charles Phillips, Macmillan Reference USA. 1996, Vol.3, pp.1291-1292; LeCompte,. \\"Pickett, William,\\" in Vol. 5 of The Handbook of Texas, Austin: Texas State Historical Association, 1996, 191; \\"The Story of The Billboard, and Col. W. T. Johnson's Rodeos,\\" The Billboard, 29 October 1934, 75. Photographers such as Walter S. Bowman and Ralph R. Doubleday captured images of rodeos and published postcards of the events. The first woman bulldogger appeared in 1913, when the great champion trick and bronc rider and racer Tillie Baldwin exhibited the feat.LeCompte. \\"Tillie Baldwin: Rodeo‚Äôs Original Bloomer Girl\\", in International Encyclopedia of Women and Sports\\" ed., Karen Christensen, Allen Guttmann, and Gertrud Pfister, Macmillan Reference USA, 2001, 939. However, women's bulldogging contests never materialized. But cowboys did take up the sport with enthusiasm but without the lip-biting, and when rodeo rules were codified, steer wrestling was among the standard contests.LeCompte, Hispanic Influence, 37; Wayne S. Wooden, and Gavin Earinger, Rodeo, in America, Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1996, pp. 20-21. Two halls of fame recognize Bill Pickett as the sole inventor of bulldogging, the only rodeo event which can be attributed to a single individual.National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum,\\" Rodeo Inductees and Honorees: Bill Pickett,\\" sv: ( accessed February 13, 2007); e-mail, Tanna Kimble (Prorodeo Hall of Fame) to LeCompte, February 12, 2007 Rodeo itself evolved after the Texas Revolution and the U.S.-Mexican War when Anglo cowboys learned the skills, attire, vocabulary, and sports of the vaqueros. Ranch- versus-ranch contests gradually sprang up, as bronc riding, bull riding, and roping contests appeared at race tracks, fairgrounds, and festivals of all kinds. William F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) created the first major rodeo and the first Wild West show in North Platte, Nebraska in 1882. Following this successful endeavor, Cody organized his touring Wild West show, leaving other entrepreneurs to create what became professional rodeo. Rodeos and Wild West shows enjoyed a parallel existence, employing many of the same stars, while capitalizing on the continuing allure of the mythic West. Women joined the Wild West and contest rodeo circuits in the 1890s and their participation grew as the activities spread geographically. Animal welfare groups began targeting rodeo from the earliest times, and have continued their efforts with varying degrees of success ever since.LeCompte, Hispanic Influence, 37; Wooden, and Earinger, Rodeo, in America, 7-16 and 125-134; Kristine Fredriksson, American Rodeo, Texas A&M; University Press (1985),134-170 The word rodeo was only occasionally used for American cowboy sports until the 1920s, and professional cowboys themselves did not officially adopt the term until 1945. Similarly, there was no attempt to standardize the events needed to make up such sporting contests until 1929. From the 1880s through the 1920s, frontier days, stampedes, and cowboy contests were the most popular names. Cheyenne Frontier Days, which began in 1897, remains the most significant annual community celebration even today. Until 1922, cowboys and cowgirls who won at Cheyenne were considered the world's champions. Until 1912, organization of these community celebrations fell to local citizen committees who selected the events, made the rules, chose officials, arranged for the stock, and handled all other aspects of the festival. Many of these early contests bore more resemblance to Buffalo Bill's Wild West than to contemporary rodeo. While today's PRCA-sanctioned rodeos must include five events: calf roping, bareback and saddle bronc riding, bull riding, and steer wrestling, with the option to also hold steer roping and team roping, their Pre-World War I counterparts often offered only two of these contests. The day-long programs included diverse activities including Pony Express races, nightshirt races, and drunken rides. One even featured a football game. Almost all contests were billed as world's championships, causing confusion that endures to this day. Cowboys and cowgirls often did not know the exact events on offer until they arrived on site, and did not learn the rules of competition until they had paid their entry fees.LeCompte, \\"Wild West Frontier Days, Roundups and Stampedes: Rodeo Before there was Rodeo,\\" Canadian Journal of History of Sport, 12 (December 1985): 54-67; LeCompte, Cowgirls at the Crossroads: Women in Professional Rodeo, 1889-1922,\\" Canadian Journal of History of Sport, 14 (December 1989): 27-48 Before World War II, the most popular rodeo events included trick and fancy roping, trick and fancy riding, and racing. Trick and fancy roping contestants had to make figures and shapes with their lassos before releasing them to capture one or several persons or animals. These skills had to be exhibited on foot and on horseback. Fancy roping was the event most closely identified with the vaqueros, who invented it. In trick and fancy riding, athletes performed gymnastic feats on horseback while circling the arena at top speed. Athletes in these events were judged, much like those in contemporary gymnastics. The most popular races included Roman standing races wherein riders stood with one foot on the back of each of a pair of horses, and relays in which riders changed horses after each lap of the arena. Both were extremely dangerous, and sometimes fatal.LeCompte. Cowgirls the Rodeo: Pioneer Professional Athletes, Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2000, 48, 53, 59 Another great difference between these colorful contests and their modern counterparts was that there were no chutes or gates, and no time limits. Rough stock were blindfolded and snubbed in the center of the arenas where the riders mounted. The animals were then set free. In the vast arenas, which usually included a racetrack, rides often lasted more than 10 minutes, and sometimes the contestants vanished from view of the audience. During this era, women rode broncs and bulls and roped steers. They also competed in a variety of races, as well as trick and fancy roping and riding. In all of these contests, they often competed against men and won. Hispanics, blacks and Native Americans also participated in significant numbers. In some places, Native Americans were invited to set up camp on the grounds, perform dances and other activities for the audience, and participate in contests designated solely for them, Some rodeos did discriminate against one or more of these groups, but most were open to anyone who could pay the entry fee.LeCompte, \\"Cowgirls of the Rodeo\\", 40-61; LeCompte, \\"Wild West Frontier Days, Roundups and Stampedes, 54-67; LeCompte, Cowgirls at the Crossroads, 27-48. All this began to change in 1912, when a group of Calgary businessmen hired American roper Guy Weadick to manage, promote, and produce his first Stampede. Weadick selected the events, determined rules and eligibility, chose the officials, and invited well-known cowboys and cowgirls to take part. He hoped to pit the best Canadian hands against those of the US and Mexico, but Mexican participation was severely limited by the civil unrest in that country. Nonetheless, the Stampede was a huge success, and Weadick followed with the Winnipeg Stampede of 1913, and much less successful New York Stampede of 1916.LeCompte, \\"Wild West Frontier Days, Roundups and Stampedes, 54-67; LeCompte, \\"Cowgirls at the Crossroads,\\" 27-48. Although Weadick's last production, the 1919 Calgary Stampede, was only a minor success, he led the way for a new era in which powerful producers, not local committees, would dominate rodeo and greatly expand its audience. Rodeo enjoyed enormous popularity in New York, Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia, as well as in London, Europe, Cuba, South America, and the Far East in the 1920s and 1930s.Archives. National Cowgirl Hall of Fame, Ft. Worth, Texas; Archives, National Cowboy Hall of Fame, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Today, none of those venues is viable. Despite numerous tours abroad before World War II, rodeo is really significant only in North America. While it does exist in Australia and New Zealand, top athletes from those countries come to America to seek their fortunes. Some Latin American countries have contests called rodeos but these have none of the events found in the North American version. The rodeo was not originally a sporting event, but an integral part of cattle-ranching in areas of Spanish influence. The working rodeo was retained in parts of the US Southwest even after the US-Mexico War. In fact, it was important enough to merit legal status in California: \\"An Act to Regulate Rodeos (April 3, 1851)...Every owner of a stock farm shall be obliged to give, yearly, one general Rodeo, within the limits of his farm, from the first day of April until the thirty-first day of July, in the counties of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and San Diego; and in the remaining counties, from the first day of March until the thirty-first day of August...in order that parties interested may meet, for the purpose of separating their respective cattle.\\"[Compiled Laws of the State of California, 1850-53, p.337] One of these businesslike rodeos held in 1858, in old Los Angeles County is described by Harris Newmark: :The third week in February witnessed one of the most interesting gatherings of rancheros characteristic of Southern California life I have ever seen. It was a typical rodeo, lasting two or three days, for the separating and regrouping of cattle and horses, and took place at the residence of William Workman at La Puente rancho. Strictly speaking, the rodeo continued but two days, or less; for, inasmuch as the cattle to be sorted and branded had to be deprived for the time being of their customary nourishment, the work was necessarily one of dispatch. Under the direction of a Judge of the Plains--on this occasion, the polished cavalier, Don Felipe Lugo--they were examined, parted and branded, or re-branded, with hot irons impressing a mark (generally a letter or odd monogram) duly registered at the Court House and protected by the County Recorder's certificate. Never have I seen finer horsemanship than was there displayed by those whose task it was to pursue the animal and throw the lasso around the head or leg; and as often as most of those present had probably seen the feat performed, great was their enthusiasm when each vaquero brought down his victim. Among the guests were most of the rancheros of wealth and note, together with their attendants, all of whom made up a company ready to enjoy the unlimited hospitality for which the Workmans were so renowned. :Aside from the business in hand of disposing of such an enormous number of mixed-up cattle in so short a time, what made the occasion one of keen delight was the remarkable, almost astounding ability of the horseman in controlling his animal; for lassoing cattle was not his only forte. The vaquero of early days was a clever rider and handler of horses, particularly the bronco--so often erroneously spelled broncho--sometimes a mustang, sometimes an Indian pony. Out of a drove that had never been saddled, he would lasso one, attach a halter to his neck and blindfold him by means of a strap some two or three inches in width fastened to the halter; after which he would suddenly mount the bronco and remove the blind, when the horse, unaccustomed to discipline or restraint, would buck and kick for over a quarter of a mile, and then stop only because of exhaustion. With seldom a mishap, however, the vaquero almost invariably broke the mustang to the saddle within three or four days. This little Mexican horse, while perhaps not so graceful as his American brother, was noted for endurance; and he could lope from morning till night, if necessary, without evidence of serious fatigue. :Speaking of this dexterity, I may add that now and then the early Californian vaquero gave a good exhibition of his prowess in the town itself. Runaways, due in part to the absence of hitching posts but frequently to carelessness, occurred daily; and sometimes a clever horseman who happened to be near would pursue, overtake and lasso the frightened steed before serious harm had been done.Harris Newmark, Sixty years in Southern California, 1853-1913, containing the reminiscences of Harris Newmark. pp. 242-243. Rodeo after World War I World War I nearly killed rodeo, but three men and two organizations brought it back to greater prominence, not in the West where it was born, but in the big cities of the East. Tex Austin created the Madison Square Garden Rodeo in 1922. It immediately became the premier event. Overshadowing Cheyenne Frontier Days, its winners were thereafter recognized as the unofficial world champions. In 1924, Austin produced the London Rodeo at Wembley Stadium, universally acknowledged as the most successful international contest in rodeo history.LeCompte, \\"Cowgirls of the Rodeo\\", 18 However, despite his triumphs, Austin lost control of the Madison Square Garden contest, and his influence dwindled. A Texan, Col. William T. Johnson, took over the Garden rodeo. He soon began producing rodeos in other eastern indoor arenas, which forever changed the nature of the sport. There was no room indoors for races, and time constraints limited the number of events that could be included. Rodeos no longer lasted all day as they did under the western sky. Nonetheless, Johnson was a major figure in modernizing and professionalizing the sport. He also enabled big-time rodeo to thrive during the Great Depression. Prior to WWI, cowboys and cowgirls could not earn a living on rodeo winnings alone. Most were also Wild West show performers, and exhibition or \\"contract acts\\" at rodeos. The top names could appear in vaudeville in the off-season. Others found whatever jobs they could. But with the advent of the producers, and the expansion of the eastern circuit, rodeo gradually became a lucrative career for the best contestants, even as Wild West shows diminished and vanished. During the depths of the Depression, the rodeo publication \\"Hoofs and Horns,\\" estimated the average cowboy's earnings at $2,000-$3,000 annually. This placed them well above teachers, and near or above dentists in income. A few superstars earned far more.Fredriksson, American Rodeo, 37-39; LeCompte, \\"Cowgirls of the Rodeo\\", 9 By 1934, every rodeo that Johnson produced had set attendance records. A typical Johnson rodeo featured sixteen events, of which six were contests: cowboys bareback and saddle bronc riding, cowgirl bronc riding, cowboys steer riding, steer wrestling, and calf roping. Steer riding has now become bull riding, but other than that, Johnson's cowboy contests are the same as those mandated by the PRCA today. On the other hand, entertainment features such as basketball games on horseback and horseback quadrilles have largely disappeared.LeCompte, International Encyclopedia of Women and Sports. 941; \\"The Story of The Billboard, and Col. W. T. Johnson's Rodeos,\\" The Billboard, 29 October 1934, 75, LeCompte, Cowgirls of the Rodeo, 109. In 1929 two events occurred which split rodeo down the geographic middle: superstar cowgirl Bonnie McCarroll died as a result of a bronc riding accident at Pendleton, Oregon. Her death caused many western rodeos to drop women's contests. That same year, western rodeo producers formed the Rodeo Association of America (RAA) in an attempt to bring order to the chaotic sport. Largely as a result of McCarroll's death, the RAA was organized as an all-male entity. Despite pleas to do so, they refused to include any women's contests. The RAA hoped to standardize rules and events, and eliminate the unscrupulous promoters who threatened the integrity of the sport. The RAA also set out to determine the \\"true world's champion cowboys,\\" based on a system of points derived from money won in their sanctioned rodeos. This remains the basic system used today, but the dream of having only one \\"world's champion\\" would not be realized for decades. If not for the McCarroll tragedy, the rest of rodeo history might have been very different. It is unlikely there would ever have been a need for the WPRA, and barrel racing would probably not exist. Eastern producers did align themselves with Col. Johnson who ignored the RAA, and continued to include lucrative cowgirl contests at their rodeos. But that was short lived. The cowboys hated Col Johnson, whom they felt distributed prize money unfairly, and mostly to himself, while treating them with disdain. In 1936, they went on strike at his Boston Garden rodeo, demanding a bigger share of the gate as prize money. Garden management finally forced Johnson to relent, and the jubilant cowboys formed the Cowboys Turtle Association (CTA), which is now the powerful PRCA. A defeated Johnson sold his company and retired, never again to be seen or heard from in the rodeo business. Like the RAA, the CTA sanctioned no women's contests. The original board of the CTA included some of the top cowboys in the business: Hugh Bennett, Everett Bowman, Bob Crosby, Herman Linder, and Pete Knight. The CTA and RAA had a long and contentious relationship, but the cowboys ultimately prevailed.LeCompte, Cowgirls of the Rodeo, 114-115; Fredriksson, American Rodeo, 40-64. Interviews: Alice Greenough and Marjorie Greenough, Tucson, Arizona, 19 May 1988; Tad Lucas, Ft. Worth, Texas, 26 February 1988; and Isora De Racey Young, Stephenville, Texas, 27 February 1988. Cowboys' intense dislike of Johnson never abated, and was passed down to succeeding generations. Every rodeo producer mentioned in this article has been enshrined in one or more halls of fame excepting Johnson, who has never been nominated. At last check, neither rodeo hall of fame even included Johnson in their archives. Meantime, in 1931, promoters of the Stamford Cowboy Reunion invited all local ranches to send a young woman at least sixteen years old to compete in a Sponsor Contest designed \\"to add femininity to the all-male rodeo.\\" The women were judged on who had the best horse, the most attractive outfit, and on horsemanship as they rode a cloverleaf pattern around three barrels. The contest was a huge success, and was widely copied.LeCompte, \\"Home on the Range: Women in Professional Rodeo: 1929-1947,\\" Journal of Sport History 17 (Winter 1990): 335-337. In 1939, Johnson's replacement at Madison Square Garden, Everett Colburn, invited a group of Texas Sponsor Girls to appear at his rodeo as a publicity stunt. A second group appeared at the 1940 rodeo. It featured Hollywood singing Cowboy Gene Autry, and the women rode while he sang, \\"Home on the Range.\\" It was a tradition that continued for decades.LeCompte, \\"Home on the Range,\\" 335-344. Soon thereafter, Autry formed a rodeo company and took over not only Madison Square Garden, but also Boston Garden and most of the other major rodeos from coast-to-coast. One of his first actions was to discontinue the cowgirl bronc riding contest, which had been a highlight of the Madison Square Garden Rodeo since its inception in 1922. There was nothing left for cowgirls but the invitation-only sponsor girl event. Because of Gene Autry, real cowgirl contests disappeared from rodeos nationwide. Sponsor contests are the genesis of barrel racing, which is today the premier women's rodeo event. However, Autry's influence was far more vast and long-lasting. His popularity was such that producers nationwide found they could no longer attract a crowd without a western singer to headline their rodeos. Still today, rodeo is the only professional sport in which the athletes are not the featured performers. Autry is also credited with keeping the sport alive during World War II, thanks to his business acumen, and the heavily patriotic themes that permeated his productions.LeCompte, \\"Home on the Range,\\" 344. Rodeo after World War II Following the War, a merged CTA and RAA became the PRCA, and took complete control of the sport. Men like Austin, Johnson, and Autry could no longer wield the power they previously maintained. Consequently, the Madison Square Garden rodeo lost its luster, and the PRCA established the NFR, to determine for the next half century who were the true worlds champion cowboys. In forming their organization, cowboys were decades ahead of athletes in other professional sports. By 1953, the first year for which such information is available, the total prize money available at PRCA rodeos was $9,491,856. Thirty years later, the figure had risen to just over $13 million. As prize money rose, of course, so did individual earnings. In 1976, Tom Ferguson, competing in all four timed events, became the first cowboy to exceed $100,000 winnings in a single year. Only six years later, that figure was surpassed by a single-event contestant. Bareback bronc rider Bruce Ford, amassed $101,351 before the NFR. In 2006, all contestants coming into the NFR as leading money-winners in their events had earned at least $100,000, except team ropers, who had a little over $90,000 apiece. When the NFR began in 1959, the total purse was $50,000. Today, the figure is $5,375,000.Fredriksson, American Rodeo, 182-83; http://www.prorodeo.org/Records_NFR.aspx?su=7&xu;=7 (accessed May 3, 2007), LeCompte, \\"Hispanic Roots,\\" 66-67. However, the PRCA benefited primarily white males, as the diverse groups who had once competed in rodeo were largely absent from the arena. Native Americans now have their own rodeo organization, and have shown little interest in PRCA activities. Records give no indication of institutional racism on the part of the PRCA, although anecdotal evidence suggests that individual rodeo committees sometimes did discriminate against African Americans and Hispanics in the fifties and sixties. Nonetheless, black and Hispanic cowboys have won the PRCA worlds championships, with Leo Camarillo taking the team roping title five times, and earning fifteen consecutive trips to the NFR.Archives. Prorodeo Hall of Fame, LeCompte, Hispanic Roots, 67; LeCompte, Cowgirls of the Rodeo, 148-171. Women realized it would be up to them to get back into the mainstream of the sport. Following a successful all-girl rodeo, many of the participants met in 1948 to form what is now the WPRA. The organization aimed to provide women the opportunity to compete in legitimate, sanctioned contests at PRCA rodeos and in rough stock and roping events at all-girl rodeos. While prize money from all-girl rodeos never provided participants with enough money to meet expenses, the WPRA was highly successful in restoring cowgirl contests to PRCA rodeos. Barrel racing was the most popular WPRA contest and it spread rapidly throughout the country. In 1955, PRCA president Bill Linderman and WPRA president Jackie Worthington signed an historic agreement that remained in effect for half a century. It urged the inclusion of WPRA barrel racing at PRCA rodeos, and required that women's events at PRCA rodeos conform to WPRA rules and regulations. Following a lengthy campaign, barrel racing was added to the NFR in 1968.Interviews with Nancy Binford, Dixie Reger Mosley, and Mary Ellen Barton, Hereford, Texas, 15 March 1988; Binford's scrapbooks and files located in Archives, National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, Fort Worth, Texas; \\"All Girl Rodeo a Knockout,\\" clipping, n.p. n.d., Binford scrapbook; \\"Rodeo Spectators Stetsons Off to Feminine Bulldogger,\\" Amarillo Daily News, 24 September 1947, 1;.

(Unfortunately, it is not possible to chronicle this achievement from the women's point of view. Although it is known that many WPRA representatives spent countless hours and traveled thousands of miles pleading their case to the PRCA before finally succeeding with the help of the Oklahoma City promoters, their names will never be known. Alone among all of the organizations and agencies involved with this project, the WPRA refused to allow this writer access to any of its files, documents or minutes); PRCA Official Media Guide (1987), 195-217. Although the barrel race was in the NFR, cowgirls‚Äô prize money was far below that of cowboys. The gender equity movement led the WPRA in 1980 to send an ultimatum to 650 rodeo committees nationwide that if prizes were not equal by 1985, the WPRA would not participate. There was almost universal compliance, except for the NFR. The WPRA obtained corporate sponsors to increase their NFR purse to that of the team ropers, the lowest paid cowboy participants, whose already small purse had to be split between the two team members. At the 1997 NFR, cowboys and cowgirls led by team roper Matt Tyler threatened to strike unless they received equal prize money. This cooperative effort resulted in successful negotiations. Since 1998, the NFR has paid equal money to all participants. The additional funding comes from the sale of special luxury seats.LeCompte, \\"Rodeo,\\" in\\" International Encyclopedia of Women and Sports,\\" 942.

In 1923, Tex Austin hired the New Yankee Stadium for 10 days and intended to offer $50,000 in prize money, double of what was offered at the previous Madison Square Garden rodeo the year prior. Tickets for the event were between $2‚Äì3. Tex Austin planned to pay the cowboys 100 cents on the dollar. Events offered were \\"bronk\\" riding, bulldogging, calf roping, trick and fancy riding, \\"steer\\" riding, relay race and the cowgirl's bronk riding. Famous bad horses: Mystery, Nose Dive, P.J. Nutt and Peaceful Henry were at the contest in the prior year. Riders included Mike Hastings, Mabel Strickland, Roy Quick, Ike Rude, Powder River Thompson, Bonnie McCarroll and Bonnie Gray, as well as many others. Formation of rodeo associations In 1929 the Rodeo Association of America (RAA) was formed bringing promoters and managers together.Groves, Melody, (2006). - Ropes, Reins, and Rawhide: All About Rodeo . - Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press. - p.4-5. - It compiled scores from rodeo events at the 50 some rodeos across North America including Cheyenne, Wyoming; Pendleton, Oregon; Calgary, Alberta; and Salinas, California. The RAA sanctioned events, selected judges, and established purse awards and point systems. Their judges documented and determined champions in each event. The new organization was far from perfect. Often, prize money was not as advertised and judging was sometimes unfair. The RAA inaugurated the first national champions in 1929. However, they didn't include any women's events. Bonnie McCarroll (1897‚Äì1929) was killed after being thrown from a bronc at the Pendleton Round-Up. This tragedy initiated a national outcry against women competing in rodeo events. In 1930, rain spoiled a rodeo at Miller's 101 Ranch in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Turtles came out and someone had an idea to race the turtles instead of horses. With a whopping 10,000 entries, most watched as most of the turtles laid still while just a few plodded along. First place went to the owner of turtle Goober Dust taking home $7,100. Second place took home $1,250. These turtles, however, were not attributed to the Cowboy Turtles Association (CTA) which was started several years later in 1936. In 1934, the World Series Rodeo arrived in Madison Square Garden. The rodeo offered $40,000 in prizes. The World Series Rodeo promoter, Colonel William T. Johnson, had lost $40,000 promoting a Wild West Show in Texas six years prior and decided to promote his money back. He put on 5 rodeos a year and expected to make $1,000,000, with his contract in New York expected to make $75,000. He estimated losing $6,000 a year to bad loans to cowboys. Johnson was not a member of the Rodeo Association of America but his events offered more prize money and cowboys seemed to find his events the most enjoyable. But by 1939, William Johnson had sold all of his rodeo stock and was not in attendance at the World Series Rodeo. Instead, he went back to ranching after completely selling out of his highly speculative business. In 1935, Earl W. Bascom, along with his brother Weldon, Mel and Jake Lybbert and Waldo \\"Salty\\" Ross produced the first rodeos in southern Mississippi, working from Columbia, in the process holding one of the world's first night rodeos held outdoors under electric lights and bringing in brahma bulls for the bull riding event. These rodeos also featured trick roping, stunt riding and other novelty acts. Mississippian Sam Hickman financed their operations, which were successful from 1935 to 1937.http://www.bascombronze.com/biography/index2.shtml (The first night rodeo was held in Preston, Idaho, in 1934.)http://www.prestonrodeo.com/information.htm In 1936, during the Boston Garden Rodeo, William Johnson refused to add entry fees into the prize money. A group of angry cowboys formed the Cowboy Turtles Association. It was the first association of contestants. They called themselves turtles because they were slow to organize but eventually stuck their heads out. That same year, Tex Austin, Wild West Promoter, was charged with \\"permitting an animal to be terrified\\" when a steer accidentally crashed into the exit gate of the arena. In 1937, Pete Knight died after suffering from internal injuries after being thrown from the horse \\"Duster\\" at a rodeo in Hayward, California. At the time of this death, he had more champion titles and prize money than any other bronc rider in the world. Walter Cravens, steer rider, was thrown and trampled and died one day later of a punctured lung at the World Series Rodeo in New York City. By 1939, rodeos attracted twice as many spectators as auto racing and baseball. In 1940, the Cowboys Amateur Association (CAA) formed in California. Its purpose was to allow amateurs to compete and gain more experience before moving up to the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA). Members were required to move up to the RCA once their earnings reached $500. The CAA also encouraged participation from women in barrel racing and cutting contests. In 1945, the Cowboy Turtles Association changed their name to the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA) which later in 1975 changed to the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). In 1947, movie star Gene Autry signed a contract to star in the Madison Square Garden Rodeo. He got a salary of $1,500 a day for a 33-day run as a performer. In 1948, the Girl's Rodeo Association was started by a group of Texas ranch women. Today, the organization has two sister associations - The Professional Women's Rodeo Association (PWRA) and the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA). In 1949 the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association was formed and grew extremely quickly. The first College National Finals Rodeo (CNFR) was held the same year in San Francisco, California. By 1951, the association had 41 participating colleges. By 1955, it was estimated that there were over 600 rodeos in the country. The Miss Rodeo America pageant was organized with the first pageant held by International Rodeo Management in Casper, Wyoming. The first National Finals Rodeo was held in Dallas, Texas in 1959. The top 15 money-earners from the RCA in each event were invited to compete and winnings from the NFR were added to their winnings from the rodeo circuit to determine a world champion. In 1960, the NFR was shown on TV broadcast by CBS. In 1961, rodeo interest further branched out to include high school students with the formation of the National High School Rodeo Association. The NFR moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1962 and then settled in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for a 20-year stay from 1965‚Äì1984. Since 1985, the event has taken place at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1975, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame opened in Hereford. It was subsequently located to a modern, much larger facility in Fort Worth. Many of its inductees have been rodeo competitors. In 1979 the PRCA established the ProRodeo Hall of Fame located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is the only museum in the world devoted to the sport of professional rodeo and the PRCA rodeo cowboy. The statue in the front of the hall depicts Casey Tibbs riding the bronc Necktie. In 1987, the National Circuit Finals Rodeo began in Pocatello, Idaho. The top 2 contestants in each event from the 12 different PRCA regional circuits compete for the title of national circuit finals champion for each event. Dodge became a title sponsor for the event in 1991. In 1989, the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame opened in the Fort Worth Stockyards in Fort Worth. Many of its inductees have been active in rodeo. With all of the attention rodeo began to get from the media, animal rights concerns escalated. Friends of Rodeo were formed in 1992 as an organization to protect rodeo. That same year, a group of 20 professional bull riders, each of which contributed $1,000 formed the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The organization aims to take one of the most famous events in rodeo into a stand- alone sport. They have flourished and today the Built Ford Tough Series is a 29 city, $10 million tour that attracts more than 100 million viewers on televised events. In 2015, the Bull Riding Hall of Fame, located in Fort Worth, Texas, was established. This hall of fame inducts bull riders and bulls from both the PRCA and the PBR. It also gathers and preserves memorabilia and artifacts from bull riding. The term 'rodeo' (from the Spanish, rodear) means \\"to surround\\" or \\"go around\\" in Spanish, and was first used in American English about 1834 to denote a \\"round up\\" of cattle.Dictionary Early rodeo- like affairs of the 1820s and 1830s were informal events in the western United States and northern Mexico with cowboys and vaqueros testing their work skills against one another.Allen: 17Groves: Additional material Santa Fe, New Mexico lays claim to the first rodeo based on a letter dated 1847 written by Captain Mayne Reid from Santa Fe to a friend in Ireland: > \\"At this time of year, the cowmen have what is called the round-up, when the > calves are branded and the fat beasts selected to be driven to a fair > hundreds of miles away. This round-up is a great time for the cowhand, a > Donny-brook fair it is indeed. They contest with each other for the best > roping and throwing, and there are horse races and whiskey and wines. At > night in clear moonlight, there is dancing on the streets.\\"Johnson: 102 Following the American Civil War, organized rodeo emerged with the first held in Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1872. Prescott, Arizona claims the distinction of holding the first professional rodeo when it charged admission and awarded trophies in 1888.Allen: 18 Between 1890 and 1910, rodeo became a public entertainment made popular through Wild West Shows and Fourth of July celebrations with Buffalo Bill Cody, Annie Oakley, and other charismatic stars lending their glamour and prestige to the spectacle.Groves: Oakley was a sharpshooter in Cody's Wild West show (rather than as a rodeo performer), but she created the image of the cowgirl and appeared as the first cowgirl in a western film shot by Thomas Alva Edison in 1894.Fussell: 70-71 In the early decades of the twentieth century, rodeo became a spectator sport with round ups, frontier days, and other themed exhibitions attracting regional audiences. In the 1920s, Madison Square Garden and Boston Garden drew nationwide attention staging rodeos. Every rodeo was independent and selected its own events from among nearly one hundred different contests. Until World War I, there was little difference between rodeo and charreada, and competitors from the United States, Mexico and Canada participated freely in all three countries. In 1929, local rodeo boards, stock contractors, and sponsors formed the Rodeo Association of America (later the International Rodeo Association) to police rodeo by forbidding false advertising of big money purses, and self-styled \\"championship\\" rodeos. By the mid-1930s, cowboys had organized themselves into the Cowboys Turtle Association which eventually became the Rodeo Cowboys Association, and finally the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association in 1975. Gas rationing and other restrictions attending World War II hit rodeo hard with women's ranch events such as bronc riding curtailed and inexpensive barrel racing and beauty pageants being held in their stead. Following the war, rodeo gender bias faced women and in response they formed the Girls Rodeo Association in 1948 (now the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA)). Women then held their own rodeos.Allen: 24-25 In 1958, the RCA created the National Finals Rodeo Commission to produce a major, end-of-season rodeo event similar in prestige to baseball's World Series and hockey's Stanley Cup. CBS telecast the first such event. Though rodeo had traditionally suspected television to be a liability rather than an asset (keeping people home to watch rodeo rather than attending competitions), the industry heartily approved the telecast. Rodeo schools, which had their tentative beginnings in the 1930s, gained attention and growth through the 1950s, with the first regular school opening in 1962.Westermeier: 435ff In the 1970s, rodeo saw unprecedented growth. Contestants referred to as \\"the new breed\\" brought rodeo increasing media attention. These contestants were young, typically from an urban background, and chose rodeo for its athletic rewards. Photojournalists and reporters viewed them as a source of interesting stories about behind-the-scenes routines and lifestyles. The \\"new breed\\" was a far cry from traditional rodeo men who sought all-night binges rather than the stock portfolios, airline credit cards, recording and television contracts, and retirement packages desired by the new breed. By 1985, one third of PRCA members admitted to a college education and one half admitted to never having worked on a cattle ranch.Allen: 32 Claimants for the oldest or longest running rodeo *Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo, longest running in the United States (livestock show began 1896, rodeo added 1917)Texas State Historical Association, , Handbook of Texas *Cowtown Rodeo, longest running weekly rodeo in the United States, started in 1929 *Prescott, Arizona, in 1888 was the first to charge an admission. *Payson, Arizona, oldest annual continuous running rodeo. *Pecos, Texas, first rodeo on July 4, 1883, and in 1929 began running annually without interruption. *Deer Trail, Colorado on July 4, 1869. *Raymond Stampede, Canada's first professional rodeo and longest running, started in 1902 See also *National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum Notes References          * * Rodeo ","title":"History of rodeo"},{"id":"10524299","text":"Lows Lake is a lake in the Adirondack Park in northeastern New York. It is in the New York State Forest Preserve Five Ponds Wilderness Area, southwest of Tupper Lake. The Adirondack Park Agency classifies the lake as a Primitive Area meaning that it is wilderness in character, but contains artificial structures and private lands. It is also named Bog River Flow, since it was artificially created by damming the river of that name. The area is home to Sabattis Scout Reservation, a multi-thousand acre summer camp for Boy Scouts. History The lake was created by the eponymous Abbot Augustus Low, who dammed the Bog River to create a hydroelectric reservoir. The first, now known as Lows Lower dam, was built in 1903, to provide electricity for the Horseshoe Forestry Company. A second, now Lows Upper dam, was added in 1907 and created Lows Lake from Mud Lake, Bog River Flow, Tomar Pond, and Grass Pond. These were part of Low's commercial enterprise which included railways connecting the area with New York City, and the production of maple syrup and lumber. On the granite ledge above the second dam, there is a plaque commemorating Low's memory. His ashes were spread from the ledge. Recreation The lake has about 35 primitive campsites. Access is via a short gravel road off New York State Route 421 to Lows Lower Dam where small craft can be hand launched. Fishing is predominantly for the introduced and plentiful largemouth bass. There is also some brown bullhead and brook trout. The length of the large shallow lake aligns with the prevailing winds, and wind can create a small craft hazard due to rough water. At the western end of the lake is a three and a half mile portage to the Oswegatchie River which passes by Big Deer Pond and a long esker before reaching the upper source of the Oswegatchie.  Scouting  On the Eastern end of the lake along the northern shore is Sabattis Scout Reservation, an extensive, wilderness-based summer camp owned by the Longhouse Council, Boy Scouts of America. Sabattis is also home to the James \\" Marmaduke\\" Seton Trek Center, a launching point for backcountry treks throughout the Adirondack Mountains. Conservation The lake is one of New York's largest loon nesting areas. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation prohibits mechanically propelled boats between the upper and lower dams. Although the Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan states that the lake is \\"part of the Lows Lake-Bog River-Oswegatchie wilderness canoe route\\", banned floatplanes,Adirondack Almanac, \\"APA OKs Ban On Lows Lake floatplanes After 2011\\", April 16, 2009 and motorboat usage by the public, motors continue to be used by owners of the private in-holdings. The northeast shore is private, along with a few small parcels bordering the lake. Geography Grass Pond Mountain, , is north of the lake and has expansive views from its summit. Graves Mountain, , is named after a 19th- century hunter from Tupper Lake; its southern flank was eroded after the forest fire of 1906, exposing a large granite face; a survey marker is located at its peak. The lake contains two large floating bogs.

History =Formation= The band, originally from the city of Santa Fe, was formed in 1994. At first, their music was punk, with songs such as \\"Uniformado de Cag√≥n\\", but they left that genre behind to start making so-called \\"hardcore- dark\\" music. In 1997 they released Hijos de una nueva tierra, which was published by the independent record label Mentes Abiertas, which they first met in a compilation album along with other alternative rock bands. =Alas and Eclipse (Sol)= In 1998 the band decided to move to Buenos Aires. Their new record, Alas, produced by ex-Soda Stereo member Zeta Bosio, was edited by Sony Music later that year. This meant a change in the sound direction to a heavier and darker music. In 2002, Alas was edited in Mexico, followed by a ten-month tour throughout the country. Back in Argentina, Cabezones signed a recording contract with Pop Art to edit Eclipse (Sol) in 2003. By the end of that year, Leandro Aput was added as rhythm guitarist. =Intraural and Jardin de Extremidad= In 2004, the band released an EP called Intraural, which was a selection of 6 songs from Eclipse (Sol) played in acoustic versions. In April 2005 Jardin de Extremidad is released with 12 new songs combining the sound of the two previous records Alas and Eclipse (Sol). Billed as \\"Gira de Extremidad\\", the \\"Jardin de Extremidad\\" tour traveled throughout Argentina. On February 18, 2006 the band recorded its first live CD/DVD titled Bienvenidos, with sold-out tickets at a theater in Buenos Aires. =Accident and disbanding= In March, 2006, a serious car accident left Catupecu Machu bass player, Gabriel Ruiz Diaz, hospitalized for several months. Cesar Andino was the passenger of the car and suffered two broken femurs, one of them an open fracture. After several months of rehabilitation, Cesar Andino was able to perform with Cabezones in the Obras Sanitarias stadium, once again with sold-out tickets. Finally, near Christmas, Cabezones gave which would be the last show with the original members. In July 2007, Leandro Aput, Esteban Serniotti y Gustavo Martinez left the band. Frontman Cesar Andino, started seeking a solo career, which later ended in the release of the latest Cabezones album. =New members and Solo= On September 29, 2007, Cabezones played in the Pepsi Music Festival with new members Leonardo Licitra and Pablo Negro in guitars, and Matias Tarragona in bass guitar. In May 2008 they launched their record, Solo. The first single is called ‚ÄúMi Reina‚Äù. The videoclip for this song included various members from other Argentine bands.

Isaac Asimov wrote an introduction for the book and published it under his \\"Isaac Asimov Presents\\" series. Pennterra was reprinted in 2009 by Fantastic Books, an imprint of Warren Lapine's Wilder Publications. Plot Quaker colonists founded a colony on a planet they dubbed Pennterra. They soon discovered the planet was already inhabited, by a species they dub the \\"hrossa\\". They put forward a number of conditions to the colonists, saying that they must not leave the valley they landed in, must not use machinery, and should keep their population about the same as the time they landed, approximately 600. The Quakers agree with these restrictions, and set up a camp called Swarthmore, in the valley they call the Delaware. The hrossa, being capable of transferring their emotions onto others, often tapped into the Quakers as they held meeting for worship. This leaves a number of them much more tolerant of the hrossa conditions. Several, including George Quinlan and his son Danny, become more closely acquainted with the hrossa. At times they visit a nearby village called Lake-Between-Falls and develop a friendship with one of its elders, KliUrrh. However, as the story begins a second colony ship arrives from Earth. These colonists, called the Sixers, are more skeptical of the hrossa request, and enter talks with the Quakers. For the most part, the Sixers are adamant about colonizing the planet with machinery, putting their own survival above the hrossa. However, two members of the crew, Maggie and Byron, along with Quakers Katy and George visit Lake-Between-Falls hoping for permission for a coastal town of their own. However, KliUrrh denies the request, saying that they must follow the same conditions given to the Quaker colonists. He explains that their god TuwukhKawan will never allow this, and they would be destroyed if they violate the request. Many of the Quakers take this as representing a legitimate threat, but the Sixers do not see it as serious and believe the Quakers have simply been compromised by their contact with the hrossa. With permission from the hrossa, a team of Quakers come to Lake-Between-Falls to learn more about the hrossa and the planet in general, in order to get an idea of the threat to the Sixers. The team consists of George, Swarthmore's de facto leader; his son, Danny, who is capable with the hross language; Katy, a psychologist; Alice, an exobiologist; and Bob, an amateur anthropologist. Initially, they make little progress, as the sexuality of the hross is transmitted to the team, making it difficult to do any work. This is especially problematic for Danny, who at age 12 has begun puberty. In separate encounters, Alice has sex with George, and Katy with Bob. It soon becomes apparent that free-for-all sex might be necessary to keep them at work, but George initially resists due to his son's presence. Another day, Katy allows Danny to dry hump her, to George's unease. However, he gives in and soon the five have regular intercourse with one another, including, after some time, Danny with his father. This makes it easier for the team to work. Among their discoveries, they find out that the hermaphroditic hrossa typically give birth to only one child in a lifetime, and few die early. The occasional second birth makes up for those that do, and the population thus tends to remain stable. Going on a hunt with the hrossa, they learn that they hunt by transmitting a message of \\"hunger\\", which brings animals sacrificially to them. The hrossa have sexual intercourse with the animals, and then beat them with a club. The Quakers also tell many stories to the hrossa, hoping to trigger a response and learn more about the planet's natives. Finally, at Thanksgiving, the team leaves back to Swarthmore, and explain their findings to the town. The team goes back for another month, but have little more success. Returning to camp, Danny has difficulty readjusting. Missing the hrossa form of sexuality, he finds himself having sex with sheep, and on a couple of occasions, the sympathetic Katy. Danny, being the only person his age in the town besides a kid named Jack, finds life back home insufferable. When Jack is offered to stay for some time in the new Sixer village, Danny is adamant about going there as well. There Danny stays with Maggie, and goes to school in a town that allows him many more peers. He has trouble adjusting at first. He finds himself enjoying the skills behind basketball, but put off by the competition. Initially, his best friend in the colony is Maggie, who finds he acts much more mature than his age. Eventually, however, he meets a kid named Joel, who is highly interested in the hross. The two grow close, to the point he is comfortable discussing his sexual quirks. Joel describes him as a \\"human hross\\", which puts off Danny at first. However, he soon realizes the term fits his sexuality, but relabels himself a \\"Quaker hross\\". One morning Danny leaves for a walk and notices footprints. Following them, he eventually comes to find Caddie, a classmate of his, alone and naked. She seems scared, which Danny does not understand, and when he turns to let her change, she knocks him out with a rock. Danny later learns that her father was abusing her, and reports him to a psychiatrist. Soon afterwards, she is adopted by another family in the settlement, and appears to show improvement. Meanwhile, problems start to impact Sixertown. Many of the pregnant women who arrived on the planet had miscarriages or sudden abortions. A hross came to visit Danny, and told him he must leave the town soon, as the \\"destruction\\" was coming soon to Sixertown. The captain of the town allowed anyone who felt that the threat was credible to relocate to Swarthmore. However, only Danny, Joel, Jack, Caddie and Byron took the threat seriously, and were joined by Maggie in the trip to the Quaker town. However, the lander crashed and the five became stranded. They soon found water near the crash site, but their food reserves were limited, and it soon became clear that hoping for help to come to the lander might not be their best option. Maggie stayed with the lander to take care of Joel, as the others head out hoping to make it back on foot, or be found otherwise by someone. After some point, food reserves became scarce, and Caddie grew weak. Danny found that some animals would approach him, which he could have sex with and kill as the hrossa did. Byron decided that he should remain to take care of Caddie, and that Jack and Danny should continue on as before. Exhausted, they became famished at times only to have more animals offering themselves for sacrifice. After some time, they found their way back to the Delaware River, some 50 miles from camp, and were discovered. While Caddie died, the other five survived back to camp. In the meantime, the problem at the Sixer camp became more serious, with none of their food sources able to reproduce. Eventually they gave in to the original hross conditions, and moved into the southern portion of the Delaware River. However, the population there was left permanently infertile due to their exposure to the compound that caused all their problems. It is also realized that those going through physical development on the planet could more easily integrate the planet's ecosystem than those who did not. This leaves the future situation of the human settlement unclear, as it suggests that those born on Pennterra could survive outside a human colony. Reception Writing in The New York Times, Noel Perrin described the Moffett's book as \\"the only work of Quaker science fiction I know,\\" saying it \\"already establishes her as a presence in the field. It's as interesting ecologically as literarily.\\"\\"Science Fiction: Imaginary Worlds and Real-Life Questions\\", The New York Times, April 9, 1989 Orson Scott Card praised Pennterra as \\"storytelling of the best sort,\\" declaring that Moffett \\"handles all the genre techniques with skill, and with great respect for her material and her audience; she deals with ideas with intelligence and passion. . . .

History =Empire of Japan= The Grass Mountain Chateau, a building surrounded by a partially landscaped site, was built by Taiwan Sugar Corporation in 1920. The chateau served as a recreational facility for employees and hosted Japanese royalty. Emperor Hirohito of Japan personally visited the residence and stayed there for 1 hour and 50 minutes, according to historical records. =Republic of China / Taiwan= When in 1949 the Republic of China government fled from Nanking to Taipei in Taiwan, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek claimed the chateau as his first official residence. The site served as Chiang's main residence for a year until a mansion closer to central Taipei could be completed. After the shift of Taiwan society to modern democracy in the 1990s, the chateau and its grounds served as both a historical museum and an art exhibition center, both of which are open to the public. On April 7, 2001 at around 12:22 AM a large fire engulfed the main halls of the chateau. The Yangmingshan Fire Department had to call in other engines nearby Shilin and Shipai. The fire was put under control at around 1:20 AM but caused widespread damage. Taipei City officials reported the cause as arson, but stopped short of speculating that the motive may have been political. Three days later the Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs announced that the site would be restored at a cost of $US900,000. On December 29, 2011, the chateau reopened.

Club career Callej√≥n was born in Motril, Province of Granada. In 2005‚Äì06, he played in 33 games and scored eight goals for Real Madrid's Juvenil A and, in March 2007, he made his senior debut for the B-side, finishing the season in the second division with that sole substitute appearance as they dropped down a level. In 2007‚Äì08, Callej√≥n played together with brother Jos√© as Real B were now in division three. On 11 August 2008 he signed a four-year contract with RCD Mallorca, leaving in the same transfer window as his twin brother ‚Äì the Balearic Islands club retained 75% of the player's rights.

On 25 August 2009, Callej√≥n was loaned to Albacete Balompi√© of the second division in a season-long move. He stayed in that tier for 2010‚Äì11, joining C√≥rdoba CF in his native Andalusia on a free transfer.

The Trust was formed in 2002 by a merger of Gloucestershire Royal and East Gloucestershire NHS Trusts, has an annual operating income of ¬£550m, 960 beds, over 150,000 emergency attendances and 800,000 outpatient appointments each year. The Trust employs around 8,000 people, providing care for the population of Gloucestershire and beyond. In 2017 the trust investigated the establishing of a subsidiary company (SubCo). On 28 February 2018 the trust board approved the recommendations which resulted in the creation of Gloucestershire Hospitals Subsidiary Company Ltd (trading as Gloucestershire Managed Services), to which 675 support staff were transferred on 1 April 2018. The intention was to achieve VAT benefits, as well as pay bill savings, by recruiting new staff on less expensive non-NHS contracts. VAT benefits arise because NHS trusts can only claim VAT back on a small subset of goods and services they buy. The Value Added Tax Act 1994 provides a mechanism through which NHS trusts can qualify for refunds on contracted out services.

It was founded in 1850 by Christian Barchman under the name Ericsbergs metall och tackjerns-gjuteri. It delivered its last ship in 1979.  History  =Introduction= Founded in 1850 by Christian Barchman, the company originally worked with galvanization. The first shipyard wharf was opened in 1871, and two years later they delivered their first ship. In 1876 the company was transformed into a joint-stock company, and so the name was changed to Eriksbergs Mekaniska Werkstads AB. In the beginning of the 1890s, the shipyard was still the smallest of the three wharfs that existed in Gothenburg. Production was based on passenger ships, steam cutters and towboats for Denmark, Norway and Finland, and ferries for Stockholm's public transportation. In 1915 Eriksberg underwent massive developments to accommodate production of larger ships after a major takeover of the corporation's stocks by Dan Brostr√∂m. =Eriksberg's developments up to the 1960s= Eriksberg underwent similar developments as the other Swedish major shipbuilding companies; Kockums Mekaniska Verkstads AB, AB G√∂taverken and AB Lindholmens Varv - partly through World War I and the post-war period until 1940; a successive expansion triggered by a shipping boom and in particular by Norwegian and Swedish shipowner's need of new and bigger ships. In this regard, Eriksberg had an advantage through the direct- ownership by the Brostr√∂m family (later through their listed mother company √Öngfartygsaktiebolaget Tirfing). With a relatively modest share capital (6.5 million SEK) Eriksberg was able to make net profits of 40-50 million SEK every year during the 1940s. The cause for this was an unprecedented profitability during the second world war, repairing war-damaged tonnage and strong demand for replacement tonnage for Swedish and Norwegian shipping companies. This was enhanced by the favourable \\"wartime windfall taxes\\" introduced during the war. Most of these extraordinary profits were reinvested within shipping and industrial investments of the Brostr√∂m Group, and this contributed to Brostr√∂m's becoming the country's richest group in the beginning of the 1960s. In the beginning of the 1950s, Eriksberg obtained the rights to manufacture Burmeister & Wains diesel motors, unlike G√∂taverken who chose to manufacture their own original designs. This involved a certain lead for the production of large tankers, and the size records of ships were being constantly broken. Many thought that the weight limit, 40,000 tonnes deadweight, was reached. Eriksberg's financial position was solid, like the other competitors in Sweden. Both Kockums and G√∂taverken were listed and were independent companies, while Eriksberg and Lindholmen were owned by shipping companies. During the 1950s and the 1960s, Eriksberg was the most profitable shipyard in the country, and to work at 'Torpet' (the name used by the public) was a 'status job' in Gothenburg. = The financial crisis = The last profitable decade was the 1960s, before competition from the Japanese shipbuilding industry became too fierce. When Norwegian shipping companies discontinued refinancing their vessel purchases in the United States capital market (the Interest Equalization Tax), requirements were put on Swedish wharfs to hand out credits with subsidized interests and conditions, like the Japanese industry. Eriksberg succeeded however, unlike its competitors G√∂taverken and Kockums, to retain high solvency and go through the last years of the 1960s relatively unhurt. Both Kockums and G√∂taverken, being public companies, were insolvent and were saved, through a combination of private and state intervention. In the case of G√∂taverken, the Sal√©n Group of Stockholm, assumed ownership for a limited time with the option to regaining its investment from the State. In the beginning of the 1970s, it became clear to the company's management that there was only a respite of a few years before the economic resources were exhausted. The rise of wages and salaries, enforced by the trade unions in the beginning of the 1970s, increased the company's cost by around 25% in the span of only a few years. The Swedish krona with recurring devaluations raised import prices for the wharf. When the Bretton Woods system was abandoned in 1973 and the US dollar became \\"floating\\", it was obvious that the Swedish shipbuilding industry was at the brink of ruin. For Eriksberg, the 1970s started nevertheless in positive territory. They acquired Lindholmens Mekaniska Verkstad and built the Portuguese wharfs Lisnave and later Setenave, that among other things, delivered the bows for the company's supertankers (VLCC, ULCC). In 1973 Eriksberg sold their repair business to G√∂taverken to become pure new building shipyard. In 1974 the company's management issued an anticipated warning about the serious state of the company, and the Managing Director Bengt Eneroth resigned after being with the company for 33 years. He had consciously held back new investments in buildings and equipment but the company was still hit. The unfavorable refinancing in foreign currencies created huge losses, as for the other wharfs, by the major problem were the customers, the shipping companies, canceling contracts and amortizations. The situation, however, was not handled well by the new company management from AB Tirfing, the owners, and they were eventually forced to sell Eriksberg for a symbolic 1000 krona and sign two very expensive ship building contracts with the new owners, now the soon defunct G√∂taverken Group. In the long run, this meant a coup de grace for Brostr√∂mkoncernen and Tirfing, which were listed on the Stockholm stock exchange. This also meant the end of the once fortunate and rich Brostr√∂m Group The obstinate attitude of the trade-unions and the socialist government to not lose a single job of the shipbuilders, proved to be a ticking bomb that in the end led to the death of the shipbuilding industry in Sweden. But this would take another 10 years. The government's irresponsible economic policies, driven by the Social Democratic governments, in tandem with the metalworkers union, alongside the devaluations of the Swedish Krona that made imports expensive, unreasonable wage increases eaten up by progressive taxes and an inconsistent currency regulation, which made it impossible to match the Krona with the credit commitments in US dollar, brought the shipbuilding industry to an end. The total cost for the State of shutting down this industry has been estimated to 39 billion Kronor ( 1986). thumbright250pxEriksberg's 84 m high, orange gantry crane built in Cologne 1969 =Eriksberg is taken over and is closed down= At this point, Eriksberg Mekaniska Verkstad had 6000 employees. Despite the example of Eriksberg, it was not taken seriously and so investments at G√∂taverken and Uddevallavarvet was not questioned. Billions were lost because of over optimistic wharf directors. Eriksberg became a sister company of G√∂taverken, before both became part of Svenska Varv, which was run by the government, in 1978. During 1978-79 all activities were successfully terminated at Eriksberg, and on 15 June 1979 the shipyards last vessel, a product tanker M/T Atland was delivered to Brostr√∂ms, that was already on the brink of bankruptcy. Just about a year before the shut down Erikbergs Mekaniska Verkstad had delivered the ULCC:s 'Nai Superba' and 'Nai Genova' at about 460 000 dwt each! The greatest ships ever built in Gothenburg as well as they were among the last. The Nai-ships were demolished in year 2000-2001. Today, all that remains of EMV is an 84m high, orange gantry crane and two workshop halls; the engine workshop 'Bl√• Hallen', today hosting a hotel and conference facility, and the former workshop 'Eriksbergshallen' with the text 'Eriksbergs Mek.

Its serialization began in the monthly Comic BIRZ in 2003. The manga is popular for its over-the-top gore and violence, and for the young main character and the different sex acts she partakes in. Plot overview Tokyo Red Hood is about an eleven-year-old girl who usually just goes by the name of Akazukin (Little Red Riding Hood). She has a sick obsession with a being known only as Mr. Wolf and wants nothing more than to be eaten by him to end her \\"immortal\\" life. Akazukin has lost all of her memories and doesn't even know who she really is. Her reason to want to be eaten by Mr. Wolf is not even known to her, instead it's a desire that is locked deep within her consciousness. The beings of the world are mainly made up of two forces. The people who aid Akazukin in her search for Mr. Wolf, and the people who try to keep Akazukin away from Mr. Wolf. The people of the church and disciples of God try to keep Akazukin from completing her mission to meet Mr. Wolf. Their reason for doing this is because if Akazukin is eaten by the Wolf, it would bring along an end to the world and humankind as it exists in the present day. The people whose origins are from the underworld aid Akazukin to find Mr. Wolf so the fate of the world being destroyed can be fulfilled. They mainly do this discreetly and behind the shadows. Akazukin works as an organ harvester for an Italian butcher named Marco. From there she hunts new bodies for him and all the while trying to find Mr. Wolf. Along the way she meets villains who stand in her way from fulfilling her wish to be eaten by Mr. Wolf. Characters Akazukin Akazukin (Little Red Riding Hood) is a mysterious girl who considers herself immortal. She wants to be eaten by a being known as \\"Mr. Wolf\\" though it seems as if she doesn't even know what Mr. Wolf looks like.Tokyo Akazukin Manga - Vol. 1 Ch. 01: Little Red is seen sleeping with a man she thought to be Mr. Wolf Akazukin works as an organ harvester for Marco, an Italian butcher. The police inspector noted that Akazukin killed 10 known victims in a year alone and harvested their organs. She works for Marco in exchange for a place to stay. Her powers as a whole are a mystery, but she seems to have many different kinds of powers at her arsenal. She's a good shot with a gun as she's demonstrated quite a few times throughout the manga. She can also bring people into her dream world and transform others' bodies (see: Luca). Her hair seems to be a weapon of its own as well. It can extend at will and has the power to crush a human whole. In reality, she's Astarte, the princess of the Demon World. She is also the mother of Mr. Wolf, who had been conceived as a project to restore balance in the world. Her current childlike form (when she was Astarte, she had a more adult body) is the end result of being thrown out from the Demon World after Bettega tricked her and stole her son. She dies in the final pages of the story after sustaining injuries (i.e. losing her left arm and the lower half of her body) during her descent back to Earth after a confrontation with Bettega/Theos. *Akazukin seems to be turned on by pain, making her a masochist, until she turns the tables on whoever hurts her (case in point comes during the 2nd chapter, where she kills the policemen who shot at her face and killed them with her hair). Vivian Vivian (more commonly Vivi) is a four armed assassin who was originally hired by Inspector Gentile to murder Akazukin. During their fight she realized she couldn't defeat Akazukin, so she instead decides to join forces with her. She takes up residence at Marco's butcher shop and accompanies Akazukin on body hunting missions. She notes that before she met Akazukin no one has ever laid eyes on her four arms. Vivi also boasts a flawless record as an assassin, although that was before she fought Akazukin. She's referred to as an \\"artifact\\" by other worldly beings. The title \\"artifact\\" is given to certain people who were failed experiments in creating an artificial host for the being Mr. Wolf. Vivian's name and occupation are contradictions in that her name means \\"vibrant and full of life\\" while her job is to take life. She would represent the hunter in the original story. Luca Luca was formerly an Incubus before Akazukin transformed him into a cat. As an Incubus he was flying through the skies looking for a woman to have sex with, but was having no luck because all he could find were people who already were having sex and he is only into virgins. He found Akazukin sleeping and thought she was a virgin, so he tried sleeping with her, but instead got sucked into her dream world. In Akazukin's dream world she had her way with him and after it was done, transformed him into a cat. She eventually changes him back to human form. *Luca isn't his real name; it was a name given to him by Akazukin. His real name is unknown. He would represent a version of the Wolf in the original story, due to his constant sexual harassment/provocation of Akazukin, although the tables are always turned on him. Asbeel Astarte's loyal servant. When she lost her memories, Asbeel felt sad for her, and thus is forced to walk the Earth. Thanks to him, however, Astarte (as Akazukin) manages to get her memories back after she was shot in the head by Veruno. He remains loyal to her until she dies. Lupo A young orphan who lives in a convent. In reality, he's Astarte's son, Wolf, who Bettega had kidnapped from her. He and his mother (still in her Akazukin form) are finally re-united nearing the end of the story, where she commands her son to eat her (this coming after Lupo kills his friends and other people in the orphanage), thus becoming a huge wolf-like beast. However, this was playing right into the hands of Bettega/Theos, who wanted to create a new world. As a result, Akazukin/Astarte attacks her son, saying \\"You do not belong here, but don't worry; Mama will take care of it\\"; however, Lupo begs his mother not to leave him. During the confrontation, Lupo/Wolf, seeing his mother jump to her certain death, jumps in to try to save her, but ends up dying himself. She and her son are reunited in death in the last pages of the comic. He represents an unwitting version of the Wolf in the original story. Bettega Real name: Theos (God). The one responsible for Astarte being in her current form, and the one who kidnapped her son, Wolf. He's also very manipulative. At the end of the story, he dies in his car from injuries he sustained after descending to Earth. He would represent a much more crueler version of the hunter in the original story. Marco Marco is an Italian butcher who runs his own meat shop called Stomaco Di Ferro (Iron Stomach). He has Akazukin go out and kill people for him for their bodies and organs. This job he gave her pays off her room and board. It seems he sells the meat for it to be eaten like a normal butcher shop, but he also has various body parts decorating the walls of his shop. Marco has many different piercings and tattoos covering his body. He also has a fetish for monsters, which is confirmed when he fell in love with Vivi. He dies after an attack by a squad from heaven. He would represent the Grandmother in the story, except that Marco died without even meeting Lupo/Wolf. Arosa Not much is known about Arosa beside the fact that she's described as a witch and a guru by Mr. Bettega. Marco also calls her a demon in the same ranks as Akazukin. Arosa also seems to be having a budding love relationship with Mr. Bettega. She's the founder of an uprising cult that uses sacrifices from Marco's butcher shop. It's also known that she has some knowledge of magic, through which she created Veruno from various body parts. She is killed by Bettega after it was revealed that he was only using her. Veruno A girl necromancer created by Arosa to be her servant. She makes puppets out of human parts. She was sent to kill Akazukin, but failed and was forced to escape, but not before encountering Bettega, who blinds her. She is killed by Bettega/Theos while she was trying to protect her mistress, Arosa. * Her name comes from a character in the Shiawase no katachi OVA called Beruno Honda. Inspector Gentile Inspector Fabrizio Gentile is a man who is obsessed with capturing Akazukin. He works for the police department and is always pressured for her capture because of all the crimes she has committed throughout the city. After Akazukin gives him the slip one too many times he calls in for Vivi, a four armed professional assassin to murder her. While watching their fight he realizes it's impossible to kill Akazukin and commits suicide. He is later made into a living dead puppet by the necromancer Veruno and told to fight Akazukin (ultimately used as a decoy by her to hold Akazukin down, while Veruno lines up a shot to blow Akazukin's head off; he's also rigged with explosives to incinerate Akazukin after Veruno had blown her head off), but is ultimately defeated by Asbeel. He's last seen near the end of the story in Theos's dream world, behind another door, using a self-made doll in the likeness of Akazukin/Astarte like a sex doll. Like Bettega, he would represent a much more sinister version of the hunter in the original story. Kisa Vanitas An intersex angel sent down with the mission to kill Akazukin (or \\"The girl with the black wings\\", as Kisa refers to her). Kisa wears wings on her arms, which are used as weapons, throwing their feathers as knives, cutting anything it touches. When she faces Akazukin, she and Luca take Kisa into Akazukin's dream world, where they rape her, thus weakening her and then transforming her into a white cat.

The Bingham Canyon area boomed during the first years of the twentieth century, as rich copper deposits in the canyon began to be developed, and at its peak the city had approximately 15,000 residents. The success of the local mines eventually proved to be the town's undoing, however: by the mid-twentieth century the huge open-pit Bingham Canyon Mine began encroaching on the land of the community, causing residents to relocate. By the 1970s, almost the entirety of the town had been devoured by the mine, and the few remaining residents voted to disincorporate and abandon the community. No trace of Bingham Canyon remains today. History The geographic feature known as Bingham Canyon received its name from the location's two first settlers, the brothers Thomas and Sanford Bingham, who arrived in the canyon in 1848. Initially, the area was utilized for livestock grazing and logging, but the region's economic focus changed with the 1863 discovery of rich gold and silver ore bodies in the canyon. Mining activity in Bingham Canyon boomed after the Bingham Canyon and Camp Floyd Rail Road completed a line to the canyon in 1873, and as the region grew the focus shifted to the high-quality copper ores in the district. As the mines grew, the town of Bingham also expanded, spreading along the narrow and steep canyon floor below the mines. The Bingham Canyon mines experienced their greatest boom during the first years of the twentieth century, as the district's smaller mines were consolidated under large corporate ownership. The most significant development occurred in 1903, when Daniel C. Jackling organized the Utah Copper Company to begin surface mining at Bingham Canyon. The Utah Copper Company's mine prospered, and this brought a tremendous influx of new residents into the canyon. The town of Bingham Canyon was officially incorporated on February 29, 1904. By the 1920s, the city of Bingham Canyon was at its peak, with perhaps 15,000 inhabitants. Urban development spread for some seven miles along the single, narrow road winding up the steep canyon floor. As with many western mining towns, the Bingham Canyon area evolved into a collection of diverse neighborhoods, many with pronounced ethnic affiliations. Many Scandinavians lived in the Carr Fork area, while southern and eastern Europeans congregated in Highland Boy, which was in another branch canyon toward the top of the main city. As the mainstreet in the bottom of the canyon grew, Copperfield became the name of the upper section of the main town. Bingham itself attracted British, French, Irish, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and other immigrants and ethnicities. Numerous other small neighborhoods and communities also existed. Most took the name of the mine where they were located. Commercial, Boston Con, and \\"the Niagara\\" were the first three communities to be mined away or covered, as the last one was by Galena Gulch waste dumps. Others were the Galena, Old Jordan, and Silver Shield (these three found in Galena Gulch), along with Niagara. Telegraph was in the upper part of the canyon, along with Copperfield, which was threatened when the mining excavating was expanded and a long one-way tunnel was built before 1940 to allow traffic to reach the upper communities. Many names were colorful: Terrace Heights, Dinkeyville, Jap Camp, and Greek camp were sections of Copperfield. The Frisco, Yampa, Phoenix, and Apex were in Carr Fork along with Highland Boy. Further down the canyon were Markham, Freeman, and Frog Town (lower Bingham). The size and importance of the Bingham community began to fade as early as the 1920s. The canyon's difficult geography made urban development difficult, while exposing the town to the hazards of fire and avalanche. The first effort to reduce settlement in the canyon came in 1926, when Utah Copper established the town of Copperton on the flats east of the canyon mouth. This was a lovely community with many copper products used in the building of the houses, and the low rent encouraged company employees to live there. In 1956, Kennecott sold the homes to employees for $4,800 to $6,000. Increasing mechanization at the mine also reduced local employment‚Äîand hence, Bingham Canyon's population. By the 1930s it was becoming apparent that the most significant threat to the town of Bingham was the mine itself, whose ever-expanding open pit began encroaching on lands formerly occupied by miners' neighborhoods. The mine continued to eat away at Bingham throughout the middle years of the twentieth century, and by 1971 little of the town remained. That November, Bingham Canyon's 31 remaining residents voted 11-2 to disincorporate the town, and the last buildings at Bingham were razed in 1972. Today, most of the land once occupied by Bingham has been consumed by the Bingham Canyon Mine. Panorama of Bingham Canyon, 1925. Photo courtesy of Utah State Historical Society.

Early life and education Rolf was born in New York City in the Bronx on May 19, 1896. An only child, her father, Bernard Rolf, was a civil engineer who built docks and piers on the east coast. Rolf graduated from Barnard College in 1916 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. She was in the Mathematics Club, German Club, Vice President of the class of 1916, a member of the Young Women's Christian Assn., was the alternate for the Graduate Fellowship while working at the Rockefeller Foundation, Business Manager of The Barnard Bulletin, and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She received Departmental Honours in Chemistry at graduation. In 1917 she began her doctoral studies at Columbia University and, concurrently, Rolf also began work at the Rockefeller Institute as a chemical research worker. She was invited back to Barnard College in 1918 to speak to students about \\"work experiences\\". In 1920, Rolf earned her PhD in biological chemistry under the supervision of Phoebus Aaron Theodore Levene, of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Her dissertation was entitled \\"Three Contributions to the Chemistry of the Unsaturated Phosphatides\\", originally printed in three separate issues of \\"The Journal of Biological Chemistry\\", it was again printed in its entirety as a bound book in late 1922, \\"Phosphatides\\". Throughout the decade, she studied yoga and tantra with Pierre Bernard. Career After graduating, Rolf continued to work with Levene at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. In 1918 she was promoted to assistant in the chemistry lab. In 1922, two years after having received her PhD from Columbia, Rolf was raised to associate, then the highest non-tenured position for a scientist at Rockefeller. From 1919 to 1927 she published 16 scholarly journal papers, mostly in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Her research was primarily laboratory studies on biochemical compounds lecithin and cephalin. With the exception of her doctoral dissertation, all of her published work was co-authored with Levene. In 1926, Rolf left her academic work in New York, to study mathematics and atomic physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and also biochemistry at the Pasteur Institute in France. Rolf later developed Structural Integration. In addition to her 16 academic papers published from 1919 to 1927, she would later publish two papers in scholarly journals on structural integration. She had an h-index of 10 with a total number of 299 citations (February, 2007). Structural Integration (Rolfing) Structural Integration (or Rolfing) is a type of manual therapy that claims to improve human biomechanical functioning as a whole rather than to treat particular symptoms.Jacobson, Eric: The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. Volume 17, Number 9, 2011, p.775. Rolf began developing her system in the 1940s. Her main goal was to organize the human bodily structure in relation to gravity. Rolf called her method \\"Structural Integration\\", now also commonly known by the trademark \\"Rolfing\\". Structural integration is a pseudoscience and its claimed benefits are not substantiated by medical evidence.

They resided in Stony Brook, New York, and Manhasset, New York, while raising a family. They had two sons, Alan Michael Demmerle and Richard Rolf Demmerle, a chiropractor and also a Rolfing instructor and practitioner, who was involved in and helped refine and develop his mother's Rolfing project, and who continued her work after her death.

Biography Guilherme de Brito Bollhorst was born in Vila Isabel, a traditional neighborhood with regard to samba, the home of 12 years older Noel Rosa, with whom he was acquainted and who often gave him rides on his car. Brito was the son of Alfredo Nicolau Bollhorst and Marieta de Brito Bollhorst. Guilherme de Brito got a cavaquinho as a present when he was eight; later he became also a violonista. With the death of his father when he was 12, Brito had to drop his studies and start working. He got a job at old Casa Edson, one of the first recording studios to function in Brazil. His aptitude as an artist arose at an early age; when still a boy, he used to draw with pencils and coal. Guilherme de Brito met his most important partner, 11 years older Nelson Cavaquinho, when the latter, already famous and known, used to play in the bars of Rio de Janeiro suburbs. Guilherme de Brito wrote 153 songs, the great majority being sambas, almost all of them in partnership, being 75 with Nelson Cavaquinho. They were recorded by many samba artists besides himself, such as Cartola, Elizeth Cardoso, Paulinho da Viola and especially Beth Carvalho, who had a great reverence for the work of the duo Guilherme de Brito-Nelson Cavaquinho. Some of their most famous songs include \\"A Flor e O Espinho\\", \\"Quando eu me Chamar Saudade\\", \\"Pranto de Poeta\\", \\"Folhas Secas\\" and \\"Minha Festa\\".

History The hospital church The hospital was modelled on the village system of patient care, the best example of which is the Alt-Scherbitz hospital at Schkeuditz in Germany which was developed in the 1870s. It was designed by Hippolyte Blanc and officially opened as the Edinburgh District Asylum in October 1906. At the centre of the site was an Edwardian Baroque hall. The site also incorporated a power station, workshops, a bakery, stores, a kitchen and a laundry. The hospital was requisitioned by the War Office during the First World War but reverted to psychiatric work between the wars. A Romanesque style church, designed by Harold Ogle Tarbolton, was built between 1924 and 1930. During the Second World War the hospital was occupied by the War Office again and the patients were evacuated to Hartwoodhill Hospital Temporary marquees and prefabricated huts were erected to cope with the demand for wartime bed space: the temporary facility became noted for its burns and plastic surgery unit which was established in 1940. After the war the temporary facility was developed as Bangour General Hospital. After general medical services transferred to the newly-opened St John's Hospital in nearby Livingston, Bangour General Hospital closed in the early 1990s. The Village Hospital also started to wind down after the opening of St Johns with the last remaining ward closing in 2004. Railway branch line When the hospital was built, road access was poor, and considerable volumes of coal and general stores were required for the running of the facility. A private railway line was built, branching from the former Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway line at Uphall, and terminating at Bangour railway station. It was authorised by the Edinburgh and District Lunacy Board Act of 30 July 1900, and it was opened to passengers on 19 June 1905., p. 26 During the First World War the road network was improved, and the railway became unnecessary; it was closed on 1 August 1921, although passenger services probably ceased on 4 May 1921.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, Gordon Stansfield, Lost Railways of the Lothians, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2003, Present use The closed hospital was used as a filming location for the 2005 film The Jacket, starring Keira Knightley and Adrien Brody. During September 2009, the hospital grounds were used as the site for \\"Exercise Green Gate\\", a counter-terrorist exercise run by the Scottish Government to test de- contamination procedures in the event of a nuclear, chemical or biological incident. This involved 250 volunteer \\"casualties\\" and 400 emergency staff. On 1 October 2015 Planning Permission for a residential and mixed use redevelopment of the former hospital site is being sought. The application notes some of the listed buildings at the site may be proposed for full demolition in a subsequent application. This may include villas 7,8,9 and 21, with other buildings potentially proposed for partial demolition.

Its route is long and takes guests from Harambe Station in the Africa section to Conservation Station in the Rafiki's Planet Watch section. During the ride, portions of the Animal Kingdom backlot can be seen, including animal holding buildings for rhinos and elephants, among other animals, as well as the roundhouse where the trains are stored. It takes about twelve minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the line: seven minutes from Harambe Station to Conservation Station, and five minutes from Conservation Station to Harambe Station. The railway is built to a narrow gauge, which is smaller than the currently used on East African railways. The full journey is a round trip. The railway is part of the fictitious Eastern Star Railway, running from Lusaka to Nairobi and Kisangani. Despite the dated and weathered appearance of the trains, they are actually brand-new models built by Severn Lamb in Alcester, England. History Early plans for Disney's Animal Kingdom called for a railway that would have taken guests through the Savannah plains. This idea was modified, however, when concerns about the safety of the animals was raised. Instead, Disney decided to create a railway that would take guests from the Village of Harambe in the Africa section of the park to Conservation Station in the Rafiki's Planet Watch section of the park. Imagineer George McGinnis came out of retirement to design the locomotives for the attraction. They were designed to give guests the impression that the trains had been traveling through Africa for a hundred years, collecting grime and rust along the way. Imagineer Joe Rohde stated that the team was \\"creating a look for vehicles that would be seen today in Africa and Asia, long after their original use in Europe in the late 1800s.\\" The locomotives and rail cars themselves were built in 1997 by Severn Lamb, Ltd. in Alcester, England. Production of the locomotives was overseen by Imagineers Bob Harpur and Joel Fritsche. On April 22, 1998, the Wildlife Express Train opened with the rest of Disney's Animal Kingdom. The Wildlife Express Train and Rafiki's Planet Watch were both temporarily closed on October 21, 2018 and reopened on July 11, 2019. Rolling stock The Wildlife Express Train operates three steam-outline locomotives built by Severn Lamb of Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom, in 1997 before the park's opening the following year. The locomotives are all a different color: one red, one black, and one green. These locomotives are based on the L&YR; Class 5 and Class 6 locomotives, designed by John Aspinall, and built in 1898 at Horwich Works in Horwich for the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway in England, which share the same wheel arrangement and body design. The builder's plates of the locomotives, however, state that they were built in 1926 by Beyer, Peacock and Company of Gorton Foundry in Manchester. Their numbers are 02594 (red), 04982 (black), and 00174 (green), with the former carrying the name R. Baba Harpoor, in honor of Imagineer Bob Harpur. The rail line also uses two sets of train cars, each consisting of five coaches with a total seating capacity of 250 people on contoured benches facing sideways per train. The two trains are colored red and green. Both sets contain various bins and items on the roof, representing the luggage that passengers have brought aboard the train.

It was written by George Clinton, Bootsy Collins and Garry Shider, with lead vocals by Clinton. The lyrics consist of mockery of other popular bands, risqu√© nursery rhymes, and stream- of-consciousness-style rapping. Lyrics *The title of the song, sung as \\"let's take it to the stage, sucker\\", is a challenge to other popular bands, inviting them to participate in a \\"battle of the bands\\". (See Cutting contest and Battle rap.) Several bands are \\"called out\\" in the song: **James Brown, known as \\"The Godfather of Soul\\" ‚Äî \\"Talking 'bout you the Godfather. Godmother!

Talley's Negro Folk Rhymes (Wise or Otherwise) (1922): *\\"Tricky Dick wasn't worried about no incriminating Watergate information being on those tapes. That sucker didn't want y'all to dig on him trying to cop an ounce of that P-blow!\\" **President Richard Nixon was often referred to mockingly as \\"Tricky Dick\\". **\\"Watergate\\" was a series of political scandals that involved political espionage and sabotage, illegal break-ins, wiretapping, and obstruction of justice. The Watergate scandal led to Nixon's resignation in 1974. During the Watergate investigation, it was revealed that Nixon had a tape recording system in his White House offices and that he had recorded many conversations. **\\"Incriminating ... information ... on those tapes\\" refers to the mysterious 18¬Ω minute gap that had been erased from the tapes Nixon provided to Watergate investigators. Since the discovery of the gap in 1973, there has been a great deal of speculation regarding the conversation that had been erased, and why it was considered so embarrassing that somebody chose to erase it. **\\"P-blow\\" could refer to P-Funk (that is, Nixon was listening to P-Funk) or cocaine, commonly referred to as \\"blow\\".

Life Macfie was born at 52 Kirkgate in Leith, the son of John Macfie, sugar-refiner, and his wife, Alison Thorburn. He attended Leith High School then the Royal High School in nearby Edinburgh, to which he had won a scholarship. As a schoolboy he displayed particular interest in geology and mineralogy. He left school in 1825 and in October, round about the time of his 15th birthday, he started attending classes at the University of Edinburgh, where he continued his studies till 1827.John Macfie of Edinburgh and his family, pp 17, 37 & 40 In September 1838 he relocated to Liverpool in England, there to establish, in the first instance at a rented refinery in Temple Street, a Liverpool branch of the family sugar business.John Macfie of Edinburgh and his family, pp 91 & 92 In 1877 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Christian H. Millar, David Stevenson (engineer), John Hutton Balfour and Sir Andrew Douglas Maclagan. Around 1880 he purchased Dreghorn Castle near Colinton (south west of Edinburgh) from the Trotter family and made it his family home.http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurehistory8547.html He hosted the King KalƒÅkaua of Hawaii during his 1881 world tour and his niece Princess Ka ªiulani and her Scottish father Archibald Scott Cleghorn in 1892. During the princess' visit, the Hawaiian flag was flown over Dreghorn in her honor. He died on 17 February 1893 at Dreghorn CastleEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1892-93 south-west of Edinburgh. The site was later redeveloped as Dreghorn Barracks. National Politics Macfie stood for election to the British parliament as the Liberal Party candidate in 1859, but failed to be elected. He was more successful in 1868, and from November 1868 to February 1874 he served as a Liberal Party Member of the British Parliament, representing the constituency of Leith Burghs near to Edinburgh.John Macfie of Edinburgh and his family, p 184 Postal reform As a Liberal MP, Macfie took a particular interest in Postal Reform, but long before he entered parliament he held strong views on the subject. As a young businessman based, by now, in Greenock, he responded with characteristic passion and at considerable length, in a letter dated 31 March 1838, to an invitation from a committee of London Merchants to provide information appropriately.John Macfie of Edinburgh and his family, pp 84 & 85 \\"My desire for a change ...was stimulated by ... a domestic servant from the country all whose hard-earned wages did not leave over her needful outlays a surplus sufficient to defray the expense of a monthly letter from home. The question is by no means one of commercial facility chiefly, but one of philanthropy and civilisation. The post office must no longer be a luxury to the rich....How hard it is that in the ordinary course of business men must become smugglers [by breaching the post-office monopoly].\\" His father returning from a business trip to London and finding that Macfie had been \\"meddling in public matters\\" in this way opined strongly that at the age of 26 the son was far too young for this level of involvement, and there is no record of Macfie having challenged his father's judgement nor, in the immediate term, of his having again involved himself in public life.John Macfie of Edinburgh and his family, p85 Family On 17 May 1839 Macfie proposed marriage to Caroline Eliza Easton, daughter of Dr John Easton of Edinburgh. The marriage took place in Edinburgh in January 1840, following what was seen as an unusually long engagement.John Macfie of Edinburgh and his family, pp 97 - 101 The couple produced 7 recorded children, born between 1840 and 1854 in Liverpool where Macfie was by now based.

He attended Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He is the uncle to Minnesota Vikings Linebacker Anthony Barr. Career =College= Brooks, following his older brother Tony, enrolled at the University of Notre Dame in 1989. Originally a defensive back, he converted to tailback for the 1991 season and won a spot in the starting lineup for 1992. During his senior season at Notre Dame, Brooks enjoyed massive success, rushing for 1,372 yards with an 8.0 yards per carry average while scoring 13 touchdowns. He was named an All-American and finished fifth in Heisman Trophy voting that year. *1991: 18 carries for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. 1 catch for 4 yards. *1992: 167 carries for 1,343 yards and 13 touchdowns. 1 catch for 24 yards and 1 touchdown. =Professional= He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the second round of the 1993 NFL Draft. Brooks had a great rookie season with 1,063 rushing yards with a 4.8 average. The rest of his career didn't pan out and he was out of football by the end of the 1996 NFL season. He spent three years with the Redskins and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. =Post-football career= Brooks is employed by Notre Dame as its Director of Student-Athlete Alumni Relations/Engagement. He is also a fixture on Notre Dame's football post-game show and other productions of Fighting Irish Digital Media.http://www.und.com/genrel/brooks_reggie00.html He is married and has five children. Notable performances =The Unconscious Touchdown= He is well known for a 20-yard touchdown run against rival University of Michigan in 1992. After catching a pitched ball on an option-right, Brooks broke six Wolverines tackles, the last of which knocked him unconscious before stumbling across the goal-line and collapsing face- first in the end zone. =The Snow Bowl= The Fighting Irish went up against Penn State in the final home game of 1992. A heavy snowfall throughout the first half made for a highly defensive struggle between the two perennial powerhouse programs. Trailing 16‚Äì9 with 4:25 left in the fourth quarter, senior quarterback Rick Mirer led the Irish on a 64-yard scoring drive, throwing to fullback Jerome Bettis on fourth down for a 3-yard score. Down by one point, Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz opted to go for two points and the win. Mirer dropped back to pass and was forced out of the pocket by the Penn State defense. Brooks, who had lined up as a slot receiver, worked across the field as the two primary receivers on the play were covered. Despite the fact that Brooks only had one reception all season, Mirer lofted the ball towards him in the back corner of the end zone. Brooks made a diving catch and the Irish prevailed 17‚Äì16. He was the winner of the 1995 and 1996 Madden Bowl.

During Easter, eggs would be painted with bright colors, and would be given as gifts, especially to young children or a significant other. Before paint became common, villagers would have to use whatever resources they had available around them to make the dyes and paints themselves. The most common color for eggs was red, due to the abundance of red beets and other vegetables. In the Meƒëimurje area, soot would often be mixed with oak to make a dark brown color. Green plants would be used for green dye. The word pisanica is derived from the Croatian word that means \\"writing.\\" The most common phrase put on pisanicas is Happy Easter, or \\"Sretan Uskrs.\\" Other common decorations are doves, crosses, flowers, traditional designs, and other slogans wishing health and happiness. The day before Easter, Roman Catholics and other Christians go to a late night mass carrying a basket of traditional food (including bread, cheese, and eggs (either pisanicas or regular eggs). During the mass, priests bless the food, which are kept for the next morning to eat. On Easter day, a traditional game is played in which at least two people choose eggs and hold them vertically while one person lightly taps the end of the other egg with their end, to see whose will crack. Anyone whose egg cracks must choose another and then tap the other person's egg, and they continue until all the eggs have been used and cracked but the last one. Whoever holds the strongest egg in the end which has not been cracked, wins.

It was released in Europe on March 23, 2007 and Australia on April 5, 2007 by Rising Star Games. It was released by Ignition Entertainment in North America on February 26, 2008. Plot The story involves Bub and Bob visiting their cousin Bubu (an orange/red bubble dragon) and their grandfather. In the attic of their house, they find a treasure map. They decide to explore the island that Bubu resides on to search for treasure. Gameplay The gameplay uses similar mechanics to the original Bubble Bobble game - the standard way to kill enemies is as usual: blowing a bubble to trap them and then popping the bubble before they can escape. Each stage is laid out over the Nintendo DS's dual screens, so there is no scrolling. The game also supports co-operative multiplayer for multiple DS cards, for up to three players. One of the newest features of Double Shot is the color scheme. Players can switch between Bub, Bob and Bubu on the fly, with each character shooting a different color bubble. As usual, Bub shoots green bubbles, Bob shoots blue bubbles and Bubu shoots red bubbles. However, a gameplay change is that some enemies can only be attacked by a bubble of a specific color, while others require being trapped by two bubbles of different colors. Every 10 levels, there is a boss stage, and there are 100 stages in all. If the player loses all lives, a touch screen minigame must be successfully completed in order to continue. Reception Official Nintendo Magazine criticized the game for lack of seriously new gameplay features, rendering mechanics such as the ability to switch between Bub, Bob and Bubu, and stated that completing a minigame in order to pass a game over was completely pointless; they gave the game 40%.

The original score and songs were composed and conducted by John Barry. Basil Poledouris was originally signed on as composer, based on his work for Lonesome Dove, but left to compose Flight of the Intruder with regular collaborator John Milius. Barry was brought in to replace him; it was his first score in two years since taking a break due to rupturing his esophagus. The score has what he considered his interpretation of what Indian themes would be like. He prepared by listening to American Indian music, but didn't incorporate it into score, believing it should be seen through the protagonist's eyes. Barry and Costner both envisioned a large and romantic score due to the \\"feeling of space\\" in the film. John Barry won the 1991 Academy Award for Best Original Score, and the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television. Barry was also nominated for the 1991 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score (lost to the score of The Sheltering Sky) and the 1992 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music (lost to the score of Cyrano de Bergerac).

It is the sequel to the game Everblue. Arika, the developers of both games, followed it with the spiritual sequel Endless Ocean, for the Wii. The game was also released in North America (with the title still indicating it's a sequel), while the first game was not. Plot Leo is a diver who sails through a fictional treacherous Caribbean sea with his friends. Their ship sinks in a huge storm and they swim to a nearby island. There, they meet a group of scuba divers called The Amigos. While on the island, Leo and the Amigos discover that a nefarious aquatic salvaging company named SeaDross is searching for an ancient pirate treasure called Erebos. Leo and his friends race against time to locate the Erebos, diving to several underwater locations including: a sunken Ferry, a crashed 747, an old cruise ship, a pirate Galleon and an ancient underwater city called Telospolis. The search is cut short when it is discovered that SeaDross has discovered Erebos in Telospolis, however, they failed to realize the malevolent powers contained within the relic causing their submarine (and Erebos) to sink to the ocean depths. At this point the ocean begins to turn stormy as the power of Erebos runs out of control. Leo eventually ventures to the sunken submarine to recover the Erebos and is successful in returning it to Telospolis, calming the oceans. Leo returns to the island as a hero, but his adventures as a diver may just be starting. Gameplay The player, Leo, earns money by finding precious materials with their metal, glass, wood, clay, and stone sonars, and looting artifacts from shipwrecks. This money can be used to buy equipment allowing a player access to deeper and more challenging dives. Over time the player unlocks dive sites such as a sunken freighter, a downed airplane, a pirate ship, a sunken luxury liner, a submarine and an undersea temple.

The 8th seat was elected at-large from the entire state until the 45th Congress, when an 8th district was established as a separate district in the northwestern part of the state.Official Congressional Directory. 45th Congress, 2nd session. 3rd edition. Page 5 (1878) The district occupied an area now held by Alabama's 5th congressional district, with the exception of a portion of Morgan County, which is part of the 4th district. Franklin County, which was part of the 8th district until after the 1890 Census, is also part of the modern 4th district. The district was eliminated in reapportionment at the end of the 92nd United States Congress in 1973. Robert E. Jones Jr. was the district's last representative.

Released as the replacement for the Remington Model 11, it was manufactured from 1949 to 1968 and was produced in 12, 16, 20 and 28 gauge and .410 variations.  Design  A 1953, B-grade on top; a modernized 1949, A-grade \\"truck gun\\" on bottom The Model 11-48 is a long-recoil operated semi- automatic shotgun based on the Model 11, itself based on an 1898 design by John Browning. Shells are stored in a tubular magazine under the barrel. When a chambered shell is fired, the barrel and bolt recoiling together (for a distance greater than the shell length) re-cock the hammer, eject the spent shell, and feed another shell from the magazine into the action. The Model 11-48 was revolutionary in that it ushered in stamped steel components for a lower cost of assembly, and featured truly interchangeable parts not requiring fitting by a gunsmith, and was reliable in the extreme. The impact of these changes can be seen on every Remington shotgun since, and is also prevalent on competitor's models. The Model 11-48 differs from the Model 11 in the shape of its machined steel receiver and the use of less expensive stamped steel internal parts. The easily removable aluminum trigger housing was also featured on its successors. Like the Model 11, the gun operated by way of two return springs. The first, located in the buttstock, serves as the resistance to the bolt. The second spring, located over the magazine tube, serves as the barrel recoil spring, allowing the barrel to recoil several inches into the receiver. The 11-48 differs from the Model 11 in the friction ring placed at the forward end of the barrel recoil spring. The Model 11 had a brass friction ring with one blunt end and one beveled end. The ring fit into a corresponding cut in the barrel underlug. For heavy loads, the ring was turned with the beveled end facing the lug. For lighter loads, the blunt end was turned to face the lug. The 11-48 features a similar friction ring system but is modified to be self-adjusting so as to work with all loads. In 1956, Remington introduced the gas-operated Model 58, which proved more expensive to make than the Model 11-48, and was also less reliable and heavier. Remington chose to replace the Model 58 with a model that combined its best features with those of the Model 11-48. The resulting Model 1100 immediately replaced the Model 58 and proved so successful that it soon also replaced the Model 11-48. Variants The skeet-grade Model 11-48SA had a streamlined look that was designed by John Vassos, RCA's foremost industrial designer, credited with designing radios, broadcast equipment, and the first mass-produced television for RCA seen at the 1939 New York World's Fair. A decorated veteran of World War II, Vassos was chief of the OSS \\"Spy School\\" in Cairo, Egypt, from 1942 to 1945, responsible for training agents sent to Greece, the Balkans, and Italy. The Sportsman '48 was a variant introduced to comply with various American hunting laws that limited shotguns used for hunting to three shells. It came with a crimped magazine tube that allowed it to be loaded with only two shells in the magazine. One additional round placed in the chamber brought its total capacity to three shells. It came in 12, 16, and 20 gauge variations. The dimples pressed into the magazine tube can be removed with a round file from the inside, allowing the magazine to accept a full complement of four shells.  Military use  Small numbers of the Model 11-48 were purchased by soldiers for use in the Korean War. Small numbers were again purchased by soldiers and fielded in the Vietnam War by the United States Marine Corps.

It is also a civil parish in the barony of the same name. It was the location of the castle of the barony, which in historical and official documents is described as Newcastle-Lyons. The area is still primarily rural in nature. History The gradual relaxation of the Penal Laws throughout the UK from 1778 onward culminated in the Relief Acts passed by the British Parliament Catholic Relief Act 1791 and the Irish Parliament in 1793. The eventual achievement of full Catholic Relief was secured during the administration of the Dublin-born hero of the Napoleonic war, the Duke of Wellington. Signed into law by George IV, it proclaimed wide Catholic Emancipation in 1829. This followed a very effective Irish campaign by Daniel O'Connell, 'the Liberator'. In the ensuing general Christian religious revival, it became possible for the reinstated Roman Catholic Church community to build a new church here in the 1830s. The existing pre-reformation Irish Church premises had continued in use as a place of worship by the established Church of Ireland following the schism caused by the divorce of the newly created King of Ireland, Henry VIII. The subsequent church Reformation in the 1550s under Edward and later under Elizabeth I during the Tudor reconquest and plantation of Ireland was only moderately successful. It did not succeed with the majority of the native Irish or Hiberno-Irish leaders or, as a consequence, with their few priests or their generally illiterate followers. The former residential tower fortification of the castle (see thumbnail right) now forms part of the Church of Ireland church building. It was built originally in the late 14th century. There are remains of another 14th-century church in Colmanstown(.). Location and population Newcastle-Lyons is located at the junction of the R120 and the R405 regional roads. It lies approximately 3 km north of the N7 at Rathcoole, 6 km south-east of Celbridge, and 9 km west of Tallaght. The village lies west of Casement Aerodrome (Baldonnell), the HQ of the Irish Air Corps. It features a public house and two churches. Peamount Hospital, a facility for long-term care, is 2 km north of the town centre on the R120. The 2001 census registered a village population of 1,160, but the surrounding area has grown rapidly since then, with the village population doubling by 2010. Transport Newcastle-Lyons is served by the number 311 bus which links it to Tallaght and the Luas Red Line, and the number 68 bus to the city centre. Sport Newcastle-Lyons is home to St Finian's (Newcastle) GAA club () which was founded in 1943. In 1949 the club won the Dublin Intermediate Championship. The club's men's adult team currently plays in division 4 of the Dublin league, with the adult ladies' team playing in the Junior league and championship. Newcastle-Lyons is also home to Peamount United F.C. which was founded in 1983, and is now based in a purpose-built facility in Greenogue. In the 2011‚Äì12 season Peamount United's ladies team became the first Irish club to qualify for the UEFA Women's Champions League. Peamount United's male adult team plays in the Senior 1 division of the Leinster Senior League. The ladies' team plays in the Women's National League.

Running for roughly in a general northeast-southwest direction, it connects the cities and towns of South Whitley, Columbia City and Garrett via SR 327. SR 205 was originally introduced in the mid-1930s routed between South Whitley and Churubusco. The road was extended northeast to the intersection with SR 327 in the mid to late 1940s. Route description SR 205 begins at SR 5 in South Whitley and heads northeast, as a two-lane highway passing through residential. The highway leaves South Whitley and the road curves due east, passing through rural farmland with a few houses. In rural Whitley County the road curves due north, before curving back northeast. The highway enters Columbia City and curves due north. SR 205 is concurrent with Line Street before turning east onto Radio Road. After one block the road turn north onto SR 9, locally known as Main Street. Main Street crosses over the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad tracks and enters downtown Columbia City. The concurrency with SR 9 passes through commercial properties and the Whitley County Court House. At the northeast of the court house is a traffic light with Van Buren Street and SR 205 turns east onto Van Buren Street. The street passes through a mix of residential and commercial properties, before an intersection at U.S. Route 30 (US 30). The highway heads northeast from Columbia City as a two-lane highway, passing through rural farmland with some houses. The route enters Churubusco passing through residential properties. SR 205 is concurrent with Whitley Street through Churubusco, as a two-lane city street, passing mainly residential properties. The street has a traffic light at US 33\\\\. The road leaves Churubusco, still heading northeast, passing through rural farmland with some house. The road is headed for LaOtto, passing through rural Allen and Noble Counties. The route enters LaOtto, passing through residential properties and has an all-way stop with Old SR 3\\\\. As the route begins to leaves LaOtto the road crosses into DeKalb County and has an intersection with SR 3\\\\. The road now enters rural DeKalb County, heading northeast. The northern terminus of SR 205 is at an all-way stop with the southern terminus of SR 327\\\\. The roadway continues east, toward Auburn, as County Road 56 (CoRd 56). The road has access to Interstate 69, via CoRd 11A. No part of SR 205 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other State Roads in Indiana. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 2,290 vehicles and 120 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between SR 5 and Whitley CR 400 West. The peak traffic volumes were 9,370 vehicles and 900 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of SR 205 at is concurrent with SR 9, between the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad tracks and Van Buren Street in Columbia City. History SR 205 had its beginning in 1934 when it was authorized from South Whitley to Churubusco. Construction began in 1936 on this section of roadway and was completed one year later. An extension for SR 205 was proposed in 1936 that proposal would have extended SR 205 northeast to US 27. In 1937 that extension was canceled. The route between Churubusco and Ari was commissioned in 1942. The state highway commission constructed the last section of road between Ari and US 27 (now SR 327), south of Garrett, in 1947.

It was released in 1962 on the United Artists record label. It was Jones' second tribute to the music of Hank Williams. Background Jones's first release on Mercury Records in 1960 had been George Jones Salutes Hank Williams, which features twelve sides made famous by the late country star. My Favorites of Hank Williams includes twelve more recordings in much the same vein, with strict country arrangements, but Jones's voice has matured and is noticeably lower than it was earlier in his career when his vocal style was more derivative of his doomed idol. Jones always cited Hank Williams as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1949, Jones actually met Williams when Hank appeared on KRIC in Beaumont, a radio station where a teenage Jones had secured a gig backing an old time country duet act Eddie and Pearl. In a 2006 television interview with Bill Cody Jones recalled, \\"He had to be the nicest guy I'd ever met in my life, so down to earth...He had a big hit out at the time called 'Wedding Bells'. I was gonna play guitar with him on this radio show...I'm standing on the other side of the mic ‚Äì that's when the mic came out of the ceiling ‚Äì I'm standing there ready to kick it off and instead he starts singin'.

I was amazed.\\" 200px In the 1989 video documentary Same Ole Me, Jones admitted, \\"I couldn't think or eat nothin' unless it was Hank Williams, and I couldn't wait for his next record to come out. He had to be, really, the greatest.\\" In his memoir, Jones recalled learning about Williams death on New Year's Day 1953 while he was serving a stint in the marines stationed in San Jose, California. After a friend showed him the headline in the paper, Jones wrote that he \\"lay there and bawled\\", adding that \\"Hank Williams had been my biggest musical influence.

After serving as a junior officer during the French Revolutionary Wars, Seymour commanded the third-rate HMS Northumberland under Admiral Sir John Duckworth at the Battle of San Domingo during the Napoleonic Wars. He also commanded the sloop HMS Kingfisher at the blockade of Rochefort and the fifth-rate HMS Pallas under Admiral Lord Gambier at the Battle of the Basque Roads. He then saw active service during the War of 1812. Seymour became Third Naval Lord in the Second Peel ministry and went on to be Commander-in-Chief Pacific Station. In late 1844 the French Admiral Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars entered into a confrontation with Queen P≈çmare IV of Tahiti and with the English missionary and consul George Pritchard, expelling the consul and establishing a French protectorate over the territory during the Franco-Tahitian War. This matter became known as the \\"Pritchard Affair\\". Seymour handled this matter tactfully and avoided a confrontation with the French Government who had already denounced Thouars' actions. Seymour later served as Commander-in-Chief North America and West Indies Station and then as Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. Early career Seymour was the eldest son of Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour and Anna Horatia Waldegrave (a daughter of James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave) and joined the Royal Navy in October 1797. He was assigned to the Royal yacht HMY Princess Augusta and then transferred to the third-rate HMS Sans Pareil in the Channel Squadron in March 1798 and to the second-rate HMS Prince of Wales in the West Indies later that year.Heathcote 2002, p. 229 He was present when the Batavian Republic surrendered Suriname to British forces in August 1799 during the French Revolutionary Wars and, having been promoted to midshipman, transferred to the fifth-rate HMS Acasta early in 1800. He joined the fifth-rate HMS Endymion in 1802 and then transferred to the first-rate HMS Victory, flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron, in 1803, to the fourth-rate HMS Madras in February 1804 and, having been promoted to lieutenant on 12 October 1804, to the third- rate HMS Donegal later that month.

Life She was born in 1457 in Brescia, Italy, to Lorenzo de Quinzanis and his wife, who were a poor and pious couple. Her father became a member of the Third Order of St. Dominic while Stephana was very young. While accompanying him on visits to the Dominican monastery in nearby Soncino, she met the stigmatic friar, Matthew Carrieri, O.P., who instructed her in the catechism. Carrieri told her that she would be his spiritual heiress, a statement she did not understand for many years. She began receiving visions of Dominican saints from age seven, at which point she made vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. In a subsequent miraculous experience in 1464, Christ appeared to her, accompanied by Mary and Dominican saints Dominic, Thomas Aquinas, and Catherine of Siena, presenting her with a wedding ring, signifying her mystical marriage. Carrieri died when Stephana was 14 years old; soon after he appeared to her in a vision, and she herself received the stigmata. De Quinzanis started to work as a servant for her living, but she continued in her formation in the Third Order, and at age 15 made her profession at the Dominican priory in Soncino. Her devotion to the poor and sick led her to found a community of Third Order Sisters there. She served as its first prioress. Her counsel was sought by many, including Angela Merici, foundress of the Ursulines, also Augustine Fangi, as well as her fellow Dominican tertiary and mystic, Osanna of Mantua. She participated in various stages of the passion of Jesus Christ, which was attested to by 21 witnesses in 1497 in a still extant account, written in the vernacular, and entitled Relazione dell'Estasi della Passione. Sources state that although Stephana was \\"ugly\\", she had magnificent hair. Grudging herself this one beauty, she pulled it out by the roots. Blessed Stephana depicted on a holy card De Quinzanis had a particularly intense devotion to Saint Thomas Aquinas. In fact, to overcome the temptation of thoughts against purity, she once threw herself upon a cartload of thorns in imitation of the Doctor Angelicus. Exhausted from this penance, she prayed to Saint Thomas, and, according to legend, was girded by angels with a cord, which they tied so tightly around her waist that she cried out in pain. Though she had no formal theological training, she could discuss mystical theology at the most profound level. She is considered a patron saint for theologians. It is said that she could read the hearts and minds of the people around her, and had the gift of prophesy and healing. She lived in a nearly continuous fast. She accurately predicted the date of her own death, which occurred from natural causes on 2 January 1530. Veneration De Quinzanis' tomb became a pilgrimage site almost immediately. Her intercession was often felt in the convent that she had founded, where the sisters obtained both material and spiritual help through her intercession. Her cult was popularized by the Dominicans Bartholomeo of Mantua and Battista of Sal√≤, but their Latin vitae have been lost, and only a later Italian version which combined the two texts has survived.

He was later the third commissioner of the Big Sky Conference. Playing career The son of Russian immigrants, Belko was born in Gary, Indiana, and graduated from Froebel High School. He attended Compton Junior College in southern California for a year, with plans to play basketball at USC, where his older brother Max (1914‚Äì44) starred in football. When the assistant basketball coach at USC that recruited him got the head job at Idaho, also a member of the Pacific Coast Conference, Belko followed Forrest Twogood north in 1936 and hitchhiked over a thousand miles (1600 km) to Moscow. A two-sport athlete for the Vandals, he was a guard and small forward in basketball and a halfback and quarterback on the football team, and a teammate of future coaches Lyle Smith and Tony Knap. As seniors in 1938, they led the Vandals to a record, Idaho's best in years and the last winning season for a quarter century. Belko opted not to play baseball, though he considered it his best sport. A member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and senior class president, he earned a bachelor's degree in education in 1939. Coaching career Following his graduation from Idaho in 1939, Belko was a high school coach in northern Idaho at St. Maries for a season and for three at Lewiston, then served in the U.S. Navy in World War II as a Russian interpreter. Following his military service, Belko briefly returned to Lewiston, then moved to the University of Idaho in Moscow and coached the Vandal freshman teams in football and basketball. =Idaho State= In 1950, Belko was hired as the head basketball coach at Idaho State College in Pocatello, which became a four-year school in 1947. His Bengals soon dominated the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference and made the NCAA tournament in four consecutive seasons (1953‚Äì56). The NCAA tournament field varied from 22 to 25 teams in the mid-1950s. Belko's six- season record at Idaho State was , and he was named the conference coach of the year three times. The Bengals' conference record in his last four seasons was . This success led to his hiring in June 1956 at Oregon, then a member of the Pacific Coast Conference. =Oregon= Belko was the head coach of the Ducks for fifteen seasons and posted a record, with a record in conference play. His teams made the NCAA tournament twice, in 1960 and 1961, as an independent. The 1960 team advanced to the Western regional finals, the national quarterfinals (Elite 8). After five years as an independent, Oregon joined the Pacific-8 Conference (then \\"AAWU\\") for the 1964‚Äì65 season. In February 1970, the Ducks upset three-time defending national champion UCLA at McArthur Court in Eugene, winning 78‚Äì65 to snap the Bruins' 25-game winning streak. Following a pair of 17‚Äì9 seasons, Belko stepped down in April 1971 at age 55 and remained in Eugene as the assistant athletic director at Oregon. Head coaching record Administrator After a year as assistant athletic director, Belko left the Oregon athletic department in 1972 to direct the Far West Classic basketball tournament in Portland for three years. In 1975, he moved to Boise to work for the Big Sky Conference as an evaluator of basketball officials. Belko was named commissioner of the conference in December 1976 and served from 1977 to 1981.

It was released in 1962 on the United Artists record label. Background Jones's fondness for gospel music is well documented. In the 1989 documentary Same Ole Me, he recalls that he learned how to play the guitar at the church where his mother Clara, a devout woman, played piano. The church was run by Brother Burl Stephens (with whom Jones would credit as co- writer of several songs on his 1959 gospel album Country Church Time) and Sister Annie, who George remembered \\"taught me my first chords on the guitar, like C, G, and D and things like that, and I started hangin' out over there more often. She'd get her guitar and we'd pick and sing together...We used to do all the really old gospel songs.\\" Jones love of gospel music actually predated his exposure to country music, which he would not hear until his family acquired their first radio. Jones would continue to record gospel albums throughout his career, including Old Brush Arbors (1965), In a Gospel Way (1974) and The Gospel Collection (2003). \\"Someone's Watching Over You\\" was written by J.P. Richardson (otherwise known as the Big Bopper) who also wrote \\"White Lightnin',\\" which was Jones's first number one country hit in 1959. The album is also noteworthy for featuring a Willie Nelson composition called \\"Kneel At The Feet Of Jesus\\". \\"Wandering Soul\\" was Jones's only songwriting credit on this album, which he had co-written with Bill Dudley several years before and had recorded previously.

The Hospice, one of two main hospice organisations in Dublin, provides care in a region with a population of c. 500,000 people. History / Service Development St. Francis Hospice began when the Irish Hospice Foundation approached the Daughters of Charity (of St. Vincent de Paul) in 1988, seeking help to establish a home care service for northern Dublin. Supported by many individuals and organisations, the service developed over following years. The service began with a Home Care initiative from 1989, originally based in a temporary building in the grounds of the Capuchin Friary on Station Road, Raheny, providing specialist advisory and support services to patients and their families in their own home. This service continues. The Capuchins later donated their friary garden for the building of a permanent Hospice, allowing construction to start in 1993 - delivering an office and meeting space for the Home Care team and a purpose- built Hospice Day Care Centre. The Day Care service commenced that year. St. Anne's In-Patient Unit, a 19-bed facility, opened on a phased basis between 1995 and 1997, allowing patients to be admitted for respite care and symptom control, and when there is a need for specialist care and support in the terminal phase of their illness. In the next stage of development, the adjoining \\"big house\\", Walmer House, was purchased, and then further building was completed, leading to the opening in 2002 of a new Hospice Day Care, Bereavement Counselling facility and Centre for Continuing Studies. Planned service for Dublin North West The Hospice has been looking since 2003 for a new site in the western part of its catchment area, to facilitate a second base for its Home Care Team, and another Hospice Day Care facility (in the same way as Our Lady's Hospice, Harolds Cross, founded Blackrock Hospice). Access The Hospice receives referrals for people with cancer or motor neurone disease and all services are available at no cost to residents of North Dublin City and County regardless of their financial, social or religious status. Bereavement support is offered and is available to relatives and friends; social work staff are also available to work with bereaved children. Funding Partial funding for the service comes from various sources, including the Health Service Executive and its predecessor organisations, the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society and local support groups - and the Hospice notes that it depends to a large extent on charitable contributions. RT√â In early 2007, the national TV broadcaster, RT√â, screened a multi-week documentary about the work of the Hospice, and its clients, with individual stories.

She is best known for her work with her husband Myles Horton at the Highlander Folk School where she is generally credited with turning such songs as \\"We Shall Overcome\\", \\"We Shall Not Be Moved,\\" and \\"This Little Light of Mine\\" from hymns into protest songs of the Civil Rights Movement. Early life Zilphia was born Zilphia Mae Johnson in the coal mining town of Spadra, Arkansas. She was the second child of Robert Guy Johnson and Ora Ermon Howard Johnson. Her father was superintendent of the local coal mine which he later owned and operated, and her mother was a school teacher. While some sources describe her as being of mixed Spanish and Native American heritage., others describe her as white.  Education and career  She was a graduate of the College of the Ozarks University of the Ozarks, where she was trained as a classical musician. After graduating, Horton was determined to use her talents for the better good of the southern working class. Her political interest was awakened by the Presbyterian minister, Claude C. Williams, who attempted to organize her father's workers for the Progressive Miners' Union. She joined the unionization efforts despite her father's disapproval and was disowned by him as a result. In 1935, she attended a workshop at the Highlander Folk School, a social justice leadership training school and cultural center located in Monteagle, Tennessee. Horton arrived at Highlander Folk School, now known as the Highlander Research and Education Center, committed to the idea that music and drama could help organize labor. Months after attending her first Highlander workshop, she married the school's founder, Myles Horton, and began working for the Highlander Folk School. Zilphia Horton had numerous roles at Highlander Folk School, serving as music and drama director from 1938 to 1956.Massie-Legg, Alicia R. (2014). \\"Zilphia Horton, A Voice For Change\\". Ann Arbor: University of Kentucky. p. 6. She enhanced the cultural pluralism of the school by developing a curriculum which incorporated and elevated the importance of folk music, dance, and drama. She directed workers' theatre productions, junior union camps, and various community programs; organized union locals; and led singing at workshops, picket lines, union meetings, and fund-raising concerts. She had students collect folk songs, religious music, and union songs around the South, which she then re-wrote or re-worked into protest songs to serve in political struggles, including labor movements and the Civil rights movement. Ludlow 1960 version, with \\"new words and music arrangement,\\" by Zilphia Horton, Frank Hamilton, and Guy Carawan She is perhaps best known for teaching Pete Seeger an early version of \\"We Shall Overcome,\\" which would become an important civil rights anthem of the twentieth century. Originally an old Baptist hymn, \\"I Will Be All Right,\\" the song came to Highlander from the picket lines of the 1945 American Tobacco Company strike by the South Carolina CIO Food and Tobacco Workers Union in Charleston. Other musicians credited with transforming the song are Frank Hamilton, Guy Carawan, Candie Carawan, and Pete Seeger.  Personal life  Zilphia and Myles Horton had two children. On April 11, 1956, she died after accidentally drinking a glass of typewriter cleaning fluid containing carbon tetrachloride she mistook for water. Zilphia Horton's papers are deposited in the Tennessee State Library and Archives in Nashville. References Further reading * Glen, John M. 2018-03-01. Zilphia J. Horton. Tennessee Encyclopedia.

WSJM-FM began broadcasting in stereo on 107.1 MHz in 1965 and regularly provided stereo remote broadcasts by the Twin Cities Symphony and other events. In 1969, the station changed its call letters to WIRX(FM) and switched to a completely jockless, automated Country format, tagged \\"WIRX Country.\\" 1979 began the AOR/Top 40 a.k.a. Rock 40 format for the station and dubbed \\"The All New Rock 107 WIRX, The Music Works\\" playing artists from both the current and past years of rock. The station switched its format slightly to a more AC- leaning rock format and was rebranded as \\"The New Magic 107 WIRX\\" with Jim Gifford and The Champions of Breakfast'as the morning show. WIRX returned to their roots as \\"Rock 107 WIRX\\" in 1991 and began running a mainstream rock format, which it continues to do to this day. The station is managed on a local level to this day, much as it was when it first came on the air. Morning shows The station has had several morning shows, including most recently the Free Beer and Hot Wings show syndicated from Grand Rapids. Previously, the station had aired local shows from Jim Gifford and the Champions of Breakfast, Brian Maloney with Bob Dewitt (news) John Jay, Kluck and The Jason Lee Show. In June 2011, the station made a switch back to local content, culminating with Drew Scott. Engineering and design It is thought that WSJM-FM was one of the world's first completely automated radio stations, built and designed by Brian Brown in 1963 when Brown was only 10 years old. The station broadcast in a classical format, called \\"More Good Music (MGM)\\" and five-minute bottom-of-the-hour news feeds from the Mutual Broadcasting System. The heart of the automation was an 8 x 24 telephone stepping relay which controlled two reel-to-reel tape decks, one twelve-inch Ampex machine which provided the main program audio and a second RCA seven-inch machine which provided \\"fill\\" music. The tapes that these machines played were originally produced in the MWF's Madison, Wisconsin production facility by WSJM Chief Engineer Richard E. McLemore (and later in-house at WSJM) with special sub-audible cue tones used to signal the end of a song. The stepping relay was \\"programmed\\" by slide switches in the front of the two relay racks which housed the equipment. The news feeds were triggered by a microswitch which was attached to a Western Union clock and tripped by the minute hand of the clock. and then reset the stepping relay. Originally, 30-minute station identification was accomplished by a simulcast switch in the control booth for sister station WSJM, whereupon the disc jockey in the booth would announce \\"This is WSJM-AM and... (then pressing the momentary contact button) ...WSJM- FM, St. Joseph, Michigan.\\" This only lasted about six months, however, and a standard tape cartridge player was wired in to announce the station identification and triggered by the Western Union clock.

It is therefore considered a bedroom community to these cities.  History  LaOtto was established in the 1830s as settlers headed north out of Fort Wayne, Indiana along the Mongoquinong Trail, which would later become Lima Plank Road. From 1856 to 1861, LaOtto was called Simon's Corners, a name taken from the local U.S. Post Office (and so named by cabinet maker and first Postmaster John Miller). Simon's Corners became Simonsville. From 1872 to 1875 it was called Grand Rapids Crossing, because it was the intersection of the north-south Grand Rapids & Indiana Railroad and the east-west Eel River Railroad lines and the railroad did not like the name Simonsville. In 1875, the name LaOtto was proposed and petitioned by Lutheran minister Rev. B.F. Shultz and approved by the Noble County commissioners.\\"LaOtto\\" from Ancestry.com Though LaOtto is a small unincorporated community, it played a role in the fight against slavery.

It was released in 1962 on the United Artists Records. Background George Jones Sings Bob Wills was Jones first album with United Artists after leaving Mercury Records. 1962 was a coming out of sorts for the singer; he charted seven records, the biggest being the number one smash \\"She Thinks I Still Care\\", and would establish himself as one of country music's biggest stars. A Texas native himself, Jones was well aware of the music Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys which, in the early 1960s, ranked alongside of Hank Williams in popularity and its ability to be reinterpreted in continuously fresh fashions. The album was produced by H.W. \\"Pappy\\" Daily, who had also been guiding Jones's career since his start in 1954. Reception Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gives George Jones Sings Bob Wills a glowing review, noting \\"Where some Wills tributes are faithful to a fault, Jones, as produced by Pappy Daily, plays these songs as hardcore honky tonk, occasionally informed by Western swing, but only as a coloring device. He is singing these songs in his signature pure country style, and the results are pretty terrific, not only because this is the hardest country he cut at United Artists, fueled by a crackerjack band playing at its peak, but because these are tremendous songs that are open to such a sly reinterpretation as given to them by Jones and Daily.\\" In his 1994 article \\"The Devil in George Jones\\", Nick Tosches singled out Jones's singing on \\"Warm Red Wine\\" for particular praise, \\"the pure, stark sincerity with which he delivered the lament 'I'm a prisoner of drink who will never escape' that was uncommonly disquieting. It was more than a testimony to the power of his singing; it seemed a personal testament, a wail from the abyss, as well.\\" Track listing #\\"Bubbles in My Beer\\" (Tommy Duncan, Cindy Walker, Bob Wills) ‚Äì 2:20 #\\"Faded Love\\" (Johnnie Lee Wills, B.

Nomadik is a family of microprocessors for multimedia applications from STMicroelectronics. It is based on ARM9 ARM architecture and was designed specifically for mobile devices. On December 12, 2002, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments jointly announced an initiative for Open Mobile Application Processor Interfaces (OMAPI) intended to be used with 2.5 and 3G mobile phones, that were going to be produced during 2003. (This was later merged into a larger initiative and renamed the MIPI alliance.) The Nomadik was STMicroelectronics' implementation of this standard. Nomadik was first presented on October 7, 2003 in the CEATEC show in Tokyo, and later that year the Nomadik won the Microprocessor Report Analysts' Choice Award for application processors. The family was aimed at 2.5G/3G mobile phones, personal digital assistants and other portable wireless products with multimedia capability. In addition it was suitable for automotive multimedia applications. The most known device using the Nomadik processor was the Nokia N96 which used the STn8815 version of the chip.

TRAC was proposed by a group called Team Sports and Entertainment Inc., whose shareholders included Cale Yarborough, a three-time winner of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series season title, television executive Robert Wussler; and former college football coach Danny Ford. Among the series' board members includes former Cup team owner Michael Kranefuss. Bill Miller was named chief executive officer of Team Sports Entertainment Inc. and its subsidiary, the Charlotte-based Team Racing Auto Circuit. Miller is the chairman of Miller Industries Inc., a provider of vehicle towing and recovery equipment and services.Charlotte Business Journal January 22, 2002 Premise The concept of TRAC was to put teams of drivers, particularly 8‚Äì12 two-driver teams, in identically prepared cars that were said to be similar to the muscle cars produced by Detroit. Some of the cars that were scheduled to compete included the Chevrolet Corvette, the Dodge Viper, and the Ford Mustang. All entries were to be equipped with Riley & Scott-designed chassis and fuel- injected V8 engines supplied and sealed (to prevent tampering) by a designated vendor. The race tracks planned were primarily ovals with capacities of at least 50,000 people. Teams, representing various tracks throughout the country, would accumulate points in each race for each driver, presumably based on the order of finish. The plan called for regular season races, playoffs, and a championship. TRAC had a contract from ESPN to televise the races. Raycom Media handled marketing and sold advertising, and Yarborough was the league's spokesman. The series held a test at Atlanta Motor Speedway in April 2002 with Andy Hillenburg and Tony Ave driving the cars. Four months later, at Lowe's Motor Speedway, Ave and Boris Said tested the cars. Fall TRAC was unable to sell sponsorships for any of the proposed teams, prompting the series' debut to be postponed to 2004, but the league ultimately folded without conducting a single race. The end of TRAC was officially announced on August 26, 2003. In 2004, Team Sports and Entertainment was sued by four shareholders for \\"breach of contract, wrongful conversion of company monies, mismanagement, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.\\" References External links * Information on the series Category:Defunct auto racing series ","title":"Team Racing Auto Circuit"},{"id":"10525892","text":"Medical literature retrieval or medical document retrieval is an activity that uses professional methods for medical research papers retrieval, report and other data to improve medicine research and practice.

Former Memphis Showboats owner William Dunavant, Paul Tudor Jones, Fred Smith and Elvis Presley Enterprises were the members of the potential ownership group. In 1993, the NFL invited potential owners from four finalists to make a presentation, after which two teams would be selected as expansion teams. Along with representatives from the Jacksonville Jaguars, Carolina Cougars, Baltimore Bombers and St. Louis Stallions, the potential franchise owners gave a presentation to NFL owners in hopes of attracting an NFL team. Carolina (later renamed the Panthers) and Jacksonville were chosen to become expansion teams and started in 1995. After the NFL bid failed, Smith continued his desire to form a football team and contacted the Canadian Football League, then expanding into the United States, who gave him an expansion franchise that would be known as the similarly named Memphis Mad Dogs (the name change is presumably due to Presley's estate not being involved in the franchise). The Mad Dogs played one year in the CFL, but after weeks of declining attendance, the Mad Dogs folded, along with the rest of the American CFL franchises (except the defending champion Baltimore Stallions, who shifted their resources to the then-mothballed Montreal Alouettes franchise). All five of the proposed expansion cities would get NFL teams by 1997 through expansion (Carolina and Jacksonville) or moved franchises (Los Angeles Rams to St. Louis and the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore); however, Memphis's was only temporary, as they hosted the Tennessee Oilers for only one year while Nashville worked out stadium issues. (The original plan was for Memphis to host the Oilers for two years while the Nashville stadium was built, but the city's fans rejected the team, and dismal attendance figures forced an early move to a smaller Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville.) Yet Memphis would not be without a professional sports team for long, as the Vancouver Grizzlies of the NBA would relocate there in 2001 to become the Memphis Grizzlies, who have remained there since.

The route runs from the New Jersey state line on the Burlington‚ÄìBristol Bridge over the Delaware River outside Bristol, where the road continues as Route 413 into New Jersey, north to PA 611 in Bedminster Township. The route passes through the lower and central portions of Bucks County, serving Bristol, Levittown, Langhorne, Newtown, and Buckingham. The route intersects U.S. Route 13 (US 13) and Interstate 95 (I-95) near Bristol, I-295 near Penndel, US 1 in Langhorne Manor, and US 202 in Buckingham. The modern-day alignment of PA 413 roughly follows the Durham Road, an 18th- century road that connected Bristol to upper Bucks County. PA 413 was originally designated in 1928 to run from US 309 (Main Street) in Sellersville east to PA 113 in Blooming Glen. The route was extended to US 122 (now US 202) in Buckingham by 1930. In 1946, the northern terminus was moved to US 611 in Pipersville, with portions of the route between Sellersville and Pipersville becoming parts of PA 113 and PA 152. The route was also extended south to US 13 in Bristol by this time, replacing PA 101 between Bristol and Penndel and PA 113 between Penndel and Buckingham. The route was extended south to its current terminus and moved to its current alignment between Bristol and Penndel by 1950. In 1977, PA 413 was routed to bypass Newtown. Route description PA 413 northbound past Trenton Road in Middletown Township PA 413 begins at the Burlington‚ÄìBristol Bridge over the Delaware River in Bristol Township, Bucks County, where the road continues south into the city of Burlington, New Jersey as Route 413. From the bridge, PA 413 heads north as two-lane undivided Veterans Highway, passing over the abandoned Maple Beach community before curving northwest and back north through woodland. The route heads into industrial areas and widens into a four-lane road, bending northeast and crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Bristol Industrial Track at-grade. PA 413 turns northwest at an intersection with Otter Street and passes under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor before it reaches a junction with US 13. Past this intersection, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes between homes to the west and a shopping center to the east, at which point it forms the border between Bristol Township to the west and the borough of Bristol to the east. The route fully enters Bristol Township again and continues through residential areas with a few businesses as a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane, passing to the west of the Lower Bucks Campus of Bucks County Community College. PA 413 becomes a six-lane divided highway as it comes to a ramp that provides access to I-95 to the west. Following this, the route reverts to a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane and runs through commercial areas. PA 413 becomes a four-lane divided highway before it passes under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-95) and narrows into a two-lane undivided road. The road gains a center left-turn lane and passes businesses as it forms the western border of the planned residential community of Levittown. At the New Falls Road intersection, the route enters Middletown Township and runs between apartment complexes to the west and woods to the east as a two-lane road. The road heads through residential areas with occasional businesses along the western edge of Levittown, crossing Trenton Road and Mill Creek as it continues north to an intersection with US 1 Bus. PA 413 northbound past PA 213 in Langhorne At this point, PA 413 turns southwest to form a concurrency with US 1 Bus. on four-lane divided Lincoln Highway, immediately reaching a diamond interchange with I-295. Past this interchange, the roadway crosses Mill Creek again and continues as a four-lane undivided road, passing through commercial areas and crossing into the borough of Penndel. In Penndel, PA 413 splits from US 1 Bus. by turning northwest onto two-lane undivided Durham Road. A block later, the route intersects the northern terminus of PA 513 and heads north on Bellevue Avenue. The road crosses CSX's Trenton Subdivision and SEPTA's West Trenton Line at-grade east of the Langhorne station serving the SEPTA line and enters the borough of Langhorne Manor. Here, PA 413 runs north-northwest through wooded residential areas. The route turns east onto four-lane undivided Pine Street, with Bellevue Avenue continuing north to provide access to and from the northbound lanes of the US 1 freeway to PA 413. PA 413 curves north, crossing back into Middletown Township, and comes to a bridge over US 1 before it intersects Gillam Avenue, which along with connecting Bellevue Avenue provides access to and from the southbound lanes of US 1 to PA 413. Following this intersection, the road heads into the borough of Langhorne, narrowing back into a two-lane undivided road and heading into residential areas. The route crosses PA 213 in the center of Langhorne and passes near some businesses before heading past more homes. PA 413 crosses back into Middletown Township, where the name changes to Newtown Langhorne Road, and passes under Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line and an abandoned railroad line before heading into wooded areas along the eastern bank of the Neshaminy Creek and curving northwest. The road curves back to the north away from the creek and passes by residential subdivisions a short distance to the west of Core Creek Park. The route heads to the west of St. Mary Medical Center before running past more homes. PA 413 passes between the George School to the west and farm fields and neighborhoods to the east before it comes to the PA 332 intersection. PA 413 northbound along with westbound PA 332 and northbound PA 532 on the Newtown Bypass Here, PA 413 turns west to join PA 332 on the four-lane divided Newtown Bypass, with State Street continuing north into the borough of Newtown. The bypass heads through wooded areas in Newtown Township and comes to a bridge over the abandoned Fox Chase/Newtown railroad line and Freedom Drive before passing over Newtown Creek. The road curves northwest and intersects PA 532, at which point PA 532 joins PA 332/PA 413 on the Newtown Bypass. The highway turns north and passes through wooded areas with nearby residential development. PA 332 splits from the Newtown Bypass by heading west on Richboro Road while PA 413/PA 532 continue to the north on the bypass. The roadway passes over an access road to Council Rock High School North before it heads to the east of Tyler State Park, curving to the northwest. At the entrance to the park, PA 413/PA 532 turn northeast to remain on the Newtown Bypass while Swamp Road heads to the northwest. The road passes between a residential development to the northwest and a shopping center to the southeast before the Newtown Bypass ends at an intersection with Durham Road, at which point PA 413 heads north on Durham Road and PA 532 heads east on Durham Road. From this point, PA 413 continues northwest as a two-lane undivided road, passing residential subdivisions before continuing into a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. The road heads to the southwest of the residential development of Newtown Grant before it crosses into Wrightstown Township, where it passes through the community of Wrightstown. The route runs through more rural areas with some development, crossing PA 232 in the community of Penns Park. Past this intersection, PA 413 continues through more farm fields, woods, and housing areas, crossing into Buckingham Township at the Township Line Road/Pineville Road intersection in the community of Pineville. The road continues northwest through agricultural and wooded areas, passing to the north of the residential community of Buckingham Springs. The route passes through forested areas with some development and runs a short distance to the east of the New Hope Railroad, curving north and crossing the railroad line at-grade. PA 413 heads to the northwest again through farmland and crosses Lahaska Creek before it comes to an intersection with PA 263 (York Road) in the community of Buckingham. The route becomes a divided highway at this point and crosses US 202 a short distance later. Past US 202, PA 413 becomes a two- lane undivided road again, continuing northwest through wooded areas with some fields and homes. The road passes through the community of Mechanicsville and runs through more rural areas with some suburban residential subdivisions. The route heads into Plumstead Township after the intersection with Landisville Road and Ridgeview Drive and continues to the community of Gardenville, where it crosses Point Pleasant Pike. From here, PA 413 continues north into more rural surroundings, passing through farmland with some patches of woods, crossing the North Branch Neshaminy Creek and Geddes Run before passing through the community of Hinkletown. The road curves to the northwest and becomes the border between Bedminster Township to the west and Plumstead Township to the east before fully entering Bedminster Township. The route passes through more rural areas, crossing Cabin Run, before it comes to the community of Pipersville. Here, PA 413 turns southwest onto Old Easton Road, at which point it follows State Route 1013 (SR 1013), an unsigned quadrant route. A short distance later, the route turns west onto Deep Run Road and reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 611. Deep Run Road continues southwest from here as part of SR 1013. History The precursor to present-day PA 413 was Durham Road, a road built in the 18th century that linked Bristol with upper Bucks County. Durham Road was extended from Bristol to close to the Delaware River near Durham Furnace in the early 1720s. The road was later extended to the Lehigh River past Durham. The Durham Road split into several branches in upper Bucks County, connecting to Bethlehem and Easton. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the Durham Road was legislated as Legislative Route 152 between Bristol and Buckingham. In addition, what would become PA 413 was legislated as Legislative Route 154 between Sellersville and Blooming Glen. PA 101 was designated along Durham Road between US 13 in Bristol and US 1 and PA 113 in South Langhorne by 1927. PA 413 was designated in 1928 to run from US 309 (Main Street) in Sellersville east through Perkasie to PA 113 in Blooming Glen. By 1930, the route was extended east from Blooming Glen to US 122 (now US 202), PA 113, and PA 263 in Buckingham. The extended route headed northeast along a concurrency with PA 113 to Kulps Corner, where PA 113 split to the southeast. PA 413 continued northeast to an intersection with US 611, where it headed south for a concurrency with that route to Pipersville. At Pipersville, PA 413 headed southeast along Durham Road to Buckingham. By 1940, PA 413 was paved between Kulps Corner and US 611 and between Pipersville and Buckingham. In 1946, the northern terminus of PA 413 was moved from Sellersville to the US 611 intersection in Pipersville. The former route between Sellersville and Pipersville became an extended PA 152 between Sellersville and Perkasie, unnumbered South Perkasie Road and Blooming Glen Road between Perkasie and Blooming Glen, and a rerouted PA 113 between Kulps Corner and US 611. In addition, the southern terminus was extended from Buckingham to US 13 in Bristol. The route replaced the entirety of PA 101 between Bristol and Penndel and part of PA 113 between Penndel and Buckingham. By 1950, PA 413 was realigned to bypass Bath Road and Durham Road on its current alignment between Bristol and Penndel. In addition, the route was extended south from US 13 to the Burlington‚ÄìBristol Bridge, replacing PA 713. In 1977, PA 413 was rerouted to bypass Newtown to the west on the Newtown Bypass. The former alignment of PA 413 in Newtown followed State Street, Washington Street, Sycamore Street, and Durham Road. In 1991, PA 332 and PA 532 were also routed to bypass Newtown following an extension of the bypass. Also, the northern terminus of PA 413 at PA 611 was moved to its current location at Deep Run Road instead of where Durham Road intersected PA 611. On May 9, 2002, the section of PA 413 along New Rodgers Road between US 13 in Bristol Township and US 1 Bus. in Middletown Township was renamed the Veterans Highway by an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. On April 22, 2014, the portion of PA 413 along the Newtown Bypass was renamed the Officer Gregg Memorial Bypass in honor of Brian S. Gregg, a borough of Newtown police officer who was killed in the line of duty on September 29, 2005. Major intersections PA 413 Truck Pennsylvania Route 413 Truck signs are posted to direct motorists from southbound PA 611 directly to southbound PA 413 in Bedminster Township in Bucks County, avoiding Old Easton Road.

Biography Since June 1990, Batkov has been a managing partner of the Batkov, Stoev, Botev and Co. company of lawyers. He is a member of the College of Barristers, the International Lawyer's League and the Supervising Council of Mobiltel. Batkov is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Standard News Ltd, publisher of the Standart newspaper. Batkov was also formerly a legal adviser at the Bulgarian Council of Ministers. Batkov has been the president of Levski Sofia since the summer of 1998, becoming the de facto owner as the majority shareholder of the team in March 2004 when he officially replaced Michael Cherney in that capacity. Batkov stepped down on 24 June 2015, with three businessmen (Ivo Tonev, Aleksandar Angelov and Nikolay Iliev) obtaining his shares in the team. He remains the longest serving president of Levski Sofia in the club's history. On 30 March 2006, Batkov caused controversy when in the post-match interview following Levski Sofia's 1‚Äì3 home defeat against German side FC Schalke 04, he said that English people referee Mike Riley was a \\"British homosexual [who] broke the game!\\" (Bulgarian: \\"–¢–æ–∑–∏ –±—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ø–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Å—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∞–ª–∏ –º–∞—á–∞!\\"), referring to the red card Riley gave to Sofia midfielder C√©dric Bardon. Batkov was subsequently fined 5000 Swiss francs and banned from attending the next 2 Levski games in any UEFA tournaments. In August 2008, some of his remarks in relation to the identity of the BATE Borisov football team as well as the country of Belarus attracted criticism among the press and a number of politicians in the former Soviet state. On 17 October 2008, Batkov was awarded the Order of Stara Planina (1st class) by then president Georgi Parvanov for his contributions to the preservation of Bulgarian cultural heritage and the enhancement of the reputation of Bulgarian sport.

Animation was by Dick Thompson, Philip Roman, Ben Washam, Hal Ambro, Don Towsley and Carl Bell, with layouts by Don Morgan and backgrounds by Philip DeGuard. The cartoon's title is play on the word \\"surfboard\\". Plot The title card and credits are first shown. As Tom and Jerry are on a cruise ship heading to a tropical Caribbean beach, Tom looks out the window seeing a surfer riding a wave. Tom leaps for joy grabs his surfboard and takes of running, accidentally waking up Jerry. Tom tries to run with his surfboard out to the deck, but it jams in the door several times before he gets through. Then he takes a running leap, jumps onto his board, flying over the edge of the ship, and sails onto... the pier. He shrugs, picks it up, takes off again and doing the same thing, lands... on medium-sized boat, and again until he finally makes it to the sea out of a row boat. Tom then lands on a large blue lump, which turns out to be a shark. Tom peers over at the other of surfers and hits the shark in the head, knocking it out. Tom surfs a large wave but spots the interrupting shark below him, laughing demonically. Tom pulls himself up to the top of the wave but wipes out. He bursts out of the surface with the shark pursuing him. Tom speeds away from the shark, launching himself a foot into the air. He taunts the shark but scrapes the sand and runs into a rock. As a mound of sand covers him, the surfboard hits the rock, giving the mound the appearance of a grave. Jerry walks to the \\"grave\\", drops a flower onto it, and takes off his hat as a salute. Tom's hand then emerges from the grave and grabs Jerry before he sits up, the flower in his mouth, which he spits out. As Jerry laughs sheepishly, the sand on top of Tom's head falls away and reveals that red starfish has latched onto his head. The starfish enlarges one of its legs on Tom's nose and does an impression of Jimmy Durante. After that, Tom tries to get the starfish off of his head by tugging him off, but doesn't succeed, much to Jerry's amusement. Tom eventually gets the starfish off to his head, but it latches onto his hands. He tries to get the starfish off by pushing it with his foot. Tom succeeds, but he doesn't notice that the starfish is now stuck on his foot until he starts walking. He tries to pull the starfish off, but it latches onto his head again. Jerry whispers into Tom's ear a plan: run into the rock headfirst. Despite the starfish's protests, Tom carries out the plan and hits the rock with his head. Tom, noticing that the starfish is still on his head, cries while pointing at it and the rock. Just then, a bump forms on Tom's head, causing the starfish to jump off from Tom's head and run away, yelping happily. Tom celebrates, until he notices Jerry has stolen his surfboard. While the surfboard sails along, Jerry does a sombrero dance with his hat, puts the hat back on and poses one foot at the very front of the board. But Tom takes the surfboard and waves goodbye at the mouse. Jerry flies through the air and lands into a coconut tree. Jerry gets his head lodged in a coconut and acts like a monkey. Tom paddles away but encounters the shark yet again. Tom jumps off his surfboard and swims to shore, causing the board to fly into the shark's mouth, and stick out of the end of his tail. As Tom laughs, the board slingshots itself out of the shark and into Tom's mouth when he's laughing, causing him to swallow, and become shaped like his surfboard. The shark laughs hysterically at Tom's predicament and departs. Jerry takes \\"Surfboard Tom\\" out to ride the waves. At first, Tom looks irritated, but when he realizes he is doing what he has wanted to do all along, a reluctant grin comes over his face, and he and Jerry zoom along enjoying the wave as the cartoon irises out.

Melville biographer Hershel Parker suggests that the work, perhaps a novel, perhaps a story, was what had been known as the \\"story of Agatha,\\" completed around May 1853. He further suggests that finishing the work showed that Melville had not, as many biographers argued, been discouraged and turned away from fiction. Unlike almost all of Melville's other fiction, this work has a female central character. Background On a visit to Nantucket in July 1852 John H. Clifford, a New Bedford lawyer, state attorney general, and friend of Melville's father-in-law Lemuel Shaw, told Melville the story of Agatha Hatch Robertson, a Nantucket woman who had cared for a shipwrecked sailor named Robertson. After their marriage, Robertson abandoned her and their daughter, only to return seventeen years later, then to abandon them once again and be exposed as a bigamist. In a letter to his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne Melville described \\"the great patience and, & endurance, & resignedness of the women of the island in submitting so uncomplainingly to the long, long absences of their sailor husbands,\\" and urged Hawthorne to adopt this \\"little idea.\\" Hawthorne did not take up the idea, however. Melville worked on the manuscript in the summer and winter of 1852. . When Melville took a manuscript to his New York publishers, Harper & Brothers, in June 1853, they rejected the work. The publisher was possibly concerned about poor reviews of Pierre, or feared legal action from Agatha Hatch's family. Subsequent scholarship Although Melville's first biographers did not know of its existence, as early as 1922 the writer Meade Minnigerode found a cache of Melville family letters in the New York Public Library which included several references in 1853 to a major work which was not subsequently published. Harrison Hayford in 1946 suggested that the confirmation in a newly found letter that Melville had completed a major project after the failure of Moby-Dick exposed \\"serious errors in the theory now generally held\\", that Melville \\"in despair and defiance at the reception of Moby-Dick had written Pierre with \\"no expectation that it would succeed with the public\\", and expected that it would be his last book. Merton M. Sealts, Jr., in state of the field note of 1980, endorsed the possibility that Melville wrote the story in the winter of 1853 with Hawthorne's style in mind and that the work was a transition toward the \\"Hawthornesqe symbolism\\" of Melville's later stories. Sealts quotes Melville‚Äôs letter to Harper's Magazine of November 24, 1853, referring to \\"the work which I took to New York last Spring, but which I was prevented from printing at that time...\\" Parker in 1990 suggested that the \\"Agatha story\\" was the \\"Isle of the Cross\\" and devoted extensive space to it in the second volume of his Melville biography. In 1991, Basem L. Ra'ad concluded that \\"The Isle of the Cross\\" refers to a story, not a full-length book, and that the story was incorporated into \\"Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles\\", a series of sketches published in The Piazza Tales. Some reviewers of his Herman Melville: A Biography (2002) still objected to Parker's identification of the lost manuscript with \\"Isle of the Cross\\". Richard H. Brodhead, then of Yale University, writing in the New York Times of June 23, 2002, labelled Parker's \\"surmise\\" as \\"dubious,\\" and Andrew Delbanco of Columbia University, wrote in The New Republic, that Parker \\"trusts his own intuition\\" and presents \\"inferences as facts,\\" for \\"such a book was never published ‚Äì and it is a surmise that Melville ever wrote it.\\" Parker replied that the \\"surmise\\" was based on a line of Melville scholarship going back to the 1920s which Broadhead did not appear to be familiar with, and that Delbanco's \\"ignorance of three quarters of a century of scholarship\\" was \\"baffling.\\" In 2012 Parker noted that in Delbanco's own 2006 biography of Melville, he \\"had somehow learned about the existence\\" of \\"The Isle of the Cross,\\" which he had \\"assured the readers of The New Republic I had merely 'surmised.'\\" Cultural references In the novel The Secret of Lost Things by Sheridan Hay, one of the characters, Walter Geist, is secretly purchasing the original manuscript of \\"Isle of the Cross\\".

Toronto Sun, 19 September 2016. Milewski has reported in television, radio, and print media, from many places around the world. Assignments have included Ottawa, Calgary, Jerusalem, Europe, the Middle East, South America and the United States. He emigrated to Canada from the United Kingdom. Early life Milewski's parents immigrated to the United Kingdom before he was born. His father was a Polish medical student who fled Warsaw to serve with the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa. He completed his training in Edinburgh, where he met Milewski's mother, who was the daughter of an Egyptian doctor and a Scottish mother. She grew up in an upper-class family in Alexandria and attended boarding school in Scotland as a child. She was disowned for marrying a non-Muslim. Milewski was educated at Shrewsbury School, where he won the school's upriver swim. He dropped out of the University of Oxford after a six-month illness and later left Keele University after he was caught sunbathing in the nude. Career After leaving university, Milewski became a lifeguard and a disc jockey, and played in a blues band. He moved to Canada, where he worked first in a sawmill and then at radio stations in Williams Lake and Nanaimo, British Columbia. He joined the CBC as a local reporter in Calgary in 1978, before moving to the national news division as a science reporter in 1980, and as a parliamentary correspondent beginning in 1983. =1998 Asian Pacific Economic Conference protest coverage= In 1998, the office of Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien complained that Milewski had been \\"biassed (sic)\\" in his coverage of protests at the 1997 Asian Pacific Economic Conference (APEC) summit in Vancouver, and Milewski was suspended for three days from the CBC. Milewski's investigations of Chretien's possible connections to the RCMP attack on peaceful protesters at the summit were persistent, and the controversy eventually compelled Solicitor General Andy Scott to resign his cabinet post. The alleged bias was found in some remarks in e-mails between Milewski and arrested protester Craig Jones, as well as in providing coverage of protesters' points of view. The CBC reported that its Ombudsman, Marcel Pepin, over a five-month period, reviewed all of Milewski's TV reporting and communications with sources concerning APEC. He concluded that Milewski's reports \\"cannot be faulted from the point of view of accuracy and fairness.\\" Pepin found that \\"...concerns that Milewski was one-sided were not justified.\\" At the time of the finding, the CBC also reported that Milewski was serving an 18-day suspension, but that \\"...Milewski was not suspended because of his journalism but for other undisclosed reasons.\\" It emerged that these \\"other\\" reasons were Milewski's public insistence that his conduct and his reporting were sound. Pepin further credited Milewski with \\"aggressive and critical journalism\\" which was valuable both to the journalism community and to the public at large. =2006 Sikh documentary= In 2006, Milewski reported in a documentary for the CBC that a minority within Canada's Sikh community was gaining political influence even while publicly supporting terrorist acts in support of the struggle for an independent Sikh state. The World Sikh Organization (WSO) sued the CBC for \\"defamation, slander and libel\\", alleging that Milewski linked it to terrorism and damaged the reputation of the WSO within the Sikh community.Sikh Organisation Sues Canadian Broadcaster(Canada) The documentary remains unaltered on the CBC website and, in 2015, the WSO unconditionally abandoned \\"any and all claims\\" made in its lawsuit. =2011 Canadian federal election= After the motion of non-confidence had passed by the House of Commons, at the press conference Milewski accused Michael Ignatieff of not being forthcoming about forming a coalition with the other opposition parties should the ruling Conservatives not win a majority, saying \\"Surely this coalition monkey is going to stay on your back every day of the campaign? Because people will assume that if you don't rule it out, that's because you‚Äôve got something to hide.\\" Ignatieff maintained \\"if you want to replace the Harper government, you‚Äôve got to vote Liberal. It can't be clearer than that\\". =2014 Opposition to reporting on global surveillance revelations= In a speech by Glenn Greenwald in Ottawa on 25 October 2014, which was broadcast by C-SPAN, Greenwald and journalist Jesse Brown alleged that Terry Milewski, as a CBC News senior correspondent was responsible for a major CBC resistance into reporting the facts about global surveillance, object of the documents provided by Edward Snowden. Brown claimed that Milewski was ideologically opposed to reporting those facts, regardless the fact that they were being reported widely by all major newspapers all over the world.C-SPAN.org: Glenn Greenwald Privacy Government Surveillance  Video  C-SPAN.org, accessdate: 5 May 2015 In response, Milewski challenged Brown and Greenwald to square their allegations with his actual published critiques of government policy on mass surveillance. One called those plans \\"Orwellian.\\" Another criticised the lack of parliamentary oversight of Canada's spy agency. A third contradicted then- Prime Minister Stephen Harper's claim that Canada did not use metadata as a surveillance tool. Brown and Greenwald did not respond to Milewski's challenge. Personal life Milewski is married with two children.

Five of her seven brothers died in the year 1854, and she traveled to America in 1856 to claim an inheritance from one of their estates; she worked as a tablemaid for a wealthy American family during her stay. Watt married James Sim (1831‚Äì1877), a fisherman, on 2 December 1858 in Broadsea. They had ten children.  Institutionalisation  In 1877, Watt's son, Peter, was drowned at sea, an event to which Watt attributed her being admitted to an asylum. According to the case notes of the Aberdeen Royal Asylum at Cornhill, Watt was first admitted on 15 November 1877 with the diagnosis of \\"mania\\". According to both case notes and Watt's memoirs, Watt's mental health crises were characterised by religious delusions and a preoccupation with religious matters. On 29 December 1877 she was discharged as \\"recovered\\". However, on 29 January 1879 she was readmitted, again with a diagnosis of \\"mania\\". On 25 June 1879 she was discharged \\"recovered\\", but was readmitted a final time on 17 September 1879. During her time spent in the asylum, Watt became known as one of the \\"characters\\" of the institution. She remained there until she died in 1923 at the age of ninety.  Memoirs  She was a well-educated woman and wrote her memoirs. She was encouraged by two fellow patients, a doctor and a solicitor, at the Royal Aberdeen Asylum. These memoirs tell the story of her own life and the history of her family, which included members of the local minor nobility. They give an insight into the lives of fishing families in the latter half of the 19th century. Her account was written in pencil, in a clear hand. According to her memoirs, patients were not allowed quill pens, for fear they would use them as a weapon or drink the ink. Her writings were published posthumously as The Christian Watt Papers, edited by her descendant David Fraser, in 1983. An alternative edition was released in 1994, from the original manuscript owned by her granddaughter, Christian Sims. Some scholars have expressed doubt over the authenticity of the published Watt papers, positing that they might have been written by one of her descendants. However, if Watt did not write the memoir herself, it is agreed that what was written was informed by her reminiscences.  Adaptations  Her memoirs have since been the subject of a radio drama, Light in a Dark Place (1984), a stage play, Precarious Living (1985), and a drama documentary series, Caorstaidh (Kirsty) (1994). There is a Christian Watt Drive in Fraserburgh. References Further reading *Watt, Christian The Christian Watt Papers; edited and with an introduction by David Fraser.

The station, established in 1974 by Saint Michael's College as the original FM home of its campus radio station WWPV-FM, currently airs a classical format from the VPR Classical network. History =WWPV-FM= WWPV's roots lie in a carrier current AM station with the call letters WSSE, created in the 1950s. This station was initially run by the Edmundite priests that founded Saint Michael's, before becoming more of a student station in later years. In 1973, the college obtained a license to operate on 88.7 FM and put it on the air as WWPV-FM, replacing WSSE. A new station was built in an old military barracks on the college's North Campus, located at Fort Ethan Allen. In 1988, the station moved to the St. Michael's main campus with a new studio space in the newly constructed St. Edmund's Hall. As WWPV-FM, 88.7 FM operated as a campus radio station under the nickname The Mike. The station allowed any student, faculty, or staff member of SMC to be a DJ, as well as members of the local community. Throughout its existence, WWPV's programming has been freeform in nature, playing music that can't be heard on any commercial or mainstream radio stations in the Burlington area, including indie, jazz, blues, and folk. Each show has its own specialty, so a jazz show might be followed by an indie show, which then might be followed by a punk rock show. Throughout the 1970s, 80s, and most of the 90s, the station aired live shows throughout the day, but had dead air during overnight hours or during other times when no live DJs were in the studio. This changed in 1999, when WWPV entered a partnership with Vermont Public Radio, in which VPR broadcast its BBC World Service feed at 88.7 FM when there were no live shows being aired. In May 2009, VPR and WWPV mutually agreed to terminate this relationship. WWPV now airs music programming 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with an automated mix of music from the station's music library when there are no DJs in the studio. VPR later shifted its BBC World Service programming to a dedicated HD Radio channel. WWPV put on free concerts every spring at St. Michael's, a tradition that started in 2007 with a free Zox show. In spring 2008, the station won a nationwide college/university contest through the independent digital music retailer Mytracks.com, winning $5,000 to put towards a concert. The station beat out radio stations and programming boards at prestigious large universities such as Ole Miss, Michigan State, and Kentucky. With its winnings, WWPV brought State Radio to the college to perform a concert at the St. Michael's gymnasium that April. The WWPV concert took a hiatus in 2009, although the station organized a smaller concert featuring Grimis right before Christmas. Station staff has announced that the concert will be back in 2010, and this time will take place outdoors. =Spring 2007 VPR buyout controversy= In March 2007, WWPV attracted local attention when Vermont Public Radio approached the college's president, Marc vanderHeyden, and the Board of Trustees with an interest in purchasing the frequency to turn it into a 24-hour classical station. After word of this potential sale became public in the Burlington Free Press and the St. Michael's online magazine, The Echo, SMC students, faculty, and staff rallied against the sale in an effort to preserve the station as a student-run, freeform college station. Numerous letters were written to the Free Press, posters were put up around campus, and a large Facebook group was created to mobilize students. Because of the outcry, vanderHeyden recommended to the board that the station not be sold, effectively ending the possibility of a deal. Vermont Public Radio instead bought 90.9 FM, now known as WOXR, to run the classical format. =Donation to Vermont Public Radio= On February 12, 2014, Saint Michael's College was granted a construction permit for a low-power FM station on 92.5 FM in Colchester. Under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, the college was required to divest the 88.7 FM facility upon constructing the new station; on April 8, 2015, it agreed to donate the WWPV-FM license to Vermont Public Radio. On September 14, 2015, WWPV's programming moved to the new WWPV- LP; the following day, WWPV-FM went silent. VPR officially took control of 88.7 FM on September 17, 2015 and changed the station's call sign to WVTX; it intends to move the station's transmitter from the Saint Michael's campus to an as-yet-undetermined location, and will keep WVTX silent until this move is completed. As of June 2018, WVTX was airing VPR Classical programming. References *Cain, Jacqueline. \\"St. Michael's radio station to go automated\\", \\"The Echo\\", April 28, 2009. Accessed August 15, 2009.

He is unable to bring himself to slaughter a cow as part of the funeral ritual. Vusi's younger brother Ernest, a former soldier, constantly berates him for his choice to run away to U.S. instead of taking part in \\"the struggle\\". This angers Vusi, who tells Ernest: \\"I was in the struggle while you were still pissing in your pants.\\" While talking with his mother, Vusi wonders why his youngest brother Steven was not at the funeral. His mother admits that they have not seen Steven in a while. She provides Vusi with two addresses and sends him out to find Steven. The first address Vusi checks is Steven's apartment in Johannesburg, where he meets his brother's neighbor Karen (Elizabeth Hurley). He gives her his contact information, in case she hears anything. After checking the second address, Vusi starts driving out of Soweto. He is confronted by three armed thugs who take his car, jacket, and shirt. The thugs also break his father's spear, a family heirloom. Vusi returns to his hotel and calls his fianc√©e to tell her what has happened to him. He receives a note from Karen telling him to meet her at The Summit Club. At the club, Vusi discovers Karen's occupation as a stripper. She reports hearing noises, coming from Steven's apartment. After the show, the pair returns to the apartment complex and decides to check the room. Karen climbs along the outside of the building to Steven's open window, where a thug attacks her. The thug flees, knocking over Vusi in his escape. The encounter causes Vusi to wonder what is actually going on with Steven. Karen finally confesses that Steven had borrowed cocaine on \\"credit\\" from a drug dealer named Muki (Ving Rhames). Steven was initially planning to sell the drug and make enough money for Karen and him to travel to the United States and visit Vusi. Steven instead took the money and drugs for himself. With the truth revealed, Karen suggests they check out the local clubs to see if they can find any leads. At a hard-rock club Vusi finds out about Karen's crack cocaine addiction, after watching her take a hit from a pipe. He confronts her about it, and suspects she was the one who got Steven hooked on the drug. The duo are accosted by white supremacist punks outside the club. Two of thugs pin Vusi to a wall at gunpoint, while the leader of the gang hits Karen for associating with a \\"kaffir\\". Vusi manages to get the upper hand on the punks, while Karen grabs the gun and hands it over to Vusi. Vusi holds the leader of the punks at gunpoint, before knocking him out and pistol-whipping the other punk. Back at the apartment, Karen asks Vusi to visit her drug dealer and purchase a gram of crack for her. Or else, she will not tell him anything else about Steven. Vusi reluctantly accepts her terms . Karen's drug dealer, Sam, is initially suspicious of Vusi. He becomes relaxed when Vusi reveals that he knows Karen. Sam tells Vusi that Muki will not allow him to sell to Karen. Muki reportedly suspects that Karen and Steven may be working together to hide the money. Sam charges an extra 50 dollars and tells Vusi to stay in the apartment. Vusi answers the door to find Steven, who flees from him down an alley. Vusi returns to the apartment, where he is confronted by a switchblade- wielding Sam. Sam demands to know why he left. Vusi pulls a gun and forces Sam over to the window, interrogating him on the whereabouts of Muki. Sam replies \\"you don't find Muki, Muki finds you.\\" Sam returns the money to Vusi, along with the drugs Karen asked for. Vusi heads back to Karen's place. Karen learns that Vusi revealed his status as Steven's brother to Sam. She figures that Muki will find out about the connection and becomes paranoid. They leave her apartment and head towards Vusi's hotel room. The next morning, Vusi drops Karen back at her apartment. He is then confronted by one of Muki's men in his car. The car is stopped by more of Muki's men, and Vusi is captured. He is placed in the trunk of a car. Vuki is transported to a soccer stadium, where Muki is waiting to meet him. Muki tells Vusi about his brother's massive debt of 45,000 rand. He threatens to have the entire Madlazi family killed to settle the debt. But he will agree to spare Steven's life and leave them alone, if Vusi is able to bring him 15,000 U.S. dollars in two days. Karen tells Vusi that Steven headed for Sun City, in order to gamble back the money he needs to pay back the debt. The duo head out for the casino. They drive through an Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement rally and then arrive at the casino. Karen and Vusi split up to search the casino. While playing on a slot machine, Karen is approached by Steven who immediately asks her for some cocaine. Karen informs him that his father has died, information which saddens Steven. Steven tells her that he only managed to make back 2,000 of the 45,000 rand which he owes to Muki, but that he still has 5 grams of Muki's product stashed away. Karen heads up to Steven's room with him. Steven shoots up over half a gram of crack into his arm. An arriving Vusi locates Steven and becomes angry at Karen, for allowing his brother to become an addict. He calms down and the trio leaves the casino. Vusi is only able to get 14,100 dollars to pay back Muki. The trio heads off to the hotel to pay off the debt anyway. Steven yells at Muki for trashing his apartment, but is told to shut up by Vusi. Muki is pleased with the money Vusi was able to bring him. Vusi promises to pay him the rest of the money by the next day. Muki tells Steven that the word is out that people can mess with Muki, and that he must send a message despite their deal. Muki then shoots Steven with Vusi's gun, which had been confiscated on the way in. A man in the apartment, who is revealed to be a detective sergeant, is disgusted at Muki's actions. While Steven's body is moved out, Muki takes a large hit from a bong. He had offered the bong to Steven before shooting him. Steven's corpse is brought back to the village for burial. There, Vusi recruits Ernest to help him take revenge on Muki. While in the village, Vusi's spear is repaired. Vusi is finally able to slaughter a goat, as part of Steven's funeral. Ernest leads Vusi and Karen to a weapons' cache he had buried. With the weapons needed to take their revenge, the trio goes back to Sam's apartment. Under threat of torture, they convince Sam to help them by carrying in a bomb that Ernest had put in a present box. At Muki's place, Sam attempts to warn Muki's men of the bomb in the box.

As such, to buy favour with the family, Alexander Fraser, 11th Lord Saltoun, created a title for the head of the Nobles - the 'Constable of Broadsea'. The Constableship passed from the Nobles to the Lascelles family in a series of marriages until the 1740s, when the title was revoked by the Hanoverian state. William Lascelles, the last Constable, had been against both the Act of Union and Hanoverian succession. The title continued for at least two more generations as a hereditary pretendership. It has been claimed that later Noble families descend from both the 11th and 12th Lord Saltouns of Abernethy. Constables of Broadsea 3rd Constable - Alexander Noble, Traveller of Zetland. 4th Constable - Grissel Noble, daughter of Alexander. 5th Constable - David Lascelles, son of Grissel and Walter Lascelles. 6th Constable - Anne Lascelles, sister of David. 7th Constable - Margaret Ann Noble, daughter of Anne and Patrick Noble. 8th Constable - William Lascelles (c.1737-1785), son of Margaret and James Lascelles 9th Constable - Helen Lascelles (c.1758-1841), Pretender. 10th Constable - Helen Noble, Pretender. The 10th Constable was the mother of Christian Watt. This projection is based on Granny Lascelles account.

Creation Autosportif, Ltd. is a sports car racing team based in Oxford, England. It was founded in 2003 by Ian Bickerton and Mike Jankowski and has raced in the FIA GT Championship, FFSA GT Championship, American Le Mans Series, Le Mans Endurance Series, as well as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Their cars are known for their blue and yellow paint schemes. Naming Creation Autosportif gets its name from the Pillars of Creation, a formation in the Eagle Nebula. Company founder Mike Jankowski, as an astronomy fan and not wanting to create a team name composed of an acronym, selected the name Creation and based the team's logo around the idea of pillars emanating from a central star. Racing history In 2003, Creation Autosportif purchased a Lister Storm from the Lister factory for use in the FIA GT Championship, with backing from Stuff magazine as a major sponsor. By the seventh round at Anderstorp, the team purchased a second Storm for use in the championship. The team took their best result at Motorsport Arena Oschersleben, with a second-place finish behind a JMB Racing Ferrari. Scoring points in all but one round, Creation was able to take fourth place in the teams championship. Creation continued in FIA GT in 2004, but decided to switch back to a one car team. They achieved a best finish of fourth at Hockenheimring before the team dropped out of FIA GT after the round at Imola, due to various problems with their Lister Storms. Creation Autosportif's newer CA06/H at the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans. Creation instead chose to concentrate on their new endeavour, a Le Mans prototype the team had purchased from RN Motorsport known as a DBA 03S, which was in fact a modified Reynard 02S. The team would use their 03S in the newly founded Le Mans Endurance Series, managing to take two third-place finishes in the four race season, earning them fourth place in the teams championship. The team also flew to the United States to participate in the final two rounds of the American Le Mans Series season, including the Petit Le Mans. Unfortunately the car failed to finish either time, but was notable for claiming pole position at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca ahead of the dominant Audi R8s. Creation continued with their DBA 03S in the Le Mans Endurance Series in 2005, improving with a best finish of second at the home race at Silverstone Circuit. The team eventually finished 5th in the teams championship. The team also received their first ever invitation to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, successfully bringing their 03S home 14th overall. For 2006, Creation's 03S was no longer legal and had to be modified in order to meet Le Mans Prototype regulations. With the assistance of engineering firm KWM, the DBA 03S was upgraded and rehomologated as the Creation CA06/H. The team also switched from their older Zytek engines to newer and larger Judds. With this new car, the team continued in the Le Mans Endurance Series (now renamed the Le Mans Series), taking another best finish of second at the N√ºrburgring. A second CA06/H was added to the team at Donington Park, where the team managed to take both second and third. At the end of the season, the team finished second in the teams championship, earning themselves an automatic invitation to the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans. Elsewhere in 2006, Creation returned again to Le Mans to attempt to finish the classic endurance race. Unfortunately the car failed to finish. The team also returned to the American Le Mans Series, finishing fourth at the Petit Le Mans after taking pole and then finishing third at Laguna Seca. Plans Creation's CA07, now carrying an AIM V10 engine, competing in the 2008 Le Mans Series season In 2007, in order to meet new Le Mans prototype regulations, Creation will construct an all new chassis, known as the CA07, with plans for a two car team and possibly even customer chassis to be sold in the future. The team will again concentrate on the Le Mans Series and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with possibly participation in American Le Mans Series events. The team has also made an agreement with Japanese firm AIM to use their new V10 motors in 2008, replacing their aged Judds. The CA07 chassis may also be modified by the team into a closed-cockpit car, in anticipation of future Le Mans Prototype regulations. Creation also managed to sell their two CA06/H chassis to Intersport Racing and Autocon Motorsports for use in the American Le Mans Series, where the older chassis is still legal. The two teams received assistance from Creation in racing their purchases.

They were notable for their involvement in Ruskinian gothic architecture in the mid-19th century. Practice The practice comprised the brothers James and John O'Shea, along with their nephew Edward Whelan. James and John were the sons of a craftsman who came to Cork to work on the construction of Convamore House, and who remained and set up a workshop in nearby Ballyhooly village.A chronological history of art and architecture in nineteenth century Cork After his death the workshop was inherited by James and John, and is often referred to as \\"The O'Shea Brothers\\". However Whelan's role in the firm was equally significant. Nevertheless, James O'Shea was the most notable of the family. In addition to his work as an architectural mason he exhibited fine art sculptures in the classical style.The architecture of the Museum The billiard-playing monkeys in the Kildare Street Club, Dublin The O'Sheas initially achieved notability for their floral carvings and grotesqueries on buildings in Dublin, in particular at Trinity College and at the Kildare Street Club, including the famous window piece showing the club members as monkeys playing billiards. Work with Ruskin At the time John Ruskin was seeking to revive lively freehand stone carving of the kind typical of medieval Gothic architecture. The architects Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward were proposing to work with Ruskin on the design of the new Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Woodward, who had worked with them in Dublin, brought in the O'Sheas as the best qualified carvers for the job. The O'Sheas worked in tandem with Ruskin and the architects to produce a series of elaborate carvings of plant and animal forms. Each was a unique and individual design. Celtic Cross in memory of Talbot Baines Reed James O'Shea also attempted to establish himself as a fine artist with Ruskin's help, though Ruskin eventually declared himself \\"disappointed\\" with the carver's work. Ruskin later claimed that \\"the delight in the freedom and power which would have been the elements of all health to a trained workman were destruction to him...I hoped he would find his way in time, but hoped, as so often, in vain.\\"Ruskin, John, Complete Works, Library Edition, London, George len, 1903-12, vol.39, p.525 Further problems arose when the Convocation of the university refused to pay for more carvings, which had largely been funded by public subscriptions. When the O'Sheas offered to work without pay, some members of Convocation accused them of \\"defacing\\" the building with unauthorised work. According to Henry Acland, the professor who liaised with Ruskin, James O'Shea proceeded to carve caricatures of members of Convocation on the entrance of the building in the form of parrots and owls. Acland forced him to remove the heads, which remain defaced to this day.Geoffrey Tyack, Oxford: An Architectural Guide, p. 219 Other projects The O'Sheas also worked on several other projects. One of the O'Sheas carved statues for St Mary's church in Rhyl, Wales. One also worked for the architect J.F. Bentley, who described his attitude as \\"unbearable\\".Frederick O'Dwyer, The Architecture of Deane and Woodward, p.405 Thomas Deane later employed Whelan to work in Oxford on the Meadow Building and at the Fleet Street Crown Life Office. Thomas Woolner, a sculptor also involved in the Oxford project, employed James O'Shea to create carvings for his home. The O'Sheas and Whelan went on to work with Woolner and the architect Alfred Waterhouse in the design of the Manchester assize courts, producing a series of capitals depicting gruesome forms of punishment in history. Though the original building was demolished following bomb damage in World War Two, the carvings survive in the replacement building. James O'Shea returned to Ireland to work in Callan as a monumental sculptor, specialising in Celtic crosses and establishing a new firm with his son Edward. A fine example of this work is the Celtic cross in memory of the children's author Talbot Baines Reed, which stands at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington, London.

It was first released on two disk cards for the Family Computer Disk System. The first disk was released on September 4, 1987, while the second disk was released September 30, 1987. The driving force behind the series, Tatsuya Hishida of Nintendo EAD, was responsible for directing the game, creating the characters, and crafting the storyline. Gameplay Donbe (left) and Hikari (right) in Shin Onigashima The game is played by selecting commands which make the characters talk to, use, or examine various objects or characters. Progress is marked by changes in the illustrative image in the top-right corner of the screen. One of the most distinctive features of the game is the \\"Change Character\\" command, used to switch between the two main characters (Donbe, the boy, and Hikari, the girl). The characters can move through the story separately at times, and may be called upon to do tasks that the other main character cannot accomplish on their own. The use of this command in certain situations can trigger dialogue particular to each character, bringing out the peculiarities of each. This is essentially a form of zapping, but a similar command was implemented in the 1995 visual novel EVE Burst Error. The game also utilizes the Disk System's feature of being able to exchange game discs while the device is powered on. The game is divided into two discs, and the player must exchange disks while the Disk System is still powered on in order to activate the second disc (note: Disc 2 is not playable without the first). This format was also used in the game's sequel Y≈´y≈´ki and the Famicom Tantei Club series. Plot Once upon a time, there was an elderly couple living in Nagakushi village, a small village located far up in the mountains. The couple had no children, until one day, they were entrusted with the care of an infant boy and girl, as prophesied in a dream. The years went by, and when the two children were 8 years old, there was a terrible occurrence in the western capital. An evil dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into oni, ogres that suck away the souls of other humans. The oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple. Fortunately the two children were left unharmed, and they set out on a quest to save their adopted parents, not realizing that this adventure would reveal the secret of their true origins... Characters The two protagonists are listed with their default names. ;Donbe :A small boy resembling a caveman with long blue hair that obstructs his eyes, and a teal robe. He was born from a rice bowl floating down the river. Not the most intelligent of children, but wields massive strength for his age. On the second disc, he undergoes an age change, looking more like a young teenager. ;Hikari :A little girl born from a glittering bamboo tree. Smart and resourceful, but physically weak. Acts as Donbe's older sister. ;Elderly couple :The old man and old woman who raised Donbe and Hikari. Their souls were later stolen by the evil Oni. ;Ringo :A dog that was waiting for Donbe at the foot of the bridge. Loyal and obedient. ;Matsunosuke :A monkey that joins the group at Kikaigamori Forest. Boisterous and sometimes disobedient. ;Ohana :A pheasant bird that joins the group at Shiraishi Spring. As the final member of the group, it uses its abilities to ferry the group over to Onigashima. ;Ittaisan :The narrator of the game. Appears as a merchant from a neighboring town within the storyline. ;Kintaro :A mysterious English-speaking boy wearing sunglasses and a red haramaki. Guides the group along their adventure. ;Tengu :An odd-ball tengu who was hiding out in the oni fortress. He takes a liking to the two protagonists, and follows along with the group to Onigashima. ;Hinoesama :A god-like being who appears before the protagonists as a star. Hinoesama reveals the evil forces behind the terrible events occurring throughout the world, and entrusts the protagonists with the task of restoring order. ;Oni :Evil monsters that steal the souls of humans to give to the dragon. They are actually humans whose souls have been stolen by other oni. ;Ankoku no Keshin (The Avatar of Darkness) :An evil creature from the world of darkness. Appears in the form of a dragon to eat the souls of humans. ;Otohime :The legendary hero that sealed the Avatar of Darkness into a treasure box ages ago. She is also the princess of the Ryukyujin; a tribe living deep beneath the seas. Development As indicated by the game's subtitle, the game borrows heavily from traditional Japanese fairytales such as Momotar≈ç and Princess Kaguya. Most text-based adventure games of the time were written in the style of mystery novels, where the player had to solve a murder or crime of some sort, but Shin Onigashima's fairytale-like plot gave a much softer and accessible feel to the genre. A conversion of the game was included as part of Heisei Shin Onigashima, released for the Super Famicom in 1997 and 1998. It was also redone for the Game Boy Advance as part of the Famicom Mini series on August 4, 2004. The Virtual Console release came on June 19, 2007. The game was never released outside Japan. Reception The game's difficulty is rather high, as very few hints are given in solving mysteries, and many circumstances can lead to the \\"game over\\" screen. Even so, the game's warm graphics and plot consisting of numerous interwoven Japanese fairytales was positively received by fans and critics alike. The in-game music, written by Koji Kondo, is regarded in equally high esteem, and the game is considered an undeniable success as Nintendo's first text-based adventure game. The 1989 \\"All Soft Catalog\\" issue of Famicom Ts≈´shin (now Famitsu) included Shin Onigashima in its list of the best games of all time. In particular, they gave it the award for the best \\"Adventure\\" game of all time. In 2013, IGN noted similarities to later adventure games such as Famicom Tantei Club, Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School, 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, and Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward.http://ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/the-secret-library-of-the- famicom Super Famicom release Nine years after the release of the Disk System version, was released on September 29, 1996, for the Super Famicom's Satellaview unit. The game was broadcast via the St.GIGA BS Satellite, and was downloadable within the BS-X menu from the . BS Shin Onigashima takes its plot from the original version of the game, but is mostly presented from the viewpoint of the three helpers who join the protagonists during the game (the dog, monkey and pheasant). In-game music was transmitted via radio, and Ittaisan, the game's narrator, appears in-between chapters to sum up the storyline via SoundLink. The character of Ittaisan was voiced by Ichir≈ç Nagai. The Satellaview version was well received by fans. The Super Famicom version uses the same command menu gameplay implemented in the Disk System version, but the \\"Change Character\\" command was not included due to time constraints. Satellaview games were only broadcast during a limited time period, and using the command would complicate the game to an unnecessary degree. New tweaks by the developers were to include platform-style action scenes, and to set time limits for choosing certain commands. On December 1, 1997, BS Shin Onigashima was redone for a commercial release on the Nintendo Power, as with the original Disk System game included as a bonus. Its popularity prompted a cartridge release on May 23, 1998. This version was also released in two cartridges, but unlike the Disk System release, it is possible to play the second cartridge without having finished the first one. =Changes= The Satellaview broadcast was divided into four chapters, and in the Super Famicom release, the first two chapters make up the first disk, and the latter two make up the second. \\"Jizo Ittaisan\\" are placed throughout the game, which allow the player to save. There are no time limits for choosing commands, and a golden buddha statue in the likeness of Mario appears in the first chapter. The original Disk System version is unlocked after all four chapters are completed. This was not a complete port of the original, as several changes were made to the text and in-game music. An opening demo of Donbe and Kintaro in a sumo match is added, and colors appear darker than the original. Game Boy Advance version Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima was released for the Game Boy Advance on August 10, 2004 as part of the Famicom Mini: Disk System selection series. Unlike the previous installations, the GBA version does not require changing between disks; the entire game is played on one cartridge. The game itself saw no major changes, but on-screen menus were fixed to accommodate the GBA. Load and save times were eliminated by the use of the faster cartridge, allowing the game to run without breaks.

A man of outstanding knowledge and talent, he was an exemplar of old-world Lithuanian Torah scholarship and sagacity. Born in Kovno, Lithuania, Rabbi Ferber studied in the prestigious Slabodka yeshiva, as well as under such Talmudic and Mussar giants as Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, Rabbi Yitzchak Blazer and Rabbi Naftali Amsterdam. He came to Manchester, England in 1911, where he founded a yeshiva along with Rabbi Yehoshua Dov Silverstone. Biography Tzvi Hirsch was born to his parents Shimon Yehuda Leib (died March 9, 1906) and Chana Devorah (died December 29, 1911) Farber (note the spelling) in Slabodka/Kovno in about 1878.All Lithuania Revision List Database: \\"1898 Revision List of Vilijampole\\", Page: 329, Registration #: 956, Former Registration #: 240, Head of Household: Leyb son of Girsh FARBER, age 73, Wife: Sora Chana age 73, Son: Chaim, Son: Leyzer, son: Mordkhel age 31 (listed with wife and children), son: David age 23, Son Girsh FARBER age 20 (this is Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Ferber - the Russian language does not have an H), daughter: Rivka age 26.

Most of his siblings are mentioned in Kerem Hatzvi as well He married Fraida the daughter of Tzvi Yosef Goldberg (died June 6, 1923), great granddaughter of Rabbi Zev Wolf Lipkin, the Av Beth Din of Goldingen and Telz (the Ben Aryeh, author of glosses on the Talmud & Rishonim; died May 18, 1858) and great niece of Rav Yisrael Salanter Lipkin (died Feb 2, 1883; Father of the Musar Movement). The name Tzvi Hirsch is a bilingual tautological name in Yiddish.Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew. Palgrave Macmillan. / It means literally \\"deer-deer\\" and is traceable back to the Hebrew word ◊¶◊ë◊ô tsvi \\"deer\\" and the German word Hirsch \\"deer\\".. London In July 1913, he accepted a call to become Rabbi of the West End Talmud Torah Synagogue in Soho, London, a disorganised community of working-class Jewish immigrants of Eastern European origin. In a short span of time, Rabbi Ferber successfully centralised the unorganised Jewish activities and religious life of the community into one institution. Active in communal affairs, Rabbi Ferber established the Chesed V‚Äôemeth Burial Society in 1915. He helped found the London yeshiva and was for many years the honorary secretary of the London \\"Vaad Harabonim\\" (rabbinical council) and chairman of the Association of London Rabbis (\\"Hisachdus Harabonim\\"). A member of its World Rabbinical council, Rabbi Ferber gave valuable assistance to the Agudas Yisroel movement. He closely collaborated with Rabbi Dr M Jung and Rabbi Dr V Schonfeld in Shechita and other communal issues. He was a friend of Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook, Chief Rabbi of Palestine, from the time that the latter was Rabbi of Machzike Hadath in London. Rabbi Ferber was hugely admired and venerated by his congregants and colleagues worldwide. Indeed, when he left his seat, everyone stood up and bowed towards him as a sign of respect. He was described as a ‚Äúman of saintliness and gentleness, loved and admired by all who came into contact with him‚Äù. One of the most riveting Jewish orators of his day, he preached his sermons in Yiddish, and could bring his congregation to tears of nostalgia, or ‚Äúget everyone laughing within the space of two sentences\\". Rabbi Ferber was rabbi of Soho for 42 years, from 1913 until his retirement in 1955. He died in 1966 in London, survived by his son Rabbi Jacob Ferber and four older daughters. The eldest daughter Hoda Malka (Eda) married the teacher, editor and poet Chaim Lewis. Eda was an early female marriage counsellor in post war London. Chaim Lewis published the prize winning memoir 'A Soho Address' (Gollancz, 1965) and several books of poetry and was editor of The Jewish Review periodical in South Africa. The second daughter Feiga Leah (Fanny) was married to Rabbi Moshe (Morris) Davidson, Rabbi of the South West London United synagogue, who obtained his smicha from Rav Elya Lopian at Etz Chaim yeshiva, London. The third daughter Anne took care of her father in his later years. The fourth daughter Liba (Lilly) married Rabbi Shlomo Pesach Toperoff, who first served as rabbi of Sunderland and then as Rabbi of Newcastle upon Tyne. He authored of many prolific works including Lev Avot, Echod Mi Yodea, Eternal Life a handbook for the mourner, and The Animal Kingdom in Jewish Thought. Scholarship In the world of Torah, Rabbi Ferber was renowned as an outstanding scholar and sage. A prolific author, he produced 22 acclaimed works of Torah scholarship, perhaps the largest ever output by a Rabbi in England. He was also a frequent contributor to numerous Hebrew journals and an avid reader in the Hebrew collections of the British Library. Taking advantage of his location in the West End, he visited the Oriental Reading Room of the British Museum every day. =Works= *Kerem HaTzvi ‚Äì 5 volume work on the Torah (Beraishis, Shemos, Vayikra, Bamidbar and Devarim) and Haggada, Rabbi Ferber's seminal work, issued between 1920 and 1938 *Degel Machane Yehudah ‚Äì dealing with the influence of some archaeological finds on Torah interpretation (1925) *Shvil HaTzvi - commentary on Megillas Esther (1933) *Aishes Chayil - commentary on Aishes Chayil (1934) *Birur Halacha - on civil marriages and divorce in Jewish law (1937) *Kiryas Chana David - about King David (1950) *Sefer Hamo'adim - volume of sermons (1950) *Hegyonei Tzvi - on the end of days in Judaism (1952) *Chamudei Tzvi - thoughts on the festivals and special periods of the year (1953) *Hegyonei Avos - commentary on Pirkei Avos (1954) *Siach Tzvi - commentary on prayer (1955) *Kerem HaTorah (1956) *Zivchei Todah - on Torah, prayer and Pirkei Avos (1957)  References  * Jewish Chronicle archival material * Short obituary in HaPardes, Rabbinic journal (page 38, Hebrew) * Rebi Eliezer Gordon, page 176 Category:1879 births Category:1966 deaths Category:20th-century rabbis Category:Bible commentators Category:British Orthodox rabbis Category:British people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:Rabbis from London Category:English Orthodox rabbis Category:Haredi rabbis in Europe Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Lithuanian Orthodox rabbis Category:Writers from Kaunas Category:Writers from London Category:Date of birth missing Category:Date of death missing ","title":"Tzvi Hirsch Ferber"},{"id":"10526536","text":"Kappatoo is a CITV show based on a book by Ben Steed, starring Simon Nash in the dual roles of time traveller from the future Kappatoo and his lookalike, 1990's schoolboy soccer player Simon Cashmere.

Headquartered in Budapest, Hungary with 121 employees (as of November 2018). The company also operates business and consultancy offices in Cambridge, MA, San Diego, CA, and in Prague. ChemAxon has distributors in China, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Australia. ChemAxon provides solutions, platforms, applications, and consultancy services for handling chemical and biological entities for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, new materials, fine-, petro- and agrochemical, food and cosmetics industries. ChemAxon supports academic institutions through special software licensing programs for students, teachers, academic researchers, and high school curriculums. Tools and software solutions are offered to academic research groups wishing to integrate cheminformatic functionalities into open website platforms via web hosting services. History ChemAxon was founded in 1998 by two brothers, Ferenc and P√©ter Csizmadia. The company name was created by combining the words chem, indicating chemistry, and axon referring to a vast network of connections between the scientific and informatic domains. Initially, ChemAxon offered consultancy services and later moved into product development. As a startup company ChemAxon had very strong ties with local universities engaging in software development projects with PhD students. Emerging technologies and software languages were studied. As a result a platform independent, back end product line, relying on Java started to come together. The first ChemAxon software product was Marvin, a chemical editor. Its first version was released in January 1999. Marvin was followed by the development of the JChem technology, adding chemical intelligence to common database management systems with the first release in early 2000; also providing the first company sale that same year. ChemAxon's first software developments were summed up in scientific articles and posters presented in cheminformatics journals and conferences. The company revenue and user number rocketed in the early 2000s calling for the first user meeting in 2005. In 2004 ChemAxon decided to support academic research and education by offering a free software license package. ChemAxon also established representatives in the US from 2000, and in Japan via an official distributor company in 2005. Growing user requests led to the development and the release of more software products. The company's product portfolio expanded with physical and chemical calculations and predictions, desktop based chemical database management applications and chemical naming intelligence. The growing trend affected employee numbers and required a larger head office space. The first official office headquarters opened in 2003 in the M√°ramaros k√∂z, Budapest, Hungary. A software development office opened in Prague, Czech Republic in 2006. ChemAxon's desktop-based, cheminformatics product portfolio maturited in late 2000s. GlaxoSmithKline contracted with them in late 2009. The company started to experiment with agile software development approach in 2010, eventually adopting scrum methodology in the following year. ChemAxon encourages an agile office environment with cross-functional teams. This philosophy is supported by a publicly available online company culture guide. With the wave of change came new product development directions that mimicked the trends in the industry towards the end of the 2000s. The demand for online services emerged in research to allow lab colleagues to access chemical applications from all devices, enabling contract research organizations and other suppliers to collaborate with chemical data, and cut IT costs at the same time. ChemAxon started to build its cloud-based software systems in 2008 - the first one being Chemicalize - and continuously expanded in this area. On the other hand, the rise of the biologics within newly developed pharmaceutical drugs influenced ChemAxon to start developing its biopolymer informatics portfolio in 2015. In 2011, ChemAxon moved its office headquarters to Graphisoft Park, one of Budapest's tech hubs, where the company is currently located. More offices were established: in 2014 a US East Coast headquarters opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts, followed by an office opening in San Diego in 2018. Software ChemAxon Products include tools for visualization and drawing of molecules, chemical database searching and management, and for drug discovery. Products are licensed free of charge for academic use. ChemAxon‚Äôs desktop applications include Marvin which is free chemistry software for drawing and visualizing chemical structures, and Instant JChem, a desktop application for end user scientists; JChem for Excel which integrates the structure handling capabilities of JChem and Marvin within a Microsoft Excel environment. The software can be used to predict pKa values and logP values. The company developed Markush structure storage and search capabilities (without enumeration), with Markush structures from Thomson Reuters Derwent World Patents Index (DWPISM) database. IP data Feed Pearson Education uses ChemAxon's JChem, MarvinSketch, and MarvinView as the chemistry tools in many of Pearson MasteringChemistry courses.

Kelly co-founded Kingfish in 1973 with New Riders of the Purple Sage bass player Dave Torbert and fellow San Francisco Bay Area musicians Robbie Hoddinott (lead guitar), Chris Herold (drums), and Mick Ward (keyboards). Ward died in a car accident later that year, and was replaced by Barry Flast, another keyboardist from San Francisco. In 1974, Kingfish became more well known, and signed their first record contract, after Grateful Dead guitarist and singer Bob Weir, a long-time friend of Kelly's, joined the band. (Kelly had previously been a guest musician on the Grateful Dead album Wake of the Flood.) Weir toured with Kingfish and was a band member on their first two albums, Kingfish and Live 'n' Kickin'. When the Dead started touring again in 1976, Weir left Kingfish, along with Hoddinott and Herold, who were then replaced by Michael O'Neill (lead guitar) and David Perper (drums). (Kelly later appeared on the Grateful Dead albums Shakedown Street and The Closing of Winterland, and on Weir's album Bobby and the Midnites. In 1995 he became a founding member of Weir's band Ratdog.) The lineup of the band continued to change, with Kelly and Torbert remaining at the core. Then, in 1979 Torbert and Kelly parted ways and Torbert formed a new lineup with Danny \\"Rio\\" DeGennaro and Michael O'Neill on guitars and sharing lead vocals. Also part of that lineup were Steve Shive (drums) and Ralph Liberto (keyboards, saxophone). Dave Torbert died of a heart attack in 1982. Starting in 1984, Kingfish would regroup from time to time and go on tour with a gradually evolving lineup of musicians led by Matthew Kelly. In 1987, Kelly also released a solo album called A Wing and a Prayer. In 1999 Kingfish released a new studio album, Sundown on the Forest, recorded over a period of several years with different combinations of musicians, including Bob Weir and a number of other Kingfish veterans. Kelly had left RatDog the year before, and was living in Hawaii. Since then Kingfish has not performed live. Danny DeGennaro was shot to death on December 28, 2011.

The board relied heavily on Creation Science Association of Mid America material in constructing science standards that minimized the tuition of evolution.The Christian Right in American Politics, John Clifford Green, Mark J. Rozell, Clyde Wilcox, p 157 However, the Board reversed this decision February 14, 2001, ruling that instruction of all those topics was mandatory and that they would appear on standardized tests. Then on August 9, 2005, the Board approved a draft of science curriculum standards that mandated equal time for the theories of \\"evolution\\" and \\"intelligent design\\". But on February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. The definition of science was once again limited to \\"the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe\\",Evolution of Kansas science standards continues as Darwin's theories regain prominence or what is known as \\"methodological naturalism\\".

The album was Jones' tenth studio album release since his debut LP in 1956. It would be one of his last with Mercury Records, as he switched to United Artists in late 1961. The album featured Jones' covers of hits in the \\"Country and Western Charts,\\" that were previously recorded by his fellow country artists or himself. It featured his second #1 hit \\"Window Up Above,\\" released the previous year. The LP became one Jones' best sounds during the early 1960s, released after another great album, \\"Salutes Hank Williams.\\" Background Sings Country and Western Hits would be Jones's last album with Mercury. As Colin Escott observes in the liner notes to the Jones retrospective Cup of Loneliness: The Classic Mercury Years, \\"Mercury lost George just as he was on the verge of ruling the charts. Art Talmadge had left Mercury Records and gone to United Artists and when George's Mercury contract expired at the end of 1961, Pappy (Daily, Jones's producer and mentor) took him to U.A. The first single, the classic \\"She Thinks I Still Care\\", was one of seven records George would chart in 1962.\\" Recording and composition ;Window Up Above Sings Country and Western Hits features hits made famous by other artists but also include songs closely identified with Jones, especially \\"The WIndow Up Above\\". As the singer explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, \\"I wrote it in about twenty minutes. I just came in off the road, about eight in the morning. While breakfast was being fixed, I just sat down in the den and picked up the guitar, and it was as simple as that. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to even figure where the ideas come from.\\" In his book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Bob Allen notes that when Jones recorded the song in 1960, \\"he sang it in a taut, almost offhand manner that called to mind the style of one of his heroes, Lefty Frizzell. He sang it in a manner which merely insinuated the presence of the wild, barely suppressed emotions seething just under the surface...\\" The song remained on the country charts for more than eight months, and George even had Nudie Cohn make him a stage suit based on it, a chartreuse affair replete with faces peering forlornly from sequin-stitched window frames. The song would later be covered by Loretta Lynn, Leon Russell, and Mickey Gilley, whose 1975 rendition would hit number one on the country charts. =Album information= (the following was written on the back of the LP record cover) The history of country and western music has seen many names emerge as top singing stars. However, only few have risen to such a height that their name will live in country music forever. The first to reach this plateau was the legendary Jimmie Rodgers, who made country music a popular boom. The next artist that would gain a reputation that would make him live forever in the hearts of country music lovers was Hank Williams. William's star rose overnight despite a full field of competition. Hank gained his reputation from not only singing, but also because he wrote songs that would be sung for decades to come, such as; \\"Cold, Cold Heart,\\" \\"Half as Much.\\" When Hank Williams met his untimely end, many wondered who would be the next artist to claim the title of \\"king of country and western music.\\" The answer was not long in coming‚ÄîGeorge Jones. George Jones, oddly enough, has the same qualities that made Hank Williams a legend. George not only sings c&w; tunes the way they should be sung, but he also is a songwriter of note. Among his compositions are such stellar tunes as \\"Life to Go,\\" \\"Just One More,\\" (both were rerecordings during an April 1960 session) Also included in his latest national best selling hit, \\"Window Up Above.\\" George Jones has proven to be a composer who can write about people, love, and tragedy, and he can also write songs of faith. (Window Up Above was recorded in Early April, 1960) The country and western field of music is peculiarly for and about people and its music tells about people and their feelings. In the words of a famous critic: \\"If a country singer can't feel what his audience is feeling, he's neither a country singer, nor a singer.\\" The popularity of country music is, and has been, expanding every year. Through the medium of radio, country music reached into the city and the country. Country music is more and more finding hefty sells in markets. All of this is because country music is universal and country music is universal and country artists with their fellow man on all levels. A rare talent is required to sell himself to the people on this down-to-earth basis and such a talent is the handsome lad from Beaumont, Texas‚ÄîGeorge Jones. His first few records saw enjoyed moderate success and then in 1955, George recorded \\"Why Baby, Why,\\" and the start of his fabulous career took wings. He later joined the WSM Grand Ole Opry and took on a professional polish. By now, his single recordings of \\"White Lightning\\" and \\"Who Shot Sam\\" were top national hits. Since joining Mercury Records, Jones has recorded four albums, each being greater than the one before and each bringing him a new host of fans. Each album saw George Jones perform in a different character, Gospel, country, his own tunes, and a salute to Hank Williams. Now, in his latest album, George Jones sings the top country and western hits from the past. His voice and his feelings for these numbers are unequalled in bringing you the tops in recorded listening pleasure. Certainly, there can be no better tribute for this kind of music which is \\"of the people, for the people, and by the people\\" than to have it sung and played by the greatest ‚ÄîGeorge Jones. Reception Eugene Chadbourne of AllMusic writes of Sings Country and Western Hits: \\"This is a recording of songs played pure and simple, from the heart and for a little bit of money, and recorded properly but without a lot of production hoopla\\" and suggest listening to it is the equivalent of going to hear a really great country cover band in which Jones is the lead singer.

A Marxist for much of his life, Mille was noted for his vocal support of peasant emancipation, for his early involvement with the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR), and his presence at the head of several magazines, culminating in his association with the moderate left-wing newspapers AdevƒÉrul and Diminea≈£a. After serving as an independent member of the Chamber of Deputies for one mandate (1899-1903), he aligned his views with those of Take Ionescu, and became a supporter of Romania's entry into World War I alongside the Entente Powers. In addition to his political career, Mille was the author of two autobiographical novels (Dinu Millian, 1884, and O via≈£ƒÉ, 1914). Biography =Early life and literature= Born in Ia≈üi, he later indicated, in his Dinu Millian (written on the model set by Jules Vall√®s),George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. Compendiu (\\"The History of Romanian Literature. Compendium\\"), Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1983, p.196-198 that his childhood had been a tragic one, with his father suffering from a mental disorder and his mother falling severely ill. Also according to his testimony, Mille spent much of his childhood and early youth in a boarding school. He attended the local university's Faculty of Law in autumn 1878, Ionel Maftei, \\"Constantin Mille, 75 de ani de la moarte\\" (Constantin Mille, 75 Years since His Death\\"), in Evenimentul, February 27, 2002 and became associated with other socialists, including the Russian-born Nicolae Russel, a physician and noted militant, as well as the locals Alexandru BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, and the brothers Ioan and Gheorghe NƒÉdejde. Henri H. Stahl, G√¢nditori ≈üi curente de istorie socialƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ (\\"Thinkers and Trends in Romanian Social History\\"), Cap.VII, \\"Curentul g√¢ndirii socialiste\\" (\\"The Trend of Socialist Thought\\") Mille also began his association with the Ia≈üi-based socialist magazine Contemporanul, which carried a polemic with the established literary society Junimea, 110 ani de social-democra≈£ie √Æn Rom√¢nia (\\"110 Years of Social Democracy in Romania\\") , Social Democratic Party, Ovidiu ≈ûincai Social Democratic Institute, Bucharest, July 9, 2003, p.11, 12, 13 and authored his first poems, collected in a \\"red notebook\\". Among his debut works was an 1882 poem honoring Vasile Conta, the materialist philosopher who had died in the same year.Tiberiu Avramescu, \\"C. Mille alias Gh. CopƒÉcineanu\\", in Magazin Istoric, June 1972, p.50-51 Allegedly winning Eminescu's admiration, his literary attempts were nonetheless later dismissed as \\"pure prose\\" by the influential writer and critic George CƒÉlinescu. A similar view was expressed by Traian Demetrescu (also known as Tradem), an eclectic poet who shared views with the Symbolists, and who contended that Mille lacked \\"a powerful talent, the original disposition of an artist\\", which had prevented him from \\"creating, out of [his] socialistic material, remarkable works\\". Corina Popescu, Verismul italian ≈üi literatura rom√¢nƒÉ (teatrul italian √Æn Rom√¢nia: 1871-1911) (\\"Italian Verism and Romanian Literature (Italian Theater in Romania: 1871-1911\\")) , Section 5: \\"Teatrul italian ‚Äì vehicul al influen≈£elor moderne √Æn literatura rom√¢nƒÉ\\" (\\"The Romanian Theater - the Vehicle of Modern Influences in Romanian Literature\\"), at the University of Bucharest site Tradem concluded that \\"[w]ithout profound meditation, without sensitivity, without imagination, an artist cannot become anything other than, at most, a fecund and passable worker, and not an illustrious figure that would endure\\". Most of Constantin Mille's prose works bear the imprint of Naturalism. With Russel and others, he organized the first General Congress of Romanian Students (1880), and ultimately attracted attention from the authorities, who, later in the same year, transported Russel out of the country as an agitator. =Studies abroad= Ultimately expelled from the faculty due to his politics, Mille left for France, where he attended the University of Paris (spring of 1882). He became one of the main figures in the Romanian students' left-wing circle of Paris ‚Äî together with, among others, Alexandru Radovici, the future minister Mihai SƒÉulescu, as well as VintilƒÉ and Horia Rosetti (the sons of Radical leader C. A. Rosetti). Mille and SƒÉulescu hatched up an intricate practical joke, designed to ridicule the Conservative Party and its press organ, Timpul: from early in 1882 and until September, using the name Gh[eorghe] CopƒÉcineanu, they sent letters to the editors, which presented imaginary, shock-value, accounts of student activities in the French capital, part of which specifically referred to Mille himself (among other things, they pretended that Mille had become a restaurateur, and that CopƒÉcineanu had been assailed by socialists armed with knives while crossing the Seine on the Austerlitz Bridge). The correspondence was published in its entirety by the Romanian newspaper, which led Mille to declare that \\"any inanity can fit in the journal's columns\\". Ultimately, Mille revealed that he was responsible for the whole affair (a notice published by Telegraful); although Timpul did not reply, Mihai Eminescu, the influential poet who worked in the journal's mail room and reviewed all letters, later confessed to Zamfir Arbore that he had \\"given approval for print without reading them\\". Mille completed his studies in Brussels, at the Universit√© Libre, being awarded a diploma in Law (1884). He returned to Romania during the same year, and settled in Bucharest, joining the local Bar association. =Bucharest socialist circle= The Bucharest socialist circle in 1892. Mille, holding his two daughters in his lap, is third seated from the left in the second row; next in line, seated: Vasile Mor≈£un and Constantin Dobrogeanu- Gherea. Artur Stavri is first seated from the left in the same row. Top row, standing, from the right: Ion PƒÉun-Pincio (third), Henri Sanielevici (fourth), Simion Sanielevici (eighth). Although initially an advocate of common-law marriage, Mille allegedly accepted a Romanian Orthodox ceremony, and, according to CƒÉlinescu, \\"defended [his new position] through ridiculous sophistry\\". A founding member of the socialist circle in Bucharest (known as Cercul de Studii Sociale, the Social Studies Circle), he joined Ioan NƒÉdejde in creating the magazine Drepturile Omului (published for several months in 1885 and reestablished in 1888, it ceased to exist in 1889).Heith Hitchins, \\"Rumania\\", in Marcel van der Linden, J√ºrgen Rojahn, The Formation of Labour Movements, 1870-1914: an International Perspective, Brill Publishers, Leiden, 1990, , p.389-390 The editors repeatedly issues calls for the creation of a working class party, and argued in favor of public ownership, but also took inspiration from Narodnik ideas (see Poporanism). According to Henri H. Stahl, during the late 1880s and early 1890s, Mille shared the vision of Vasile Mor≈£un, Alexandru G. Radovici and NƒÉdejde, which called on the socialist clubs to merge with progressive and radical forces such as George Panu's grouping. Henri H. Stahl, G√¢nditori ≈üi curente de istorie socialƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ (\\"Thinkers and Trends in Romanian Social History\\"), Cap.IX, \\"Curentele antigheriste\\" (\\"Anti-Dobrogeanu-Gherea Trends\\") Nicknamed the genero≈üi (\\"generous ones\\"), and arguing that Romanian socialism could only be established when capitalism had been fully developed, they thus disagreed with the mainstream Marxist theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. Most of these younger socialists associated with the socialist sympathizer Constantin Stere, and, a decade later, merged with the National Liberal Party (PNL). With Panait Mu≈üoiu and NƒÉdejde, Mille founded the magazine Munca, which was edited between 1890 and 1894.Z. Ornea, Via≈£a lui C. Stere (\\"The Life of C. Stere\\"), Vol. I, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 1989, p.149-150, 257-265, 413, 443, 500, 521-524 It followed in the wake of Contemporanul's 1891 disestablishment, and adhered to Dobrogeanu-Gherea's pamphlet Ce vor sociali≈ütii rom√¢ni? (\\"What Do the Romanian Socialists Want?\\", 1886), which had set the tone for unifying the various socialist groups in the country. Carrying the subtitle \\"Organ social democrat\\" (\\"Social democratic organ\\"), Munca effectively relocated the center of socialist activity from Ia≈üi to Bucharest, and had among its collaborators Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, Sofia NƒÉdejde, and Mihai Pastia. Associated with the labor movement and frequently reporting on strikes, the newspaper urged workers to organize into trade unions and popularized Marxist tenets. In 1891, NƒÉdejde, Mille and Mor≈£un issued a manifesto of the would-be socialist party (at the time, a loose rally of socialist clubs), entitled Manifest cƒÉtre ≈£ƒÉrani, √Æn numele Comitetului electoral al partidului (\\"Manifesto to the Peasants, in the Name of the Party's Election Committee\\"). =PSDMR episode and deputy= Adevƒïrul logo in 1888 In 1893, Mille joined the newly created PSDMR and stood among its most radical members, calling for immediate social reform. He was to be expelled from the group two years later, due to his purchase of AdevƒÉrul (known then as Adevƒïrul), which was considered bourgeois in tone. During the same period, AdevƒÉrul became involved in a heated debate with the literary magazine Viea≈£a, after publishing an article in irreverent tone which referred to the writer and editor Alexandru Vlahu≈£ƒÉ as \\"a scoundrel\\". From that moment on, Viea≈£a repeatedly issued unflattering reviews of works by socialist authors, and chronicled Mille's poetry under the derisive title \\"Pliviri\\" (\\"Weedings\\"). Taking over as editor-in-chief following Alexandru Beldiman's death in 1898, he led the paper into opposition to the PNL cabinet of Dimitrie Sturdza, whom he argued had betrayed the genero≈üi in his party by endorsing reactionary policies.\\"Via≈£a ≈üi luptele ziarului Adevƒïrul\\" (\\"Life and Combats\\"), in Diminea≈£a (anniversary issue), November 13, 1933 During the elections of 1899, the newspaper, through its correspondent Ioan Bacalba≈üa, investigated alleged violence by government forces in Slatina. At the time, Mille was proposed as an independent candidate for Teleorman County, running for the Third Electoral College (that of peasants), and came to serve a mandate in the Chamber of Deputies. He was again elected during the 1907 suffrage. The editorial staff of AdevƒÉrul in 1897: Mille is first seated from the left, with Ioan Bacalba≈üa standing behind him In December, following the arrival to power of Gheorghe Cantacuzino and the Conservative Party, AdevƒÉrul investigated and denounced the practices of a French firm who had failed to respect its obligations involving public works in Constan≈£a (see Hallier Affair). Their campaign culminated in the intervention of low-ranking police forces, who assaulted Mille and Bacalba≈üa ‚Äî while recovering, they were visited by the PNL's Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, who expressed his sympathy. Also in 1899, the PSDMR disbanded, when a scandal was caused by the presence of socialist clubs in the countryside ‚Äî of them, the PNL's Minister of the Interior Mihail Pherekyde claimed had been fermenting agitation, an accusation which met with protests from Mille and his AdevƒÉrul. In parallel, Munca's legacy was taken over in 1902 by Christian Rakovsky's Rom√¢nia Muncitoare, which was more radical in tone and hosted contributions by Mille. As deputy, he unsuccessfully promoted universal suffrage, and notably called for the reduction of tariffs on products of strict necessity to peasants. =Early 1900s causes= Interested in international causes, Mille was, by 1903, a vocal supporter of Alfred Dreyfus and √âmile Zola during the Dreyfus Affair which split France into two rival political camps, one in arguing in favor of nationalism and militarism and the other in favor of justice and human rights. Constantin Antip, \\"√âmile Zola: ¬´AdevƒÉrul este √Æn mar≈ü¬ª\\" (\\"√âmile Zola: ¬´Truth Is Marching On¬ª\\") , in Magazin Istoric Writing at the time, he identified the Third Republic's influential conservative, revanchist and antisemitic groups with a \\"militarist dictatorship\\". In following years, Constantin Mille and AdevƒÉrul became opponents of the foreign policy endorsed by the new Sturdza cabinet, and denounced the convention signed with Austria-Hungary regarding, among other things, the duty to extradite Austrian citizens who took refuge to Romania ‚Äî Mille argued that this was disadvantageous to ethnic Romanian political activists in Transylvania, Bukovina, and the Banat. He took the same stand on similar issues involving relations with the Russian and Ottoman Empires, calling for Bessarabians, Albanians and Aromanians who had evaded to Romania not to be persecuted. Additionally, in 1905, as the mutinous battleship Potemkin took refuge in Constan≈£a, he and his newspapers asked the Cantacuzino government to offer sailors safe haven. He issued his second daily in 1904: begun as a morning edition of AdevƒÉrul, Diminea≈£a soon became a paper on its own, and, through it, Mille was responsible for bringing in several innovations in the local press.\\"Cum a apƒÉrut Diminea≈£a\\" (\\"How Diminea≈£a Came to Be\\"), in Diminea≈£a (anniversary issue), November 13, 1933 He introduced colored print and images, leading Diminea≈£a to claim that it was the first daily to be published in color (1912), and was the first in his country to make use of Linotype machines (1907). During the large-scale Peasants' Revolt of 1907, he voiced criticism of the governing PNL for the violent manner in which it opted to repress protests, Anton Caragea, \\"RƒÉscoalƒÉ sau complot?\\" (\\"Revolt or Conspiracy?\\") , in Magazin Istoric and questioned the attitudes of former socialists who had joined the latter group (including Constantin Stere, who was serving as prefect). At the time, Mille wrote: > \\"Pacification, not cruelty! We do not wish to start a campaign on this > painful issue. We hope that we will be heard and not have to alert public > opinion, because calm is required in these murky and unfortunate times. Yet > we cannot allow that, after the savagery of peasant gangs, follow the > savagery of people coming ¬´with the law¬ª.\\" Additionally, Mille's paper called for reparations to be paid to victims' families, for an amnesty to be declared, and for Vasile KogƒÉlniceanu, an activist who supported the peasant cause and faced trial, to be set free; it also published the influential protest of Ion Luca Caragiale (1907 din primƒÉvarƒÉ p√¢nƒÉ'n toamnƒÉ, \\"1907 from Spring till Autumn\\"), which questioned the establishment and policies of Romania. Immediately after the Revolt, AdevƒÉrul was among the sources to make the controversial claim that 11,000 peasants had perished in the events. \\"Un secol de la RƒÉscoala din 1907\\" (\\"A Century since the 1907 Revolt\\") , Romanian Academy report, in Curentul, March 30, 2007 According to historian Anton Caragea, a confidential report of that year, presented to his superiors by the Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Secret Service agent G√ºnther, informed that Mille, as well as the editors of Universul and Epoca, had been advanced sums of money in order to exaggerate the amplitude of repression, and to incite both local and international outrage. The importance and extent of Austro-Hungarian agitation remains a debated subject: it has also been argued that, in concrete terms, foreign influence proved to be insignificant. =1908-1914 politics= After 1908, Mille sided with the Take Ionescu-led politicians who split from the Conservative Party to form the Conservative-Democratic grouping. Like Ionescu, he supported measures for the union Transylvania, Banat, and Bukovina with the Kingdom of Romania, and visited the region to attend meetings of the Romanian National Party, but, in 1908, came into conflict with its prominent activist Iuliu Maniu ‚Äî while Mille insisted that Romanians in Transylvania and the Banat were to seek collaboration with left-wing forces in Romania, Maniu presented a purely nationalist perspective, indicated that he expected support from the entire Romanian community. Sever Bocu, According to Sever Bocu, who witnessed the debate, Mille considered Maniu's position \\"reactionary\\". AdevƒÉrul notably condemned the disadvantageous trade convention signed between Romania and Austria-Hungary, signaled that Romanians in the region were being subjected to violence, and alleged that the Austro-Hungarian state had included within its borders ridges of the Carpathians that it had no right to own. When an attempt on the life of PNL Premier Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, carried out by a certain Stoenescu, occurred in December 1909, authorities took the measure of arresting Rom√¢nia Muncitoare editors, who were believed to be instigators of the attack. In reaction to this, Constantin Mille accused the genero≈üi of having left room for confusion inside the socialist camp by way of their departure to the PNL, and speculated that, through their tacit acceptance of PNL politics, they had provoked a rise in the popularity of \\"Anarchism\\". A wider polemic ensued when the socialist-turned-Liberal Garabet IbrƒÉileanu replied in Viitorul, defending those principles advocated by the genero≈üi in front of both Mille and Dobrogeanu-Gherea. In 1911, Mille wrote several articles defending Alexandru Nicolau, an activist of the newly created Social Democratic Party who was facing trial for his vocal criticism of the Romanian Army (Nicolau was eventually acquitted). Gheorghe BrƒÉtescu, Constantin Titel Petrescu, at the Social Democratic Party-Constantin Titel Petrescu site =World War I= At a time when the socialist movement grouped itself around the Zimmerwald Movement and called for Romania to stay out of the World War, Mille became instead a vocal supporter of joining the Entente Powers, insisting that Romania should assist France and take over Transylvania. In a 1915 letter to Leon Trotsky, the influential socialist and Zimmerwald partisan Christian Rakovsky accused Mille of having been corrupted by Take Ionescu, and of using his newspapers for propaganda \\"under the mask of independence\\". Christian Rakovsky, Les socialistes et la guerre (\\"The Socialists and War\\"), at the Marxists Internet Archive He also claimed: \\"[Ionescu] thus compensated for the weakness of his party, both in men and ideas, through corrupting the press\\". As the Romanian Campaign witnessed the occupation of Bucharest by the Central Powers, Mille and several of his collaborators took refuge to Ia≈üi, while other AdevƒÉrul journalists were arrested by German forces and deported to Bulgaria. He returned after the Treaty of Bucharest. When the strike of compositors in Bucharest (December 13, 1918), organized by the Socialist Party of Romania, was repressed in violence by the authorities ‚Äî who saw in it signs of Bolshevik agitation) ‚Äî, Mille joined Constantin Titel Petrescu, Radu R. Rosetti, N. D. Cocea, and Toma Dragu on the defense team of arrested Socialists (of them, only communist sympathizers such as Alecu Constantinescu were found guilty, all sentenced to 5 years in prison). =Final years= After the war, Mille began editing the magazine Lupta. Vartan Arachelian, \\"Iubire ≈üi destin: Carol al II-lea ≈üi Zizi Lambrino (V)\\" (Love and Destiny: Carol II and Zizi Lambrino\\" , in Jurnalul Na≈£ional, January 7, 2006Gy√∂rgy Litv√°n, A Twentieth-Century Prophet: Oscar J√°szi 1875-1957, Central European University Press, Budapest, 2006, , p.248 Again present in Transylvania in 1921, he notably met and conversed with Hungarian historian and sociologist Oszk√°r J√°szi. In 1923, he helped create Liga Drepturilor Omului (the League for Human Rights), reuniting a left- leaning activists such as Titel Petrescu, Rosetti, Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru, Virgil Madgearu, Constantin Costa-Foru, Nicolae L. Lupu, Dem I. Dobrescu, Victor Eftimiu, and Grigore Iunian; it was active until 1928. He gradually ceased his work at AdevƒÉrul and, shortly before his death, handed the paper over to a consortium headed by Aristide Blank. In January 1926, during the final stage of a scandal involving Prince Carol's wartime morganatic marriage to Zizi Lambrino, he came to the attention of the secret police, Siguran≈£a Statului, for supporting her claim that the marriage was illegally annulled by the Supreme Court, and for offering her assistance at a time when she visited Bucharest (according to Siguran≈£a Statului, the two were related).

The album was recorded at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland, with producers Hiili Hiilesmaa and Tim Palmer, both whom had collaborated with the band on various occasions, and released on 14 September 2007. During the making of Venus Doom, HIM was struggling with the personal problems of their vocalist Ville Valo. Among other things, his alcohol abuse had worsened to the point that he suffered a nervous breakdown during the recording process, after which he was admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by HIM's manager Seppo Vesterinen. Musically the album has been described as HIM's heaviest and darkest album to date, with influences from bands, such as My Dying Bride, Anathema and Paradise Lost. Much of the album's lyrical themes and heaviness were inspired by Valo's personal difficulties, including his break-up with fianc√© Jonna Nygr√©n. Venus Doom received positive reviews from critics, with many commending the album's heaviness and experimentation. The album charted in thirteen countries, including the top ten in four. Venus Doom was eventually certified gold in Finland and gave the band their highest US chart position to date at number twelve. The album also gave the band their first Grammy nomination for \\"Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package\\". Two singles were released, with \\"The Kiss of Dawn\\" reaching number two in Finland. During the summer of 2007, HIM toured across the United States as a part of Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution Tour, as well as opening for Metallica in Europe. HIM began the supporting tour for Venus Doom in the fall of 2007 in North America, followed by the UK, before returning to Europe in early 2008. Production In September 2006, HIM cancelled a forthcoming North American tour in support of their previous album Dark Light to begin work on new material. In February 2007, the band entered Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland, to record their sixth studio album, with producers Hiili Hiilesmaa and Tim Palmer, both of whom had previously worked on the band's 2003 album Love Metal. After three months of recording, the album was mixed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles by Tim Palmer, and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York.Venus Doom album sleeve notes. For the album's front cover the band used a painting by artist David Harouni, that vocalist Ville Valo had purchased while on tour in New Orleans. The painting had been hanging on Valo's living room wall while he was writing material for the album, so he felt it was only natural to use it as the cover art. The title Venus Doom continues the band's tradition of contrasts in album titles, with Venus being the Roman goddess of love, and doom representing Judgement Day and doom metal. The making-of the album was plagued with problems Valo was facing in his personal life.Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine ‚Äì pg. 21 Exhaustion and his break-up with fianc√©e Jonna Nygr√©n had severely affected Valo's worsening alcohol abuse, resulting in him reportedly vomiting and defecating blood at one point. All these issues came to a head when Valo suffered a nervous breakdown during the recording process. Valo did manage to recuperate, until the mixing stage, when he began drinking again. Eventually he was admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by the band's manager Seppo Vesterinen. Music and lyrics Venus Doom has been described as HIM's heaviest and darkest album to date, and was written with the intent of creating a much heavier and darker follow-up to Dark Light. Valo stated that the band's idea was to combine Loveless by My Bloody Valentine and Master of Puppets by Metallica, and that the album drew on some of the band's early influences, including My Dying Bride, Anathema and Paradise Lost. Valo also described Venus Doom as a more personal album than previous efforts, as well as more \\"organic\\" and \\"violent\\". Valo also wrote some of the album while in Sirkka, Lapland. Speaking on the sound of the album, BBC described it as a \\"grand, gothic metal [record] combined with cod-mysticism, crunchy guitars, thrashy drums and a breathy vocal delivery tinged with effects.\\" Talking about the themes explored on Venus Doom, Valo stated: \\"Lyrically, it's about me losing a relationship and then actually regaining it, and losing my sanity and regaining it [...] It's like me getting rid of my demons and putting the pain in the music.\\" The title-track talks about \\"how much love has to suffer for our humankind's insanity and our stupidity to get through to our jaded, cold hearts\\". \\"Passion's Killing Floor\\" was included on the soundtrack album of the 2007 film Transformers, while \\"The Kiss of Dawn\\" was partly inspired by a friend of Valo's who committed suicide. In \\"Song or Suicide\\", Valo used lines from the poems of Finnish author Timo K. Mukka, while the title was inspired by American singer-songwriter Judee Sill. Valo also described the song as being very \\"positive\\", and talks about the \\"feeling that you have enough to do and say, at least for yourself, not to end your days, and not to want to leave this world.\\" The track was also recorded at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. \\"Sleepwalking Past Hope\\" is the longest song in HIM's catalogue and was partly inspired by Valo's relationship with Jonna Nygr√©n. Valo explained, stating: \\"It's about 'When do you really want to let go?' 'When is the time?', because nobody can tell you the time to let go of a relationship or let go of yourself.\\" Release and promotion HIM performing in Marysville, California in August 2007 Venus Doom was originally scheduled to be released on 10 July 2007, but was pushed back to September in May 2007. From 25 July to 3 September 2007, HIM toured the US with Linkin Park on their Projekt Revolution Tour, which also included My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday and Placebo. Prior to the beginning of the tour, HIM also held a contest for fans to win a trip to meet the band at tour's opening date in Seattle. The winners of the contest would also be featured on a forthcoming live DVD. HIM also played a number of concerts in the summer of 2007 opening for Metallica on their Sick of the Studio '07 Tour, including a show at Wembley Stadium in London, England. \\"The Kiss of Dawn\\" was released as the first single from Venus Doom on 28 July 2007, and reached number two in Finland, number 30 in Sweden, number 44 in Germany, and number 59 in the UK. \\"Bleed Well\\" followed later that year as the second single from the album. Both also received music videos. Venus Doom was released on 14 September 2007, and charted in thirteen countries, including at number two in Finland, number three in Germany, number five in Switzerland, and number nine in Austria.Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine ‚Äì pg. 125 The album also gave HIM their highest US chart position to date at number twelve. Venus Doom was eventually certified gold in Finland, and was also nominated for the \\"Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package\\", as well as \\"Rock Album of the Year\\" at the 2007 Emma Awards. HIM began the North American leg of the supporting tour for Venus Doom on 18 October 2007 in Sayreville, New Jersey, with Bleeding Through serving as support. The band's shows at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles on 14 and 15 November 2007 were also filmed and recorded, and later released as the live album Digital Versatile Doom on 29 April 2008. In December 2007 HIM toured across the UK, before starting a European tour in early 2008. Reception Venus Doom received positive reviews from critics, with an average score of 67 out of 100 on Metacritic. NME described it as \\"an extremely well-executed pop-metal album\\", while Aaron Burgess of Spin called the album \\"may be the year's heaviest, creepiest, and sexiest hard-rock group effort\\". He also commended the rest of the band for being able to stretch out alongside Valo. Sauli Vuoti of Soundi awarded Venus Doom four stars out five and described as \\"dark, depressing and extremely twisted\\". He also gave praise to guitarist Mikko \\"Linde\\" Lindstr√∂m's performance, and called \\"Sleepwalking Past Hope\\" \\"melancholic HIM at their best\\". Vuoti did compare Venus Doom as being less \\"hit-focused\\" and \\"straightforward\\" than Dark Light, describing the album as more \\"experimental\\". Rumba's Janne Flinkkil√§ also gave the album four out five stars, and while he did comment on the band's intent on repeating themselves, he still touted Venus Doom as HIM's best album, with special praise being given to Valo's vocal performance. Mape Ollila of Imperiumi.net also called Venus Doom the band's heaviest and darkest album yet, awarding the album eight-plus out of ten. He also commended the band's decision not to repeat the formula of Dark Light to gain more success. NOW also commended the band's choice to experiment, while Rolling Stone stated: \\"The melodies tend toward the lush, while underneath, Valo's bandmates rock with fury and efficiency, ensuring that all the heartbroken laments are badass enough for hardcore metalheads.\\" Allmusic's Jason Lymangrover gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, and described the album as finding the band \\"back on track and sounding more metal than ever.\\" He did criticize the lyrics, but also stated that \\"most fans of the band don't want to philosophize, they want to hear the group rock out, and this release shows them doing precisely that, even harder than before.\\" Eamonn Stack of the BBC was also positive in his review of Venus Doom, describing the album as \\"instantly catchy, heavy and melodramatic, and produced with polish and with some great choruses\\", but did feel that the material lacked variety. Jarkko Jokelainen of Helsingin Sanomat was more mixed in his review, giving kudos to the Lindstr√∂m's guitar playing and the arrangements, but overall felt that the album lacked the hit-potential of Dark Light. Valo later ranked Venus Doom as one of his favorite albums by the band, and in 2017 described it as a \\"tribute album to the artists, because of whom we formed the band\\", and as a \\"look at personal limits through the lenses of Melleri and Mukka. The search for the core of Slavic melancholy.\\" Loudwire later ranked Venus Doom fifth in the band's discography, describing it as \\"focusing more on chunky, heaving riffs\\" and displaying \\"HIM's dynamic interplay between unchained love and heartbreak\\". Kaaoszine ranked the album as HIM's fourth-best album, calling it \\"one of the band's strongest albums as a whole\\". \\"Sleepwalking Past Hope\\" was also voted the band's best song by the readers of Metal Hammer in 2017.

The Soviet military handed the Polish prisoners over to the Narodnyy komissariat vnutrennikh del (People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, better known as the NKVD or secret police), they received sentences under clauses in the Soviet penal code relating to crimes including treason and counter-revolution, and were not considered subject to the \\"Regulations for the Treatment of Prisoners of War\\" approved by the Soviet Council of Ministers.Sanford, p. 25 and p. 41. As early as September 19, 1939, the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and First Rank Commissar of State Security, Lavrenty Beria, ordered the NKVD to create the Administration for Affairs of Prisoners of War and Internees to manage Polish prisoners. The NKVD took custody of Polish prisoners from the Red Army and proceeded to organize a network of reception centers and transit camps and to arrange rail transport to prisoner-of-war camps in the western USSR. The camps were located at Jukhnovo (Babynino rail station), Yuzhe (Talitsy), Kozelsk, Kozelshchyna, Oranki, Ostashkov (Stolbnyi Island on Seliger Lake near Ostashkov), Tyotkino rail station (56 mi/90 km from Putyvl), Starobielsk, Vologda (Zaenikevo rail station) and Gryazovets.\\"The grave unknown elsewhere or any time before ...

The 25,000 soldiers and non- commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy). Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers such as Vasily Zarubin. The Soviets encouraged the Poles to believe they would be released,\\"The Katyn Diary of Leon Gladun\\", last accessed on 19 December 2005, English translation of Polish document. See the entries on 25 December 1939 and 3 April 1940. but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, the prisoners could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude. They were declared \\"hardened and uncompromising enemies of Soviet authority\\". On March 5, 1940, a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria saw the members of the Soviet Politburo -- Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Mikhail Kalinin, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan and Beria -- signed an order for the execution of \\"nationalists and counter- revolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in western Ukraine and Belarus. This execution became known as the Katyn massacre.where 22,000 perished Second period (1941‚Äì1944) Diplomatic relations were, however, re- established in 1941 after the German invasion of the Soviet Union forced Joseph Stalin to look for allies.

Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government-in-exile and Stalin, the Soviets granted \\"amnesty\\" to many Polish citizens, from whom a military force was formed. Stalin also agreed that this military force would be subordinate to the Polish government-in-exile. This force was known as the Anders Army. From 1943 Poles were recruited into the Berling Army. Third period (after 1944) The third group of Polish prisoners were members of Polish resistance organizations (Armia Krajowa, or 'cursed soldiers') loyal to the Polish government-in-exile and seen by the Soviets as a threat to their establishment of a power base in Poland. Relatively few were sent to the Soviet Union (although there were notable exceptions, see Trial of the Sixteen); most were transferred to the Polish communist security forces and prisons, or enlisted in the Berling Army.

Weintraub is an American attorney who serves as a Commissioner on the Federal Election Commission.  Career  Ellen Weintraub began her career in private practice as a litigator with the New York firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel. Weintraub was then counsel to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for the U.S. House of Representatives (the House Ethics Committee), where she advised members on investigations. She focused on implementing the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 () and subsequent changes to the House Code of Official Conduct. She also served as editor in chief of the House Ethics Manual and as a principal contributor to the Senate Ethics Manual. Weintraub subsequently returned to private practice as counsel at Perkins Coie LLP, where she was a member of its Political Law Group. There, she counseled clients on federal and state campaign finance laws, political ethics, nonprofit law, and lobbying regulation. During the election contest arising out of the 1996 election of Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Weintraub served on the legal team that advised the Senate Rules Committee. Weintraub received a recess appointment to the Federal Election Commission on December 6, 2002, and took office on December 9, 2002. She was renominated on January 9, 2003, and confirmed by unanimous consent of the United States Senate on March 18, 2003. Shortly after her arrival at the FEC, Weintraub was elected Chair of the Commission for 2003. She is the third woman to serve on the Commission, following Republicans Lee Ann Elliott and Joan Aikens. In June 2008, two more women, Democrat Cynthia L. Bauerly and Republican Caroline C. Hunter, joined Weintraub on the Commission. In July 2013, while Weintraub was serving as Chair, the Commission ruled that legally married same-sex couples must be treated the same as opposite-sex couples under election law. In February 2017, Weintraub called on President Donald Trump to reveal his evidence of voter fraud after the president claimed that it caused him and former Senator Kelly Ayotte to lose in New Hampshire in the 2016 U.S. election. ‚ÄúThe scheme the President of the United States alleges would constitute thousands of felony criminal offences under New Hampshire law,‚Äù Weintraub said in a statement printed on FEC letterhead.\\"Statement of Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub Regarding Allegations by the President of the United States of Widespread Voter Fraud in New Hampshire,\\" February 10, 2017. As a result, an organization funded by the Koch brothers, Cause of Action, issued a statement calling for her to be investigated for ethics violations.\\"What The Media Should Know About Cause Of Action, The Koch-Backed Group Suing Over Clinton's Emails,\\" Media Matters, July 9, 2015. Weintraub subsequently defended her actions and maintained that the alleged fraud would constitute a violation of federal campaign finance laws, which is germane to her position as a FEC commissioner. In August 2019, at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, President Trump repeated these claims. He complained to reporters and to his supporters that he had narrowly lost the state because of fraudulent voting, a claim for which he gave no evidence. \\"New Hampshire should have been won last time, except we had a lot of people come in at the last moment, which was a rather strange situation,\\" Trump told journalists. \\"Thousands and thousands of people, coming in from locations unknown.\\" Commissioner Weintraub followed these claims with a letter asking Trump to produce evidence of these assertions. During 2017, Weintraub championed greater disclosure of political ads on the internet, and helped move the FEC to open a rulemaking on the matter with bipartisan support. On December 18, 2018 she was once again elected Chair. Weintraub's term ended April 30, 2007, but she continues in office until her successor takes office.52 U.S.C. ¬ß 30106(a)(2)(B) She is not eligible for reappointment.

An educational video game is a video game that provides learning or training value to the player. Edutainment describes an intentional merger of video games and educational software into a single product (and could therefore also comprise more serious titles sometimes described under children's learning software). In the narrower sense used here, the term describes educational software which is primarily about entertainment, but tends to educate as well and sells itself partly under the educational umbrella. Normally software of this kind is not structured towards school curricula and does not involve educational advisors. Educational video games play a significant role in the school curriculum for teachers who seek to deliver core lessons, reading and new skills. Gamification of education allows learners to take active roles in learning and develop technological skills that are needed for their academic and professional careers. Several recent studies have shown that video games, whether violent or not can help children in the development of intellectual and emotional skills that support their academic achievement (Chang et al., 2009). These findings have made teachers all over the world recognize the numerous benefits of gaming and to include educational video game learning in their curricula. Definition There can be also defined strategy war games that include historical references, like the Total War franchise or the Age of Empires trilogy and an in-game encyclopaedia like Civilization. These games often integrate education without being explicitly educational. These are games which were originally developed for adults or older children and which have potential learning implications. For the most part, these games provide simulations of different kinds of human activities, allowing players to explore a variety of social, historical and economic processes. Examples: * City-building games such as the SimCity series and Caesar (1993‚Äì2006) invite players to explore the social, practical and economic processes involved in city management; * Empire- building games such as the Civilization series (1991‚Äì2013) and the Europa Universalis series (2000‚Äì2014) help players to learn about history and its political, economic and military aspects; * Railroad management games such as Railroad Tycoon (1990‚Äì2003) and Rails Across America (2001) illuminate the history, engineering and economics of railroad management. * Geography games such as PlaceSpotting (2008‚Äì2009) help players to find locations on earth according to some hints. * Physics games such as Quantum Moves and A Slower Speed of Light aim to impart intuition for complicated physics concepts such as quantum mechanics and special relativity. * Trading and commerce based games such as The Patrician challenge players to create and grow a trading empire managing acquiring, processing, transporting, and bartering resources within a limited region. The games have been enthusiastically received in some educational circles and are mentioned in academic literature. A new category was recently started by Bot Colony (2013). It can be used to practice English dialogue by conversing with intelligent robots as part of an adventure game. Design Many titles were developed and released from the mid-1990s onwards, aimed primarily at the home education of young children. Later iterations of these titles often began to link educational content to school curricula such as England's National Curriculum. The design of educational games for home use has been influenced by gaming concepts ‚Äì they are designed to be fun and educational. Examples of children's learning software which have a structured pedagogical approach, usually orientated towards literacy and numeracy skills. * Disney Interactive learning titles based on characters such as Winnie-the- Pooh, Aladdin, The Jungle Book and Mickey Mouse * GCompris, contains numerous activities, from computer discovery to science * Knowledge Adventure's JumpStart and Blaster Learning System series * The Learning Company's Reader Rabbit, The ClueFinders and Zoombinis series. History The early mainframe game The Sumerian Game (1964) was, while not the first resource management game, the first designed for elementary school students. In 1970 Abt published a book on the topic: \\"Serious games: The art and science of games that simulate life.\\".Abt, C. C. (1970). Serious games: The art and science of games that simulate life. USA: New Yorks Viking. In September 1983 the Boston Phoenix reported that \\"edutainment\\" games were a new focus area for companies after end of growth of the Atari 2600 software market. In 1983, the term \\"edutainment\\" was used to describe a package of software games for the Oric 1 and Spectrum Microcomputers in the UK. Dubbed \\"arcade edutainment\\" an advertisement for the package can be found in various issues of \\"Your Computer\\" magazine from 1983. The software package was available from Telford ITEC a government sponsored training program. The originator of the name was Chris Harvey who worked at ITEC at the time. Since then, many other computer games such as Electronic Arts's Seven Cities of Gold, released in 1984, have also used edutainment as a descriptive term. Most edutainment games seek to teach players by employing a game-based learning approach. Criticism as to which video games can be considered educational has led to the creation of \\"serious games\\" whose primary focus is to teach rather than entertain.Djaouti, D., Alvarez, J., Jessel, J., & Rampnoux, O. (2011). Origins of Serious Games. Serious Games and Edutainment Applications. Psychologist Simon Egenfeldt- Nielsen researched the educational use and potential of computer games and has written many articles on the subject. One paper dealing specifically with edutainment breaks it down into 3 generational categories to separate the cognitive methods most predominantly used to teach. He is critical of the research that has been done on the educational use of computer games, citing their biases and weaknesses in method, which cause their findings to lack scientific validity. In education Games provide structure to problem- solving. This allows a player to \\"fail up\\", meaning that with the combination of challenging and fun and identity-building, the student will want to continue to persist on that problem until it is solved. It is a productive failure. This may take quite a few times before success is reached, but progress is obtained each time and so is knowledge on how to solve that problem. Iteration and discovery become two major aspects to learning through game playing. Many students have a \\"sweet spot\\" for gaming, which allows gaming in education to be successful in terms of grasping concepts, while this can be more difficult through the use of a book. Students may not even realize that they are learning through a game. Games need to include novelty. Unexpected occurrences and challenging choices allow the player to want to keep playing. Having a story or narrative in the game is what can really suck a player into the game. It allows for continuous feedback and challenges at the right level of difficulty, while avoiding frustration. When developing successful learning games for the classroom, it can be a challenging task. In order for the game to show achievement in student learning, the games should hold certain qualities. The development of successful games to promote learning requires attention to opposing factors. Creativity and inventiveness is needed to help the outcome work well and run smoothly. Games should take the opposite approach of drill-and-practice principles, as this simplifies the games and limits the domains of knowledge. The three factors to keep in mind when designing strong and successful games are integration, motivation, and focus. In order for the player to progress in the game, they must master the learning goals and objectives behind the game. The game should be integrated with learning goals. In the content that needs to be taught through the game, it should be made a point that in order to succeed in the game, is to know the information, which creates importance to the player. The game needs to be as motivating as possible and should pose a challenge. The primary activity of the game should be interacting and interesting to the students. Games are about decision making, where you see what the consequences are and what feedback you receive. Games teach students about rewards, but that it takes some work to receive those rewards. The actions within the game need to be relevant to life outside the game, so learning can occur. Focus can most successfully occur when one is learning by exploring, operating, or interacting. Teachers are using games more regularly that focus on a wide variety of objectives, while exposing students to more game genres and devices. There is much more structure, which makes it a lot easier for the teacher, and the students enjoy it. Students have become so fluent with the use of online tools. Learning data can be generated from the use of online games, which allow the teacher to have insight on the knowledge the children have obtained, and what needs improvement; this can then help a teacher with their curriculum and teaching. A student uses a Smart Board in class. A nationwide study of 488 K‚Äì12 teachers in the United States found that over half were using digital games in the classroom weekly. Most classrooms nowadays have replaced the traditional blackboard for the Smart Board, bringing technology into the classroom. As we move forward into the digital age, most schools provide lessons on computer literacy to ensure students are fluent when it comes to technology. Likewise, the use of well-designed educational video games delivers game based learning that can motivate students to participate more enthusiastically in subjects, including those that are often less popular. It is also noted that educational video games offer more interaction, immediate feedback, to both student and teacher, and more student control. Educational video games that involve aspects of reality, provide students with opportunities to be involved in an interactive environment that they would not ordinarily be allowed to participate in but from the safety of a classroom. =Subject focus= * History - while \\"News is the first cut of history\\" is often a reality, the New York Times decried \\"a void in young people's minds about anything that happened before today's headlines or newscasts\\" it promoted educational videos about history as \\"a new tool to make the past come to life.\\" * Biology - to understand more about Creationism and the Scopes trial, The New York Times recommends seeing \\"film clips of William Jennings Bryan confronting Clarence Darrow, the defense lawyer.\\" Special educational needs Children of all kinds thrive during play-based learning. Children with special needs, be it physical or cognitive, often require different materials to aide their education. Many schools strive for the inclusion of special educational needs students within the classroom and now, with the help of technology, schools begin to close the gap and give children with disabilities equal opportunities to learn and communicate. There have been many video games created within the past decades that specifically target special needs children, Dreamware being one. The device uses visual, auditory, temperature, and vibration sensory integration training which have been proven to capture the child's attention, keeping them focused for longer periods, allowing the child to learn more. Other educational video games targeted towards those with special education needs include virtual reality, as it can provide knowledge building experiences. One study conducted by Professor Standen of University of Nottingham concluded that adolescent students with severe intellectual disabilities who practiced shopping in a virtual supermarket were both quicker and more precise than those who had not. This showed that students could acquire important life skills through a video game and could then transfer that knowledge into the real environment, making them a valuable tool in education.  Importance to learners  Educational video games help learners in the development of reading comprehension and cognitive skills. For teachers, video games with educational value act as relevant material for engaging their students. Therefore, video games can be used as an immersive learning system that provides for a combination of digital technology, rich narrative, and real world gameplay. Through games students learn to exercise resilience, critical thinking, and problem solving skills by identifying numerous solutions for problems. By introducing them to educational video games, parents and teachers can make children interested in technology and technical skills from an early age. Educational video games are important for individualized learning. Given that every learner is different, teachers are always looking for adequate resources that will provide every learner with an individualized learning plan. Video games allow students to learn new concepts at their own pace without having a constant overlook from parents and teachers (Chang et al., 2009). The experiences of the players can be tailored based on their preferences and performance. The game is automatically adjusted to present higher-level challenges after solving each problem. If they are having difficulty with a concept, then the game is tailored to present the same concept in a different manner until the student understands it. Video games balance enjoyment with an appropriate challenge level, which keeps players in an optimally engaging and challenging learning zone. Research shows that children who play educational video games have improved visual-spatial skills. For instance, a simple game session can help learners visualize science topics in a way that helps them learn better. Children who play educational video games have sharpened visual attention skills and improved capacity to visualize 3D objects (Achtman et al. 2008). Furthermore, educational video games as they improve their aim and hand-eye coordination. The video game is a learning sector as activities that sharpen the perceptions of children as well as their responses to the world.  Limitations  One of the major limitations of educational video games is that they leave little room for spontaneous play. A child may be involved and have some degree of control in a game but ultimately cannot control the direction in which the game will go, hindering the notion of self-directed play as a means for learning. It has been noted that educational video games can help students focus; however, once the game has ended many find it hard to adapt back to the slower pace of receiving information in the classroom. It is also important for students to be able to ask questions on topics they do not fully understand. A supervising teacher may be able to aid the student whereas the computer cannot provide answers to all questions posed. Using educational computer games also relies on the teacher having prior knowledge of how the game works and be somewhat computer literate. Regardless of the enthusiasm surrounding video games and learning, very few studies have come to a conclusive answer as to whether educational video games improve academic achievement and classroom performance. Although individuals may develop game- specific abilities; these may not transfer into traditional academic skills required for learning. Only additional research could tell whether playing educational video games improves classroom behaviour and academic skills.

Most species are restricted to South America, but Imparfinis lineatus, Nemuroglanis panamensis and Pimelodella chagresi are native to Panama, and Rhamdia species occur as far north as Mexico. The name Heptapteridae is derived from Greek, hepta meaning seven and pteron meaning fin. The diversity of this family is poorly known, and many species are yet to be described. So far, some 211 species have been described. This family is equivalent to the previously recognized Rhamdiinae, a subfamily of the family Pimelodidae. However, molecular evidence shows this family is a part of the superfamily Pimelodoidea along with the Pimelodidae, Pseudopimelodidae, and Conorhynchos. The skin of these fish is usually naked (scaleless). They exhibit three pairs of barbels. They have a large adipose fin, and their caudal fin is deeply forked. However, no external characteristics unique to this family allow it to be differentiated from the Pimelodidae.

It was located at the site of modern Erice. Cyclopean masonry Mount Eryx The mountain,\\"Mons Eryx\\", Pliny iii. 8. s. 14; but \\"Mons Erycus\\", Cicero In Verrem ii. 4. 7; Tacitus Ann. iv. 43. now called Monte Erice, is a wholly isolated peak, rising in the midst of a low undulating tract, which causes its elevation to appear much more considerable than it really is, so that it was regarded in ancient as well as modern times as the most lofty summit in the whole island next to Aetna,Pol. i. 55; Pomponius Mela ii. 7. ¬ß 17; Gaius Julius Solinus 5. ¬ß 9. though its real elevation does not exceed 2184 English feet.William Henry Smyth, Sicily, p. 242. Hence we find Eryx alluded to by Virgil and other Latin poets as a mountain of the first order of magnitude, and associated with Athos, Aetna, etc.Virgil The Aeneid xii. 701; Val. Flacc. ii. 523. On its summit stood a celebrated temple of Venus or Aphrodite, founded, according to the current legend, by Aeneas,Strabo, xiii. p. 608: \\"... and others say that he landed at Aegesta in Sicily with Elymus the Trojan and took possession of Eryx and Lilybaeum, and gave the names Scamander and Simoeis to rivers near Aegesta, ...\\"; Virg. Aeneid v. 759. whence the goddess derived the surname of Venus Erycina, by which she is often mentioned by Latin writers.Horace Carm. i. 2. 33; Ovid, Heroid. 15. 57, etc. Legends Another legend, followed by Diodorus, ascribed the foundation both of the temple and city to an eponymous hero named Eryx, who was said to have received Hercules on his visit to this part of Sicily, and contended with that hero in a wrestling match, but was vanquished by him. This Eryx was a son of Aphrodite and Butes, a king of the country, and is hence repeatedly alluded to by Virgil as a brother of Aeneas, though that poet does not refer to him the foundation of the city.Diod. iv. 23, 83; Virgil Aeneid v. 24, 412, &c.; Servius ad loc. The legends which connected it with Aeneas and a Trojan chief named Elymus evidently pointed to what we learn from Thucydides as an historical fact, that Eryx as well as Segesta was a city of the Elymi, a Sicilian tribe, which is represented by almost all ancient writers as of Trojan descent.Thucydides vi. 2; Strabo xiii. p. 608. Yet another version was presented by Apollonius of Rhodes in his epic Argonautica. In this case, Butes was an Argonaut from Athens, who fell overboard in a rapture while listening to the Sirens. He was saved from drowning when Cypris (Aphrodite) took pity on him. She carried him to Eryx, where she ruled, and she settled him at Cape Lilybaeum.W. H. Race, Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica, Loeb Classical Library (2008), 4.912‚Äì919, p.402 History = Native settlement = It does not appear to have ever received a Greek colony but became gradually Hellenized, like most other cities of Sicily, to a great extent though Thucydides (460‚Äì395) still speaks of the Elymi, including the people of Eryx and Segesta, as barbarians. Nothing is known of its history previous to that period, but it seems probable that it followed for the most part the lead of the more powerful city of Segesta and, after the failure of the Athenian expedition, became a dependent ally of the Carthaginians. Cyclopean masonry or Phoenician walls, and the parts later modified or built by the Elymians, once hugged the border of Ericehttps://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phoenician-walls-of-erice. =Punic colony= In 406BC, a sea-fight took place between a Carthaginian and a Syracusan fleet off the neighborhood of Eryx, in which the latter was victorious.Diod. xiii. 80. On occasion of the great expedition of Dionysius I of Syracuse to the west of Sicily in 397BC, Eryx was one of the cities which joined the Syracusan despot just before the siege of Motya, but it was speedily recovered by Himilco in the following year.Id. xiv. 48, 55. It again fell into the hands of Dionysius shortly before his death,Id. xv. 73. but must have been once more recovered by the Carthaginians and probably continued subject to their rule until the expedition of Pyrrhus (278BC). On that occasion it was occupied by a strong garrison, which, combined with its natural strength of position, enabled it to oppose a vigorous resistance to the king of Epirus. It was, however, taken by assault, Pyrrhus himself leading the attack, and taking the opportunity to display his personal prowess as a worthy descendant of Heracles.Diod. xx. 10, Exc. H. p. 498. In the First Punic War (264‚Äì241 BC) we find Eryx again in the hands of the Carthaginians, and in 260BC their general Hamilcar destroyed the city, removing the inhabitants to the neighboring promontory of Drepanum, where he founded the town of that name.Id. xxiii. 9. The old site, however, seems not to have been wholly deserted, for a few years later we are told that the Roman consul L. Junius made himself master by surprise both of the temple and the city.Id. xxiv. 1; Pol. i. 55; Zonar. viii. 15. The former seems to have been well fortified, and, from its position on the summit of the mountain, constituted a military post of great strength. Hence probably it was that Hamilcar Barca, suddenly abandoning the singular position he had so long held on the mountain of Ercte, transferred his forces to Eryx, as being a still more impregnable stronghold. But though he surprised and made himself master of the town of Eryx, which was situated about halfway up the mountain, he was unable to reduce the temple and fortress on the summit, the Roman garrison of which was able to defy all his efforts. Meanwhile, Hamilcar maintained his position in the city, the remaining inhabitants of which he transferred to Drepanum; and though besieged or blockaded in his turn by a Roman army at the foot of the mountain, he preserved his communications with the sea, and was only compelled to abandon possession of Eryx and Drepanum when the great naval victory of G. Lutatius Catulus over the Carthaginians forced that people to sue for peace, 241BC.Pol. i. 58; Diod. xxiv. 8. p. 509; Livy xxi. 10, xxviii. 41. = Later history = From this time the town of Eryx sinks into insignificance, and it may even be doubted whether it was ever restored. Cicero (106‚Äì43 BC) alludes to the temple, but never notices the town; and Strabo speaks of it as in his day almost uninhabited. Pliny, indeed, enumerates the Erycini among the municipal communities of Sicily; but the circumstance mentioned by Tacitus, that it was the Segestans who applied to Tiberius for the restoration of the temple, would seem to indicate that the sanctuary was at that time dependent, in a municipal sense, on Segesta.Strabo VI-2, p. 272: \\"The last and longest side is not populous either, but still it is fairly well peopled; in fact, Alaesa, Tyndaris, the Emporium of the Aegestes, and Cephaloedis123 are all cities, and Panormus has also a Roman settlement. Aegestaea was founded, it is said, by those who crossed over with Philoctetes to the territory of Croton, as I have stated in my account of Italy; they were sent to Sicily by him along with Aegestes the Trojan\\"; Cicero, In Verrem ii. 8, 47; Pliny iii. 8. s. 14; Tacitus Ann. iv. 43.) No trace of the subsequent existence of the town of Eryx is found; the remaining inhabitants appear to have settled on the summit of the hill, where the modern town of Erice has grown up on the site of the temple. No remains of the ancient city are extant; but it appears to have occupied the site now marked by the convent of Santa Anna, about halfway down the mountain.William Henry Smyth, Sicily, p. 243.  Temple  Temple of Venus Erycina The temple, as already mentioned, was generally connected by popular legend with the Trojan settlements in this part of Sicily; if any value can be attached to these traditions, they would point to its being an ancient seat of Pelasgic worship, rather than of Phoenician origin, as supposed by many writers. Even those authors who represent it as founded before the time of Aeneas relate that it was visited by that hero, who adorned it with splendid offerings.Diod. iv. 83; Dionys. i. 53. It is certain that the sanctuary had the good fortune to be regarded with equal reverence by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. As early as the time of the Athenian expedition to Sicily (415 BC), we learn from Thucydides that it was rich in vessels and other offerings of gold and silver, of which the Segestans made use to delude the Athenian envoys into a belief of their wealth.Thucydides vi. 46. The Carthaginians appear to have identified the Venus Erycina with the Phoenician goddess Astarte, and hence showed her much reverence; while the Romans paid extraordinary honors both to the goddess and her temple, on account of their supposed connection with Aeneas. They were, indeed, unable to prevent their Gaulish mercenaries from plundering the temple at the time of its capture by Junius;Pol. ii. 7. but this appears to have been the only occasion on which it suffered, and its losses were quickly repaired, for Diodorus speaks of it as in a flourishing and wealthy condition. The Roman magistrates appointed to the government of Sicily never failed to pay a visit of honor to this celebrated sanctuary; a body of troops was appointed as a guard of honor to watch over it, and seventeen of the principal cities in Sicily were commanded to pay a yearly sum of gold for its adornment.Diod. iv. 83; Strabo v. p. 272; Cicero In Verrem ii. 8. Notwithstanding this, the decay of the city, and declining condition of this part of Sicily generally, appears to have caused the temple also to be neglected: hence in 25 the Segestans applied to Tiberius for its restoration, which that emperor, according to Tacitus, readily promised to undertake, but did not carry into effect, leaving it to Claudius to execute at a later period.Tacitus Ann. iv. 43; Suetonius Claud. 25. This is the latest mention of it that occurs in history; and the period of its final decay or destruction is unknown. By the 12th century, the site of the temple was occupied by a castle, converted into a prison; a small portion of the substructions, built of very large and massive stones is all that remains of the ancient edifice; but some fine granite columns, still existing in other parts of the town, have doubtless belonged originally to the temple. It has been already mentioned that the temple itself was surrounded by fortifications, so as to constitute a strong fortress or citadel, quite distinct from the city below: a coin struck by C. Considius Nonianus (in the 1st century BC) represents the temple itself, with this fortified peribolus, enclosing a considerable portion of the mountain on which it stands; but little dependence can be placed on the accuracy of the delineation. There was also a temple at Rome dedicated to Venus Erycina, which stood just outside the Colline Gate;Strabo v. p. 272. but the representation on the coin just cited is evidently that of the original Sicilian temple. The coins of the city of Eryx have types allusive to the worship of Venus, while others present a close analogy to those of Agrigentum (modern Agrigento), indicating a connection between the two cities, of which we find no explanation in history.Eckhel, vol. i. p. 208; Torremuzza, Num.

It synthesizes UDP-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate and UTP; i.e., : glucose-1-phosphate + UTP \\\\rightleftharpoons UDP-glucose + pyrophosphate UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is an enzyme found in all three domains (bacteria, eukarya, and archaea) as it is a key player in glycogenesis and cell wall synthesis. Its role in sugar metabolism has been studied extensively in plants in order to understand plant growth and increase agricultural production. Recently, human UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase has been studied and crystallized, revealing a different type of regulation than other organisms previously studied. Its significance is derived from the many uses of UDP-glucose including galactose metabolism, glycogen synthesis, glycoprotein synthesis, and glycolipid synthesis.  Structure  The structure of UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is significantly different between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but within eukaryotes, the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of the enzyme are quite conserved. In many species, UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is found as a homopolymer consisting of identical subunits in a symmetrical quaternary structure. The number of subunits varies across species: for instance, in Escherichia coli, the enzyme is found as a tetramer, whereas in Burkholderia xenovorans, the enzyme is dimeric. In humans and in yeast, the enzyme is active as an octamer consisting of two tetramers stacked onto one another with conserved hydrophobic residues at the interfaces between the subunits. In contrast, the enzyme in plants has conserved charged residues forming the interface between subunits. In humans, each enzyme subunit contains several residues (L113, N251, and N328) that are highly conserved in eukaryotes. A Rossman fold motif participates in binding of the UTP nucleotide and a sugar- binding domain (residues T286‚ÄìG293) coordinates with the glucose ring. A missense mutation (G115D) in the region of the enzyme containing the active site (which is conserved in eukaryotes) causes a dramatic decrease in enzymatic activity in vitro.

In plant leaves, UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is a key part of the sucrose biosynthesis pathway, supplying Uridine diphosphate glucose to Sucrose- phosphate synthase which converts UDP-glucose and D-fructose 6-phosphate into sucrose-6-phosphate. It may also be partially responsible for the breakdown of sucrose in other tissues using UDP-glucose. In higher animals, the enzyme is highly active in tissues involved in glycogenesis, including the liver and the muscles. An exception is the brain, which has high levels of glycogen but low specific activity of UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. In animal cells, UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is also required for galactose metabolism in animals and microorganisms. In galactose metabolism, the enzyme galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase transfers a phosphate from UDP-glucose to galactose 1-phosphate to produce UDP-galactose, which is then converted to UDP-glucose. Bacteria with defective UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase are unable to incorporate galactose into their cell walls. Mechanism In this enzyme‚Äôs primary reaction, the phosphate group on glucose-1-phosphate replaces the phosphoanhydride bond on UTP. This reaction is readily reversible and the Gibbs Free Energy is close to zero. However, under typical cellular conditions, inorganic pyrophosphatase quickly hydrolyzes the pyrophosphate product and drives the reaction forward by Le Chatelier's Principle. UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase uses an ordered sequential Bi Bi mechanism for both the forward and reverse reactions. In yeast, the enzyme follows simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and does not exhibit cooperativity between the subunits in the octamer. Similar to other sugar nucleotidyltransferases, UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity requires two divalent cations to stabilize the binding of negatively charged phosphate groups. Magnesium typically serves in this role, but other ions such as manganese(II), cobalt(II), and nickel(II) can also substitute with a ~75% reduction in the optimal activity. X-ray crystallography experiments have shown that one Mg2+ ion is coordinated by a phosphoryl oxygen on glucose 1-phosphate and by an Œ±-phosphoryl oxygen on UTP. In addition to stabilizing the negatively charged phosphates, Mg2+ is thought to orient the glucose 1-phosphate for nucleophilic attack of the Œ±-phosphorus of UTP. UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase reaction mechanism  Regulation  Although functionally similar across species, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has different structures and regulation mechanisms in different organisms. = Microorganisms = In yeast, UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is regulated by phosphorylation by PAS kinase. This phosphorylation is reversible and controls the partition of sugar flux towards glycogen and cell wall synthesis. =Plants= UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase in plants is regulated through oligomerization and possibly phosphorylation. In barley, it has been shown that UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is only active in monomeric form but readily forms oligomers, suggesting that oligomerization may be a form of regulation of the enzyme. In rice, cold stress decreases N-glycosylation of the enzyme, which is thought to alter the enzyme's activity in response to cold. In Arabidopsis, there are two isozymes of UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase: UGP1 and UGP2. These two isozymes have almost identical activities and differ in only 32 amino acids, all of which are located on the outer surface of the protein away from the active site. These minor differences may allow for differential allosteric regulation of isozyme activity. UGP1 and UGP2 are differentially expressed in different parts of the plant. UGP1 expression is widely expressed in the majority of tissues while UGP2 is expressed primarily in flowers, suggesting that UGP1 is the major form of the enzyme and UGP2 serves an auxiliary function. Indeed, UGP2 expression is increased in response to stressors such as phosphate deficiency, indicating that UGP2 probably functions as a backup to UGP1 when the plant is under environmental stress. = Animals = The control of UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity is primarily achieved by genetic means (i.e. regulation of transcription and translation). Similar to most enzymes, UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is inhibited by its product, UDP-glucose. However, the enzyme is not subject to significant allosteric regulation, which is logical given the widespread use of UDP- glucose in a variety of metabolic pathways. =Humans= In humans, UDP- glucose pyrophosphorylase is active as an octamer. The enzyme's activity is also modified by O-glycosylation. Similar to other mamallian species, there two different isoforms in humans that are produced by alternative splicing of the gene. The isoforms differ by only 11 amino acids at the N-terminus and no significant differences in their functional activity have been identified.  Disease relevance  In humans, galactosemia is a disorder that affects the development of newborns and children as they cannot metabolize the sugar galactose properly. It is speculated that overexpression of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase may relieve symptoms in humans with galactosemia. In cancer cells, which typically have high rates of glycolysis and decreased glycogen content, the activity of UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is often downregulated by up to 50-60% compared to normal cells. The abnormally low activity of UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is due to decreased levels of the enzyme and the downregulation of other enzymes in the glycogenic pathway including glycogen synthase and phosphoglucomutase. UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase has been found to be an important virulence factor in a variety of pathogens including bacteria and protozoa. For example, the enzyme has been found to be required for the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharide, an important virulence factor of streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial cause of pneumonia, bronchitis, and other breathing issues. As a result, the enzyme has attracted attention as a potential target for pharmaceuticals. However, in order to achieve specificity, the drugs must be designed to specifically target allosteric sites on the surface of the protein because the active site is highly conserved across species. UDP- glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP2) was recently found to be implicated in novel neurodevelopmental disorder in humans, known as also referred to as Barakat- Perenthaler syndrome. This disorder was first described in 22 individuals from 15 families, presenting with a severe epileptic encephalopathy, neurodevelopmental delay with absence of virtually all developmental milestones, intractable seizures, progressive microcephaly, visual disturbance and similar minor dysmorphisms. Barakat and colleagues identified a recurrent homozygous mutation in all affected individuals (chr2:64083454A > G), which mutates the translational start site of the shorter protein isoform of UGP2. Therefore, the shorter protein isoform can no longer be produced in patients harboring the homozygous mutation. Functional studies from the same group showed that the short protein isoform is normally predominantly expressed in human brain. Therefore, the recurrent mutation leads to a tissue-specific absence of UGP2 in brain, which leads to altered glycogen metabolism, upregulated unfolded protein response and premature neuronal differentiation. Other bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in UGP2 are likely lethal, as human embryonic stem cells depleted of both short and long isoforms of UGP2 fail to differentiate in cardiomyocytes and blood cells. Hence, the identification of this new disease also shows that isoform-specific start-loss mutations causing expression loss of a tissue-relevant isoform of an essential protein can cause a genetic disease, even when an organism-wide protein absence is incompatible with life. A therapy for Barakat-Perenthaler syndrome does currently not exist.

The typically small craft operated by the Section provided the RAAF with an air-sea rescue service, transported stores and provided support for seaplanes. History The RAAF's first boats were obtained in 1921 to support the Fairey III seaplanes based at RAAF Base Point Cook. The RAAF Maritime Section was massively expanded during World War II and at its peak the Section operated over 600 powered and 700 unpowered craft (including several sailing vessels). While many of these craft were ex- civilian fishing boats, the RAAF also purchased a number of specialised craft. Small maritime sections were established at many RAAF bases in Australia and the South West Pacific and were administered by the units they supported. Most training for RAAF crews was undertaken at RAAF Base Rathmines in New South Wales. Following the war, the RAAF Maritime Section was greatly reduced to operate only 65 powered and 42 unpowered craft. This force was reduced further when the RAAF retired its seaplanes in 1952 and as helicopters replaced air- sea rescue boats. The RAAF Maritime Section was disbanded on 31 January 1993.

Biography Cai Guo-Qiang was born in 1957 in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China. His father, Cai Ruiqin, was a calligrapher and traditional painter who worked in a bookstore. As a result, Cai Guo-Qiang was exposed early on to Western literature as well as traditional Chinese art forms. As an adolescent, Cai witnessed the social effects of the Cultural Revolution; he grew up in a setting where explosions were common, where ‚Äúgunpowder [was] used in both good ways and bad, in destruction and reconstruction‚Äù. Cai began painting in the early 1970s; his work turned away from the calligraphic and ink wash disciplines practiced by his father and towards the Western practice of oil and watercolor painting.Fei Dawei, ed., Cai Guo-Qiang, (London: Thames & Hudson and Paris: Fondation Cartier pour l‚Äôart contemporain, 2000), 122. Cai studied Scenic Design at the Shanghai Theatre Academy between 1982 and 1985. During that same time, he began to experiment with adding gunpowder into his painting compositions ‚Äúseeking to use the forces of nature to reduce my own control of the canvas.‚ÄùCai Guo-Qiang: My Stories of Painting, (Maastricht: Bonnefantenmuseum, 2016), 78. After moving to Japan in 1986, Cai spent years honing his signature use of gunpowder. Cai's first solo exhibition to gain significant global attention was Primeval Fireball (1991, P3 art and environment, Tokyo). For most audiences, it was an introduction to Cai's medium and method; an encompassing presentation of his intermingling of installation art, gunpowder drawing and conceptual performance. The exhibition was Cai's debut as a mature artist; the installation solidified his reputation as a ‚Äúgunpowder artist‚Äù and laid out his conceptual focus for the next decade by kickstarting his decade- long series Projects for Extraterrestrials.Cai Guo-Qiang: Hanging Out in the Museum, (Taipei: Taipei Fine Arts Museum, 2009), 278. Rather than literally, the term ‚ÄúExtraterrestrials‚Äù in this context is used as a challenge to adjust the vision of the world from a Ptolemaic fixation to an inclusive universal mentality - where humans are part of the cosmic landscape.Cai Guo Qiang, and P3 Art and environment. Kanesaka Rumiko, ed. Cai Guo-Qiang: Primeval Fireball. The Project for Projects, (Tokyo: P3 Art and environment, 1991), unpaginated. The most notable works in this series include: 45.5 Meteorite Craters Made by Humans on Their 45.5 Hundred Million Year Old Planet: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 3 (1990), Fetus Movement II: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 9 (1992), The Horizon from the Pan-Pacific: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 14 (1994), Project to Extend the Great Wall of China by 10,000 Meters: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 10 (1993), Restrained Violence‚ÄìRainbow: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 25 (1995), Dragon Sight Sees Vienna: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 32 (1999). In 1995, Cai was sponsored by a grant from the Asian Cultural Council to move to the United States, participate in a residency as part of the P.S.1 Studio Program. At P.S.1, he developed The Century with Mushroom Clouds: Project for the 20th Century (1996) and was short listed for The Hugo Boss Prize 1996 for his installation Cry Dragon/Cry Wolf: The Ark of Genghis Khan. He continued to exhibit internationally, participating in The Second and Third Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, at the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane (1996, 1999) and winning the Golden Lion at the 48th Venice Biennale in 1999 for Venice‚Äôs Rent Collection Courtyard. These successes lead to greater recognition in the United States, starting with the realization of How is Your Feng Shui? Year 2000 Project for Manhattan (2000) for the 2000 Whitney Biennial in which Cai offered feng shui remedies to visitors using an interactive computer program. In 2004, Cai Guo-Qiang: Inopportune at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) in North was awarded the Best Monograph Show and Best Installation in a Museum by the United States branch of the International Association of Art Critics.Thomas Krens, et al., Cai Guo-Qiang: I Want to Believe, (New York: Guggenheim Museum, 2008), 297. In 2005 he debuted his daytime explosion events with Black Rainbow: Explosion Project for Edinburgh and Black Rainbow: Explosion Project for Valencia (2005), for which he exploded a black smoke rainbow over each city. The combined achievement of the touring retrospective exhibition I Want to Believe (2008) at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and his appointment as the Director of Visual and Special Effects for the Beijing Olympic Games placed Cai in the spotlight of critical and popular attention. This key point in Cai's career established him as a global powerhouse for artistic production. That year he was also awarded the 7th Hiroshima Art Prize. Since then his many solo exhibitions and projects include Saraab (2011, Doha), 1040M Underground (2011, Ukraine), Da Vincis do Povo (2013, Brasilia, S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro), Falling Back to Earth (2013, Brisane), The Ninth Wave (2014, Shanghai), There and Back Again (2015, Yokohama), My Stories of Painting (2016, Maastricht), The Spirit of Painting (2017, Madrid), Flora Commedia (2018, Florence) and In the Volcano (2019, Naples). Cai is one of six artist-curators who made selections for Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection, on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum from May 24, 2019 through January 12, 2020. Artwork Cai Guo-Qiang's work crosses multiple mediums including drawing, installation, explosion event, and performance. Drawing upon Eastern philosophy and contemporary social issues as a conceptual basis, his artworks respond to culture and history and establish an exchange between viewers and the larger universe around them. His explosion art and installations are imbued with a force that transcends the two-dimensional plane to engage with society and nature. Cai's practice draws on a variety of symbols, narratives, traditions and materials including fengshui, Chinese medicine, shanshui paintings, science, flora and fauna, portraiture, and fireworks. Cai is among the first artists to contribute to discussions of Chinese art as a viable intellectual narrative with its own historical context and theoretical framework.Alexandra Munroe.

Spring, Summer & Winter: 259 x 648 > cm; Fall: 259 x 810 cm. Private Collection. Seasons of Life is Cai‚Äôs first gunpowder work to be created using color gunpowder and canvas in almost 30 years. The installation is composed of a series of 4 canvases, each dedicated to a season: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. The central motif was derived from shunga, erotic illustrations from the Japanese Edo period; pairs of men and women making love surrounded by seasonal plants and birds. Spring begins with cherry blossoms, winter jasmine, camellia and swallows; Summer is rich with iris, lily, peony and cuckoos; Fall turns to morning glory, chrysanthemum, pampas grass and geese; culminating in Winter‚Äôs plum blossoms, polyanthus, pine, cranes and whiteeyes. the Winter panel. From Spring to Winter, the pairs undergo a transformation from youth to age. Their bodies are decorated by tattoos derived from hanafuda, or Japanese playing cards, that mirror the surrounding plants and animals; glorifying the cyclical seasons of life.Cai Guo-Qiang, Eriko Osaka, Eriko Kimura, Hideko Numata, Naoaki Nakamura,Cai Guo-Qiang: There and Back Again, (Yokohama: Mochuisle, Inc., 2015), 38.

Created for the 2017 BBC series Civilisations (a re-envisioning of the 1969 program presented by Kenneth Clark), Heaven Complex depicts an idyllic garden filled with gigantic blooms of carnations, peonies and √ºber-pansies. The work consists of two phases: a color gunpowder ignition and a black gunpowder ignition. The first ignition created a vibrant scene that was then darkened by the second. During this second ignition, the colorful canvas was covered by a second set of canvases, to create a monochromatic abstract ‚Äùghost‚Äù of the garden.Flora Commedia: Cai Guo-Qiang at the Uffizi, (Florence: Giunti Editore S.p.A., 2018), 47-49.

For this explosion event, Cai ran 10,000 meters of fuse into the Gobi Desert, west of the Great Wall in Jiayuguan, Gansu Province. Small charges were placed every 3 meters and larger charges (60 kg each) were placed every 1,000 meters, mimicking the placement of ancient signal towers.Thomas Krens, et al., Cai Guo-Qiang: I Want to Believe, (New York: Guggenheim Museum, 2008), 142. The explosion event is the first example of Cai's ability to inspire and organize large numbers of volunteers to realize a monumental artwork. To offset costs, he worked with a Japanese travel agency to organize a group of Japanese tourists, who paid to attend the event and, along with local volunteers, helped lay the fuse lines.Orville Schell, Russell Storer and Cai Guo-Qiang, Cai Guo-Qiang: The Ninth Wave, (Shanghai: Artron Group, 2014), 163. The explosion event accompanied the solo exhibition Long Mai: The Dragon Meridian at P3 art and environment, Tokyo.

Dimensions variable. [Ephemeral] Cai's first major project after moving to the United States was The Century with Mushroom Clouds: Project for the 20th Century‚Äîa series of hand-held detonations executed in New York and Nevada. Cai deployed 10 grams of gunpowder in cardboard rolls to create mushroomoid smoke clouds at key points relating to the Manhattan project to re-enact and commemorate the atomic ignitions in the 20th Century. The ignitions were realized between February‚ÄìApril, 1996 at the Nuclear Test Site, Nevada; at Michael Heizer's Double Negative (1969‚Äì70), Mormon Mesa, Overton, Nevada; at Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty (1970) Salt Lake, Utah; and at various sites looking toward Manhattan, New York. The work was executed in anonymity and using guerrilla tactics; Cai did not obtain any official permission and was often forced to flee authorities to avoid explaining the performance. The constrained ignitions rival the ‚Äúextravagant, highly theatrical performances of expenditure‚ÄùMiwon Kwon, ‚ÄúThe Art of Expenditure,‚Äú in Cai Guo-Qiang: I Want to Believe, Alexandra Munroe (New York: Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 2008), 67. that characterize the spectacle of his other explosion events. The simple recycled material used to cobble together the miniature simulated atomic clouds are resourceful, low-budget and executed personally by Cai. For each ignition, Cai was accompanied by a photographer or videographer to preserve the action of these ephemeral events. The resulting photographs are among Cai's most recognizable works.Fei Dawei, ed., Cai Guo-Qiang, 131. ‚ÄúWhen I first arrived in the United States, I was practically unknown. I spent my time hiding from the police because, in the States, it is mandatory to get an authorisation from City Hall every time you work in a public place. When I organised the little explosions for this series of photographs, at any time they could have asked me to show proof of authorisation, which I didn't have, and given me trouble since I was using dangerous materials. So I had to do this work quietly. Now, these photographs have been exhibited, reproduced in numerous books and reviews, made into postcards, etc. Everyone said that the 20th century belonged to the United States. However, what is the most representative visual sign of the 20th century? The mushroom clouds. In the 19th century, they did not exist. In the 21st century, they will no longer exist since nuclear experiments will be done with computer simulations. And like everything that has become obsolete, they will become works of art.‚Äù Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cityscape Fireworks, 2001 > Realized at The Bund, Huangpu River, and Oriental Pearl TV tower, Shanghai, > October 20, 2001, 9:00 p.m., Approximately 20 minutes Fireworks (200,000 > shots of explosive). Explosion dimensions variable. Commissioned by the > Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [Ephemeral] On October 20, 2001, Cai realized the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cityscape Fireworks for the closing ceremonies of the APEC conference. Using 200,000 fireworks, 10 barges, 18 yachts, and 23 buildings along the Bund, the 20-minute pyrotechnic performance was unprecedented in scale and spectacle, not only in China but globally.Cai Guo-Qiang: I Want to Believe, 46. For his solo exhibition at the Shanghai Art Museum, Cai Guo-Qiang (2002), Cai created a series of 14 gunpowder drawings, Drawings for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, that commemorated the successful explosion events by capturing key moments from the display.

Commissioned by > The International Olympic Committee and The Beijing Organizing Committee for > the Games of the XXIX Olympiad [Ephemeral] As Director of Visual and Special Effects for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Cai designed the fireworks for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. These events included the iconic Five Olympic Rings, Lighting of the Olympic Cauldron and Footprints of History, in which 29 giant footprints appeared in the sky along the central axis of Beijing, to symbolize the 29 Olympiads.Cai Guo-Qiang: Hanging Out in the Museum, 109. This portion of the event fostered an immediate controversy, as to ensure the quality of the live broadcast, pre- shot footage that had been ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù using computer graphics was inserted.Yukie Kamita, et al., Cai Guo-Qiang: The 7th Hiroshima Art Prize, (Hiroshima: Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art, 2008), 42.

Commissioned by Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art [Ephemeral] Black Ceremony was a landmark daytime explosion event realized outside Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha on December 5, 2011. Using 8,300 PixelBurst (smoke shells fitted with computer chips), Cai constructed enormous shapes in the sky ‚Äì most notable a black pyramid and a seven-color rainbow. The work's theme was death; it was a spiritual funeral for those Arab people who had died far away from home.Deitch, Jeffrey, ed. Cai Guo-Qiang: Ladder to the Sky, (Munich, London, New York: DelMonico Books  Prestel, 2012), 180. Black Ceremony was a stylistic and technical departure from Cai's previous daytime explosion events. Previous events (Black Rainbow: Explosion Project for Edinburgh and Black Rainbow: Explosion Project for Valencia (2005) and Clear Sky Black Cloud (2006)) only used black smoke and traditional detonation. Black Ceremony not only included colored smoke, but the computer chip-based shells allowed for unprecedented precision in the creation of complex shapes. Sky Ladder, 2015 > Realized off Huiyu Island, Quanzhou, June 15, 4:45 am (dawn), 100 seconds. > Gunpowder, fuse and helium balloon, 500 x 5.5 m. [Ephemeral] After 21 years and 4 attempts, Sky Ladder was finally realized on June 15 off Huiyu Island, Quanzhou. Cai had previously attempted the explosion event in Bath (1994), Shanghai (2001), and Los Angeles (2012). The ladder was constructed from a flexible metal base in 5 x5 meter segments covered in strings of fireworks, suspended in the air with a helium balloon.Cai Guo- Qiang, Jeffrey Deitch, and Rebecca Morse. Cai Guo-Qiang: Ladder to the Sky. Los Angeles: Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, 2012), 8. The ladder ‚Äúallows [Cai] to have an eternal dialogue with the universe, so infinitely far, yet so close.‚ÄùCai Guo-Qiang, Jeffrey Deitch, and Rebecca Morse. Cai Guo- Qiang: Ladder to the Sky. Los Angeles: Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, 2012), 184. The execution of this 500-meter ladder was the subject of the Netflix documentary Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang, directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Kevin Macdonald. The documentary told the story of Cai's rise to global success through interviews with the artist, family, friends, colleagues, and critics.Gotthardt, Alexxa. \\"Explosives Artist Cai Guo-Qiang‚Äôs Story Comes to Netflix.\\" Artsy, Oct. 10, 2016. https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-explosives-artist-cai-guo-qiang- s-story-comes-to-netflix.

[Ephemeral] Using the blue skies of Florence as his canvas, Cai created an explosive tableau of Renaissance flowers on November 18, 2018. Inspired by Botticelli's Primavera, 50,000 custom-made fireworks released smoke to form thousands of flowers. The explosion lasted about 10 minutes on Piazzale Michelangelo overlooking the city. The spectacle introduced Cai's solo exhibition, Flora Commedia: Cai Quo-Qiang at the Uffizi. = Installations = Bringing to Venice What Marco Polo Forgot, 1995 > Realized at Palazzo Giustinian Lolin and Grand Canal.

Museo Navale di Venezia (fishing boat), > private collections (other components) For his first participation in the 46th Venice Biennale, Cai piloted a Quanzhou fishing boat from Piazza San Marco down the Canale Grande to the pier of the Palazzo. The work commemorated the 700th anniversary of Marco Polo's return to Venice from Quanzhou: ‚ÄúMarco Polo brought back to the West many new and rare things and interesting stories. But he did not bring back the important spirit, the Eastern view of the cosmos and of life. By using Chinese medicine as one of the symbols of this spirit, I will bring the things that Marco Polo could not.‚ÄùTransculture: 46th Venice Biennial, pp. 22-25, (Tokyo: The Japan Foundation; Fukutake Science and Culture Foundation, 1995), 102. The boat remained docked at the pier for the duration of the exhibition, while within the Palazzo's hall, five types of bottled herbal medicine were sold from a vending machine, each keyed to one of the five traditional Chinese elements of nature and life: water, wood, metal, fire, and earth. Notes on the wall from a specialist in Eastern medicine explained how each of the herbal mixes, with their five tastes (salty, sour, hot, bitter and sweet) related to the body's organs (kidney, liver, lung, heart and spleen).Cai Guo-Qiang: I Want to Believe, 235.

[Artwork Not Extant] Venice‚Äôs Rent Collection Courtyard (1999, Deposito Polveri, Arsenale, Venice) earned Cai the Golden Lion award at the 48th Venice Biennale and drew international critical attention and controversy for its reinterpretation of the 1965 Social Realist sculptural group Rent Collection Courtyard, executed by sculptors from the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts.Jonathan Napack, ‚ÄúChinese Artists May Sue Venice Biennale, 1999 Appropriation of a 1965 Socialist Realist Work Causes Anger.‚Äù The Art Newspaper (London) (Sept. 1, 2000): 3.

Ong ‚Äú‚ÄôWhat Marco Polo Forgot‚Äô Contemporary Chinese Art Reconfigures the Global,‚Äù Current Anthropology (Chicago) 53, no. 4 (Aug. 2012): 481. The figures were produced over several weeks preceding the exhibition opening, and completed during the ten days of the exhibition so that the opening audience would witness the sculptors at work. The gradual drying process of the unfired clay left the works first cracked then falling apart; the disintegration enhancing the experience of the figures who are both enacting and undergoing the violent destruction of oppression. Cai's recreation of the sculpture group was hailed as both a challenging and self-reflective examination of nationhood and as a base imitation of a highly regarded national icon.Jane Chin Davidson, ‚ÄúThe Body Archive: Chineseness at the Venice Biennale (1993-2005),‚Äù Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art 3, No. 1 & 2 (2016): 39-43.

Deutsche Bank > Collection Head On was first realized for the Deutsche Guggenheim exhibition Cai Guo- Qiang: Head On (2006, Berlin). Head On is not only one of Cai's most recognizable artworks, it is also his most exhibited. The installation consists of 99 life-sized replicas of wolves cyclically crashing into a glass wall. The wolves are constructed from papier-m√¢ch√©, plaster, fiberglass, resin, and painted hide. The height and thickness of the glass wall were copied from the measurements of the Berlin Wall. Its installation is accompanied by the video artwork Illusion II; a two-channel video installation that documents the explosion event realized for the same exhibition.Cai Guo- Qiang: I Want to Believe, 226. Head On presents a ‚Äúwall in the head‚Äù‚Äîits transparency making the wall more physically felt by the viewer.Jonathan Harris, ed., Identity Theft - The Cultural Colonization of Contemporary Art, (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2008), 215.

Collection of Queensland Art > Gallery, Brisbane During a site visit to the Queensland's North Stradbroke Island, Cai had a transcendent experience in which he had a vision of what would later be developed into the installation Heritage. Heritage is an installation consisting of 99 life-size replicas of animals from all continents and climates standing in white sand haphazardly around a clear pool of water. The animals gathered around Heritage emulate the diverse cultures and races present on earth. Each lifelike animal was sculpted out of Styrofoam and covered in animal pelts with glass eyes and sculpted tongues. At the centre of the pool, a mechanism releases a drop of water into the pool.Cai Guo-Qiang, et. al., Cai Guo-Qiang: Falling Back to Earth, (South Brisbane: Queensland Art Gallery, 2014). = Social Projects = Man, Eagle and Eye in the Sky, 2003. > Realized at Siwa Oasis, Egyptian Sahara desert.

In November 2003, Cai realized the performance event Man, Eagle and Eye in the Sky in the Siwa Oasis, Egyptian Sahara desert. In collaboration with over 600 schoolchildren from 40 schools, they painted and flew 300 silk and bamboo handmade kites shaped as men, eagles and eyes. Later that year, Cai executed a series of 12 gunpowder on paper drawings, mounted on wooden panels as screens, that played on these motifs and the theme of flying kites. These gunpowder drawings were among Cai's first representative gunpowder drawings that explored the use of light and shade through the capturing of smoke with glassine paper.Sharmini Pereira, ed.

Commissioned by Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennial 2000, Niigata Prefecture. DMoCA is the first in Cai's Everything is Museum series that establishes museums in unusual or deserted places. For the first iteration, a 'dragon' kiln was relocated from Dehua, China to Niigata, Japan for the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennial 2000. For each following Triennial, Cai has invited a contemporary artist to construct an artwork using the DMoCA kiln as a site- specific inspiration: Kiki Smith, Pause (2003); K≈çtar≈ç Miyanaga, Range (2006); Jennifer Wen Ma, You Can‚Äôt always See Where You are Going, But Can You See Where You‚Äôve Been (2009); Ann Hamilton, air for everyone (2012); Thrown Rope for Japan, Peter Hutchinson (2015); Wang Sishun, Flower of Happiness (2018). Peasant da Vincis, 2013 - Cai's curated project Cai Guo-Qiang: Peasant da Vincis is a series of exhibitions that feature the work of Chinese peasant inventors: artisanal aircraft, submarines, and robots. The product of over a decade of research, the exhibition showcases the peasants‚Äô courage and individual creativity, by exploring their contributions to China's urbanization and modernity. In 2013, the exhibition toured throughout Brazil, showing in Bras√≠lia, S√£o Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro; it was the most visited contemporary art exhibition by a living artist that year.Cai Guo-Qiang: My Stories of Painting, (Maastricht: Bonnefantenmuseum, 2016), 164. In 2015, Peasant da Vincis travelled to Milan's National Museum of Science and Technology Leonardo da Vinci, home to many of Leonardo da Vinci's inventions. Its corresponding children's program Children da Vincis (in which children create their own inventions from everyday recyclable objects) was highlighted in Parasophia: Kyoto International Festival of Contemporary Culture, where a nine-story bamboo pagoda, decorated with hundreds of the children's creations, was erected inside the Kyoto Municipal Museum.

In the mid-2010s, he made his gunpowder paintings in a Long Island fireworks factory. His Manhattan studio was renovated by Shohei Shigematsu and OMA. Guo-Qiang intends for it to eventually become a foundation with public viewing. He sought a property, unlike his prior studios, where he would both work and live with his family, fulfilling a goal to combine his personal and professional lives. Guo-Qiang purchased a former horse farm in Chester, New Jersey, in 2011 from an Olympic equestrian. The property was redesigned by architect Frank Gehry and his former student Trattie Davies. They converted the barn into a 14,000-square- foot studio, the stables into archives, and its hayloft into an exhibition space. Guo-Qiang had met Gehry in 2009 at Guo-Qiang's Guggenheim Bilbao solo show, and their friendship included a 2013 trip to Guo-Qiang's hometown of Quanzhou to propose a contemporary art museum. The two began work on Guo- Qiang's Chester property soon after he purchased it. The 9,700-square-foot house is built outward from the original, stone core structure in glass and sequoia. At Guo-Qiang's request, the titanium roofing curls at their edges, like flying carpets. The house has multiple small balconies. The artist lives in the Chester house with his wife and two daughters.

He played for the University of North Carolina from 1967 to 1970 where he played as a point guard on two NCAA Final Four teams. Fogler was an All-City guard at Flushing High School in Flushing, New York. Background ‚ÄúI was a pretty good high school player growing up and did pretty well,‚Äù said Fogler. ‚ÄúNorth Carolina always had a tradition of looking in New York for players from Coach (Frank) McGuire who passed that down to Coach Smith. ‚ÄúI went to a summer camp in North Carolina before my senior year. I loved it and they felt I might be good enough to help their program. It worked out for me to become a student-athlete at Chapel Hill in 1966-1970. We played freshman ball and my freshman coach was Larry Brown.‚Äù As a junior, Fogler was a solid starter at guard and the Tar Heels reached the Final Four again as ACC Champions and ACC Tournament champions finishing with a 27‚Äì5 record. North Carolina lost in a semifinals game to Purdue (92‚Äì65) who was led by All-American Rick Mount.Eddie Fogler recalls his career, Commodore History Corner Archive January 12, 2011 After graduating from UNC with a degree in Mathematics, Fogler spent the next year teaching and coaching at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, under prep legend Morgan Wootten. After one year in Hyattsville, Fogler would return to Chapel Hill as a graduate assistant for two seasons under Smith. He would spend 15 years as a Tar Heel assistant where the university won eight ACC Championships, five ACC Tournament Titles and made the Final Four four times with a national title in 1982 over Georgetown. Coaching for his mentor Smith was an experience of a lifetime for a young college coach. Fogler served as an assistant college basketball coach at UNC and then served as the head basketball coach at Wichita State University, Vanderbilt University, and University of South Carolina. From 1986 to 1989, he served as head coach at Wichita State University where he compiled a 61‚Äì32 (.656) record which included two NCAA Tournament appearances and one NIT berth for the Shockers. From 1989 to 1994, Fogler served as the head coach at Vanderbilt where his Commodores compiled an 81‚Äì48 record. His 1989‚Äì90 team captured the NIT Championship with a 74‚Äì72 victory over St. Louis University. His 1992‚Äì93 team was ranked as high as #5 in the country and finished 28-6, including a 14‚Äì2 record in the SEC, a trip to the NCAA Tournament's \\"Sweet Sixteen\\", and he was named National Coach of the Year after winning the SEC championship. In the four years that he coached Vanderbilt, the Commodores achieved two NIT berths and two NCAA Tournament bids. Fogler's move from Vanderbilt to South Carolina, following the success of the team's 1992‚Äì93 season, left many Vanderbilt fans embittered toward the school's Athletic Director, Paul Hoolahan, and his handling of the matter.The Enemy Within, The Nashville Scene, October 12, 1995 From 1994 to 2001, Fogler coached at South Carolina. He coached the Gamecocks to two NCAA Tournament appearances. His best team was the 1996-97 unit, which went 15-1 in conference play to win the school's only outright Southeastern Conference title, while finishing sixth in the final AP Poll‚Äîthe highest final ranking in school history. That team, however, was upset by Coppin State in the first round. The Gamecocks were seeded second in the East Regional, their highest-ever seeding in an NCAA Tournament; their defeat at the hands of Coppin State was only the third time a #2 seed had lost in the first round. The following year, the Gamecocks battled back for 23 wins and a 3-seed in the NCAA tournament, but fell again in the first round to 14th-seeded Richmond by a point. South Carolina did not achieve another winning record during his tenure, and he retired after the 2000-01 season, having compiled a 123‚Äì117 (.513) overall record at South Carolina in 8 seasons. Commenting after his final game as a head coach, Fogler stated \\"It is very difficult with college athletics being the way it is today and the pressures. You are darned if you do, darned if you don't,\\" Fogler said. \\"I'm leaving college basketball with my dignity, my integrity and my sanity.\\" Fogler now serves as an analyst for Fox Sports Network, guest hosts a one-hour, weekly, NCAA Basketball show on WGFX \\"104.5 FM The Zone\\" (sports talk) in Nashville, Tennessee, serves as an advisor to schools seeking new basketball coaches,Fogler's history of helping find coaches, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 17, 2011 and resides in Elgin, South Carolina with his wife, Robin, daughter, Emma, and son, Ben.

It is the third largest port system in Vietnam (after Saigon Port in H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City and the port of H·∫£i Ph√≤ng). ƒê√† N·∫µng Port lies at one end of the East‚ÄìWest Economic Corridor, an economic corridor connecting Vietnam with Laos, Thailand, and Burma. Vietnam National Shipping Lines (Vinalines) is the port's authority. In 2008, ƒê√† N·∫µng Port handled 2.7 million tons of cargo, of which 1.2 million tons were exports, 525,900 tons were imports, and 985,600 tons were domestic cargo. Over 29,600 passengers passed through the port in 2008, a significant increase over previous years. Despite the fact that the port's infrastructure is not specifically designed to accommodate cruise ships, the number of large cruise ships docking at ƒê√† N·∫µng Port has increased in recent years.Da Nang Port: more tourists, more worries In the first two months of 2010 alone, 12 cruise ships docked in ƒê√† N·∫µng, carrying 6,477 passengers. History French ships attack ƒê√† N·∫µng Port in 1858. ƒê√† N·∫µng has been a port city for many centuries, long before the first arrival of European traders in the 16th century. One of the first Europeans to visit the city was Portuguese explorer Antonio De Faria, who anchored at ƒê√† N·∫µng Port in 1535. De Faria was one of the first Westerners to write about the area, and through his influence Portuguese ships began to call regularly at H·ªôi An, which was then a far more important port than ƒê√† N·∫µng.History of H·ªôi An, a World Heritage Site Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, French and Spanish traders and missionaries regularly made landfall at H·ªôi An, just south of ƒê√† N·∫µng. In 1787, Emperor Gia Long concluded a treaty with King Louis XVI, whereby he ceded ƒê√† N·∫µng Port to the French in return for promised military aid. Following the edict of Emperor Minh M·∫°ng in 1835 prohibiting European vessels from making landfall or pursuing trade except at ƒê√† N·∫µng, its port quickly superseded H·ªôi An as the largest commercial port in the central region. In 1847, French vessels dispatched by Admiral C√©cille bombarded ƒê√† N·∫µng, ostensibly on the grounds of persecution of Roman Catholic missionaries by Emperor Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã. In August 1858, again ostensibly on grounds of alleged persecution of Catholic missionaries‚Äîthis time by Emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c‚ÄîFrench troops led by Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly seized ƒê√† N·∫µng Port as part of the punitive Cochinchina Campaign. The French overpowered the Vietnamese stationed in ƒê√† N·∫µng, swiftly occupying the city and Ti√™n Sa Peninsula (now called S∆°n Tr√† Peninsula). ƒê√† N·∫µng (which the French called Tourane) and its port would remain in French hands until 1954, upon the formal dissolution of French Indochina in the 1950s. Facilities Vietnamese military officials watch as the moors at ƒê√† N·∫µng Port. ƒê√† N·∫µng Port consists of two main terminals (Ti√™n Sa Seaport and Song H√†n Terminal) and an additional freight warehouse, Tho Quang Station. The total area of the port system is , of which is warehouse space and is yard space. In recent years, the number of large cruise ships docking at ƒê√† N·∫µng Port has increased, despite the fact that its infrastructure is not specifically designed to accommodate cruise ships.ƒê√† N·∫µng: more tourists, more worries Due to these limitations, cruise ships generally make short stays‚Äîabout 2 or 3 days at most. In the first two months of 2010, 12 cruise ships were reported to have docked at ƒê√† N·∫µng Port, carrying 6,477 tourists, mainly from Europe, the U.S., Canada and Australia. =Ti√™n Sa Seaport= Boats docked at Song H√†n Terminal.

Swords and similar weapons were banned from most people during this time which created a desire for weapons that could be held in plain sight without arousing suspicion. They became most popular among the chungin (middle class) and yang-ban (upper class). Craftsmen discovered a way of taking the \\"pak dahl\\" wood, an extremely resilient birch tree that thrived in the ice storms and harsh seasons of Korea's mountainous peninsula, and tempering it to a hardness that could resist the edged weapons typical of the era. Variations Following traditions of traditional weaponry, Korean war fans were often unique to their wielder and bore many possible combinations. Some wove flexible metal ribbons along the outer most edge for cutting power or preferred feathers that hid finger-sized razor blades which would rake upon striking. Others held variations of poisons or were used to conceal other weapons such as throwing blades which could be released in a spread upon snapping the fan open, a technique a few Kook Sool Won (Guksulwon) artists are said to practice. Poison fans often hid deadly or stunning concoctions in bladders or channels which would open upon spreading the fan, allowing the user to gently direct a gust of irritants and toxins at their opponent over short distances. Folklore and hearsay also suggests occasional traveling merchants trading with China possessed fans with small compartments in the vanes of the fan which held small explosive pellets that upon striking a surface would create a bright and dazzling flash of light, similar in concept to modern Chinese novelty fireworks.

The hotel was opened to the public on Christmas Eve 1959, when the city was known as Saigon. Contemporary journalists noted its use of Italian marble, bullet-proof glass and a ‚Äústate-of-the-art air-conditioning system and a Berliet private generator.‚Äù The hotel‚Äôs modern design was the work of a Vietnamese architect, Mr. Nguyen Van Hoa, a graduate of √âcole Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Hanoi. (Ref: \\"Caravelle-Saigon, A History\\" by VHSG, Saigon Culture Publishing House, 2009) The original ten-story building is now adjoined to a 24-story tower that forms the bulk of the new property. However, the Saigon Saigon Rooftop Bar has changed little since 1959. Caravelle Hotel is owned by the state-owned Saigon Tourist Co. History During the 1960s, the Caravelle was home to the Australian Embassy, the New Zealand Embassy, and the Saigon bureaus of NBC, ABC and CBS. As a hub of communication, it played an important role in the Vietnam War. The Manifesto of the Eighteen became better known as the Caravelle Manifesto after a press conference to announce it was held at the hotel. It also became part of Vietnam fiction and non- fiction literature, such as in Danielle Steele's novel \\"Message From Nam\\" and Morley Safer's memoir \\"Flashbacks\\". On the morning of August 25, 1964, at around 11:30 am, a bomb exploded in room 514, on a floor occupied mostly by foreign journalists, who were all out on assignment. Nine rooms were damaged, windows were blown out of several cars parked in the street, and a number of people were injured without fatalities. The Australian Embassy was protected by Australian Army soldiers. As part of the draw-down of Australian forces in the country, these became the independent Australian Embassy Guard Platoon, Saigon which was stationed at the Caravelle Hotel from March 1972 until June 1973. Following the fall of Saigon in 1975, the hotel was taken over and operated by the government and renamed the Doc Lap (Independence) Hotel. This name remained until 1998, when the Caravelle name was relaunched following refurbishment. When director Phillip Noyce in 2002 surveyed Lam Son Square as a movie set for the dramatic bombing scene in Graham Greene‚Äôs The Quiet American, he chose the Caravelle as a stand-in for the historic Continental Hotel across the square. It was not that the Caravelle looked anything like the Continental, but the renovations at the Continental and the cost of shooting scenes at the hotel ruled out the original as an option. As the ground floor of the Caravelle donned stage makeup and a new persona for its acting debut, actors in the movie moved into the Presidential Suites upstairs. Hotel staff remember the actor Michael Caine, who won an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Thomas Fowler, as an extremely amiable character. Caine would take tea in the bar, chit chat with the restaurant staff, and after discovering that the hotel buffet included roast beef and Yorkshire puddings, became a regular fixture at the restaurant.

He was most widely known for developing the Foxfire Project, a writing project that led to a magazine and the series of best-selling Foxfire books, twelve volumes in all. These were based on articles by high school students from Rabun County, Georgia. In 1986 he was named \\"Georgia Teacher of the Year\\" and in 1989 he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. Background Brooks Eliot Wigginton was born in West Virginia on November 9, 1942. His mother, Lucy Freelove Smith Wigginton, died eleven days later of \\"pneunomia due to acute pulmonary edema,\\" according to her death certificate. His maternal grandmother, Margaret Pollard Smith, was an associate professor of English at Vassar College and his father was a famous landscape architect, named Brooks Edward Wigginton. His family called him Eliot. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in English from Cornell University and a second Master's from Johns Hopkins University. In 1966, he began teaching English in the Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School, located in the Appalachian Mountains of northeastern Georgia. Foxfire Work Wigginton began a writing project based on his students' collecting oral histories from local residents and writing them up. They published the histories and articles in a small magazine format beginning in 1966. Topics included all manner of folklife practices and customs associated with farming and the rural life of southern Appalachia, as well as the folklore and oral history of local residents. The magazine began to reach a national audience and became quite popular. The first anthology of collected Foxfire articles was published in book form in 1972, and achieved best-seller status. Over the years, the schools published eleven other volumes. (The project transferred to the local public school in 1977.) In addition, special collections were published, including The Foxfire Book of Appalachian Cookery, Foxfire: 25 Years, A Foxfire Christmas, and The Foxfire Book of Appalachian Toys and Games. Several collections of recorded music from the local area were released. Wigginton also had an interest in activists' working for social change in association with the Highlander Folk School. After a decade of collecting oral histories of people struggling for social justice in the South, Wigginton edited and published, Refuse to Stand Silently By: An Oral History of Grass Roots Social Activism in America, 1921-1964 (Doubleday, 1991). Guilty plea In 1992, Wigginton pleaded guilty to one count of non- aggravated child molestation of a 10-year-old boy. He received a one-year jail sentence, and 19 years of probation. Required to leave the Foxfire project, he moved to Florida, where he is required to register as a sex offender.Eliot Wigginton, Florida Registered Sexual Offenders, accessed 11 Nov 2010 Foxfire continues Since then, the Foxfire project has continued under the auspices of the Foxfire Fund and its developed model of the \\"Foxfire approach\\" to experiential education. The students and Fund developed a museum in Mountain City, Georgia, consisting of several cabins. They also began archiving their materials and have been aided by the University of Georgia. In 1998 the University of Georgia anthropology department started to work with the Foxfire project to archive 30 years worth of materials. The collection is held at the museum and includes \\"2,000 hours of interviews on audio tape, 30,000 black and white pictures and hundreds of hours of videotape.\\" By improving how the material is archived and establishing a database, the university believes the materials can be made more easily available for scholars.\\"University of Georgia To Help Archive, Preserve Thirty Years Of Materials From Foxfire Project\\", University of Georgia Archives, 1998, accessed 12 Nov 2010 The Foxfire educational philosophy is based on the values of \\"a learner-centered, community-based expression.\\" In popular culture *Hume Cronyn and Susan Cooper developed a play based on this work, also entitled Foxfire (1982).

He is the founder of Wolf Pack Management and is involved in a number of research projects in Poland and at Yellowstone National Park in the United States. He has worked with wolves since 1990, and before that he studied the red fox in the UK, and then coyote in Canada. Early life Brought up deep in the countryside in the small village of Great Massingham, which is near King's Lynn Norfolk, he began observing wild animals at a young age, learning to use his sense of smell and sound to find his way at night when studying foxes and badgers. Ellis first trained to be a gamekeeper, but left the job when the Head gamekeeper found out that Ellis was feeding rather than culling foxes. He then joined and served with the Royal Marines. After he left the Marines he contacted a Native American biologist, Levi Holt, and from their meeting he was able to spend several months living at the Wolf Education and Research Center on Nez Perce tribal lands in northern Idaho, United States as a volunteer in a project studying wolves at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. They taught him how to observe wolves, and he was able to get into a pack of wolves and live among them. He recorded wild wolf howls and gradually learned to identify individual pack members and began to realise that wolves are highly intelligent and instinctive individuals that show trust and balance within their pack's social structure. Career He was the founder and head of Wolf Pack Management at Combe Martin Wildlife Park in North Devon where he worked with 17 captive wolves, which included four pups born on 19 May 2008. There were originally six wolves at the park which he rescued from private ownership. He also used to regularly give educational talks about wolves. In 2005 Ellis spent 18 months living in captivity at Combe Martin Wildlife Park with three abandoned wolf pups - Yana, Tamaska and Matsi, educating them to be wild wolves and becoming the pack's alpha male. Ellis also claims, in The Man Who Lives with Wolves, to have spent two years living as a member of a wild wolf pack in Idaho - although this claim does not appear to have peer-reviewed support. He told a reporter for The Guardian, \\"I ate what they ate, mostly raw deer and elk, which they would often bring back for me, or fruit and berries. I never fell ill and my body adapted quickly to its new diet.\\" Despite the food being generally unappealing, Ellis commented that, when you're hungry enough, even raw meat begins to look appetizing. Ellis has spent much of his adult life studying and living with wolves and has learned to communicate with them through scent and sound. He used to live directly outside the wolf enclosure at Combe Martin Wildlife Park, so that he could be in close proximity to the wolves at all times. The research projects Ellis is involved with in Poland and Yellowstone National Park in the United States have the goal of developing humane methods to discourage wolves from entering areas of potential conflict with humans. Ellis has stated that he would like to see wild wolves eventually reintroduced into England, where they last lived in the 17th century when the last wolves were killed (see Wolves in the British Isles). Ellis has said about wolves, \\"Although many people refer to wolves as savage killers, I‚Äôve come to know and love them as family.\\" During the summer of 2011 Ellis relocated along with his wolves and his new wife, conservation biologist Dr Isla Fishburn, to \\"The Wolf Centre\\". The centre was located at the seaside end of Combe Martin at Newberry Farm, Woodlands. It provided Ellis with his own dedicated base of operations from which to continue his work with the wolves. The Wolf Centre was not open to the general public, however it did offer a range of experiences and encounters to the public, including meet and greet sessions with Ellis and his wolf hybrids, and courses covering dog behaviour, instruction and training. Following complaints about noise, safety and traffic, Ellis's planning application at Combe Martin was withdrawn in 2013 and Ellis moved to Cornwall, where he set up the Wolf and Dog Development Centre in Truro.Official site of The Wolf and Dog Development Centre Books Ellis has written five books about wolves: The Wolf Talk (2003), Spirit of the Wolf (2006), The Man Who Lives with Wolves (with Penny Junor, 2009) Living With Wolves (2010) and The Wolf Within: How I Learned To Talk Dog (2011). In 2004 BBC South West nominated Ellis as a \\"Local Champion\\" in South West England, a campaign that aims to highlight the work of people who are not always publicly recognised. He was featured on BBC Radio 4 on 2 May 2005 in a programme A Life with Wolves. The character of \\"Luke Warren in the book, 'The Lone Wolf' by Jodi Picoult was loosely based on Shaun, Jodi did extensive research on Shaun while researching her book. Television appearances =The Wolfman= Ellis was the subject of a documentary, The Wolfman which first aired on Five in the UK as The Wolfman on 18 May 2007, and has also been shown on the National Geographic Channel in the United States, where it was titled A Man Among Wolves. The documentary shows how, by carefully mimicking wolf behaviour, Ellis was able to raise the three wolf cubs to maturity. It also shows how his expertise brought him to the attention of a Polish farmer, whose livestock had suffered wolf attacks. Since wolves are a protected species in Poland the farmer hoped that Ellis might be able to find some non- violent way to deter the marauding pack. Ellis travelled to Poland to study the local pack, bringing with him audio recordings of wolf howls. Ellis believed that if the local wolves heard howls coming from the farm they would believe another pack had already claimed it as their territory, and keep clear to avoid a conflict. In order for this to work Ellis had to determine the size of the pack and play back recordings of a similar-sized pack. Initial results were encouraging and in the first few weeks after the farmer began playing the recordings the farm suffered no further attacks. The documentary then shows Ellis returning to Devon, where he attempted to reintegrate himself with the three wolves. In his absence the wolves had established a new hierarchy, and though they recognised Ellis and welcomed him back he was now the pack's omega, relegated to a peace-keeping role between the new alpha and beta males. =Martin Clunes: A Man and His Dogs= Ellis featured in the first episode of Martin Clunes: A Man and His Dogs, a two-part documentary that aired on ITV on 24 August 2008 in which Clunes explores the canine world, and visited Ellis in Devon as part of an attempt to discover what binds wolves with pet dogs, with Ellis revealing that a lot of dog behaviour which is interpreted as human, is inherited from the wolf's hierarchical pack instincts. Filmed in January 2008, Clunes joined Ellis with the pack at Combe Martin. =Living With the Wolfman= Living with the Wolfman is an eight-part documentary about Ellis which aired in the United States on Animal Planet in October and November 2008. It is also due to be shown in the UK on Five. The documentary follows Ellis as he lives with the wolf pack at Combe Martin and his relationship with his partner, Helen and their life in Devon. It also shows how Ellis integrated his girlfriend into the pack. =Mr and Mrs Wolf= In February 2009, Five screened a follow-up two-part documentary, Mr and Mrs Wolf which focused on his attempts to get partner Helen Jeffs adopted as a member by the wolf pack at Combe Martin, as a new \\"wolf nanny\\" for the pregnant alpha female, Cheyenne. The programme aired on 17 and 24 February. =Stan Lee's Superhuman= He has also appeared on the US History Channels show Stan Lee's Superhuman, which documents real-life superheroes from around the world. =The Lion Man: One World African Safari= In fifth episode of the first season of TV show The Lion Man: African Safari, Craig Busch, an experienced self-taught \\"wild cat trainer\\" pays a visit to Shaun Ellis. Criticism Ellis, along with his program Man among Wolves, has been criticized by the International Wolf Center for perceived sensationalism. Nancy Gibson, a wolf biologist who'd studied under L. David Mech, wrote the following in regards to Ellis's methods: Criticism was also leveled at his attempts to teach wolves how to howl and hunt, which Gibson asserted comes naturally to them.Nancy Gibson, \\"Sensational Geographic\\", International Wolf, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Spring 2008). David Mech himself stated \\"Mr. Ellis is neither a scientist nor an expert on the natural behavior of wolves.\\"King, B.J. (19 April 2012). \\"Why Are Wolf Scientists Howling at Jodi Picoult?\\" NPR. Denise Taylor, the executive director of the UK Wolf Conservation Trust, dismissed Ellis's methodology as part of \\"the macho-driven pursuits of the seemingly burgeoning number of TV presenters who think it is acceptable to drag what are perceived to be scary and highly dangerous creatures from their habitats, and wrestle with them and dominate them\\".Denise Taylor (summer 2007), \\"Humans are not wolves!\\", WolfPrint, issue 31 Bibliography  * References External links * Official site of The Wolf and Dog Development Centre Category:Ethologists Category:Living people Category:1964 births ","title":"Shaun Ellis (wolf researcher)"},{"id":"10527720","text":"Angoville may refer to the following: *Angoville, Calvados, a commune in the Calvados d√©partement *Angoville-au-Plain, a commune in the Manche d√©partement *Angoville-en-Saire, a commune until 1973 when it became a part of Cosqueville *Angoville-sur-Ay, a commune in the Manche d√©partement ","title":"Angoville"},{"id":"10527730","text":"ƒê·ªìng Sƒ© Nguy√™n, also spelled ƒê·ªìng S·ªπ Nguy√™n, other name Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu V≈©T∆∞·ªõng ƒê·ªìng Sƒ© Nguy√™n v·ªõi Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n huy·ªÅn tho·∫°i, B√°o C√¥ng an ƒê√† N·∫µng (1 March 1923 ‚Äì 4 April 2019Former Vice-Chairman of Council of Ministers Dong Sy Yuan ‚Äì Vietnamnet.vn died), was a Vietnamese soldier and politician.

He was born in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province, home to general V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p and Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, president of the Republic of Vietnam. Biography Born on March 1, 1923 to a middle-class family in Quang Trung Commune, Qu·∫£ng Tr·∫°ch District, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province, Dong Sy Nguyen attended Sainte Marie Lyc√©e in ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi. He participated in anti-French political movements and was sought by the French colonists; therefore he fled to Thailand and participated in overseas Vietnamese patriotic movements there. He joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1939. In 1944, he secretly returned to Vietnam and was made leader of the Communist Party committee branch in Quang Trach Phu, served as editor-in-chief of the Hong Lac Newspaper, built up the Trung Thuan Military Zone, trained the armed forces, and participated in the August Revolution. After the August Revolution, he was nominated as the leader of the Viet Minh in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province. He was a member of the first session of the National Assembly of Vietnam. Joining the army When the First Indochinese War broke out, ƒê·ªìng Sƒ© Nguy√™n was assigned the leader of Viet Minh's army in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province and the provincial army's communist party committee member. In 1950, he was sent to Vi·ªát B·∫Øc to attend an advanced level army class, then he was sent to the Bureau General of Politics of Vietnamese Army to act as an envoy in Command wing in Lower Laos in Winter- Spring Campaign of 1953-1954. In 1954, he was dispatched to the General Staff of North Vietnamese Army, in charge of Civilian Forces Mobilization Department. In 1959, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. In 1961, he was sent to China to attend Beijing Advanced Military School. In 1964, he came back to North Vietnam and was assigned Vice General Staff for a brief period, then the head of Communist Party Committee of North Vietnamese Army's arm Military Zone IV in 1965, and Chief Command and Head of Communist Party Committee arm in North Vietnamese Volunteer Armed Troops in Central and Southern Laos. In late 1965, he was wounded and returned to Hanoi for medical treatment, he was assigned Vice Director of the Bureau of Logistics of North Vietnamese Army and Frontline Logistics, reporting to Dinh Duc Thien. In early 1967 (although he was offered the position in December 1966),Morris, Virginia and Hills, Clive. (2006). , Orchid Press. he was assigned Chief-in-Command of 559 Troop, replacing colonel Hoang Van Thai. He remained this position until 1976. Dong Sy Nguyen was one of important persons in constructing the Ho Chi Minh trail during Vietnam War. When he became commander of the Ho Chi Minh trail he converted it from an old low-key covert supply line into a modern strategic overt battlefield. Much of his success stemmed from the fact that he converted most of his forces, which had previously used foot power, bicycles or elephants to carry loads, into vehicle transportation units.Morris, Virginia and Hills, Clive. (2018). , McFarland & Co Inc. He then equipped these troops as fighting units and supported their activities with better supplied and fortified army stations, he installed an advanced communications network to link between stations and constructed a fuel pipeline that stretched across the mountains both in Lao and Vietnam.Morris, Virginia and Hills, Clive. (2018). , McFarland & Co Inc. Later he went on to strengthen anti-aircraft defenses, deployed surface-to-air missile sites at crucial locations to disrupt B-52 missions and designed mobile anti-aircraft detachments.Morris, Virginia and Hills, Clive. (2018). , McFarland & Co Inc. His rational for these changes was that there was no legal justification not to, and the trail needed to be transformed in order to support what North Vietnam needed to resource the war in the South, a situation partly linked to both China and the Soviets because they had agreed to increase their military aid to North Vietnam.Morris, Virginia and Hills, Clive. (2018). , McFarland & Co Inc. In 1974, he was conferred lieutenant-general. In 1976, he was promoted deputy minister of the Ministry of National Defense in charge of Economic Construction, then Minister of Construction, Minister of Transportation. In 1979, he returned to the military to assume Command-in-Chief and leader of the Communist Party of the Capital Military Zone (an arm of Vietnamese Army in charge of defending Hanoi). He was a member of the secession IV Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Back to civil duty From 1982, he was an alternate of the session V Politburo then member of Politburo of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam (the supreme power body of the Communist Party of Vietnam) (1986‚Äì1991) and Vice Chairman of the Council of the Ministers (Cabinet) and Minister of Transport. After he had retired from above positions, he was assigned as a special governmental envoy in charge of Programme 327 (an afforestation programme). He was assigned by Vietnamese prime minister Phan VƒÉn Kh·∫£i as the special envoy in supervision of Ho Chi Minh Highway. His wife is Nguyen Thi Ngoc Lan, they have 4 sons and 2 daughters.

Designed by Charles Seibel, the S-4 was evaluated by the United States Army under the designation YH-24 Sky Hawk, but would be rejected for service. The S-4B would serve as the basis for the design of the Cessna CH-1 Skyhook, the only helicopter Cessna ever produced. Development Charles Seibel began development on the S-4 after forming the Seibel Helicopter Company with funding from local Kansas oil investors. The S-4 was a continuation of his work on his previous design, the Seibel S-3, which he flew as a demonstrator for his design concepts; primarily a new design for a two- bladed rotor system and a simplified transmission. These features would also be incorporated into the S-4 design. In January 1949, the S-4 lifted off the ground for the first time, piloted by Johnny Gibbs. In March 1950, certification tests were completed and on 23 April 1950, the S-4 received civil certification by the CAA. A larger engine, the Lycoming O-290B with 125 hp, would be installed in the aircraft, making it the S-4A. Gov. Frank Carlson and Charles Seibel at the CAA Certification Ceremony Based on feedback from the Army during the evaluation, Seibel, shortened the fuselage of the second YH-24 (51-5113) and widened the cockpit for a co-pilot's seat next to the pilot's seat. Seibel also replaced that aircraft's original wheeled, tricycle undercarriage with landing skids. This aircraft would become the S-4B. Design The S-4 frame was a welded steel-tube box frame, with two decks. A lower deck supported the control panel, pilot's seat, wheeled, tricycle landing gear, and a small passenger/cargo area accessible from the rear, and an upper deck carried the engine, the fuel and oil tanks, and supported the transmission and rotor assembly. A tapered, monocoque, alloy tail boom with a two-bladed antitorque tail rotor was attached at the rear of the upper deck. Operational history Both the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force showed interest in the S-4. In early 1951, the U.S. Army ordered two examples for operational and engineering evaluation in the observation, utility, and aeromedical evacuation roles. The Army designated the S-4 as the YH-24 Sky Hawk. The first Sky Hawk, serial number 51-5112, was delivered to Fort Bragg, North Carolina in April 1951; the second YH-24, serial number 51-5113, was delivered to Wright Field. Despite the simplicity of the S-4, the Army determined that it did not provide a sufficient payload capability and the aircraft were dropped from the inventory and returned to Seibel in 1952.

Background Mahler began work on the Piano Quartet in A minor towards the end of his first year at the Vienna Conservatory, when he was around 15 or 16 years of age. The piece had its first performance on July 10, 1876, at the conservatory with Mahler at the piano, but it is unclear from surviving documentation whether the quartet was complete at this time. In several letters, Mahler mentions a quartet or quintet, but there is no clear reference to this piano quartet. Following this performance the work was performed at the home of Dr. Theodor Billroth, who was a close friend of Johannes Brahms.Bauer-Lechner, Natalie, Recollections of Gustav Mahler, ed. Peter Franklin, trs. Dika Newlin (London: Faber, 1980) The final known performance of the Quartet in the 19th century was at Iglau on September 12, 1876, with Mahler again at the piano; it was performed along with a violin sonata by Mahler that has not survived. It appears that at one point Mahler wished to publish the Quartet, as the surviving manuscript, which includes 24 bars of a scherzo for piano quartet written in G minor, bears the stamp of the publisher Theodor R√§ttig. Following the rediscovery of the manuscript by Mahler's widow Alma Mahler in the 1960s, the work was premiered in the United States on February 12, 1964, at the Philharmonic Hall in New York City by Peter Serkin and the Galimir Quartet.Work details, mahlercat.org.uk Four years later it was performed in the United Kingdom on June 1, 1968, at the Purcell Room, London, by the Nemet Ensemble. Structure The single-movement work, which is marked (not too fast), is scored for a standard piano quartet, (piano, violin, viola, and cello) and typically takes between 10 and 15 minutes to perform. Modern completions The existence of the 24-bar scherzo sketch (which is sometimes paired with the surviving complete movement) has resulted in attempts to complete the quartet by a number of composers. In 1988 the Russian composer Alfred Schnittke wrote a completion of this movement; he also used the fragment in the second movement of his Concerto Grosso No. 4/Symphony No. 5. The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra (RPhO) commissioned an orchestration of the quartet from the Dutch pianist and composer Marlijn Helder. It was premiered in May 2013 by the RPhO and conductor James Gaffigan. The Asian premiere was held in August 2013 with the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra. In popular culture The Quartet forms part of the soundtrack in Martin Scorsese's 2010 motion picture Shutter Island and is the subject of a short discussion between the movie's characters. Its complete performance by the Pra≈æ√°k Quartet is featured on the movie's double-CD soundtrack.

She is considered a rare example of a non-white female character in video games, though this assessment is considered by some to be problematic due to racial implications. Concept and creation Fran's visual appearance was designed by Akihiko Yoshida and her story was written by Daisuke Watanabe for Final Fantasy XII, which had a development period of 2001 to 2006.\\"Final Fantasy XII Developer Interviews\\". She is a Viera, a humanoid species that resembles rabbits. She is also co- pilot to her friend Balthier and the mechanic to their ship, the Strahl. Like all Viera, she is exceptionally sensitive to the magical mist that permeates Ivalice, the setting of Final Fantasy XII, which can send her into a rage. The decision to feature non-human species in the world of Final Fantasy XII was due to wanting to feature different races and social classes and to represent real-world history. Characters' outfits in Final Fantasy XII were made to show more skin due to the setting being hot. Fran was voiced by Nicole Fantl in English and by Rika Fukami in Japanese, while her motion capture work was performed by Hiroko Harada and Kouhei Takeda. Fukami had her speak in a \\"straightforward, slightly gruff\\" fashion. Localizer Alexander O. Smith took inspiration in writing Fran's English dialogue from Icelandic singer Bjork, casting for people who can actualize that inspiration. Smith said that he ideally wanted Bjork to be cast. Square Enix was initially skeptical of the direction they were taking with Fran's voice as it was significantly different from the Japanese version to a larger extent than the other lead characters, but the staff was able to convince them by explaining that they were trying a new take on her Viera race. Smith identified Fran and the other Viera as some of his favorite characters to write in Final Fantasy XII due to their Icelandic accents. Appearances Before the events of Final Fantasy XII, Fran lived with her sisters Jote and Mjrn in Eruyt Village, a secluded Viera settlement in Golmore Woods, but became restless and desired to see the outside world. This was a major source of conflict between her and the other Viera, especially her sister Jote, who served as the village matriarch. Fran argued that although all Viera begin their lives in the forest, they are not necessarily bound to remain there to the end. When the party encounters an impassable Viera barrier, Fran is forced to return to her former village and ask for help. She learns from Jote that their sister Mjrn has run off. When Fran finds her and brings her back, Mjrn reveals she wishes to leave Golmore, but Fran advises her against doing so, relating how her own independence has cost her her family and her spirituality with Golmore. After Fran departs, she feels as though Jote cares for her, despite her reluctance to say as much. She later appears in the Nintendo DS sequel Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings alongside Balthier, which is set on a place called the Sky Continent. She and Balthier initially work to destroy the auralith, one of multiple crystals that keep the Sky Continent afloat that protagonists Vaan and Penelo are trying to protect, though it is later explained that they were trying to prevent the souls of a people called the aegyl which reside in the auralith from being taken. In battle, Fran uses status effects against opponents, a unique combat ability among the playable cast. She also appears as a playable character in Itadaki Street Portable. She was included in Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia as a playable character, where she has the unique ability Viera Commandments. Reception Fran has received mostly positive reception. She is credited with popularizing the Viera race by PC Games N. Chris Carter and Joe Juba, writing for Game Informer and Destructoid respectively, both enjoyed Fran, regarding her and Balthier as standout characters among Final Fantasy XIIs cast. David Lozada and Aoife Wilson, writing for Game Revolution and Vice respectively, regarded her as a standout character in the Final Fantasy series, with the latter regarded a scene of her going into a rage as one of the most memorable in the series. She did not rank among a list of favorite female Final Fantasy characters by Japanese fans, which caused Mollie L. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly disappointment. Writers for IGN and Complex found her design attractive, with the former drawing a comparison between Fran and the Playboy bunny. Emma Boyes for IGN and Nadia Oxford for USGamer both enjoyed Fran's design in spite of the practicality of her armor and heels. Jef Rouner for Houston Press found her design attractive as well, identifying her as the hottest furry character. He noted her height, accent, and figure as highlights. Rouner also noted her as a rare example of black women in games, though he noted that she seemed to be more of an example of \\"exotic flavoring\\" due to her species. Responding to this assessment, Alisha Karabinus of NYM Gamer expressed discomfort at the idea of identifying a non- human character as black, commenting that \\"there's a lot to unpack\\" with this. Philip Boyes of Eurogamer took issue with Fran's portrayal, particularly how her design demonstrates \\"othering\\" and a \\"male fantasy.\\" Greg Vallentin of Video Gamer found her voice acting to be \\"cringey,\\" while writer Mattie Brice discussed how her accent is meant to differentiate her from the rest of the cast. Brice found her exotic, citing her accent, skin color, and species, though she felt that she had the least personality of the main cast.

Prior to that, he served two terms as mayor of Irvine, California. In 1998, he became the first Asian-American elected to the Irvine Unified School Board and served two consecutive terms there before becoming the first Asian American to have been elected to a four-year term on the Irvine City Council and one of two Korean Americans on the council.  Education and teaching career  Steven Choi was born in 1944 in Gyeongseong (now Seoul, South Korea) during Japanese occupation of Korea. Choi earned his B.A. from Kyung Hee University in 1966. In August 1968, Choi moved from Geumseong (now Naju), South Korea to the United States as a Peace Corps language instructor for the United States Department of State. He then continued his post-graduate education, earning his master's degree in library science from Louisiana State University in 1971 and Ph.D. in library and information science at the University of Pittsburgh in 1976. He has taught at several universities and colleges including the University of Southern California; University of California, Irvine; California State University, Los Angeles; Henderson State University; Saddleback College; and most recently Coastline Community College. He founded and serves as director of Dr. Choi's Academy, a tutoring and academic enrichment business.  Political career  Choi was elected to the Irvine Unified School District School Board in 1998 and reelected in 2002. He was elected to the Irvine City Council in 2004, becoming the first Asian American elected to a four-year term on the council. He and Sukhee Kang (elected to a two-year term on the same day) became the first two Asian Americans and Koreans elected to the Irvine City Council. Choi served on the Irvine City Council until 2012, when he defeated councilman Larry Agran in the mayoral election and was elected to a two-year term as Irvine's mayor. He was later reelected as mayor in 2014. The Irvine City Council is composed of 5 people, including the mayor. The council has 4 Republican members (Choi, Christina Shea, Lynn Schott, and Jeff Lalloway) and 1 Democratic member (Beth Krom). Choi is a part of the conservative council majority, and has been able to promote programs he supports and stop policies he opposes from being enacted. During the course of new sister city negotiations, he successfully opposed the One-China principle demanded by Shanghai's Xuhui government in the People's Republic of China, which would have required Irvine to abandon its existing long-term sister city relationship with Taoyuan, Taiwan. Choi serves as Chairman of the Orange County Public Library Advisory Board, which consists of Mayors and Council members from 27 Orange County cities, and is also Chairman of the Irvine Library Advisory Committee. He serves on the Orange County Great Park Corporation Board, the Irvine Redevelopment Agency, the Orange County Sanitation District Board and other countywide committees. His vision is to build a large Orange County/City Metropolitan Library at the Great Park. In addition, Choi is a member of the Concordia University President's Advisory Council and is Irvine‚Äôs representative to Growth Management Areas 4 and 9 and the Newport Bay Watershed Executive Committee. He formerly represented the 71st Assembly District on the Orange County Republican Party Central Committee. On June 3, 2008, he became the only incumbent to not be re-elected to the Orange County Republican Party Central Committee, coming in seventh with only 6.5% of the available vote. He is also a member of the Local Elected Officials Association and the 400 Club. In 2010, Choi sought election to the California State Assembly, but narrowly lost the Republican primary to Donald P. Wagner, who went on to win the general election. In 2016, Choi won election to the California State Assembly, narrowly defeating Anaheim City Councilman Harry Sidhu in the primary and winning the general election with 60% of the vote. =2016 California State Assembly = =2018 California State Assembly = =2020 California State Assembly =  Family  With his wife, Janie, and their two children, Choi has lived in Irvine since 1993 and in Mission Viejo from 1981‚Äì1993.

Spanish claims to the West Coast of North America date to the papal bull of 1493, and the Treaty of Tordesillas. In 1513, this claim was reinforced by Spanish explorer Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, the first European to sight the Pacific Ocean, when he claimed all lands adjoining this ocean for the Spanish Crown. Spain only started to colonize the claimed territory north of present-day Mexico in the 18th century, when it settled the northern coast of Las Californias (California). Starting in the mid-18th century, Spain's claim began to be challenged in the form of British and Russian fur trading and colonization. King Charles III of Spain and his successors sent a number of expeditions from New Spain to present-day Canada and Alaska between 1774 and 1793, to counter the threat of Russian and British colonizers and to strengthen the Spanish claim. During this period of history it was important for a nation's claims to be backed up by exploration and the \\"first European discovery\\" of particular places. 1774 voyage of P√©rez The first voyage was that of Juan Jos√© P√©rez Hern√°ndez of the frigate Santiago (alias Nueva Galicia). Although intending to reach Alaska, the expedition turned back at Haida Gwaii. P√©rez and his crew of 86 were the first known Europeans to visit the Pacific Northwest. 1775 voyage of Heceta and Bodega y Quadra In 1775 a second voyage of ninety men led by Lieutenant Bruno de Heceta aboard the Santiago, set sail from San Blas, Nayarit on March 16, 1775 with orders to make clear Spanish claims for the entire Northwestern Pacific Coast. Accompanying Heceta was the schooner Sonora, alias Felicidad, (also known as the Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe), initially under the command of Juan Manuel de Ayala. The long Sonora and its crew complement of 16 were to perform coastal reconnaissance and mapping, and could make landfall in places the larger Santiago was unable to approach on its previous voyage; in this way, the expedition could officially reassert Spanish claims to the lands north of New Spain it visited. Ayala took command of the packet boat San Carlos, alias Toys√≥n de Oro, also sailing with the expedition, after its initial commander, Miguel Manrique, took ill soon after leaving San Blas. Heceta then gave Bodega y Quadra command of the Sonora. Francisco Antonio Mourelle served as Bodega y Quadra's pilot and the two forged a strong and enduring friendship. The three vessels sailed together as far as Monterey Bay in Alta California. Ayala's mission was to explore the Golden Gate strait while Heceta and Bodega y Quadra continued north. Ayala and the crew of the San Carlos became the first Europeans known to enter San Francisco Bay. The Santiago and Sonora continued sailing north together as far as Point Grenville, named Punta de los Martires (or \\"Point of the Martyrs\\") by Heceta in response to an attack by the local Quinault Indians. The vessels parted company on the evening of July 29, 1775. Scurvy had so weakened the crew of the Santiago that Heceta decided to return to San Blas. On the way south he discovered the mouth of the Columbia River between present day Oregon and Washington. Juan P√©rez, who was serving as Heceta's pilot, died during the voyage south. Bodega y Quadra, in the Sonora, moved up the coast according to the expedition's orders, ultimately reaching the latitude 59¬∞ north on August 15, and entering Sitka Sound near the present-day town of Sitka, Alaska. During the return voyage south Bodega y Quadra discovered, named, and explored a portion of Bucareli Bay on the west side of Prince of Wales Island. During Bodega y Quadra's voyage numerous \\"acts of sovereignty\\" were performed. Many place names were given, including Puerto de Bucareli (Bucareli Bay), Puerto de los Remedios, and Mount San Jacinto, renamed Mount Edgecumbe by British explorer James Cook three years later. 1779 voyage of Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra Areas of Alaska and British Columbia Explored by Spain A third voyage took place in 1779 under the command of Ignacio de Arteaga with two armed corvettes: the Favorita under Arteaga, and the Princesa under Bodega y Quadra. With Arteaga on the Favorita was second officer Fernando Quiros y Miranda, surgeon Juan Garcia, pilot Jose Camacho, and second pilot Juan Pantoja y Arriaga. With Bodega y Quadra on the Princesa was second officer Francisco Antonio Mourelle, surgeon Mariano Nunez Esquivel, pilot Jose Canizares, and second pilot Juan Bautista Aguirre. The expedition's objective was to evaluate the Russian penetration of Alaska, search for a Northwest Passage, and capture James Cook if they found him in Spanish waters. Spain had learned about Cook's 1778 explorations along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. In June 1779, during the expedition of Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra, Spain entered the American Revolutionary War as an ally of France, precipitating a parallel Anglo-Spanish War, which continued until the 1783 Treaty of Paris. Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra did not find Cook, who had been killed in Hawaii in February 1779. During the voyage Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra carefully surveyed Bucareli Bay then headed north to Port Etches on Hinchinbrook Island. They entered Prince William Sound and reached a latitude of 61¬∞, the most northern point obtained by the Spanish explorations of Alaska. They also explored Cook Inlet, and the Kenai Peninsula, where a possession ceremony was performed on August 2, in what today is called Port Chatham. Due to various sicknesses among the crew Arteaga returned to California without finding the Russians. Throughout the voyage, the crews of both vessels endured many hardships, including food shortages and scurvy. On September 8, the ships rejoined and headed south for the return trip to San Blas. Although the Spanish were normally secretive about their exploring voyages and the discoveries made, the 1779 voyage of Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra became widely known. La Perouse obtained a copy of their map, which was published in 1798. Mourelle's journal was acquired and published in London in 1798 by Daines Barrington. After these three exploration voyages to Alaska within five years there were no further Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest until 1788, after the Treaty of Paris ended the war between Spain and Britain. During the war Spain dedicated the port of San Blas to the war effort in the Philippines. Voyages of exploration were suspended. Support of Alta California, which depended upon San Blas, was minimal. By 1786 Alta California had become nearly self- supporting and peace with Britain was restored, making further voyages to Alaska possible. 1788 voyage of Mart√≠nez and Haro In March, 1788, two ships were sent north from San Blas to investigate Russian activity. Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez, on the Princesa, was in command of the expedition, accompanied by the San Carlos under Gonzalo L√≥pez de Haro, with Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez serving as Haro's pilot. The ships arrived at Prince William Sound in May. Following evidence of Russian fur trading activity the ships sailed west. In June Haro reached Kodiak Island and learned from the natives that a Russian post was nearby. On June 30, 1788, Haro sent Narv√°ez in a longboat to look for the Russian post at Three Saints Bay. Narv√°ez found the post, becoming the first Spaniard to make contact with a large contingent of Russians in Alaska. Narv√°ez took the Russian commander, Evstrat Delarov to meet Haro on the San Carlos, then returned him to his outpost. Delarov gave Narv√°ez a Russian map of the Alaskan coast and indicated the locations of seven Russian posts containing nearly 500 men. Delarov also told Narv√°ez that the Russians intended to occupy Nootka Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. After this meeting Haro sailed east and joined Mart√≠nez at Sitkinak Island. Using the information acquired from Delarov, the expedition sailed to Unalaska Island, where there was a large Russian post, also called Unalaska, under the command of Potap Kuzmich Zaikov. Mart√≠nez arrived on July 29, Haro on August 4. Zaikov gave Mart√≠nez three maps covering the Aleutian Islands. He also confirmed that the Russians planned to take possession of Nootka Sound the next year. Zaikov explained that two Russian frigates were already on their way, and a third which was to sail to Nootka Sound. He was referring to the 1789 expedition of Joseph Billings, but greatly exaggerating its mission.Billings, Joseph, Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online The visit to Unalaska marks the westernmost point reached during the Spanish voyages of exploration in Alaska. The Spanish expedition left Unalaska on August 18, 1788, heading south for California and Mexico. Due to increasing conflict between Mart√≠nez and Haro, the ships broke off contact within three days sailed south separately. Mart√≠nez had allowed this but ordered Haro to rejoin him at Monterey, California. But during the voyage south Haro, with support from Narv√°ez and the other pilots, declared his ship no longer under Mart√≠nez's command. They sailed back to San Blas on their own, arriving on October 22, 1788. Mart√≠nez spent a month in Monterey waiting for Haro. He arrived at San Blas in December, where he found himself faced with charges of irresponsible leadership. He soon regained favor and was placed in charge of a new expedition to occupy Nootka Sound before the Russians did. This expedition took place in 1789, culminating in the Nootka Crisis. 1789 settlement in Nootka Sound Following up on the 1788 voyage to Alaska, Mart√≠nez and Haro were ordered to preemptively take possession of Nootka Sound before the Russians or British could. Events at Nootka Sound in 1789 led to the Nootka Crisis. During the summer of 1789 Mart√≠nez sent Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez to explore the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the Santa Gertrudis la Magna (formerly the Northwest America, a British vessel captured earlier by Mart√≠nez at Nootka Sound). Narv√°ez found the Strait of Juan de Fuca to be a large inlet with much promise for further exploration. By the end of the year Mart√≠nez abandoned Nootka Sound. 1790 Spanish base in Nootka Sound The Nootka Crisis became a major international incident nearly leading to war between Spain and Britain. As the process unfolded, the Viceroy of New Spain decided it was important to establish a permanent base at Nootka Sound. Three ships sailed to Nootka Sound, with Francisco de Eliza as the overall commander and captain of the Concepci√≥n. Manuel Quimper captained Princesa Real (the Spanish name for the British vessel , captured by Mart√≠nez in 1789). Salvador Fidalgo captained the San Carlos. The first settlement in present-day British Columbia was built on Nootka Sound, Santa Cruz de Nuca as well as Fort San Miguel, manned by soldiers of the First Company of Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia, under Pedro de Alberni. After getting settled, Eliza dispatched Fidalgo and Quimper on exploration voyages. Fidalgo was sent north and Quimper south. 1790 voyage of Fidalgo In 1790, Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo took the San Carlos to Alaska, visiting and naming Cordova Bay and Port Valdez in Prince William Sound. Acts of sovereignty were performed at both places. Fidalgo entered Cook Inlet and found the Russian post Pavlovskaia, the Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin Company post at the mouth of the Kenai River. Fidalgo did not stop at the post but continued west to Kodiak Island, where he noted Shelikov's post. Fidalgo then went to the Russian settlement at Alexandrovsk (today's English Bay or Nanwalek, Alaska), southwest of today's Anchorage on the Kenai Peninsula, where again, Fidalgo asserted the Spanish claim to the area by conducting a formal ceremony of sovereignty.History of Spanish exploration of Pacific Northwest and Alaska 1790 voyage of Quimper In 1790 Manuel Quimper, with officers L√≥pez de Haro and Juan Carrasco, sailed the Princesa Real into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, following up on voyage of Narv√°ez the previous year. Quimper sailed to the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, discovering the San Juan Islands and many straits and inlets. Having limited time he had to return to Nootka without fully exploring the promising straits and inlets. Contrary winds made it impossible to sail the small vessel to Nootka, so Quimper went south to San Blas instead. 1791 voyage of Eliza In 1791 Francisco de Eliza was ordered to continue the exploration of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The voyage consisted of two vessels. Eliza sailed on the San Carlos, with Pantoja as his pilot (master). Narv√°ez sailed on the Santa Saturnina, with Carrasco and Verd√≠a as pilots. During the voyage the Strait of Georgia was discovered, and Narv√°ez conducted a quick exploration of most of it. Eliza sailed the San Carlos back to Nootka Sound, but the Santa Saturnina, under Carrasco, failed to reach Nootka and instead sailed south to Monterey and San Blas. In Monterey Carrasco met Alessandro Malaspina and told him about the discovery of the Strait of Georgia. This meeting led directly to the 1792 voyage of Galiano and Vald√©s. 1789-1794 voyage of Malaspina and Bustamante The King of Spain gave Alejandro Malaspina and Jos√© de Bustamante y Guerra command of an around-the- world scientific expedition with two corvettes, the Descubierta and Atrevida. One of the king's orders was to investigate a possible Northwest Passage. The expedition was also to search for gold, precious stones, and any American, British, or Russian settlements along the northwest coast. Arriving in Alaska in 1791, Malaspina and Bustamante surveyed the coast to the Prince William Sound. At Yakutat Bay, the expedition made contact with the Tlingit. Spanish scholars made a study of the tribe, recording information on social mores, language, economy, warfare methods, and burial practices. Artists with the expedition, Tomas de Suria and Jos√© Cardero, produced portraits of tribal members and scenes of Tlingit daily life. Malaspina Glacier, between Yakutat Bay and Icy Bay was subsequently named after Alessandro Malaspina. 1792 voyage of Galiano and Vald√©s In 1792 Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano, on the Sutil, and Cayetano Vald√©s y Flores, on the Mexicana, sailed from San Blas to Nootka Sound, then circumnavigated Vancouver Island. An account of the voyage of Galiano and Vald√©s, in contrast, was published in Spain and widely promoted, overshadowing the more significant voyage of Malaspina, who had become a political prisoner shortly after returning to Spain. 1792 voyage of Caama√±o Jacinto Caama√±o, commander of the frigate Ar√°nzazu, sailed to Bucareli Bay in 1792. Juan Pantoja y Arriaga served as his pilot. Caama√±o conducted a detailed survey of the coast south to Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. By 1792 much of the coast had already been visited by European explorers, but some areas had been overlooked, such as the southern part of Prince of Wales Island. A number of Caama√±o's place names in the area have survived, such as Cordova Bay, Revillagigedo Channel, Bocas de Quadra, and in what is now called Caama√±o Passage, Zayas Island (named for his second pilot, Juan Zayas). No report on Caama√±o's voyage was published until long after and his discoveries remained obscure, although George Vancouver apparently met Caama√±o and obtained copies of his maps, especially of areas north of Dixon Entrance. Vancouver later incorporated some of Caama√±o's place names into his atlas. 1793 voyage of Eliza and Mart√≠nez y Zayas In 1793 Francisco de Eliza and Juan Mart√≠nez y Zayas surveyed the coast between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the San Francisco Bay. They also explored the mouth of the Columbia River. Legacy Spanish territorial claims in the North West Coast of North America, 18th century In the end Spain withdrew from the North Pacific and transferred its claims in the region to the United States in the Adams-On√≠s Treaty of 1819. Today, Spain's legacy in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest endures as a number of place names, such as Malaspina Glacier, Revillagigedo Island, the towns of Valdez and Cordova, and numerous smaller features.

Early life and career Harmon was born and raised in Oak Park where he attended St. Giles Grade School. He graduated from St. Ignatius High School on Chicago's West Side, Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, and the University of Chicago (J.D. and M.B.A.). After law school, Harmon served in Springfield on the House legal staff. Harmon is a partner at the Chicago-based law firm Burke, Burns & Pinelli. Political career In August 2000, Don Harmon was nominated by members of the Democratic Party of Oak Park to fulfill the term of former Illinois Senate President Phil Rock as Oak Park Democratic Committeeman. He was then elected to his first full term as Committeeman in 2002 and has since been re-elected in 2006 and 2010. In 2010, Harmon was elected to serve as the Suburban Vice-Chair of the Democratic Party of Cook County. =Illinois Senate= First elected in the fall of 2002, Harmon served alongside then- State Senator and now former U.S. President Barack Obama. In the State Senate, Harmon voted for a bill that allows government to charge citizens for Freedom of Information Act requests. Critics of the bill argued it weakens the public's ability to receive information from the government. The bill passed with dissenting votes from Democrats and Republicans. Harmon introduced legislation to legalize sports betting in Illinois. The bill \\"would allow wagering on professional and collegiate sports,\\" according to one report. Harmon sponsored legislation creating the Illinois Early Learning Council to create policy recommendations regarding the education of children from birth to age five. The result of that effort was the Pre-School for All program implemented throughout the state. He also authored the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003 to prohibit discriminatory policies by state, county or local governments, and to preserve for Illinois citizens civil rights protections eroded by recent U.S. Supreme Court Decisions. Additionally he helped pass legislation to eliminate two obsolete taxing districts-the Cook County Tuberculosis Sanitarium District and the Cicero Township Trustee of Schools saving taxpayers millions of dollars.

In 2017, the Chicago Sun-Times reported on Harmon's dual role as legislator and as an attorney handling state clients. A 2012 report alleges that Harmon refused to answer questions connected to his law practice. In 2019, another report by the Chicago Sun-Times highlighted the relationship between Harmon's firm and clout-heavy lobbyist Frank Cortese. Cortese is a close affiliate of convicted Teamsters boss John Coli. The Sun- Times revealed that Cortese set up a lobbying business \\"with the help of a clout-heavy law firm of Burke Burns & Pinelli, whose attorneys have donated heavily to Madigan‚Äôs campaigns over the years.

It carries conspicuous orange woody fruits about 1 cm in diameter for several months after flowering in spring or early summer. It is sometimes also known as sweet pittosporum, native daphne, Australian cheesewood, Victorian box or mock orange. Pittosporum is a fast growing tree, and has become invasive in parts of Australia where it is not indigenous. It is also highly invasive in South Africa, the Caribbean, Hawaii, the Azores and southern Brazil. Description Pittosporum undulatum grows as a shrub or small tree to 15 m (50 ft) tall. Taxonomy French botanist √âtienne Pierre Ventenat described Pittosporum undulatum in 1802. Distribution and habitat Originally Pittosporum undulatum grew in moist areas on the Australian east coast, where its natural range was from south-east Queensland to eastern Victoria, but has increased its range since European settlement. Ecology Likely pollinators of its flowers are moths and butterflies, as the flower produces a fragrant perfume at night. The fruit are eaten by currawongs, red- whiskered bulbuls, Indian mynahs and grey-headed flying fox. Seed is dispersed in bird faeces. Invasive species The earliest known record (according to the Australian Virtual Herbarium) is from Port Jackson, Sydney, in 1803. However, P. undulatum's status around the Sydney area is contentious. Even though it is native to the region, P. undulatum has spread to soils and bushland where it wasn't found before European settlement, often out-competing other plants. Pittosporum has done especially well in areas where the environment has been altered by humans ‚Äì for example by habitat fragmentation weakening other natives, by fertilizer runoff from homes increasing soil nutrients and by the suppression of bushfires near suburbs. Unlike most natives, P. undulatum takes advantage of high nutrient levels and its seeds can germinate without needing fire. This has led to the species sometimes receiving the \\"invasive\\" label although some think that it is merely returning to areas where it grew before people arrived in Australia and began burning the environment far beyond that which previously occurred. Recommended control measures have included the identification and selective removal of female trees to prevent spread, as well as careful burning, where possible, together with follow-up weeding.

Thrall,G.,I.,Ph.D.(2009)/Professor, Department of Geography, College of Liberal Arts And Sciences and Miller Center For Retail, College of Business, University of Florida It involves layering multiple data sets spatially and/or chronologically, for easy reference on a map, and its applications span industries, categories and organizations. Maps have been used to represent information throughout the ages, but what might be referenced as the first example of true location 'intelligence' was in London in 1854 when John Snow was able to debunk theories about the spread of cholera by overlaying a map of the area with the location of water pumps and was able to narrow the source to a single water pump. This layering of information over a map was able to identify relationships between different sets of geospatial data. Location or geographical information system (GIS) tools enable spatial experts to collect, store, analyze and visualize data. Location intelligence experts can use a variety of spatial and business analytical tools to measure optimal locations for operating a business or providing a service. Location intelligence experts begin with defining the business ecosystem which has many interconnected economic influences. Such economic influences include but are not limited to culture, lifestyle, labor, healthcare, cost of living, crime, economic climate and education. Further definitions The term \\"location intelligence\\" is often used to describe the people, data and technology employed to geographically \\"map\\" information. These mapping applications can transform large amounts of data into color-coded visual representations that make it easy to see trends and generate meaningful intelligence. The creation of location intelligence is directed by domain knowledge, formal frameworks, and a focus on decision support. Location cuts across through everything i.e. devices, platforms, software and apps, and is one of the most important ingredients of understanding context in sync with social data, mobile data, user data, sensor data. Location intelligence is also used to describe the integration of a geographical component into business intelligence processes and tools, often incorporating spatial database and spatial OLAP tools. In 2012, Wayne Gearey from the real estate industry (JLL) offered the first applied course on location intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas in which he defined location intelligence as the process for selecting the optimal location that will support workplace success and address a variety of business and financial objectives. Pitney Bowes MapInfo Corporation describes location intelligence as follows: \\"Spatial information, commonly known as \\"Location\\", relates to involving, or having the nature of where. Spatial is not constrained to a geographic location however most common business uses of spatial information deal with how spatial information is tied to a location on the earth. Miriam-Webster¬Æ defines Intelligence as \\"The ability to learn or understand, or the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one\`s environment.\\" Combining these terms alludes to how you achieve an understanding of the spatial aspect of information and apply it to achieve a significant competitive advantage.\\" Definition by ESRI is as follows: \\"Location Intelligence is defined as the capacity to organize and understand complex data through the use of geographic relationships. LI organizes business and geographically referenced data to reveal the relationship of location to people, events, transactions, facilities, and assets.\\" Definition by Yankee Group within their White Paper \\"Location Intelligence in Retail Banking: \\"...a business management term that refers to spatial data visualization, contextualization and analytical capabilities applied to solve a business problem.\\" Commercial applications Location intelligence is used by a broad range of industries to improve overall business results.

Beginning his career during the Big Band Era, Heller spent more than 60 years in the entertainment industry. He was best known for his association with Liberace, whom he signed in 1950 and represented until the entertainer died in 1987. Career While attending college at Case Western University in the late 1930s, Heller worked for MCA, then a thriving talent agency. Based in his hometown of Cleveland, he represented the leading artists of the day, including Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Sammy Kaye, Glen Gray and Count Basie, among others. Heller joined the Coast Guard during World War II. His entertainment expertise became the foundation for his service in the military, where he acted as an advance man for Tars and Spars, a comedy show and recruiting vehicle starring Victor Mature, Sid Caesar, Gower Champion and Bob Fosse. In 1945, after the conclusion of the war, Heller moved to Los Angeles and in 1947 partnered with associates Dick Gabbe and Sam J. Lutz to form the first coast-to-coast personal management firm, Gabbe, Lutz and Heller. The launch of Gabbe, Lutz and Heller marked the beginning of Heller's lengthy association with The Treniers, whom he managed for nearly 60 years. In addition, Heller represented Ginger Rogers, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Helen O'Connell, Frankie Lane, Regis Philbin, The Standells, Jimmie Rodgers, The McGuire Sisters, and Lawrence Welk, among many others. Gabbe, Lutz and Heller was the preeminent personal management company of the time, and was considered a pioneering talent agency. In 1950, singer Wladziu Valentino Liberace, known as Liberace, invited Heller to a performance at the Hotel Coronado in San Diego, California. Heller immediately agreed to represent the performer, who later called his first impression of Liberace ‚Äúlightning in a bottle.‚Äù Heller is credited with ‚Äúlaunching the Liberace rocket ride,‚Äù which included a weekly television show, an immediate success which was syndicated to more than 200 television stations by 1954. Additionally, in the early part of his association with Heller, Liberace broke records as he quickly sold out performances at Carnegie Hall, the Hollywood Bowl, and Royal Albert Hall, among others. In 1954, more than 120,000 concertgoers came to a Liberace show at Chicago‚Äôs Soldier‚Äôs Field, setting a still-impressive attendance record, and in 1955, Heller negotiated the then unheard of sum of $50,000 per week when Liberace opened Las Vegas' Riviera Hotel. From the 1950s through the 1970s, Liberace was the highest-paid performer in the world, and he continued to break records into the 1980s, when he made a year's gross of $1,665,331 at Radio City Music Hall. Under Heller‚Äôs superintendence, Liberace achieved multi-platform success; according to a 1985 article in Billboard magazine, Heller shaped the strategies that would ensure a long and profitable career for Liberace, and that his ‚Äúpragmatic vision made Liberace into what he is -- one of the longest-running success stories in show business today.‚Äù Heller managed Liberace until the entertainer‚Äôs death in 1987. Heller later owned the renowned recording studio Producer's Workshop (later called Westbeach Recorders) in Hollywood, where Liberace recorded in his later years, as well as pop music luminaries Fleetwood Mac, Ringo Starr, Pink Floyd and many others. He also had a partnership with Ray Harris in the early disco record label American Variety International (AVI), which produced and released many records between 1974 and 1984 and also owned interests in music publishing. He did other business under the names Attarack/Heller and Associates in the 1960s, and Seymour Heller and Associates in 1984. Heller died of natural causes in his Beverly Hills home on October 8, 2001. The Seymour Heller Awards In 1954, Heller co-founded the Talent Managers Association, formerly known as the National Conference of Personal Managers. A non-profit designed to promote and encourage the highest standards of professional ethics and behavior in the practice of talent management, Heller was an active member of The Talent Managers Association from its inception until his death in 2001. In honor of his memory, the members of the organization, along with Heller‚Äôs family, created the Seymour Heller Awards, given to ‚Äúrecognize those industry professionals who operate with the dedication, high standards and ethical treatment that Seymour achieved in his lifetime.‚Äù In pop culture Known for his outsized personality, Heller was often referred to by his nickname, the Shagman. In a 1989 feature in Details, writer Allee Willis describes him as ‚ÄúSeymour or Shagman or simply the Shag, a beacon of light in the long annals of Hollywood history. In the world of management, where heads are made of concrete and life is seen through a roll of dollar bills, Shag is a prince, a saint and a true believer. He is as happening today as he was fifty years ago, the first to arrive at the party and the last to leave.‚Äù He appeared as himself on a 1983 episode of the television series Hotel, and was credited as a special guest in a 1990 television movie, Mother Goose‚Äôs Rock N Rhyme. In addition, Heller made frequent appearances in music videos, most notably as a weather man in Breakfast Club's clip in 1987, and as a caricature of himself in Jimmy Buffett‚Äôs in 1988. Heller figured prominently into two 1988 television films documenting Liberace‚Äôs life, Liberace and Liberace: Behind the Music. In 2013 a third film, Behind the Candelabra, aired on HBO. The movie stars Michael Douglas as Liberace and Dan Aykroyd as Heller. Heller was also the subject of A Tribute To Seymour Heller, a 2008 short, honoring his career. Philanthropy While Heller preferred to keep his philanthropic activities private, his support for the Famous People Players of Canada was well documented. A puppet show performed by mentally handicapped adults, The Famous People Players of Canada created a Liberace puppet and soon thereafter enlisted Heller to support their efforts. Heller booked the Famous People Players of Canada to open Liberace's show in Las Vegas in 1975, and subsequently sat on the troupe's board. Heller was also active in The Liberace Foundation, which helped talented students in Southern Nevada pursue careers in the performing and creative arts through scholarship assistance and artistic exposure. Family Heller married Biller Rosenfield in 1951. A former secretary, she founded and chaired the National Committee on the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination of Women and is a noted consumer rights activist. The Hellers had two sons, David and Bruce, and a daughter, Liz. She is the founder of Buzztone, a Los Angeles-based marketing and media company.

Graduate recruitment programs are widespread in most of the developed world. Employers commonly attend campuses to promote employment vacancies and career opportunities to students who are considering their options following graduation. In the United Kingdom, the process of employers visiting a series of universities to promote themselves is called the milk round. Selection methods used by employers include interviews, aptitude tests, role plays, written assessments, group discussions and presentations. Many schools, colleges and universities provide their students with independent advice via a careers advisory service which is staffed by professional careers advisors. The careers advisory service often organizes a careers fair or job fair where a large number of employers visit the campus at once giving students the opportunity to meet a range of potential employers. Employers involved in graduate programs often form themselves into professional bodies or associations to share best practice or to collaborate in setting a recruitment code of practice. Larger companies with high levels of graduate employment opportunities often install online recruitment devices to deal with the high number of applications. These can be made up of several question based screening stages in which the candidate has to pass before reaching an interview. Careers advisors also form themselves into professional bodies or associations to ensure that current best practice is shared across members and passes onto students. Examples of professional associations in the graduate recruitment sector include the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) in the United States, the Canadian Association of Careers Educators and Employers (CACEE) in Canada, the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) and the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services (AGCAS) in the United Kingdom and the Australian Association of Graduate Employers (AAGE) in Australia.
