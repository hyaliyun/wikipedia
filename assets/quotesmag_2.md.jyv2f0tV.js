Anti-MCV antibodies are a member of the ACPA family, a group of the so-called antibodies to citrullinated protein/peptide antigens. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. Detection of specific autoantibodies (antibodies directed against the body‚Äôs own tissue) such as rheumatoid factors and ACPAs may provide indication of the disease. In many cases, autoimmune diagnostics are crucial for diagnosing RA correctly and already in the disease‚Äôs early stages, when typical symptoms often are lacking but when medical therapy is most effective.  Basics Citrullination is a modification of proteins where a nitrogen in the amino acid arginine is replaced with an oxygen, converting it into citrulline. The modified (citrullinated) protein may be identified by as foreign, provoking an autoimmune inflammation response. Various kinds of citrullinated proteins have been detected in the joints of RA patients. One of these is Sa antigen, now known as mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV). Citrullination of vimentin plays a decisive role in RA pathogenesis.  Significance  point-of-care testing for rheumatoid arthritis using the rheumachec rapid test In rheumatology diagnostics, autoantibodies against mutated citrullinated vimentin (anti-MCV) are of prominent diagnostic and prognostic value. Their significance is greater than that of rheumatoid factor. Recently a serological point-of-care test (POCT) for the early detection of RA has been developed. This assay combines the detection of rheumatoid factor and anti-MCV for diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and shows a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 99.7%. Anti-MCV are used as efficient biomarkers for estimating progress of rheumatoid arthritis. Main advantage of testing for anti-MCV is the early appearance of the anti-MCV antibodies, what allows for detection of early RA and submits adequate therapy just after the disease‚Äôs onset. Moreover, anti-MCV titres show strong correlation to disease activity, disease severity and the success of therapy.

A (here, ) The submarines HMS Vanguard and Triomphant collided in the Atlantic Ocean in the night between 3-4 February 2009. Both are nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. The Royal Navy's and the French Navy's both sustained damage, but no injuries or radioactivity releases were reported. At the time of the collision, both vessels were submerged and moving \\"at very low speed\\" according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Both are equipped with active and passive sonar, although only the latter is used on an operational patrol. Submarines HMS Vanguard was on a routine patrol in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean with a crew of 135, and can carry a maximum load of 16 Trident II D5 ballistic missiles, with a standard patrol load of 48 warheads. Triomphant was returning from a tour of duty when the incident occurred; it was carrying a crew of 111, and capable of being equipped with 16 M45 ballistic missiles, with a standard patrol load of 48 warheads. Collision On the night between 3‚Äì4 February 2009, the two submarines collided in the Atlantic Ocean. On 6 February 2009, the French Ministry of Defence reported that Triomphant \\"collided with an immersed object (probably a container)\\" Incident sous-marin, French Ministry of Defence The UK Ministry of Defence initially would not comment that the incident took place. On 16 February 2009, the incident was confirmed by First Sea Lord Sir Jonathon Band, in response to a question at an unrelated event. Band said that the collision occurred at low speed, and that there had been no injuries. The French Ministry of Defence also stated that a collision \\"at a very low speed\\" had occurred, with no casualties. Communiqu√© du minist√®re de la D√©fense du 16-02-09 Both vessels were damaged. Vanguard received damage to the outer casing in the area of the missile compartment on the starboard (right) side. Triomphant was initially said to have received damage to the active sonar dome under her bow, indicating that Triomphant ran into Vanguard from above and amidship, but was later reported as having received impacts to three parts of her structure, with her conning tower and the starboard sail plane attached to the conning tower visibly deformed by the incident. According to The Daily Telegraph, the cost of repairing the damage to both boats was expected to amount to up to (equivalent to about ¬£M in ). Both vessels returned to home bases under their own power, Vanguard to Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde in the Firth of Clyde on 14 February 2009, and Triomphant to √éle Longue in Brittany, escorted by a frigate as a normal procedure. Possible cause Media reports have discussed two possible aspects contributing to the incident; geographic separation of the submarine operating areas (known as waterspace management), and the ability of each submarine to detect the other using acoustic methods. While the use of active sonar may have revealed the position of one submarine to the other, it is unlikely either boat was operating its active sonar at the time of the collision. Ballistic missile submarines are designed to conceal themselves while on patrol, and the use of active sonar would immediately reveal the boat's position. Several media outlets stated that because both submarines are equipped with modern anechoic tile coverings over their hulls and were travelling at low speed, it would have been unlikely for either submarine to have detected the presence of the other while using only their passive sonar systems. Further, as reported by Time magazine, submarines take advantage of environmental characteristics, such as ocean currents of varying temperatures (thermoclines) or varying salinity (haloclines), to avoid detection. The British Broadcasting Corporation has speculated that though highly improbable considering the vastness of the areas in which they operate, the actual areas used by ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) are in reality limited, and overlap. They have claimed that the use of these areas by submarines of the British, French and Russian navies has increased the risk of accidental collision. Several media outlets have referred to comments by retired Royal Navy Commodore Stephen Saunders, editor of the Jane's Fighting Ships, where he described the incident as \\"very serious\\" and said it was time for France and Britain to coordinate their submarine operations more actively, suggesting that the use of operating areas is not communicated between operators of SSBNs; France, the UK and the United States or that communication procedures were not effective. \\"I would have thought it possible to at least arrange to be in different parts of the ocean without compromising operational security,\\" said Saunders. \\"No doubt there are a number of technical issues to be investigated, but the root of the problem appears to be procedural.\\" This position appears to be corroborated by Admiral Sandy Woodward, a former commander of the Royal Navy's submarine force. In a commentary article for The Independent newspaper, he said that whilst it is not known whether the UK and France exchange information now, it was not the case when he served as Flag Officer Submarines in 1984. He recalls that his French counterpart proposed that London and Paris share information on SSBN patrols, precisely to avoid an incident at sea, but no agreement was reached at the time on achieving that. Aftermath With the delayed acknowledgement of the accident, both the British and French ministries of defence were accused of attempting a cover-up of the collision. The delay in reporting the accident was also criticised in the international press. British MP Nick Harvey demanded an official inquiry into the issue. Kate Hudson, a member of the Communist Party of Britain who was chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament at the time, said, \\"The collision of two submarines, both with nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons onboard could have released vast amounts of radiation and scattered scores of nuclear warheads across the seabed\\". A government spokesman said that there \\"was no compromise to nuclear safety\\". Herv√© Morin, France's Minister of Defence, said that they \\"face an extremely simple technological problem, which is that these submarines are not detectable\\".

It is located next to Piazza Garibaldi to the east of the old city. It is the primary rail terminus and station for Naples, and serves Trenitalia national railways and EAV. This one has an underground section known as Stazione di Napoli Piazza Garibaldi (Naples Garibaldi Piazza station), which is served by the metropolitan trains of the line 2, line 1 (Garibaldi), and 3, 12, 14, and 15 EAV Circumvesuviana lines which is accessible from 2 entrances inside the Centrale station, 1 outside in glass, and from the new Garibaldi Square. History The first station on the site was built in 1866 on a design by the architect Enrico Alvino and it was opened on 7 May of the following year. The current station was designed in 1954 by Pier Luigi Nervi, Carlo Cocchia, Massimo Battaglini, Bruno Zevi, Giulio De Luca, Luigi Piccinato and Joseph Vaccaro on the site of the old railway station and overlooks the square dedicated to Giuseppe Garibaldi. The project was completed in 1960. The station has undergone a deep restyling lasting five years and finished in August 2010, which concerned both the platform and the underground floor, with the installation of new escalators, elevators, lights, benches, shops and the replacement of the original floors made in black linoleum with a more modern white tile covering. Transport The station has 25 tracks. It is connected to Rome by high-speed trains on the Rome‚ÄìNaples high-speed railway line as well as slower trains on the original Rome‚ÄìCassino‚ÄìNaples line and the Rome‚ÄìFormia‚ÄìNaples Direttissima opened in 1927. It is connected to Salerno and southern Italy by the traditional Naples‚ÄìSalerno line and the recently opened Naples‚ÄìSalerno high-speed line used by long distance trains. Train services The station is served by the following services (incomplete): *High speed services (Frecciarossa) Turin - Milan - Reggio Emilia - Bologna - Florence - Rome - Naples - Salerno **2 trains a day extend north to Brescia and 2 trains extend south to Taranto *High speed services (Frecciarossa) Venice - Padua - Bologna - Florence - Rome - Naples - Salerno *High speed services (Frecciargento) Rome - Naples - Salerno - Paola - Lamezia Terme - Rosarno - Reggio di Calabria *High speed services (Frecciargento) Bolzano - Trento - Rovereto - Verona - Bologna - Florence - Rome - Naples *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Rome - Naples - Salerno - Sapri - Lamezia - Vibo Valentia - Reggio Calabria *High speed services (Italo) Turin - Milan - Reggio Emilia - Bologna - Florence - Rome - Naples - Salerno *High speed services (Italo) Brescia - Desenzano - Peschiera del Garda - Verona - Bologna - Florence - Rome - Naples *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Messina - Palermo *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Messina - Siracusa *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Reggio di Calabria *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Taranto *Intercity services Turin - Genoa - La Spezia - Pisa - Livorno - Rome - Naples - Salerno *Intercity services Livorno - Civitavecchia - Rome - Naples *Night train (Intercity Notte) Rome - Naples - Messina - Siracusa *Night train (Intercity Notte) Turin - Genoa - La Spezia - Pisa - Livorno - Rome - Naples - Salerno *Regional services (Treno Regionale) Rome - Pomezia - Latina - Formia - Minturno - Naples Napoli Piazza Garibaldi railway station Below the mainline station is an underground station named Napoli Piazza Garibaldi railway station, for the Villa Literno‚ÄìNapoli Gianturco railway, used by the metropolitan train of the line 2.

He is known for his critical approach to global political economy and has published, amongst others, Flight MH17, Ukraine and the New Cold War. Prism of Disaster (2018), a trilogy on Modes of Foreign Relations and Political Economy (2007, 2010, 2014); Global Rivalries from the Cold War to Iraq (2006); Transnational Classes and International Relations (1998); and The Making of an Atlantic Ruling Class (1984, reprinted 2012).  Biography  Kees van der Pijl studied law at Leiden University from 1965 to 1967. After military service as a reserve officer in the Royal Dutch Military Police, and a trip through the Soviet Union to Japan in 1970, he switched to political science, a specialisation taught in Leiden as part of the public law degree. His most influential teachers were , , and the Indologist, J.C. Heesterman, with whom he wrote his final thesis on the politics of regional diversity in India. He graduated in 1973 and was hired as a junior lecturer by the Department of International Relations at the University of Amsterdam in that year. In 1983 he received his doctorate at the University of Amsterdam on a thesis titled Imperialism and Class Formation in the North Atlantic Area, supervised by Gerd Junne. He was involved in the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN) and also published short stories and three novels (1989, 1992, 1994, all with De Harmonie). Van der Pijl was co-director of the Research Centre for International Political Economy (Recipe) from 1992 to 1998. With Henk Overbeek, Ries Bode, Otto Holman, Bastiaan van Apeldoorn and others, this created a tentative Amsterdam School of global political economy.International Journal of Political Economy, 19: 3, 1989Journal of International Relations and Development, 7: 2, 2004 In 2000, Van der Pijl moved to the United Kingdom to take up the chair in international relations at the University of Sussex, vacant after the retirement of Professor Michael Nicholson. He was appointed director of the Centre for Global Political Economy (CGPE) at that university when it was launched in 2001 (until 2006), and was subject chair/head of the Department of Politics and International Relations from 2002 to 2004. In 2006 he was awarded a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship. He has taught as a visiting professor at the University of Auvergne at Clermont-Ferrand (2005, 2006) and at L‚ÄôOrientale University in Naples (2009, 2010). His work has been nominated for prizes in 2007 and 2008 and he was awarded the Deutscher Memorial Prize in 2008 for Nomads, Empires, States (Pluto 2007). On his return to the Netherlands he joined the Dutch Anti-Fascist Resistance (AFVN/BvA, issued from the wartime communist underground). He served as its president from 2013 to October 2015 and was involved in launching a Committee of Vigilance Against Resurgent Fascism of which he is the current president.  Research  The work of Kees van der Pijl covers four main areas: a) transnational classes; b) the structure of the global political economy; c) the history of ideas in International Relations and Global Political Economy; d) modes of foreign relations. Transnational classes The study of transnational class formation was central in the work at the University of Amsterdam. It built on the writings of Christian Palloix, Nikos Poulantzas, Alfred Sohn-Rethel and on the materialist Cold War history in the United States (Joyce and Gabriel Kolko). Van der Pijl's contribution was on the transmission of American mass production to Western Europe in the Marshall Plan and the relegation of the cartelised European steel industry to the role of a supplier for the automobile industry, resulting in a first book in Dutch (1978). Economic statesmen involved in this process weld their different 'fractional' perspectives (heavy/light industrial, national/international trade, investment and commercial banking, etc.) into 'globale beheersconcepties' (comprehensive concepts of control, a notion coined by Ries Bode). A concept of control projects a presumed general interest totalising all others, under the guidance of the dominant fraction. In his doctoral dissertation of 1983 and the book based on it (The Making of an Atlantic Ruling Class, Verso 1984, reprinted with a new preface 2012), Van der Pijl applied this to the evolution of transatlantic class formation. In Transnational Classes and International Relations (Routledge 1998), neoliberalism is identified as the hegemonic concept of control in the closing decades of the 20th century. This book also analyses the managerial 'cadre', an auxiliary class of salaried functionaries with directive-educative roles. The cadre typically come to the fore in major crises (the 1930s, the 1970s, and again today), proposing managerial alternatives to liberalism. If not checked by popular mobilization, their intervention may assume authoritarian forms. Structure of the global political economy Challenging the state- centric understanding of world politics, which assumes that each state contains a self-enclosed society, van der Pijl distinguishes a Lockean heartland (after the ideologue of the 1688 Glorious Revolution in England) at the centre of the global political economy. This is composed of the white- majority, English-speaking countries. Its common law tradition favouring social self-regulation and distrust of state encroachment, ideology of possessive individualism, and missionary interpretation of its role in the world (inspired by Puritanism) have fostered the development of capitalist social relations. The Lockean heartland has interacted with rival states seeking to impose themselves on their societies, to balance and withstand the influence of the liberal West and avoid colonisation. These contender states, of which France in the long 18th century, Germany, Japan and Italy from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries, and the Soviet Union after World War II, have been the most important ones, develop through revolutions from above (Gramsci's ‚Äòpassive revolution‚Äô) into alternatives to transnational Western liberalism. This line of analysis, developed in Transnational Classes and International Relations and more recently in Global Rivalries from the Cold War to Iraq (Pluto and Sage-Vistaar 2006, Turkish trans., Imge 2014) leads to the identification of China as the current primary contender. History of international thought Building on the concepts of the Anglophone Lockean heartland and the contender states, Van der Pijl in Vordenker der Weltpolitik (Leske+Budrich 1996, revised from an earlier work in Dutch) argued that the liberal West typically produced 'idealist' conceptions of world order, against the 'realist' power politics perspective of the contenders. After World War I, there was an exodus of such 'realists' from the European continent to the United States, incorporating the realist argument into the IR mainstream. At Sussex, Van der Pijl has posted a web-textbook for the MA in Global Political Economy, 'A Survey of Global Political Economy'. In volumes II and III of his Modes of foreign relations project, Van der Pijl discusses what myth and religion say about foreign relations, and how liberalism prescribes the nation-state form for the world. The third volume, The Discipline of Western Supremacy (2014) presents a historical sociology of the IR discipline in this light. Modes of foreign relations In the Modes of foreign relations project, sponsored by the Leverhulme Trust under a major research fellowship 2006‚Äì2009, Van der Pijl argues that inter-state relations (as well as the national state form itself) are transient, historical forms of more fundamental foreign relations. Just as Marx developed a critique of equilibrium economics by claiming that this was only one ‚Äòmode of production‚Äô, which had been preceded and would be followed by others, Van der Pijl in this project challenges the 'IR' paradigm. Modes of foreign relations include a tribal, an empire/nomad, the sovereign equality, and the global governance modes; in each, a specific way occupation of space, its protection, and the exchange with others, are made possible by a given level of civilisation.  Controversy  Van der Pijl has claimed that Israelis brought down the Twin Towers during the 9/11 attacks 'with help from Zionists in the US government'.

Le Fauconnier was seen as one of the leading figures among the Montparnasse Cubists. At the 1911 Salon des Ind√©pendants Le Fauconnier and colleagues Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand L√©ger and Robert Delaunay caused a scandal with their Cubist paintings. He was in contacts with many European avant-garde artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, writing a theoretical text for the catalogue of the Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung in Munich, of which he became a member. His paintings were exhibited in Moscow reproduced as examples of the latest art in Der Blaue Reiter Almanach (The Blue Rider Almanac).Hermitage Amsterdam, Artist biographies, Henri Le Fauconnier Career Ploumanac‚Äôh, 1908, Bergen, Museum Kranenburgh In 1901 Henri Le Fauconnier moved from northern France to Paris, where he studied law, then attended painting classes in the studio of Jean- Paul Laurens, then in the Academie Julian. He changed his name from Fauconnier to Le Fauconnier and exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in 1904 and 1905, implementing bold colors in line with Henri Matisse. He moved to Brittany in 1907 and painted the rocky landscapes of Ploumanac'h in a proto-Cubist style characterized by chastened tones of brown and greens with thick outlines delimiting the simplified forms.

Built on the southwest corner of Fairhaven Avenue (formerly known as Fairview Avenue before mid-1920s) and Filbert Street near the top of the commanding heights overlooking to the east the sloping streets of the neighborhood of Curtis Bay, about four city blocks wide (east to west) and 15 blocks length (north to south). Further east beyond the residential area is a wide belt of a waterfront industrial zone with numerous railroad tracks / sidings and yard plus piers and industrial buildings/warehouses and one of the longest manufacturing assembly plant structures on East Coast of the United States, built in 1887 and massively expanded in 1916 for a railroad carwheel foundry associated with the infamous Pullman Company, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois and its \\"company town\\" on the southside of the second largest city in America of Pullman, Illinois. Begun by famous inventor and industrialist George Pullman (1831-1897), for building railway passenger cars, overnight sleeping cars, dining and cafe cars, etc., plus storage/shipping box cars, coal and iron ore cars, cabooses and other various types of rolling stock and their constituent parts required like steel wheels, axles, brake systems, wheel assemblies that were required and much of that industrial hardware for transportation were manufactured by the South Baltimore foundry company along what was named Curtis Avenue, just west of the waterfront piers, cranes and loading machines with conveyor belts alongside the interspaced rail tracks in Curtis Bay due to its recent new convenient extensions of lines of trackage to the south of old Baltimore City to the southwest areas alongside the outer Baltimore Harbor shorelines of the lower main stem of the Patapsco River and its cove (water body) of Curtis Bay on the southwest shores and its tributary streams of Curtis Creek, Marley Creek and Furnace Branch creek in adjacent rural northern Anne Arundel County. The new rail lines, yards, switching stations and bridges were installed in the early 1890s by the regional dominant line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, first rail passenger and freight line in the nation, begin in 1827-1828, over six decades before and now dominated the industry of the country. This was the inspiring view from the second story assembly hall of the new town hall of Curtis Bay overlooking the. burgeoning busy harbor and railroads documented in a two foot long panoramic fold-out printed photograph in a descriptive booklet phamplet on the attributes for residences and industrial possibilities published in 1917 by Curtis Bay Terraces, Inc., a land development subsidiary of the longtime landowners, the South Baltimore Harbor and Improvement Company, seeking to add additional houses on the streets it had laid out on the higher hills to the west overlooking the original three-block wide street grid plat of the late 1880s of the predecessor developers known as the Patapsco Land Company of Baltimore City. This firm had been reorganized in 1874 from the earlier Patapsco Company of the 1850s pre-American Civil War developers of local Anne Arundel farmers and land owners combined with city financiers, businessmen, and a few far-seeing politicians who established and laid out the nearby town of Brooklyn, along the north-south road, (one of two parallel Baltimore- Annapolis thoroughfares of dirt/gravel) from the state capital and county seat of Annapolis, 20 miles south, towards Baltimore to the north. The new Brooklyn town, named after the similarly sited predecessor city of Brooklyn, New York, founded in the 17th century, it too named for an earlier Dutch city in the Netherlands in Europe. The Maryland Brooklyn was two miles to the northwest from the cove / river inlet Curtis Bay in 1853, 34 years earlier along the south and east shores of the Ferry Branch (now Middle Branch) of the Patapsco River, on the northern reaches of Anne Arundel County, second oldest in the state and also directly south of the city established and laid out in 1729, and the county seat for then surrounding Baltimore County created in 1659. The new village of Brooklyn was connected by a mile-long wooden trestle span, the Light Street Bridge (or also known as the Long Bridge or Brooklyn Bridge). Constructed in 1856, three years after the town and replaced the earlier ferry since colonial times, which unfortunately charged tolls considered too high and expensive, and also provided easy road access to Curtis Bay and by 1895, an electric streetcar service. The Curtis Bay Town Hall of 1905/1909 (and later Polish Home Hall by 1925) is a large two-story (with a third story attic under a sloping shingle roof), structure of masonry / dark red brick with stone trim, of vernacular Beaux-Arts architectural style building bearing classical features and symmetry. It was constructed about 1905 as the town hall, real estate/developers offices, volunteer fire company station, and a meeting/assembly hall on the large second floor for the small community of Curtis Bay within the southern limits of the City of Baltimore, to which it was absorbed in the third major annexation in municipal history in January 1919, from adjoining northern Anne Arundel County as the city also expanded in the other three directions - north, east and west into surrounding Baltimore County also. In 1925, the United Polish Societies purchased the building from the developing firm of the South Baltimore Harbor and Improvement Company and renamed it Polish Home Hall and it became central to the increasing Polish immigrant influx experience in Curtis Bay which had been flooding in along with large numbers of other Eastern European nationalities coming in from overseas through the Locust Point immigration station and piers for the B.&O.; Railroad and their connections with the North German Lloyd shipping line in Bremen and Hamburg, the second largest immigration station in the United States, next to New Yorks Ellis Island, since the early 1900s, This added tremendously to the original heavily Anglo-English and German residents originally predominating since the town's founding in the late 1880s. Curtis Bay underwent a radical transformation and evolved and grew quite differently from more \\"Americanized\\" residential suburb of nearby Brooklyn, with much less industrial and port / railroad development. The newly acquired Polish Home Hall soon functioned as a social, educational, and political center for Curtis Bay's growing expanding Polish community (along with several other East European peoples attracted to the same community of neighboring Slavic immigrants, with the second largest numbers of Poles and others in a Baltimore neighborhood besides near Fells Point and adjacent Canton or Highlandtown communities, further northeast across the Patapsco River / Baltimore Harbor in the southeast part of the city, which remained heavily ethnic Polish into the 1970s. After 102 years of over a century of little appreciation and recognition, the Polish Home Hall in Curtis Bay was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, maintained by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2007.

It was to be a \\"model\\" for all other schools in the district, and the thirteenth of its kind. On 22 December 1879, Prof. John Perry, president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, highlighted the Belfast Model as an example to be followed in a proposed reform of technical education in England. During riots and arson attacks surrounding the consideration of the Anglo- Irish Treaty in May 1922, the Divis Street premises were burned down. Premises were purchased in Cliftonville Road and classes resumed in Cliftonville Lodge, until a new building was opened in 1937. The Belfast Model remained on Cliftonville Road until implementation in 1954 of the Tripartite System, under the Education Act (Northern Ireland) 1947, caused the school to split into separate boys' and girls' schools. The Belfast Boys' Model School began operations in Ballysillan Road in 1957, while the Cliftonville Road premises became the site of present-day Cliftonville Integrated Primary School.

They pledged \\"to work and to advance pictorial photography and to show our own Australia in terms of sunlight rather than those of greyness and dismal shadows\\".Harold Cazneaux letter to Jack Cato, National Library of Australia Manuscript MS 5416 He also contributed lectures and technical demonstrations to the New South Wales Photographic Society.Gael Newton \\"Silver and Grey: fifty years of Australian photography 1900 ‚Äì 1950\\", Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1980  Sydney Harbour Bridge  He is best known for his documentation of the Australian icon Sydney Harbour Bridge between the late 1920s to the early 1930s. Photographing from precarious vantage points on the bridge itself, sometimes a hundred metres above Sydney Harbour, his work sets the construction against the harbour and the growing city and uses the figures of the workers to represent the scale of this Depression-era engineering feat.see page 176‚Äì178 Intersections: Photography, History and the National Library of Australia, Helen Ennis, National Library of Australia, 2004. , . 277 pages His pictures and film of the Bridge were an intentional historical document and the project was self-generated. Between 1930 and 1932, he produced hundreds of stills and film footage.The Construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, film by Mallard, Henri. ; Litchfield, Frank.[Sydney] : Institution of Engineers, Australia, Sydney Division, [1995]. Prior to his project to document the Bridge, Mallard worked in the Pictorialist style prevailing in the New South Wales Photographic Society, and though Modernist in composition and design, many of the Bridge images are printed in bromoil. By comparison, Harold Cazneaux's contemporaneous photographs, taken from around the base of the bridge, retain a romantic Pictorialism.  Recognition  In 1976 the Australian Centre for Photography commissioned David Moore (1927‚Äì2003) to make an archive of gelatin silver prints from the collection of Mallard's glass negatives and these were published in association with Sun Books in 1978. > ‚ÄúHere we have the documentary photograph, radical enough in its context, the > social document, a large slice of Sydney's evolution and an example to all > of us who think of future generations in terms of historical narration.\\" Max > DupainBuilding the Sydney Harbour Bridge / photographer: Henri Mallard ; > introduced by Max Dupain and Howard Tanner.

The festival was owned by John Jackson and Kilimanjaro Live. It was jointly promoted by K2 and Kilimanjaro Live. It hosted heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Slayer, Judas Priest, Megadeth and Avenged Sevenfold. The festival has not taken place in the UK since 2014. Stuart Galbraith, CEO of Kilimanjaro Live, revealed in 2018 that Sonisphere will not return to the UK, due to financial issues.  Event history  The idea for Sonisphere was first conceived by John Jackson in the late 90s. Jackson chose the name Sonisphere, from a combination of Sonic and Sphere. In 2008 Stuart Galbraith had formed business partnership with AEG Live called Kilimanjaro Live. John Jackson approached Stuart Galbraith with the idea of a pan-world touring festival that aligned with Kilimanjaro Live's plan for a UK festival. John Jackson is the Creator and Director of Sonisphere and Galbraith the Producer. The first run of festivals ran throughout the summer of 2009 at six venues, returning in 2010 and 2011 with 11 venues. Plans for future festivals consist of increasing the number of festivals, making the event global rather than local to Europe, expanding the UK event into a 3-day festival, and increasing the UK capacity from 40,000 to 60,000 attendees.  Sonisphere 2009  The 2009 Sonisphere festival tour was made up of six one-day festivals across Europe with a seventh festival in England spanning two days. The festival had a core group of bands that played each of the six dates with numerous extra bands added to each date individually. The locations for the 2009 festivals include Goffert Park, Nijmegen, Netherlands; Hockenheimring, Germany; The Forum, Barcelona, Spain; Folkets Park, Hultsfred, Sweden; Kirjurinluoto, Pori, Finland; and Knebworth House, Knebworth, England. Metallica were the main headliners for each of the 2009 Sonisphere Festivals.

England  The British edition of the Sonisphere Festival took place over two days, on Saturday 1 and Sunday 2 August 2009, at Knebworth House, Knebworth with headliners Linkin Park (Saturday) and Metallica (Sunday). The festival featured four stages of music over the weekend, with the main two being staggered staging, the others being within the Bohemia village. The Bohemia stage (the third of four stages) was an undercover stage and was able to continue past the sound curfews placed upon the main stages. This was The Rev's final live performance as Avenged Sevenfold's drummer before his death in December 2009. It was also the last European appearance of Ronnie James Dio before he died of stomach cancer in May 2010. * Avenged Sevenfold played their final concert with The Rev before his passing on December 28, 2009. The band's final song together was Almost Easy. *Dead by Sunrise appeared on the Apollo Stage on the Saturday night as part of Linkin Park's encore. * Coheed and Cambria were late arriving, due to them missing their ferry and as such were moved onto the Bohemia stage to play a later slot originally intended for the band FACT. As such, FACT played the Apollo stage. * Lamb of God's guitarist Mark Morton missed the band's slot on 2 August as his wife was due to give birth around that time. Unearth's Buz McGrath filled in for him for the band's show at Sonisphere UK. * Nine Inch Nails performance was said to be their last ever in Europe as they were set to stop touring at the end of that tour after 20 years.

He presented his own series on Dublin on RT√â (Irish National Broadcaster) during the 1970s and was well known for guided tours and lectures of his beloved Dublin. He is buried in Dublin's Glasnevin Cemetery, next to Frank Ryan. Biography MacThom√°is came from a staunch Republican family. He was born Edward Patrick Thomas in the Dublin suburb of Rathmines. His father, a fire-brigade officer, died when √âamonn was five years old and his family moved to Goldenbridge, Inchicore. He left school at 13 to work as delivery boy for White Heather Laundry, learning Dublin neighbourhoods with great thoroughness. He said he found work to help his mother pay the rent. He later worked as a clerk, and was appointed credit controller for an engineering firm. MacThom√°is joined the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Republican Army as a young man and was active in the preparations for and prosecution of the 1956-62 border campaign. He was interned in Curragh Camp during the campaign and in December 1961 was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment under the Offences Against the State Act. At the November 1959 Ardfheis he was elected to the Ardchomhairle of Sinn F√©in, and edited and contributed to the Sinn F√©in newspaper The United Irishman. He was a close friend of Tom√°s MacGiolla, and was deeply affected by the 1970 split in Sinn F√©in. MacThom√°is took the Provisional side, opposing MacGiolla.The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party He took over as editor of An Phoblacht in 1972. In July 1973, he was arrested and charged with IRA membership at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin. He refused to recognise the court but he gave a lengthy address from the dock. The following month he was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment. Within two months of completing his sentence he was again before the court on the same charge and received a 15-month sentence. Editors of six left-wing and Irish-language journals called for his release, as did a number of writers, and hundreds attended protest meetings - to no avail. He served his full sentence. Tim Pat Coogan who was editor of the Irish Press claimed the charges against MacThom√°is were politically motivated to a large degree as his activities were confined strictly to the newspaper An Phoblacht.Coogan, Tim Pat. The I.R.A., p. 422 Under Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, due to his membership of Sinn F√©in in the 1970s he was removed from his position in making some of the RT√â historical programmes. As a historian he made numerous contributions to various historical publications such as the Dublin Historical Review.General Index to Dublin Historical Record, Old Dublin Society (2007) From 1974 he wrote a number of books on old Dublin. They sold well and remained in print for over 20 years. He also started a number of walking tours of Dublin, which proved very popular. He died in 2002. His son Shane, also a historian, ran similar walking tours and was resident historian at Glasnevin cemetery before his death in 2014.

They are one of the oldest in Boston. History Kerry was one of the first clubs formed in Boston, along with the Galway Club. Early history of the club is omitted. Kerry enjoyed early success; they were New England Champions in 1928. Kerry's Jim Sullivan came to Boston in 1927 after winning two All-Ireland Medals at home. He played with Kerry Boston for a number of years. Depression and wars affected the games. All-Ireland Champions, Mayo visited Boston in 1937 and played a Boston selection, which included Kerry's Jim Sullivan, Johnny Quirke and Michael Dalton from the Kerry Club. Football was at a low ebb during World War II until things started back up in 1947. John Twomey spearheaded the club during this era. The team picture from 1949 shows many of the players that made up the 1947 team. According to the older members of the club, challenge games were played in 1947 but no championship. Kerry continued to thrive during the 1950s and started the 1960s with another championship success in 1960. A notable event in the '50s was the formation of the St. John's Club by a few of the Kerry players. The St. John's Club folded after three years. In speaking to one of the former greats of the Kerry Boston scene, he recalled being paid $15.00 a game by the Galway Football Club during the early 1950s. In 1960 a number of players came from Ireland to live in Boston, John and Mickey Teahan, John Flynn, Gerry Lynch, Sean Garvey, Tim McGillicuddy, John Nash, Frank Donoghue, Jim Maunsell and Joe Courtney, winning the Championship the same year. However, the Kerry team was beaten in 1961 as some of the players were in the Army. The Kerry Club had another championship in 1963. The club's success in the 1960s was spurred by a new wave of immigrants. Kerry won the 1974 championship on objection. Kerry won with the great players like Pete Nash, Kieran Whelan, Oliver Briody, John Loftus, P.J. Shaughnessy, Joe Maunsell and Joe Driscoll. The success of the club in the '70s and '80s was lean in comparison to the standards reached in the 1990s. Kerry competed in five Senior Championships in the '90s, winning three. Over the same time span the club won two Junior Championships. The Kingdom's dominance of the Boston scene was reflected on two occasions in 1993 and again 1996 when they claimed the Senior/Junior double. On both occasions, Mike Christy O'Connor was the manager of the Senior team. He is the only manager since 1963 to lead his team to a Senior title on the field, without winning by objection. He still holds this distinction today. Senior Championship wins: 1993, 1996 and 1999 Junior Championship wins: 1993, and 1996 In 1997 the club became the first club in the North American Board history to field three teams, competing in Senior, Intermediate and Junior. With the turn of the new millennium the club continues to thrive in Boston. In 2002 the Kerry club of Boston won the Intermediate Championship in Boston, and only losing by the narrowest of margins (1 point) in the North American Final in Gaelic Park in Chicago. The following year (2003) the club went on to win the North American Junior B title. The Kerry Club won both the Northeast Intermediate Championship and Northeast Junior B Championship in 2007, which saw Kerry's Junior squad go all the way to the North American final with the likes of Carol O'Connell, Sean Pete O'Sullivan, Ger Barry, Dan O'Connor, Timmy O'Neill, Mike Moriarty and Chris O'Connor leading the way. The Intermediate side which featured players like Bernard O'Connor, Johnny Maroney, Jonathan o Donnell, Mike Godley, and John McGrath made it to the semi-final but were defeated in a tough competition against the Sons of Boru from San Francisco. The Kerry club competed in Junior A and Intermediate football in 2008. The Juniors lost in the Boston semi-final to the Aiden McAnespies. The Intermediate squad lost in the Boston final to Galway but met the same Galway team in the North American final and claimed the title. It was the first time Kerry Boston had ever won a North American Intermediate Crown. In 2009, the Senior team made it to an Intermediate Semi-final but were badly beaten by the Connemara Gaels while the Junior team didn't qualify for the playoffs.

The term \\"armyworm\\" can refer to several species, often describing the large-scale invasive behavior of the species' larval stage. It is regarded as a pest and can damage and destroy a wide variety of crops, which causes large economic damage. Its scientific name derives from frugiperda, which is Latin for lost fruit, named because of the species' ability to destroy crops. Because of its propensity for destruction, the fall armyworm's habits and possibilities for crop protection have been studied in depth. It is also a notable case for studying sympatric speciation, as it appears to be diverging into two species currently. Another remarkable trait of the larva is that they practice cannibalism. The fall armyworm is active at a different time of year from the true armyworm, another species in the order Lepidoptera and family Noctuidae, but of the genus Mythimna. Outbreaks of the true armyworm usually occur during the early part of the summer; the fall armyworm does most damage in the late summer in the southern part of the United States, and early fall in the northern regions.  Description  Illustration The adult moths are 32 to 40 mm wing tip to wing tip, with a brown or gray forewing, and a white hindwing. There is slight sexual dimorphism, with males having more patterns and a distinct white spot on each of their forewings. The first larval instar is light colored with a larger dark head. As they develop through instars, they become browner with white lengthwise lines. They also develop dark spots with spines.  Geographic range  The fall armyworm is widely distributed in eastern and central North America and in South America. It has been invasive in Africa since 2016. It cannot overwinter in below freezing temperatures,Mur√∫a MG et al. (2009) Natural distribution of parasitoids of larvae of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, in Argentina Journal of Insect Science 9(20) so it only survives the winter in the most southern regions of the United States, namely Texas and Florida. Because of this, the fall armyworm is a more prominent pest in southeastern states. However, seasonally it will spread across the eastern United States and up to southern Canada, inhabiting areas with suitable food supplies. The potential global distribution of S. frugiperda has been modelled using CLIMEX. The modelled global potential distribution reflects the marked seasonal range dynamics experienced in North America, with much of the potential range in Europe, South Africa, China and Australia consisting of habitat that is only climatically suitable during the warmer months. Invasive spread It was first reported in Africa in 2016, where it is causing significant damage to maize crops and has great potential for further spread and economic damage.https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/29810 It has since spread to 28 countries in Africa. In 2018, it began to spread widely in India. In January 2019, a heavy infestation of fall armyworm was recorded in corn plantations of Sri Lanka The pest was first detected in China in the southwest province of Yunnan in January 2019. Through 2019, the pest infested a total of 26 provinces. The armyworm is expected in 2020 to hit China's Northeast wheat belt. A report issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs rates the situation as \\"very grave\\". In February 2020 S. frugiperda was detected in Queensland, Australia. It was observed in traps baited with a male pheromone lure, firstly on Erub and Saibai islands in the Torres Strait, and subsequently on the mainland near Croyden. Within a week it was officially declared ineradicable. In April 2020, it was then detected in Papua New Guinea, spreading through the Torres Strait.  Food resources   Caterpillars  Witch hazel The armyworm's diet consists mainly of grasses and small-grain crops such as corn, but the species has been noted to consume over 80 different plants. Armyworms earned their common name by eating all plant matter they encounter in their wide dispersals, like a large army. A few sweet corn varieties have partial, but not complete, resistance to armyworms. The resistance comes from a unique 33-kD proteinase that the corn produces when it is being fed on by fall armyworms or other larva. This protein was found to significantly decrease fall armyworm larva growth. = Cannibalism = When possible, larva will cannibalize the larva of smaller instars. A 1999 study showed that cannibalism only benefits the caterpillar when other food is scarce. Despite this, the caterpillars will cannibalize others whenever they can, even though it was found to decrease their own fitness in many cases. One known reason why cannibalism is detrimental to the fall armyworm is because of disease transmission to the cannibal. In nature, the negative effects of cannibalism may be balanced by the fact that cannibalism removes competitors, thereby making more resources accessible and indirectly increasing fall armyworms' fitness.  Adults  Adult moths sip nectar from flowers such as that of witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana).  Life history  The fall armyworm's life cycle is completed within 30 days during summer, and 60 days during the spring and autumn seasons; during the winter, these caterpillars' life cycle lasts about 80 to 90 days.[3] The number of generations a moth will have in a year varies based on climate, but in her life span a female will typically lay about 1,500 eggs. Because larva cannot enter into diapause they cannot survive cold temperatures.  Egg  The armyworm's egg is dome-shaped, and measures around 0.4 mm in diameter and 0.3 mm in height. Females prefer to lay eggs on the underside of leaves, but in high populations they will lay them just about anywhere. In warm weather, the eggs will hatch into larvae within a few days.  Larva  The larva go through six different instars, each varying slightly in physical appearance and pattern. The larva process lasts from 14 to 30 days, again depending on temperatures. The mature caterpillar is about 1.5‚Äì2.0 inches (38‚Äì51 mm) in length. This is the most destructive life stage as the larvae have biting mouth parts. The larvae have a distinctive inverted Y suture on the forehead.  Pupa  The larva then pupate underground for 7 to 37 days in a cocoon they form of soil and silk. Duration and survival of the pupal stage depend on the temperature of the environment.  Adults  Once emerged, the adults live for about 10 days, and sometimes up to 21 days, with the female laying most of her eggs early in life. Adults are nocturnal and fare best during warm and humid nights.  Migration  Adults are capable of flying long distances, so even though they are unable to overwinter north of the southern region of the United States, the moths can migrate as far north as southern Canada in warm months. Their migration rate is remarkably fast, estimated at 300 miles per generation. Some scientists speculate that this fast migration is aided by the movement of air in weather fronts.  Enemies   Predators  Fall armyworm caterpillars are directly preyed upon by many invertebrates and vertebrates. Common predators include birds, rodents, beetles, earwigs, and other insects. It has been shown that direct predation can cause significant losses to caterpillar populations. The larva's main defense against enemies is their ability to reach large numbers and migrate before seasonal conditions are suitable for predators.  Parasitoids  Fly and wasp parasitoids target the fall armyworm, most commonly Archytas marmoratus, Cotesia marginiventris, and Chelonus texanus. The armyworm is also vulnerable to additional parasitoids, varying with location. In 2018, egg parasitoid wasps of the genera Telenomus and Trichogramma were discovered to attack army worm eggs in East Africa.  Parasites and disease  Fifty-three different parasite species have been discovered in fall armyworm larvae, spanning ten different families. Often larvae can survive through much of their crop consumption despite outbreaks of disease, because of the larva's fast life cycle. Despite this, parasites of the fall armyworm are being studied extensively as a means of fighting armyworm attacks on crops. One suggested approach would be to introduce parasites from South America to North American fall armyworms, and vice versa.  Subspecies  The fall armyworm may be presently undergoing a divergence into two separate species. These two strains have major genetic differences that are connected to the plants they feed on, even though both still exist in the same area (sympatric speciation). These two strains can be loosely categorized into a rice strain and a corn strain. This separation is occurring because of differences in habitat (preferred host plant), and differences in reproductive behavior. The reproductive differences can be divided into two causes: difference in the timing of mating at night, and difference in female sex pheromones.  Mating   Mate searching behavior and male‚Äìmale conflict  A female attracts males by perching atop the host plant feeding area and releasing a sex pheromone as the signal that she wishes to mate. The pheromone has been studied and found to contain the components Z7-12 and Z9-14. Each female only mates once per night; this creates a physical conflict between the multiple males that will fly towards a ready female. There is an order to which the females call and mate: virgin females do first, females who have mated once next, and females who have already mated multiple times call and mate last during the night.  Interactions with humans   Pest of crop plants  Because of their food preferences, fall armyworm larvae can wreak havoc on a wide range of crops. The first historical account of the fall armyworm's destruction was in 1797 in Georgia. Destruction can happen almost over night, because the first stages of a caterpillar's life require very little food, and the later stages require about 50 times more. Because of this rapid change in food consumption, the presence of larva will not be noticed until they have destroyed almost everything in as little as a night. Some examples of targeted crops include cotton, tobacco, sweet corn, rice, peanuts, and even fruits such as apples, oranges, and many more. The list of possible food sources for the worms is extensive, so crop damage is wide-ranging. It is estimated that almost 40 percent of those species that armyworms target are economically important. Because the larva eat so much of the plant, they are very detrimental to crop survival and yield. In corn, larvae will even burrow into the corn ear to eat the kernels. = Invasive presence in Africa = The fall armyworm was identified in Africa in 2016. In early 2017, armyworms infested large swathes of corn crops across southern Africa, devastating the livelihood of many farmers. It is thought they arrived as an invasive species from the Americas as eggs in imported produce. This is causing immense concern among agricultural experts, due to the potentially huge amount of damage this invasive species will do to African food crops if allowed to spread. Many African countries have agreed to take urgent actions against armyworms. = Management of pest = The CABI-led programme, Plantwise and partners have several recommendations for managing fall armyworm, these include; planting early, avoiding staggered planting, intercropping with crops that aren't susceptible to fall armyworm such as cassava or yam. They also recommend conserving shelters and flowering plants on the edges for beneficial insects such as ground beetles and parasitoids. Intercropping with the 'push-pull' technique with crops such as Desmodium and Napier grass can be used to control fall armyworm. For some crops including wheat, sorghum, millet and rice it is recommend by Plantwise partners to plant short maturing and varieties that are less preferred by S. frugiperda.  Responses  Because of the fall armyworms' great destructive power, farmers must go to great lengths to deter the larvae. Insecticide is a widely used form of protection; in southern regions, farmers may have to apply insecticide to corn every day. Another strategy is to plant crops earlier to avoid the increase in armyworm numbers as the summer progresses. In South Africa, farmers are using pheromone lures with a combination of Dichlorvos blocks to trap and eliminate male armyworms with the intention of disrupting mating cycles.  Research use  S. frugiperda cells (Sf9 and Sf21 cell lines) are commonly used in biomedical research for the purpose of recombinant protein expression using insect- specific viruses called baculoviruses. Invasion of Sri Lanka First reported in India in May 2018, from Tamil Nadu, Ministry of Agriculture of Sri Lanka issued a warning notice to farmers in the northwestern and north central provinces about possible fall armyworm invasion. At the time of warning, crop destruction had already been reported from the Ampara, Anuradhapura, and Polonnaruwa areas. The moth is known among local people as Sena dalambuwa (armyworm caterpillar). Not only corn, but also sugarcane plantations were attacked by the caterpillars in Anuradhapura, Ampara, and Monaragala districts. In December 2018, heavy infestations in corn cultivation were identified. The spreading of the moth leads to attack corn all around the country within weeks. On 6 January 2019, caterpillars spread to Monaragala district and devastated corn crops. At the end of January 2019, the armyworm is present in all districts of Sri Lanka except Nuwara Eliya and Jaffna. The Sri Lankan Department of Agriculture recommended 12 pesticides under three categories, to be used alternatively in every seven days. Organic farming expert, Thilak Kandegama said that the threat can be overcome by sprinkling ashes as a repellent. Agricultural Ministry also decided to use drone technology for the spraying of insecticides to control the spreading of caterpillars. On 29 December 2018, armyworms were recorded from paddy cultivations in the Sinhapura area of Polonnaruwa. In January 2019, caterpillars were also recorded from paddy cultivations of Nochchiyagama area in Anuradhapura district.  Agricultural drones  The agriculture drone developed by XAG has a spraying efficiency of 14 hectares per hour, which can attack the infected farmland and kill pests on a large scale, thus reducing the degree of moth migration. The agriculture drone has a special atomisation spraying mechanism, micron-level droplets and powerful downdraft, is designed to achieve uniform applications of ultralow-volume pesticides. Both sides of the leaves and the central part of crops, where the pests conceal themselves, can be more precisely targeted. This not only increases fall armyworm's exposure to chemicals but also cuts down 30% pesticide use and 90% agricultural water. At present, this technology has been extended from China to Vietnam, Zambia and other regions.

As production increases, the opportunity cost does as well. The best way to look at this is to review an example of an economy that only produces two things - cars and oranges. If all the resources of the economy are put into producing only oranges, there will not be any factors of production available to produce cars. So the result is an output of X number of oranges but 0 cars. The reverse is also true - if all the factors of production are used for the production of cars, 0 oranges will be produced. In between these two extremes are situations where some oranges and some cars are produced. There are three assumptions that are made in this possibility. The economy is experiencing full employment (everyone who wants to work has a job), the best technology is being used and production efficiency is being maximized. So the question becomes, what is the cost of producing more oranges or cars? If the economy is at the maximum for all inputs, then the cost of each unit will be more expensive. The economy will have to incur more variable costs, such as overtime, to produce the unit. The law also applies to switching production in a maxed out economy. Essentially, the economy is still producing more, so the law still applies. The only difference is that resources are being taken from one area and applied to another, instead of simply producing more of the same (as assumed in the first paragraph) References Category:Economics laws ","title":"Law of increasing costs"},{"id":"21561306","text":"PrƒÖdy is a settlement in the administrative district of Gmina Czarne, within Cz≈Çuch√≥w County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

History Vinten, then trading as 'W. Vinten Cinematograph Engineers', was formally founded by William Vinten in 1910 and was originally based at 89-91 Wardour Street, London. The company began in 1909 by manufacturing Kinemacolor projectors for Charles Urban. Retrieved 03-2009 In 1914, the company workshops were taken over by the government and Vinten were invited by Sopwith at Kingston upon Thames to work alongside them in their aeroplane factory. This led in 1915 to an invitation by the Royal Flying Corps for William Vinten to design and build a special cine-camera for use in aircraft. Vinten developed the Model B - the first cine-camera that could be operated while hung over the side of an aircraft and as a result began to work in close co-operation with both the military and the film industry. In 1928 Vinten expanded and moved to Cricklewood, North London, mainly supplying the film industry by creating specialised equipment for companies such as Kodak. By 1937 around three-quarters of all films shown in Britain were processed using equipment developed by Vinten. The company also had a strong presence in creating both sound and production equipment. The Second World War created an increased requirement for reconnaissance cameras and military contracts secured world market presence for reconnaissance work. In the late 1940s, the broadcast market began to flourish and Vinten developed the first telerecording camera. As a result the British Broadcasting Corporation became increasingly involved with Vinten. The BBC became the world benchmark for whom Vinten adapted many of their original film camera supports creating equipment more suitable for television cameras.Images of Success, Samson and Vinten, 1993, Wolsey Press Ltd In 1964 Vinten moved to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. In 1972, Vinten was floated on the London Stock Exchange. Vinten robotic camera control at Al Jazeera studios in London In the early 1980s Vinten began to develop remote control TV systems early in conjunction with the BBC for use in their main N1, N2 and N3 news studios. Shortly after this a second venture was undertaken with the Saskatchewan Legislature, using the system to televise State governmental proceedings. In 1984 the company changed its name to Vinten Group plc. In 1988 Vinten split into two separate entities. W Vinten Ltd (now Thales Optronics Ltd) focused solely on reconnaissance equipment and moved into new premises. Vinten Broadcast Ltd remained on the same site, concentrating on broadcast mounting equipment. From 1989 Vinten Group began a series of acquisitions: Manfrotto (1989), Bexel (1991), Gitzo (1992), Bogen Imaging (1993), TSM Inc [known for its AutoCam product range] (1993), Sachtler (1995), OConnor (2003). Vinten Group plc changed its name to Vitec Group plc in 1995, but the Vinten name continued as Vinten Broadcast Ltd remained as part of the group. Following the acquisition of Radamec in 2003 a new brand Vinten Radamec was created to take over the manufacture of robotic camera support products. Vinten continues to be a manufacturer of lightweight manual and robotic camera supports such as tripods, pedestals, pan and tilt heads, robotic heads, and robotic tracks, many of which are aimed at the television studio and outside broadcast markets. MDR Notable Vinten Products Vinten HP 419 The Vinten HP 419 'Hydro-Pneumatic'gas-balanced pedestal was launched in the 1950s. The pedestal enabled TV cameramen to track and jib all at the same time without losing sight of the viewfinder. Many thousands of the HP 419 design were sold worldwide. Very few remain in production use, often replaced by the later Vinten Fulmar. Vinten Mk 3 The Vinten Mk 3 Pan & Tilt head used risers and cams to maintain the centre of gravity. This made the tilting of heavy cameras considerably easier and if correctly mounted a camera could be left at any tilt angle without lock off. The design (by William Vinten's son Bill) was highly innovative for the time. Retrieved 07-2009 Vinten OB Dolly In the late 1950s Vinten's received a request via the BBC from the Queen. She asked for a less intrusive dolly to be used at Sandringham during the filming of the Royal Christmas Message. The Vinten Outside Broadcasting Dolly was designed to fulfill this requirement. The dolly, which ran on solid or pneumatic tyres, was quite narrow so it could be wheeled easily along a narrow passage or through a royal living room.Retrieved 07-2009 Vinten Plover The Vinten Plover was a compact and relatively lightweight nitrogen-balanced studio/OB pedestal using a central three-stage column and three sets of linked wheels which could be either pneumatic or solid. The centre column could be separated from the wheeled base for transportation. Vinten Fulmar The Vinten Fulmar was a studio pedestal featuring a three-stage column. Renowned for its smooth movement and robust design the Fulmar can still be found in studios worldwide despite being discontinued for many years. Vinten Vector Launched on 1993, the Vinten Vector range of pan and tilt heads are used for television studios and outside broadcast television production. The first Vector head, the Vector 70, was famous for its unique pantographic counterbalance mechanism that allowed heavy broadcast cameras to be balanced without the use of interchangeable cams. The Vector 700 and Vector 750, developed from the Vector 70, can be seen in use at nearly all major broadcasting events. Vinten Vision The Vinten Vision range of pan & tilt heads are used for lightweight cameras and camcorders. Vinten Quattro The Vinten Quattro pedestal range was introduced in 1996 and features a four-stage column design that provides an on-shot stroke of 100 cm/39.4\\". The pedestal is now available in three versions: studio, outside broadcast and compact studio.Retrieved 07-2009 Vinten Vision blueBridge By raising the centre of gravity of the camera sitting on a Vision blue head, the Vinten Vision blueBridge deliver balance to lightweight DSLRs from just 1.5 kg/3.3lbs. Vinten Family Four out of William and Ellen Vinten's five (Charles, Maisie Johnson, Jean Crosher, Phyllis (Pip) Norris and Bill) children worked for the company at some time. His two sons, Charles and Bill, inherited his engineering abilities and enthusiasm for technology and each became a nucleus for one of the company's two main activities: Charles focused on reconnaissance and Bill focused on television. Bill Vinten OBE was trained as a cameraman and, like his father, was a keen inventor who was responsible for the development of many of the notable products mentioned above. He was awarded the 'Technical Achievement Award' from the Society of Camera Operators for his work on the Fulmar pedestal. The last formal link between the Vinten Group and the Vinten family ended when Bill Vinten resigned from the group board in September 1992 at the age of 72, having worked in the company for 43 years. Bill Vinten still continued to take an interest in the company until his death on November 11, 2015. In his will he left a legacy to the trust (below). The William & Ellen Vinten Trust was founded by Jean Crosher, the 3rd child of William and Ellen Vinten, to provide charitable donations to further the education and training of Vinten employees and people in the local area. Although Jean was never employed by Vinten she too was very much involved in the decisions taken by the family prior to it becoming a public company. In 1993 Stuart Sansom and Bill Vinten's son, Luke wrote 'Images of Success', a book about the history of Vinten.

It was approved by the International Council on Archives (ICA/CIA) as an international framework standard to register archival documents produced by corporations, persons and families. Description ISAD(G) defines a list of elements and rules for the description of archives and describes the kinds of information that must and should be included in such descriptions. It creates a hierarchy of description that determines what information should be included at what level. ISAD(G) follows four general principles: # Description begins at the general information and then goes to the specific information # Any information provided should correspond to the level of description # Descriptions should be linked between levels # There should be no repetitions of information in the descriptions ISAD(G) defines 26 data elements of description, six of which are mandatory: # Reference code: a unique identifier that links to the description # Title: the name of the record # Name of Creator: the entity or individual that created or cultivated the record # Date(s) of Creation # Extent of the Unit of Description # Level of description The standard provides a framework for a common approach, rather than a rigid format. History Previously it had been difficult to access repositories around the world due to the inconsistent description practices among different archives. The need for standardization of archival descriptions became apparent. After initial activities since 1988 supported by UNESCO, a subgroup of the AdHoc Commission on Descriptive Standards discussed the first draft of these standards beginning in 1990. The first version of ISAD(G) was released and adopted by the ICA in 1994. In 1999, an evaluation of ISAD(G) was conducted in order to determine its effectiveness of describing datasets and to evaluate how it had been being used in data archives. After lengthy research and evaluation, the ICA published a revised version, the second edition, in 2000. Sometimes abbreviated as ISAD(G)2, the revised version remains the current standard today. ISAD(G) has been adopted as a standard by various members. In the United States, for example, the local implementation of ISAD(G) is Describing Archives: A Content Standard (2006).

History Lighting-up time was first introduced in the nineteenth century in local by-laws and enforced nationally by the Lights on Vehicles Act 1907. In the 1920s, service stations started displaying cardboard clock-face displays, set to the lighting-up time for the day. The Road Lighting Act 1942 stipulated 1 hour after sunset/before sunrise. It was amended to 30 minutes by the Road Traffic Act 1956 because of the increasing speed of traffic. These were the required times for showing all lights on all vehicles, including bicycles and horse-drawn carts, hence the name lighting-up time. The (still current) Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 tightened the requirements further. Lighting-up time is retained as the required period for use of motor vehicle headlights on roads without lit streetlights, but with that exception, all vehicles must now keep conspicuity lights lit during the longer period of sunset to sunrise (unless parked, in a designated parking place and facing the same way as adjacent traffic and more than from the nearest junction on a road with a speed limit not exceeding Note: This exemption only applies for \\"a motor vehicle being a goods vehicle the unladen weight of which does not exceed 1525 kg;\\".s. 24 of The Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989 and the Highway Code). The conspicuity lights required are \\"front and rear position lamps\\" (side and tail lights) plus, for large vehicles, side marker lamps and end-outline marker lamps and, for motor vehicles, rear number plate lights. Different rules apply to bicycles; RVLR states that \\"Lights (and reflectors) are required on a pedal cycle only between sunset and sunrise. Lights (and reflectors) are not required when the cycle is stationary or being pushed along the roadside. When they are required, the lights and reflectors listed below must be clean and working properly.\\" Headlights are also required at other times when visibility is restricted, e.g. by fog, rain, snow, overcast sky or smoke. They should also be used in tunnels. Streetlights are usually set to come on automatically near the beginning of lighting-up time, although modern lamps monitor the light level and turn on when this gets too low, and so are influenced by weather. They may also be set to switch off automatically when road usage is reduced, often at midnight, although currently most stay on until about the end of lighting-up time. Sunrise and sunset are defined by the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations as local sunrise and sunset so the times are different in different parts of the UK; they are earlier in the east and later in the west, and vary more with the seasons in northerly locations than in southerly locations. Lighting-up times were formerly commonly displayed in national and local newspapers in the UK and announced on national and local radio stations, but the widespread adoption of street lighting has rendered this largely redundant. As a result, most of the previous sources no longer provide them, but may still provide sunrise/sunset times.

He currently acts as chair for ‚Äútransnational relations, foreign- and security policy‚Äù at the Otto-Suhr Institute for Political Science at Freie Universit√§t Berlin. Furthermore, he has several engagements in German and international research networks, he also heads the PhD program of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Education Born in 1955, he received his PhD from the University of Frankfurt in 1987. From 1997 to 2001, he was joint chair of international relations at the European University Institute's Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies and the Department of Social and Political Sciences in Florence, Italy. Work Risse is usually identified as a constructivist scholar of international relations. In contrast to American constructivists, his work borrows heavily from German social theory and philosophy, and in particular the work of J√ºrgen Habermas. His work suggests that communicative action can reshape actors' understanding of their interests with important consequences for world politics. During the 1980s the main focus of his work laid on security policy, his dissertation ‚ÄúDie Krise der Sicherheitspolitik‚Äù (The Crisis of Security Policy) dealt with foreign and security policy decision making processes in West-Germany. In his thesis he observes the development of a Peace movement (opposed to the installation of medium-range rocket on German soil) and theorised their influence on West- German foreign policy. The contribution of his work is crucial to IR theory because it opposes the logic of equality between force and deterrence. With the end of the Cold War, the focus of his work shifted to transnational relations and human rights. One of his works out of this period is the edited volume ‚ÄúBringing Transnational Relations Back In‚Äù. Here he argues that regular interactions between non-state actors, that do not act on behalf of national governments, but try to influence the policies of a state, got out of focus. These organisations could be various NGOs for example, the Socialist International, Amnesty International or religious groups among others. In this volume an outlook on methodology and theory of transnational relations and their impact on domestic policy is developed. Another work of reference of this period is ‚ÄúDie Macht der Menschenrechte‚Äù (The Power of Human Rights). Based on liberal theory and democratic peace, Risse looks at international norms, speech acts and political change in the South. Whereby the main focus is laid on the realisation of human rights. His core theory is that the key for respect of human rights is the influence on transnational and domestic civil society on state structures. Inter alia he shows that economic development and democratisation do not forcibly go hand in hand. Post 9/11 his focus changed again towards research on failed states and governance. In his latest publication he focussed on aspects of governance in areas of limited statehood ‚Äì distinct from failed states.

History Past & Present of Kattoor The Kattoor grama panchayath established in the year 1952 AD. After starting freedom struggle a few patriots have marked their name in that movement. In other way we can say they have rendered sincere contribution by participating in the freedom struggle. History of kattoor Panchayath The area of Kattor panchayath was 25 square km at the very beginning of its formation. This Panchayath has been covered by Kattoor, Karalam village and a part of Manavalassery village. During the year 1977 AD, this panchayath has been divided and a new panchayath has been formed in the name of Karalam Grama panchayth. Border of Panchayth The border of the present Kattoor grama Panchayath are as follows. * North river Karuvannoor, * East Karalam Grama Panchayath, * South-Padiyoor grama Panchayath, * West Kanoli canal * Area of the panchayath is 11.70 km2. Population is about 17,000. Density of the population 1445 per km2. At the very beginning of Kattoor Grama Panchayath, office and related offices were functioning at Ponjanam, one km east of Kattoor School junction, in a rented building. Roman Catholic church authorities had donated the land to the authorities concerned to build its own building for panchayath. Before independence of India, Government of Kochi has constructed this panchayath building in the year 1937 in the land given by Roman Catholic church. If we are trying to penetrate to the yesterdays of Kattoor the history goes to old Kochi. The western border of Kattoor is Conolly Canal the other side of the canal is old Malabar. The cultural and religious life style of old Kochi and old Malabar have influenced the life style of the people of Katoor. The people of Kattoor and the surrounding places depends on agriculture and trade to meet their daily bread. A good number of people depends upon different kinds of works of related cultivation and trade of these places. How the name 'KATTOOR' originated? From the ancient period onwards their place was known as Kattoor. It is believed the reason for originating the name as Kattoor the surrounding places Vetha Kad,Chekkad, Pudukkad, Thazekkad, Mannookad, Karakkad, Illikad etc. were influenced to call their places as Kattoor in Malayalam.\\"Kad or Kat\\" is having a meaning of forest and nad\\" is meant for the apt place for living with civilized circumstances. Though this place is known as Kattoor means the 'oor' of a 'Kad'. In Malayalam 'Oor' means 'Nad' in an elaborated form 'nad 'of a 'Kad'. Though the name meant such. Prehistoric period During the period between 1500 AD and 1600 AD, after the arrival of Portuguese due to their special interest, this area has been made a trade center. Hence this Kattoor and near by places had developed a lot. Different kinds of trade have been developed on the banks of Kanoli Canal in Kattoor and Edathuruthy, (the eastern part of Malabar). Kattoor and Edathuruthy bazaar - known as 'Chantha' and 'Angady'- was famous for trading. In the pre-history period of Kattor there were lesser proximity of conveyance by road and transportable public roads are very rare in Kattoor like other places. Transportation was mainly made through water boat service. Kodungalloor, Kochi etc. were the main trade centers connecting with Kattoor by this water ways. The main cause of the development of these places were the trade introduced by the Portuguese. Kattoor Angady The Kattoor \\"Angady\\", well known for the early morning market, is situated in the banks of Kanoli Canal, which form most of the west boundary of Kattoor. Kattoor Angady has a \\"Chantha\\" (Commodity Exchange). It was famous due to its historical unique position. It is near to Kanoli Canal, it was close to old state borders and it has proximity to Arabian Sea. Kattoor side of Kanoli Canal was a part of Travancore Cochin and the other side, Edamuttam side, was a part of Malabar District which was an administrative district of British India. During the period of British empire, Kanoli Canal connected the north end to the south end of the State. Main propose of Kanoli Canal was transportation of goods. This canal is also connected to Arabian Sea. Old days, for a trading boat comes from Arabian Sea through Kanoli Canal, Kattoor was the nearest main market place. Due to these reasons Kattor \\"Chantha\\" was popular for exotic commodities coming from afar. Merchants and farmers from nearby villages used to come to Kattoor \\"Chantha\\" to buy and sell goods and produces.

St. Etheldreda's is built of local Hornton stone. The church existed by the late 12th century and its Norman central belltower and much of its chancel date from about 1180. Early in the 13th century the nave was replaced with one with north and south aisles and a higher roof. Early in the 14th century the chancel and both aisles were rebuilt and the south aisle and chancel were given new Decorated Gothic windows. Little of the 13th century nave and aisles now survives except the west wall and three Early English doorways. A clerestory was added to the nave and a porch was added to the repositioned south door. The tower buttresses may have been added at this time. Early in the 15th century the north wall of the north aisle was rebuilt, retaining the 13th century north doorway but gaining new Perpendicular Gothic windows. In about 1600 the west window was replaced with a three-light square-headed one. Early in the 17th century the chancel was in disrepair and the lay rector was repeatedly asked to fund repairs. In 1621 the chancel was reported to be so \\"ruinous and much decayed\\" that the rain came in. In 1632 the rest of the church was alleged to be \\"ready to fall\\". The tracery, in part of the east window, was rebuilt c1760The Ringers World Graham Nabb, Horley, St Ehteldred 4 April 2014 p329 and two of the north windows of the chancel was replaced. By 1879 St. Etheldreda's needed a thorough restoration and the vicar privately wrote that he feared for the safety of the tower. However, the tower was not put in good order until 1915, when church was restored under the direction of the Scottish architect William Weir. In 1947‚Äì50 the Oxford Diocesan Surveyor T. Lawrence Dale added a chancel screen and rood loft. Dale described this work as \\"One of the most enjoyable things he ever did\\", likening it to \\"putting new wine into an old bottle\\". St. Etheldreda's interior has Mediaeval wall paintings: a large and well-preserved one of Saint Christopher, on the north wall, and a rare one of Saint Zita, on the north nave pillar. The tower was repaired in 1785; a stair parapet was removed early in the 19th century. It had a ring of four bells, cast by William and Henry III Bagley of Chacombe in 1706. but two further bells, by John Taylor & Co, were added in 2013.The Ringers World Graham Nabb, Horley, St Ehteldred 4 April 2014 p330-331, 333 St. Etheldreda's is now one of eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Ironstone Benefice.

Neely is notable for agreeing to be interviewed by the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas at the University of California, at Davis. Neely declined to respond to a recall to active duty from the Individual Ready Reserve in 2007. mirror Neely reported that, after receiving letters from the Department of Defense, he was sent an honorable discharge from the Army Reserve. In January 2010, Neely flew to the United Kingdom and met with former captives. Neely and Ruhal Ahmed and Shafiq Rasul reconnected in 2009 via Rasul's Facebook page. The BBC Radio was scheduled to air a documentary about the meeting on January 14, 2010. Guantanamo duty Neely was a guard at Guantanamo for the first six months the camp was open, and described feeling guilty for the brutal treatment captives received at that time. In an interview with Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas Neely said that he and another guard experienced the first resistant prisoner for whom a \\"code red\\" (a euphemism for a violent extrajudicial punishment) was called, calling in the camp's first use of its immediate reaction force. He described how he and the other guard were trying to get a captive to kneel, so they could remove the captive's shackles. He could feel the captive trembling, and his body tense up. He and the other guard threw the elderly man to his cell's concrete floor, and called for the immediate reaction force. Neely described learning later that the reason the captive was shaking, and his body was so tense, was that he believed he was being made to kneel in preparation for his summary execution‚Äîa bullet to the back of the head. Neely described watching a medic calling upon the immediate reaction force to hold an underweight captive immobile so he could force him to drink a can of Ensure. When the captive wouldn't open his mouth, Neely said the medic asked Neely to move, and then punched the captive twice in the face. Neely said he only realized afterwards that the medic had him move to a point where Neely's body blocked the medics punches from the guards in the guard tower. He said later learned that the captive resisted drinking the diet supplement because he feared it was poisonous. Neely said that he saw camp medical staff perform a digital rectal examination, searching for contraband, without first lubricating their fingers, and that this made the captive scream in pain. Neely said that it had been a friend of his who was the first guard the captives saw drop a Qur'an on the ground. He said that this incident upset the captives so much it triggered a camp-wide hunger strike. While the Colonel in command of their unit said the guard who dropped the Qur'an would be punished, his friend was never punished. Neely said that female guards used to regularly take their turns escorting captives to the open-air showers, and that the captives felt humiliated to be exposed, naked, in front of the female guard. Neely said that camp authorities told the guards they could not leave Guantanamo for their next assignment unless they signed a confidentiality agreement, promising not to give interviews about Guantanamo, or to write about their experiences there themselves. Civilian life Brandon Neely is the former president of the Houston chapter of Iraq Veterans Against the War. Brandon Neely resigned from IVAW in early 2008 citing IVAW was becoming radical and anti-American. Neely became a police officer after his discharge in 2005. Neely is one of seven Twitter users suing U.S. President Donald Trump for being blocked from his @realDonaldTrump personal account. The Knight First Amendment Institute v.

Three brothers, Gordon, Douglas and Keith Blythe who owned and operated several pastoral leases in the east Kimberley devised an Air Beef Scheme (also known as the Glenroy Air Beef Scheme) by which a meatworks including an abattoir, carcase freezing facilities and an aerodrome were built at the remote Glenroy Station on the Mount House lease, about east of Imintji Aboriginal Community near Derby. The scheme operated successfully from 1949 to 1965 and was important for the economic development of the towns of Wyndham and Derby as well as the development of the Kimberley pastoral industry generally. Beef cattle were brought in from a radius around the east Kimberley to be slaughtered, quartered, boned and chilled overnight, and the following day air shipments were made to Wyndham, a , 75-minute flight away using Bristol Freighter and Douglas DC-3 aircraft. The beef was frozen at Wyndham and then shipped to the United Kingdom. Gordon Blythe had convinced MacRobertson Miller Airlines (MMA) to do a trial air shipment in May 1947 when four carcasses were slaughtered and left at the station at 2am, arriving in Perth in good condition at 3pm the same day. The trial being considered a success, a company Air Beef Ltd was established as a joint venture between the Blythes, MMA and Australian National Airways (ANA), with each party putting up one quarter of the capital and the Western Australian Government (through the North West Development and Advisory Committee, which was headed by Russell Dumas), assisting and providing a loan for the remaining quarter. It was hoped that the scheme would spawn a network of inland abattoirs throughout northern Australia, however this did not eventuate; plans for a similar facility at Fitzroy Crossing were shelved. The plant had a capacity of 300 head of cattle per week and in an average season (May to September) would process about 4,000 head per year. In 1949 the Commonwealth Government passed the \\"State Grants (Encouragement of Beef Production) Act 1949\\" which allowed funding for the construction of roads and other infrastructure to support the beef industry, as it was accepted by that time that airfreighting was going to be uneconomic in the long term. By 1953 the southern section of the Gibb River Road to Derby was completed and the first live shipment of cattle by truck from the east Kimberley was made. The Derby Meat Company (DEMCO, \\"Derby Meats\\") was established by the Blythes and others in 1959 and from then the airshipments were made to the closer destination of Derby. The construction of the road and the completion of slaughtering facilities at DEMCO in 1965 spelt the demise of the scheme and the abattoir was closed in the same year.

In addition trains travelling southwards (downhill) would be brought to a stand at the head of the incline for a brake test including, until 1941, passenger trains. In the days before through braking of goods trains, wagon brakes would have to be pinned down. Even later, when vacuum braking had been introduced, most trains would only be partly fitted and, often, a banking engine would have to lead the train to provide extra braking There were two platforms, that on the down (southward)Direction on this line was, and is, measured from milepost zero at Derby line being exceedingly long - much longer than that on the up side. Access to it was by a barrow crossing to the south, there being no footbridge. There were short goods sidings for each line running into bay platforms with an extra one on the up side. The entrance and booking hall was on the up platform, with a small waiting room on the other side. Construction was of typical Midland Railway brick built design with wooden awnings At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. The station closed in 1966. Although a few railway cottages still exist, the station itself has disappeared.

His work combines elements of still photography and the moving image.  Early life and education  Claerbout studied at Nationaal Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp from 1992-1995. He trained as a painter, but became more and more interested in time through investigations in the nature of photography, the still and the moving image (Bergson's duree echoed in Gilles Deleuze Cinema 1 and Cinema 2). Work David Claerbout is \\"best known for large-scale moving and still imagery that deals with the passage of time\\". In early works such as Kindergarten Antonio Sant‚ÄôElia 1932 made in 1998 and the last in a series, he presents an old, black and white photograph as a large, mute projection. In Vietnam, 1967, near Duc Pho (Reconstruction after Hiromishi Mine) (2001) time is suspended as an airplane caught by the camera moments before its crash, floats, the sunlight gently moving over a green and hilly landscape. In the book Visible Time, David Green writes: ‚ÄúWhat one actually experiences or indeed what one sees in this work, is not the conflation of photography and film but, a conjuncture of the two mediums in which neither ever loses its specificity. We are thus faced with a phenomenon in which two different mediums co-exist and seem to simultaneously occupy the same object. The projection screen here provides a point of intersection for both the photographic and filmic image.‚ÄùDavid Green & Joanna Lowry (eds) Visible Time: The work of David Claerbout, Brighton: Photoworks, 2004 With works such as Villa Corthout (2001) and Piano Player (2002), Claerbout‚Äôs work moves towards forms of narratives to describe ‚Äòmoments in time‚Äô within the moving image, taking a more cinematic dimension. In the Bordeaux Piece (2004) actors repeat a given dialogue and a set of given movements, deconstructing cinematic time. It centers on a conversation between a couple that is repeated over and over in different parts of a 1996 Bordeaux house designed by the architect Rem Koolhaas.Benjamin Genocchio (April 6, 2008), In the Spirit of Modernist Ideals The New York Times. The piece is in fact a 14 hours film made out of 70 shorter films shot at 10 minutes intervals throughout the day. The narrative slowly collapses, giving way to the movement of the sun over the landscape, architecture and people, thus creating a different temporality. One protagonist is played by Josse De Pauw, who helped Claerbout write the script.Adrian Searle (April 6, 2008), Adrian Searle encounters ... a teacup falling 70 times in a 14-hour film The Guardian. In Sections of a Happy Moment (2007), Claerbout seems to ‚Äòdissect‚Äô a moment in the life of a Chinese family in the courtyard of a nondescript estate. A group of people are gathered around a ball suspended mid-air, all the faces turned towards it, smiling happily. Over the course of 25 minutes, this moment in time is analyzed from a multitude of different angles and perspectives, allowing the viewer an omnipresence that is paradoxical. The fragmentation of time in this piece, through freeze ‚Äì frames of the same moment, creates 'visible duration'.Raymond Bellour in Van Assche, Christine (ed.) The Shape of Time, Z√ºrich: JRP Ringier/Centre Pompidou/MIT List Center of Visual Arts/De Pont Foundation/Kunstmuseum St. Gallen/Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, 2008 (exh.cat.) In Sunrise (2009), Claerbout presents an 18-minute work in near-darkness, accentuating the dim tones by projecting the film on to a grey surface. For nearly the entire film a housemaid goes about her chores in the muted light of pre-dawn, finally departing the house and cycling through a dimly-lit landscape, accompanied by Sergei Rachmaninoff's Vocalise (1912). Set on the coastline of Brittany, France, The Quiet Shore (2011) is a 36-minute black-and-white film capturing scenes that range from moments of minute detail to panoramic expanses of coastal landscape. The viewer experiences, frame by frame, a single moment from a multitude of different perspectives and viewpoints.Some Artists' Artists, June 26 - August 22, 2014 Marian Goodman, New York.  Exhibitions  Claerbout took part in the DAAD Berlin Artist Program in 2002‚Äì2003.

History  For details of the early history of the region, see History of Pomerania, of Order Prussia, and of Royal Prussia. Since 1466, when the rebels of the Prussian Confederation, partially successful in overthrowing the governing Teutonic Order, could only partition the western parts (Culmland, Pomerelia and Warmia) of Order Prussia, Borowina formed part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship in Polish-allied Royal Prussia. In 1772, in the course of the First Partition of Poland Borowina (Baarenh√ºtte) became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Borowina (Baarenh√ºtte) then formed a municipality in the newly founded . With partitioning the Preu√üisch Stargard District into smaller districts in 1818, Baarenh√ºtte became part of the new in the Danzig Region within West Prussia. In 1871 Barenh√ºtte, with all of Prussia, became part of Germany. In 1910 Barenh√ºtte counted 248 inhabitants.Cf. ‚ÄûK√∂nigreich Preu√üen - Provinz Westpreu√üen - Regierungsbezirk Danzig - Landkreis Berent‚Äú, on: Gemeindeverzeichnis Deutschland 1900, retrieved on 3 February 2018. Following the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, the Barenh√ºtte municipality, together with 14 other municipalities and manorial wards (Gutsbezirke) of the Berent District, was redistricted to the Danzig Heights District, and thus became part of the Free City of Danzig, a League of Nations mandate, in January 1920, more than a year after World War I.Cf. Rolf Jehke, ‚ÄûGemeindeverzeichnis Kreis Danziger H√∂he‚Äú, on: Territoriale Ver√§nderungen in Deutschland und deutsch verwalteten Gebieten 1874 - 1945, retrieved on 3 February 2018. In 1929 Barenh√ºtte counted 287 inhabitants.Cf. ‚ÄûWestpreu√üisches Ortsverzeichnis‚Äú , on: Familienforschung in Westpreu√üen, retrieved on 3 February 2018. After the German and Soviet Invasion of Poland, in 1939 Nazi Germany annexed the mandated Danzig territory in a unilaterally act, not recognised under international law, making also Barenh√ºtte a part of the new Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, an occupational authority not recognised under international law. Within Danzig-West Prussia Barenh√ºtte became part of the new for the period until the end of World War II. By the end of the war, in early 1945, the Red Army conquered and occupied the area. In summer 1945, following the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet occupation forces handed over Barenh√ºtte, like all of the mandated Danzig territory, to Polish forces. The Polish administration renamed Barenh√ºtte as Borowina. As far as mandate Danzig nationals of German ethnicity had not fled the Soviet invasion, most of them were expelled in the following years.

It was the winner of the Riga football league in 1910. In the period of independence of Latvia between the World wars Union played in the Latvian Higher League for several years. Being essentially a sports club of Baltic Germans, Union was disestablished in 1939 with the repatriation of Baltic Germans. History The Riga cycling club Union was founded in 1893. A football section of the club was opened in 1907 ‚Äì shortly after British FC Riga, thus Union was the second football club to be formed on the territory of Latvia. In the first years of its existence there was a tense rivalry between Union and BFC ‚Äì the former being a mostly German side and the latter ‚Äì a club for which played entirely Britons. In 1910 Union was one of the three sides to play in the newly founded Riga football league ‚Äì alongside BFC and ƒ∂eizarme≈æs (a second German side). BFC won the tournament however the British team was later disqualified and Union declared the winner.Miƒ∑elis Rubenis. Latvijas futbola vƒìsture Union won the first Riga Football Cup that was also played in 1910. Union won the second Riga league title in 1912, it was also twice second in the league ‚Äì in 1911 and 1915.Results of Union in prewar Latvia The most significant prewar-footballers in the Union team were Harold Trevenen Hall and Herberts Baumanis, the former was called \\"the father of Latvian football\\", while the latter was later one of the leading football officials in Latvia. Another footballer worth mentioning to play for Union in its early years was ƒåeslavs Stanƒçiks. Because of World War I and the struggle for independence football ceased to be played regularly in Latvia until 1919‚Äì1920. Union was among the sports clubs to be restored in the independent Latvia and it participated in the first restored Riga championship in 1921, however due to an early winter the season was not finished. In the next years competition Union finished fourth in the top tier of the Riga championship (out of 5 teams). Several top players left Union for ASK Riga after the season and the following year Union finished last in the league and was relegated to a lower level. Union played in the second Riga league division until 1927 when Virsliga was established ‚Äì a league to hold football clubs from both Riga and other cities of Latvia. Thus the top teams from Class A of Riga league were promoted to Virsliga and Union was among the teams to play in the new Class A. In 1929 Union finished second in Class A (with the same number of points as Riga Wanderer). It gave the club the right to play in play-offs for a spot in the expanded Virsliga. Union won its play-off matches and was to compete in Virsliga for the first time in 1930. In its first year in the top league Union finished fourth (it was in the second place in the league after the first half of the season) and improved by one position the next year ‚Äì winning its one and only Latvian league medals.Performance of Union in independent Latvia The following years the clubs fortune started to decline and in 1935 it faced relegation from Virsliga after an especially disappointing season.

It was a national chain that provided home electronics, domestic appliances, household furniture and related products on a hire purchase arrangement. Cash loans were offered towards the end of the company's life cycle. Caversham Finance Limited was owned by private equity firm Apollo Management. In October 2017, the company was ordered by the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, to pay 249,000 customers ¬£14.8m due to the firm not compensating customers who had cancelled agreements after one down payment and to those who signed up to \\"unaffordable\\" lending agreements. The FCA said the retailer has not been a \\"responsible lender\\" and had treated customers unfairly. On 30 March 2020, Grant Thornton were appointed as administrators.https://www.brighthouse.co.uk/customer-care/joint- administration BrightHouse collapsed as \\"the company had been struggling after an influx of compensation claims for selling to people who could not repay. Its shops were then shut owing to coronavirus restrictions on retailers.\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52090976 History BrightHouse, North End Road, Fulham, London Bramley, Leeds Brighthouse was founded by Thorn EMI in April 1994 as Crazy George, and intended to be a sister company to Radio Rentals. Crazy George was rebranded as BrightHouse in 2002. Caversham Finance Limited, having been initially a subsidiary of Thorn Group plc, was taken private in September 1998 in a deal arranged and financed by the Principal Finance Group of Nomura (now reconstructed as Terra Firma Capital Partners). The company was bought by Vision Capital in July 2007. It was later sold to Apollo Management in December 2017. Brighthouse employed more than 3,000 staff as of 2012. and had 311 stores as of January 2017. Brighthouse's revenue was ¬£351.7 million for the year ending 31 March 2015, and its pre-tax profits were ¬£19.6 million. In 2017 Brighthouse submitted a reform plan to its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, following criticism of its lending practices, and announced plans to close 28 stores. On 5 February 2019, Brighthouse announced that 30 stores were set to close due to poor trading conditions. In February 2020, in their quarterly report, the company is looking to move away from rent-to-buy and move to \\"a shift towards cash loans in due course.\\" Due to the Coronavirus epidemic the following month, the already struggling company was struck a final blow, this ambition would not be realised and the company collapsed. In July 2020, BrightHouse store seems to have closed in Burton. Back in March, shortly after UK lockout news, the holding firm of BrightHouse, Caversham Finance Limited, called in administrators.  Product offerings  BrightHouse previously stocked brands that included Samsung, Sony, Philips, Acer, LG, Nintendo, Baird, Whirlpool, Beko, BlackBerry and Nokia. The company charged interest of between 69.9% and 99.9% APR, and also charged for delivery, installation and compulsory warranties. An investigation by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in 2016 cited an example of a washing machine costing ¬£358, with a ¬£55 delivery and installation charge and compulsory ¬£136 warranty. The total cost of the appliance was ¬£1,092 at Brighthouse's typical interest rate of 69.9%. Some sources suggested Brighthouse made it impossible to compare prices, though ex- chief executive Leo McKee (current Hamish Paton)current employee said the retailer benefitted through a \\"really obsessive\\" approach to customer service, with \\"aspirational products at very competitive prices\\", claiming that though an active comparison is not obvious, it actively compared with other retail competitors; The Co-operative, Amazon.com, Yhor and 24Ace. Furniture accounted for about 20 per cent of sales, audio and visual for 30 per cent, domestic appliances for 20 per cent and technology for 30 per cent.  Awards  A branch in Bradford. In 2008, BrightHouse won Best High Street Recycler at the National Recycling Awards. Moreover, the company won a Green Apple Award for Environmental Best Practice.  Charity and partnerships  In October 2007, BrightHouse announced an exclusive agreement with Five to sponsor the Trisha Goddard show. BrightHouse partnered the NSPCC in 2009. As well as running various fundraising events for the charity, BrightHouse has posters and promotional material in their stores to raise awareness. Criticism Business practices In May 2009, an investigation by BBC Newsbeat suggested that BrightHouse mistreated customers who missed payments. A former employee told Newsbeat that the company tried to repossess goods without obtaining a court order, saying \\"We would just lie our way around it. Tell them we had the legal right to be there, and refuse to leave until they gave us the stuff.\\" Commercial director Hamish Paton denied the company mistreated its customers, saying \\"We would only ever take the goods with the consent of the customer\\". Chris Tapp, director of charity Credit Action called for the Office of Fair Trading to investigate. The company's lending practices have been criticised for targeting the \\"poorest, most desperate families\\" and operating in the \\"most deprived areas\\" of the UK. Other customers end up paying more than twice what they would have paid without BrightHouse's finance charges.Don Mort, \\"Don't fall prey to doorstep lenders plea\\", Wakefield Express, Jan 1, 2010, accessed 18 March 2010. Their base prices have also been noted to be higher than those of upscale mainstream retailers such as Harrods. In 2015 BrightHouse, along with its two largest competitors PerfectHome and Buy as You View, were criticised by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Debt and Personal Finance. According to Parliamentary group chair Yvonne Fovargue, \\"Rent-to-own stores like BrightHouse charge inflated prices to some of the poorest people in the country. Customers are often obliged to take out additional warranties and insurance, as a result paying several times the true value of the goods.\\" BrightHouse chief executive Leo Mckee defended the company, saying that \\"We are proud to serve our customer base of lower income families. The service we provide gives them access to high-quality products for their homes at competitive prices.\\" In 2016 former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband joined a campaign against Brighthouse in his Doncaster constituency. Miliband accused the company of trying to \\"fleece\\" customers with expensive insurance and of harassing people who fall behind on their payments, and urged the public to use a local credit union instead. An investigation for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in 2016 found that the company was selling to vulnerable people. The programme cited an example of a man with learning difficulties and mental illness who was paying Brighthouse for five separate items out of his benefit payments. It also featured an autistic man who purchased a PlayStation 4 from Brighthouse despite not understanding the contract, according to his mother who intervened on his behalf to get the contract cancelled. Tax avoidance In January 2015 Private Eye reported that BrightHouse had paid very little UK corporation tax between 2007 and 2014 ‚Äì less than ¬£6m ‚Äì after revenues of ¬£1.6bn and operating profits of ¬£191m. According to Private Eye, interest of ¬£76m owed to a Luxembourg-registered subsidiary of BrightHouse's then owners Vision Capital had significantly reduced taxable profits. In addition, records showed BrightHouse's '5 star' insurance to be operated through a sister company based in Malta, where tax on profits would in effect be no more than 5 per cent under Maltese law. BrightHouse told Private Eye it complies with all relevant tax regulations and that all its arrangements were agreed with HMRC.\\"Low Income High Profits\\", Private Eye No.1384 23 January - 5 February 2015 In 2017, The Guardian disclosed details from the Paradise Papers that Queen Elizabeth II had invested some money in the company over a 12-year period via the Duchy of Lancaster.

At an elevation of 29.4 m, its surface area is ca. 0.592 km¬≤. The lake forms the border between the German states of Berlin and Brandenburg. It is bordered in the north by the Wannsee district of Berlin, and in the south and west by the Babelsberg district of Potsdam in Brandenburg. Overview At its eastern end, near Kohlhasenbr√ºck in Berlin, the Griebnitzsee receives water from the Teltow Canal. One third of this water flows into the adjacent Griebnitz Canal and through a chain of lakes towards the Gro√üer Wannsee. The remaining water flows through the Griebnitzsee to its western end, where it flows into the River Havel near Potsdam. The length of the Griebnitzsee is navigable, and forms part of the Teltow Canal route that links the River Havel with the River Spree and the Oder-Spree Canal, bypassing the reach of the River Spree through central Berlin. The navigable Griebnitz Canal provides an alternative link from the Griebnitzsee to the River Havel via the Gro√üer Wannsee. During the time of the Berlin Wall, the border between Berlin and East Germany ran down the middle of the lake. A patrol path existed for border guards along the southern and western shore. After German reunification, this path became a public lake-side promenade.

It is located within the High Black Forest and lies in a hollow formed by ice age glaciation between the villages of Altglash√ºtten, Falkau and Aha on the territory of the municipality of Lenzkirch. The lake lies in a trough that runs from the Seebach valley in the northwest to the Schluchsee in the southeast and thus crosses the generally northeastward-running streams in the area. This remnant of a former valleyIn the geomorphological literature it is referred to as the Ur-Schwarza or Ur- Mettma valley. (Ekkehard Liehl: Landschaftsgeschichte des Feldberggebietes.

North of the low-lying watershed in this trough, between the Haslach in the north and the Ahabach in the south, now drowned by the impounded Schluchsee, the glacier of the last ice age carved out a basin, in which a small bog lake formed, the natural precursor to today's reservoir. This was enlarged in 1895 by the former Falkau Screw Works (Schraubenfabrik Falkau) with a dam in the north and the water surface raised by about 6 metres. At the same time the lake, which had only hitherto been fed from the east by the K√§hnerb√§chle, was given another inflow in the form of a small leat (Hangkanal) from the southwest. Since 1932 the Windgf√§llweiher has been incorporated into the transfer of water from the Seebach to the Schluchsee (covered leat) and drained since then in the opposite direction i.e. to the south. The water is led via a ditch over the low watershed, initially as the Windgef√§llbach and later, the Schwarzach, into the Schluchsee. Since 1950 the lake has been protected.Windgf√§llweiher bei hochschwarzwald.de In 2002 an angling and fish consumption ban was announced, because PCB had been discovered in the sediment depositions on the bottom of the lake.Ralf Morys: Beh√∂rden bewerten PCB-Altlast im Windgf√§llweiher neu, Badische Zeitung, 25 May 2013, retrieved 23 November 2014 On the wooded eastern shore of the Windgf√§llweiher, a lake barely touched by the streams of visitors to the area, lies a rather less picturesque bathing beach with a listed building.

Quattrociocchi (June 11, 1929 ‚Äì February 24, 1996) was a 20th-century politician most notable for having served as New York State Senator. He was a Democrat for most of his political career. Life Quattrociocchi was born on June 11, 1929, in Rochester, New York. He attended Edison Technical and Industrial High School. After graduation, he served the United States Air Force where he became Airman First Class in a radar unit. He then began a 30-year career as a communications technician at AT&T;, where he joined the Communications Workers of America. His first foray into politics was an unsuccessful run for the Monroe County, New York legislature in 1973. He prevailed in the election two years later for the same seat, representing part of Greece, New York, and held that office for a total of five consecutive terms. In 1984, he unseated incumbent William M. Steinfeldt for the 55th district Senate seat. Quattrociocchi was a member of the New York State Senate from 1985 to 1992, sitting in the 186th, 187th, 188th and 189th New York State Legislatures. Senator Ralph Quattrociocchi Memorial Highway Quattrociocchi's accomplishments include securing state funding to extend New York State Route 531 to Ogden, New York, forming a senate task force on teen stress, and instituting \\"Operation Watch\\" to reduce the likelihood of mishaps at railroad crossing signals. In 1988, Quattrociocchi was swept up in Robert M. Morgenthau's investigation of Senate Minority Leader Manfred Ohrenstein and the alleged misuse of state monies to fund the 1986 campaigns of several state Senators. The presiding judge found that Quattrociocchi was aware that a full- time aide had been hired for the sole purpose of campaigning, but since the deed had taken place outside of New York County, the District Attorney had no jurisdiction. District Attorneys in Albany and Monroe counties subsequently declined to prosecute. In the early 1990s, the 55th senate district was redrawn to include Brighton, Monroe County, New York and parts of the city of Rochester, ultimately leading to his defeat in both the 1992 Democratic primary and the general election. Quattrociocchi switched political parties the year before the 1994 election, only to be defeated again. He died of a heart attack in 1996 and is interred in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.

It was built in 1869-1870 and is typical of the Italian Villa mode of late 19th-century architecture. It was dedicated in a large ceremony with speeches later published in a printed phamplet and attending crowds in early 1870. Old Eastern High is a two-story brick structure that features a square plan, three corner towers (northwest, southwest, southeast), and elaborate bracketing cornices, with a similar wood decorated porch/portico over front entrance on its west side facing Aisquith Street. Eastern Female High School was founded (along with its twin sister secondary school Western High School) in 1844 and was one of the pioneer high schools in the country devoted to secondary education for women. It was designed by Baltimore architect Colonel R. Snowden Andrews (1830-1903), also a former officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. In 1907, the girls high school moved to larger, better equipped quarters further northeast in the city at the southeast corner of Broadway and East North Avenue (the former Samuel Gompers Vocational High School building, 1938-1953), where it remained for another three decades until 1938, when it moved to East 33rd Street and Loch Raven Boulevard (Eastern High School (Baltimore), until it closed in the late 1980s. Then the old girls school building on Aisquith and Orleans was used as an elementary school through the early 1970s. Later in the 1970s the building was converted into apartments. The city transferred the building to Sojourner-Douglass College in 2004. The college, which also operated in several other former buildings of the Baltimore City Public Schools, ceased operation in 2015, and the building remains vacant as of 2019. Eastern Female High School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

The game featured unrestricted PvP, full looting, a large, dynamic game world, and a player-skill dependent combat system free of the class and level systems that typify most MMORPGs. Darkfall had a 3D world environment and contained mild violence. The official Darkfall servers were closed on November 15, 2012. Aventurine has since sold the license of Darkfall Online to two independent companies, Ub3rgames and Big Picture Games. Development history (2001 to 2012) On 29 August 2001, Razorwax announced the development of Darkfall and launched its official website. The Razorwax development team was based in Oslo, Norway, and initially consisted of five members: Claus Grovdal (Lead Design and Producer), Ricki Sickenger (Lead Tools and Game Logic Programmer), Henning Ludvigsen (Art Director), Kjetil Helland (Lead 3D/Client Programmer), and Erik Sperling Johansen (Lead Server Programmer). Approximately 14 months later, in October 2002, the Razorwax team was integrated into Aventurine SA, a newly formed company based in Athens, Greece, ostensibly created for the continued development and subsequent commercialisation of Darkfall. When the Razorwax team and the Aventurine team had their first meeting in Athens, a member of one of the teams joked that Razorwax should relocate from Norway to Greece due to the lower taxes and cost of living in Greece. Eventually, the two teams realised that this idea actually made very good business sense,http://www.mmorpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID;=715 and by December 2002, the relocation of Razorwax, now Aventurine, was finalised. In September 2005, a signup page for a closed clan beta was made available on the web; this beta never happened, however a 1.5 minute Darkfall gameplay video was released in February 2006 as recompense to the community. A later statement from associate producer Tasos Flambouras explained that a decision had been made internally to devote additional money and resources into expanding the scope of the game. Darkfall's first major public revelation was at the game convention E3 in 2006, and while Aventurine did not have a publicly playable version at the time, various industry journalists were shown a standalone demonstration version of the game. From June 2006 onwards, just after E3, the Darkfall development team began releasing bi-weekly developer journals and community question/answer articles, published on the game forum site Warcry. An announcement on 11 July 2006 stated that preparations were being made to begin beta, although Aventurine stated it did not have a publisher for Darkfall at the time, and that they were considering the possibility of self-publishing the game. Six months later, on 17 January 2007, Aventurine announced they were in active discussions with prospective partners, distributors, publishers, and technology providers, and that a fully functional and stable beta build was running on remote servers. On 30 January 2007, Aventurine released their second official gameplay video, consisting of about one minute of in-game footage demonstrating real-time melee combat, mounts (including mounted combat), spell-casting and naval combat. In May 2007, Aventurine gave an update on their progress towards beta, announcing that their internal target date for beta was in Summer 2007. A later update, on 2 August 2007, stated that beta would not start until negotiations with possible publishers were complete. On 22 February 2008, Aventurine released a \\"location test video\\" depicting various NPC and player-crafted city locations in the game. Later, in April 2008, it was announced that Darkfall was feature- complete, and in May, that \\"... our launch date will be inside 2008, with the public beta preceding it by a few weeks. This is official and internally we're a lot more specific, but pending an announcement, we cannot say more at this time\\". In June 2008, Aventurine confirmed they had signed with Greek company AudioVisual Enterprises to distribute Darkfall in Europe, and this was confirmed by AudioVisual in a stock market announcement made to the Greek Stock Exchange. On 29 August 2008, Darkfall's official beta was announced as the final scene of a 17-minute gameplay video, which demonstrated numerous aspects of the game, such as small and large group PVP, including small and large group mounted combat, ship sailing and naval combat, magic and archery, and vehicular combat, creative use of in-game physics and magic, crafting, banking, 3 different PVE encounters demonstrating mob AI, and city building and sieging. This was soon followed by a \\"limited public hardware test\\" of Darkfall as the first phase of public beta, which was then followed by a staged gameplay-oriented public beta. On 16 October 2008, Darkfall was publicly presented at Athens Digital Week. This event was unofficially reported by a member of the Darkfall forum moderators during this event, including a 30-minute video of Darkfall played live on stage. On 5 December 2008, Tasos Flambouras announced that Darkfall would be released for the European market on 22 January 2009, with an American release to follow. This launch date was later revised to 25 February 2009. The NDA for beta players was lifted on 18 February 2009. On 24 June 2009, Tasos announced that Darkfall will launch in North America on 7 July 2009, alongside Darkfall's first free expansion to the game. Darkfall launched successfully in North America on 13 July 2009. Darkfall's first free expansion launched in July 2009 featuring massive monster re-balancing, player housing, Darkfall's village system, the Nexus system, a character specialization system, the weather system, special items, new weapons and much more. Darkfall's second free expansion launched in early December 2009. The EU-1 server went down late on Thursday December 3 and the North American Server went down shortly after for patching. The update was the largest the game has seen to date and added many desired dynamics to the game not seen in the game's first 9 months. Shortly before both servers went live extensive patch notes were released for the 2nd expansion titled \\"Conquer the Seas\\". On 11 June 2010, Darkfall developers released patch outlines which outlined critical fixes to the game. These fixes are some of the most important changes made to Darkfall to date. On 10 February 2011, Darkfall developers released yet another patch which addressed several issues that had major effects on gameplay. Three Notable changes were clan bank permissions, War Status Timeouts (7 days from declaration), and bindstone mechanics designating where you will spawn in the event changes in political affiliation and alignment. On 25 April 2011, Aventurine changed hosting locations to Chicago to improve server stability. On 2 July 2012, Aventurine released the Ultimate Promotion patch. It increased skill gains and loot while removing the purchase fee entirely and reducing monthly subscription cost to $9.95, down from $15. This promotion ran from release until the launch of Darkfall 2.0. On 18 September 2012, Aventurine announced Darkfall Unholy Wars. The game was due to launch in November 20. On 14 November 2012, Aventurine announced that due to a combination of external factors, last minute issues, and final testing feedback, the company was forced to push back the release date to 12 December 2012. Darkfall Unholy Wars is set again in the fantasy world of Agon, countless centuries after the events that took place in the original Darkfall Online. The company released a set of feature, game play and developer diary videos to support the launch on their official YouTube channel. Development history (2012 to present) On 28 April 2015, Axilmar, a gui developer working on the actual Unholy Wars, posted a petition on Reddit to taste the interest in a classic Darkfall server due to the demand of the community. The petition raised about 1789 signatures. About a month later he presented the result to the Aventurine CEO. On 15 June 2015, after 3 days of delay the CEO of Aventurine Zad Mehdawi posted a message where he explained that Darkfall is not feasible due to the large investment in the infrastructure and development support needed to run the game, and so they ditched a Darkfall revival but were continuing to work and improve the actual game Unholy Wars. However the company is open to serious proposals for licensing and support the original Darkfall game. On 16 June 2015, Claus Grovdal, the original creator of Darkfall, former Razorwax CEO, wrote on Twitter that he was disappointed that Aventurine is not considering bringing back Darkfall Online. On 18 November 2015, the community manager Ici Wave in a post on the official forum, wrote that Aventurine was under negotiations with 2 interested parties for the license of Darkfall Online. On 3 February 2016, Ub3rgames confirmed the acquisition of Darkfall Online license and updated their own website. On 1 March 2016, Big Picture Games also confirmed the acquisition of the Darkfall Online license. On 8 March 2016, Ub3rgames along with their weekly update, released the first in-game footage of Darkfall: New Dawn. On 19 March 2016, Big Picture Games released the first in-game footage of Darkfall: Rise of Agon. On 8 April 2016, Big Picture Games released the closed alpha for Darkfall: Rise of Agon with NDA in place and first 500 invites along with a new alpha trailer. They also opened the store with 3 different founder packs. On 14 June 2016, Ub3rgames in their weekly update announced the launch date of Darkfall: New Dawn stress test for the 28 June 2016 at 2:00 PM Paris time. On 3 August 2016, Big Picture Games announce the launch of the closed beta. On 16 August 2016, Darkfall: New Dawn switch from free stress test to InDev beta, only people who bought the game can play it. On 05 May 2017, Darkfall: Rise of Agon launched. On 26 January 2018, Darkfall: New Dawn launches. Gameplay Skills Darkfall departs from the conventional MMORPG paradigm of character levels as the main form of character progression, favouring instead a broad skill-based system, similar to that found in games such as Ultima Online, Eve Online, Wurm Online and Asheron's Call. Skills and skill proficiency determine a wide range of a character's capability in the game, including weapons and weapon skills, a few special attacks, spells, and archery, all aspects of player crafting, as well as more basic facets of gameplay, such as the ability to swim, craft various types of items, and to ride and control mounts. Skills may be learned from NPC trainers in the game, however certain skills will require other skills as prerequisites. Without exception however, skills are improved (raised in power) through actual usage in game. Playable races There are six playable races in Darkfall, divided into 3 factions. Unlike other MMORPGs, racial choice does not heavily influence character choices or progression options. Each race begins play in their own homeland, and have their own unique storylines, histories, and racial alliances/enemies. It is possible to form mixed-race clans of opposing factions, however racial alignment adjustments (see 'Alignment') are always in effect. While certain races have friendships and hatreds with other races in Darkfall, these are not strictly enforced upon the players, and it is possible for allied clans to declare war upon both their own race and their racial allies. Declaring war against a clan will prevent players of the declaring clan from sustaining alignment penalties (as well as gains) associated with attacking and killing players of the opposing clan, regardless of race. The races, organised by faction, are: * Alfar (dark elves) * Orks, Mahirim (wolf men) * Humans, Mirdain (forest elves), Dwarves Attributes * Strength: Increases damage dealt with melee weapons, and moderately affects max health. * Vitality: Grants a bonus to max health and moderate bonus to stamina. A high vitality may slightly reduce the effects of poison and bleeding. * Dexterity: Increases archery damage and may reduce damage taken from area effects. * Quickness: Slightly increases melee and archer speed and may reduce damage taken from such attacks. Also grants a moderate bonus to max stamina. * Intelligence: Increases the power of spells and greatly affects max mana. It also improves resistance against mental attacks. * Wisdom: Grants a bonus to all crafting and harvesting skills. Also moderately affects max mana, and grants a slight resist bonus against curses. As with other MMORPGs, player characters have a set of semi-static attributes, which determine their in-game physical and mental prowess. These attributes are: strength, vitality, dexterity, wisdom, intelligence, and quickness These attributes improve over time in response to player activity. For example, repeated use of a melee weapon will result in a gradual improvement in that player's strength statistic, which in turn will allow him to deal greater melee damage. There are also three dynamic attributes: hit points, mana, and stamina, which determine a player's overall vitality and capacity for physical activity and/or magic, which fluctuate in response to performing actions and receiving damage. Likewise, the casting of magical spells requires and expends mana points, and the execution of various physical activities, such as sprinting, the swinging of weapons, and casting of spells expend stamina. All three of these statistics are regained over time at varying rates, and may be rapidly regained through the use of healing and other restorative spells, potions and items. PvP Darkfall has been designed from the outset as a full-loot PVP game, meaning on death players are able to fully loot other players of their gear and gold on their person. The ability to fully loot other players has been factored into the game as an important facet of the risk versus reward nature of the game. The ability to fully loot other players is a significant departure from other, contemporary MMORPGs, such as World of Warcraft and EverQuest II, in which the quest for better gear is the primary driving force of player character improvement once maximum level has been attained. In Darkfall, character skills are the primary driver of character improvement, and gear also plays a large role in determining a player character's overall power. Friendly fire and collision detection are always in effect in Darkfall. Combined with a real-time combat system, Darkfall's combat is anticipated to provide a more realistic combat experience than other fantasy MMORPGs. The developers have opined that historically successful battle formations and tactics will be widely adopted and adapted for use in Darkfall. City building and conquest 300px The goal of Darkfall is its support for large- scale territorial conflict between player clans. To this end, empire building through the conquering of pre-made cities is a major part of the game. To promote such conflict, there is a finite number of pre-made cities (97 locations - 44 cities, 53 Hamlets) within the world. The potential pre-made city and hamlet sites are marked in-game by structures known as clanstones. These pre-made city sites are spread across the entirety of the world, and vary greatly in location, surrounding terrain, access to nearby resource nodes, and consequently, their ability to be defended by the owning clan. Player clans have full diplomatic control over their relationship with other player clans, and can declare war on other clans unilaterally. Clans that are at war with each other may kill each other freely without alignment penalties. Player-owned cities can be freely attacked and then sieged. Sieges last for 4 hours. In the first two hours the defenders may launch an attack on the enemy's shard holder or city. If the defenders are victorious, the siege ends. The attackers may attempt to capture the defender's city after two hours have passed. They only have two hours to destroy the clanstone. To this end, Darkfall contains a variety of different siege weapons such as cannons and siege hammers, all of which are player-crafted. There is a limit on the rate of destruction of a captured city of 1 building per day, however any number of buildings may be disabled at any time by bringing their structural integrity to zero. Player housing was later added. Houses were stationed across the world and the owners could build various things inside their home or as an add-on to it once they locate a rare item called a \\"house deed\\" and find an empty spot for their home. Players would then pay taxes on their home or else they could lose it to another player who is willing to pay the tax. Clans are able to fight over these villages for control of the tax revenue which adds additional PvP elements. In the patch \\"Conquer the Seas\\", Darkfall received two large fortresses at the North and South ends of Agon. These fortresses are only attack-able from a player built ship. If a clan controls the sea tower they get a server wide broadcast of their accomplishment, free recruitment postings in NPC towns, and additional revenue. Tons of fixes to the conquest system were also introduced in 2009 and bugged city structures were fixed. Alignment Darkfall features a player character alignment system that ranges from good to evil based upon the actions of players. Characters start the game with a good alignment, which decreases on performing \\"evil\\" actions such as attacking racial allies without provocation, or killing racial allies. The consequences of evil actions include being temporarily attackable by guard towers in NPC controlled cities, and other players being able to attack these \\"grey\\" players without repercussion. A succession of evil actions results in negative alignment, and a permanent \\"kill on sight\\" (\\"red\\") status. Alignment can be regained only by killing racial enemies and/or by killing other evil players. In the 31 March 2011 patch, alignment can only be regained by praying at a church in a chaos city. Stealth In Darkfall, stealth is accomplished by playing stealthily, employing real-world stealth techniques such as moving in darkness/shadow, employing camouflage, walking silently, and using world objects as cover; that is, stealth is not automatic, and not restricted to any particular class or subset of players. Since Darkfall is a classless MMORPG, any player is able to practise stealth-enhancing skills such as \\"crouch-walking\\" and to follow a stealthy play style. This feature of stealth also comes with semi-realistic limitations - metallic armour reflects light. Stealth in Darkfall is also made possible through the deliberate lack of showing players on the minimap and use of first-person perspective for ranged combat and general movement. The Darkfall world Geography Darkfall claims to feature one of the largest online worlds of any MMORPG created to date. The Darkfall world consists of a large, central continent named Agon, on which all six racial capitals are found, surrounded by four smaller continents to the north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west. In addition, there are numerous small islands and archipelagos. It was estimated by one of the developers before release that it would take roughly eight hours for a human to run from one end to the other. In reality, the time to cross the main continent is closer to 4 hours, stretching the time to cross the map on a diagonal up to around six. (For comparison, Blizzard's World of Warcraft continent of Eastern Kingdoms is three hours from north to south.) The world includes a wide range of diverse terrain types, including forest, plain, desert, ice, jungle/tropical, swamp, and wasteland areas. Every part of the Darkfall world has been handmade by the developers and not computer generated. Darkfall developers have stated that any/all terrain can be accessed and traversed by characters possessing the appropriate skills, e.g. mountains may be climbed by those who possess the ability to climb; islands may be reached by swimming. Monster spawns and AI Darkfall has a relatively small number of mob spawns relative to land mass compared to contemporary MMORPGs, in an attempt to reflect a more \\"realistic\\" style. Mobs also display generally higher artificial intelligence than in other games, and will frequently call for help, strategically retreat, dodge, and switch between melee and ranged attacks. Consequently, mobs are generally more difficult than in other MMOGs, to the extent that widescale mob rebalancing was a specific focus for the recent Darkfall expansion. The December patch of Darkfall further improved the AI of the mobs, making them even more difficult to take down. Wild creatures In order for the world to feel more alive and add new elements to the gameplay, the most recent patch of Darkfall included non-aggressive wild animals (such as deer) that players can hunt. They provide a number of resources. Dungeons Darkfall features several dungeons and underground areas. Both the Alfar and Dwarven racial capital cities are located predominantly underground. The dungeons in the world of Agon are not traditionally \\"instanced\\" like in other games. An instance is a separate game universe that a group of people are taken to when entering a dungeon so they can fight through the dungeon alone. In Darkfall the dungeons are available for everyone, and are not instanced‚Äîso-called open world dungeons as were the norm in first-generation MMORPGs such as EverQuest. The most notable effect of this is that players are fighting with other groups of people that are in the same dungeon in the non-instanced world. This is a result of the fact that the entire game world is seamless; everyone on a given server is sharing the same game session, from towns to dungeons. Launch The game went live at 9 p.m. Central European Time (UTC+1) on 26 February 2009, twelve hours after the announced launch time. The launch saw a number of setbacks due to unexpected high demand; players stumbled upon a critical bug which the developers took the game down to fix, and Aventurine's website was unable to handle the overwhelming amount of traffic to the online store and forums, causing those features to become generally unavailable to customers for several hours. It was also reported by Aventurine that there were problems with the pre-order system. As a result of these problems, customers were awarded with four days of free game time. The game launched on multiple online outlets such as Impulse on 1 July 2010. Reception Game Observer gave Darkfall an overall score of 83/100. Meristation gave Darkfall an overall score of 7/10. Eurogamer game reviewer Ed Zitron awarded the game a rating of 2 out of 10. However, this review was not received well as it contained several basic gameplay description errors, and Darkfall lead developer Tasos Flambouras claims that game server logs show that the Eurogamer reviewer played the game for under three hours, a claim denied by the writer. Eurogamer subsequent offer to compromise by commissioning a second opinion review (by noted games critic Kieron Gillen) was declined by Flambouras, but was carried out anyway, being awarded 4/10.

As a standard, OpenTherm is independent of any single manufacturer. A controller from manufacturer A can in principle be used to control a boiler from manufacturer B. However, OpenTherm controllers and boilers do not in fact always work properly together. The OpenTherm standard comprises a number of optional features and some devices may include manufacturer-specific features. The presence or absence of such features may impair compatibility with other OpenTherm devices.  History  OpenTherm was founded in 1996 because multiple manufacturers needed a simple-to-use communicating system between room controller and boiler. It had to run, like the existing controllers, over the existing two wires, not polarity sensitive, without the use of batteries. For one British pound, Honeywell sold the first specification to the OpenTherm Association on November 1996. Shortly after, the first products appeared on the market. By 2008 the Association had grown to around 42 members and has regularly updated and improved the specification. Furthermore, the Association is also active in lobbying for the interests of its members and is also present at exhibitions like the ISH (Frankfurt) and the Mostra Convegno (Milan). , the association has 53 members from around the world.  Design  Communication is digital and bi-directional between the controller (master) and the boiler (slave). Various commands and kinds of information can be transferred; however, the most basic command is to set the boiler's target water temperature. OpenTherm makes use of a traditional untwisted 2-wire cable between controller and boiler. OpenTherm is not polarity sensitive: wires can be swapped. The maximum wiring length is 50 m up to maximum 2 x 5 ohm resistance. For backward compatibility with traditional switching thermostatic controllers, OpenTherm specified that if the two wires are connected together then the boiler will switch on.  Multi Point to Point  Specification 3.0 also describes how more than two devices can be connected by OpenTherm. Whilst OpenTherm is a point-to-point connection, an extra device (gateway) is added between the master and the slave. This gateway has 1 slave and 1 (or more) master interfaces. The gateway controls which data is passed to each slave. An application example is a room temperature controller connected to a heat recovery unit, which is connected to a boiler. The heat recovery unit is then functioning as gateway. In another possible configuration, a thermostat or room controller is connected to a sequencer with further Opentherm interfaces connected to more than one boiler. The room controller can be a standard unit, since it only 'sees' one heat-producer. The sequencer includes additional software to increase or decrease the number of running boilers to match the actual heat demand. The sequencer also needs a sensor to measure the temperature of the combined output from the boilers and usually would also control a main circulation pump. What happens after a fault occurs (resequencing remaining units, passing fault messages through for display on the room controller, etc.) is also part of the sequencer functionality. (The hydraulic design of such a system must also take account of different combinations of boilers running at the same time: a Low Loss Header / Hydraulic Separator is usually included to combine the flows from the boilers.)  Variants   OpenTherm/Plus (OT/+)  The two wires are used both to supply power to the controller and for bidirectional digital communication between the controller and the boiler. The minimum available power is 35 mW. When using OpenTherm Smart Power this can, by master request, also be 136 mW (medium power) or 255 mW (high power). The controller transmits to the boiler by sending a Manchester-encoded sequence in the Voltage domain. The boiler transmits data back to the controller in the current domain. OpenTherm specifies a maximum communications interval of one second. The data in the communication packet is functionally specified and is called OpenTherm- ID (OT-ID). 256 OT-IDs are available, 128 are reserved for OEM use. The other 128 are reserved, 90 of them are functionally specified. (OT specification v3.0)  OpenTherm/Light (OT/-)  When OT/- is used the master generates a PWM voltage signal, representing the boiler water temperature set point. The boiler current signal indicates the status of the boiler: error, no error. Due to the limited possibilities OT/- is rarely used .  OpenTherm Smart Power  On June 16, 2008 OpenTherm specification 3.0 was approved by the association. This version introduces OpenTherm Smart Power. The master can request the slave to change the available power to low, medium or high power. With this master manufacturers can add more functionality to their products (backlight or extra sensors).  Certification  Manufacturers are allowed to market OpenTherm products when they comply with some rules of the OpenTherm association. Most importantly the manufacturer has to be an OpenTherm member, and the product must be tested by an independent testing body. By handing over the test report and a Declaration of Conformity to the association, the manufacturer is allowed to use the OpenTherm logo.

It was a center of industry, religion and politics, with the seat of its kingdom in the town of Deg√©. The kings of Derge followed a 1300-year lineage. \\"CASTLE OF THE RAJAH OF DE-GE AT DE-GE GONCHEN\\" (original caption) from alt= At its height, the population of the kingdom consisted of 12‚Äì15,000 families. The northern border of the kingdom was defined by Qinghai Lake; on the east, the boundary terminated at those states that utilized the Horpa variation of the Rgyalrongic languages, Chantui and Litang; the southern and western boundaries were defined by Batang, Sanai, Gonjo and Draya; and Lhato and Chamdo, respectively. The kingdom was known for its metal working and was an important center in the establishment of the Rim√© movement in Tibetan Buddhism. The royal family of Derge were known as supporters of art, producing such artists as Situ Panchen, the kingdom's senior court chaplain, who is also known for his contributions to medicine and religion. Regent Queen Tsewang Lhamo (d. 1812) was known for her support of printing and publishing. History Deg√© became the capital of the kingdom in the 15th century under the reign of Lodro Tobden, the 31st in the line of the Derge kings. It was he who invited Thang Tong Gyalpo to establish the renowned Gongchen Monastery in the region. The kingdom expanded during the 18th century under the reign of Tenpa Tsering, who conquered territories to the north. In 1727, the Kingdom of Derge and other regions in Eastern Tibet fell under the governance of China. It is linked with others of the \\"more important districts\\", as Spencer Chapman termed them, such as Nyarong, Batang, Litang, and the five Hor[pa] States under the name \\"Kham\\", which Chapman describes as \\"an indefinite term suitable to the Tibetan Government, who are disconcertingly vague over such details as treaties and boundaries.\\"Chapman, F. Spencer. (1940). Lhasa: The Holy City, p. 135. Readers Union Ltd., London. In 1733. The Yongzheng Emperor granted the king of Derge status of Hsuan Wei Ssu, a high position for native chieftains which effectively permitted him independence, though he was responsible for paying tribute.Coales, 224. In spite of the change of provenance, the kings of the region continued their internal struggles, and in 1863, rule of the kingdom was disrupted for two years by the successful invasion of Nyarong. Intervention by the army of Tibet restored the kingdom, following a brief intermediate governance. In the early 1900s, Eric R. Coales prepared a report that included information about the \\"recent\\" history of the kingdom for the British.Coales, 202. According to Coales' report, in 1895, the Governor- General of Szechuan sent forces into Chantui, led by General Chang Chi, who advanced further into Derge.Coales, 222-223. The king and his family were imprisoned in Chengdu. By the time political intrigue in China had forced the troops to withdraw, the king had died, leaving behind two sons, Doje Senkel and Djembel Rinch'en. The former of these enjoyed the support of the Chinese, but the latter, who may have been illegitimate, had backers in Chantui. The two struggled over the throne until 1908, when Doje Senkel appealed for assistance to the Chinese General Chao Eh-Feng, who was on military campaign in the area to secure the political primacy of China. Djembel Rinch'en was driven to take sanctuary with the Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso; Doje Senkel yielded the kingdom to China in exchange for an allowance.Coales, 224-225. The Chinese retained direct control of Derge until 1918. The palace of the Derge kings was subsequently converted into a school located next to the Parkhang Monastery.McCue, 241.

Bhojpuri belongs to the Bihari languages of the Eastern zone, and its status as a Hindi language is subject to debate. Inventories Linguists generally distinguish the terms \\"language\\" and \\"dialects\\" on the basis of 'mutual comprehension'. The Indian census uses two specific classifications in a distinctive way: (1) 'language' and (2) 'mother tongue'. The 'mother tongues' are grouped within each 'language'. Many 'mother tongues' so defined would be considered a language rather than a dialect by linguistic standards. This is specifically the case for many 'mother tongues' with tens of millions of speakers that are officially grouped under the 'language' Hindi. Official languages The languages of state administration are Hindi, established by the Uttar Pradesh Official Language Act, 1951, and Urdu, established by the Amendment to the same in 1989.

It is also found in Turkey, on the Tibetan plateau, northern China, eastern and southern Mongolia, and parts of North Korea. In Britain, it is limited to the coast and chalkland areas of southern England. The brown-banded carder bee is similar in appearance to the moss carder bee. As they share similar habitats, care must be taken to distinguish between the two. Description The brown-banded carder bee is medium-sized with a relatively long tongue. The queen is long, the worker . The thorax is usually yellow-orange on top, with beige flanks, but may be dark brown. Most of the abdomen is beige, too, although with a somewhat striped effect. Both queens (the reproductive females) and workers usually have a broad, dark brown band (hence the common name) on the upper side of the abdomen, near the front, although it can be missing on some workers. A few black hairs - may only be one or two ‚Äì are present on the thorax near the wing-bases.Worcestershire Biological Record Males are similar to queens, but they lack stings and have longer antennae.  Colony Cycle  Its flight period lasts from about May to September. The queen emerges from hibernation in the spring and makes a nest on the surface of the ground, preferable among grass tufts. The size of the nest is quite small, usually less than 100 inhabitants. File:Apidae - Bombus humilis ssp. appeninus-001.JPGBombus humilis ssp. appeninus Bombus humilis.jpg Habitat The brown-banded carder bee favours vast grasslands. In Central Asia, it is an alpine species, living at altitudes of . Among the plants visited are Trifolium pratense (red clover), Centaurea (knapweed) and Vicia (vetches). Threats The brown-banded carder bee is threatened by habitat loss due to intensive farming. As Goulson, Hanley, Darvill, Ellis, and Knight have pointed out, a contributing factor in the northern part of its distribution (including Britain) is that B. humilis, being near the edge of its latitudinal range, is not well adapted to local conditions, so is sensitive to habitat changes, especially loss of unimproved grassland meadows.

The birth of the eighth Situpa, Chokyi Jungne, was recorded in many texts and literatures, and many great masters made the prophecies of his arrival. For example, the 11th Karmapa, Yeshe Dorje, ever predicted the place where Chokyi Jungne was born. The eighth Kenting Tai Situpa, Chokyi Jungne (1700‚Äì1774), was born in the province of A-Lo Shega at Atarong as the prophecy. His father was Ngawang Tsering and his mother Tranguma. When Chokyi Jungne was born, lama Kunchen, a master of the Treasure Transmission Lineage, performed Dorje Drolo ceremony for him and gave him the name \\"Gonpo Sun\\". At the age of two, lama Kunchen took him to Tsurphu monastery to see the 11th Karmapa. The Karmapa gave lama Kunchen a silk bag full of big black pills, a pearl with no eye, and a prophecy letter written \\"Situ, the golden dragon, born at A-Lo\\". The 11th Karmapa asked lama Kunchen to offer all these to the incarnation of Kenting Tai Situpa. Chokyi Jungne in consequence was recognized to be the incarnation of the 7th Kenting Tai Situpa. At the age of five, Chokyi Jungne began to learn to read and write Tibetan from his father, and performed a Vajravarahi (Dorje pagmo, Vajra Yogini) ceremony taught by lama Kunchen. At the age of seven, the eighth Shamar Chokyi Dondrup conferred a longevity prayer on him, and conferred the name \\"Situ Chokyi Jungne Trinley Kunkyab Palzangpo\\". At the age of eight, Chokyi Jungne visited the 12th Karmapa Changchub Dorje. At the age of nine, Chokyi Jungne suffered from a serious illness because one relative of his father put poison in his food for sake of jealousy. Two months later, he was on the mend, but he still could not stand or just sit. He lay on the bed and read twice all the literatures in Paljor monastery. At the same time, Chokyi Jungne also learned five knowledge, India local language and Sanskrit. He could communicate with people precisely and fluently in Chinese, Sanskrit, or Mongol. Only a little teaching, he could become skillful in all kind of painting, carving... etc., even better than those who learned these skills for their whole lives. In short, Chokyi Jungne became famous as \\"thorough knowledge\\". At the age of 14, he was recognized according to predictions left by Karmapa Mikyo Dorje, by Terton Sangye Lingpa, Takshampa Mingyur Dorje and by the eighth Shamar Chokyi Dondrup. He was taken to Tsurphu monastery for his enthronement and he received all the teachings and empowerments and studied philosophy and medicine from Karmapa Jangchub Dorje, Shamar Rinpoche, and Rigzin Tsewang Norbu. At the age of 22, Chokyi Jungne convened scholars in He-Le to transcribe Tengyur based on the transcript kept in Chiwa-Datse. After completing the transcribing in two months, he traveled west to Nepal on pilgrimage, discussing knowledge with many scholars. At the age of 23, he visited Ladakh and performed an empowerment for the king and his family. Then, he returned to Paljor monastery. At that period of time, he painted a set of thangkhas of eight mahasiddhas using the style of Gadri school of painting, and offered them to the king of Derge (example right). On the second day of the third month in the female fire sheep year (1727), at the age of 28 years, Chokyi Jungne, under the permission of the king of Derge, he began to found the great Palpung monastery, and accomplished the founding on the tenth day of the eighth month in the year. He also built and restored countless other monasteries throughout his life. Palpung Monastery became the main seat of the Kenting Tai Situpas, and it was the inspiration for the founding of Palpung Sherab Ling Monastery in India by the 12th Kenting Tai Situpa Pema Donyo Nyinjey centuries later. Chokyi Jungne revised texts of Kagyur, Tengyur of Derge transcript, and many literatures in order to make print plates of them. His disciple, Tenpa Tsering, the King of Derge, established the Derge Printing Press. Chokyi Jungne successively helped the Derge Printing Press to produce over 500,000 wood block prints. These prints are such fine quality that the major ones have been reprinted in modern editions and circulated to Tibetan archives in libraries throughout the world. Chokyi Jungne painted a series of thangkhas which descript stories of Buddha Shakyamuni. These thangkhas which were painted in Indian style, decorated with imitated China embroideries, were very different form the existed Gadri school in layout, outline and colors, and called the new Gadri school (Karma Gadri). Chokyi Jungne also painted many other thangkhas and made many sculptures, which all enrich the Tibetan art culture. At the age of 30, Chokyi Jungne went to Tibet for the third time. He visited Tsurphu monastery for the opening of a great statue. Then he stayed in Tibet on pilgrimage and teaching for four years. In the wood mouse year, Chokyi Jungne completed the famous linguistic literature \\"Situ's Commentary of Tibetan Grammar\\". The grammar is still used as senior grammar in Tibet today. In the wood cow year, Chokyi Jungne went to Tibet for the fourth time. He recognized and enthroned the new Shamarpa. Then he visited Nepal again on pilgrimage and was highly honored there. Once, after a debate with Pandita Jaya Mangola of Kashmir, it was proclaimed by the local Hindus that Kenting Tai Situpa must have been blessed by the Lord Shiva, since that was the only way he could have achieved such insight and learning. At the age of 50, according to the Tibetan medical texts Chokyi Jungne made the famous medical pill \\"Moon Nectar Pill\\". In the fire mouse year, he made one kind of special pills which grew themselves more and more and spilled out of the bottle, and then the pills became all kind of Buddha. Afterwards, Chokyi Jungne performed more experiments and made many special pills. He became a skilled physician and a master of Tibetan medicine. He composed and wrote some medical books, which were deemed as valuable medical guidance still now. At the age of 60, The Kenting Tai Situpa visited Jangsadam, south of China, for the second time. In there, he lightened the lamp of Buddha Dharma, rebuilt thirteen monasteries of Kagyu school. In the same period of time, he translated many texts from Sanskrit, including prayers to Bodhisattva Tara. He also visited China at the invitation of the Qianlong Emperor (1735-1796) and was highly honored. At the age of 63, he visited Tibet on pilgrimage for the fifth time. He retreated in a Drikung monastery. At that time, when he performed any kind of offering ceremony, a miracle emanation vision of Dorje Drolo showed up. Once in a Tara fire offering ceremony, the tent he slept grew many blue lotuses. In usual time, he kept reciting mantras except short rest time at noon and night. He recited three hundred million times of all kind of mantras. He showed many miracles like just an intention to stop a rainstorm, spreading barley to the sky and the barley straightened on the ground. He found and recognized the 13th Karmapa Dudul Dorje, and personally taught the Karmapa and imparted the complete lineage to him. At the age of 72, Chokyi Jungne invited the 13th Karmapa Dudul Dorje to Palpung monastery. He performed Taisho Tripitaka lineage empowerments and teachings for the Karmapa. At that time, the sky was filled of colorful clouds, a sacred sign enhancing people's faith to the 13th Karmapa. In 1774, at the age of 74, Chokyi Jungne was invited to China. On the way to China, while meditating in the lotus posture of a Buddha, the Kenting Tai Situpa died. It was observed that his heart- region retained heat for seven days and there was a strong smell of incense everywhere. Kenting Tai Situpa predicted his next rebirth before his passing. The 8th Kenting Tai Situpa was one of the most famous masters in Tibetan history. He was acknowledged as a supreme scholar who had no equal in the five knowledge. He is honored a unique title \\"Maha Pandita\\". His fame reached well beyond the borders of Tibet at this time. He also built or rebuilt many monasteries of different lineages. These monasteries became Palpung's satellite monasteries, even in mainland China, exceeding well beyond a hundred. It is said that his limitless activities were equal to those of Nagajuna's in India. It was also a common saying at the time, that if all of the other Kagyu monasteries came together, their activity wouldn't be equal to that of Situ Chokyi Jungne. His foremost disciples were the thirteenth Karmapa, the tenth Shamarpa, Gyalwang Drukpa Trinley Shingta, Drikung Chokyi Gyalwa, Pawo Tsuklag Gyalwa, Drubtop Choje Gyal, Khamtrul Chokyi Nyima, and Lotsawa Tsewang Kunchab.

In addition to marking the rank and power of certain individuals in Etruscan culture, warfare was a considerable economic boon to Etruscan civilization. Like many ancient societies, the Etruscans conducted campaigns during summer months; raiding neighboring areas, attempting to gain territory and combating piracy as a means of acquiring valuable resources such as land, prestige goods and slaves. It is also likely individuals taken in battle would be ransomed back to their families and clans at high cost. Prisoners could also potentially be sacrificed on tombs to honor fallen leaders of Etruscan society, not unlike the sacrifices made by Achilles for Patroclus.  Significant battles  The Mars of Todi, a life-sized bronze sculpture of a soldier making a votive offering, late 5th to early 4th century BC The written record of the period of Etruscan is fragmentary but it is generally believed that the Etruscans vied with the early Romans for control of the central Italian peninsula for nearly two centuries (c. 700 B.C. ‚Äì c. 500 B.C.) before becoming one of the first neighboring cultures to succumb to Roman expansion. In the Battle of Cumae (474 B.C.), the Etruscans and allies were defeated in the waters off Cumae by the combined navies of Cumae and Syracuse. This defeat successfully blocked the southern expansion of Etruscan influence and marked the beginning of territorial loss in southern Italy. In the Roman‚ÄìEtruscan Wars, Roman authors wrote accounts of a drawn out siege on the city of Veii. According to the Roces, the army of Rome unsuccessfully laid siege to the Etruscan city of Veii for 9 years before they were able to tunnel beneath the walls of the city and bring about Veii's downfall. The veracity of the account is difficult to determine, because the accounts are told as part of the biography of Marcus Furius Camillus, a legendary figure in Roman history. Livy and Plutarch wrote about Camillus long after his death.  Equipment  An Etruscan helmet Etruscan warrior, found near Viterbo, Italy, dated circa 500 BC. In addition to written sources, the archaeological record provides evidence for the Etruscan military and warfare. Tombs of wealthy Etruscans consistently contain either representative sculpture of weaponry and armour, or the items themselves. The varieties of shields, helms, armour and weaponry vary according to date and location, but can still be organized into broad stylistic categories. Several Etruscan shields have been recovered from Etruscan grave sites. The shields are traditionally decorated bronze circular disks measuring around a yard across. Earlier Etruscan shields are flat and later examples have a slightly convex curve across the body of the shield. The later styles bear close resemblance to contemporary Greek models. There are several helmet designs found at Etruscan sites, the most distinctively Etruscan being the so-called ‚Äúcrested helm‚Äù variety. The crest is fashioned by joining two embossed plates (or laminae) into a high peak pointed crest. The high crest is frequently embossed with decoration. In addition to the Crested Helm a number of other varieties of helms have been found in Etruscan tombs. Often the design is a semi-spherical cap, with no decoration or with appliques. Another variation to the common semispherical cap is cheek guards attached by hinges. Both swords and spears are frequently found at Etruscan tomb sites. Few examples of Etruscan swords survive in good condition, often only fragments of heavily oxidized blades. What does survive are generally robust spear points and wide blades not unlike early Roman weaponry. The bronze armour of the Etruscans is similar in style to that of the Greeks. One example from Tarquinia was two solid pieces connected by hinges at the hips and on either side of the neck. The example was anatomical in design, meaning the bronze plates were fashioned to look like the chest and back of a robust man. Another example from the Narce Tombs, northwest of the city of Rome, was from an earlier date and decorated like the Crested Helm. The Narce Tomb breast plate evidently would have restricted the range of motion considerable more and has led to hypotheses that it was intended for a stationary commander. Anatomical greaves have also been found in Etruscan tombs. Some of what is known about the arms and armour of the Etruscans is not based on actual equipment but rather sculpted duplicates. \\"The Tomb of Reliefs\\" at Cerveteri is a rock-hewn tomb with relief and stucco relief work painted to look as if the dead would be provided with all necessary goods to live comfortably in the tomb. This tomb provides a great deal of beneficial insight to the several types of Etruscan material culture including weapons. Among the decorations were a number of life sized weapons, items of armour and shields. References and further reading * B.

It allows data from IBM Notes and Relational Databases to be displayed to browser clients on all platforms. The programming model is based on web development languages and standards including JavaScript, Ajax, Java, the Dojo Toolkit, Server-side JavaScript and JavaServer Faces. XPages uses IBM Domino, IBM's rapid application development platform, including functionality such as the document-oriented database. Frontend technologies  By utilizing web standards, XPages applications can be accessed by web clients and mobile devices, allowing the developer to deliver cross-platform applications. For the user interface, XPages focus on the web development standards HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally themes can be used to manage multiple CSS files,\\"Make your XPage Apps \\"Pop!\\" withCSS and Themes\\" and XPages comes with default themes, for example the OneUI theme.OneUI theme For client side logic various JavaScript frameworks can be used, though XPages comes with the Dojo Toolkit and Dojo controls can be easily referenced in XPages applications. XPages also uses Dojo internally for certain functionality to make key features easier to use without having to write Dojo code. A special XPages JavaScript library contains further convenience functionality, for example for client side field validations.XPages JavaScript library In addition to client side logic Dojo can also be used for rich user interface widgets and charts.Dojo toolkit As any web application XPages applications can use REST services. XPages also provides easy mechanisms to bind data sources to UI controls so that for many scenarios no code needs to be written. Additionally XPages allows to declaratively only refresh parts of the page via Ajax when submitting data. Backend technologies The development of XPages applications is done using IBM Domino Designer. With Designer many key scenarios can be implemented declaratively and rapidly, for example to render a list of entries from a database. Additionally for the business logic both JavaScript and Java code can be written. XPages base internally on JavaServer Faces, but the sources of a XPages pages are an XML derivative called XSP which is translated into Java code when running the applications. At runtime, this code returns the HTML to various clients. In order to access data, XPages and Domino Designer use data sources. These data sources can be bound graphically to UI controls on pages. UI controls and other types of controls show up in a palette of controls in Domino Designer and can be dragged and dropped onto pages. Domino Designer also comes with further convenience functionality, such as field validations and translations. XPages functionality can be modularized in Custom Controls which are XPages controls that can be reused in multiple XPages pages and parametrized based on context. In order to write business backend code Serverside JavaScript is used primarily. There are APIs to access the document oriented database and the XPages context.APIs reference Since XPages are based on JSF and JSF is a Java standard it is also possible to invoke standard Java SDK code from the JavaScript code and to write custom Java code using JSF managed beans. The XPages runtime can be extended using the Extensibility API which is based on JavaServer Faces.XPages Extensibility API This capability can for example be used by ISVs who want to provide their own libraries of XPages controls. Storage: Document-oriented Database The XPages runtime is part of IBM Domino and leverages the proven and mature capabilities Domino provides. Domino uses a document-oriented database called NSF (Notes Storage Facility) to manage semi-structured data like rich text and files. The data is stored as documents and views allow finding specific documents efficiently.The document oriented database is a core part of the Domino architecture. Note that these two referenced PDF documents are old but still give a good overview of the fundamental concepts. Documents have unique ids and further built in fields like the last author, last modified date, etc. and they have custom application specific fields. Documents can contain rich text which can be formatted text and images (MIME) or full file attachments. Documents can be queried via APIs and views.Java classes A-Z Domino also supports full text search for a full database as built in feature. XPages applications can be deployed on Domino servers or a cluster of Domino servers using IBM Domino Administrator and the replication/synchronization mechanism built into IBM Domino. The replication mechanism supports bi-directional conflict detection and resolution in distributed environments. Community XPages.info The XPages development community manages the website XPages.info with various types of information about XPages, including how to get started, downloads, resources and demos. OpenNTF is an open source site for applications based on IBM Domino and contains several applications and development controls under the Apache License. History The origins of XPages technology can be traced as far back as year 2000, when Trilog Group, an IBM Business Partner, invented a component-oriented rapid web application development model, called XSP, similar to the Domino RAD model, but based on J2EE, XML and open standards. In August 2004, IBM acquired the XSP technology assets from Trilog Group in an effort to offer a RAD tool for IBM Workplace that is similar to Domino Designer. The XPages technology, based upon JSF and J2EE, started life at IBM, from 2005 to 2007, inside the now discontinued IBM Lotus Workplace Designer and subsequently IBM Lotus Component Designer under the code name 'XFaces'. In mid 2007, the XFaces technology became 'XPages' and adopted by IBM Lotus Notes Domino, incorporated in the development cycle for the 8.5 release. XPages was previewed at Lotusphere 2008 (AD303 Transforming IBM Lotus Domino Web Apps with IBM Lotus Domino Designer Speakers: Rocky Oliver, Martin Donnelly). IBM Lotus Notes Domino 8.5 was released in December 2008 and in time for Lotusphere 2009 where it was one of the many highlights of the show. IBM Lotus Notes Domino 8.5.1 continued the development of the XPages technology including the running of XPages applications inside the Notes Client. This release also included several improvements to performance and UI which helped XPages applications perform and scale better. IBM Lotus Notes Domino 8.5.2 contained many more improvements and additions to the feature set of XPages. The 'XPages' name was inspired from the original XSP naming idea, where XSP was actually an acronym for 'XML Server Pages'. After a first rebranding of XSP to 'XFaces', IBM chose 'XPages' as the project code name for the pre- release technology included in Domino Designer. With a catchy alternative being hard to come by, the project name stuck.

It gives the developer a full-blown scripting language (Ruby) while writing their build scripts, which are usually missing in XML-based building environments such as Apache Ant or Apache Maven. __NOTOC__ Overview Buildr is based on Ruby's build system Rake, and uses Ruby as a scripting language. It uses several project automation idioms from Maven like automated artifact management (Buildr is out-of-box compatible with Maven's repositories). As opposed to the more imperative style of build systems like Ant, Buildr takes a more declarative approach in describing the project automation logic (similarly to Maven). Though Buildr's general philosophy is similar to Maven, it uses Ruby's scripting possibilities to provide a more flexible and customizable programming model. The user writes a Ruby build script, declaring a project, its sub-projects, artifacts, dependencies, packaging rules, etc. Based on these declarations, a list of standard targets are provided to compile or package the project, upload a prepared package to a remote repository, clean up the build results, run tests and so on. Hooks are provided to execute custom Ruby code before or after the standard targets, allowing the user to comfortably override any defaults and further specify the behavior of the standard targets. New, completely user-written targets can be added. Supported technologies While being mainly designed for Java, Buildr also knows how to invoke compilers for Groovy or Scala. It is also easily extendible with any custom tasks to invoke any third compiler, making it a universal, general-purpose build system. As compared with writing custom plug- ins for Ant, Ruby's flexibility and rich library make it easier and quicker to extend Buildr in any desired way. Buildr also comes with out-of-box support technologies like Cobertura, Emma, JUnit, TestNG, JBehave, JMock. Integration with Ant is also provided.
