It was demolished when shore erosion threatened to topple it. History This was one of the earliest lights in Washington, and was constructed along the same pattern as the Smith Island Light. At the time the bay was still called Shoalwater Bay, and the lighthouse took the same name. Supplying the site was problematic, and the light was extinguished from 1859 to 1861. Eventually a lifesaving station was built immediately to the east. In 1889 the area was renamed Willapa Bay after a local tribe. The entrance to the bay is extremely unstable, and the sandy cape on which the lighthouse stood was steadily eroded away. By the late 1930s, the foundations of the building were affected, and it was abandoned in 1938. By the 1940, it threatened to fall over the cliff on which it was perched, and the coast guard dynamited it, viewing it as a threat to the many bystanders come to see the precariously perched building. It was succeeded by various towers, but relentless erosion caused discontinuance of the light between 1991 and 1993. The same erosion also claimed some four square miles of North Cove, Washington, on the coast adjacent to the lighthouse, as well as the lifesaving station.

Pulaka, (cyrtosperma merkusii), or swamp taro, is an important source of carbohydrates. Rice now forms an important part of the diet. Coconut is used in different forms with coconut water, coconut milk and the flesh of the coconut being used to flavour dishes. Various desserts made on the islands include coconut and coconut milk, instead of animal milk. Traditional foods of Tuvalu The traditional foods eaten in Tuvalu are pulaka, which is a \\"swamp crop\\" similar to taro, but \\"with bigger leaves and larger, coarser roots\\", bananas, breadfruit and coconut. Tuvaluans also eat seafood, including coconut crab, fish from the lagoon and ocean, seabirds (taketake or black noddy and akiaki or white tern) and also pork. Seafood provides protein. Bananas and breadfruit are supplemental crops. Coconut is used for its juice, to make other beverages and to improve the taste of some dishes. Pork is eaten mostly at fateles (or parties with dancing to celebrate certain events). Agriculture in Tuvalu is focused on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large pits of composted soil below the water table, Pulaka is the main source for carbohydrates. Pulaka makes up the bulk of the islanders' traditional diet; it is usually supplemented by fish. Since the unprocessed corms are toxic, they must always be cooked, usually in an earth oven. Many of the recipes call for the addition of coconut cream or toddy, or both. On Niutao, coconut cream (lolo) is poured over beaten pulp of pulaka, to make a dish called tulolo. A similar dish on Nukufetau, with halved corms, is called tulolo pulaka; with beaten corms the dish is called fakapapa. Fekei is made on all the islands, and consists of pulaka which is grated (typically this is woman's work) with the aid of limestone with holes drilled in it. The resulting pulp is wrapped in pulaka leaves and steamed, and mixed with coconut cream. Influences on the cuisine of Tuvalu Because these islands are isolated, the neighbors' influences are not felt in the Tuvaluan cuisine. Because Tuvalu was a British colony during the 19th century, the Tuvalu cuisine includes British elements and meals with the local flavors. The pulaka pits are at risk from increasing sea levels, which increase saltwater levels subsoil in the atolls and islands of Tuvalu. Besides rising saltwater levels, \\"changing lifestyles and eating habits\\" also threaten the cultivation of the crop, a process that began during and after World War II, when American occupying troops supplied the islands with imported foods and many pulaka pits were no longer maintained. Imported foods are often high in sugar, leading also to an increase in the need for dental care. The Tuvaluans benefited from the canned food supplied by the American forces, although the change in diet continued after the war, which resulted in long term impacts on health. Tuvaluans adopted a diet that includes high levels of corned beef, rice and sugar. This food is consumed even when fish and traditional vegetables are available. This diet is believed to contribute to increasing levels of diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases among Tuvaluans. Variations in diet The diets on Tuvalu's nine widely-spread islands varies, but they are all based on seafood, fish meals and local plants, such as taro. Most of the population is concentrated on the Funafuti Island and even though this is very small, the cuisine there is most representative for all the state. In the capital, Funafuti, the seafood dishes and meats are more common than the mashed vegetables or soups, while in outer islands, the taro is the staple aliment and it is considered to be multi-functional: there is the taro leaf and coconut soup, taro leaf au gratin, taro chips, taro cakes and palusami - all these are meals that can be found in Hawaii, too. The palusami, also called the samoa is a dish which is served with taro or breadfruit and it is made of taro leaves (which can be replaced with spinach), coconut cream, lime juice, onions and spices.

From the 1960s to the 1980s, he was a figure in the development of the two-party system in West Texas. In 1978, he lost the Republican nomination to future U.S. President George W. Bush for Texas' 19th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives. Bush was then defeated in the 1978 general election by the then Democrat, later Republican, Kent Hance. Background An only child, Reese was born to Arvil Lloyd Reese (1911-1980) and the former Mary Louise Pearce (1910-1990) in the defunct community of Hasse in Comanche County near Abilene, Texas. The Reese family moved repeatedly during Jim's childhood as Arvil searched for employment amid the Great Depression. Arvil worked for the Texas Department of Highways for a time, having been assigned to place finish concrete on bridges. He also held various jobs in the oil industry and was during the end of his working years a Butane dealer in Gustine in Comanche County. During his boyhood, Jim Reese attended eighteen different schools and resided in such locations as Sidney in Comanche County, Bronte in Coke County, Monahans, Brady, Corpus Christi and Odessa, Texas, as well as McAlester, Oklahoma.Billy Hathorn, \\"Mayor Jim Reese of Odessa and the Republican Party in the Permian Basin\\", The West Texas Historical Association Year Book, Vol. LXXXVII (October 2011), p. 127. Reese's first remembrance of Odessa dates to 1938, when he was eight years of age. Arvil Reese had hired a driver with a pickup truck to bring the family of three to Odessa. Young Jim saw flares from the oil fields and smelled sour gas: \\"I had heard of hell but didn't expect to get there that soon,\\" he quipped. He slept on hay in the back of the pickup that first night, thirty years before his election as mayor. Reese recalls that in the late 1930s there was no paving in Odessa past Grant and Eighth streets. For several weeks the family lived in a tourist cabin in Goldsmith in Ector County, where they survived a tornado. It was while the Reeses were residing in Brady further east in McCulloch County that Arvil was financially able to purchase the family's first vehicle, a Model T. The car had been used to haul chickens in the back seat, but \\"we were happy finally to have transportation,\\" Reese remembers.Reese, p. 127. Back in Comanche County, Reese graduated at sixteen from Gustine High School and enrolled at the Southern Baptist-affiliated Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas, for two years before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin, where in 1951 he obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The next year, he procured the Master of Arts from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Both degrees were in the then new field of radio and television broadcasting. From 1953 o 1955, he served in the United States Air Force and was stationed mostly in San Antonio, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, and at the former Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas. He also made a brief military sojourn to Tripoli, Libya.Reese, p. 128. Reese was married until her death to the former Jayne Damron (May 31, 1930 - March 21, 2016), the daughter of Joe Sam Damron and the former Colleen Tidwell. Born in Amarillo and reared in Muleshoe in Bailey County, she graduated from Muleshoe High School and attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and the University of Texas at Austin. Their daughter, Greta Jayne Reese Rigney (born 1954), resides in Midland. Her husband, William R. Rigney, Jr. (1945-2013), was a native of Oakland, California, who worked in both baseball management, which brought him to Midland, and then the oil business. He died at the age of sixty-eight of Alzheimer's disease. There are three Rigney sons, Jim Reese's grandsons.William \\"Bill\\" Rigney obituary, The Odessa American, December 1, 2013. The Reeses' son, James Rockney \\"Rocky\\" Reese (born 1956) lives in Horseshoe Bay near Austin, Texas. A second daughter, Lori Jan Reese (1962-2011) resided until her death in Abilene at the Abilene State School for special-needs persons.Reese, pp. 130, 148. Broadcasting career Reese's broadcasting career began at KCBD-TV, Channel 11, the NBC affiliate in Lubbock. He then moved go KFDA-TV, the CBS affiliate in Amarillo, followed by KMID-TV, at the time a combined NBC/ABC outlet in Midland, Texas, with studios at the former Air Force building at Midland Airfield. Reese then relocated to Odessa, where he was an anchorman from 1956 to 1964 at KOSA-TV, Channel 7, the CBS station which after a change in ownership relocated its facilities in 2000 to Music City Mall.Reese, p. 128 KOSA formerly used the mantra \\"Your Eye on West Texas.\\"\\"KOSA: Your Eye on West Texas\\" and today uses \\"The Breaking News and Weather Authority\\", Website: Cbs7kosa.com, accessed November 10, 2010. At Reese Air Force Base, Reese had edited the military newspaper and handled the Saturday evening and Sunday morning shifts at KCBD-TV, the latter at a gross salary of $1.15 per hour. In Lubbock, Reese attempted to develop from his residence a weekly detailed television schedule for the South Plains based on Walter Annenberg's TV Guide magazine that had been launched successfully on the East Coast at that time.Reese, p. 128. However, station manager Joseph H. BryantJoseph Bryant (1916-1996), formerly of Oklahoma, was still residing in Odessa at the time of his death. Social Security Death Index. Website: ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com [Accessed November 12, 2010] forbade moonlighting. Faced with the lack of choice, Reese resigned and moved to KFDA in Amarillo. After some two months, he recalls having been dropped from the station in a budget crunch. He turned down an offer to be a television director in Fort Worth, Texas, to come to KMID, which offered him $10 more per week than what the Fort Worth station had tendered. At KMID, he was not only the sports anchor but did commercials.Reese, pp. 128-129. KMID, now exclusively an ABC affiliate, Channel 2, was the first television station in Midland-Odessa.\\"ABC 2 ‚Äì KMID Channel 2,\\" Website: stationindex.com, accessed November 10, 2010. While at the Odessa Country Club, Reese met the assistant manager of the club, Lew Allen, a musician.Lew Allen was a stage name of the late Allyn Llue Lewallen, who had previously played piano in Kansas City, Missouri. The two co-produced a half-hour mid-afternoon daily variety show on KMID which aired after the popular reality show Queen for a Day,Reese, p. 129. hosted by Jack Bailey.Jack Bailey (1907-1980), an Iowa native who had been active in vaudeville and was once a World's Fair barker, was at the peak of his television career when Queen for a Day began an eight-year network run on January 3, 1956. The series aired for four and a half seasons on NBC and then four more on ABC. Critics later said that the program was demeaning to women because it forced them to reveal personal hardships to a national audience. In 1955, KMID general manager Ray Herndon moved the Allen-Reese program to 5:30 p.m., and without the Queen for a Day lead-in audience, it languished, as Reese had expected. Reese left KMID and accepted a longstanding offer in the summer of 1956 from program director and first KOSA station manager, John Joseph Vacca, Jr., (1922-2003) a native of Chicago,Reese, p. 129. who served on the Odessa City Council from 1962 to 1964 prior to Reese's tenure as mayor.Confirmed by Odessa City Secretary Norma Grimaldo, November 15, 2010. Coincidentally, Vacca had also attended Reese's alma mater, Northwestern University.John J. Vacca was residing in Lewisville, Texas, at the time of his death in 2003. In 1967, he became vice president of the Trigg Vaughn group of radio and television stations. In Dallas/Fort Worth, he directed the construction of KDTV, Channel 39, the first UHF television station in the Metroplex.

KOSA went on the air in Odessa on January 1, 1956. Reese resumed the variety show there, announced the 10 p.m. sports news, and prepared scores of commercials. He found that his recognition from being a sports anchor made it easier to sell advertising. Even after switching stations for the last time he never managed to publish his envisioned West Texas version of TV Guide.Reese, p. 129. In Odessa, Reese covered three high school teams, the Odessa Broncos, the Permian Panthers, and the Ector Eagles. At the time, the Odessa Jackalopes of the Central Hockey League had not been organized.The Jackalopes, organized in 1997, plays at the Ector County Coliseum on the Andrews Highway. The Coliseum seats some 5,100. KOSA also covered teams in Midland, Monahans, and Big Spring in Howard County, whenever those games were of particular interest to Odessa. Reese learned the names of each player and compiled a sheet of statistical notes which he taped to the back of the camera. This method created his own home-made Teleprompter which allowed him to report to the audience without being seen glancing at a script. He further covered national sports news of area interest sent to KOSA through the telegraph ticker from the news-gathering agencies.Reese, pp. 129-130. Civic leadership Though he was earning a good salary through his sales commissions at KOSA, Reese left the station after eight years because of his growing involvement with the Junior Chamber International, a civic organization founded in 1920 in St. Louis, Missouri, and widely known as the Jaycees. After undergoing six months of training, he became a stockbroker and joined the Eppler, Guerin & Turner brokerage firm in Odessa, renamed in 1994 Principal Financial Securities, Inc.\\"The Principal/Eppler, Guerin & Turner, Inc., Becomes Principal Financial Securities, Inc.,\\" April 4, 1994, Website: highbeam.com, accessed November 10, 2010. The new career gave Reese greater flexibility of schedule to pursue his interest in the Jaycees. Reese recalls his Jaycees years as having taught him more than he had learned in six years of university education, particularly the club focus on \\"Leadership Training Through Community Development.\\"Reese, p. 130. He worked to bring the former Harlem Magicians basketball entertainment team to Odessa, an event which filled the Broncos Field House on Whitaker Street.\\"Harlem Magicians,\\" Hoopedia, Website: nba.com accessed November 10, 2010. In 1962, the Jaycees attempted to land the Miss Texas Pageant in Odessa but lost out to Fort Worth.Miss Texas 1962, Penny Lee Rudd of Waskom, competed in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for the Miss America title, won by Jacquelyn Mayer (born 1942) of Ohio. \\"Jacquelyn Mayer with Bert Parks and Miss Texas 1962,\\" Ohio Pix, Website: ohiohistory.org. [Accessed November 10, 2010] Reese approached the Ector County Commission and proposed the air conditioning of the Coliseum, which had been built eight years earlier in 1954. He argued that the city could with air conditioning attract a greater variety of events. \\"We didn't get the pageant, but we got the Coliseum air conditioned,\\" Reese recalls. In 1963, the Odessa Jaycees won the designation as the outstanding club in the state.Reese, p. 130. In 1964, Reese ran unsuccessfully for state Jaycees president at the state convention in Fort Worth but instead was named first vice president. The next year he became state president by acclamation. He left KOSA because the co-owner and general manager, Cecil L. Trigg, later partner of the Dallas-based Trigg Vaughn chain of radio and television stations, told Reese that the Jaycees presidency would require too much time from his station duties. Therefore, Reese resigned from KOSA, switched to the brokerage business, and never looked back at broadcasting.Reese, pp. 130-131. On a Jaycees trip to Washington, D.C., Reese met former U.S. Representative Brooks Hays, an Arkansas Democrat who was an assistant to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. A theologically and politically liberal figure within the Southern Baptist Convention,Terry D. Goddard, \\"Southern Social Justice: Brooks Hays (1898-1981) and the Little Rock School Crisis,\\" Baptist History and Heritage (Spring 2003), Website: findarticles.com, accessed November 11, 2010. Hays acquired national attention in 1958 when he was defeated for reelection by a write-in candidate, the ophthalmologist and former radio announcer Dale Alford because of Hays' support for the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock.James D. Baker, Brooks Hays (Macon, Georgia: Mercer University Press, 1989), pp. 71-102.In 1966, Hays resigned from Johnson's staff to run unsuccessfully for the Arkansas Democratic gubernatorial nomination but lost to James D. Johnson, who was then defeated by the Republican Winthrop Rockefeller. Reese recalls that Hays told the Jaycees that Washington had become powerful in relation to the states because national leaders can at an objective distance usually make more accurate professional decisions than can local people directly involved in civic matters. Reese describes the Hays philosophy as totally counter to his own conservative, decentralized approach to public matters.Reese, p. 131. On that same trip to Washington, Reese met President Johnson, Teamsters President James Hoffa, and future U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., then a U.S. representative from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Some ten years later, Reese would be running for Congress on the ticket with Ford and vice-presidential running-mate, U.S. Senator Robert J. Dole of Kansas, but all went down to defeat at the hands of the Democrats Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, and George H. Mahon.Reese, pp. 131-132. In 1965-1966, before Reese reached the maximum departure age of thirty-six from the Jaycees, he was named vice president of the national organization at the convention in Buffalo, New York. He was assigned to monitor Jaycee activities in five states: Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Texas. He was also named to formulate the Jaycees \\"government affairs\\" portfolio, having worked in that endeavor with conservative activist Clymer Wright, a former newspaper publisher from Fort Bend and Harris counties who in 1991 worked successfully to establish municipal term limits in Houston, Texas.Reese, p. 132Clymer Wright was one of the unsuccessful Republican candidates in the 1993 special election for the U.S. Senate to fill the seat vacated earlier by Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., who became United States Secretary of the Treasury in the Bill Clinton administration. Like Jim, Reese, Wright had been a Reagan backer since 1968. In 1982, Wright launched a campaign to convince Reagan to fire the Houstonian James Baker as the White House chief of staff. Reagan not only retained Baker but later elevated him to the position of secretary of the treasury. Reese served as president of the Odessa Young Men's Christian Association. At the time Odessa was the largest U.S. city not to have a YMCA. So a capital campaign was launched to build the modern facility on University Boulevard. The land was donated by the firm Houston Endowment of Houston, Texas.Reese, p. 132. Odessa oilman Bill No√´l, a Fort Worth native who had been named in 1963 as \\"Outstanding Citizen of Odessa,\\"\\"Noel, William Douglas\\" (1914-1987), Handbook of Texas on-line, Website: tshaonline.org/handbook/online, [Accessed November 13, 2010] headed the drive to tap large donors.

Reese describes Shepperd as \\"the best organizer I ever knew. He started his meetings at 7 a.m. when most could not devise an excuse to avoid attending fundraising activities.Reese, p. 132. The mayoral years In 1968, Odessa Mayor Preston Parker (1911-1979) who lived two houses from Reese, announced that he would not seek reelection. Backed by his former associates in the Jaycees, Reese entered the race against one opponent, the Odessa mayor pro-tempore, E. P. \\"Jack\\" Rainosek (1906-1984), who later relocated to Cross Plains in Callahan County near Abilene, Texas.Reese, p. 132 The nonpartisan election was held on April 2, 1968, two days after President Johnson announced that he would not seek a second full term in the White House, but Reese discounts any impact that national matters may have had on the Odessa race. Reese defeated Rainosek, 7,179 (86 percent) to 1,139 (14 percent),City of Odessa, Texas, Municipal election returns, April 2, 1968. and confessed that he would not have campaigned so rigorously had he known that his margin would have been that lopsided.Reese, p. 133. Mayor Reese and the city council quickly replaced the city manager, Weir Routh, who supervised seventeen departments and was, according to Reese, reluctant to delegate authority to subordinates. Reese later recommended Routh for the city manager's position in the smaller city of Alvin near Houston. The new manager, Ronald Neighbors, had previously been in the same position in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton.Reese, p. 133. Reese recalls Odessa as a \\"growing city\\" requiring street pavement, the extension of sewer lines, and plans for managed growth. When sanitation workers went on strike, Reese went to their workplace and told them, \\"If you'll go back to work, we'll figure out something\\" to relieve their back-breaking work and low wages. As a result, Odessa began the use of dumpsters placed in an alley or along the streets with mechanically-embellished trucks lifting the plastic waste receptacle with a forklift and depositing the garbage and trash into the truck bed, usually equipped with a compactor.Reese, p. 133 This technology was first advanced in the 1950s in Knoxville, Tennessee, by brothers with the unlikely name of Dempster. Two large metal arms grab the standardized container, lift it over the cab, and tip the garbage into the hopper.\\"A Brief History of the Dumpster,\\" Website: hubpages.com/hub/Haulingportlandor, accessed November 15, 2010. That system is now universal in most cities, as workers ride in the comfort of air-conditioned cabs and rarely leave the truck while on their errands. Technology hence relieved the workers of past drudgery. Reese recalls that Odessa was the first city in his region to utilize the new technology.Reese, p. 133. In the Reese years, Country Club Estates in east Odessa was annexed to the city. The cable company president told Reese that he could not offer service to the new subdivision because of distance and cost. Reese replied that the city would find another cable carrier who could handle all of Odessa. When faced with the loss of its market, the company relented and wired cable to the new subdivision.Reese, pp. 133-134. Odessa created an industrial development district in the southwestern part of the city. To maintain competitiveness, the industries there are exempt from charging their customers the municipal sales tax. Because the industries use municipal utilities and facilities, however, they make a \\"payment in lieu of taxes\\" to the city. Reese's own firm, Panatek Industries, Ltd., is located in the industrial district, the largest inland petrochemical complex in the United States. Most such districts are near the seacoast.Reese, p. 134. On April 1, 1970, Mayor Reese secured for Odessa the first 9-1-1 telephone service in Texas, established through Southwestern Bell. Reese had earlier been alerted to the value of 911 from a constituent, Tommy R. Gregory, who told the mayor about the installation in 1968 of the first such emergency system in the United States in Haleyville in Winston County in northern Alabama.Reese, p. 134\\"New Emergency Number Scheduled for Odessa,\\" The Odessa American, March 30, 1970, 1-B. Reese earned $100 per month as mayor, having viewed the part-time position like that of a \\"volunteer\\" who found satisfaction in civic promotion. He faced minimal opposition for his second and third terms in 1970 and 1972. He did not seek a fourth two-year term in 1974 and was succeeded in the position by city council member Daniel B. Hemphill (1918-2003), a partisan Democrat who prevailed in a low-turnout nonpartisan municipal electionReese, p. 134 held on April 2, 1974, with 2,970 votes (75 percent) over three opponents.City of Odessa, Texas, Municipal election returns, April 2, 1974. The last two years of Reese's term as mayor of Odessa overlapped with the first term of Midland Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., another pioneer in the development of the Republican Party in West Texas. Midland and Odessa had considerable rivalry at that time. Reese said that the \\"animosity was misdirected.\\" Reese, p. 134. A dispute developed over the proposed location of the University of Texas of the Permian Basin. The consensus had been to build the institution near the Midland-Ector county line. However, the Midland National Bank and First National Bank of Midland each had different sites in mind. Ultimately, UTPB was built in northern Odessa west of Interstate 20 without the input of the Midland business community.Reese, pp. 134-135. The two cities continue to operate separate community colleges. Challenging George Mahon Representative George Mahon, a native of the Mahon community near Homer in Claiborne Parish in North Louisiana, was the longtime powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, known for bringing public works projects to West Texas, including Interstate 27, which links Amarillo with Lubbock. He had begun his career as a prosecutor in Colorado City in Mitchell County before relocating with his wife, Helen,Reese, p. 135At the time of her death, Helen Mahon (1900-1987) had returned to live in Colorado City, in Mitchell County, Texas. Social Security Death Index to Lubbock, the largest city in the 19th District. Mahon was so revered in Mitchell County that his bust has been placed on the courthouse lawn in Colorado City. The federal courthouse and a municipal park in Lubbock are named for Mahon; the downtown public library there is named for George and Helen Mahon.\\"Mahon, George Herman (1900-1985)\\", Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-Present, Website:congress.gov. [Accessed November 11, 2010] Bill G. Elms, the second Republican to serve on the Ector County Commission during roughly the same time frame that Reese was the Odessa mayor, recalls Reese having asked him to manage the congressional race against Mahon. Elms, however, declined because he, despite partisan factors, favored the reelection of Mahon.Reese, p. 135A native of Savanna in Pittsburg County in southeastern Oklahoma, Bill G. Elms (died November 7, 2012) was a Certified Public Accountant and rancher in Burkett in Ector County, Texas. John Gizzi of the national conservative weekly Human Events later described Reese's challenge of Mahon as \\"Herculean\\" because the House Appropriations Committee chairman had not even faced a nominal Republican opponent since 1964,John Gizzi, \\"Politics 2004: The Week of December 27\\", Human Events, January 4, 2005, humanevents.com/article.php?id=6194, [Accessed January 27, 2011] when he defeated Joe B. Phillips (1925-2012) of Lubbock, 87,555 to 25,243.Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections (Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly Press, 2010), p. 1275 Phillips was later a leader in the right-to-life movement. As one of what Gizzi called \\"Reagan's Raiders,\\" Reese expected to receive the support of Gerald Ford, who ran for a term of his own as president in the same election. Ford had pledged to support all Republican congressional candidates. When Ford came to Lubbock, Reese was invited to ride with the president in the limousine from the airport to the political rally on the Texas Tech campus. Then Reese learned that Ford had undercut him by inviting Mahon, not Reese, to sit on the platform of dignitaries.Reese, p. 135. Mahon and Reese met in debate in a Lubbock city park sponsored by the League of Women Voters. In the exchange, Reese said that Mahon had voted on August 9, 1975, for a congressional pay hike from $42,500 to $44,600, effective October 1, 1975, the beginning of another federal fiscal year.Ida A. Brudnick, \\"Salaries of Members of Congress: A List of Payable Rates and Effective Dates, 1789-2008\\": https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/97-1011.pdf Mahon replied that he had not voted to raise his own pay. The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal later found that Mahon had voted for higher congressional pay and thus verified Reese's contention. Reese said he believed that Mahon simply forgot about the vote in question.Reese, pp. 135-136. Reese greatly expanded the showing by Joe Phillips a dozen years earlier and finished with 72,991 votes (45.4 percent); Mahon prevailed with 87,908 ballots (54.6 percent) in a nationally Democratic year.Congressional Quarterly's Guide, p. 1305 Reese said that he might have prevailed had all of Ector County then been within the 19th District. At the time, no more than a third of Ector County, which Reese swept, was within the district boundaries.Reese, p. 136. Years later, Reese described Mahon as \\"a fine gentleman\\" but claimed that the veteran congressman had long severed direct ties to the 19th District and retained his Washington residence after his retirement in 1979. At the time of the 1976 campaign, Mahon's district address was a post office box in the Lubbock federal building since named for Mahon.Reese, p. 136. In the summer of 1977, Mahon announced that he would not seek a 23rd term in Congress. Reese said that he believes that Mahon decided not to run again because he wished to avoid a second consecutive draining, competitive race against a Republican candidate. There was also the sense that Texas was either closely divided or leaning Republican in the mid-term elections of the Jimmy Carter presidency, as exhibited by the last reelection of Senator John Tower and the first Republican gubernatorial victory since 1869, with the triumph of Bill Clements. As of 2016, Carter remains the last Democrat to have won the electoral votes of Texas, for Reagan's 1980 Texas triumph marked the first of a full generation of at least ten consecutive Republican presidential victories in the Lone Star State.Reese, p. 136. Challenging George W. Bush After Mahon's retirement announcement, 31-year- old George Walker Bush quickly launched his own campaign for the seat. Bush's grandfather was the U.S. Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut.\\"Bush, Prescott Sheldon,\\" Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-Present His father, President George Herbert Walker Bush, is also a former Houston- area congressman, a one-time United States Ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and United States Ambassador to China. At the CIA, the senior Bush had worked with Mahon, his former congressional colleague, even though the retiring appropriations committee chairman had lost much of his oversight over intelligence matters through changes in the congressional committee process.Central Intelligence Agency, \\"George Bush: Calm Between Storm\\", posted 2007: https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of- intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/directors-of-central- intelligence-as-leaders-of-the-u-s-intelligence-community/chapter_7.htm Like his father, the younger Bush drew the support of the Republican \\"establishment,\\" with Reese in the role of the \\"populist\\" dissenter, akin to Ronald Reagan's challenge of Gerald Ford two years earlier for the party's presidential nomination. Reese had supported Reagan in that exchange in which the Californian ultimately secured all one hundred Texas delegates at the party's national convention held in the Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri.Reese, p. 137 Reese said that Bush's campaign literature which proclaimed him as having been \\"born July 6, 1946, and raised in Midland, Texas\\" was misleading because of Bush's birth in New Haven, Connecticut, and the Bush generational family's ties to East Coast Republicans. Reese also questioned the membership of the senior George Bush in the Trilateral Commission,Reese, p. 137. a group founded in 1973 with the goal of \\"a new international economic order.\\"Trilateral Commission membership ‚Äì 2008, Website: augustreview.com, accessed November 11, 2010. He scolded \\"Junior Bush,\\" as he called him despite the variation of middle names, of being a \\"Rockefeller-type Republican\\" who had supported Gerald Ford in the 1976 nomination fight against Ronald Reagan.Reese, p. 137. The senior Bush, out of the country at the time of the Reagan-Ford rivalry, later expressed dismay at Reagan's involvement in the congressional primary: \\"I am not interesting in getting into an argument with Reagan. But I am surprised about what he is doing here, in my state. ... They are making a real effort to defeat George.\\"Lois Romano and George Lardner, Jr., \\"Young Bush, a Political Natural Revs Up,\\" Washington Post, July 29, 1999, A1. When George W. Bush was asked about the close ties of all the 19th District Republican candidates to the petroleum industry, he replied, \\"There's no such thing as being too closely aligned with the oil industry in West Texas.\\"Washington Post, July 29, 1999. The presence of a third candidate, Joe Hickox, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel from Lubbock, prevented an outright winner from being nominated in the May 6 primary.Reese, p. 138Washington Post, July 29, 1999. Bush led 6,296 (47.5 percent) to Reese's 5,498 (41.5 percent) and Hickox's 1,455 (11 percent). Therefore, under Texas law, a runoff election was held on June 3 to nominate a majority winner. Bush then prevailed in the low turnout contest, 6,787 (55.9 percent) to Reese's 5,350 (44.1 percent).Texas Secretary of State, Congressional primary election returns, May 6 and June 3, 1978 In his presidential memoirs, Decision Points (2010), George W. Bush refers to Reese as a \\"smooth-talking former sportscaster and mayor of Odessa ... who felt entitled to the nomination in 1978. He was very unhappy that I had outpolled him in the first round of the primary. Reese had a hard edge, and so did some of his supporters. Their strategy was to paint me as a liberal, out-of-touch carpetbagger. They threw out all kinds of conspiracy theories. Dad was part of a trilateral commission campaign to establish a one-world government. I had been sent by the Rockefeller family to buy up farmland... Despite all of the innuendos, I was optimistic about my chances. My strategy was to build up a bulkhead in my home county of Midland. I lost every county in the district but took Midland by such a huge margin that I won the nomination.\\"George W. Bush, Decision Points (New York: Crown Publishers, 2010), p. 39. Among the donors to Bush in the primary against Reese were the widow of General Douglas MacArthur, former CBS television president Frank Shakespeare, former Ambassador to Great Britain Anne Armstrong,Anne L. Armstrong (1927-2008), a long-term Texas Republican figure from tiny Kenedy County near Corpus Christi, was the first woman to keynote a national party convention, the 1972 GOP conclave in Miami Beach, Florida. and former and future Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld as well as automobile executives from Detroit and oil tycoons from across Texas.Reese, p. 138 It was in this campaign too that Bush first met his political operative and long-term advisor, Karl Rove.John Gizzi, Human Events, January 4, 2005. Reagan political advisor Lyn Nofziger urged the former governor to support Reese because of Reese's political experience and past loyalty to Reagan. Nofziger dispatched Reese a $1,000 check from Reagan's political action committee, Citizens for the Republic.Reese, p. 139 After Reagan donated to the Reese campaign, Texas gubernatorial candidate Bill Clements and his wife, the former Rita Crocker, visited Reagan at the former governor's home in Pacific Palisades, California. Clements was a Bush family friend who had served as assistant defense secretary under Don Rumsfeld in the Ford administration and had been the finance chairman of the elder Bush's unsuccessful 1964 U.S. Senate race against the Democrat Ralph Yarborough. Clements urged Reagan to match the $1,000 contribution that Reagan had rendered to Reese by giving equally to the second Bush. Nofziger claimed to have told Clements: \\"'Mr. Clements, we don't do business that way.' Nothing more was said about it.\\"Reese, p. 139. Reagan and his political team had a rule against making endorsements in contested primaries except for incumbents. Reagan broke his own policy to assist Reese. In the spring of 1978, Reagan came to Abilene, Texas, at the time outside the 19th congressional district, to deliver a speech. Reagan was accompanied by his aide Mike Deaver Reese, p. 139 and Ernest Angelo, Jr., the Republican national committeeman, co-chairman of the 1976 Reagan primary campaign in Texas, but also a Midland friend of the elder Bush. Reese recalls that Deaver and Angelo urged Reagan not to become involved in a contested primary. Nofziger countered by reminding Reagan that he owed nothing politically to the Bushes.Reese, p. 139. This was two years before the formulation of the Reagan‚ÄìBush national ticket. Reese, however, said to Reagan: \\"I told him that I needed his public endorsement.\\" Thereafter while in Amarillo, also outside the 19th congressional district, Reagan filmed a 30-second spot for Reese, with the former governor's hand on Reese's shoulder. Reese added that despite philosophical differences he has attempted to maintain cordial ties with the Bushes over the years.Reese, p. 139. Political writer Kevin P. Phillips, who in 1969 coined the phrase \\"the emerging Republican majority\\" in the title of a book, claims that Reese refused to endorse Bush for the general election. The newcomer was dismissed as \\"too preppy, to Yalie, to be truly Texan.\\"Kevin P. Phillips, American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush (New York: Viking, 2004, ), p. 46 Reese, however, indicates that he voted for George W. Bush every time that Bush's name appeared on a Texas general election ballot. Reese also recalls that he attended a Bush fundraiser in Midland after the runoff election.Reese, p. 140 Bush does not indicate in his memoirs if Reese came aboard for the general election but adds that the Reese challenge \\"toughened me up as a candidate. I learned I could take a hard punch and keep fighting and win.\\"George W. Bush, Decision Points, p. 40 Bush mentions that Reagan called him immediately after the runoff election to offer assistance for the general election, but Bush declined to use either his father or Reagan in the campaign.Reese, p. 140. John Gizzi of Human Events recalls that Reese did support Bush after the runoff primary.John Gizzi, \\"GOP Moderates Often Sore Losers,\\" Human Events, September 28, 2010, Website: http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=39183, [Accessed October 27, 2010]. Reese told Gizzi in 2004: \\"I never saw George [W. Bush] after our primary. He's doing a fine job as President. The endorsement from Reagan in the 1978 primary was, without question, one of the proudest moments of my life. It said a lot about Ronald Reagan.\\"John Gizzi, Human Events, January 4, 2005. Though he had developed a network of friends, particularly from Midland and in the oil industry elsewhere, Bush still lost, 53-47 percent, to the Democratic nominee, State Senator Kent Ronald Hance, who is four years Bush's senior. A native of Dimmitt in Castro County, Hance held the House seat until 1985.Historian Ashley Armes of Wayland Baptist University produced a comprehensive study of the Hance-Bush race but makes no mention of the Reese- Bush primary contests in her article entitled \\"Kent Hance, George W. Bush, and West Texas' 1978 Congressional Election\\" in the West Texas Historical Association Year Book, Vol. 81 (2004) The loss to Hance had been foretold to Bush more than a year earlier by Democratic former Governor Allan Shivers, who informed the young candidate that the 19th Congressional District was tailor- made for a conservative Democrat in the mold of Hance.George W. Bush, Decision Points, pp. 39, 41; Allan Shivers was until Bill Clements completed two nonconsecutive four-year terms the longest-serving governor in Texas history, having held the position from July 1949, to January 1957. Bush said that Hance, with whom he later became friends, continued the Reese strategy against him but was \\"a storyteller\\" and \\"more subtle and more charming\\" than had been Reese.George W. Bush, Decision Points, p. 40. In 1984, Hance ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the retiring John Tower. In 1985, Hance switched parties and in 1986 and again in 1990 sought the Republican gubernatorial nominations, losing, respectively, to Bill Clements, who went on to secure a nonconsecutive second term, and Clayton W. Williams, Jr., the entrepreneur from Midland and Fort Stockton defeated by Ann W. Richards. A lobbyist, Hance has also been since December 1, 2006, the third chancellor of his alma mater, Texas Tech University.\\"Office of the Chancellor: Texas Tech University: Kent Hance\\", Website: ttu.edu., accessed November 11, 2010. 1982 state Senate race Reese and Angelo both ran for office one final time, for state senator in different districts in 1982, the most recent year in which Texas Democrats swept all statewide offices. Angelo filed in District 25, in which W. E. \\"Pete\\" Snelson of Midland retired, and the Democrats nominated Bill Sims as his successor. Angelo had lost to Snelson in 1968 and lost again to Sims in 1982. Reese filed in District 28, which then stretched from Hereford on the north to Odessa on the south but did not include Midland County. Midland and Odessa are now combined in District 31, represented in 2012 by the Republican Kel Seliger, a former mayor of Amarillo, the winner of a special election for the seat in 2004.Senator Kel Seliger : District 31, Website: seliger.senate.state.tx.us., accessed November 11, 2010. The District 28 seatTwo previous District 28 state senators were Lubbock businessman and future Governor Preston Smith, who held the seat from 1957-1963, and Smith's predecessor, Kilmer B. Corbin, a Lamesa and later Lubbock attorney who was the father of the actor Barry Corbin. Kilmer Corbin held the seat from 1947-1957, having been unseated by Preston Smith in the 1956 Democratic primary.

Short, who had served in the Far East with the United States Navy during World War II and had been the District 73 state representative from 1969 to 1979, when he succeeded Kent Hance in the Texas Senate. Short sought a second senatorial term in 1982 but was narrowly unseated in the party primary by John T. Montford, the Lubbock County district attorney. Short won twelve of the fourteen counties in the primary, but Montford's margin in Lubbock County propelled him to the nomination.Reese, p. 141 Reese defeated a primary opponent but nevertheless lost to Montford in the general election. Short, who himself later became a Republican, remained neutral in the Reese-Montford contest. Montford was known at the time by the sobriquet \\"Maximum John\\" because of his aggressive prosecution as district attorney and the lengthy terms that he had sought in the sentencing of convicted criminals.Reese, p. 141 Montford left the state Senate in 1996 to become the chancellor of both Texas Tech and the newly established Texas Tech University System. Thereafter he became a business executive for numerous companies in San Antonio, including American Telephone and Telegraph Company.\\"John T. Montford (born 1942), a Powerhouse at Tech, in Politics,\\" January 11, 2009, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal on-line, January 11, 2009 Accessed October 27, 2010: lubbockonline.com/stories/011109/loc375992637.shtmlMeanwhile, Ernest Angelo ran in District 25, which then reached eastward from Midland to San Antonio. He was defeated by the Democrat William \\"Bill\\" Sims of San Angelo. The seat was vacated by Wallace Eugene \\"Pete\\" Snelson (1923-2014), a decorated World War II veteran from his adopted city of Midland. Snelson was initially nominated in 1968, when he unseated in the Democratic primary the long-term incumbent, Dorsey B. Hardeman of San Angelo. William Sims and his wife, Sue, in 2011 still resided in San Angelo; they lost a 22-year-old grandson to cancer in 2010. Snelson then defeated Ernest Angelo in the 1968 general election, which coincided with the narrow Texas triumph of presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey over Richard M. Nixon and George C. Wallace. In 1982, much of Ector County was outside Senate District 28, which was dominated by the large voting bloc from Lubbock County. \\"I was too hard-headed to accept the fact that Lubbock would control the [state senate] district,\\" conceded Reese, after making his last bid for elective office in the race against Montford.Reese, p. 142 Unlike the Bushes, Reese and Angelo were not originally Republicans. Both attended, unknowing to each other, the 1960 Democratic State Convention in El Paso, presided over by chairman John B. Connally, Jr., who some three years later was inaugurated as the Democratic governor of Texas. Reese and Angelo recall how Connally skillfully cast aside the consideration of committee reports to avoid bringing conservative/liberal divisions within the party to the surface.Reese, p. 142 By 1964, Reese and Angelo were firmly in the Republican camp as delegates to the Texas state Republican convention and enthusiastic supporters of U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona for the presidency against the native Texan Lyndon Johnson, the heir to John F. Kennedy since November 22, 1963. Reese became personally acquainted with Goldwater over the years after the Republican nominee made a campaign stop in Odessa in the fall of 1964,Reese, p. 142 but the two parted company on the Ford-Reagan contest in 1976, as Goldwater endorsed Ford.David Greenberg, Goldwater's Glitter, May 1, 1996, Website: prospect.org, [Accessed November 11, 2010]. Reese developed a friendship with John Tower, another partisan of the Bushes. Reese headed the campaign organization, \\"Young Men for Tower\\" in 1966, when the Republican senator won a second term over the Democratic Attorney General Waggoner CarrWaggoner Carr and his brother, Warlick Carr, were prominent Lubbock attorneys though they were born in Hunt County east of Dallas. Before his death, Warlick Carr contributed to the Republican John Cornyn's reelection bid to the same seat that Waggoner Carr had sought forty- two years earlier against John Tower. Website: http://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/neighbors.php?type=name&lname;=Carr&fname;=W W Carr Campaign Contributions and Donations - Huffington Post [Accessed November 15, 2010] of Lubbock. According to Reese, Tower was \\"shy and a private individual, not a people person, and he irritated people by his bluntness.\\"Reese, p. 143 After the 1966 election, Reese encountered the affable Carr on an elevator, who told him that Carr had lost not because of Tower but through the \\"Reese organization,\\" based on the Jaycees model.Reese, p. 143 Reese recalls the feud between Tower and the 1972 Republican gubernatorial nominee, State Senator Henry Grover of Houston. The story also involves Reese's mentor Rudy Juedeman, a former majority leader of the Montana House of Representatives. While Reese and his wife were on an out-of-town trip in 1971, Juedeman called to urge that Reese return immediately to Texas to discuss the possibility of seeking the 1972 gubernatorial nomination. With several high-profile Democratic candidates splitting the ranks of their own party, the GOP nomination might become an unexpected ticket to the governorship. James E. Lyon, president of River Oaks Bank in Houston,In 1965, James E. Lyon (1927-1993) built the since destroyed USS Flagship Hotel, the first such structure over tidewater. then a Republican state kingmaker of the more conservative faction, held firm for Grover, a former educator, and resisted efforts by those who wanted to entice Reese to run, such as former party chairman Peter O'Donnell of Dallas, an organizer of the Draft Goldwater Committee in 1963.Reese, pp. 143-144 Grover's nomination still required a primary runoff with Albert Bel Fay of Houston, a favorite of the Bushes and the Texas business establishment who had extensive financial holdings in Texas and Louisiana.Fay, Albert Bel (1913-1992), The Handbook of Texas on-line Reese said that he believes that a dispute over the Republican state chairmanship in 1972 split the Grover and Tower partisans to the breaking point and prevented the election of a Republican governor at that time, six years before Bill Clements was narrowly elected in 1978 over John Luke Hill. Tower managed to win a third term, helped in part by the large margin that the national GOP ticket of Richard Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew accumulated over the Democratic partisans of George S. McGovern and Sargent Shriver. Grover, however, lost by almost exactly 100,000 votes to Dolph Briscoe, an Uvalde banker, rancher, and large landholder with close ties to President Johnson.Reese, p. 144Texas gubernatorial general election returns, November 7, 1972; Briscoe received 1,633,493 votes (47.9 percent), Grover, 1,533,986 (45 percent). Briscoe was a \\"minority governor\\" because he failed to garner a simple majority of the votes. The La Raza contender, then 29-year-old Ramsey Mu√±iz, received 214,118 votes (6 percent). Two other minor candidates shared the remaining 27,994 votes, (0.8 percent). With the death of Sargent Shriver (1915-2011), George McGovern became the last living former national candidate from the 1972 general election. McGovern subsequently died in October 2012.

Under the plan, of which there are several variations, all taxpayers would contribute the same percent of tax regardless of income, deductions, credits, exemptions, or other factors involving taxable income. Such a change in the tax code, maintains Reese, would enhance the growth of business, increase employment, and reduce the share of the economy absorbed by government. Reese said that he favors a tax system by which all pay a portion of their income but that no one is excessively or punitively burdened.Reese, p. 146. Reese referred to himself as \\"notorious for political bad timing.\\"Reese, p. 147. He ran for Congress in a nationally Democratic year against an entrenched incumbent in 1976, in a party runoff against a future U.S. president in 1978, and for the state senate in 1982, when Governor Bill Clements was unseated in an especially troubling year for the still fledgling Texas GOP. Had he been a candidate twenty years later, his chances of victory in all three of his legislative races would presumably have been greatly enhanced, considering the political realignment that began in West Texas by the 1990s.Reese, pp. 147, 152. Reese died in 2017 at the age of eighty-seven, a year and a half after the passing of Mrs. Reese.

Mayes disappeared a few days after the mother and daughters disappeared, prompting his name to be added to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives on May 9, 2012, having replaced James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger on the list. On May 10, he and the two girls were spotted in a heavily wooded area outside Alpine; during the capture attempt, Mayes reportedly shot himself in the head and later died from his wounds. The two girls were rescued unharmed. Mayes' wife Teresa was charged with first degree murder and \\"especially aggravated kidnapping\\" (a Tennessee-specific statute) for her part in the murder-kidnapping. Mayes' mother Mary was charged with especially aggravated kidnapping. Both were held in Hardeman County jail. On August 9, 2013, in a plea bargain agreement, Teresa Mayes pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, and was sentenced to 35 years, minus the 460 days she had already spent in prison. Mary Mayes pleaded guilty to two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping and was sentenced to 13 1/2 years. The plea bargain obviated a trial. Background of perpetrators Adam Christopher Mayes (September 2, 1976 ‚Äì May 10, 2012) was the youngest of six children of Johnny and Mary Frances Mayes. He and his wife Teresa lived with his parents in a mobile home in Alpine, Mississippi. Mayes' mother-in-law, Josie Tate, stated that she had repeatedly called police to complain about domestic violence committed by Mayes against his wife, Teresa. She described him as violent and controlling. Mayes' sister described him as aggressive and untrustworthy, but never thought he would commit such a serious crime. For many years, Mayes was friendly with the Bain family of Whiteville, Tennessee. Jo Ann Bain was the mother of three daughters, Adrienne (b. 1997), Alexandria (b. 1999) and Kyliyah (b. 2004). Her first husband, Mark Johnson, the biological father of Adrienne and Alexandria, signed over his legal rights to the girls to Jo Ann's second husband, Gary Bain, in 2011. Gary Bain had previously been married for 20 years to Adam Mayes' eldest sister, Pamela; they divorced in 2002. Mayes was a frequent visitor to the Bain house and had a friendly relationship with the Bain girls. According to his mother-in-law, Mayes likely believed that he was the father of the two younger girls. Murders and kidnapping On April 27, 2012, a day before Mayes was supposed to help the Bain family move to Arizona, Mayes allegedly killed Jo Ann Bain and her oldest daughter Adrienne and kidnapped the two younger girls, Alexandria and Kyliyah. Bain's husband came home late that night and assumed his family members were sleeping; he did not see them the next day. Only when he could not reach his wife by cell phone and his daughters did not return from school did he report them missing. Mayes was interviewed by police officers about the Bains' disappearance on April 29. He told police he was the last to see the mother and daughters, but police found no evidence of a crime. On April 30, Jo Ann Bain's SUV was found abandoned on a country road in Tennessee. Mayes was last seen in Guntown, Mississippi, on May 1; on May 2 he was declared a person of interest in the case, though police still did not suspect a crime. On or around May 4, Teresa Mayes reportedly told police that she had seen her husband kill Jo Ann and Adrienne in the Bains' garage and afterwards she drove him, the bodies and the two younger girls back to Alpine, where he allegedly buried the bodies behind his mobile home. On May 5, investigators uncovered two \\"badly decomposed\\" bodies from a shallow grave behind the mobile home; they were identified as the bodies of Jo Ann and Adrienne on May 7. By May 8, both Mayes' wife Teresa and mother, Mary Frances Mayes, were charged as accomplices and taken into custody. Mayes was added to the FBI's Most Wanted List on May 9. He was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder. Recovery and death Mayes and the two girls were missing for over a week when on May 10, acting on a tip, Mississippi highway patrolmen and state fish and wildlife officers searched a heavily wooded area behind the Zion Hill Baptist Church, one and a half miles from Mayes' home in Alpine. Officers saw one of the children peeking over a ridge, then spotted the second child, then saw Mayes. The officers told him to put his hands up; he raised only one hand and officers saw a gun in the other. Mayes then shot himself in the head with a 9mm pistol. The Union County sheriff said emergency medical technicians transported Mayes via ambulance to Baptist Memorial Hospital, New Albany, Mississippi, in critical condition. The county coroner pronounced Mayes dead at 8:20 pm When police found the trio on May 10, the girls had been in the forest for three days without food or water. They were dehydrated and had rashes from poison ivy and insect bites. After Mayes' death, the girls were sent to a Memphis hospital, treated, and released. Mayes' mother-in-law, Josie Tate, stated that Mayes had taken the \\"coward's way out.\\" Mayes' wife Teresa was charged with murder and kidnapping and faced the death penalty. Tate claims that Adam had coerced and brainwashed the intellectually challenged Teresa into abetting his crimes. Mayes' body, after being left unclaimed and refused by family members, was donated to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville's Body Farm in June 2012. On July 30, 2012, the FBI announced that it had paid out reward money to several individuals for information leading to the capture of Mayes. Legal proceedings On May 21, the charges against Mayes' mother, Mary, were changed from four counts of conspiracy to commit especially aggravated kidnapping to two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping. Investigators believe that she \\"confined\\" the two girls after her son and his wife drove them from their Tennessee home to the Mayes' Mississippi home. The court ordered a psychological evaluation of both Mary and Teresa Mayes and rescheduled their first hearing for June 19. On October 1, 2012, Teresa Mayes appeared in a Hardeman County General Sessions Court hearing while a statement that she had given to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation during her husband's disappearance in May was read to the court. In the statement, Teresa claimed that Adam had planned the kidnappings and murders a year in advance due to his romantic interest in Alexandria Bain, age 12. Adam sold his motorcycle to pay for the kidnapping, and forced Teresa to remain hidden in their car during two aborted attempts to kidnap Alexandria and her younger sister, Kylilah, on April 25 and 26, 2012. On the night of April 26, Adam attempted to kill the girls' father, Gary Bain, by giving him two Tequila Sunrise cocktails laced with Visine and other prescription drugs. After Gary and his wife Jo Ann had gone to sleep, Adam, who had a key to the Bain house, entered the couple's bedroom, woke up Jo Ann, and told her to come out to the shop by the house because Kylilah was sleepwalking. Once in the shop, Adam hit Jo Ann with a board and strangled her with a rope. Afterwards he smothered Adrienne, age 14. He told Teresa to drive around with the two younger girls, Alexandra and Kylilah; afterwards they drove the two girls and the two corpses to Guntown, where Adam buried the bodies in his mother's backyard. Following Teresa Mayes' and Mary Mayes' court appearances on October 1, the judge sent their cases to a grand jury scheduled to convene on January 10, 2013. On August 9, the two women were sentenced in conjunction with a plea bargain that will obviate a trial. Teresa Mayes was sentenced to 35 years and her mother-in-law, Mary Mayes, to 13 1/2 years for their parts in the kidnappings and murders.

Hudaifa entered the province of Oman, but not having strong enough forces to fight Dhu'l-Taj, he decided to wait for reinforcement, and wrote to the Caliph accordingly. The Caliph sent Ikrimah to aid him in late September 632. Ikrimah marched from Yamamah to Oman, and the combined forces of these two generals defeated Dhu'l-Taj at the Battle of Daba, fought in late November 632 at Dibba, a stronghold of Dhu'l-Taj. Dhu'l-Taj was killed in battle. Being appointed governor of Oman, Hudaifa next set about the re- establishment of law and order. Ikrimah, having no local administrative responsibility, used his corps to subdue the neighbourhood of Daba, and in a number of small actions succeeded in breaking the resistance of those of the Azd who had continued to defy the authority of Medina.The Journal of Oman Studies, Page 100ÿå  References  *The information in this article is based on that in its Arabic equivalent.

The story first appeared in Story of My Life by Augustus Hare, written in the 1890s. In 1929, Montague Summers republished the story along with the first chapter of Varney the Vampire. He pointed out that the two stories were very similar and should be dismissed as folklore. Charles G. Harper challenged the Hare book in 1924 after visiting the area. He found no evidence that Croglin Grange ever even existed, but did however find two similar buildings called Croglin High Hall and Croglin Low Hall. Neither fit the description of the place in the book. Eventually, after much research, he came to the conclusion that Croglin Low Hall was the place Hare had referred to in the book, even though a chapel had not existed nearby in many years.Harper, Charles G. Haunted Houses. Detroit: Tower Books, 1971. 288 pp.  Summary  In the particularly dark tale written by Augustus Hare, several episodes took place between 1875 and 1876. An old house had been rented out to a woman and two brothers, Amelia, Edward and Michael Cranswell. During one summer, Amelia was trying to sleep when a strange creature appeared at her window and began picking out the lead surrounding one of the window panes with a long fingernail, then removing it and putting its hand through the resulting gap to undo the window latch and let itself in. It was described as having a brown face and flaming eyes. The vampire bit her in the throat. When her brothers came into the room, the monster was gone. While one brother tried to help his sister, the other went after the creature. After a trip to Switzerland, the three returned to Croglin Grange and the creature returned again. The brother shot it in the leg and was able to track it down to a vault in the local cemetery. They waited until the next day to enter the vault, where they found the body of the vampire, with a fresh wound to the leg, resting inside a coffin. They then burned it.Hare, Augustine.

The main occupations of the locals are fishing and agriculture, so fish, coconuts, cassava, sweet potatoes and a high variety of fruits and vegetables figure into the local cuisine.

Working with another priest, Joaquim Guiu Bonastre, he built up a network of \\"informants\\" - Freemasons who told him about lodge meetings. He contributed articles to the Carlist newspaper El Correo Catal√°n. Tusquets used The Protocols of the Elders of Zion - which drew on French, German and Russian myths in a fantastical concoction that put forward the idea that a secret Jewish government, the Elders of Zion, was plotting the destruction of Christianity - as 'documentary' evidence for his essential thesis that the Jews were set on the destruction of Christian civilization. Their instruments would be Freemasons and Communists who would use revolution, and pornographic propaganda, and unlimited liberalism. In Spain he denounced the Second Republic and accused the Catholic president Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora of being a Communist, a Jew and a Freemason. Spain and the Catholic Church could be saved only through the destruction of Jews, Freemasons and Communists. In his book Origenes he argued that Judaic masonry (la masoneria judaica) ran the Republic as a dictatorship and he further used the many articles he wrote for El Correo Catalan and a series of 14 books las Sectas to attack Freemasonry, Communism and Judaism. The second volume of las Sectas included a complete translation of The Protocols and a section asserting the Jewish assault on Spain could be seen in the Republic's attitude to religion, the movement for agrarian reform and the redistribution of the great estates.Paul Preston, Spanish Holocaust In 1933, Tusquets was invited by the international Anti-masonic Association to visit a newly established concentration camp - Dachau concentration camp. He commented they did it to show what we had to do in Spain. He claimed later to have been shocked by what he saw - 'at the time however the flow and intensity of his anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic publications did not abate.'

Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2010 ; p. 51 Tusquets would come to have influence within the Spanish Right - and specifically over Franco - who enthusiastically devoured his anti- Semitic and anti-Masonic diatribes. Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er, Franco's brother-in- law and right-hand man 1937-41 would later praise Tusquet's contribution to \\"the creation of the atmosphere which led to the national uprising\\". Tusquets was on the periphery of the military plot against the Republic further through his links with Catalan Carlists. When Tusquets finally became a collaborator of Franco in Burgos during the Civil War, his files on alleged Freemasons would provide an important part of the organisational infrastructure of the repression.

It is a rare surviving original bronze statue from Ancient Greece and a rare example in Greek sculpture of a racehorse. Most ancient bronzes were melted down for their raw materials some time after creation, but this one was saved from destruction when it was lost in a shipwreck in antiquity, before being discovered in the twentieth century. It may have been dedicated to the gods by a wealthy person to honour victories in horse races, probably in the single-horse race (Greek: Œ∫Œ≠ŒªŒ∑œÇ). The artist is unknown. Discovery and display The statue was found in a shipwreck off Cape Artemision, in north Euboea, which was discovered in 1926. Also found in the wreck were parts of the Artemision Bronze.\\"Archaelogical Work In Near East\\" in The Times, 5 April 1929, p.13.

Review by Janet Burnett Grossman in Bryn Mawr Classical Review, 2005.02.18. Retrieved 29 May 2013. Archived here. The statue was reassembled, after restoration of the horse's tail and body, and it went on display at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens in 1972. Origins The original artist and the circumstances under which the work was created are unknown. However, Se√°n Hemingway has suggested that it may have been plundered from Corinth in 146 BC by the Roman general Mummius in the Achaean War and given to Attalus but lost while in transit to Pergamon.

Retrieved 29 May 2013. Archived here. It was cast in pieces using an indirect lost wax process and then assembled with flow welding. Some parts are missing, such as the rider's whip and reins, and the horse's bridle. The horse and its rider are rendered realistically, as if captured as the horse springs away in mid-gallop, with its rear feet on the ground and its front legs raised. The bronze of the rear legs is thicker, indicating that they were the statue's primary means of support. The image of the goddess Nike is engraved on the horse's right thigh, holding a wreath in raised hands -- a brand for racehorses in Ancient Greece. The horse dwarfs its jockey, a boy only tall and perhaps 10 years old, possibly from Africa based on his physiognomy and original black patinated surface colouring. His hairstyle, however, is Greek, suggesting a mixed heritage. He rides bareback without a saddle. He wears sandals and a short chiton, and looks back over his left shoulder.

Career =French service= Launched on 26 September 1794 and commissioned two months later under Commander Beaulieu-Leloup, Forte was part of a large frigate squadron under contre-amiral Sercey, also comprising Prudente, R√©g√©n√©r√©e, Vertu, Seine, Cyb√®le and Preneuse. The division sailed to Ile de France to raid commerce in the Indian Ocean. On 15 May 1796 Forte, Vertu, Seine, and R√©g√©n√©r√©e were cruising between St Helena and the Cape of Good Hope hoping to capture British East Indiamen when they encountered the British whaler on her way to Walvis Bay. The French took off her crew, except for two seamen and a boy, and put Fortes fourth officer and 13-man prize crew aboard Lord Hawkesbury with orders to sail to √éle de France. On her way there one of the British seamen, who was at the helm, succeeded in running her aground on the east coast of Africa a little north of the Cape, wrecking her. There were no casualties, but the prize crew became British prisoners. Forte took part in the Action of 8 September 1796, where the frigates drove off two British 74-guns. In 1797, Forte and Prudente were sent to Batavia to ferry troops. Command of Forte was given to Captain Ravenel. Against the wishes of Sercey, General Malartic restored Beaulieu to command.Hennequin (p.210) proved a glimpse of Sercey's reluctance by referring to Beaulieu-Leloup as an \\"inept old man\\". While operating in the Bay of Bengal in early 1799, Forte captured a number of vessels. These were (with their master's name in parentheses): Recovery (M'Kinley), (Johnson). Yarmouth (Beck), Endeavour (Eastwick), Earl Mornington (Cook), and (Moore). Forte also captured two unnamed vessels. She made a cartel of one of her captures and sent her into Madras.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ3087. On 24 February 1799, Forte encountered the East Indiaman . A sharp single-ship action developed, with Osterley losing four men killed and 13 wounded before she struck. Forte spent two days or so transferring some of Osterleys cargo before he let her and her crew proceed. Some accounts state that he released her as a cartel for an exchange of prisoners. Lloyd's List reported that the galley Surprize participated in the engagement but escaped. Battle against HMS Sybille On 1 March 1799, off Bengal, Forte chased and captured two merchantmen. Around 22:00, as Forte sailed to take possession of her prize, a sail was detected leeward, which Beaulieu-Leloup deemed to be another merchantman in spite of the suspicions of his officers. The crew of Forte went to their sleeping quarters, and it took some time to realise that the strange ship was closing in and to call the crew to Battle Stations. When readied, Forte turned about and recognized the ship to be the 38-gun HMS Sybille, under Captain Edward Cooke. At 12:15, Forte opened fire with a few shots, which were left unanswered until she came down the side of Sybille, at which point the British frigate delivered a full broadside, turned about and raked Forte with a second broadside. In the confusion of the battle, the gun crews of Forte were not advised that Sybille had circled around to starboard, and they kept firing their port guns at a ship whose silouhette could be seen through the smoke, but which was actually one of the prizes. After some time, the mistake was realised and the starboard battery was manned; however, as part of the crew of Forte had been dispatched to man her prizes, Forte was too short-handed to man her forecastle guns. At 1:40, a cannonball killed Captain Beaulieu-Leloup and command of Forte passed to Lieutenant Vigoureux. Around the same time, Captain Cooke was mortally wounded on Sybille and relinquished his own command. Vigoureux was killed at 2:00, and Lieutenant Luco took command. By that time, only four guns were still firing. Luco attempted to manoeuver, but the heavily damaged rigging collapsed at 2:25. Sybille inquired whether it was to be understood that Forte had struck her colours, and ceased fire when this was confirmed. =British service= Forte was taken into British service as HMS Forte. She was under the command of Captain Hardyman when she was wrecked on 29 January 1801 off Jeddah, in the Red Sea. She was entering the port with a pilot, William Briggs, when she struck a rock. Briggs knew of the rock, which was visible the whole time, but failed to issue any orders. Hardyman eventually ordered the helmsman to turn, but it was too late. Forte reached the shore and ran up the beach, where she capsized. The court martial board admonished Briggs to be more circumspect in the future and penalized him one year's seniority as a master.Hepper (1994), p. 97. Still, as her ship's company had served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal, which the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants.

It opened in September 1917, and closed with the final repatriation of prisoners in December 1918. It is remembered as the location of the largest PoW escape of the war, in July 1918: 29 officers escaped through a tunnel, of whom ten evaded subsequent recapture and managed to make their way back to Britain. The prisoner-of-war camp is not to be confused with Holzminden internment camp, a much larger pair of camps (one for men, and one for women and children) located on the outskirts of the town, in which civilian internees were held. The internees mainly comprised Polish, Russian, Belgian and French nationals, as well as a small number of Britons. The camp Plan of the camp by H. G. Durnford. South is at the top. The prisoner-of-war camp opened at the beginning of September 1917, under the auspices of X Army Corps, headquartered in Hanover. Other camps for officers under the command of X Corps, all smaller, were those at Clausthal, Str√∂hen and Schwarmstedt. Many of the initial intake of prisoners were transferred from these camps, and others at Freiburg and Krefeld, which had become overcrowded.Hanson 2011, p. 35. The camp held between 500 and 600 officer prisoners.Numbers of officer prisoners were recorded as 560 in the autumn of 1917: Hanson 2011, p. 35. Other rougher estimates were 550 (Durnford 1920, pp. 27, 78); 500 (Crawford 1955, p. 141); and 600 (Hanson 2011, plate opp. p. 229; Cook 2013, pp. 32, 52). About 100 newly captured officers entered the camp following the Spring Offensive of March 1918: Durnford 1920, p. 103. There were also approximately 100‚Äì160 other ranks prisoners, designated orderlies: these men acted as servants to the officers and performed other menial tasks around the camp.Numbers of orderlies were recorded as between 140 and 160 in the autumn of 1917 (Hanson 2011, p. 35); but elsewhere as \\"over 100\\" (Durnford 1920, p. 78); and as 80 (Hanson 2011, plate opp. p. 229). For orderlies' roles, see Hanson 2011, pp. 27‚Äì30. The camp occupied the premises of a cavalry barracks erected in 1913.Hanson 2011, p. 23. The principal buildings, in which the prisoners lived, were two four-storey barrack blocks, known to the Germans as Kaserne A and Kaserne B, and to the British as A House and B House. Although the greater part of both blocks housed officer prisoners, both were partitioned internally: the western end of Kaserne A formed the Kommandantur, in which the German garrison was quartered; while the eastern end of Kaserne B was occupied by the orderlies. The basements included cells in which prisoners could be held in solitary confinement as punishment. Several wooden single-storey buildings in front of the barrack blocks accommodated service facilities, including the cookhouses, woodshed, bath-house, and parcel-room. Regime and camp life Caricature of Hauptmann Karl Niemeyer Cartoon by James Whale of a prisoner in \\"jug\\" (solitary confinement) \\"From early morn to dewy eve\\": cartoon by James Whale of prisoners exercising on the parade ground at Holzminden The camps of X Corps came under the authority of General Karl von H√§nisch, who encouraged a harsh regime. The Kommandant at Holzminden when it opened was the elderly Colonel Habrecht (\\"a kindly old dodderer of about seventy\\"Durnford 1920, p. 18.); but he was replaced after less than a month by his second-in-command, Hauptmann Karl Niemeyer, who remained Kommandant until the camp's closure.Winchester 1971, pp. 191‚Äì8.Hanson 2011, pp. 46‚Äì53. Niemeyer's twin brother, Heinrich, was Kommandant of the camp at Clausthal. The brothers had lived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for 17 years ‚Äì until the spring of 1917, when the United States entered the war ‚Äì and as a result Karl was able to speak English. However, his language was filled with idiomatic errors and slang terms: it was described by one prisoner as \\"bar-tender Yank\\";Durnford 1920, p. 37. while another stated that Niemeyer \\"talked broken American under the impression that it was English\\".Harvey 1920, p. 225. The prisoners constantly ridiculed him, and nicknamed him \\"Milwaukee Bill\\". One error, which became notorious, was his assertion that \\"You think I do not understand the English, but I do. I know damn all about you.\\"Durnford 1920, p. 37. \\"Damn all\\" is a colloquial expression in English meaning \\"absolutely nothing\\". The camp was described by the Daily Sketch in January 1919 as \\"the worst camp in Germany\\".Daily Sketch, 13 Jan. 1919, p. 6; reproduced in Winchester 1971, plate 16. This assessment needs to be understood in context: as a rule, officer prisoners enjoyed a more comfortable regime than other ranks prisoners (see World War I prisoners of war in Germany). Nevertheless, Niemeyer's regime was often arbitrary and punitive, and atrocities were committed, including the bayoneting of prisoners.Hanson 2011, pp. 49‚Äì50. He was put on a British prosecution blacklist for the reported allegations of ill treatment. Two \\"celebrity\\" prisoners who appear to have been singled out for harsh treatment were William Leefe Robinson (who had shot down a German airship over Britain, and who spent much of his time at Holzminden in solitary confinement), and Algernon Bird, the 61st victim of Baron von Richthofen.Hanson 2011, pp. 66‚Äì8. Robinson died in England in December 1918 from the effects of the Spanish flu pandemic, but the Daily Express was in no doubt that he was \\"in reality driven to death by the notorious Niemeyer.... He was murdered by Niemeyer, who was resolved to employ every instrument of cruelty against him\\".; quoted in One deprivation suffered by the prisoners was a poor diet, although again this must be seen in context: as a result of the economic blockade of Germany, little food was available locally even for the civilian population. Prisoners were able to supplement their diet with the contents of parcels sent by their families at home, and by the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations. As a result, they were often better fed than the Germans.Hanson 2011, pp. 71‚Äì90. Prisoners were often able to use items of food to bribe their guards in return for lenient treatment or contraband equipment; while at other times they made a point of taunting their captors with the superiority of their material welfare, for example by drawing their full ration of German black bread only to burn it.Durnford 1920, p. 46.Winchester 1971, pp. 112‚Äì3. Before the prisoners finally left the camp in December 1918, they made a bonfire of the furniture and everything else combustible: \\"it was a splendid sight and the Germans could only stand by helplessly, condemning the waste\\".Crawford 1955, p. 145.Hanson 2011, p. 248.Cook 2013, pp. 226‚Äì7. Cast list for \\"Home John\\", a revue performed in the camp on 27 July 1918. James Whale appeared as \\"Charwoman\\". Prisoners found a variety of ways of dealing with the enforced idleness and monotony of prison life. Activities included sports (football, hockey and tennis were all played), concerts and plays, lectures, debates, and reading.Hanson 2011, pp. 98‚Äì104. Lt James Whale found the amateur theatricals, in which he participated as an actor, writer, producer, and set designer, \\"a source of great pleasure and amusement\\", and the audience reaction \\"intoxicating\\": it was his introduction to stagecraft, and he went on to become a leading Hollywood director.Whale 1919, p. 318.Hanson 2011, p. 102. O. G. S. Crawford spent much of his time reading and studying, and later reported that he was \\"far less unhappy\\" at Holzminden than he had been at his public school, Marlborough College.Crawford 1955, pp. 26, 142‚Äì3. Escapes From the outset, numerous officer prisoners attempted to escape from the camp. Techniques included cutting through the perimeter fence, and walking through the gates disguised as German guards, civilian workers, or (on at least one occasion) a woman.Hanson 2011, pp. 105‚Äì36.Rathborne 2016, pp. 97‚Äì8. Many of these escapes were successful in the first instance, but virtually all escapers were recaptured within a matter of days. The largest and most celebrated escape was that made through a tunnel, on the night of 23/24 July 1918. The tunnel had been under excavation for some nine months. Its entrance was concealed under a staircase in the orderlies' quarters in Kaserne B. As officers were forbidden to enter the orderlies' quarters, in the early months the excavators had to reach it by disguising themselves in orderlies' uniforms. At a later stage, a secret access door between the officers' and orderlies' quarters was created in the attic. Eighty-six officers were on the list of those waiting to escape but, on the night, the tunnel partially collapsed on the thirtieth man, leading to the abandonment of the enterprise. Of the twenty-nine who did escape, ten succeeded in making their way to the neutral Netherlands and eventually back to Britain.Hanson 2011, pp. 191‚Äì239. Among them was Colonel Charles Rathborne, the Senior British Officer in the camp, who ‚Äì on account of his good German ‚Äì was able to travel by rail without arousing suspicion, and managed to cross the Dutch border after only five days.Rathborne 2016, pp. 100‚Äì102. The other escapers travelled on foot, and most took at least 14 days. The camp today Although now surrounded by suburban development, the two main barrack blocks of the camp survive, and are still in military use as barracks for the German Army.Crawford 1955, pp. 146‚Äì7, describes a visit made to the camp in 1953.

A variety of Aswang (Filipino shapeshifter), the Mandurugo resembles a vampire. They are usually young and beautiful women by day, but develop wings and long, sharp tongues by night, which they use to either make cuts in a man's neck, or prick the inside of his mouth while kissing him to obtain blood. The stories, popular to Tagalog and Bicol speakers, have many variations. Sometimes the Mandurugo marries unsuspecting men to prey upon them, or may just select one husband, using him as a cover for her blood drinking activities, flying to other villages to feed.  Legend  \\"The Girl With Many Loves\\" is one popular tale. A young, beautiful woman marries at age sixteen. Her husband, described as an over-weight youth, withers away to bones in less than a year. After he dies, the woman marries again and again with the same result, until she reaches her fourth husband. The fourth husband, fearing the same fate as his predecessors, is afraid to sleep at night and holds a knife in his hand. A little after midnight, the man feels something over him and then a prick on his neck. He stabs at the creature on top of him and hears a loud screech and the flapping of wings. The next day, his wife is found dead not far from the house with a knife wound in her chest. Films In post World War II Philippines, vampirism was a hot topic. The Roman Catholic Church had a major influence on the film industry all over the globe. Films such as The Vampire People (1966) were the product of vampire folklore and mainstream culture. Popular culture * In Marvel Anime: Blade, the Mandurugos are depicted as vampires that can assume a bird-like form.

The organization later changed its name to the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League (Association Canadienne pour le Droit d'Avortement) (CARAL/ACDA).  History  Canadian Abortion Rights Action League was founded on June 20, 1973 in Toronto, by pro-choice activists June Callwood, Kay Macpherson, Lorna Grant, Eleanor Wright Pelrine, Esther Greenglass, and Henry Morgentaler.Canadian Abortion Rights Action League history On November 19, 1974, the group founded the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League in Ottawa. Ed Ratcliffe of London, Ontario was its president. Among the founding members were Norma Scarborough (d. 2 April 2009),Norma Scarborough, founding member of CARAL. (Accessed 2012-07-28.)Norma Scarborough: Tribute to a Pro-Choice Fighter. 2010-04-17. (Accessed 2012-07-28.) and Eleanor Wright Pelrine. A youthful experience affected Ms. Scarborough's attitude towards abortion. When she was a member of the Canadian Women's Army Corps in the 1940s, Ms. Scarborough found a colleague bleeding to death in barracks without medical attention. The woman was afraid to call for help because she had undergone an illegal abortion. Norma arrived too late: the woman bled to death. Her experience gave her a firm conviction that abortion should be legal. The aim of CARAL was to legalize abortion in Canada. To accomplish their aim, they supported Dr. Henry Morgentaler's challenge of the 1969 abortion law, which required the approval of a hospital's Therapeutic Abortion Committee before an abortion could be legally performed (without requiring TACs to be formed or to meet). Fewer than one-third of hospitals had TACs and some TACs existed on paper but never met. In 1980, CARAL changed its name to the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League. In 1982, it separated education and research arm as the \\"Childbirth by Choice Trust.\\" CARAL formed provincial and local chapters across Canada. In July, 1983, it set up the Pro- Choice Defence Fund and helped to raise funds for Morgentaler's legal fees. Their charter is to assure that no woman is denied the right to a safe, legal abortion and to gain recognition that the right to a safe, legal abortion is a fundamental human right. Another reason that they supported Dr. Morgentaler was that the technique he developed, vacuum curettage, was safer and less invasive than the traditional dilation and curettage (D&C;) that was traditionally performed at hospitals for abortions or after miscarriages.LeBolt, Scot A. et al.

The development of non-surgical medical abortion for very early pregnancies has reduced maternal mortality still further. In 1984, CARAL incorporated as a non-profit organization. It was run by a volunteer board of directors and held annual general meetings each spring. The national office stayed in Ottawa. CARAL described itself as the only national pro-choice organization in Canada. In 1991, it had 36 chapters across the country with over 18,000 members. As its aim was to influence legislation, CARAL had no charitable status and relied entirely on private donations. It focused on keeping abortion legal and on improving access to birth control and abortion services. It lobbied federal and provincial legislators; asked governments to fund clinics; and published and spoke about abortion issues. It also supported the local chapters and medical doctors who provide abortion services. In 2003, CARAL published a major study of [www.arcc-cdac.ca/postionpapers/08-Hospital-Access-Problems.PDF access to abortion in Canada]. The study found that only one hospital in six performs abortions and that ready access to abortion is found mainly in large cities and in a narrow strip of more densely populated land near the U.S. border.Hospital access problems, 2003.

Frienisberg Abbey is a former Cistercian religious house in the Swiss municipality of Seedorf in the Canton of Bern. History In 1131 Count Udelhard of Saugern granted his land at Frienisberg to the Cistercian L√ºtzel Abbey. In 1138, the L√ºtzel Abbey sent settlers to Frienisberg to found a new abbey. The new abbey remained small and struggled until the first half of the 13th century, when a number of donations allowed it to expand. In 1233 it owned land in Frienisberg, Allenwil, Ried, Tedlingen, Niederwiler, Werd, G√§serz bei Ins and Montils bei Nugerol. At its peak, about 300 farmers worked 5,000 Juchart (a measurement of acreage related to the Roman Jugerum, 1 Juchart was for a total of ) in 45 villages west of Bern. It also owned vineyards on the shores of Lake Biel and had 282 men working on the vines. Finally it controlled the patronage and the right to appoint parish priests in Rapperswil, Seedorf, Nieder-Lyss, Bargen, Sch√ºpfen and Grossaffoltern. Initially, the majority of the Abbey's income came from rents or produce from its farms and estates. Starting in the middle of the 13th century the economy of the monastery began to slowly change. It moved away from land rents and now began to survive on tithes and offerings. In the second half of the 13th century, the abbey founded the nunneries of Fraubrunnen, Steinen and Tedlingen. In 1386, the Abbey tied itself closely to Bern, when it accepted Bernese citizenship for its monks and farmers. This close connection with Bern led to the Abbey's downfall. When Bern embraced the Protestant Reformation, many Bernese monasteries, including Frienisberg, were secularized. The last abbot, Urs Hirsinger, fled to Hauterive in the Canton of Fribourg rather than remain in Bern. In 1534, the abbey church was demolished. The former convent building was converted into a hospital in 1533 and it housed the local Bernese bailiff until 1798. In 1834 it was converted into a home for the deaf-mute. In 1889 it was converted into a nursing home, a role that it still fills today.

He was the grandson of New York born Indiana pioneer Judge Elisha Mills Huntington. Architectural career Huntington joined the architectural firm of Hoppin & Koen, led by Francis L. V. Hoppin (1867-1941) and Terence A. Koen (1858-1923) after a period with J.P. Morgan & Co. He became a full partner in 1902, and they practiced together until he retired in 1908. The firm was based in Manhattan, New York and is known for police stations, fire stations and dignified town houses in the Beaux Arts Style. Huntington, who was independently wealthy, owned 300 acres on the Hudson River at Staatsburg, New York where he designed and built his residence, Hopeland House, a thirty-five room Tudor Revival mansion(demolished). In addition, he designed his own house in rural Hampton County, South Carolina; his house there at Gravel Hill Plantation, a National Register of Historic Places property, is his only known work south of New York. Tennis career An 1891 graduate from Yale University, Huntington won the singles title at the New England Championship in 1890, and the intercollegiate tennis singles title in 1889. In 1891 and 1892 he won the men's doubles title at the U.S. National Championships together with compatriot Oliver Campbell. In the singles tournament he reached the semifinals in 1890, losing to his doubles partner and eventual champion Oliver Campbell, and again more than a decade later in 1902, losing in four sets to Malcolm Whitman.

For example, a kinetic convex hull data structure maintains the convex hull of a group of n moving points. The development of kinetic data structures was motivated by computational geometry problems involving physical objects in continuous motion, such as collision or visibility detection in robotics, animation or computer graphics. Overview Kinetic data structures are used on systems where there is a set of values that are changing as a function of time, in a known fashion. So the system has some values, and for each value v, it is known that v=f(t). Kinetic data structures allow queries on a system at the current virtual time t, and two additional operations: *\\\\textrm{advance}(t): Advances the system to time t. *\\\\textrm{change}(v,f(t)): Alters the trajectory of value v to f(t), as of the current time. Additional operations may be supported. For example, kinetic data structures are often used with a set of points. In this case, the structure typically allows points to be inserted and deleted. Contrast with traditional data structures A kinetic data structure allows the values stored in it to change continuously with time. In principle, this can be approximated by sampling the position of the points at fixed intervals of time, and deleting and re-inserting each point into a \\"static\\" (traditional) data structure. However, such an approach is vulnerable to oversampling or undersampling, depending on what interval of time is used, and can also be wasteful of computational resources. Certificates approach The following general approach can be used to construct kinetic data structures: # Store a data structure on the system at the current time t. This data structure allows queries on the system at the current virtual time. # Augment the data structure with certificates. Certificates are conditions under which the data structure is accurate. The certificates are all true now, and the data structure will only cease to be accurate when one of the certificates is no longer true. # Compute the failure time of each certificate, the time when it will cease to be true. # Store the certificates in a priority queue, keyed by their failure times # To advance to time t, look at the certificate with the lowest failure time from the priority queue. If the certificate fails before time t, pop it from the queue and fix the data structure so it is accurate at the time of failure, and update the certificates. Repeat this until the certificate with the lowest failure time in the priority queue fails after time t. If the certificate with the lowest failure time in the priority queue fails after time t, then all certificates are true at time t so the data structure can correctly answer queries at time t. =Types of events= Certificate failures are referred to as \\"events\\". An event is considered internal if the property maintained by the kinetic data structure does not change when the event occurs. An event is considered external if the property maintained by the data structure changes when the event occurs. Performance When using the certificates approach, there are four measures of performance. We say a quantity is small if it is a polylogarithmic function of n, or is O(n^\\\\epsilon) for arbitrarily small \\\\epsilon, where n is the number of objects: =Responsiveness= Responsiveness is the worst case amount of time required to fix the data structure and augmenting certificates when a certificate fails. A kinetic data structure is responsive if the worst case amount of time required for an update is small. =Locality= The maximum number of certificates any one value is involved in. For structures involving moving points, this is that maximum number of certificates any one point is involved in. A kinetic data structure is local if the maximum number of certificates any one value is involved with is small. =Compactness= The maximum number of certificates used to augment the data structure at any time. A kinetic data structure is compact if the number of certificates it uses is O(n \\\\operatorname{polylog} n) or O(n^{1+\\\\epsilon}) for arbitrarily small \\\\epsilon. (a small factor more than linear space) =Efficiency= The ratio of the worst case number of events that can occur when the structure is advanced to t=\\\\infty to the worst case number of \\"necessary changes\\" to the data structure. The definition of \\"necessary changes\\" is problem dependent. For example, in the case of a kinetic data structure maintaining the kinetic hull of a set of moving points, the number of necessary changes would be the number of times the kinetic hull changes as time is advanced to t=\\\\infty. A kinetic data structure is said to be efficient if this ratio is small. Types of Trajectories The performance of a certain kinetic data structure may be analyzed for certain types of trajectories. Typically, the following types of trajectories are considered: *Affine:(Linear functions) f(t)=at+b *Bounded- degree algebraic:(Polynomial functions of bounded degree) f(t)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^n a_it^i for some fixed n. *Pseudo-algebraic: Trajectories such that any certificate of interest flips between true and false O(1) times.

She served on the Atlanta City Council and as a member of the Georgia State Assembly, as well as running as a candidate for Mayor of Atlanta. Early life and education Gloria Bromell was born near Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. She is the seventh of eight children born to Beatrice and Charlie Bromell, who were determined that their children would receive the high school education they never had. When she was four, her family moved to her parents' hometown, Plantersville, located in Georgetown County, South Carolina. Bromell graduated from Choppee High School in 1971. She was salutatorian and president of her graduating class. The first in her family to go to college, she attended the University of South Carolina in Columbia for her freshman year as a Herbert Lehman Scholar. She transferred to Howard University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts with honors in 1974. In 1976, Bromell married Soji Tinubu, a Nigerian-born U.S. citizen who has a master's degree in civil engineering from Clemson University. They have four children and two grandchildren. Academia Bromell decided on graduate studies, becoming the first African-American woman to earn an MS in Agricultural Economics (December 1977) from Clemson University. Her master's thesis addressed the problems associated with clouded title property, known as \\"heirs property\\". Her study was the first scientific documentation and measurement of the problem in South Carolina. Her findings were published in Progressive Farmer Magazine (1978), carried by many local newspapers throughout the State, presented at the American Agricultural Economics Association's annual meeting, and submitted to the South Carolina Legislature. The Honorable Herbert Fielding submitted a bill to correct problems identified by Bromell Tinubu. Briefly, freedmen after the American Civil War acquired parcels of property in coastal areas of the state, sometimes passing it on to heirs without much documentation. Parcels became divided with interests split among many heirs. Developers have sometimes persuaded an heir to seek > a buyout of his or her share of the property ... Court action often followed > to allow the individual to realize his or her share. Unfortunately, other > family members were left out in the cold as the land was sold at sheriff's > sales for pennies on the dollar. Through the years, millions of acres of > heirs property have been lost by families that couldn't intervene. In 2006 the state passed its first law to provide more protection to families owning heirs property and who want to keep the family interest in the property. They have been given 10 days to inform courts that they need more time to contact family members and have a chance to buy out the person wanting to sell, and 45 days to raise the purchase price. Commentators believe these time periods need to be lengthened, given the complexity of many cases. Bromell Tinubu continued with graduate work at Clemson, in August 1986 becoming the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in Applied Economics there. Her Ph.D. dissertation studied the financial stability of South Carolina's public water systems. She had started her college academic career as an associate professor of economics in 1986 at Spelman College (Atlanta, Georgia); she became chair of the economics department and earned tenure as full professor in 1992. Since her move to South Carolina, Bromell Tinubu has worked as a teaching associate in the College of Business Administration at Coastal Carolina University in Conway. From 2001 to 2004, she was founder and CEO of Atlanta Cooperative Development Corporation, a community development business for home ownership. Beginning in July 2004, she served as the president of Barber‚ÄìScotia College, a historically black college in North Carolina. Political career Entering politics in Georgia, Bromell Tinubu was elected to the Georgia Board of Education. She was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia General Assembly (HD-60 Georgia General Assembly), where she served on its committees for intra-governmental relations, interstate cooperation, and small business/job creation. Previously she had served as a member of the Atlanta City Council and was a candidate for Atlanta mayor. =2012 Congressional campaign= Having joined the Democratic Party in South Carolina, in 2012 Bromell Tinubu ran for the Democratic nomination in the newly created 7th congressional district Having returned to South Carolina, she entered state politics. In 2012, she ran as a Democrat for Congress in South Carolina's newly established 7th congressional district against state representative Ted Vick and Myrtle Beach attorney Preston Brittain. Vick dropped out of the race prior to the primary. She had won the Democratic primary for the district seat with 73% of the votes. She is the first African- American woman in South Carolina to win her party's nomination for Congress. The South Carolina Election Commission declared Bromell Tinubu as the primary winner, but a judge ruled that the votes cast for Vick had to be counted. That dropped her percentage of the vote total below the 50 percent threshold needed to win the primary. Two weeks later, she beat Brittain in a primary runoff with 73 percent of the vote. Brittain had the endorsement of key Democratic leaders, including U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn and former Gov. Jim Hodges. Bromell Tinubu lost her bid for the US Representative's seat to Republican Tom Rice; he carried 56 percent of the votes to her 44 percent. =2014 Congressional campaign= In 2014 she ran against Rice again. This time she lost by bigger margins than in 2012. Rice won with 60% or 102,576 votes; Bromell Tinubu had 40% and 68,412 votes.Summary of 2014 elections, South Carolina Elections commission, accessed 8 November 2014 References External links * Campaign site Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:American women economists Category:American educators Category:Members of the Georgia House of Representatives Category:Women state legislators in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:African-American state legislators in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:African-American women in politics Category:Howard University alumni Category:Clemson University alumni Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:People from Murrells Inlet, South Carolina Category:Economists from South Carolina Category:21st- century American economists Category:20th-century American economists Category:Candidates in the 2012 United States elections Category:South Carolina Democrats Category:Candidates in the 2014 United States elections Category:Candidates in the 2020 United States elections ","title":"Gloria Bromell Tinubu"},{"id":"35771416","text":"Marie Baum (23 March 1874 ‚Äì 8 August 1964), was a German politician of the German Democratic Party (DDP) and social activist.

Her medical treatise covers many areas of medicine, including gynecology, but not obstetrics. It was widely referenced by other medical writers in ancient Greece and Rome, and was also translated and published in Medieval Europe. Nothing is known of Metrodora's identity beyond her name. However, several women physicians are known to have existed in the ancient Greco-Roman world, and she is generally regarded as the first female medical writer. On the Diseases and Cures of Women On the Diseases and Cures of Women survives in two volumes, containing 63 chapters. Metrodora's approach was heavily influenced by the work of Hippocrates and the Hippocratic Corpus, as were most physicians of her era, for example, she shared Hippocrates' theories concerning hysteria. Metrodora was decisive about controversial topics involving symptomology and etiology; inflammation of the uterus is one example. She made her own unique contributions to advancing medical understanding of theory and etiology. Although female physicians were active in gynecology and obstetrics in ancient Greece and Rome, it was rare that women physicians practiced in other areas of medicine. Childbirth and obstetrics in antiquity were viewed as acceptable areas of medical practice for women who were able to gain medical training as physicians, in large part because of the ancient tradition of midwifery and its association with women trained by other women. Metrodora writes on many areas of medicine in On the Diseases and Cures of Women, including all aspects of gynecology, but obstetrics is not dealt with in the volumes that are extant. Surgery was not typically practiced in ancient Greece or Rome, and is also not covered in her treatise. This is in contrast with the writing of another female physician, Aspasia the Physician, who covered gynecologic surgery including abortion. Aspasia's work was also often referenced by other physician writers, including Aetius and Soranus. Metrodora did not deal with obstetrics, the traditional domain of midwifery, instead focusing on pathology, the same approach being used by male physicians influenced by Hippocrates. She differed from many other male medical writers of her era in analyzing and referring to the writings of Hippocrates directly, rather than using the proliferation of secondary sources in the intervening centuries as the substance of her work. Impact The first Latin translations of On the Diseases and Cures of Women appeared between the 3rd and 5th centuries. The oldest known manuscript of Metrodora's work is located in Florence, Italy. Metrodora's work was referenced by other physician writers, and also republished in extracts. The scholarly texts of ancient Greece and Rome were part of the foundation of Western research during the Middle Ages in Europe. Metrodora's work was circulated during this period as well. Her bibliographic references include \\"a Berenice called Cleopatra\\" or \\"mono marciglia\\", which caused some Medieval publishers to incorrectly attribute her work to the famous Cleopatra VII of Egypt, and it was under the name of \\"Cleopatra\\" that On the Diseases and Cures of Women was published by Caspar Wolf in 1566, and then by Israel Spach in 1597. Metrodora was evidently greatly experienced with clinical practice. Her works reference examinations done both digitally (that is, by hand alone) and using a speculum, and show a detailed familiarity with physiology. She made contributions by formulating classifications of vaginal discharges, and proposed theories on etiology such as the possibility of rectal parasitic infections causing vaginal discharges. Her contributions in these areas appear to have been her original research and theory. There are also many medicine compounds provided in her treatise that have not been found elsewhere. Her work also appears to include the first known alphabetized medical encyclopedia, using alphabetic headings for ease of reference, although it exists in an incomplete manuscript that ends with epsilon.

It was created in 1972 by Alan Kitching, the British animator, graphic designer, and software developer. From 1977 to 1998 the Antics software was continuously developed, and was widely used by many studios around the world.Antics Studios in '80s & '90s (retrieved 2012/04/22) The software of that time ran under Unix and Fortran, which by the late 1990s had been superseded by newer multimedia-oriented systems based on C++, and support for the older Antics was discontinued in 1998. In 2006, a project to build a completely new Antics software for C++ and Windows was begun, and the first published version made available in 2010. Antics in the 2010s In the late 1990s, development of previous Antics versions under Unix and Fortran were discontinued. Some years later, many other animation software programs had appeared, but Kitching determined that very few were comparable to the original Antics principles, and so, in 2006, decided to embark on the project of building a new version of Antics 2-D for Windows. The first aim was to include all the previous functionality within the new Windows interactive design philosophy‚Äîfor this it was named \\"Antics Classic\\". However, by nature, the new design itself totally transformed the older versions to a new level of flexibility and simplicity. This was further enhanced with additional functionality, such as digital video, and then became dubbed the \\"Antics Classic++\\". The first version of \\"Antics Classic++\\" for Windows was launched for free-trial download in 2010, and further updates continued to complete it for the Summer 2011 Edition. Subsequently, Antics continues to be developed, with additional updates issued periodically, taking it to new functionality beyond the original Antics 'Classic' concepts. However, the essential Antics principles have always remained the same, animation = drawings + movements, and are related to traditional animation techniques.Alan Kitching, \\"Computer Animation, Some New Antics\\", British Kinematography Sound and Television journal, December 1973, pp 372-386. An Antics \\"Scene\\" can be made up of any number of \\"Drawings\\", consisting of any number of individual \\"Cels\\". Any mix of vector-based drawings and raster-based images can freely combined in any Cel or Drawing‚Äîincluding photo, scanned, and complete video sequences or other sequences. A wide range of tools is included for creating drawings, and in almost any style. Animation is created with the \\"Animation Chart\\" which choreographs the action using any combination of effects (\\"FX\\") and movements, including \\"Camera FX\\", \\"Graphic FX\\", \\"Inbetween\\", \\"Skeleton\\", \\"Grid\\", \\"Colour FX\\", and many others. Replay rendering can be at any resolution, and output in digital video format or to image files for cinema film recorder. Up-to-date information on the full details and features can be found on Antics Workshop's website. Antics Workshop home page (retrieved 2012/04/22) The Early History of Antics In the early 1970s, Alan Kitching was mainly working on projects using traditional hand-drawn animation techniques, but he also wrote a number of articles for the BKSTS Journal (British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society). One of these included Computer Animation -- Answer or Problem? in which he examined the possibilities offered to animators by emerging computer graphics techniques.Alan Kitching, \\"Computer Animation: Answer or Problem?\\", BKSTS journal, December 1971, pp 436-441. In 1972, Kitching met artist Colin Emmett, who was already experimenting with computer graphics at the Royal College of Art, using computers at Imperial College, London, and the Atlas Computer Laboratory near Oxford.Atlas Computer Laboratory, Chilton: 1961-1975 (Retrieved 2009-06-03) At this point, Kitching had never thought of personally being involved in developing computer software, but when Emmett invited him to join him, Kitching took up the challenge. Before the year was out, he had the basics of a general-purpose animation system, which he named \\"Antics\\", and was completed early the next year. Drawings traced on a computer drawing board came out on punched paper tape, and data for animation effects ('FX') were typed onto punched cards. Both were then fed into the Antics program, which produced the finished results on magnetic tape. Only at this point could the results be viewed, or recorded on 35mm film with the Atlas Lab's film plotter, which was black-and-white only. To achieve color results, Antics produced 3 separate black-and-white films, and used the Technicolor 3-film process to combine them as red, green and blue separations. Hence the name \\"Antics\\" was originally coined as an acronym for \\"ANimated Technicolor-Image Computer System\\". The Antics system was first presented by Kitching at the BKSTS \\"Film 73\\" conference in London, and later again at the National Film Theatre.Alan Kitching, \\"Computer Animation, Some New Antics\\", BKSTS journal, December 1973, pp 372-386. The presentation was then published in the BKST Journal of December 73, and in 1974 was awarded the Society's \\"Denis Wratten\\" award for technical achievement of the year.\\"Computer Animation, Some New Antics\\", BKST journal, December 1973, pp 372-386 - full scanned article (retrieved 2012/04/22) The Antics program was used to produce animation for many clients, including Finite Elements, a documentary made for the Atlas Lab itself in 1975.Atlas Computer Laboratory - Finite Elements (retrieved 2012/04/22) In 1977, the national broadcaster Swedish TV (Sveriges Radio - 'SR') invited Kitching to develop a hands-on interactive version of Antics in Stockholm that would allow it to be used by even complete beginners without technical knowledge. This set-up used only a single monochrome screen and a drawing tablet, filmed direct off screen, and then variously coloured in the film processing.\\"Not only computing -- also art\\", John Lansdown, Computer Bulletin, March 1980 (retrieved 4 September 2012)\\"Antics - Graphic Animation By Computer\\", by Alan Kitching, Computers & Graphics, 1979, vol 2, pp 219-223, describes Antics as being implemented in Swedish TV. The project ran to 1979, culminating in production of a 5-minute cartoon short The Story of G, from a storyboard written by a group at the local art school. Antics full-colour results were later recorded using an experimental colour frame-store called BugStore, at the CADCentre in Cambridge.\\"Antics Animation at Swedish Television\\", by Alan Kitching, Television journal of the Royal Television Society, March/April 1979, pp 11-14, article describing the interactive version of Antics developed at Swedish TV. Antics Through the 1980s and the 1990s The Swedish Antics system was detailed in a major article by Kitching for the BKSTS Journal of August 1980, Antics -- From Stone-Age to Steam Age, which also described Kitching's vision for the future development of Antics towards full real-time interactivity.\\"Antics - From Stone-Age to Steam Age\\", by Alan Kitching, BKSTS Journal magazine, August 1980, pp 394-404. In 1980, Japanese computer maker Nippon Univac Kaisha (NUK) set up a new Antics project with Kitching which ran between 1980 and 1982. This was the first machine suitable to run Antics as a dedicated stand-alone system, and included interactive full-colour and broadcast VTR recording. This became the first fully commercial configuration, and over a dozen systems were sold in Japan alone.\\"Antics in Nippon Animation\\", by Alex Pousselle, Byte magazine, October 1983, pp 378-381.\\"About The Cover\\", IEEE Computer Graphics magazine, March 1985, lead article on Antics, cover & pp 6-7.\\"Animators' Tool\\", IEEE Computer Graphics magazine, December 1985, article on Antics by Margaret Neal, pp 5-7. In 1985, suitable hardware was still very costly, but subsequent years saw prices gradually coming down as performance also steadily improved. From the DEC platforms of 1980 (Digital Equipment Corporation), then to Silicon Graphics in 1984, and then Apple Macintosh in 1989, Antics software supported all these platforms, and many new Antics studios sprang up in Europe, USA, and beyond. Then, after the early '90s, Microsoft's Windows PC platform was starting to reach the performance needed for Antics, but with much lower hardware costs‚Äîand additionally it was also incorporating the kind of output and video devices required as standard, in particular for the emerging market of PC multimedia production. To date, Antics software had all been implemented using the 'Fortran' language, and current platforms used the 'Unix' operating system. New integrated hardware, such as PC and Mac, required a new software design approach (\\"Event Driven\\"), which allowed relevant devices, like mouse and keyboard, to trigger input at any time‚Äîwhich made it much more natural for graphical use. The previous Antics approach was not compatible with this new design philosophy, and the Autumn 98 Edition was the last Unix/Fortran edition to be supported, as older platforms gradually became obsolete. At this point, further development of Antics was discontinued, since the only option would be to write the entire software from scratch, using the 'C++' language‚Äîa task which might take several years‚Äîand which was not begun until 2006.

The church's austere lines is a morphological hybridization of the styles employed during the reign of Queen Maria I. In the widespread typology of regional architecture, the Baroque elements are evident in the lintels and trim curves, framed in a composition that is, generally, more rigid then in the gable design. History Around the end of the 18th century, the church was constructed within the remodelling of the Largo Marqu√™s de Pombal by Joaquim Guilherme d'Oliveira. Architecture The church is a rare example, important for the group details and composition, including pinnacles and triumphal arch, different from the vernacular characteristics of other temples of the same size in the region. The church is located in the centre of a large square (Largo Marqu√™s de Pombal), aligned with trees and a central garden. It has a longitudinal plan, formed of a nave and a narrower presbytery, with lateral sacristy and tiled articulated spaces. The principal facade is oriented towards the north, defined by accented corners, a finial gable crowned by a cross (resting on a plinth in masonry) and stone urns on plinths crowning the corners. The church portal is an arched frame, surmounted by a big window with ornate semi-circular frame. The lateral facades are simple with no doorways or windows. =Interior= The unique nave is covered in wood with three plans, with a lower footer in blue and white azulejo tile. Within this space, framed by the same portal and window, to the right, is a basin for holy water, while a triumphal arch framed in stonework, with pilasters and single step. The presbytery is covered with vaulted-ceiling, with cornice, while the main altar is preceded by two steps and framed within a gilded retable. A central rounded niche is flanked by pilasters with volutes and upper architecture in multiple lobes, framed by a medallion with the monogram AM circled by glint and urns. On either side are corbels and false niches gilded and painted. On the left wall is a doorway to the sacristy. The church is constructed of stone masonry and mortar primarily, plastered and whitewashed, with the portal and secondary elements in stone. In addition, the elements of the church include tile covering of straw, wood-lined ceilings with dome plastered and whitewashed, tiled floors, wooden window frames, gilded altarpiece and polychromatic tiles.

Some years after his purported journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific, Moncacht-Ap√© related his adventures and itinerary to Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, a French explorer and ethnographer in the colony of Louisiana. Le Page published his memoir in the 1750s, including material from Moncacht-Ap√©'s account. He said that native people on the West Coast had told him of their ancients coming to North America by a land bridge. A partial English translation of Le Page's book was published in 1763. As it included material about the peoples and the geography of greater Louisiana, it was taken as a guide by later European and American pioneers, including Lewis and Clark, during the continuing exploration of North America. Some historians have disputed the fact of Moncacht-Ap√©'s transcontinental journey. Le Page's is the only first-hand account of Moncacht-Ap√©'s story, and its veracity is difficult to confirm. Le Page's account In 1718, Le Page left France as part of an expedition of 800 men on three ships, arriving in the Louisiana colony later that year. There he learned the language of the Natchez, a local tribe in the area of the Mississippi River and the Natchez Bluffs. He befriended native leaders. For most of his time in La Louisiane, where he remained until 1734, Le Page lived at a trading post at Natchez, Mississippi, explored the local territory, and observed its native peoples. More than fifteen years after his return to France, he published a memoir of his time in America as Histoire de la Louisiane.Gordon M. Sayre, \\"Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz: A Biographical Outline\\", University of Oregon, accessed 3 May 2009 In his memoir, published in Paris in installments beginning in 1753, Le Page describes his attempts to uncover the history of tribes in Louisiana that, unlike the Natchez, believed that they came from far away in the northwest. Le Page inquired among the tribes for \\"some wise old man who could enlighten me further on this point.\\" He was introduced to Moncacht-Ap√©, a member of the neighboring Yazoo tribe.\\"History of Louisiana\\", Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, trans. Stanley Clisbey Arthur, 1775, accessed 5 May 2012 Le Page writes that Moncacht-Ap√©, whose name means \\"the killer of pain and fatigue\\" in his native language, was called \\"the Interpreter\\" by the French, owing to his extensive knowledge of native languages. Le Page's description of Moncacht-Ap√© as elderly at the time of their rendezvous, which almost certainly occurred before the outbreak of the Natchez War in 1729, suggests that Moncacht-Ap√©'s journey across the continent would have taken place many years before, likely during the second half of the seventeenth century. Moncacht-Ap√©'s travels would have pre-dated the transcontinental Lewis and Clark Expedition, as well as Alexander Mackenzie's 1793 overland crossing of what is now western Canada, by more than a century. Itinerary In Le Page's telling, Moncacht-Ap√© set out alone after the death of his family in search of the origins of his people. He first traveled northward from his native Mississippi, up the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and eventually past Niagara Falls to the coast of the North Atlantic. From there, he retraced his steps to the Mississippi, then turned north and reached the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, near present- day St. Louis. He followed the Missouri River to its headwaters, in what is now Montana, before crossing the Great Divide and continuing his journey westward on a waterway he says local tribes called \\"The Beautiful River\\". That river, probably a tributary of the Columbia, took him into the Pacific Northwest and eventually to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. Influence on later explorers Later European and American explorers learned of Moncacht- Ap√©'s travel through Le Page's book. In it, Le Page published a map based on Moncacht-Ap√©'s itinerary; it became well known and was compared by Denis Diderot in his Encyclop√©die to charts prepared by other explorers. Lewis and Clark carried an English translation of Le Page's Historique on their expedition across the Louisiana Purchase. Moncacht-Ap√©'s failure to mention crossing the Rocky Mountains may have inspired their over-optimistic belief that they could easily carry a boat from the headwaters of the Missouri to the westward-flowing Columbia River.\\"A Native American Scoops Lewis and Clark\\" , Gordon M. Sayre, Common-Place: The Interactive Journal of Early American Life, Vol. 5, No. 4, July 2005, accessed 5 May 2012 Veracity of Le Page's account A second account of Moncacht-Ap√©'s transcontinental journey was given by Jean-Fran√ßois-Benjamin Dumont de Montigny, a French army officer, in Chapter 41 of his Memoirs historiques sur la Louisiane (wherein the Indian's name is given as \\"Moncachtab√©\\"). Dumont published his work in 1753, just before the first installment of Le Page's Historique. But Dumont, who was acquainted with Le Page in Louisiana, attributes his story to Le Page, so both of their accounts of the exploits of Moncacht-Ap√© rest on the same story reported by Le Page. Dumont claimed to have known Moncacht-Ap√©, so many historians accept that there was such a historical person. But they find it difficult to ascertain the quality of his account. Some historians speculate that Le Page embellished Moncacht-Ap√©'s journey with details supplied by fur traders and Indians who had traveled into the interior of the continent, then mostly unknown to Europeans. Others argue that Le Page's account is lent credence by its rejection of claims of inaccurate contemporary geography, such as the purported \\"Sea of the West\\".Davis, Andrew Mcfarland \\"The Journey of Moncacht-Ap√©\\", Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society 2(3): p.345; [321-348] 1883 Representation in other media *Jonathan Reynolds Cronin (Hoksila Tanka in Nakota) wrote a historical novel based on Moncacht-Ap√©, titled Yazoo Mingo: The Journeys of Moncacht-Ape Across North America 1687-1700 (2002).

He has defended some of the most notorious criminals in Canadian history, including Paul Bernardo, Pat and Angelo Musitano, Min Chen, Paul Volpe, Johnny Papalia, Carmen Barillaro and Pietro Scarcella. He is a partner in the Toronto law firm of Rosen Naster LLP.  Early life  John Rosen's grandparents immigrated to Toronto from Poland in the early 1900s. He is the eldest of six children, whom his father supported with his Bay Street dry-cleaning shop, Imperial Cleaners, across from the Toronto Coach Terminal. At age 16, Rosen began driving the dry-cleaning delivery truck after school. Professional career John Rosen received his LL.B. from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1968. He was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1970. He is a member of a number of professional associations, including the Advocates Society, the Criminal Lawyers' Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers in the US, and Canadian and American Bar Associations. Rosen is well known for the notoriety of the accused criminals he defends. He is also known for the ruthlessness of his defence of persons accused of odious crimes. In one case, he was criticized for making a murder victim seem like a criminal. Rosen successfully defended a man charged with second degree murder, where the prosecution withdrew the charge on the eve of trial following John's appearance in the Supreme Court of Canada in the related case of Benson v. Brown, which set the ground rules for allowing access to lawyer/client confidential information regarding another suspect previously cleared by the police.  High-Profile Cases  Among Rosen's high-profile cases were: * Paul Bernardo, infamous Canadian serial killer and rapist. * Defence of Pietro Scarcella, charged in the 2004 shooting of a Vaughan sandwich shop that left Louise Russo paralyzed. * Min Chen, a Chinese visa student at the time, was found guilt of the kidnapping and murder of nine year-old Cecilia Zhang. * Defence of Chuang Li, an ex-employee charged with stabbing 4 former co- workers.

They were created by the Royal Greenland Trading Department (KGH). 1840 Commission In 1840, a government commission investigating the Greenland trade issued a report proposing that the KGH be operated on a non-profit basis, re√Ønvesting any surplus towards benefiting the native Greenlanders; this was accepted, although the company reserved the right to interest on the government's investment into Greenland.S√∏rensen, Axel Kjaer. \\"Denmark-Greenland in the Twentieth Century\\". Meddelelser om Gr√∏nland [Monographs on Greenland]: Man and Society, No. 34. The Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland (Copenhagen), 2006. The prices paid for native goods principally sealskins and whale blubber were raised and expenditures on education (two teacher training colleges and scholarships for study in Denmark) and health care (an additional doctor) increased. Parsissaet established The parsissaet, headed by the local Lutheran priest and KGH factor and composed of appointed Greenlanders, were established experimentally in 1857 and permanently in 1861. The councils were granted control of one-fifth of the area's profits and in exchange took over poor relief, which had previously been the responsibility of the KGH. Profits left unspent by the parsissaet were divided among the local Inuit hunters on the basis of their catch. Jurisdiction The parsissaet also had jurisdiction over local civil suits and misdemeanors among Greenlanders, although felonies were simply investigated and left for the royal governor to decide. The only written laws were that the following actions were illegal: > 1\\\\. Unauthorized use of property belonging to others, such as using their > tools without permission; damaging such tools; keeping other hunters' > catches without payment; taking possession of driftwood which another person > had already dragged above the high water mark; > 2\\\\.

The √éle Bonaparte and √éle de France constituted French outposts in the Indian Ocean, from which privateers and frigate squadrons could engage in commerce raiding and disrupt British shipping. After encountering a strongly escorted British convoy, the 40-gun Cannoni√®re attempted to flee, but was rejoined by the 74-gun . In the ensuing battle, Captain Bourayne displayed superior sailmanship and managed to fend off his much stronger opponent by a combination of manoeuvers that rendered the batteries of Tremendous ineffective, and threatened her with sustaining raking fire. The French frigate thus managed to evade and escape. Background In 1806, a French squadron under admiral Linois operated the Indian Ocean. In addition to the usual frigates and corvettes, in this case the , , and Aventurier, the flaghip of the squadron was a 74-gun ship of the line, the Marengo. On 14 November 1805, the 40-gun Canonni√®re sailed from Cherbourg under Captain C√©sar-Joseph Bourayne in order to reinforce and resupply Linois's squadron. She arrived at Ile de France in April, but failed to find Linois's forces; unbeknownst to Bourayne, the squadron had been destroyed in the Action of 13 March 1806. Hoping to join Linois, Canonni√®re sailed to patrol the Indian Ocean. Battle On 20 April, as she cruised off Natal, Canonni√®re spotted an 11-Indiamen convoy, escorted by the 74-gun HMS Tremendous, under Captain John Osborn, and the 50-gun HMS Hindostan, under Captain Alexander Fraser. Tremendous gave chase, and Canonni√®re attempted to flee the much stronger opponent. The light wind favoured the frigate, which would have escaped had she not been forced to adjust her course to avoid the land. The wind then strengthened, favouring Tremendous. At 15:30, Canonni√®re and Tremendous began exchanging fire from their chase guns. After a 7-hour chase, Tremendous had closed in enough to make the battle inevitable, and Canonni√®re turned hard to starboard and opened fire, Tremendous responding in kind. However, Canonni√®re had the initiative and had prepared her rigging before the manoeuver, while Tremendous had had to imitate the frigate in haste and was still sailing full sail, including her studding sails. This induced a pronounced listing on Tremendous, hindering the efficiency of her artillery. The British had to adjust their sails in haste, which gave an advantage to Canonni√®re. At 17:15, the rigging of Tremendous had suffered from the fire of the frigate, and she was in danger of losing her mizen. Osborn then attempted the rake Canonni√®re, but the frigate outmanoeuvred the 74-gun and took the position which would put the bow of Tremendous in her broadside at the end of her evolution, which Osborn thus cancelled. At 17:35, the two ships were sailing on almost parallel courses, but increasing distance. The Indiaman Charlton fired a broadside at Canonni√®re in passing, from a long distance, but her fire was ineffective and she did not press her attack.James, W. \\"Naval History of Great Britain\\" vol IV. London Baldwin, Cradock & Joy, 1824, p. 234-236 The frigate and the British eventually broke contact. Aftermath In spite of the overwhelming superiority of her opponents, Canonni√®re had managed to escape with light damage, and Captain Bourayne wounded, but not seriously. The British historian William James praised Bourayne for his sober and accurate account of the engagement: \\"No rodomontade; all is plainly, yet minutely told, and, in every material point, agrees with the entry in the British ship's log\\";Naval history of Great Britain, by William James, vol. IV, p.235 he furthermore cites the action as a textbook example of defence against a stronger opponent: Canonni√®re was very nearly captured on 29 April, however, when she sailed into the harbour of Simon's Town, ignorant of the fact that the Dutch colony had been captured by the British. A boat of the frigate was sent ashore with ensign Larouvraye, and as soon as it reach the ground, the Dutch flags on the buildings were replaced by the Union Jack, and the forts opened fire on Canonni√®re, which narrowly escaped without being seriously hit. Bourayne then return to Reunion, and from there cruised to the Philippines. He would continue to operate in the Indian Ocean and undertake commerce raiding.

It is designed to store elements (keys associated with priorities) where the priority is changing as a continuous function of time. As a type of kinetic priority queue, it maintains the maximum priority element stored in it. The kinetic heap data structure works by storing the elements as a tree that satisfies the following heap property if is a child node of , then the priority of the element in must be higher than the priority of the element in . This heap property is enforced using certificates along every edge so, like other kinetic data structures, a kinetic heap also contains a priority queue (the event queue) to maintain certificate failure times.  Implementation and operations  A regular heap can be kinetized by augmenting with a certificate [] for every pair of nodes, such that is a child node of . If the value stored at a node is a function of time, then this certificate is only valid while . Thus, the failure of this certificate must be scheduled in the event queue at a time such that . All certificate failures are scheduled on the \\"event queue\\", which is assumed to be an efficient priority queue whose operations take time. = Dealing with certificate failures = right When a certificate [] fails, the data structure must swap and in the heap, and update the certificates that each of them was present in. For example, if B (call its child nodes Y,Z) was a child node of A (call its child nodesB,C and its parent node X), and the certificate [] fails, then the data structure must swapB and A, then replace the old certificates (and the corresponding scheduled events) [], [], [], [], [] with new certificates [], [], [], [] and []. Thus, assuming non-degeneracy of the events (no two events happen at the same time), only a constant number of events need to be de-scheduled and re-scheduled even in the worst case. = Operations = A kinetic heap supports the following operations: * : create an empty kinetic heap * (or find-min): return the (or for a ) value stored in the heap at the current virtual time . * : insert a key into the kinetic heap at the current virtual time , whose value changes as a continuous function of time . The insertion is done as in a normal heap in time, but certificates might need to be changed as a result, so the total time for rescheduling certificate failures is * delete a key at the current virtual time . The deletion is done as in a normal heap in time, but certificates might need to be changed as a result, so the total time for rescheduling certificate failures is .  Performance  Kinetic heaps perform well according to the four metrics (responsiveness, locality, compactness and efficiency) of kinetic data structure quality defined by Basch et al. The analysis of the first three qualities is straightforward: * Responsiveness: A kinetic heap is responsive, since each certificate failure causes the concerned keys to be swapped and leads to only few certificates being replaced in the worst case. * Locality: Each node is present in one certificate each along with its parent node and two child nodes (if present), meaning that each node can be involved in a total of three scheduled events in the worst case, thus kinetic heaps are local. * Compactness: Each edge in the heap corresponds to exactly one scheduled event, therefore the number of scheduled events is exactly where is the number of nodes in the kinetic heap. Thus, kinetic heaps are compact. = Analysis of efficiency = The efficiency of a kinetic heap in the general case is largely unknown. However, in the special case of affine motion of the priorities, kinetic heaps are known to be very efficient.  Affine motion, no insertions or deletions  In this special case, the maximum number of events processed by a kinetic heap can be shown to be exactly the number of edges in the transitive closure of the tree structure of the heap, which is for a tree of height .  Affine motion, with insertions and deletions  If insertions and deletions are made on a kinetic heap that starts empty, the maximum number of events processed is O(n \\\\sqrt{n\\\\log n}). However, this bound is not believed to be tight, and the only known lower bound is \\\\Omega(n\\\\log n).

It is part of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, which contains about 321 genera and 7,950 species. The family derives its name from Euphorbus who was a Trojan War hero in Greek mythology, and was also the Greek Physician of King Juba of Numidia. The genus, Croton, is derived from Greek, meaning \\"tick,\\" and this is because the seeds of the plant resemble a tick. The species, glandulosus gets its name from the gland like structures that appear at the end of the leaf stalk. Vente conmigo and various others species are found to be common weeds in gardens and lawns. Distribution Croton glandulosusis a weedy herb which can be found all throughout southeastern United States, Central America, and in some parts of South America. It is native to the U.S. and mostly prevalent in the coastal plain and piedmont in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. It has even spread to regions as far north as Indiana and Iowa. Since this is an herbaceous weed, it is becoming problematic for many agronomic crops such as corn, soybeans, cotton, and many others in southeast Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia. Habitat and common characteristics Tropic croton can be typically found in dry or sandy soil, fields, pastures, river terraces, cultivated fields, waste grounds, and along roadsides and railroads. A common characteristic of Croton glandulosus is that it is a summer annual plant. Therefore, it dies completely at the end of each growing season and grows back from a new seed. It is commonly known to have stellate hairs, it is glandular, and it typically ranges anywhere from 4 to 24 inches in height. It is also monoecious, which basically refers to a single plant that has both female and male reproductive organs on it. It is typically dark green with serrated leaves and has white disc-like glands that appear above and below the petiole where the stem and petiole meet. Tropic croton can be typically mixed up with the Eclipta prostrate plant because of its similar plant structure but in reality the leaves of the Eclipta prostrate are more linear and arranged oppositely, whereas the leaves on the tropic croton are arranged alternately. The tropic croton can also be confused with Sida spinosa in terms of its growth patterns and appearance but it is important to understand that the Sida spinosa lacks the disc-like glands that appear above and below the petiole. Also the Sida spinosa lacks stellate pubescent which are characteristic of tropic crotons. Morphology C. glandulosus The root of the Croton glandulosus can be characterized by a pungently fragrant tap root. The stem of the plant has stellate trichomes or hairs, small glands and stomata on it. The stem is slender, corymbosely branched or nearly simple and erects from a tap root. The leaves are alternate, and when they are young, they are oval-shaped but as they mature they become more lance-shaped and elliptical. The edges of the leaves are serrated or toothed which makes this species easy to identify. The leaves are located on small petioles and have a white, oval-like gland on either side of the petiole as the petiole meets the stem. The leaves of the plant are whorled and they occur below the flowers. The greater and lesser surface of the leaf has small stellate hairs and when the leaf is crushed it gives off a unique odor. Typically, the flowering season for the tropic croton is from July to October. It has white terminal flowers which are 4 or 5 parted and they occur at the ends of stems. Females tend to have 4 sepals with 4 petals while males only have 5 sepals and no petals. It has elongated inflorescences known as racemes. The plant fruits from August to October and the fruit has a brown capsule of three chambers which has three seeds that are shiny, grayish-tan, stippled with black, and oval-shaped. In terms of the seedling, it stems underneath the cotyledons which are mostly cased with hairs that give off a star-shaped look. The cotyledons tend to be 5 to 7 mm long by 7 to 10 mm wide, dense, heart-shaped, and have three distinguishing veins that come from the same place, also known as palmate venation. Additionally, the first true leaves that emerged are toothed and egg-shaped. Weed species The increasing prevalence of tropic croton in southeast America has had a negative effect on the growth of many vital crops. Although limited research has been conducted to study the competitiveness of tropic croton, multiple studies have shown the troublesome nature of this herbaceous weed. Research illustrated that tropic croton is the third most bothersome weed in peanuts and fifth most bothersome weed in cotton. Possible reasons for its increasing prevalence and competitiveness are its ability to effectively release multiple mature seeds which are quickly consumed by birds and thus are easily dispersed. Also, multiple herbicides that are used in cotton and peanuts are less effective on tropic croton which further increases its occurrence.http://www.caes.uga.edu/applications/publications/files/pdf/C%20865_3.PDF References glandulosus Category:Plants described in 1759 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Croton glandulosus"},{"id":"35772204","title":"2012 Northeast Conference Baseball Tournament"},{"id":"35772208","text":"Niue is an island in the Southern Pacific, mostly inhabited by Polynesians.

The most significant ingredient when discussing the Niue's recipes are the fish and the vegetables. The staple ingredient is fish. Fish is consumed roasted, grilled, raw, and in soups or stews. There is a wide spectrum of edible and enjoyable fish species: tuna (ahi), dolphinfish (mahi mahi), parrot fish (pakati), barracuda (ono), coconut crabs and crayfish. In less populated areas, people prefer to eat vegetable meals, like taro roots or manioc. Nane Pia is one of the few food specialties of the island. It is a translucent porridge made from arrowroot and coconut, and has a thick slimy texture. The taste can be described as somewhat bland with a hint of coconut.

A big umu (earth oven) is set for the tourists, who can try the delicacies from all of Niue's cuisines. In the central town, Alofi, local markets take place two times every week. All the local fruits, vegetables, fish and seafood can be found there. Among the most popular items from the market are uga, taro, yams, cassava and breadfruit.

In Alofi, Polynesian and European food can be found in the restaurants, besides the traditional Niue ones. In the villages, people usually consume only the local plants and fish; the food is mostly homemade, using the earth ovens. Preparation methods for Niuean cooking The visual attractiveness of the dish is important, and a balance between colours and proportion differentiates. Each traditional dish has a special cooking method, which is more or less general in all of Niue's regions. Meat is one of the main elements of most Niue dishes, and cured and smoked hams are often included. Niue cuisine uses elements from cooking traditions borrowed from their neighbours and developed from their own traditional dishes.

The belief is first attested in the medical texts of ancient Greece, but it persisted in European academic medicine and popular thought for centuries. The wandering womb as a concept was popularized by doctor Edward Jorden, who published The Suffocation of the Mother in 1603. Suffocation of the Mother was the first text on the subjects of the wandering womb and hysteria that was written in English. Origins The belief in the \\"wandering womb\\" was found in ancient Greece. Some scholars have argued that it originated in Egypt, but this has now been disproved. One description of the theory of a \\"wandering womb\\" comes from Aretaeus, a physician from Cappadocia, who was a contemporary of Galen in the 2nd century AD. He wrote that the uterus could move out of place, and float within the body. In the translation of Francis Adams (1856) this reads: The Greek translated here as \\"like an animal within an animal\\" would be better translated as \\"like a living thing inside another living thing\\". The belief that the uterus could move freely, which this imagery evokes, was linked to the use of scent therapy to entice it up or down within the body. This may have been part of ancient cultural beliefs in Greece, but the earliest known written accounts of it are in the fifth- and fourth-century BC texts associated with the name of Hippocrates. The movement of the uterus was believed to cause symptoms throughout the body, depending on the destination to which the uterus moved in search of fluid. Opposing views Soranus of Ephesus, another second century AD physician, opposed the theory of the \\"wandering womb\\". In a description of what he labelled \\"hysterical suffocation\\" - suffocation arising in the uterus - Soranus wrote, \\"the uterus does not issue forth like a wild animal from the lair, delighted by fragrant odors and fleeing bad odors, rather it is drawn together because of stricture caused by inflammation\\". Where Aretaeus used the more neutral \\"living thing\\", Soranus used the term for \\"wild beast\\", therion. Galen also insisted that the uterus was stationary and that symptoms were due to substances being retained inside it. This suggests that Aretaeus was unusual among physicians of his period in believing in a mobile and animate womb. Despite the fact that Soranus was an influential writer on gynecology, and that Galen was the Greco-Roman medical writer with the greatest overall influence on Medieval and Renaissance medicine in Europe, the belief in the \\"wandering womb\\" continued for centuries, for example in Edward Jorden's influential 1603 treatise on the supposed bewitching of 14 year-old Mary Glover. Hysteria The idea of a condition called hysteria caused by \\"wandering womb\\" developed from the \\"hysterical suffocation\\" of ancient Greek writers. Medical researchers developed a better understanding of anatomy after the invention of microscopes in the 17th century and cellular research in the 19th century. Sigmund Freud's theory of the free-floating unconscious, the \\"mind within the mind\\", was similar to the ancient belief in the \\"animal within the animal\\". Edward Jorden, author of The Suffocation of the Mother, used hysteria as an explanation for mysterious medical occurrences in young women. He supposed that the hysteria caused by the \\"wandering\\" of the womb around the body was the source of witchcraft, and often presided in witchcraft-related trials as an expert on the subject. The Suffocation of the Mother connected the phenomenon of hysteria with actions like singing, laughing, crying, and choking. Both \\"wandering womb\\" and \\"hysteria\\" are unused in medical theories of today.

After being colonized first by Jamaica then by British, Cayman Islands remained under British dependency since 1962. Traditional Cayman Islands cuisine is very tied to Jamaican cuisine and they also kept British influences in their cooking, but you can as well find a large variety of international dishes with a local twist. As for traditional dishes the main ingredients are coconut, plantain, cassava, yams, rice and peas. Jamaican cuisine enriched Cayman‚Äôs cuisine by offering a large variety of spices such as jerk, curry and other exotic seasonings. The humid soil provides a large variety of exotic fruits and vegetables such as yellow squash, avocados, callaloo (Caribbean spinach), cassava, calabash, spring onions, pineapples, tomatoes, peas, chili, peppers a great range of citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits, bananas and plantains, sweet potatoes, yams and mangoes. Cuisines of Cayman Islands Cayman Islands cuisine is in a big proportion very similar to Jamaican cuisine and it also preserved specific British influences. Traditional dishes are frequently prepared with fish, seafood, vegetables and spices. Fish and seafood are the main ingredients for any Cayman dish; the most popular are Tuna, turtle, Snapper, mackerel and Mahi-mahi which are usually prepared with tomato, onion and peppers. Cayman Islands are considered to be the homeland of the Conch and Strombus Gigas, a type of Conch, has been the staple dish for ages. Conch is served marinated, in salads, in creamy chowders or in stews. People from Cayman Islands enjoy spicy dishes; a popular spicy sauce in Cayman Islands is chili sauce made of tomatoes, onions, vinegar and peppers. Fish is served for lunch or for dinner grilled, marinated, on salads, stewed and it is also served for breakfast with ackee which is an egg-shaped fruit whose taste is similar to scrambled eggs. Preparation methods Because the fish is the main source of protein for most inhabitants, there are many preparation methods for it as well as for other dishes. Cayman Islands cuisine uses elements from various cooking traditions borrowed from their neighbors and developed from their own traditional dishes. Using the right amount of spices for example is essential ‚Äì either for spicing up the taste or for coloring the dish. The diversity of vegetables and cereals found in Cayman Islands is also noticed in the delicious dishes belonging to their cuisine. The visual attractiveness of the dish is also important, and a balance between colors and proportion differentiates. Each traditional dish has a special cooking method, which is more or less general in all of Cayman Islands regions. Meat is one of the main elements of most Cayman Islands dishes and cured and smoked hams are often parts of delicious dishes. Traditions and festivals There are many festivals and traditions held in Cayman Islands. The national holidays include Constitution Day (July 7), New Year‚Äôs Day (January 1), National Heroes Day (January 23), Discovery Day (May 15), Queen‚Äôs Birthday (June 12), Remembrance Day (November 11),and Christmas Day (December 25). Festivals like Batabano, Cayfest, Pirates Week and food festivals present an opportunity for district cooks to prepare traditional foods that are not always easily accessible. On national holidays people from Cayman Islands serve traditional dishes which mainly contain turtle, Conch, whelks and other local seafood cooked with coconut milk or oil depending on the method of preparation. Plantain, breadfruit, yams, cassava, coco, rice and beans are also included or served on the side. A delicious dish served in restaurants but especially at Christmas in Caymanian homes is Cayman-style beef which is 'picked' almost like a pulled pork.

The operation currently consists of a Hamilton-focused section within the national CBC.ca website, and presences on various social media platforms. The operation was announced on November 1, 2011 as part of the public broadcaster's five year (2011-2015) strategic plan for improving service to various regions across Canada. Unlike most of the other new or expanded regional services that are part of the 2015 strategic plan, the Hamilton operation will not include an over-the-air broadcasting component, due to financial considerations and the fact that Hamilton is within the coverage range of the main transmitters of the corporation's Toronto stations, including CBC Television's CBLT and CBC Radio One's CBLA, which focus their local programming on that city. Moreover, the availability of open radio frequencies in the Toronto-Hamilton region is extremely limited. In the wake of Bell Canada's attempts to acquire Astral Media, Hamilton councillor Brian McHattie called for the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to require that the combined company divest a station to the CBC, to permit the launch of a radio station serving Hamilton. A motion to the CRTC regarding this suggestion was passed unanimously by Hamilton City Council on March 27, 2013. While it did require Bell to divest two FM stations in Toronto when it approved the Bell-Astral merger, the CRTC did not impose a requirement that one of the stations be sold to the CBC; both stations were instead acquired by other private commercial broadcasters.

It is number 16079 on the Estonian State Register of Cultural Monuments. History Kiltsi Manor is first recorded in 1466. It is believed to have been built in the 14th or 15th century in what was then Kiltsi Castle which was destroyed in the Livonian War. In the Middle Ages Kiltsi belonged to the Gilsens, from which it gets its German name Gilsenhof. In the 17th century, Kiltsi was in Asseri parish, and was thus under he ownership of the Uexk√ºll, Zoeged, Mannteuffel, and Rosen families. In 1784 Kiltsi manor was acquired by Major Hermann Johann von Beckendorff, who built a new main house in early classical style (with non-classical turrets) within the manor walls in 1790. From 1816 the manor belonged to famed explorer and scholar Adam Johann von Krusenstern until his death at Kiltsi in 1846. The manor stayed in the Krusenstern family until the early part of the 20th century. The manor‚Äôs last private owner was Alfred von Uexkll-Gyldenband. Since 1920 the manor has been home to a school.

This play takes place entirely within a 24-hour period on a railway sleeping car, and revolves around a woman's late night confusion regarding the premature appearance of her husband and brother. This work is one of Howells' minor works, but reflects the same tendencies towards literary realism as many of Howells' more famous works, including The Rise of Silas Lapham and A Modern Instance. This play is not well-read amongst modern readers, and is often overlooked in literary discussion due to its relative contemporary obscurity. Currently, this work is not being published by any publishing houses, but is available free through Project Gutenberg or other websites. Characters In order of appearance: *Mrs. Agnes Roberts, a new mother who is on her way to Boston to visit her husband and brother. Traveling with her are her baby son and her dear Aunt Mary. *Aunt Mary, the aunt of Mrs. Roberts, a very proud old woman. *The Porter *Angry Voices, the voices of other passengers, who routinely interject their usually critical opinions into the main dialogue. The exact speakers of these angry voices are never revealed. *The Californian, a shaggy-headed and bearded man who encounters Mrs. Roberts and defends her vehemently when she is heckled by other passengers. *The Man in the Upper Berth, a voice with whom the Californian engages in a verbal debate with the Californian over Mrs. Roberts's incessant nighttime conversation. *Mr. Edward Roberts, the husband of Mrs. Roberts. He boards the train at Worcester in an attempt to surprise his wife before Boston. *The Conductor *Willis Campbell, Mrs. Roberts's brother, a San Francisco resident. He boards the train early at Framingham, as he was visiting friends there and was ahead of schedule. Some discussion occurs between Mr. and Mrs. Roberts regarding his identity, but eventually he is positively identified as Mrs. Roberts's brother. Plot This story begins with Mrs. Roberts, her baby son, and her Aunt Mary headed Westbound on the Boston and Albany Railroad. They are on their way to meet Mrs. Roberts' husband and brother in Boston. Mrs. Roberts has not seen her brother in twelve years, and is nervous about how he will react to seeing her. In the time since they last saw each other, she has married and birthed a child, and has heard little from her brother except for infrequent telegraphs. The porter informs Mrs. Roberts and her aunt that the berths are now ready for them to sleep in, but the conversation continues. Mrs. Roberts worries that her husband Edward will not receive Willis well, or vice versa, because Willis is a Californian and Edward has never encountered one before. Mrs. Roberts laments that her life would be a wreck if her husband and brother do not get along nicely, and states \\"I do hope they're sitting down to a hot supper.\\" A voice from an adjacent berth interjects and sarcastically tells Mrs. Roberts to be quiet. She acquiesces for a moment, but then reverts to conversation, stating how they must go to bed. Aunt Mary insists that Mrs. Roberts and the child take the bottom bunk, because she is afraid that the child will roll off of the top bunk and injure himself. She calls the porter over to help her into the upper berth, and after successfully entering the berth, exchanges \\"good-night\\" with Mrs. Roberts. After a few minutes, Mrs. Roberts rekindles the conversation, and expresses her concern regarding the safety of the train on which they're riding. Her aunt reassures her that the road is safe, and that the train has implemented safety measures to prevent accidents. Mrs. Roberts then goes on to discuss where her Aunt left the drinking glass in their luggage, until she is interrupted by a man from the next berth. This man politely requests silence from Mrs. Roberts, citing that he has come straight through from San Francisco and would very much like some rest. Mrs. Roberts responds apologetically, but starts conversing with this man, inquiring about California, her brother Willis, and if he has ever met his acquaintance. Midway through their conversation, a man in the upper berth sarcastically interjects and asks for quiet. The Californian takes offense to the man's tone towards Mrs. Roberts, and the two get into a verbal argument over it. Eventually, the Californian gets the man in the upper berth to back down (\\"You beg that lady's pardon, or I'll have you out of there before you know yourself!\\"). Part I ends with the Californian and Mrs. Roberts finally going to bed, with only the sounds of Aunt Mary's snoring audible. Part II begins with Edward boarding the train at Worcester. After confirming the train's identity with the porter, Mr. Roberts attempts to search for his wife. Of course, he does not know which berth houses his wife, and he tries to jog the porter's memory with details about his wife and her traveling companions. The conductor joins the conversation, and finally all decide to wait until morning to search for Mr. Roberts's wife, when all the passengers will be awake. Edward settles into a seat on the train, and noticies what appears to be his wife's bonnet hanging from a hook next to one of the berths. The porter says that a man is in that berth, but convinced by the bonnet, Edward decides to take a chance and enter the berth, bribing the porter to allow him to do so. Of course, the berth that Edward enters is the berth of the Californian, who is not pleased that someone has again interrupted his slumber. The Californian confronts Mr. Roberts, who attempts to talk his way out of the situation. Mrs. Roberts wakes up from this noise, and comes to her husband's side. The conductor comes to see what all the fuss is about, and it is the Californian who confesses to making the noise. The conductor decides that his problem with the Californian is not worth a confrontation. (\\"[If I had a problem], I'd get the biggest brakeman to do it for me.\\") Mr. Edwards apologizes to the Californian for waking him, and invites him to call on them whenever he pleases. The Californian returns to his berth, and Mrs. Roberts fills her husband in on the events of the sleeping car thus far. She realizes she has neglected the child during this brief kerfuffle, and dashes back to her berth to check on him. Mrs. Roberts selects the wrong berth, and again interrupts the Californian's sleep. She explains that she was looking for her child, and the Californian decides to help the Roberts' look for their baby son. The Californian finds Mrs. Roberts's berth on his first attempt, and Mrs. Roberts shrieks with excitement. Again, the Californian returns to his berth. However, Mrs. Roberts remains awake. She comes to the sudden and unrelenting realization that the Californian is in fact her brother Willis. (\\"It accounts for his being so polite and kind to me through all [of this].\\") Obsessed and sincere in her conviction of this thought, she and her husband yet again interrupt the sleep of the Californian, pulling open he curtains and accusing him of being her brother. The Californian jokingly rejects this premise, and assures them that he most certainly is not Willis Campbell. Disappointed and deeply sorry for again interrupting his sleep, Mr. and Mrs. Roberts return to their berth. Thus ends Part II. Part III begins with a passenger boarding the train the next day. The porter shows this gentleman to a seat across from where the Roberts' sit. Mrs. Roberts notices the name on the bag says \\"Willis Campbell, San Francisco.\\" Although this evidence should be plenty for Mrs. Roberts to immediately confront this stranger about his identity, she hesitates, and is worried that she will further humiliate herself if this person is not her brother. Eventually, she gathers the courage to ask him, and the two discover that they are indeed brother and sister. Mrs. Roberts fills in her brother on the past antics of the journey in the sleeping car, and upon hearing the description of the Californian, is convinced that he is Tom Goodall, an old acquaintance of his. However, the Californian is named Abram Sawyer, and again he has woken up for frivolous purposes. As the train is quickly approaching Boston, Mr. Roberts suggests that Aunt Mary be woken up so that she may prepare for arrival. Aunt Mary is informed that both Edward and Willis have boarded the sleeping car overnight, and meets the acquaintance of the Californian. Upon hearing his name, Aunt Mary is convinced that she knows him as the daughter of her old friend Kate Harris. Clearly, this accusation is ridiculous, and the voices of the other sleeping car passengers make some jokes about it. The play ends with Aunt Mary requesting for the porter to help her down from the upper berth. Analysis, themes, and motifs Analysis: This play is a farce, revolving around the absurdity of mistaken identity. The humor in this play lies in this constant mistaken identity, in the neurosis of Mrs. Roberts, in the interjections from the other passengers, and in the heartbreaking inability of the Californian to sleep. The person for whom identity is most frequently mistaken is the Californian, who frequently bears the brunt of false identity accusations. Mrs. Roberts, Willis, and Aunt Mary all claim to know the Californian, but none of them do, of course. The Californian himself seems to realize the humor in this, and states \\"I've been a baby twice, and I've been a man's wife once, and once I've been a long-lost brother.\\" The neurosis of Mrs. Roberts is another point of humor. She frequently states \\"good-night\\" to Aunt Mary in part I, but always revives the conversation by expressing some sort of worry, insecurity, or anxiety. Mrs. Roberts expresses initially her worry about how her brother and husband will interact, and needs constant reassurance from her aunt to calm down. Minutes later, she is concerned about the safety of the train, whose creaking noises stir worry about her safety and the safety of her baby son. Aunt Mary again alleviates her stress by citing all of the safety measures the railroad has implemented (i.e. the well-managed road, air-brake, and Miller Platform). After this anxiety passes, Mrs. Roberts frets about where the water glass is packed in the luggage, and decides to talk herself through its retrieval. The intense neurosis of Mrs. Roberts is comically pathetic, and quite extreme. Effortlessly moving from one point of anxiety to the next, Mrs. Roberts creates a feeling of persistent neurosis for the reader, who must simply laugh at the woeful worry. The interjections from the other passengers are also quite comedic. Their comments, largely sarcastic and witty, provide a more typical and colloquial humor to the play than the humor of ridiculousness. The sarcasm of the man in the upper berth for instance, exemplifies this comedy: \\"I could lie here and listen to it all night; but there are invalids in some of these berths, and perhaps on their account it will be as well to defer everything till the morning.\\" Furthermore, interjections from other passengers such as \\"Train robbers! Throw up your hands! Tell the express-messenger to bring his safe!\\" add more blatantly sarcastic humor to the story. The inability of the Californian to sleep is humorous in its own right, especially since the first words that the Californian speaks are a sincere appeal to Mrs. Roberts for silence. The Californian has not slept in a while, and it appears that his only priority is catching up on his sleep. This sincere desire for sleep makes the constant awakening of the Californian even more heartbreakingly humorous. At one point he is awakened (quite startlingly) twice in a row, first by Mr. Roberts and then by Mrs. Roberts, who somehow mistakes the Californian's berth for the berth she emerged from seconds prior. One starts to empathize with the Californian, and all one can do when he is interrupted time and time again is to chuckle. Also, there is comedic value in the irony of the title. The play is called The Sleeping Car, yet very little sleep is to be found for those on it. Furthermore, this play exemplifies William Dean Howells's dedication to Literary realism. Howells was quite weary about romanticism, and thought it to be a cause of the American Civil War. Thus, he focused on authenticity, and practiced fidelity to representing ordinary people who were, in many instances, his contemporaries. This passion for authentic representation certainly did not earn Howells the title of being the most exciting author of his time, and rather added to his reputation for mundane and ordinary tales. The Sleeping Car is certainly no exception to the Howellsian plot. In this play there is only one setting, and the action all revolves around mistaken identity. Other than a few misunderstandings, nothing of importance or excitement happens in this book. The characters begin on a sleeping car, have some slight misunderstandings, meet some new people, and end (rather undeveloped) right where they began, on the same sleeping car. Furthermore, the lack of a narrator in this play means that the reader objectively receives the plot, and is not subject to bias or interpretation of a third party. Howells was known for his deep anxiety about industrialism and finance, and the growth of the urban metropolis. This anxiety is exemplified in his other works, such as The Rise of Silas Lapham, but is certainly also visible in The Sleeping Car. The characters in this play, with the exception of the Californian, all share an intimate bond. They are connected through family, and presumably they hail from similar places. However, with the urbanization and growth of America, people lose their intimacy with one another, creating confusion. In The Sleeping Car, Mrs. Roberts is from a different part of America than her brother Willis and the Californian. Mrs. Roberts's utter confusion about the true identity of these two men perfectly exemplifies Howells's point about the rise of the metropolis creating obfuscation. Themes and motifs: *Differences between the American West (specifically California) and Northeast :Mrs. Roberts worries about her husband not getting along with her brother, a californian. Moreover, the Californian in the play encounters the absurdity and restlessness of Northeastern America. *Mistaken Identity :Examples of this theme are abundant, from Mrs. Roberts thinking the Californian is her brother to Aunt Mary thinking the Californian is the daughter of a woman she knew. *Beginning of the Metropolis :People don't know each other as intimately as they do in small, rural towns, and this mass population creates identity uncertainty. *Impulsiveness :This theme is exemplified most obviously by Mrs. Roberts, who states her mind at will and simply will not shut up. She barges into other people's berths and typically acts prior to thinking. Critical reception Due to the widespread influence of William Dean Howells during the late 1800s, this book was most likely fairly well read by people of that time, although probably not as widely read as other works of his. There is no information on sales of the book. In a May 1883 issue of The Atlantic, a reviewer states the following about The Sleeping Car. :\\"Mr. Howell's farce of The Sleeping Car (Osgood), comes very near being the most delightful thing he has written. The humor and ingenuity of this piece are rare both in kind and degree.\\" In an August 1889 issue of The Atlantic, the author expresses that The Sleeping Car and Howells's other farces have entertained readers, who have in general responded quite positively to it. The Sleeping Car is also referenced in a submission to the editor in the February 1886 version of Harper's Magazine, indicating that this work indeed reached a widespread audience, gaining popularity (or at least some readership), amongst the readers of both Harper's Magazine and The Atlantic. There is no evidence in modern online journals or databases to suggest that these views of The Sleeping Car have changed much, if at all, since the late 1800s.

Its western segment, entirely known as 55th Street, runs east from Maple Avenue in Downers Grove until it becomes Joliet Road in Countryside. Its eastern segment, known only as Garfield Boulevard from Western Avenue in Gage Park to Elsworth Drive in Washington Park, runs east from Archer Avenue and Narragansett Avenue to South Shore Drive, just west of U.S. Route 41 (Lake Shore Drive). All of the eastern segment of 55th Street lies within the city limits of Chicago. Route description 55th Street begins at Maple Avenue in Downers Grove. In Clarendon Hills, the street intersects Illinois Route 83 (Kingery Highway). As the road continues east into Hinsdale, 55th Street crosses from DuPage County to Cook County at County Line Road. Just east of the county line, the road passes over Interstate 294 (Tri-State Tollway). In Countryside, 55th Street intersects U.S. Route 12/U.S. Route 20/U.S. Route 45 (LaGrange Road). The western segment ends about one mile further east when the road becomes Joliet Road. The two segments of 55th Street are split because Interstate 55 (Stevenson Expressway) runs in its path if it were to continue in either direction. 55th Street resumes at Archer Avenue and Narragansett Avenue near the western city limits of Chicago. From Central Avenue to Illinois Route 50 (Cicero Avenue), 55th Street serves as the northern boundary for Midway Airport. The next three roads that intersect 55th Street are Pulaski Road, Kedzie Avenue, and Western Avenue. At Western Avenue, 55th Street officially becomes Garfield Boulevard. Garfield Boulevard continues east, intersecting Halsted Street. About three-fourths of a mile further east, Garfield Boulevard intersects Interstate 90/Interstate 94 (Dan Ryan Expressway). After this intersection, the road intersects State Street and Michigan Avenue. At Elsworth Drive in Washington Park, Garfield Boulevard is redesignated as 55th Street, intersecting Cottage Grove Avenue shortly east of this point. From Cottage Grove Avenue to University Avenue, 55th Street forms the northern boundary of the University of Chicago campus. 55th Street finally intersects South Shore Drive, where the street continues east until a cul-de-sac just west of U.S. Route 41 (Lake Shore Drive). History The section of the street renamed Garfield Boulevard was named to honor the twentieth president, James A. Garfield after his assassination in 1881. The same was the case with the naming of Garfield Park.

The story tells of a child with autism, and a walk with his sisters (who are frustrated with his stereotypical behaviour), and how they begin to understand him after he wanders off. Ian's Walk is regarded as a useful tool to help family members of children with autism understand associated behaviours. Plot Ian's Walk tells the story of a child with autism named Ian. Ian displays behaviour which is stereotypical for children with autism, to the dismay of his sister Julie. Julie and Tara (the oldest sibling) decide to go for a walk to the park, but their mother says that Ian must go with them. During the walk Julie describes Ian's behaviour to the reader, and describes her frustration and embarrassment with it, and Ian. Along the walk Ian goes missing, causing Julie to panic. She decides to \\"think like Ian\\" and finds him at his favourite spot. She takes him home, and begins to appreciate and accept how different he is. Reception and use as an educational resource Ian's Walk is described as being \\"straightforward and honest. It evokes compassion without pity\\", with the depictions of Ian being \\"accurate and authentic\\". A Booklist review says; \\"Through its simple plot, the story conveys a complex family relationship and demonstrates the ambivalent emotions Julie feels about her autistic brother.\\" Ian's Walk is recommended to help adults and children (particularly siblings of children with autism) understand how children with autism are different. One critic commented, \\"it does not give enough specific information to be truly useful\\". The medium used (a picture-book with watercolour illustrations by Karen Ritz) might not be enough to be useful for an older audience, but is appealing to younger readers as in introduction to autism and the associated behaviours. Roseane Steitz's review said the book is aimed at a 6 to 9 year old audience and that it could be used for bibliotherapy or in a class that includes autistic children. The book contains an explanatory preface for parents by Carol P. Rolland, Chief Psychologist, Developmental Pediatrics, and Mary Kay McGuire, Sibling Program Director at Illinois Masonic Medical Center.

It should be distinguished from dynamic convex hull data structures, which handle points undergoing discrete changes such as insertions or deletions of points rather than continuous motion. The 2D case The best known data structure for the 2-dimensional kinetic convex hull problem is by Basch, Guibas, and Hershberger. This data structure is responsive, efficient, compact and local. =The data structure= The dual of a convex hull of a set of points is the upper and lower envelopes of the dual set of lines. Therefore, maintaining the upper and lower envelopes of a set of moving lines is equivalent to maintaining the convex hull of a set of moving points. Computing upper and lower envelopes are equivalent problems, so computing the upper envelope of a set of lines is equivalent to computing the convex hull of a set of moving points. The upper envelope of a set of static lines can be computed using a divide and conquer algorithm which partitions the lines into two sets of equal size, calls itself recursively on the two sets to find their upper envelopes, and then merges the two resulting upper envelopes. The merge step is performed using a vertical line sweep. Call the first set of points blue and the second set of points red. The standard line sweep algorithm for merging upper envelopes sweeps though all of vertices of the red and blue upper envelopes, from left to right. The most recently encountered red and blue points are maintained as the line sweeps. When a point is encountered, the algorithm checks if the point is above or below the segment following the last encountered point of the opposite color. If it is above, that point is added to the merged upper envelope. If it is of a different color than the last added point, the red and blue envelopes have crossed, so the intersection point is also added to the merged upper envelope. The sequence of edges and vertices resulting from this algorithm is only dependent on the ordering of points, and the results of the line-point comparisons. Thus, the result can be certified with the following certificates: *x-certificates (<_x) are used to certify the order the vertices of the red and blue envelopes. They are the certificates for a kinetic sorted list on the set of vertices. Since each point involves 2 lines, and the certificate involves 2 points, each certificate involves 4 lines. *y-certificates (<_y) are used to certify that a vertex is above or below an edge. The certificates appear for all comparisons that would occur during the algorithm. As long as all of these certificates hold, the merge steps will be executed identically, so the resulting upper envelope will be the same. A kinetic data structure for upper envelopes can be created by using these certificates to certify the static upper envelope algorithm. However, this scheme is not local, because one line many be involved in many y-certificates if it remains on top or bottom as many points from the other envelope are encountered. Thus, it is necessary to introduce a s-certificates (<_s) which certifies that the slope of a line is greater than or less than the slope of another line. Having the following certificates for all points ab is sufficient to certify the sequence of edges and vertices resulting from a merge, with only O(1) certificates per line:The certificates certify structure of the intersection of the red and blue envelopes by certifying intersections(top left) or the absence of intersections(top right and bottom). The arrows indicate which elements are being compared by the certificate. #x[ab]: ab<_x ab.next. ab.next denotes vertex closest to ab on its right. This certificate is stored for all points ab which have a different color than the point, ab.next, which follows them. #yli[ab]: ab<_y ce(ab) or ab>_y ce(ab). This certificate is stored for all points ab such that b intersects ce(ab). ce(ab) denotes the contender edge of ab, the edge from the other envelope that is above or below ab. #yri[ab]: ab<_y ce(ab) or ab>_y ce(ab). This certificate is stored for all points ab such that a intersects ce(ab). #yt[ab]: ce(ab)<_yab. This certificate is stored for all points ab for which a<_sce(ab)<_s b and ce(ab)<_yab. #srt[ab]: a<_sce(ab). This certificate is stored for all points ab for which a<_sce(ab)<_s b and ce(ab)<_yab. #srt[ab]: ce(ab)<_s b. This certificate is stored for all points ab for which a<_sce(ab)<_s b and ce(ab)<_yab. #sl[ab]: b<_sce(ab). This certificate is stored for all points ab for which b<_sce(ab) and ab<_yce(ab). #sr[ab]: ce(ab)<_sa. This certificate is stored for all points ab for which ce(ab)<_sa and ab<_yce(ab). The first certificate, x[ab], certifies the x-ordering of the points in the red and blue envelopes. The second and third certificates, yli[ab] and yri[ab], certify intersections of the red and blue envelopes. The remaining 5 certificates, yt[ab], srt[ab], srt[ab], sl[ab], and sr[ab] place edges that are not in the upper envelopes in the sequence of slopes of the edges that are above it. If the slope is at the start or end of the sequence, sl or sr certify this. If it is in the middle of the sequence slt, and srt certify this, and yt certifies that the intersection point of the two lines that the edge's slope is in between, is above it. These one or three certificates suffice to prove that all of the edges are above this line. Unlike the previous scheme all lines are only involved in a constant number of certificates. Whenever of these certificates fail, the merged envelope and certificates can be updated in O(1) time. The kinetic data structure for convex hull is constructed by using these certificates to certify the recursive merge of the upper envelopes. Whenever certificates fail, their merge is updated, and if the envelope resulting from the merge changes, the changes are propagated up through all merges that depend on the result of the merge. = Performance = This data structure is responsive, local, compact, and efficient. This is due to the logarithmic depth of the merges used to certify the upper envelope. *Responsive: When a certificate fails, it takes O(1) to fix the merge it certifies. If the resulting envelope changes, the change must be propagated up to all merges that depend on the result of the changed merge. There are O(log n) such mergers, so the update can be performed in O(log n) time total. *Local: Each line is involved in a most O(log n) certificates. This is because each line is involved in a constant number of certificates in each merge, and each line is in O(log n) merges total. *Compactness: The maximum number of certificates used in this data structure is O(n log n). This is because each merge involves a number of certificates linear to the number of lines merged. Certifying an upper envelope of n lines requires certificates for the merge upper envelope of the two subsets of n/2 lines, and certificates for the merge of the envelopes. Thus the number of certificates, C(n), required to certify the upper envelope of n lines satisfies the recurrence C(n)=2C(n/2)+O(n), with C(1)=O(1). By the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences, C(n)=O(n log n). *Efficiency: The maximum number of events processed by this algorithm on algebraic or pseudo- algebraic trajectories is near quadratic, O(n^{2+\\\\epsilon}) for all \\\\epsilon>0.

Federal Housing Finance Agency was a California state case in which several California-based plaintiffs filed suit against the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for creating a lending rule that impeded the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program, a program in which property owners repay energy-related property improvements gradually over time (typically 15‚Äì20 years) as an addition to their property tax. Background Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs are local government initiatives that pay for up-front costs of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects on a property. The property owner pays back these costs over time (up to 20 years) as an addition to their residential or commercial property tax. The tax remains a part of the property and is transferred from owner to owner until the upgrade costs are paid off. There are little to no up-front costs for the property owner and an average homeowner will save more money on their monthly utility bill than the increase in their property tax bill. The City of Berkeley's Financing Initiative for Renewable and Solar Technology (FIRST) program, which was adopted in 2008, was an early example of how PACE programs could help eliminate many financial hurdles facing property owners eager to install solar panels on their homes. Following the success of the Berkeley FIRST program, several other local governments in California (e.g., City of Palm Desert, City of San Diego, and Sonoma County) followed suit and the state passed Assembly Bill 811 to allow any local government to implement PACE-type programs. Since 2008, PACE has been adopted by 27 other states. PACE programs, like all other municipal assessments, require a lien to be placed on the mortgage payment in the event of a default. Due to the recent mortgage crisis, lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were hesitant to offer loans associated with PACE programs for fear of potential risk. The FHFA backed the lenders‚Äô claims and issued a statement in 2010, putting a halt to PACE programs nationwide. The statement issued in 2010, also known as 'Directives', indicated FHFA's concerns towards energy retrofit lending programs. The FHFA determined that the PACE program presented \\"significant safety and soundness concerns\\" because of inherent characteristics of the lending program. The FHFA believed that these types of loans would be difficult to manage due to the size and duration of PACE loans, would present significant risk to lenders due to \\"key alteration[s] of traditional mortgage lending practices\\", and would result in collateral-based lending based on uncertain reductions from energy retrofits. In California, the Attorney General filed suit, quickly followed by Sonoma and Placer County, the Sierra Club, and the City of Palm Desert. All four cases have been consolidated. Parties The plaintiffs are the People of the State of California (represented by Attorney General Kamala Harris; originally Edmund G. Brown Jr. in 2010), Sonoma and Placer Counties, the Sierra Club and the City of Palm Desert. The defendants are the Federal Housing Finance Agency (represented by Acting Director Edward DeMarco), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (represented by Chief Executive Officer Charles E. Haldeman Jr.), and the Federal National Mortgage Association (represented by Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Williams). Issues and arguments In order to invoke the court's jurisdiction, the plaintiffs must prove that they have constitutional ‚Äòstanding‚Äô. As such, the three elements required to satisfy Article III Standing are (1) injury in fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability. The Plaintiffs argue that their ‚Äòinjuries in fact‚Äô include: interference with state, county, and city PACE law; lost opportunities for participation in PACE programs; lost opportunities to reduce the effects of climate change. With regards to causation and redressability, the plaintiffs argue that the FHFA decision failed to undergo the proper procedure of identifying environmental considerations. The Plaintiffs also argue that the FHFA's anti-PACE directives violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) notice-and-comment requirements, 5 U.S.C. section 553. The Plaintiffs allege that the Directives issued in 2010 serve as FHFA's regulations and ‚Äúfinal agency action,‚Äù not mere guidance because they reflected a change from previous policy. Therefore, the Plaintiffs assert that the FHFA is required to follow the APA's requirements and give notice of the Directives or provide a formal public comment period. In other words, the FHFA created law without undergoing the proper procedures. Therefore, failure to follow APA requirements empowers the court to vacate the directives or to instruct the FHFA to follow proper APA procedure. Another contention is that FHFA is overreaching its power as Conservator. The Plaintiffs argue that Congress never explicitly granted the FHFA substantive rule-making power. According to the Plaintiffs, the FHFA also violated the APA because the Directives were arbitrary and capricious due to FHFA's failure to provide substantial evidence of ‚Äòrisk,‚Äô failure to consider existing data from PACE programs, and failure to consider alternative measures prior to a blanket prohibition on PACE. If the court finds that the Agency did not violate the APA, the Plaintiffs then argue that the FHFA violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for failure to take a ‚Äúhard look‚Äù at the impacts resulting from action or inaction of the FHFA due to the Directives. NEPA requires preparation of an environmental assessment, or environmental impact statement, prior to major federal action that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment. The Defendants argue that the Directives issued in 2010 are to serve as guidelines, not regulations, and therefore not subject to APA requirements. In addition, according to their charter, as Conservator, the FHFA is obligated to take any action to provide a safe and sound housing market. Furthermore, the FHFA argues that Congress intended for the Conservator to be able to take action without interference from any state or federal agency, or court. The main issue, as argued by the Defendants, is that PACE loans are characteristically ‚Äòrisky‚Äô due to the additional costs for home-owners. The Defendants contend that these loans increase the burden on home-owners, thereby creating a likelihood for the home-owner to default. And because PACE loans acquire priority lien, they take precedence over mortgage liens. The Defendants also requested for dismissal of the Plaintiffs‚Äô claims, for failure to state a claim. In other words, the Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs only offered speculative claims rather than legitimate contentions. The Defendants allege that the court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs‚Äô claims because the FHFA acted within its powers as granted by Congress. In addition, the relief sought by Plaintiffs would restrain and severely hinder FHFA's purpose of preserving and conserving the assets and property of the lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Defendants argue protection under federal preemption because federal law preempts state-law. In addition, the FHFA argues that the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) intended to delegate authority for the purpose of providing a safe and sound housing market. The Defendants allege that if states were able to impose PACE first- lien mortgages, these mortgages would undermine the effectiveness of the FHFA because of the lack of uniformity. Furthermore, the Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs‚Äô APA claims fail because the FHFA was not created to protect environmental interests. As stated in the charters for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were created to ensure the safe and sound operation of the mortgage markets. With the absence of APA jurisdiction, the Defendants argue for dismissal of the Plaintiffs‚Äô NEPA claims. The Defendants assert that NEPA does not contain a private right of action, and therefore are reviewable if jurisdiction exists. However, the court does not have jurisdiction under APA, and therefore does not have jurisdiction under NEPA. In addition, in response to the Plaintiffs‚Äô claim of violation of NEPA, the Defendants assert that the Directives issued in 2010 did not require that municipalities shut down their PACE programs, thus maintaining that the Directives were not a federal regulation. Court decision Judge Claudia Wilken denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case on August 26, 2011 and on September 13, 2011 issued a preliminary injunction requiring FHFA to begin rulemaking on PACE. FHFA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on January 26, 2012, with public comments due by March 26, 2012. The plaintiffs filed for a motion of summary judgement to be heard on May 3, 2012. Other PACE litigation In the State of New York, the Town of Babylon and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed separate cases against the FHFA. Both cases are to be heard in tandem in June 2012. In the State of Florida, Leon County filed suit against FHFA. As of May 2012, no hearing date has been set.

One edition was part of a $14 million 2012 lawsuit regarding a 2009 sale, while another sold in 2010 for $4.9 million. Although it uses Ben-Day dots like many other Lichtenstein works, it was inspired by the New York City Subway rather than directly from a panel of a romance comics work. Analysis Girl in Mirror uses Ben-Day dots like many of his other works, but it was inspired by the hard reflective finish of signs in the New York City Subway system and, in turn, they inspired his subsequent ceramic head works. Enamel facilitated a more mechanical appearance than even his paintings while remaining in two dimensions. After 1963, Lichtenstein's comics-based women \\"... look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup.\\" This particular example is one of several that is cropped so closely that the hair flows beyond the edges of the canvas. Editions One edition of this painting was the subject of a legal dispute involving 2009 sale without consent. Another edition of this work sold at auction at Christie's (New York, Rockefeller Plaza ) Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale for $4,898,500 (premium) on November 10, 2010 although it was only expected to sell in the $3‚Äì4 million range. Girl in Mirror exists in eight editions according to most, however, \\"Clare Bell of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation said that inventory records for the Leo Castelli Gallery, where Lichtenstein showed in the 1960s, say that there may be 10 versions of the work, some of them original proofs\\". One edition exhibited at the Gagosian Gallery in New York in 2008. There had been three previous auction sales of this work: May 5, 1986 at Sotheby's New York for $ 100,000 USD (hammer), May 4, 1987 at Sotheby's New York for $150,000 USD (hammer), and May 15, 2007 Sotheby's New York for $3,600,000 (hammer)/$4,072,000 (premium). 2012 lawsuit On January 18, 2012, a suit was filed in Manhattan in New York State Court in a case related to two earlier federal cases. The suit alleges both lack of consent and fraudulent misrepresentation of the painting's condition. The suit was for $14 million, including $10 million in punitive damages. 93-year-old Jan Cowles claims that in 2008 her son, New York art dealer Charles Cowles, transferred a version of Girl in Mirror to Larry Gagosian for sale without her consent. The suit claims that Gagosian fraudulently claimed the painting was damaged and sold it between August and December 2009 for $2 million, while charging a $1 million commission, rather than sell at or above the $3 million low estimate for a negotiated commission of $500,000. As a result of the edition shown during the summer 2008 \\"Roy Lichtenstein: Girls\\" exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery, at one point the gallery was in possession of two editions of Girl in Mirror, one of which was damaged. The intake notes for the Cowles version indicate no damage and Gagosian's international marketing of the work was consistent with the undamaged condition. Reception The New York Times notes that this was an example of Lichtenstein's ability to \\"glorify the American woman by giving innocuous images of her generic concocted self and her roiling emotions such blazing formal power\\". Framing a small fragment of the image in the mirror serves an artistic purpose. \\"Extraordinary sections like ... linking the falling hair to the semi-reflected face of the girl in the mirror (Girl in the mirror, 1964) ... which cut up, analyse, and unite, all have the one aim of intensifying the signifying fragment.\\" See also *1964 in art Notes External links *Lichtenstein Foundation website *Gagosian Gallery Exhibition website Category:1964 paintings Category:Paintings by Roy Lichtenstein ","title":"Girl in Mirror"},{"id":"35773111","text":"√Üolus, also spelt Aeolus (or frequently Eolus), was a snow sailing ship built in 1783 at √Öbenr√• in Denmark as a West Indiaman.

Despite the advice of British Colonel John Byrne Skerrett to evacuate the town, Copons decided to hold out. Some wanted to evacuate to and defend the small island that was attached by a causeway from the town. Tarifa is located on Route 340 on the southernmost tip of Spain, or about southeast of Cadiz. The siege occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Troops General of Division Jean Fran√ßois Leval commanded a corps of 15,000 soldiers, with 8,000 present with 16 siege guns. His French troops included three battalions of the 16th Light Infantry Regiment, two battalions each of the 43rd, 51st, 54th, 63rd, 94th, and 95th Line Infantry Regiments, and one battalion each of the 27th Light and 8th Line Infantry Regiments. Leval's Polish contingent was made up of two battalions each of the 7th and 9th Infantry Regiments and his cavalry comprised four squadrons each of the 16th and 21st Dragoon Regiments.Smith (1998), 373 General Francisco Copons led the defenders, who numbered under 3,000 men and 26 guns. His Spanish brigade included one battalion each of the Irlanda and Cantabria Infantry Regiments, one company of Cazadores (sharpshooters), 120 gunners, and 25 cavalrymen. Colonel John Byrne Skerrett's British brigade consisted of the 2nd Battalion of the 47th Foot, 1st Battalion of the 82nd Foot, 2nd Battalion of the 87th Foot, the flank companies of the 1st Battalion of the 11th Foot, one company of the 95th Rifles, one-half squadron of the 2nd King's German Legion Hussar Regiment, and one foot artillery battery. Siege A map of Tarifa and the surrounding area during the siege The French drove the advanced posts of the garrison in on 19 December and surveyed the town to decide on their point of attack. Seeing the apparent advantage of the high ground to the east, they opened trenches on 22 December and by dawn on 29 December were ready to fire their sixteen-pounder cannon. It only took a few hours for the walls to tumble down and to make a large breach. The small walled town of Tarifa seemed almost impossible to defend. Overlooked at short range by higher ground, with walls unprotected against artillery fire, it would easily fall to a serious attack. Skerrett proposed abandoning the defence and embarking on ships. Captain C.F. Smith of the Corps of Royal Engineers strongly opposed the idea. he had noted that inside the walls, the ground level was much lower which combined with a deep narrow river that flowed through the town would make that assault quite hazardous. Skerrett was checkmated when the ships were ordered back to Gibraltar, the commanders being forbidden to embark a single soldier, by General Campbell, the Governor of Gibraltar. Smith having foreseen where the French would attack had prepared internal defences against the impending assault. The 14 foot sheer drop inside the wall would trap the French from retreating and every house overlooking the area was loopholed and garrisoned, with retrenchments formed to trap the enemy. All debris was cleared from inside the wall, despite the grape being fired by the besiegers. Surrender terms were offered and refused. The night of 29/30 December had very heavy rain, with the portcullis defending the river entrance bent inwards by the flood of water and the defences requiring quick repairs before the French attacked at dawn. French Grenadiers advanced along the now dry river bed trying to enter through the portcullis, however it held and the 87th Regiment blunted their attack with withering fire. Moving to their left they tried for the breach, and meeting more fire, retreating back to the river bed, which was covered by a cannon mounted on a tower, firing grape, they huddled amongst their dead and wounded until they eventually retreated back to their camp. This was the only attack that was made, the weather became extremely inclement for several days, the torrential rain damaging the French batteries and trenches so that on the night of 4 January 1812, they were heard pulling back. Going over to the offensive, the Allies sallied forth in the morning, forcing the French to retreat, leaving their siege equipment behind. Aftermath Leval withdrew after making his one abortive assault and seeing sickness begin to ravage his soldiers. Unable to extract their heavy siege artillery from the mud, the besiegers destroyed and abandoned most of their cannons. W Napier wrote \\"Tarifa was worth the efforts made in its defence and aside from the courage and devotion of the troops, without which nothing could have been effected, the merit chiefly appertains to Charles Smith, the Captain of Engineers.... to the British Engineer, therefore belongs the praise of this splendid action.\\" Charles Felix Smith went on to take part in many more conflicts over the next 30 years. He became a Lieutenant General and was knighted. General Francisco Copons y Navia went on to fight many more battles alongside the British, his shining star failing on the return to Spain of King Fernando VII. The French did not return to Tarifa and their Siege of Cadiz was abandoned in August 1812, whereafter, over the next year, the French would gradually retreat all the way back to France.

He is best known for his criticism of New Confucianism, which according to him, deviated from the original Confucian principles and is overly influenced by Western liberal democracy. He proposes an alternative path for China: Constitutional Confucianism, also known as Political Confucianism, or Institutional Confucianism, through the trilateral parliament framework. He believes that China's ongoing political and social problems are to be solved by the revival of and commitment to authentic Confucianism in China. He also argues that Confucian materials should replace the Marxist curriculum taught in universities and government party schools.Xiuping Hong, \\"The Characteristics and Prospect of the Confucian Academy: A Commentary on Jiang Qing‚Äôs Ideas on the Confucian Academy.\\", The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China, edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, Historical context For more than two thousand years, Confucianism has helped to define Chinese culture, tradition, and philosophy; it has contributed to a stable and harmonious society. The Chinese people held a very distinctive notion of the state, family, and social relationships such as guanxi. Nevertheless, challenges from foreign powers and internal problems in the country inevitably led to the political Xinhai Revolution when the people overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Fundamental changes to the orientation of the culture were necessary for China to continue to strive in the modern world. In the attempt to save Confucian morality, philosophers such as Liang Shuming, Tang Junyi, and Mou Zongsan advocated New Confucianism, which arguably came out as the byproduct of philosophical synthesis between Chinese and the Western values. Jiang believes this is problematic because it neglects the institutional dimension of the traditional Confucianism, or the wangdao (kingly system). In short, New Confucianism is not authentic due to its insistence on projecting Confucianism in terms of the modern Western political institution of liberal democracy.Jiang Qing, \\"From Mind Confucianism to Political Confucianism.\\", The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China, edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, Biography Jiang Qing was born October 1, 1953 in Guiyang to a relatively affluent family. As a child, he had a passion for Chinese poetry and classical literature. The political situation at the time drove him to undertake studies of Marxism and human rights theories of the West during his university years. Later on, perplexed by China's political reality, he studied both eastern and western religion. Eventually, he studied New Confucianism, which on the one hand advocates the mind philosophy and self-cultivation, and on the other hand tries to fit Confucian ideologies into the framework of Western liberal democracy. Given his deep appreciation and knowledge of the classics, especially the Gongyang Zhuan commentary, and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he was determined to find a solution for China's struggles. He believed that an embrace of Western ideas, especially democratic politics, liberty, and equality, is not suitable for China's development. This brought about his criticism of the New Confucianism, and his plan for China, which involved drawing on its own long-standing metaphysical moral and political values, as well as national identity, all of which are fundamentally different from Western ideologies. He also founded the Yangming Academy (:zh:Èò≥ÊòéÁ≤æËàç), a Confucian-based educational institution in 1996.Erica Yu and Meng Fan, \\"A Confucian Coming of Age.\\" Chapter 15 in Section III, \\"A Note on Jiang Qing\\", The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China, edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, Criticism of New Confucianism Arguing that New Confucianism is exclusively concerned with the existential life of human individuals and their minds, Jiang calls it Mind Confucianism, perhaps to highlight how it focuses on individual moral development rather the Chinese institutional aspect that Gongyang Zhuan advocates, more specifically the idea of wangdao (ÁéãÈÅì \\"kingly way; benevolent government\\"),John DeFrancis (2003), ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary, University of Hawaii Press, p. 974. loosely translated as ‚ÄúWay of the Humane Authority.‚ÄùThis Chinese word wangdao \\"kingly way\\" was used in Japanese propaganda during World War II. Succinctly, wangdao is a set of criteria for which a legitimate ruler meets. It consists mainly of three parts: transcendence (from heaven), history and culture (from earth) and the will (from human). These conditions essentially ensure an orderly society, in which the people dutifully obey their rightful ruler. In short, New Confucianism is not authentic for it incorrectly attempts to project Confucianism in terms of modern Western political institution of liberal democracy.Jiang Qing, From Mind Confucianism to Political Confucianism. As such, Jiang claims that there are problems with New Confucianism. First, it overtly focuses on the ideas of individuality and self-cultivation, causing familial and social relations to collapse. In this respect, New Confucianism fails to recognize how traditional social institutions can help transform individuals into sages. Secondly, it excessively emphasizes the abstract metaphysical concepts. This makes New Confucians blind to practical social and political reality. Thirdly, New Confucians believe that through individuals‚Äô self-cultivation of virtue, external social and political problems will be solved. Because of this, they do not comprehend the critical role of ritual and legal systems in alleviating sociopolitical problems. Finally, under the assumption that the human mind exists outside of space and time New Confucianism resorts to transcendentalism. This lack of attention to history causes New Confucians to be unaware of the sociopolitical reality. Moreover, it betrays the Confucian spirit, for Confucius held that human beings exist at a point in historical and social reality; it is vital that they be defined by socio-political relationships according to the rites. Among other things, the fact that New Confucians predominantly draw on Mind Confucianism has made them oblivious to the values of Political Confucianism, a strand in which Jiang uses as the basis for his alternative solution. Moreover, Jiang believes New Confucians have inappropriately blended Western ideas of science and liberal democracy that are neither compatible with Confucianism, nor the Chinese society.Wang, Ruichang, \\"The Rise of Political Confucianism in Contemporary China.\\", The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China, edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, Political Confucianism and Rejection of Western idea of ‚ÄòEquality‚Äô Political Confucianism, as opposed to Mind Confucianism, concerns society and social relations. As it comes from the Han dynasty text Gongyang Zhuan, it reflects a version of Confucianism concerned with politics and governing. Also, whereas Mind Confucianism assumes that humans are innately good, Political Confucianism more cautiously employs institutional systems to condemn bad human behaviors and immoral politics, thereby nurturing individuals to become principled beings. Moreover, it pays attention to historical lessons and strives to find a rightful form of governance, as illustrated by the idea of wangdao. In deriving his solution, Jiang is hugely influenced by this concept. Moreover, Jiang rejects the Western concept of ‚Äúequality,‚Äù an idea that propagates liberal democracy. From the Confucian point of view, people are unequal‚Äîas they differ in virtue, intelligence, knowledge, ability, etc. Hence, it is not plausible to give everyone equal rights without considering their standings. Also, while every individual should be bounded by the law, this does not mean that everyone should have equal legal rights or obligations.Ruiping Fan, \\"Jiang Qing on Equality\\", The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China, edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, Way of the Humane Authority The Way of the Humane Authority as justification of political power is based on Confucian principles outlined in the Gongyang Zhuan, one the Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals: the legitimacy of heaven (a sacred, transcendent sense of natural morality), the legitimacy of earth (wisdom from history and culture), and the legitimacy of the human (political obedience through popular will). =The Trilateral Parliament as the solution= Jiang has proposed a trilateral parliament system for China, which would consist of three houses, each representing the three kinds of legitimacy discussed in Criticism of New Confucianism. ‚ÄúThe three are the House of Exemplary Persons (Tongru Yuan), also called the House of Ru or the House of Confucian Tradition, which represents sacred legitimacy; the House of the People (Shumin Yuan), which represents popular legitimacy; and the House of the Nation (Guoti Yuan), which represents cultural legitimacy.‚Äù The Confucian scholars in the House of Exemplary Persons are elected by recommendations and nominations. Representatives from Daoism, Buddhism, Islam, or even Christianity are also present in the House. The members in the House of People are elected by universal suffrage. The members in the House of Nation are chosen by hereditary criteria and by assignment. Each house possesses real parliamentary power, and the bill must be accepted by at least two house, in order for it to become a law. In a way, this produces a system of checks and balances to guarantee that the best decision is reached, and that no party is overly dominant. All in all, the constitutional framework is supposed to endorse the Way of the Humane Authority. It has more dimensions of political legitimacy than liberal democracy, where only the people's will is reflected in the consent of the government. Reception of Jiang‚Äôs ideology Jiang's work has triggered debates in the academic circle. Some scholars, for example Ruichang Wang, agree with Jiang's criticism of liberal democracy and his proposal of the trilateral parliament regime. They believe that in the future, the idea will gain more support. Daniel A. Bell , another supporter of Jiang, agrees that in order for a political transition to become successful in the long run, it must draw on the existing cultural resources, i.e. Political Confucianism, in China's case. Similar to Wang, he believes that Jiang's proposal of the trilateral parliament system is promising, but there needs to be some modification for it to become feasible and more effective. The will of the people should not be the only parameter considered when making decisions. Yet, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of the legitimacy from sacred sources or historical continuity.Daniel Bell, \\"Jiang Qing's Political Confucianism.\\", The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China, edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, Li Minghui wrote that while Jiang admittedly did significant work complicating New Confucianism by referencing political tradition, his conception of political Confucianism was theoretically and practically unsound. He accused Jiang of being overly concerned with the political and thus overlooking the mind and morality.

Along with On Contradiction, this essay is a part of lectures Mao gave in 1937. It expresses Mao's support for Marxism and attempts to establish a distinctly Chinese brand of communist philosophy.Philip Short, Mao, A Life (Great Britain: Hodder Headline, 1999), 355. At the time it was written, the Communist Party of China had just endured the Long March and their nationalist foes were still at large. Plus, China was facing a tremendous Japanese threat. Mao hoped to establish himself as the leader of China's communist party in order to unite China and vanquish the Japanese. On Practice was written as a part of this mission, for it gave Mao a more legitimate claim to lead by creating the basis for his communist philosophy, Maoism. Philosophical argument On Practice explains Mao Zedong's philosophy concerning the acquisition of knowledge. In this text, Mao follows in the footsteps of Marx and Lenin, endorsing the dialectical-materialist philosophy that knowledge is wrought through practice. Mao stresses the understanding of political and cultural life, in addition to the material focus of Marx. With the help of historical and other examples, Mao explains the dialectial-materialist process, breaking it down into comprehensible parts. The process begins with the acquisition of logical knowledge, which happens in three stages, perception, cognition, and conception. Once these steps finish, people must apply their logical knowledge to reality through practice in order to verify the truth-value of their conceptions. True knowledge is logical knowledge that, when practiced, successfully directs people to their desired end. According to Mao, other philosophies fail to recognize the importance of practice, and only through this dialectical-materialism can the Chinese people experience progress. According to Mao, logical knowledge results from the process of perceiving, cognizing, and conceptualizing.Mao Zedong, On Practice, On the Relation Between Knowledge and Practice, Between Knowing and Doing (1937). During the stage of perception individuals spend time interacting with the subject of their enquiry, and they merely absorb the impressions their senses are giving them. This stage allows people to become familiar with the matter they are interested in, for as they gather impressions individuals begin to recognize the essential elements of their subject. For instance, an individual observing trees comes to understand that trees do not always bear leaves. They realize birds use some trees as their home. Additionally, useful impressions can be derived from indirect experiences of a phenomenon. According to Mao, an indirect experience is just a direct experience of some other person's impressions. Therefore, indirect impressions still gather genuine information about a subject. Impressions eventually lead to the second step toward rational knowledge, cognition. At this point, individuals establish some general notions about their subject using the essential aspects that were impressed upon them. From there individuals begin conceptualizing; they use their reason to make judgments with the general notions their impressions supplied. These judgments are pieces of logical knowledge. They can be as mundane as judging that many trees lose their leaves during the winter, and as significant as Mao's example, the Communist Party of China can defeat their Japanese opposition. All logical knowledge must be put to practice in order to substantiate its truth-value. Logical knowledge requires this testing because of its circumstantial founding. Impressions, the origin of logical knowledge, are based upon the circumstances someone experiences. Circumstances change. Therefore, logical knowledge is subject to error. However, by putting their logically founded judgments into practice an individual can address the errors in their ideas. Practice does this by presenting individuals with new impressions, for practice involves interacting with the phenomenon being examined. These new impressions are used in the same way the older ones were. They inform judgments. The only difference is that these judgments are about the truth-value of the original logical knowledge. True knowledge leads to the successful completion of an objective, and is derived from the continual amendment of logical knowledge. A piece of logical knowledge usually undergoes many changes before it can be called true knowledge, for the circumstances surrounding a certain objective can always change. These changes conjure new impressions that disprove older judgments. For instance, a married couple will have to adjust their plan to buy a house according to the strength of the housing market. The fiscal requirements for buying the house will change with the market, so the couple's plan will have to adhere to those changes. However, once the couple understands the fiscal requirements and their financial means are able, they can buy the house. In the same way all logical knowledge can become true knowledge. Said simply, for this to happen an individual must cognize the correct circumstances. This reliance on circumstances is exactly why practice is such an essential element of knowledge, for through practice an individual's ideas are constantly accounting for more circumstances while testing the assumptions of prior knowledge. Therefore, they can eventually encounter the circumstances that can catalyze true knowledge. According to Mao, rationalists and empiricists do not follow the real path to knowledge, and he challenges these dissenters inability to recognize the proper use of practice. Rationalists do not recognize that interacting with reality is essential to understanding it. Without sensory impressions and tests how can you be sure a theory corresponds to reality? A rationalist might say because the theory makes sense. However, it makes sense that a bird walking across the street prefers walking to flying. The only way to reveal the true reason for the creature walking, a broken wing, is by observing it. An empiricist understands the importance of observing phenomenon. Mao thinks, they know that practice is important, but they do not know what to do with the information they have gathered from practice. Therefore, they cannot extract the essence of their impressions and therefore, cannot make useful judgments. Dialectical-materialism combines the perception empiricists hold dear with the cognition rationalists rely on, and as a result is the proper philosophy for attaining knowledge. Knowledge that the Chinese and all the peoples of the world can use to progress communism.

Tone is the product of all influences on what can be heard by the listener, including the characteristics of the instrument itself, differences in playing technique (e.g. embouchure for woodwind and brass players, fretting technique or use of a slide in stringed instruments, or use of different mallets in percussion), and the physical space in which the instrument is played. In electric and electronic instruments, tone is also affected by the amplifiers, effects, and speakers used by the musician. In recorded music, tone is also influenced by the microphones, signal processors, and recording media used to record, mix, and master the final recording, as well as the listener's audio system.  Stringed instruments  The tone of a stringed instrument is influenced by factors related to construction and player technique. The instrument's shape, particularly of its resonant cavity, as well as the choice of tonewood for the body, neck, and fingerboard, are all major determinants of its tone. The material and age of the strings is also an important factor. Playing technique also influences tone, including subtle differences in the amount of pressure applied with the fretting hand, picking or bowing intensity, use of muting and/or drone techniques.  Amplified instruments  The sound of an amplified electric or electronic instrument is affected by each component of its signal chain, from the instrument to the speakers. At minimum, the signal path will consist of the instrument, a preamplifier, a power amplifier, and one or more speakers.

While many efficient algorithms were known in the static case, they proved hard to kinetize, so new static algorithms were developed to solve this problem.  2D case  = Approach 1 = The simplest kinetic approach for maintenance of the closest pair is to use variants of the Delaunay triangulations. Consider a hexagon and partition it into six equilateral triangles, and then create a Delaunay triangulation based on each equilateral triangle, as each one is a convex shape. The union of these six Delaunay triangulations, so called Equilateral Delaunay graph (EDG), is a supergraph for the nearest neighbor graph (NNG); the endpoints of the edge with minimum length in EDG gives the closest pair. It is straightforward to maintain Delaunay triangulations based on convex shapes. Given the EDG over time, by creating a kinetic tournament tree over the edges of the EDG, one can easily maintain the closest pair. This closest pair KDS is efficient, amortized responsive, and compact, but in general is not local. The following approach presents a local KDS for maintenance of the closest pair. = Approach 2 = right The second kinetic approach is based on the following observations. Divide and conquer If the space around a point is divided angularly into six \\"wedges\\", each wide, the closest point to is the closest of the closest points in each of the wedges. The rest of this article will focus on the \\"main\\" wedges (those bisected by the x-axis), and symmetrical arguments will apply to the other wedges after rotating the plane by . Matched points Points and are said to be \\"matched\\" if they are the closest points to each other. Clearly, the closest pair of points is a matched pair. Consider points and , such that is to the left of and lies in the wedge centered at described above. If is the closest point to , then must be the closest point (in this wedge) to , in the x-direction. Thus, the set of pairs of closest points (within this wedge) in the x-direction is a superset of the set of pairs of closest points.  Construction  # Map each point p=(x, y) in the set P to a new point p' = (u, v) = (x+y, y-x), forming the set P' of transformed points. Note that for a point , the points in the \\"main\\" wedges have and coordinates either larger or smaller than in this new coordinate system. # Sort the points by x,u and v coordinates, and store them in kinetic sorted lists. # Construct a 2D range tree T on the points in P'. For every node w in the primary tree, let T(w) be the secondary tree associated with w. This range tree will be used to identify the points in the \\"main\\" wedge for a point . # For every node w in the primary tree, and every node e in T(w), calculate the pair (w, e) = (b, r), where b (or r) is defined to be the point with maximum (or minimum) x-coordinate in the left (or right) subtree of e. Let be the set of (w, e) for all pairs w, e in T. This is a superset of the set of pairs of closest points (within the main wedge). # Build a kinetic priority queue on the pairs in , with priorities determined by the distance (measured in the original co-ordinate system) between the points in the pair. # Repeat the above steps for the plane rotated , to get kinetic priority queues on and respectively. The closest pair of points in P corresponds to the minimum of the minimums obtained from the three priority queues above.  Maintenance  Certificate failures can occur in the priority queues and the sorted lists. Swaps in the ordering of the points will cause changes to T (which will take O() time), and may cause insertions/deletions in the priority queues. Note that the number of changes to the sets as defined above need not be a constant number. However, any pair that starts or stops being matched as a result of the ordering of p and q changing must contain p and/or q, and hence there are only a constant number of matched pairs that must be inserted into/deleted from the priority queues. It is ok to only update these matched pairs since, by definition, only matched pairs have a chance of being the closest pair.  Analysis  This KDS is: * Responsive: takes O() time to process an event * Local: since each point is present in a constant number of kinetic sorted lists and kinetic priority queues, locality follows from the locality of those structures * Compactness: compactness follows from the compactness of the kinetic sorted lists and kinetic priority queues * Efficient: every swap in the sorted lists causes a constant number of insertions and deletions in the kinetic priority queues. Assuming the motion of the points is pseudo-algebraic, there are a polynomial number of swaps, and hence a polynomial number of events are processed by this KDS, making it efficient This approach can be used to maintain the closest pair in higher dimensions.

He was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Bendigo from 1945 to 1955 when he was defeated at the state election, then regained the seat in 1958 until 1964. Galvin was born in the Sydney suburb of Woollahra, and was educated at Petersham Commercial School until his family moved to Melbourne, where he continued his education at Scotch College. He became involved in the trade union movement while apprenticed as a fitter and turner with the Victorian Railways in Bendigo, and served on the local Trades Hall councils and branches of the Australian Railways Union.Galvin, (Leslie) William, Re-member (Parliament of Victoria). In 1939, Galvin was elected to the Bendigo City Council, and was Mayor of Bendigo from 1944 to 1945. He then considered a tilt at federal politics, but was convinced by his friend, John Cain, to nominate for the 1945 Bendigo state by-election triggered by the death of Arthur Cook. Duly elected, Galvin was made President of the Board of Land and Works, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey and Minister for Water Supply in the Second Cain Ministry after Labor won the 1945 election. Following the defeat of the Cain government in 1947, Galvin was voted deputy leader of the Labor Party in Victoria.Fahey, Charles, 'Galvin, Leslie William (Bill) (1903‚Äì1966)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 10 May 2012. When Labor re-gained power in 1952, Galvin became Chief Secretary and Deputy Premier. He was acting Premier in 1953, while Cain attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. During the Australian Labor Party split of 1955, Galvin remained loyal to Cain and the traditional party, although his support wavered to Bill Barry when he heard that Cain preferred Ernie Shepherd to be deputy leader. At the 1955 election, Galvin was defeated in Bendigo by the Liberal and Country candidate, John Stanistreet, by just twelve votes. His defeat removed him from the running to lead the party, and Shepherd was elected leader when Cain died in 1957. Although Galvin regained Bendigo in 1958, he was once again denied the leadership when he was injured a car accident days before the leadership ballot, which saw Clive Stoneham voted leader. Galvin retired from parliament in 1964 due to ill health. He died two years later in Bendigo, suffering from cirrhosis.

N.O.V.A. 3 falls into the sci-fi action-adventure FPS genre. Gameloft also launched a free to play edition of N.O.V.A 3 which is known as N.O.V.A 3 :Freedom Edition. Unlike its predecessors, instead of being faithfully orientated towards Halo, N.O.V.A 3 is more orientated to games such as Killzone and Call of Duty. N.O.V.A 3 features Gameloft's multiplayer service Gameloft Live.  Campaign  Former N.O.V.A commander Kal Wardin receives a distress call from his AI, Yelena, from the long abandoned planet Earth. He crash lands on the city of old San Francisco and joins up with Sergeant Becker and his N.O.V.A squad to fight their way back to the N.O.V.A base, while also disabling a Signal Jammer. A wounded Volterite detonates a bomb which blasts him out of the building. After helping him stand up, Sergeant Becker and his team come to know of his acts of heroism in the events of N.O.V.A. 2. He then heads to the sensor arrays after repairing them and then continues onward to base. At the base, Kal finds out that the N.O.V.A has stolen the Judger's artifact. The artifact could transform Earth back into the habitable planet it once was. But the Judgers were not people to play with, and knowing this, Kal vows that after saving the Judger's artifact from the hands of the notorious Volterites, he would be resigning from N.O.V.A, and this time, permanently. He and Sergeant Becker ride a 4x4 to the artifact location. As instructed to, Becker gets on the gun of the 4x4 and covers the entrance. Kal manages to reach the artifact, but right next to it stands Prometheus, who forbids him to get the artifact. Prometheus explains he is the hand of the Judgers, and he will be returning the artifact to them. Prometheus then tells Kal that unsurprisingly, Becker was overpowered and killed by the swarm of Volterites at the entrance. He then explains that Kal will have to retrieve two more artifacts for the Judgers in order to stop them from \\"cleansing\\" the world, killing both humans and Volterites in the process. Prometheus also tells him that he will have to get to the Fyna galaxy and battle for the second artifact. The second artifact is hidden in an ancient Volterite ship, Therrius. Kal is teleported there by Prometheus, and gets the artifact, with the help of new Volterite ally Maz'Rah. In the process, Kal reactivates the ship as well, which would help Maz'Rah's Volterite rebels in their war against the Volterites who are hostile to humans, called the Dominion. Then, Kal heads to desert planet Boreas, where he works with his old friend Rufus to retrieve the third artifact. However, after fighting off the rebels on Boreas and an intense car chase, the Volterites escape with the artifact and take it to their home planet, Volteron, where they intend to convert the artifact into a weapon of mass destruction to use against the humans. Kal, Rufus and Yelena then head to Volteron to get the artifact, before the Judgers would intervene and wipe out all traces of humans and Volterites. After fighting through heavy resistance and braving harsh environments including the exploration of a Volterite Shrine, crossing a lava river and much more, they meet Maz'Rah again who leads Kal through some Volterite systems. After that, they head to a Volterite temple where the artifact is located. Upon reaching the temple, however, Yelena is killed by the temple guardian, a powerful creature called the Kar'Rak. Maz'Rah reveals he can and has been controlling it, telling Kal and Rufus that the Volterite Overseer has left him no choice but to kill them. After Kal and Rufus fight him off while evading the Kar'Rak, Maz'Rah realizes his betrayal and kills the Overseer in a brief fight, and gives Kal the final artifact before dying of the wounds the Overseer had inflicted upon him. Rufus and Kal then escape the temple's destruction with Prometheus, who teleports them out.  Reception  On Metacritic, the game has an average score of 83 out of 100 based on 21 reviews.

Rd. 510) is a primary county road in Marquette County, Michigan, that connects Negaunee Township with the community of Big Bay. The road runs through rural forests as a paved and dirt road in northern Marquette County. It crosses the Dead River near the Hoist and McClure dams and runs for before terminating at an intersection with CR 550 south of Big Bay. The road was originally part of the State Trunkline Highway System as M-35. In 1919, the highway was to run through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette County. A bridge was moved from rural Pennsylvania in 1921 to carry the road over the Dead River. The Huron Mountain Club opposed the highway, and with the aid of Henry Ford, the road's construction was stopped during the 1920s, leaving a gap in the routing through the mountains. In 1939, the state transferred control of M-35 to local authorities, and the Marquette County Road Commission (MCRC) designated it CR 510\\\\. Since that time, the bridge over the Dead River has survived a flood in 2003, and it was bypassed in 2010 by a new section of road with another bridge over the river. Route description Starting at an intersection with CR 502 (Midway Drive) in Negaunee Township, CR 510 runs northwesterly through the forest as paved road toward the Dead River. The road curves westward near the McClure Storage Basin, a reservoir formed by the McClure Dam on the river. CR 510 follows the course of the basin on cliffs above it and then turns northward to cross the river. The bridge crosses the river above the water on a bridge opened in late 2010. North of the river, the road turns westerly again to approach the northern shore of the Hoist Basin, which is another reservoir on the river. The roadway continues northwesterly as a dirt and gravel road through rural northern Marquette County. The landscape is all woods with some small lakes. The road meanders through the landscape, intersecting several secondary county roads and logging trails. In Powell Township, CR 510 intersects the eastern end of Co. Rd. AAA, the Triple A Road, which connects westerly across the county line on the Yellow Dog Plains. North of this intersection, the county road turns to the east at the intersection with Blind 35. About after this intersection, CR 510 terminates at its intersection with CR 550 south of Big Bay. History =Background= alt=A map of northern Marquette and Baraga counties in Michigan's Upper Peninsula showing US 41/M-28 running through the central part of the counties. M-35 extends north into the Huron Mountains region with the central segment marked as \\"Impassable\\". In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) designated a scenic shoreline trunkline to run north from Negaunee to Skanee and L'Anse by way of Big Bay. The highway would continue from the L'Anse and Baraga area to eventually end at Ontonagon at an intersection with M-64. Local Upper Peninsula historian Fred Rydholm summarized the routing planned in 1925 as extending \\"... in a northwesterly direction, across the Dead River, over the Panorama Hills, then west past the Elm Creek swamp, along the south side of Burnt Mountain, across the Cedar Creek, the Cliff Stream and out past Cliff Lake to Skanee and L'Anse\\". This highway was designated as an extension of M-35, which ended in downtown Negaunee. Work was completed on a significant portion of the route in Marquette County by 1926. M-35 was routed east along M-15 toward Marquette before turning north-northwesterly toward Big Bay. This section of roadway follows the modern CR 510 in Marquette County. Similar work was completed in Baraga County connecting L'Anse and Skanee by 1932. Construction on the two ends left the center portion through the Huron Mountains unfinished and shown on state maps as a dashed line marked \\"impassable\\". The section not included in CR 510, with guard rails and cement culverts has been called \\"Blind 35\\" since. alt=Historic photo of the Steel Bridge over the Dead River One of the first tasks for the MSHD was bridging the Dead River in Negaunee Township, north of US 41. The state solved the problem by buying a bridge in Pennsylvania, where bridges of this design were more common. MDOT describes the bridge as: The structure has been known as the Steel Bridge to local residents since it was reassembled over the Dead River. =Henry Ford= Records of the Huron Mountain Club, an exclusive private organization with large land holdings in northern Michigan, show that Henry Ford visited the Upper Peninsula many times, including at least once with Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison on Ford's yacht, Sialia. Many of these trips involved research to keep his operations supplied. His UP land provided wood for the manufacture of Ford automobiles such as the Model T, which required of lumber per car. Ford, who was considering becoming the \\"owner‚Äìproducer‚Äìhandler\\" of the resources he needed, invested in sawmills in Alberta and Kingsford. He also bought the entire town of Pequaming, along the shores of the Keweenaw Bay. The town belonged to Dan Hebard, who also sold Ford a sawmill, tugboats, a 14-room bungalow, and land near the Huron Mountain Club. Hebard retired to spend his summers at a cabin on the Pine River on land belonging to the Club. Ford built a hydroelectric dam along the Menominee River to supply power to the Kingsford mill, bought the Imperial Mine, and opened the Blueberry Mine near Ishpeming to supply iron ore. The Ford Railroad was constructed between L'Anse and the Cliff River for his logging operations on of timberland purchased in 1922. He often visited the Upper Peninsula on business, but as early as 1917, the year he ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate, he sought entry into the Huron Mountain Club. Since the club limited its membership, Ford worked to improve his chances. His admission would ultimately come when M-35 construction was halted in the Huron Mountains. Hunters, campers, hikers, fishermen and some landowners opposed highway construction near the Huron Mountains. Rydholm said, \\"... there seemed to be no groundswell of sentiment in favor of it, but it looked as the though the die was cast and nothing could be done to stop it\\". The Huron Mountain Club members opposed the highway because it would open vast reaches of the back country and might harm the wilderness. Highway construction would also open the possibility of a resort hotel. William C. Weber, a real estate developer from Detroit, owned property along Mountain Lake, in northern Marquette County. A Michigan attorney general's opinion provided a way for blocking the road if two-thirds of the property over which the road would pass was owned by people opposed to the project. The proposed highway was to cross two parcels of Huron Mountain Club property, but that was not enough to halt construction. In 1926, Hebard was elected the new president at the Huron Mountain Club and changed its rules for admission. Before the changes, all existing members voted on new admissions, and four \\"no\\" votes meant rejection. After Hebard's changes, only club directors could vote, and only one \\"no\\" was needed to block election. In 1927, the road grading for M-35 had reached the Salmon Trout River. That same year, Ford bought more land near Mountain Lake. This property encompassed more than the requisite two-thirds necessary to stop construction of the road. In 1928, the road was moved to connect with the Big Bay Road (CR 550), leaving the stub of \\"Blind 35\\" behind. According to club records, \\"by 1929, M-35 was dead in its tracks and Henry Ford was a member\\". To commemorate his membership, Ford built a white pine log cabin on club property that cost between $80,000 and $100,000 in 1929 (equivalent to $ to $ in ). =After Ford= In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse was officially canceled as a state trunkline highway. Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming CR 510 in Marquette County. The Steel Bridge is still in place over the Dead River and previously carried CR 510 as the successor to M-35 in northern Marquette County. It survived a May 15, 2003, flood caused by the breaching of the Silver Lake Dam. The Marquette County Road Commission had announced plans in 2006 to bypass the structure with a modern replacement, leaving the existing bridge as a footpath or bike path. Construction on the bypass road and replacement bridge began in October 2007. The concrete work for the replacement span was started in late 2009, with an original projected completion date of November 1, 2010. The new crossing is above river level compared to the for the 1921 span. The total budget for bridge construction was $4.5 million and an additional $1.7 million for the approach work, with an 80-percent federal, 15-percent state and 5-percent county funding split. The new bridge opened to traffic in September 2010, diverting traffic from the Steel Bridge. Completion of the new span came after about a decade of planning.

Art of Lekim Ibragimov The style of Lekim Ibragimov combines painting, drawing and calligraphy. His works are a harmonious blend of Eastern and Western cultural heritage of modernism and poetic symbolism, traditional schools of classicism and abstractionism and surrealism. Lekim Ibragimov is known for drawing an image of an angel or several angels on each of his paintings. Paintings of Lekim Ibragimov are exhibited at the State Museum of Oriental Art (Moscow, Russia), State Museum of Arts of Uzbekistan (Tashkent, Uzbekistan), the Museum of East Asia (Budapest, Hungary), Novosibirsk State Art Museum (Russia), State Museum of Art of Kasteev (Almaty, Kazakhstan), Gallery of the Taufkirchen city administration (Germany).

One thousand angels and one painting In 2000 Lekim Ibragimov had an idea to create a painting based on the legendary \\"One Thousand and One Nights\\" oriental fairy tales. During 10 years he has been thinking of a concept for this art project, the implementation of which Lekim Ibragimov began in 2010. He finished his mega canvas in the spring of 2012. The project is called \\"One thousand angels and one painting\\". The name accurately reflects the projects essence, because it is a mega-canvas of 500 square meters area (8 feet high and 66 meters long), consisting of thousands individual canvases. Each painting is a complete story, depicting an angel. At a first glance you might think that it is a mosaic. However, it is not true, as a whole painting is not composed of separate unfinished pieces. There is a metamorphosis, when all the individual and independent units are combined to form a new and completely unique painting.

The Whale Caller first appears to be sexually attracted to whales; especially a whale he named Sharisha. As the story progresses, he meets a woman named Saluni, who falls deeply in love with the Whale Caller. Throughout the story, the Whale Caller constantly has internal conflicts. He tries to love Saluni, however he can not abandon the love he has toward his beloved whale, Sharisa. Plot The Whale Caller begins with an introduction to the central core of the story by describing the Whale Caller's ritual of blowing a special kelp horn to attract a whale he named Sharisha, a southern right whale. He longs for the whale's presence, but it is nowhere in sight so he ventures to Mr. Yodd to express his pain. He confesses his love for Sharisha and adds in that he bought a tuxedo for the sole purpose of welcoming her back. After leaving Mr. Yodd's grotto, the Whale Caller trips and injures his left knee. He explains that he sacrificed his knees in order to protect the special horn he was holding. Next, he opens up to his past by describing the origin of his ways beginning forty years earlier. His fascination with the kelp horn blown in church inspired him to learn to play it and eventually become the official horn player. Afterward, he becomes Chief Horn Player in a new church created that put heavy emphasis on using the kelp horn in service. During a baptism conducted near the ocean, the Whale Caller learns that the kelp horn affects the behavior of a whale. This urges the Whale Caller to believe he is communicating with the whale through his horn and becomes his obsession. He describes where he lived after leaving the church in his home village in South Africa, and how things there have changed over the years. Population growth in addition to the vast increase in tourism turn the Whale Caller into an outcast. He despises the mobs of tourists who have no comparable knowledge to his about whales he wades through on a daily basis but notices one particular woman who seems to be everywhere he goes, and who always seems to be watching him. It takes a while for the Whale Caller to speak to this woman but eventually he approaches Saluni, known as the village drunk, and has an uneventful conversation ending with her walking away. They meet a couple weeks later and pick up where the previous conversation leaves off by discussing whales and learning of their opposing views. The Whale Caller puts fourth his knowledge of whales for Saluni to interpret, but the outcome is the same as Saluni simply walks away. Saluni realizes her attraction to the Whale Caller and ventures to his Wendy House in response to his offer to cure her lice problem. She stays with the intention of never leaving and quits drinking in attempt to show her affection. Above her affection is her disapproval of the Whale Caller's obsession with Sarisha. When she vocally bashes Sarisha to the Whale Caller, the Whale Caller leaves to be with Sarisha though this trek to be with Sarisha was different. The Whale Caller displayed his affection for Sarisha by getting sexually aroused with an audience and ending with Saluni showing up. The Whale Caller's relationship with Saluni continues to grow as she attempts to initiate him into a more civilized living style. The whales migrated over a month ago and Saluni feels like her life is fulfilled as she has the Whale Caller and the Bored Twins. She even tries to initiate sex with him but his mind becomes filled with images of whales, including Sharisha and he is unable to follow through. The Whale Caller brings Saluni to Mr. Yodd and one day Saluni even goes there by herself in order to better understand the Whale Caller. One day they meet Lunga Tubu who has the voice of the Earth. One day, during a thunderstorm, Saluni and the Whale Caller finally consummate their relationship. Afterwards Saluni jokes that he could not have done that with Sharisha to which he replies 'You do not know that...'(97). As time goes on, Saluni and the Whale Caller continue to live together and Saluni rarely visits the Bored Twins anymore. But one day she goes to visit them and cures one of them of the flu. The Whale Caller finds that he does not know what to do on his own anymore and so the next day he goes to the Bored Twins home and finds Saluni to bring home. One day they attempt to go eat at a restaurant but end up getting in a fight. For the next couple of days, the Whale Caller pampers her constantly. Saluni goes to visit Mr. Yodd and is told that Sharisha will be returning soon. A couple of days Saluni spots the first whale and rushes home to realize that the Whale Caller already knows that the whales are returning. She proceeds to follow him for three days to make sure he doesn't go to the whales but then goes to visit the Twins. After a while she returns home to the house to find it locked and then rushes to the beach where she finds the Whale Caller in his tuxedo and with his horn. While there, the Whale Caller notices that Sharisha has been wounded by a boat. A new season begins and the whales return. The Whale Caller still spends his time watching Sharisha and her calf while Saluni attempts to catch his attention. Later Saluni comes up with a plan to have the Bored Twins use their beautiful singing voices for a radio station. The twins are excited but their parents are not and quickly shut the idea down again saying the machines will steal the children's voices. During the night a blue moon occurs. The Whale Caller compares himself to it saying he misses Saluni. As he watches Sarisha and her calf Saluni arrives and approaches him. They talk again and the Whale Caller tells her the story of the origins of the whale's blow holes. The next day Saluni is again determined to record the twins voices. She sneaks the Bored Twins to town. In the town they begin to sing and as they sing people begin to surround them and follow them. As they reach the studio the radioman is very impressed and sets an appointment for next week. She then returns to the Wendy house where the relationship she had with the Whale Caller is back. Some days not the Whale Caller forgoes watching the whales and instead fishes with Saluni. During one of these fishing days the Whale Caller lands a monstrous ‚Äúkabeljou‚Äù. Saluni uses it to make money charging people to take a picture with it. Soon they make a business of it, catching fish and charging tourists or others to take a picture with it. It is the day of an eclipse and Saluni and the Whale Caller fight because he wants to visit the whales. During the eclipse Saluni, upset at the Whale Caller's obsession, looks directly at the eclipse and goes blind. Now that Saluni is blind the Whale Caller feels guilty and tells her that he will follow her and guide her. Saluni decides to leave town and they travel along the coastline. They meet up with a tiny poacher and continue on their way. After walking for many days they reach the Breede River and after that Swellendam. The book skips and a freak wave hits Hermanus causing massive damage. After it is safe the Whale Caller returns to his house and begins to clean up the damage that has been done. Saluni also soon arrives. The two still have not talked and it is revealed that the Whale Caller called her ugly. The book then tells how Saluni got her sight back. She gets mad because the Whale Caller has lied to her about keeping the candle. She then accuses him of lying about other things and they walk the road silently. Saluni then accuses him of not caring and that is when he calls her ugly. After cleaning the house the Whale Caller goes and plays his horn out on the beach and plays it. He notices that Sharisha has been stranded on the beach. An emergency team comes and attempts to push Sharisha back into the water as the Whale Caller helplessly watches. As the Whale Caller watches Sharisha, Saluni watches him. As she watches the attempts to push her back in the water are in vain. Finally the scientists decide to kill the whale. After the whale is killed Saluni is filled with remorse. She feels guilty for Sharisha's death and the Whale Callers pain and sorrow. She drowns her sorrows in alcohol and goes to visit the Bored Twins. One of the twins hurls a rock at her to keep her from running. It strikes the back of her head killing her. Later the Whale Caller returns to the place of the beaching. He visits Mr. Yod to discover he can no longer hear its voice. The book ends as he names himself the Hermanus Penitent. Character analysis Whale Caller and Sharisha: As the protagonists of the novel, the Whale Caller is characterized as somewhat of a loner who awaits the return of the whale, Sharisha. For a few years now, the Whale Caller has developed an unexpected relationship with Sharisha, as he is in love with a whale. The Whale Caller is able to express his love for Sharisha by playing his kelp horn, which causes Sharisha to swim around the shoreline, making the Whale Caller content. The Whale Caller is aroused by Sharisha's reaction to the kelp horn, and considers Sharisha to be an intimate partner. This strains his relationship with Saluni who struggles to create intimacy with the Whale Caller since he is preoccupied with Sharisha. Ultimately though, the Whale Caller remains faithful to Sharisha and appeasing Saluni, until their deaths at the end of the novel. Saluni: Classified as the ‚Äòvillage drunk,‚Äô Saluni always seems to lurk around town seeking the Whale Caller's attention. She constantly references the fact that she is a ‚Äòlove child‚Äô and therefore deserves the affection and admiration she was denied of as a child. Saluni however is forced to compete for the Whale Caller's love with the whale, Sharisha. Saluni is able to create intimate moments with the Whale Caller, and in an attempt to fully capture the Whale Caller's heart, she constantly confronts Sharisha, asking the whale to die or leave the Whale Caller. While never successful, she seeks affection from the Bored Twins on her semi-regular visits to their home. At the end of the novel though, Saluni is tragically murdered by the Bored Twins, whom she had tended to throughout the novel. Bored Twins: Feral twins who are the daughters of two farm laborers‚Äô. Given their mental state, Saluni visits them during the day while their parents are in the fields. The Bored Twins have beautiful singing voices, which comfort Saluni during her times of depression. Saluni tries to record the twins‚Äô voices for a recording company, but their mother is afraid that their voices will be stolen, forcing the twins to distance themselves from Saluni. At the end of the novel, as Saluni is leaving the twins‚Äô house, they try to stop her by throwing rocks at her head, but they take it too far and accidentally kill her. Mda foreshadows Saluni's death earlier in the novel when the twins would torture frogs and snakes, preparing the reader for the psychopathology of the murder. Mr. Yodd: Dwells in a grotto with rock rabbits. Throughout the novel, the Whale Caller and Saluni turn to Mr. Yodd for confession. The Whale Caller confesses his love for Sharisha, and his concern that she might not return from her migration, while Saluni expresses her want to dispose of Sharisha in order to capture the Whale Caller's love. During confessions, Mr. Yodd taunts the Whale Caller and Saluni by occasionally laughing, causing discomfort and self-mortification for both the Whale Caller and Saluni. Themes Complexities of love for nature ‚Äì Throughout the novel, the Whale Caller is infatuated with a southern right whale that he has named Sharisha. This is a complicated relationship because when one loves nature (something such a forest) one does not think that it can love us back, but in this case, Sharisha seems to respond to the Whale Caller's affection. Mda makes the reader think about how the relationship with nature changes as we think of nature as being able to love us back; this complication affects the Whale Caller's relationship with Saluni. For example, when the Whale Caller and Saluni are about to consummate their relationship, ‚Äú‚Ä¶images of whales interfere at that moment of excitement and he goes limp‚Äù (74). This means that the Whale Caller is constantly thinking of Sharisha, even during his most intimate moments with Saluni. The Whale Caller also longs for Sharisha when she is away on migration. This love for Sharisha symbolizes the love normally only shared between two people. Jealousy ‚Äì The theme of jealousy is a prominent one in throughout the novel. The jealousy is mainly coming from Saluni and she is showing that jealousy towards Sharisha because Sharisha seems to get most of The Whale Caller's attention. Saluni mentions the love triangle between The Whale Caller, Saluni, and Sharisha; Saluni does not want this triangle to exist. Saluni says ‚ÄúI can tell you I am not going to be part of any triangle. The fish must go!‚Äù (81). Saluni constantly tries to get the Whale Caller farther and farther away from Sharisha. For example, when they start their journey, Saluni wants them to take the side roads, that are away from the ocean, so that The Whale Caller does not think about Sharisha. Betrayal- Throughout the novel, there are references to betrayal among the major characters in the novel. Saluni always shows affection towards the Bored Twins and they do likewise, but there are times when they don't. Ultimately, the Bored Twins betray her, which leads to her tragic death. Saluni starts running to go back to The Whale Caller and the twins try to slow her down by throwing rocks at her. When they see that this works, they make a game out of it and they continue throwing stones at her until they realize that she is no longer moving nor breathing. Blind following ‚Äì Throughout the novel, there are times in which people blindly follow others, without knowing the final destination and without knowledge of the purpose of the journey. After being blinded by the sun, Saluni goes on an adventure with The Whale Caller, and she literally blindly follows him wherever he leads her. This blind following represents Saluni's thinking that her life is now pointless. She has lost her chance to be a Hollywood star and she believes that she has also lost The Whale Caller to Sharisha. During her journey, she made no progression and in the end, she returns the same person as she left. Hermanus Hermanus is the town where most of the story The Whale Caller takes place. It lies along the Walker Bay off the south coast of the Western Cape. Its fame comes from its great vantage points to watch southern right whales during the spring and winter. Hermanus holds an annual Whale Festival at the end of September. Hermanus has what is believed to be the world's only whale crier. His job is to blow his kelp horn to announce where whales have been spotted.

He was also a composer and musical arranger who is known for his band arrangements and original compositions. He spent his formative years and the first years of his career in the United Kingdom. He subsequently auditioned to join the Canadian Army as a musician, was accepted in the rank of sergeant, and immigrated to Canada in 1953. Biography He left school in 1935 at age 14 and, along with his older brother Douglas, joined a juvenile Band and toured Britain for several years. In 1939 he enlisted in the Welsh Guards Band despite Scottish heritage. In 1942 he won 1st prize for a Jazz Composition at the Professional \\"Jazz Jamboree\\" for his composition \\"October Mood\\" which he now confesses he rather dislikes. He came to prominence in 1949 when he co- founded, in conjunction with Cliff Adams, Dick James, and others, the vocal group the Stargazers, which quite quickly came to enjoy considerable commercial success. The group appeared on such BBC Radio programmes as Workers' Playtime, and its fans included Queen Elizabeth II. Milne not only sang but also contributed arrangements. He came from a family of musicians (his father played at one point in the orchestra of the Paris Opera) and he was himself a skilled viola player. For a time he played viola in the London Symphony Orchestra. Quoting from the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo 1967 LP jacket, \\"Captain R. E. J.

Venturing into more popular forms of music after winning first prize in a jazz-writing competition, he arranged during the 1940s for Britain's big bands - Stanley Black, Geraldo, George Melachrino - and was staff arranger for the Ted Heath Orchestra. Captain Milne also played trumpet in big bands, formed and sang in a vocal group and worked extensively in radio and television in Britain.\\" In Canada, he pursued for many years a military career, eventually becoming commissioned as a director of music and known as an arranger of music for band. His Aupr√®s de ma blonde continues to be played by many wind ensembles. On the side, he continued to arrange and perform popular music in a non-military context. After retiring from the Canadian Armed Forces with the rank of Captain he took up another career as a teacher of string instruments at Nepean High School in Ottawa. He died at age 92 in Ottawa, Ontario, on February 9, 2014. The high point of his military career was arguably the Tattoo that took place in 1967 to mark the centenary of the creation of Canada. He was in charge of the music for this event, which concluded with a performance of his Marche Vanier, a work dedicated to George Vanier, the Governor General who had died just months before.

It consists of 30 songs and over 17,000 verses. The Lahuta e Malc√≠s was heavily inspired by northern Albanian oral verse composed by the traditional cycle of epic songs and by the cycles of historical verse of the 18th century. It contains elements of Albanian mythology and south Slavic literary influences, indeed Fishta was under influence of Croatian Franciscan friars as a student in monasteries in Austria-Hungary. In the poem the struggle against the Ottoman Empire became secondary and as a central theme substituted with fighting Slavs (Serbs and Montenegrins), whom he saw as more harmful after the recent massacres and expulsions of Albanians by them. The work was banned in Communist Albania and Yugoslavia due to anti-Slavic rhetoric. The work was described as \\"chauvinist\\" and \\"anti-Slavic\\" in the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia (1950), while Fishta was called \\"a spy who called for a fight against Slavs\\". The English translation of The Highland Lute was published in 2005 by Canadian Albanologists Robert Elsie and Janice Mathie-Heck ().  Analysis  The Highland Lute has about 17,000 verses and has been called by many Albanian scholars as the Albanian \\"Iliad\\". The book does however lack a genuine central subject around events, circumstances, characters, and imaginations. If there is a \\"hero\\" in the book it is the Albanian people. The stories described create together an Albanian persona which would be the anonymous hero. The content also differs from Jerome's \\"Unfortunate Skanderbeg\\" and Naim Frash√´ris \\"History of Skanderbeg\\". In the Lahuta e Malcis, the destiny of Albania lies in the mythological symbol \\"Time of Albania\\", and according to Albanian folklore, around this time, tribes, banners, lands, clocks, houses and highland warriors, were all united for a cause. Together this creates a charming ensemble of characters, mythological or not, as they convey the message of survival of the Albanian and his nation, even though it is filled with tragedy. The unity of the work directly affects the craft, and the mythology, including fairies, dragons, lizards, and shadows. The poems have a time span of two generations, beginning in 1858 when Montenegro, driven by the Russian Pan-Slavism, seeks to invade Albanian territory. The poem ends when the Albanian independence is proclaimed and the London Conference has decided to split the territories in half awarding lands to Serbia and Montenegro. Fishta seeks to group some songs, according to the historical chronology of events resulting in several cycles of songs. The reader is temporarily detached from real historical events and then driven to fantastic realms. The cycle begins with \\"Oso Kuka\\", continuing with the song of \\"Dervish Pasha\\", and the \\"Berlin Assembly\\". The last two songs create the atmosphere detrimental of Albanian national identity. The next cycle begins with the Albanian Prizren league and the only central character is Marko Miljanov, (described as Mark Milani in Albanian) who is the anatagonist in both Kosovar folklore and amongst the highlanders in Mal√´sia e Madhe. Alongside Miljanov, King Nicolas Petrovic hastily appears. The cycle is then structured into sub-cycles, and the first begins with Cun Mula, a tribal chieftain from the Hoti tribe. Following the exhibition of the song \\"Kulshedra\\" (dragon) comes the five-song sub-cycle that brings massive scenes. The following cycle is centered around Tringa before and after death. The events, after another thirty-year break, follows the uprisings of independence. The final song, \\"London Conference\\", is instead the epilogue of the poem. Various scholars have attempted to find clashes between Homer's \\"Lahuta of the Highlands\\" and \\"The Iliad\\", especially in the atmosphere by the two poems. They have compared characters that have common traits, event scenes, etc. Their conclusion was that the Homeric poem, with the exception of the distant model on which the poet was based, shared the Balkan affiliation with the Fishtian poem. The main conflict in the poem, between the Albanians and the Slavs, between the two nations is justified as a natural conflict, of genesis, in the famous proverbial verse \\"we have lost friends\\". However, the poet calls for avoiding the inevitable fatality \\"God in heaven and on earth But always our brother and sister\\". However the events are extremely tense giving the Highland Lute the form of dramatically original epic from other nations epos with mostly story telling. There is a pathological hatred between the two sides, not only among humans, but also between the relevant mythological beings, between nature, natural phenomena, and so on. This makes it impossible for the spirit of either side to rest or to cease to fight. In the Highland Lute, the hatred between the enemy camps is the contagious plasma of the poem. It puts together the clusters of characters. The poem travels between fantasy and reality clustering both imaginary and real characters. Both sides have undisputed right to all territories, events, to fight, to make peace, etc. The heavenly reality is no more than the reality of every day life and no more terrestrial than imagined and fantasized in a mountainous, all-natural familiarity among the two groups. Albania's time establishes a completely human, almost parental, relationship with Ali Pasha of Gucia when the moment is played with the fate of the nation. The great fairy is the poet's life-long sister, giving him courage and the spirit to follow the development of events, such as poems and curses. Likewise, other clocks, by tribal names or other clans by mountain names. The typical familiarity of this nature is created in the guest song \\"Zana\\" known for its rare artistic values. The poet seeks to put the historical characters of the work in the binomial with the mythological characters. Usually, these are examples of each other. The features of one party are reflected in the other. The beauty and nobility of Tringa are reflected Visitor's Fairy and vice versa. At the end of the fighting, the alien remains captured in Tringa's tomb, taking revenge on his Albanian sister. Natures dualism is described as the two groups, or sides, fighting each other. The symbolic center of the development of events, as the opinion of scholars affirms, is Shkodra. However it does not fall into religionism. He, as Professor Egerem Cabej says, uses the unit of the tribe to give the unit of the nation. In the tribe are marked the traits of the nation and of the race. This givs the Highland Lute a national and universal dimension. The verse with which the poem was built is the quadruple of popular poetry of the historical epic of the north. Fishta manages to bring in this verse with dozens of characters, each of them completely individualized, with unique traits that cannot be removed from the reader's memory. He also individualizes dozens of battles, and scenes, painted with its own special colors to be distinguished from the myriad surrounding it. Fishta's dictionary, much of which has never been used in literary works, much less in poetry, with words of obscure meaning, archaisms, solecisms, and composite words, often constructed by him according to bovine sources, success in creating not only visual but also auditory images. The rhymes are some of the most essential phenomena of the poem expressing the poets video-emotional attitude. Rhymes are often overlapping, alternating or as a cross-over. The rhymes are also multilayered, depending on the place where small or large breaks are made in reading, where in syntactic terms the sentences or sentences end in sentences. Fishta uses in his own way repetitions at the beginning, middle or end of the verse, refrains, repetitions of full texts, quotations from folklore masterpieces, inverted word over, and so on. There are also rapid dialogues, philosophical sentiments, vows, prayers, wishes, curses, blasphemies, interruptions and rhetorical questions creating variety for the reader. The rhythm of expression of artistic expression of reading is strongly determined by the figuration. Hyperbole is the main tool of the epiphany, but a hyperbole both fantastic and realistic. Fantastic for magnifying feature size or feature effect, realistic for their concreteness. Characteristic is the comparison, especially the lengthy comparison, often complicated with some comparisons and more in its composition, which possesses whole song lyrics. Also, the metaphors are used with originality with multiple folklore subtitles. Unrepeatable in the poem is the use of euphemisms with artistic effects, sometimes caressing, worshiping, and praising, at times suing, harsh and macabre. Euphemism functions instead of the names of gods, mythological beings, but also of the main characters of the historical grouping. The epithet always has metaphorical loads, it participates in comparisons or hyperbole. Animation and personification, like dense prosopopoeia (personfication), are the most effective tools of Fishtian balance between the terrestrial reality, down to the most intimate and concrete terrestrial plane. Some of the poem's most perfect songs like \\"Kulshedra\\", \\"Sutjeska Bridge\\", \\"Guest Fairy\\" etc. are a staggering manifestation of all kinds of stylistic figures.

The 310-hectare area has become an important and unique place in the city, where several skyscrapers are being constructed. One of its sections, where the Industrial Park is now located, was known as the \\"Vertedero de Panam√° Viejo\\" because it is a piece of land created by an artificial deposit of material that was extracted to build the Panama Canal for years. This large tract of land was neglected, but recently it has become the Industrial Area (used for distribution centers and merchandise). The remaining sections were mangroves and jungle, where the most modern buildings in this city were constructed. To enable the land of mangroves, millions of tons of earth and rock were poured, mostly from a hill near the Villa Guadalupe area, which was removed completely.

The story has been popular since the era of Majapahit kingdom. The story is usually performed as kidung a poem sung or chanted in Javanese tembang. The Kidung Sri Tanjung are performed in the traditional Javanese ruwatan ceremony. The name Sri Tanjung was connected to the Tanjung flower (Mimusops elengi), a flower with a sweet fragrance.  Origin  Like many other Indonesian folklores, the author of this tale was unknown, however it is suggested that the story was originated from Banyuwangi, East Java, since it is connected to the legend about the origin of the name \\"Banyuwangi\\". The story originated from the early Majapahit period around the 13th century. The story of Sri Tanjung can be found on bas reliefs of Penataran, Bajang Ratu, Candi Surawana and Jabung temple.  Summary  Once upon a time there was a handsome and powerful ksatria (knight) named Raden Sidapaksa that was the descendant of Pandavas. The knight served under King Sulakrama, the ruler of Sindurejo kingdom. Sidapaksa was sent to search for a medicine to king's grandfather, the hermit Bhagawan Tamba Petra that lived secluded in his hermitage on the mountains. Here Sidapaksa met Sri Tanjung, a girl with extraordinary beauty. Sri Tanjung was not an ordinary girl, since her mother was a vidhyadari (apsara) who descended to earth and married a mortal man. Raden Sidapaksa fell in love and asked Sri Tanjung for her hand of marriage. The happy couple went home, back to the kingdom of Sindurejo to settle down. King Sulakrama secretly fell in love, smitten and infatuated by the beauty of Sri Tanjung. The king desired Sri Tanjung for himself and set an evil plot to separate the newly-wed couple. King Sulakrama ordered Sidapaksa to go to Svargaloka in order to send a message to gods. He is ordered to hand the gods a letter written: \\"The bearer of this letter will attack the Svargaloka\\". Sri Tanjung lent her magic sash to her husband, a family heirloom received from her father Raden Sudamala. The magic sash was an enchanted clothes belonging to her mother, the apsara, and enabled her to travel from earth to heaven. Sidapaksa arrived at Svargaloka, not knowing about the message in the unopened letter, he handed the letter to the gods. Of course the gods were furious and attacked the unsuspecting Sidapaksa. Sidapaksa pleaded for explanation and explained himself as the descendant of Pandava. The gods learned about the misunderstanding and freed Sidapaksa. As the compensation for their mistake, the gods bestowed Sidapaksa blessings of magic weapon. Meanwhile, on earth after Sidapaksa left for heaven, King Sulakrama led an advance on Sri Tanjung and tried to seduce her. Sri Tanjung refused the King's advance and tried to escape. However the king chased and forced Sri Tanjung, hold her and tried to rape her. Right on time Sidapaksa came home to find his wife held in king's arm. The evil king told a lie, accused Sri Tanjung as a lustful unfaithful woman that tried to seduce him. Sidapaksa fell into believing the king's lies and in jealousy tried to kill her. Sri Tanjung cried and swore for her innocence, she pleaded her husband to believe in her. In desperation she swore as god as her witness, that if she is truly innocence, her body will not spilled blood, but fragrance liquid instead. Blinded by anger and jealousy Sidapaksa fiercely stabbed Sri Tanjung with kris. Sri Tanjung fell and died, but the miracle happened; just like her word, her spilled blood was a sweet fragranced perfume, a testament of her innocence. Raden Sidapaksa realized his terrible mistake and fell into regret and despair. Meanwhile, the spirit of Sri Tanjung ascended to heaven and met the goddess Durga. After learning about injustice that happened upon Sri Tanjung, the great goddess revived Sri Tanjung and reunited her with her husband. The gods ordered Sidapaksa to take revenge and punish the evil deed of King Sulakrama. Sidapaksa succeeded in defeating and killing King Sulakrama in a battle. It was said that the fragrant water, the perfumed blood of Sri Tanjung became the origin of the name Banyuwangi, the capital of Blambangan kingdom which means \\"the fragrant water\\".

The school was founded as Novaliches High School in 1974 by the local homeowners association, and inaugurated as Lagro High School in 1978. Current enrollment is about six thousand students. History In the early 1970s, the GSIS La Mesa Homeowners Association (GLAMEHA) requested that a high school be established in the Lagro subdivision next to their elementary school. The city government and education bureau helped establish a high school annex out of two housing units of Lagro Block 59. On June 13, 1974, Novaliches High School opened with an enrollment of 87 students. Florencio Dumlao served as the principal. In August, the annex was transferred to share the Lagro Elementary School compound, with a new principal and three teachers. Its first graduation took place on March 1, 1976. In the 1977-78 year, the school had an enrollment of 774, and in June 1978, it expanded to a 1.3 hectare site with an annex building consisting of two stories and 18 classrooms. On September 1, 1978, the school was inaugurated as Lagro High School. A six-room building was added to the southern part of the campus. Other annex buildings were constructed or acquired, including Patayas annex in 1987, Fairview in 1993, and the SB Building in 2003. As the only high school in the Northern Metro Manila, Southern Bulacan, and Western Rizal region, the number of students attending Lagro High School has grown over the years. As of 2011, the school had an enrollment of about 6,000 students. Notable programs and extra-curriculars *The LHS Courier (Filipino: Lagro Pahatid), is published monthly.

Van Buren Street, Chicago, IL. The theater had at least 14 different names over the years, opening in 1896 as the Steinway Music Hall, and closing in the late 1960s as Capri Cinema. The building for a time in the early 1900s was the offices and nucleus of a group of famous Chicago architects that included a young Frank Lloyd Wright. These young architects, inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what would become known as the Prairie School. Building history Steinway Hall was an 11-story (then) skyscraper designed by Dwight H. Perkins and opened in 1896. The building was built by the piano makers Steinway & Sons and the theater was one of many Steinway Halls around the world designed to showcase company products. Beginning in the winter of 1896-97, the building's 11th floor housed the offices of a group of important architects that included Dwight H. Perkins, Robert C. Spencer, Frank Lloyd Wright and Myron Hunt. Wright would maintain an office there until ca. 1908.Wright had an office at Steinway Hall until 1908, according to The Lakeside City Directory of Chicago which shows the downtown offices which Wright leased year by year. This is verified in the secondary source: Grant Carpenter Manson, Frank Lloyd Wright, Volume 1, Reinhold, 1958. Page 215 See footnote #107 The building and offices became a central location for architects including Webster Tomlinson, Irving Pond and Allen Bartlitt Pond, Adamo Boari, Walter Burley Griffin and Birch Long. The building served as the nucleus of a group of architects known as The Eighteen, a name coined by Wright to signify a group who gathered for meals to discuss matters of mutual interest. Others outside Steinway Hall who met with the group included Arthur Dean and George Dean, Hugh Garden, Arthur Heun, Alfred Hoyt Granger, Richard E. Schmidt and Howard Shaw. Around 1925, the Chicago Musical College moved into the building.From written by Don Draganski, edited by Brian Wis. One hundred and twenty-five names appeared on the faculty roster for that year, and the School opened three dormitory floors for students. The College stayed there until 1954, when it merged with Roosevelt University's School of Music and moved operations to the Auditorium Building. Steinway Hall was demolished in 1970. In its place, and all up along Wabash, was built the CNA Center (originally Continental Center III), 1970-72. This 44-story slab, designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst & White, is prominent in Chicago's skyline not only because of its 600-foot height close to Michigan Avenue, but even more so because of its redness. Theater history Steinway Music Hall The 850-seat theater opened as the Steinway Music Hall. By 1900 the theater was renamed Ziegfeld Hall, probably leased to Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., but soon was renamed the Kelly and Leon Opera House. By 1910, it was called the Whitney Opera House, leased to B.C. Whitney. Sophie Tucker and Fatty Arbuckle were among those to appear in stage shows at the Whitney. By 1915, it was called the Central Music Hall with a program of Shakespearean plays. It should not be confused with a different Central Music Hall, designed by Dankmar Adler, that stood at the southeast corner of State and Randolph streets and was demolished in 1900. Central Music Hall was renamed to Central Theatre in 1923, with variations on that name over the next several years depending on who leased it (Minturn's Central Theatre, Barrett's Central Theatre, Shubert's Central Theatre). In 1930 it became a movie house called the Punch & Judy Theatre. In about 1931 it was renamed back to the Central Theatre and did live performances again, but in 1934 it went back to movies and was renamed the Sonotone Theatre. It was later renamed the Studio Theatre, the Ziegfeld Theatre, and finally the Capri Cinema in 1958. Capri Cinema ran adult films towards the end, closing in the late 60s. The theater was demolished with the building in 1970.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy The Alexander Murray had been Liberal MP for Midlothian a.k.a. Edinburghshire, since 1900. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Murray of Elibank, in the County of Selkirk. Previous result Candidates The Liberal candidate chosen to defend the seat was Alexander Shaw. He was a 29-year-old Barrister who had been educated in Edinburgh. The Unionists again selected John Hope who had fought the seat at the last election. He was a 43-year-old soldier. The Labour party, which had never before contested the seat, fielded Robert Brown. He was a local man, having been elected Provost of Dalkeith. He was also Secretary of the Scottish Miners Federation. When the vacancy became known, the Unionists quickly re- adopted Hope to enable them to immediately start the campaign. Arthur Henderson the Secretary of the national Labour party met the Scottish Miners Federation, where it was agreed that a Labour candidate would contest the seat. It was clear that this was likely to be Provost Brown. The Liberals were expected to adopt Shaw, however, the outgoing Liberal MP, the Master of Elibank, felt that the Liberal Association should not field a candidate but support Brown, who had strong Liberal sympathies, if he was the Labour candidate. Elibank's telegram to the Chairman of Midlothian Liberals, in which he outlined his views and praised the qualities of Brown, was made public.The Glasgow Herald 10 August 1912The First Labour Party 1906-1914 edited by K.D.Brown Elibank had just stepped down as Liberal Party Chief Whip, so was still close to Liberal Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith. However, the Midlothian Liberals decided to select Shaw and Brown was selected by Labour, so a three- way contest was assured. Campaign The constituency had returned Liberals at every election since 1874, however, with a Labour candidate in the field, the election was expected to be less than straightforward. Brown's Labour campaign joined with the Unionists in criticising David Lloyd George's National Insurance Act. Despite his past Liberal sympathies, Brown was to be found campaigning for the nationalisation of land and the nationalisation of mines. The Labour party campaign received the active support of the Scottish Federation of Women's Suffrage Societies.Workers Educational Association The Liberal party campaign received the backing of T.P.O'Connor and the United Irish League who urged the 600-700 Irish miners in the constituency to vote Liberal, due to the work the Liberal Government was doing on the Irish Home Rule Bill. Result Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the summer of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. Shaw was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Kilmarnock Burghs at a by-election in 1915, In 1918 when the constituency was split, Hope was elected as Unionist member for Midlothian North and Peebles.

Anh. 56/315f by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is an unfinished work that was written in Mannheim in 1778. It was written for an Academie des Amateurs that was to take place in Mannheim. Mozart himself was to play the piano part and Ignaz Fr√§nzl, the concertmaster of the Mannheim orchestra, was to play the solo violin part. Mozart only wrote the first 120 bars of the first movement, and only the first 74 bars are completely scored. Alfred Einstein believed that the work was abandoned due to the disbanding of the Mannheim orchestra; however, that had happened earlier that year when the Elector moved to Munich and most of his orchestra followed him, so the Academie des Amateurs replaced the Mannheim orchestra. The most likely explanation for the concerto being abandoned is that Mozart left Mannheim in December 1778, perhaps because the Academie did not start as early as he thought it would. It is unknown why he did not continue working on the concerto on his journey home or when he was back in Salzburg.K315f (Anh 56) Concerto for Violin and Piano.

Carlo Maciachini Born near Varese, he studied in Milan, where he also realized some of his most important works, most notably the Monumental Cemetery (1866). Other notable works of Maciachini are restorations of historic churches in several cities of northern Italy. Along with Camillo Boito, Luca Beltrami, and Luigi Broggi, Maciachini is one of the prominent representatives of the eclectic period of Milanese architecture, sometimes referred to as \\"Milanese eclecticism\\" (approx. 1860-1920). Maciachini e il restauro dei luoghi di culto a Milano Milano dall'eclettismo al futuro Biography Santa Maria del Carmine, Milan (1880) Maciachini was born in Induno Olona, in the Province of Varese (Lombardy), to a farmers family. As a young boy, he proved to be a talented wood carver, working as an apprentice in local woodworking shops. Giuseppe Merzario, I Maestri Comacini (1893), vol. II, pp. 157-158 At the age of 20, he moved to Milan to become an art student at the Brera Academy, where eventually graduated in architecture, at the same time earning a great popularity in the Milanese high society as a carver and decorator. His first major work as an architect was the realization of the Saint Spyridon Church in Trieste for the Serbian Orthodox community. A few years later he submitted his proposal for the design of the new Monumental Cemetery of Milan (\\"Cimitero Monumentale di Milano\\"), and was chosen by the city authorities for the task. The cemetery was completed in 1866, and is widely recognized as Maciachini's prominent achievement. Thereafter, Maciachini worked on a number of other designs (mostly restorations of decayed religious buildings) in Milan and other areas of Northern Italy, including several cities in Lombardy, Veneto, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. He would also sporadically return to sculpture and carving; for example, he realized the Corinthian capitals of the church of Bodio, as well as the pulpits of the Basilica of San Vittore in Varese. Maciachini was also involved in a resounding failure with his design of the dome of the Cathedral of Pavia, which was completed in 1885 and partially collapsed in that same year. The Cathedral had to remain closed for over seven years because pieces of marble would occasionally fall from the fractured dome. The dome is still in place, but its maintenance is difficult and costly because of the defective design. Maciachini died in Varese in 1899, and was buried in the Monumental Cemetery of Milan. To honour his contributions to the architecture of Milan, a large square of the city, Piazzale Carlo Maciachini, has been named after him. Style Geometric symbols on the facade of Santa Maria in Strada (Monza) Especially in the restoration of old buildings, Maciachini developed a personal and appreciated style, which was both scientific and eclectic. He would first try to identify the original structure of the buildings he was restoring through a study of any available documentation, to recreate them as faithfully as possible; but then, when precise documentation wasn't available, he would integrate the design, creatively borrowing features from other buildings of the same historical period and architectural style. A recurring theme in Maciachini's style is the extensive use of dense patterns of geometric shapes and symbols in the decoration of facades, rose windows, and other architectural elements. It has been noted that, despite working on religious buildings, Maciachini made very little use of Christian symbols: for example, the chapels in the Famedio (the core building of the Monumental Cemetery) did not include any Cross symbol in Maciachini's original design. On the other hand, stars of David, pentagrams, (left-facing) swastikas, triskelions, and other non-Christian symbols are found in many of Maciachini's facades and architectures. Il mistero della stella di Davide Carlo Maciacchini This predilection for \\"pagan\\" (possibly esoteric) symbols has aroused a number of theories alleging that Maciachini was an affiliate of some sort of secret organisation, such as a Freemasonry society.

It is one of the county's finest unimproved wet meadows. Though it is some distance from the River Severn the meadow may flood in winter.Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al, 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust' Plants A colourful variety of flowers may be seen throughout spring and summer. These include cuckoo flower, marsh-marigold, great burnet, meadowsweet, common knapweed, meadow vetchling, marsh ragwort, meadow buttercup, sorrel, ragged-robin, reed canary-grass, sweet vernal-grass and meadow brome. The wet conditions encourage many sedges including brown sedge, oval sedge, yellow sedge and carnation sedge. The slender spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis) grows in this meadow which is rare in Gloucestershire. Surroundings The meadow is surrounded by mature hawthorn and blackthorn hedge and includes old white willow pollards. This habitat supports many birds, including tawny owl and turtle dove. Conservation The meadow is traditionally managed by a late summer hay cut, which allows wildflowers to set their seeds. There is then cattle grazing.

Influences  Lev was influenced by the alternative theatre scene in London in the 1970s where she first came into contact with such troupes as the People Show and practitioners such as Charles Marowitz. In 1973 Gabriella Lev made Aliyah to Israel. Which had a great effect on her work. She participated in a 10-day workshop given by Andre Gregory and Jaques Chwat at Mishkenot Sha'ananim. This exposure to work inspired by Jerzy Grotowski influenced her artistically. Later she collaborated with Serge Quaknine a student of Grotowskis. Also in this period she first came into contact with the voice work of the Roy Hart Theatre and co-operated with members of the theatre particularly Barry Coglhan for many years. In her first year in the country she worked in various schools and community centers teaching drama.

They are compiled from numerous statistical sources (profit and loss accounts of social insurances, the Public Finance Statistics [EFS], the Swiss Social Insurance Statistics [SVS], etc.) and provide information on expenditures and their financing in the field of social security. On the expenditure side, the Total Social Security Accounts focus on social benefits and on the revenue side on employers' social security contributions, individual compulsory health insurance premiums, public funding and investment income. Figuratively speaking, the Total Social Security Accounts consist of a sub-structure and a superstructure, with the sub-structure comprising the absolute value of the revenues and expenditures and the superstructure the indicators into which the absolute values can be processed. The Total Social Security Accounts are internationally comparable, as they are based on the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROSEuropean System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics) developed by Eurostat. In 2007, total expenditure on social security in Switzerland rose to CHF 142.4 billion (2006: CHF 137.2 billion). Revenues in 2007 amounted to CHF 167.29 billion. Provisional data are currently available for the year 2008: Total expenditure amounted to CHF 143.6 billion and revenues to CHF 154.18 billion.FSO, Total Social Security Accounts: data, indicators, expenditures and revenues  Legal basis  The legal bases of the Total Social Security Accounts are the National Council's Postulate of the Committee for Social Security and Health of 17 February 1995 and Art 10, Para. 2 of the Federal Statistics Act of 9 October 1992.Federal Statistics Act of 9 October 1992 (BStatG) (German)  Type of survey  In Switzerland, the first attempts to arrive at an overall picture of the finances of social security go back to the 1970s and 1980s. A direct forerunner of today's synthetic statistic was the \\"Social Budget of Switzerland\\", which P. Gilliand and S. Rossini developed for the years 1990 and 1993 as part of the National Science Foundation's \\"Changing Ways of Life and Social Security\\" project. Methodologically, this work was based on the ESSPROS which was applicable at the time. In 1995, S. Greppi updated the \\"Social Budget of Switzerland\\". The following year, Eurostat published a new ESSPROS. As far as the comparability of the Swiss Total Social Security Accounts with the total social security accounts of EU countries is concerned, the FSO adopted the methodological guidelines of this new manual without making any changes. Benefits that are not taken account of in the ESSPROS concept are calculated and reported separately.  Features registered  Data on social security finances for the whole of Switzerland, broken down by institutions (old-age, disability insurance, etc.) are treated and expressed in CHF millions. For the time being, Total Social Security Account values can only be shown at national level. But available data also make it possible to show a large proportion of social benefits at the cantonal level. Most of the indicators developed on the basis of the Total Social Security Accounts also meet the criterion of international comparability. At present, international comparisons include most EU and EFTA countries.  Period conducted  The Total Social Security Accounts are compiled every year by the Federal Statistical Office. The 2003 edition provided for the first time information on almost all categories of the Total Security Accounts going back to the 1950s. However, the estimates for the decades between 1950 and 1990 are not as precise as those for the years since then.

The game derives its themes from Easter Island; the player controls a sentient moai statue that must rescue other moai and escape each stage via a door before the timer expires. Although platforming elements are present, the primary challenge is to find a way to manipulate the objects in each stage to reach the distressed moai and rescue them while still leaving an avenue of escape to the exit door. Gameplay Each stage is a single screen with a variety of platforms, enemies, and obstacles. The protagonist moai has limited jumping abilities, but may also smash certain blocks and enemies using a head-butt, or drop bombs found in certain stages to destroy blocks below him. Although some stages will test the player's platforming abilities by requiring careful jumps, most will instead require careful planning of each move via moving or destroying blocks, and not only its immediate consequences but the long-term effects as well. For example, a block pushed against another object can no longer be moved, which may ultimately prevent the final solution of the puzzle. Typically each stage has only a single solution (or several very similar solutions), and an incorrect move risks making the stage impossible to solve from that point forward. The player may reset the stage by pressing select at any time, though doing so costs the player one life. Successfully completing a stage awards the player one extra life. In addition to voluntarily resetting the stage, the player may lose a life by touching an enemy, falling into a pit, landing on hazards, being crushed by falling objects, or running out of time. The game features 56 unique stages, and allows the player to continue the game via use of a password. The graphics and themes are largely derived from Easter Island imagery, with many backgrounds taking cues from island landscapes and objects and enemies frequently resembling primitive stones or statues. Fantasy elements are present, with many stages taking place in the clouds and enemies using magic. Release and Reception Moai-kun was released in March 1990 in Japan for the Family Computer system. Although it never received a North American or PAL release, virtually all of the game's text is in English, with only the title screen graphic in Japanese. It received generally favorable reviews on release, with reviewers praising the brain-teaser variant on platforming.

He worked at the Library of Congress for 39 years and was chief of the Congressional Reading Room from 1937 to 1948. He served as librarian for many years at the Cosmos Club in Washington, D.C. Milne was born in Washington, D.C., to well-known interior decorator Alexander Milne (1847-1927) and Isabella Metcalf (1854-1922). He married Ella Baldwin Lower of Cleveland, Ohio, in 1917.\\"George H. Milne dies; Reading Room Chief at Library of Congress,\\" The Evening Star, Washington, D.C., Oct. 26, 1948 His bride's brother was a co-author, with Milne and J. Bentley Mulford, of a bibliography entitled The Dramatic Books and Plays Published During 1912-1916 and 1921. Milne worked as a messenger for The Evening Star newspaper from 1902 to 1905 and then was employed by the Philip T. Hall haberdashery firm from 1906 to 1909. He was hired as a messenger by the Library of Congress in November 1909, and served in the general reading room. In 1917, he was transferred to the congressional reading room and became chief there in 1937. As a boy, Milne would trek through the woodlands near Washington, D.C., in search of species of plants not generally known. In later life, it was said that Milne knew the names of all domestic flowers and plants and most wildflowers and could spot them at a glance. Rep. Daniel A. Reed of New York said that Milne, as a child, visited the White House on many occasions with his father and ‚Äúdeveloped a mutual friendship‚Äù with the children of President Theodore Roosevelt.\\"George Heron Milne: Well Done, Thou Good and Faithful Servant,\\" Congressional Record, Appendix A28, Jan. 5, 1949 Rep. Brooks Hays of Arkansas said, ‚ÄúThe number of Members he personally assisted in the 31 years of his service... must almost equal the number who have served in the Congress during that time. His quiet telephone voice has been known to virtually every member of Congress and certainly to every secretary on Capitol Hill. (From 1917) until one week before his death, George Milne, day and night, year in and year out, served the Congress with a devotion, a vigor and a technical skill which has seldom been equaled.‚Äù Late in Milne's career, the Director of Legislative Reference Services (now Congressional Research Service) wrote, \\"Mr. Milne is almost ideal as custodian of the congressional reading room.

Silambarasan was later impressed with Vijay Chander's script and approached producer S. S. Chakravarthy, who he was working with in Vettai Mannan, to fund the project. Hansika Motwani, Santhanam and VTV Ganesh were later picked to portrayal pivotal roles in the film. Thaman was signed to compose the film's music, while Shakthi was selected to be the film's cinematographer. Kannada actor Audithya was added to the cast to make his debut in Tamil films, after the producers were impressed with his performance in the Kannada film, Villain (2012). Aadukalam Naren and Sriranjini were selected to play Silambarasan's parents, with Naren portraying a railway employee. Actor Jai, who had simultaneously worked with Silambarasan on Vettai Mannan, was reported to have joined the cast to play a cameo role in August 2012. =Filming= Prior to the shoot, the makers chose to film a promotional teaser featuring Silambarasan, Hansika Motwani, Santhanam and VTV Ganesh. The cinematographer Shakthi and photographer Venket Ram were involved in the making of the teaser in Taramani during May 2012. The film's first teaser was subsequently released on 6 June 2012, with an initial release date of Diwali 2012 announced. On the same day, the team began their first schedule with Silambarasan and Hansika Motwani in Chennai, with large crowds of onlookers observing the team during a shoot in Triplicane. For a particular set of the lead character's home in the film, three different locations in Chennai were combined to show a single spot. A house near Pachaiyappa's College campus, Aachi house in T Nagar and a house in Royapettah were represented as a single building. The film's art director, Ilaiyaraaja also organised sets to be designed in Ayanavaram and Perambur, to depict a railway backdrop. A wedding scene of Hansika's friend was also then shot on the campus of Panimalar Engineering College during June 2012. The team moved to Mumbai to film scenes in August 2012, and the director and editor re-worked scenes as the shoot progressed. A second schedule began in Hyderabad later that month, with Silambarasan working on the film alongside his commitments to finish Podaa Podi (2012). As Podaa Podi had been in production since 2008, Silambarasan opted to prioritise finishing that venture and Vaalu was temporarily put on hold. In January 2013, director Vijay Chander revealed that only eight scenes and four songs were remaining to be shot, and that the delay of the film had meant that Vincent had replaced Shakthi as cinematographer. A few scenes were shot at Ramoji Film City in February 2013, but the production of the film encountered delays throughout 2013 as Hansika Motwani and Santhanam became busy with other film projects, and another schedule only re-began in July 2013 in Hyderabad. Action sequences involving Silambarasan were shot under the instructions of stunt choreographer Kanal Kannan. Ilaiyaraaja erected a set at Lingampalli Railway Station, Hyderabad to portray a bomb blast in the film, with the lead pair and Audithya involved in the shoot. In October 2013, Silambarasan was involved in the shoot of the opening song of the film in Binny Mills, Perambur. The shoot lasted four days and the song was choreographed by Sathish Krishnan, after which the team revealed \\"seventy- five\\" percent of the film was complete. The continuous delays of the films had arisen as a result of the practical problems of gathering all the artistes and had been hampered further by Chakravarthy's financial problems. During the period, Silambarasan had threatened to distance himself from the producer, after both of his films, Vaalu and Vettai Mannan had effectively become stuck. Sequences featuring Silambarasan and Santhanam were shot near the Accord Hotel in Chennai in February 2014, as remaining talkie portions were being completed. The team announced that another song was completed after a shoot in Bangalore, while the team travelled to Bangkok for a further song choreographed by Satish. Following the shoot, the director revealed that Vaalu was complete after two years of filming. Talking about the film's delays, actress Hansika cited that she had initially agreed to work on the film for sixty days, but had been forced to extend her call sheet by a further eighty days. She also revealed that the team often failed to keep up with schedules and had regularly wasted her dates, prompting her to prioritise other projects instead. The producer later revealed that the shoot of one song was pending, and that he intended to complete it, despite Silambarasan moving on to prioritise his work for another long-delayed project Idhu Namma Aalu (2015). Reports in November 2014 suggested that actresses from four different generations would feature in the song and that Sowcar Janaki, Saroja Devi, Kushboo, Meena, Simran and Nayantara were amongst those approached to be a part of the shoot. Delays and time constraints meant that the song was not shot and was left out of the film's final version. The team reconvened to shoot the song with Hansika instead in June 2015, scrapping earlier plans of including several actresses. Silambarasan continued dubbing work for the film in midnight sessions in November 2014, as the team aimed to release before the end of the year. =Litigation= In September 2012, the producers of Vaalu were involved in a legal tussle with the makers of another film who had claimed that they had registered the title first. Vijay Chander stated that he had registered the title in 2008, and thus held the rights to use the title. The other film was later christened as Rettai Vaalu and also had a delayed release in September 2014. Cinematographer Shakthi had also threatened legal action against the producers in January 2013 after leaving the project owing to its delays. He claimed that his name was not credited in the film's posters, despite having shot \\"seventy percent\\" of the film and lodged a complaint to the cinematographers' union. Delays had meant that along with Shakthi, seven other cinematographers had been utilised by the team to film scenes. Velraj, Vetri, Dinesh Krishnan, Rahul Dharuman, Vincent Arul, Sukumar and Gurudev were all involved in the making of the film. In July 2015, after the producers had announced a preliminary release date of 17 July, the Madras High Court issued an interim ban on the film. Film distribution company Magnum Rays had alleged that they had agreed a deal in principle with NIC Arts to distribute the film across Tamil Nadu in 2013, and that the intervention of T. Rajendar's Simbu Cine Arts thus bypassed the old agreement. The team subsequently managed to amicably sort out the issue.Madras HC stays Vaalu's release ‚Äì The Times of India. Timesofindia.indiatimes.com (8 July 2015). Retrieved on 19 August 2015. Soundtrack The music of Vaalu was composed by S. Thaman, with lyrics written by Silambarasan and Madhan Karky. A single track titled \\"Love Endravan\\" was released on 14 February 2013. Prior to official release, the film's songs were leaked online during March 2014. The song You're My Darling was remade into the song Ye Pilla Pilla for the 2015 Telugu movie, Pandaga Chesko, which also had music by Thaman. Release The film's first teaser, released in June 2012, announced that Vaalu would have a theatrical release during the Diwali season of 2012. However the impending release of Silambarasan's other long-delayed project Podaa Podi (2012) meant that the makers decided to postpone the release of the film until January 2013. The date was also missed and by July 2013, the producers indicated that the film may release on either 15 August or during the Vinayagar Chaturthi and Diwali season of 2013, though yet again, the film remained incomplete. In January 2014, the director had stated that the film would release on 1 May 2014, though portions remained incomplete owing to scheduling problems and the film was delayed further. Evading further release dates in November 2014, Silambarasan announced that the film would finally release during Christmas 2014 and promotions for the film began. However several other films had also secured screens for 25 December, and the makers were not willing to compromise for a limited release. After the film backed out of a Christmas 2014 release, a preliminary date of 3 February 2015 was set, to coincide with Silambarasan's birthday. The film had a private screening in early March 2015 for members of the cast and crew's family, and was given a \\"U\\" certificate from the censor board. The film experienced further delays and after a potential release date of 27 March had also been postponed to 1 May, Silambarasan made an emotional appeal calling for the quick release of the venture. The team then began promotions through posters for a release on 9 May, which was also later cancelled. Frustrated with the constant delays, Silambarasan's father T. Rajendar bought the distribution rights of the film from S. S. Chakravarthy and pledged to release it under his own Chimbu Cine Arts banner. In June 2015, Silambarasan announced a release date of 26 June 2015, delaying the film from 12 June.

Typically with a bank, the lender/mortgagee gives money to the borrower/mortgagor, who uses their property/land/home as security (essentially a reassurance) that they will repay the debt and any relevant interest. If the mortgagor fails to repay, then the mortgaged property which has been used as security may be subject to various mortgagee remedies allowing them to retrieve the debt. Mortgages are an important part of English land law and property law. These concern, first, the common law, statutory and regulatory rules to protect the mortgagor (i.e. the borrower) at the time of concluding the mortgage agreement. Second, English law defines and restricts the process for taking possession of property in the event of default. Third, it places duties on mortgagees (i.e. lenders, like banks) on the price it achieves when selling property. Although most of the law relating to mortgages relates to mortgages of land, it is possible to mortgage almost any type of property. Mortgages over personal property are often referred to as 'chattel mortgages', and mortgages over intangible rights are often expressed to operate by way of assignment. Separate statutory regimes also exist in relation to mortgages of ships under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and mortgages of aircraft and related parts under the Cape Town Convention. Technically the term \\"mortgage\\" refers to the security interest in the collateral, but in commercial parlance the term is often used inclusively as a reference to the entire secured lending arrangement. The law of mortgages is notoriously complex. In a 1986 working paper relating to land mortgages, the Law Commission commenced thus: > \\"The English law of land mortgages is notoriously difficult. It has never > been subjected to systematic statutory reform, and over centuries of gradual > evolution it has acquired a multi-layered structure that is historically > fascinating but inappropriately and sometimes unnecessarily complicated.\\" Slightly more pithily, Lord Macnaghten once commented in a judgment: \\"no one, I am sure, by the light of nature ever understood an English mortgage of real estate.\\"Samuel v Jarrah Timber and Wood Paving Corporation [1904] AC 323 at 326. History Like many aspects of English law, the law relating to mortgages is closely tied up with its historical development. Mortgages have existed in English law since the 12th century, but early English mortgages were largely shaped by usury laws. At the time charging interest was both against the law, and a sin. Accordingly, upon the grant of a mortgage, the mortgagee would into possession of the land - if the income arising from the land paid down the mortgage debt it was referred to as a live pledge (or vivum vaidum) but if the mortgagee simply took those proceeds and the debt was unchanged it was called a dead pledge (originally a mortuum vadium, which later was replaced by the Norman French, morte gage which eventually became mortgage). By the 1400s the form of mortgages had changed somewhat - mortgages were still created by transferring ownership of the land to the mortgagee, but the mortgagor remained in possession to work the land. However, on the stated day for redemption the mortgagor had to pay the full amount of the debt, otherwise they would lose their right to redeem and the land would belong to the mortgagee absolutely. This was doubly draconian as not only did the mortgagor lose their land, but the debt remained and still had to be repaid.Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat Ltd [1914] AC 25 at 35 However, as the law became less restrictive in relation to the charging of interest due to the passage of successive Usury Acts, and as society's attitudes changed, mortgages became more widely used, and the courts of Chancery became increasingly interested in protecting people from the severity of the common law rules relating to redemption. By developing a series of equitable doctrines the Courts of Chancery increasingly gave greater protection to mortgagees. They held that a mortgagee in possession had to account for all rents received on the property,Holman v Vaux (1616) Tot 133; Pell v Blewet (1630) Tot 133 and providing a degree of protection where the mortgagor was late in repaying the loan.Salt v Marquess of Northampton [1892] AC 1 at 19 In effect the Courts of Chancery \\"transformed mortgages from instruments of extortion to a convenient and flexible instrument of commerce.\\" Even though the effect of a mortgage was to transfer legal title to the mortgagee, the Courts of Chancery recognised that the mortgagor had a separate species of property right in equity, which came to be known as the \\"equity of redemption\\". Similar to this, a separate but confusingly similarly named right existed, which was the equitable right to redeem.Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat Ltd [1914] AC 25 at 48 In relation to land, the next great reforms were under the Law of Property Act 1925 which restricted mortgages to two types: a mortgage by demise (as to which, see below) and a mortgage by statutory charge. With the passage of time the mortgage by demise has become almost completely obsolete,Pursuant to the Land Registration Act 2002 it was no longer possible to create a mortgage by demise over registered land (although it could be created over unregistered land). By 2019 only 15% of land was unregistered: https://whoownsengland.org/2019/01/11/the-holes-in-the-map- englands-unregistered-land/. and today almost all mortgages of land in England and Wales are by way of statutory charge. Mortgages have also existed in relation to personal property (as opposed to land) for a considerable period of time, although for much of English legal history security over personal property was usually executed by way of pledge rather than by way of mortgage. However, by the Victorian era mortgages of personal property were sufficiently widespread that the legislature enacted the Bills of Sale Acts to try and regulate this area of the law. Mortgages of ships have been regulated by statute since at least 1894, and clearly existed for some time before that.Merchant Shipping Act 1894, section 31. Creation of a mortgage While real property may be divided among co-owners and tenants for the purpose of the land's use and enjoyment, taking a mortgage of property primarily serves the purpose of ensuring loans are repaid. Because of the nature of money lending, and frequently unequal bargaining power between banks and borrowers, the law gives significant legal protection to borrowers against the enforcement of unfair bargains. Along with pledges, liens and equitable charges, English law counts a mortgage as one of four main kinds of security interest, whereby a proprietary right that binds third parties is said to arise on conclusion of a contract. It must simply be the contract's intention to make property available to secure repayment. The Law of Property Act 1925 section 85 say that a mortgage requires a deed (under LPMPA 1989 section 1, a document that is signed, witnessed and states it is a deed). Under the Land Registration Act 2002 sections 23 and 27, a notice of a mortgage must be filed with HM Land Registry for the mortgage to be effective. Then, Law of Property Act 1925, section 87 says mortgages confer upon the mortgagee (i.e. the secured lender) the same rights as a 3000-year lease holder. Protection of borrowers =Equity of redemption= The reason for this reference to \\"3000 years\\" is that in a primitive protective measure, the common law said mortgage terms must always allow for the property to be redeemed in the end, when the debt is repaid. In the 18th century decision of Vernon v Bethell(1762) 28 ER 838 Lord Henley LC refused to enforce the conveyance of Vernon's sugar plantation in Antigua to a deceased London lender, Bethell, when Vernon had trouble repaying, even though some exchanges between the two had raised the possibility of giving up the land to satisfy the debt. Given the considerable interest paid already, Lord Henley LC held it would frustrate (or \\"clog\\") Vernon's right to redeem property. As he put it protection for the borrower was warranted because \\"necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men, but, to answer a present exigency, will submit to any terms that the crafty may impose upon them\\". Accordingly, the rule developed that \\"once a mortgage, always a mortgage\\",Seton v Slade (1802) 7 Ves 265, 273 meaning a mortgage cannot be turned into a conveyance of the property by the operation of terms in an agreement. It means that a lender may at most sell a property to realise its value, but may not take ownership, and the borrower must always practically be able to get back the property. The rule was suspended for companies by the Companies Act 2006 section 739, and was criticised in Jones v Morgan for being inappropriate in commerce,[2001] EWCA Civ 995 but it still survives as a rudimentary common law method to protecting vulnerable borrowers. =Defective consent= The most relevant protective measure at common law today is the right of borrowers to cancel mortgages if they were misrepresented about the mortgage's terms, or if they entered agreements because of under influence. In the leading case, Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2), a group of appeals all involved a husband allegedly pressuring his wife into signing a mortgage agreement with a bank, where security was over the family home.[2002] 2 AC 773 The House of Lords agreed that undue influence would make a contract voidable, and if a bank should have realised this possibility, it could not enforce the mortgage agreement against the spouse's share of the home. Accordingly, if banks wished to ensure valid mortgages they would need to have confirmation from an independent solicitor that the spouse fully understood the transaction. This ruling was intended to eliminate cases where people do not understand the consequences of mortgages. Alternatively, if despite independent advice, a spouse is still unduly influenced or is misrepresented the facts, he or she will have no recourse against a bank selling the home, but may have a claim against the solicitor for negligence. =Statutory market regulation= Beyond common law, there are three main kinds of statutory protection. First, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 codified a system of licensing for mortgage lenders. The Financial Conduct Authority maintains a Code of Practice and enforces compliance with the threat of license withdrawal. Second, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 empowers the Office of Fair Trading to engage in similar regulation of the second mortgage market. Third, the content of mortgage is regulated by ordinary consumer contract protection in the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. The general thrust of the law is to ensure complete transparency, and to cancel extortionate credit agreements, so that consumers know what they are getting, and do not get an unfair bargain. Lenders' rights Mortgagees/money lenders have multiple remedies and powers at their disposal if the mortgagor/borrower defaults on payments. There are five main remedies, including: # Right to Sue # Power of SaleLaw of Property Act 1925, s101(i) # Power of Foreclosure # Power of Possession # Power to Appoint a ReceiverLaw of Property Act 1925, s101(1)(iii) and s109 =Power of Sale= The power of sale is implied into the mortgage, therefore not requiring an express term to create the power.Law of Property Act 1925, s101 However, the power of sale only arises where \\"mortgage money has become due\\",Law of Property Act 1925, s101(1)(i) and it is exercisable as a result of one or more conditions specified in the Law of Property Act 1925, s103. When a mortgagee exercises their power of sale, there is a duty to act fairly towards the mortgagor.Palk v Mortgage Services Funding Plc [1993] Ch 330, at 337-338 This duty means the mortgagee must, amongst other things, > Take reasonable care to maximise his return from the property. He must also > take reasonable care of the property. Similarly if he sells the property: he > cannot sell hastily at a knock-down price sufficient to pay off his debt. > The mortgagor also has an interest in the property and is under a personal > liability for the shortfall. The mortgagee must keep that in mind. He must > exercise reasonable care to sell only at the proper market value.Palk and > Another v Mortgage Services Funding Plc [1993] Ch 330, at 338; another > useful case is Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd [1971] Ch 949, at > 966 Moreover, a higher duty of scrutiny will be imposed if a mortgagee sells to a related party. In Tse Kwong Lam v Wong Chit Sen[1983] 3 All ER 54 Mr Wong sold property taken from Mr Tse to his wife, after not advertising the auction. The Privy Council advised that while delay in the claim meant the sale should not be set aside, damages could be awarded because of the significant conflict of interest. Lord Templeman emphasised that \\"a heavy onus lies on the mortgagee to show that in all respects he acted fairly\\" so the transaction is perfectly fair and equal.See also York Buildings Co v MacKenzie (1795) 3 Paton 378 Section 88 confirms that a buyer after a sale receives an unencumbered title. =Power of Possession= The power of possession allows a mortgagee to take actual possession of the mortgaged property, and this may be for reasons including a desire to sell the property to retrieve the debt, or for the purpose of handling the property whilst it continues to produce an income. Possession is available the moment the mortgage is created, and importantly does not require any default to be exercisable. However, if the parties agree on restrictions/amendments to the power of possession, it may therefore be altered.Four-Maids Ltd v Dudley Marshall (Proprieties) Ltd [1957] Ch 317, at 320 Regarding dwelling-houses and court issued possession orders, the court has the power to adjourn proceedings, and suspend or postpone an order of possession, if it is satisfied \\"that in the event of its exercising the power [of adjournment, suspension or postponement] the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage or to remedy a default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage\\".Administration of Justice Act, s36(1) This delay may be for whatever length of time the court believes is reasonable.Administration of Justice Act 1970, s36(2) The Consumer Credit Act 1974 sections 129-130 does the same for second mortgages. In an anomalous case, Ropaigealach v Barclays Bank plc[2000] QB 263 a bank had auctioned off a (second) house the owning a family was away. Clarke LJ felt unable to apply the AJA 1970, because properly construed, it was only able to halt proceedings when legal proceedings had in fact been launched, and here there were none. In a more borrower-friendly decision, Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society v Norgan[1996] 1 WLR 343 Waite LJ gave guidance that in ordering a plan for repayment, a judge should give \\"the period most favourable to the mortgagor at the outset\\", so that repeated applications to court on continuing defaults could be avoided, and so that \\"the mortgagee can be heard with justice to say that the mortgagor has had his chance\\".

The Gill Tract is 104 acres of land in Berkeley and Albany, California that the regents of the University of California purchased from the family of the late Edward Gill in 1928.  Historical Overview  In 1939 about 16 acres of the tract was granted to the federal government for a United States Department of Agriculture research campus, and in 1945 another 36 acres were conveyed as an agricultural experiment field station. During World War II the federal government requisitioned most of the Gill Tract, along with a larger amount of land in the City of Berkeley, for construction of housing for families of civilian defense industry workers and of U.S. Navy personnel. Following World War II this project, known as Codornices Village, was converted to housing for families of U.C. Berkeley students, many of whom were war veterans. University Village, a housing community for UC Berkeley students who are married or have dependents, occupies 52.5 of the original 104 acres.\\"Agricultural Lands,\\" Bancroft Library Archives, 364-B, Office of the President, 27 March 1950. A nine-acre portion is the current site of Ocean View Elementary School and public baseball fields. Urban gardening plots are available to University Village residents on 6.6 acres at the western edge of the Gill Tract. Ten acres of arable, undeveloped land are used for urban agriculture and agricultural experimentation and research; bound by Buchanan St. to the north, Village Creek to the south, Jackson St. to the west, and San Pablo Ave. to the east. Four acres of trees and grasses known as Albany Meadows, formerly University Village residential buildings, serve as part of a wildlife corridor in the East Bay. The remaining six acres held facilities for agricultural experimentation and student residential buildings until their demolition in 2007. These two areas; bound by Village creek to the north, Codornices creek to the south, San Pablo Avenue to the east, and Jackson Street to the west, are included in a plan for commercial development by the University of California, Berkeley. The history of the development of the Gill Tract has been described extensively in A Selective History of the Codornices- University Village, the City of Albany and Environs by Warren F. Lee and Catherine T. Lee, published in 2000 by the Belvidere Delaware Railroad Co. Enterprises, Ltd. =Pre-Colonial= The land now known as the Gill Tract lays within the territory of native Ohlone people. =Spanish Colonial= On August 3, 1820 Luis Mar√≠a Peralta received a Spanish land grant that included the acreage at Gill Tract. =Post‚ÄìMexican-American War= Sometime after the 1848 Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, a person by the name of Captain B.D. Boswell assumed ownership of land that includes today's Gill Tract. This Captain Boswell then sold the piece of land to its namesake, Edward Gill, around 1890. Edward Gill, a horticulturalist, built a home on the land and established a large nursery, which he operated until his death in 1909. Gill's son continued to operate the nursery until he sold his father's land to the University. =Sale to University of California= On February 14, 1928, the regents of the University of California purchased the 104 acre Gill Tract for $450,000. =World War II ‚Äì Federal government development of public housing (Codornices Village)A Selective History of the Codornices-University Village, the City of Albany and Environs, Warren F. Lee and Catherine T. Lee, 2000, Belvidere Delaware Railroad Co. Enterprises, Ltd. Copy in Albany Public Library.= In 1943 the federal government announced to local officials its plan to requisition a portion of the Gill Tract to construct wartime housing. The announcement of this plan was opposed by political and business leaders in Berkeley and Albany, as well as some regents of the University of California. City officials opposed the potential loss of tax-revenue to public housing; the university regents opposed the loss of a portion of the Gill Tract from their control. John Blanford, administrator of the National Public Housing Authority, pushed through the plan (War Housing Project No. CAL 4479) with the assurance that, under the Lanham Act, within two years after the end of the war emergency the land would be returned to the university in the same condition that it was received.Oakland Tribune, 16 September 1943, p. 31Berkeley Daily Gazette, 18 August 1943 pp. 1, 3, 6. Construction by the Federal Housing Authority of Codornices Village began by October 1943. John Melville, the first on-site manager of Codornices Village, stressed that no racial restrictions would apply to applicants for housing. Beginning in May 1944 housing in Codornices Village was made available to families of civilian workers in wartime industries, including Black migratory workers from the South as well as caucasian workers. In July housing was opened to families of U.S. Navy personnel. All of the social services in the village were racially integrated from the onset, two decades before the civil rights movement. These services included child-care centers, an elementary school (Codornices School), and a church. Codornices School, part of the Albany School District, served both Albany and Berkeley residents. By August 1944 Codornices Village comprised 1,896 residential units; 1,056 units were located on 75 acres of the Gill Tract (15 city blocks) within the City of Berkeley, while the remainder were located on 42 acres of the tract within the City of Albany. The initial unit rental charges, including all furnishings and utilities, were $31.50 per month for a studio, $36 a month for a one bedroom, $42.50 a month for a two bedroom, and $47 for three bedrooms. Throughout World War II the majority of civilian war workers in Codornices Village worked as shipbuilders at Mare Island, while another large portion of residents were Navy personnel who worked at the nearby Naval Landing Force Equipment Depot adjacent to the Albany Bulb. =Post World War II= In the Spring of 1946 the Federal Housing Authority disassembled nine two-story fourteen-unit apartment buildings in Oregon and reassembled them in Albany on the Gill Tract near the intersections of Jackson and Buchanan Streets. The project was known as Albany Veterans Village at Gill Court, and became the home to veterans and their families from its opening on November 15, 1946 until June 1959, when it was demolished due to health and maintenance concerns. Additionally, the US Navy constructed a complex of fourteen apartment-buildings on the Gill Tract by March 1945. This one-hundred-unit development, known as the Kula Gulf Navy housing project, was home to Navy Veterans and combat personnel and their families. On June 28, 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed the McGregor Act, which allowed the Federal Housing Authority to relinquish its portion of Gill Tract to the University of California. On October 31, 1948, the Albany City Council transferred ownership of the nine buildings and furnishings that comprised the Albany Veterans Village back to the University of California.U.C. Berkeley Housing List, June 1955, Bancroft Archives, 364-B. =University VillageA Selective History of the Codornices-University Village, the City of Albany and Environs, Warren F. Lee and Catherine T. Lee, 2000, Belvidere Delaware Railroad Co. Enterprises, Ltd. Copy in Albany Public Library.= On April 15, 1956, the UC Regents purchased 40 buildings of the portion of the Codornices Village located on Gill Tract and 14 buildings that comprised the Kula Gulf Veterans Housing from the Federal Housing Authority for $44,000. One week after this purchase the business manager for UC Berkeley, William W. Monham, recommended that the entirety of the married-student housing project be known as University Village. On April 30, 1956 the name change was approved by President Robert Sproul.Monahan to Clark Kerr, Chancellor, memo dated 13 April 1956, Bancroft Archives, 364-B, 1959. University Village continues today as a housing community for UC Berkeley students who are married or have dependents. A study on the Village Residents Association found that 46% of residents utilize food assistance programs. This is one of the reasons students and others hope to maintain this space as farm land. Urban agriculture  Beginning in 1969, plots for urban agriculture were available to residents of the University Village. Until 1975 the University would provide irrigation and an annual till free of charge. In 1979, a 12 x 20 foot plot cost $1 per year. By 1984 a plot cost $5 tilled, and $2 without a till. By 1990 and thereafter, the charge for a plot was $10 for the first one and $5 for each additional one. Hoses and water were always provided free of charge and a till cost $8 per plot.\\"Village Gardens Ready for Use,\\" The Villager,\\" U.C. Berkeley Housing, Village Office, Albany, California, April, 1984, p.1.\\"The Garden Patch,\\" The Villager, April 1988, p.4. Today, small plots for urban agriculture are available exclusively to University Village residents on 6.6 acres at the western edge of the Gill Tract. =Agricultural research = Since 1944, 36 acres of the Gill Tract were used as an experiment station for Biological Pest Management; known as the Experiment Station for the Center for Biological Control in the College of Natural Resources. In 1998, experimental land for the Center for Biological Control was drastically limited in order to accommodate epigenetic research of non-GMO corn to patent genes for the genetic modification of organisms. August 10, 2013 marked the beginning of a participatory research project between UC professor Miguel Altieri and forty participants from surrounding neighborhoods. The participants split into ten groups of four and each managed a small plot of land as part of a competition to see which group could grow the most pounds of food per square foot.

The village is situated near the Sharda Canal that passes through Katra, Kant and Kurriya Kalan. The village is medium-sized, with around 167 dwellings and a population of about 1,036 people. Banwari Lal, by caste a Kayastha, an Indian revolutionary and an approver in the historical Kakori conspiracy train robbery case of 1925, hailed from this village. Later in his life, he settled in the nearby village of Keshawpur, where he lived until his death. History The village of Tilokpur, named after Trilok Chandra, a Bachhil Rajput, is situated about 9 kilometers to the south of Tilhar. According to the Shahjahanpur Gazetteer, the name Tilhar was also derived from the Bachhil Rajput Trilok Chandra.* Dr. Mehrotra N.C. Shahjahanpur Etihasik Evam Sanskritik Dharohar 1998 Pratiman Prakashan 30 Kucha Ray Ganga Prasad Allahabad 211003 India page 114 Trilok Chandra also built a fort in Tilhar. The ruins of this fort can be seen in Dataganj mohalla of Tilhar. There were three big gates to the fort though now only two of them still exist. The city of Shahjahanpur was established by Diler Khan and Bahadur Khan, sons of Shri Dariya Khan, who were the commanders in the army of Mugal Emperor Jahangir. Demographics Although this village is very old, many residents have moved and settled in other parts of the country due to communal conflicts. In the past, this village apparently had orchards with rare plant species and people lived in harmony. Today the village is all but abandoned. The Hindu communities which still reside here are: Thakurs, Brahmins, Yadavs, Lohars, Barhais, Dhobis, Dahanuks Nats and Kahars. Amongst the Muslim community, some families of Manihars, Julahas and Faqirs remain in the village. Another community of Kshatriya Sunars, who were the oldest residents of this village, have left. Kayasthas have also left the village though some families of Gadariyas remain. The departures are often due to the lack of educational opportunities. The main occupation of the villagers is farming. Some Sikhs have also settled here but they do not mingle with the local residents. They live with family and their cattle in the Jhalas. Sunars The Sunars of this village claim that they are the descendants of one of two Rajput brothers, who were saved as boys by a Saraswat Brahman from the wrath of Parashurama when he was destroying the Kshatriyas. The descendants of the other brother were the Khatris. This is the same story as is told by the Khatris of their own origin, but they do not acknowledge the connection with Sunars, nor can the Sunars allege that Saraswat Brahmans eat with them as they do with Khatris. Owing to their association with the sacred metal gold, and the fact that they generally live in towns or large villages, and that many of their members are well-to-do, the Sunars occupy a fairly high position, ranking equal with, or above the cultivating castes.R.V. Russell assisted by Rai Bahadur Hira Lal; The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India; published under the orders of the Central Provinces Administration, Macmillan and Co. Ltd., St. Martin Street, London, 1916 Religious Practices Sacred fig trees grow in Tilokpur. These trees draw both Sadhus (ascetics), who meditate beneath the trees, and Hindus, who do pradakshina (circumambulation) around the trees as a form of worship. Usually seven pradakshinas are done in the morning, while the Hindu practitioner chants \\"Vriksha Rajaya Namah\\", meaning \\"salutation to the king of trees.\\" Outside the village's boundary stands a Peepal tree, which the local people call Brahma dev. Here, a mela (gathering) is organised on the day of Buddha Purnima every year. This sacred tree is said to be about 1,000 years old. Its trunk is about 10 feet in diameter, upon which the natural images of the Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh are clearly visible. The Brijbasi Nats ‚Äì a landless community in Shahjahanpur district ‚Äì are mainly musicians and dancers. At social functions, they are required to perform for their patrons, who tend to belong to the locally dominant castes.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part 1 edited by A Hasan & J C Das pages 355 to 357 Manohar Publications They come here every year and perform dances with music to entertain the God tree Brahma dev and the people on Buddha Purnima.

The historical cemetery was mostly destroyed with the construction of the road tunnel under Bratislava Castle in 1943 but negotiations with the clero-fascist Slovak leader Jozef Tiso allowed an important fraction of the cemetery containing the graves of the rabbis to be preserved encased in concrete. Later, when the tunnel was converted for public transport trams a tram stop was constructed above the site. In 2002 a modern memorial was erected above the site and it was partially opened to the public.  Location  The fenced area of the Chatam Sofer Memorial is roughly equivalent to the area of the former Old Jewish Cemetery of Bratislava. It is located at N√°bre≈æie arm√°dneho gener√°la Ludv√≠ka Svobodu Street and it is bordered by the tram tunnel to the east a wall to the north, New Apostolic Church headquarters to the west and the River Park development to the south across the street. It is approximately 70 meters distant from the river Danube. There is a public transport bus stop (one in each direction) and a tram stop (also one in each direction) called Chatam Sofer next to the memorial.  Old Jewish Cemetery in Bratislava  In the 17th century, Jews were allowed to settle in the area below Bratislava Castle on the estates of the Counts of the P√°lffy family. The Jewish community established a graveyard near the river Danube which served until 1847. Since then, the Jewish community has used the Orthodox and Neolog cemetery located on ≈Ωi≈ækova Street nearby. Until the mid-20th century the area was immediately adjacent to the Danube, set apart from any houses and quiet as traffic for Bratislava Castle and the city traversed ≈Ωi≈ækova Street and other roads above the site. In the 1940s, new structures were erected nearby to serve the International Danube Fair, later to become Park kult√∫ry a oddychu. At the same time, the riverbank was extended and the area filled with roads and tram lines and construction of the tunnel under the Bratislava Castle Hill commenced. The Old Jewish Cemetery continued to be well maintained until 1942-1943, when it was confiscated by the Slovak State and its anti-Semitic clero-fascist leader Catholic priest Jozef Tiso in 1943 to build a roadway and the cemetery was largely demolished. Most of the graves were exhumed and reburied at the Orthodox cemetery in a communal grave behind the beit tahara. Only the most precious section, where famous Bratislava rabbis were buried ‚Äì 23 graves surrounding the Chatam Sofer's tomb ‚Äì was preserved on the original site; members of the Jewish community helped to renovate the burial grounds of the Chatam Sofer after the war.The Story of the Jewish Community in Bratislava - The Return to Life, Yad Vashem. Retrieved 22 December 2013 Negotiations with the regime enabled the community to preserve this section of the cemetery including the Chasam Sofer's grave, enclosed in concrete, below the surface of the new road. Several explanations have been offered for the regime's compliance with the community's desires, One says it as a consequence of a large bribe while others cite foreign pressure or for fear of a curse if the graves were destroyed. This construction allowed the area of the cemetery to become one of the main access points to the Bratislava city center and today, the memorial is seen daily by thousands inside public transport buses and trams passing by. Until the 2000s, the area was separated from the Danube by a public park. The Bratislava City Magistrate and Mayor of Bratislava Andrej ƒéurkovsk√Ω sold this land to the company Henbury Development, which constructed the River Park development a few meters away from the site. Following the declaration of independence by Slovakia in 1992, new negotiations were undertaken to restore public access to the preserved graves. In the mid-1990s, the International Committee for Preservation of Gravesites of Geonai Pressburg was formed to support and oversee relocation of tram tracks and construction of a mausoleum. In 1999, the Mayor of Bratislava, Jozef Moravƒç√≠k, Chairman of the Committee Romi Cohn and Chairman of the Bratislava Jewish Religious Community Peter Salner signed a Memorandum of Understanding to allow access to the site. The architect of the new Chatam Sofer Memorial was Slovak Martin Kvasnica and the construction was performed by the company Raft. Construction of the mausoleum was completed after overcoming numerous technical, financial and religious issues and opened on July 8, 2002.  Access  Since 2002, the site is accessible to the public with restrictions. All visits must be arranged through the local Jewish Community at least 48 hours in advance and visitors must be accompanied by a local guide at all times. There is an entrance fee of $6 per visitor, with an additional $20 for access outside of normal operating hours. There is also a strict protocol and dress code to be adhered to including long trousers, hats for men and covered arms for women. Although in theory the site is accessible also to the citizens of Bratislava, in reality the Memorial is visited almost exclusively by foreign Jewish visitors, becoming an important pilgrimage site.

The race is for young riders aged 12 to 16, kind of a little Tour de France for kids. It is held during the summer break, lasting for 6 consecutive days. There are 9 stages, with road races and time trials. The oldest youthtour of Holland, it is ridden by the rules of the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Wielren Unie. History The Tour de Junior was ridden for the first time in 1958, making it the oldest youthtour of Holland. The first time the tour went international was in 1962, being probably the first youthtour organised in Europe. Since 1960 the tour has to deal with a competitor, the Youthtour Assen. Nowadays the Youthtour Assen is a bigger event than the Tour de Junior, with more participants. The tour was founded by Jan Schouten and since 1958 there have been only 3 other leaders. The current tourleader is Hein Ossendrijver, who took over from his father in 2001. The Tour de Junior has had a lot of participants that became professional cyclists, including but not limited to Hennie Kuiper, Michael Boogerd, Hennie Stamsnijder, Erik Dekker and Nicole Cooke In 2011 Michael Boogerd went to the 54th Tour de Junior and gave the first starting shot. Organisation The tour is organised by a union connected with the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Wielren Unie. During the week the participants stay in Achterveld. They can choose to stay with a local family, or go to the tourcamping. Many volunteers work during the tour. There is a first aid, and during the races the riders are guided by motorriders and the police makes sure nobody enters the course. Stages The Tour de Junior consists of 9 stages. The distance of each stage depends on what category the participants are in. On Monday the tour starts with a omloop, a large lap of at least 4 kilometers. On Tuesday morning everyone rides to a hill together for a up hill time trial of 1 kilometer. In the evening there is a street race with laps of 1500 meters. On Wednesday there is a classic. Thursday morning starts with yet another up hill time trial. This one is less steep and goes downhill in the end. The evening stage is the same as on the first day. On Friday morning there is a flat time trial of 4.5 kilometers with a lot of wind. The evening stage is the same as the Tuesday evening stage. The last day there is a critirium on a course with small laps of only 890 meters. Jerseys The leader in a classification get to wear jerseys. A yellow jersey is for the overall classification, a polka dot jersey for the fastest over the up hill time trials, a pink jersey for the best classified girl in the Under 14 category (a combination of under 14 boys and under 16 girls) and a green jersey for the participant who has won the most points in the sprints.

CSA also provides evidence to whether the implicated trait is inherited in a Mendelian dominant, recessive, or codominant manner. Purpose of CSA CSA is often a preliminary step in genetic epidemiology. The purpose of CSA is to provide initial evidence that a single gene has a major effect on a particular phenotypic trait. Only phenotypic information, not genotypic information, is required for CSA. CSA can provide evidence, but not definitively prove a trait is under the control of a single gene. Evidence from CSA studies can be used to justify which phenotypes might be appropriate for more in-depth studies such as linkage analysis. Study design and data analysis CSA requires phenotypic information on family members in a pedigree. A variety of models with different parameters and assumptions about the nature of the inheritance of the trait are fit to the data. CSA studies may include non-genetic models which assume the trait has no genetic component and is only determined by environmental factors, models which include environmental components as well as multi-gene heritability components, and models which include environment, multi-gene heritability, and a single major gene to best fit the data. CSA software uses a maximum likelihood estimator to assign the best fitting coefficients to each component in all models. Nested models are then tested for their goodness of fit starting at the most complex. If two models are found to fit equally well, the more complex model is rejected in favor of the simpler model. If the best fitting model includes a single major gene component, there is evidence that the trait of interest is under Mendelian control.

Beatrix and her husband were on opposite sides during the War of Bouvines, or at least at cross purposes. The period saw multiple invasions of the County, in particular from Renaud I, Count of Dammartin, and heavy damage from Philip II of France, to whom Arnoul was allied. Beatrix took Baldwin to Flanders about 1214; later he was able to effect a reconciliation with his father. Baldwin succeeded his father Arnoul II in 1220, aged 22. He quarrelled with his mother Beatrix, who died 1224 at Bourbourg. He was attacked by Ferdinand, Count of Flanders on his release from prison, where he had been for twelve years confined to the Louvre, since 1214 and the Battle of Bouvines where he had opposed Philip II.

In the same year Baldwin accompanied Philip Hurepel (Philip I, Count of Boulogne) in his expedition against the Count of Champagne. This amounted to an act of rebellion, against Blanche of Castile who was acting as regent to Louis IX; the leaders were barons from the north of France, and Baldwin was prominent among them. English involvement The connection of the counts with English lands traces back to the Norman Conquest and lands granted to Eustace II, Count of Boulogne. His seneschal Arnulf I of Ardres received six manors from Eustace, all but one in Bedfordshire. At least one of those, Stevington, was in Baldwin's family from the 12th century, and came to be held by his brother Robert. Baldwin resented the treatment of his manor of Newington near Hythe in Kent by Hubert de Burgh, who had appropriated it.Nicholas Vincent, Peter des Roches (1996), p. 323 note 50. In the latter part of 1233 Baldwin was one of the partisans of Peter des Roches, in the factional strife that opposed des Roches to de Burgh. He was rewarded with some of de Burgh's manors, and for a time recovered Newington.Vincent, p. 406. Baldwin acted as castellan of Monmouth Castle, in the name of Henry III of England, with a force of Flemish mercenaries.Alexander Croke, The Genealogical History of the Croke Family, originally named Le Blount vol. 1 (1823) pp. 64‚Äì5; archive.org.Vincent, p. 395 note 141. He was attacked on 25 November 1233 by the forces of Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. An account of the fighting was given by Roger of Wendover. Battle of Monmouth Baldwin fights Richard Marshal. From the Chronica Majora of Matthew Paris. Later life The County of Gu√Ænes. In 1238 Louis IX set up the County of Artois. As part of the new arrangements in the north-east, Gu√Ænes became a fief of the French crown. In that year Baldwin served in Italy, with the force of English and other troops under Henry de Trubleville. Baldwin's sister Mahaut married Hugo V, count of Saint-Pol, as his second wife, in 1241, having most of the fief of Tourcoing as dowry. Baldwin died in 1244 (or 1245 in some sources), and was succeeded by his son Arnoul of Ardres. Family Baldwin married Mahaut, daughter of Guillaume de Fiennes and Agnes de Dammartin, who was daughter of Alberic II of Dammartin and so sister to his father's opponent Renaud I.

It stands at the south-east corner of the town walls and permitted access to the town from the Platform and Town Quay. It is now an arts and heritage venue, and has previously served as the town gaol and housed the Museum of Archaeology. The building is Grade I listed and a scheduled ancient monument. History The original gatehouse was a simple affair, built in the late 13th century and known as the Saltmarsh Gate, as it led to marshlands outside the town. Being close to God's House Hospital, which had been founded in 1168 by Gervase le Riche as a refuge for travellers, the gateway became known as the God's House gateway. Following the French raid on the town in 1338, the town's defences were strengthened and the gateway was reinforced. The tower was further extended in 1417 by the addition of a two- storey gallery and a three-storey tower, to the east of the gateway; this was one of the earliest forts built specifically to carry cannon and had eight gunports and rooftop firing points. This spur enabled the town gunner to protect the sluices that controlled the flow of seawater into a tidal moat used to power the water mill under the tower. The town gunner was also responsible for making the gunpowder and gunshot which he stored, together with the guns, in the gallery of the tower. By the start of the 17th century, the building had fallen into disrepair as the town no longer needed strong defences and in 1707 part of the building was being used as a house of correction. From 1786, it became the town gaol; at this time, the tower was known as the \\"Lambcote Tower\\". In 1855, a new prison was opened in Ascupart Street and the prison in the tower was closed. The building stood empty until 1876, when it was requisitioned by the Southampton Harbour Board for use as storage, although the groundfloor of the gatehouse was retained for use as a mortuary. At this time, the buildings were restored and the exterior was cleaned. In 1957, approval was sought to convert the building into a museum: four years later in 1961, the Museum of Archaeology opened to the public and then closed in September 2011. =Statue of Prince Albert= In 1877, Sir Frederick Perkins, M.P. for Southampton, presented the town with a terracotta statue of Prince Albert which was placed at the eastern end of the building. Perkins had paid ¬£300 for the statue in 1869 and had presented it to the Albert Infirmary at Bishops Waltham; on the closure of the infirmary, he donated it to the town of Southampton. The statue was designed by William Theed and made at the terracotta works in Lambeth. In 1912, the statue was in a dilapidated condition and to prevent offence to Kaiser William II, Prince Albert's grandson, who was visiting the town, the statue was removed and put into store. During the First World War, the statue was destroyed by Royal Engineers who found it in the corporation's storage yard. =Museum of Archaeology= From 1961 to September 2011, God's House Tower was occupied by the city's Museum of Archaeology. The museum had three main galleries which told the story of Southampton in the Roman, Saxon and Medieval periods. In September 2011, the museum was closed and its exhibits were transferred to the new SeaCity Museum which opened in April 2012. The city council then made the lease of the former museum premises available for up to 20 years, with a possibility of them being used as offices or a gallery. The artefacts are now displayed in the \\"Gateway to the World\\" exhibition in the new museum. =Arts and heritage venue= In 2019, God's House Tower reopened as an arts and heritage venue, with a permanent gallery about the history of the building, two new galleries showing contemporary art and important works from prestigious South Coast collections, access to the views from the roof and a branch of Hoxton Bakery. Salisbury and Southampton Canal The short-lived Salisbury and Southampton Canal, which operated between 1802 and 1808, entered the River Test by way of a lock adjacent to God's House Tower. Although the canal company claimed that they had constructed \\"an arch under the Debtors Gaol in Southampton, wide enough for barges to go out of the lock into open water\\", the actual lock was just to the north of the tower. From here, the canal followed a route just outside the town walls northwards until its junction with the Northam branch at what is now Palmerston Park. Architecture =Exterior= The gatehouse and tower are built of stone \\"rubble\\" and are two or three storeys high. The arched gateway had a double portcullis, the grooves of which are still visible. The windows are described as \\"trefoil or cinquefoil headed lights\\". Under the main tower, the filled in arches of the tidal moat and sluices are visible on both the southern and northern flanks. In the upper storey of the Tower and the connecting gallery there are a series of two-light windows and keyhole-shaped gunports. These were unblocked in the late nineteenth century when the window tracery was also restored. The roof of the tower is modern. = Interior= Prior to its restoration in 1961, the gallery was just a shell and both the floor and stairs had long since disappeared. A modern staircase was built and a mezzanine floor inserted between the two floors. The remains of a mural stairway leading to a parapet above is still visible. Nearby buildings Opposite the gateway, in Winkle Street, is the only other remaining substantial part of the original hospital, the Church of St. Julien. Just outside the gate is the Old Bowling Green, the oldest bowling green in the world which dates back to at least 1299. Tower House, which adjoins the gateway to the west, was built in the 19th century, replacing an earlier building. This is also a Grade II listed building. In 2012, it was occupied by \\"a space arts\\", providing studio space for \\"emerging\\" artists.

Plot The young and beautiful Suzanne O'Neill (Barbara Britton) works as a waitress in her fianc√© William \\"Bill\\" Harris's (William Henry) diner. Suzanne's problem is that Bill doesn't want to decide on a wedding date. He claims that he doesn't have enough money to get married; he wants to be able to support her on his own first, so that she doesn't have to work at all. But Suzanne gets tired of Bill's pride getting in the way of her dreams for the future. Suzanne starts betting on horse races, using her \\"lucky pin\\" to pick the right ones for the infamous and not always apt gambler Jonathan Tuttle (Frank Darien). When Tuttle passes away shortly after their enterprise has taken off, Suzanne finds out that he has left her seven thousand dollars through his will. She is more than surprised, since he wasn't that successful in his gambling. Suzanne takes the money to Bill, offering him to use them to scale up his business, but once again his pride comes in the way. She decides to leave Bill, returns the engagement ring, and leaves for New York to try her own wings of fortune. Her lucky pin continues to prove itself useful when she manages to pick a very profitable stock at one of the city's reputable investment corporations: Hendrick Courtney, Sr. and Sons. The firms manager, Hendrick 'Hank' Courtney Jr. is baffled by her performance, and lets her go on picking several more stocks to see where she lands. It runs out she is more than lucky and she makes the firm a neat load of cash in a very short span of time. Both the gloomy Hank and his more outgoing, easier younger brother Rex fall in love with Suzanne. She is overwhelmed by the attention and starts dating both brothers, even if she can't forget her previous fianc√© Bill. She arranges, with the help of one of the brothers, that some of her money is sent to Bill, disguised as an inheritance from an aunt. Without struggling with his pride, Bill invests the money in a new and bigger diner, and he is ready to try to win back his lost love Suzanne. Another waitress of his has taken an interest in him and tries to convince him to give up waiting for Suzanne, and choose her instead. Suzanne finds herself now being courted also by the two brothers' father, who has fallen for the charming former waitress head over heels. Despite this she manages to sneak away and come to the opening of Bill's new diner. She is hoping to talk her way back into Bill's life, but the rivaling waitress spills vicious lies into her ears, saying that she and Bill are now engaged to be married. Devastated by these news just leaves Bill a note and leaves the opening without meeting him. When Bill reads the note he immediately goes to New York to reconcile with his love and tell her the truth. Bill finds his love in New York and they have a long talk during a Central Park coach ride, and it seems the couple will be able to let bygones be bygones. Upon the return to her apartment though, they bump into all three of the love-struck Courtneys. Bill is outraged and leaves Suzanne alone with the three men. After being abandoned by Bill, Suzanne decides to accept marrying one of the brother's, but without saying which one. On the wedding day, both brothers are left by the altar, and it turns out that Suzanne has been hijacked by their father. He has realised that Suzanne doesn't want to marry either of his sons, and takes her on a trip to look for Bill, in an effort to join them once and for all. When they arrive back to the small town they find that Bill has left the diner and all hope of reconciliation seems lost - until they discover that there is a re-opening of the old diner in progress, and Suzanne convince Bill to taker her back, with a little help from her lucky pin.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/74414/The-Fabulous-Suzanne/ Cast * Barbara Britton - Suzanne * Rudy Vallee - Hendrick Courtney Jr. * Otto Kruger - Hendrick Courtney Sr. * Richard Denning - Rex * William Henry -William Harris * Veda Ann Borg - Mary * Grady Sutton - Marstenson * Ir√©n √Ågay - Ginette * Frank Darien - Mr. Tuttle * Harry Tyler - Lawyer * Alvin Hammer - Little Man * Herbert Evans - Butler References Bibliography * Hanson, Patricia A. & Dunkleberger, Amy.

A former seat of the Barons of Tournel, one of the eight baronies of G√©vaudan, it was destroyed during the French Wars of Religion by Huguenot troops under Matthieu Merle.  Position  General view of the castle The castle is sited on a rocky outcrop which dominates the upper valley of the Lot. It is in a strategic position, taking into account the possessions of the Tournel family. From its towers, one can see Mont Loz√®re, the highest point in the region.  History  Arms of the Barons of Tournel View from the village of Tournel View from below Before the 13th century, the Tournel family regarded themselves more as seigneurs than barons.F√©lix Buffi√®re, Ce tant rude G√©vaudan, vol I It was in this period that the castle was built. At the time, the barony had split into five ch√¢telains: Tournel, Chapieu, Montialoux, Montmirat and Montfort. The Ch√¢teau du Tournel was thus the main and central of their possessions which extended through the Lot valley from Mont Loz√®re to Mende, and included the valley. The fortifications of the Ch√¢teau de Chapieu (on , above Mende) were consolidated by Bishop Aldebert III du Tournel, son of Odilon-Gu√©rin I, baron of Tournel. It seems that it was at Chapieu that the family was established before the 13th century (the name Tournel having been added later for Aldebert), since one can see the name of Capio (for Chapieu) in the name of the 12th century trobairitz (troubador) Iseut de Capio. However, around 1307,F√©lix Buffi√®re, Ce tant rude G√©vaudan, vol I, p. 366 the family decided to move away from the castle, preferring the comfort of the Ch√¢teau du Boy in the Valdonnez. The site was reputed to be impenetrable, and was thus a very important possession for the Tournels during the various wars and disputes that interrupted life in medieval G√©vaudan. However, at the start of the Hundred Years' War, the family thought more of heavily fortifying their castle at Boy than of returning to Tournel. The various wars of religion followed, during which the castle was destroyed for the first time around 1500. It then underwent the torments of Matthieu Merle's Huguenot troops, but was finally liberated with the arrival of the baron from Boy. It was then completely abandoned, without being restored. It has, however, been maintained since the 20th century and visitors can follow an explanatory trail.  Plan of the castle  At the time that it was inhabited, it was necessary to pass through seven entrances before being able to penetrate into the castle.S√©ances g√©n√©rales des congr√®s d'arch√©ologie Certain passages between gateways were close to the cliff which dominates the Lot, making it well-defended site.

The variation in load during the operation of a steam turbine can have a significant impact on its performance. In a practical situation the load frequently varies from the designed or economic load and thus there always exists a considerable deviation from the desired performance of the turbine.1966_jachens_steam turbines their construction.pdf ‚Äì‚ÄúSteam Turbines: Their Construction, Selection and Operation‚Äù. W. B. Jachens (Proceedings of the South African Sugar Technologists Association -1966 The primary objective in the steam turbine operation is to maintain a constant speed of rotation irrespective of the varying load. This can be achieved by means of governing in a steam turbine. There are many types of governors. Overview Steam Turbine Governing is the procedure of monitoring and controlling the flow rate of steam into the turbine with the objective of maintaining its speed of rotation as constant. The flow rate of steam is monitored and controlled by interposing valves between the boiler and the turbine.‚ÄúThermal engineering‚Äù Rathore and Mahesh. M (2010) Tata McGraw-hill.p.739. Depending upon the particular method adopted for control of steam flow rate, different types of governing methods are being practiced. The principal methods used for governing are described below. Throttle governing In throttle governing the pressure of steam is reduced at the turbine entry thereby decreasing the availability of energy. In this method steam is passed through a restricted passage thereby reducing its pressure across the governing valve. The flow rate is controlled using a partially opened steam control valve. The reduction in pressure leads to a throttling process in which the enthalpy of steam remains constant. Figure1: 2-D schematic of throttle governor =Throttle governing ‚Äì Small turbines= Low initial cost and simple mechanism makes throttle governing the most apt method for small steam turbines. The mechanism is illustrated in figure 1. The valve is actuated by using a centrifugal governor which consists of flying balls attached to the arm of the sleeve. A geared mechanism connects the turbine shaft to the rotating shaft on which the sleeve reciprocates axially. With a reduction in the load the turbine shaft speed increases and brings about the movement of the flying balls away from the sleeve axis. This results in an axial movement of the sleeve followed by the activation of a lever, which in turn actuates the main stop valve to a partially opened position to control the flow rate. =Throttle governing ‚Äì Big turbines= In larger steam turbines an oil operated servo mechanism is used in order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the oil chamber. The outlets of the oil chamber are connected to an oil drain tank through pipes. The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve. The variation of the steam consumption rate ·πÅ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the ‚Äúwillan‚Äôs line‚Äù. The equation for the willan‚Äôs line is given by: ::·πÅ=aL+C Where a is the steam rate in kg/kWh, 'L' is the load on turbine in KW and C is no load steam consumption. Nozzle governing In nozzle governing the flow rate of steam is regulated by opening and shutting of sets of nozzles rather than regulating its pressure.‚ÄúTurbines, compressors and fans‚Äù S M Yahya (fourth edition) Tata McGraw-hill.p.393. In this method groups of two, three or more nozzles form a set and each set is controlled by a separate valve. The actuation of individual valve closes the corresponding set of nozzle thereby controlling the flow rate. In actual turbine, nozzle governing is applied only to the first stage whereas the subsequent stages remain unaffected. Since no regulation to the pressure is applied, the advantage of this method lies in the exploitation of full boiler pressure and temperature. Figure 2 shows the mechanism of nozzle governing applied to steam turbines. As shown in the figure the three sets of nozzles are controlled by means of three separate valves. Figure2: 2-D schematic of nozzle governor By pass governing Occasionally the turbine is overloaded for short durations. During such operation, bypass valves are opened and fresh steam is introduced into the later stages of the turbine. This generates more energy to satisfy the increased load. The schematic of bypass governing is as shown in figure3. Figure3: 2-D schematic of bypass governor Combination governing Combination governing employs usage of any two of the above mentioned methods of governing. Generally bypass and nozzle governing are used simultaneously to match the load on turbine as shown in figure 3. Emergency governing Every steam turbine is also provided with emergency governors which come into action under the following condition. ::* When the mechanical speed of shaft increases beyond 110%. ::* Balancing of the turbine is disturbed. ::* Failure of the lubrication system. ::* Vacuum in the condenser is quite less or supply of coolant to the condenser is inadequate.

History In 1867, the Midland Pacific Railroad was established in Nebraska City. Midland Pacific began to build a line to Lincoln the following year, passing through the land owned by Mr. Cheney. A station was created on his land in 1871, named Cheney's Station. The village of Cheney was platted in 1874, a triangular map along the railroad. The first school was built in 1874 and a post office was established at Cheney in 1876. Cheney has played host to a lumberyard, a grocery store, three churches, a bank, a hardware store, a grain elevator, a general store, and a dance hall through the years, despite never growing past a population of 49. Formerly, Cheney was the eastern terminus of Lincoln's Old Cheney Road, a major east-west street in the city, but Old Cheney today passes roughly two miles north of the village of Cheney. Lincoln's southeastward expansion means that Cheney is bordered by the city of Lincoln to the north and west.

Wye Bridge Gate, East Gate (Dixton Gate), Monk's Gate, and Monnow Bridge Gate were access points to the town. West Gate, across Monnow Street, also provided access. Only the Monnow Bridge Gatehouse survives intact, albeit in a substantially modified version from the original. Background The castle of Monmouth was originally built by the Normans in the late 11th century, as one part of a system of fortifications to help establish their dominance of the Welsh Marches, and as a base for extending their control into Wales itself. The castle, which overlooked the confluence of the rivers Wye and Monnow in a strategically important border area, was initially a modest motte and bailey structure, rebuilt in stone by 1150. A small market town developed around the castle and, in 1267, it passed into the hands of Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster and son of Henry III. In turn, it passed to his own son Henry de Lancastre. On 27 August 1297, he petitioned his uncle, Edward I, to issue a murage grant for the town. The 1297 grant was issued for five years and the funds collected allowed for the construction of the medieval town walls and gates. Construction and extent On 1 June 1315, again at Henry de Lancastre's request, the grant was renewed for another three years, indicating that the project was either incomplete or in need of repairs. The murage indicated that the levy was to be on \\"all wares brought for sale into the town.\\" Town walls were regarded as necessary for several reasons: they provided defensive protection for the Anglo-Normans against the sometimes hostile Welsh inhabitants of the nearby countryside, they protected and allowed the policing of the market, and they allowed the easier collection of taxes and dues. The walls and gates also served as a status symbol. In addition to their defensive use, the town gates were utilised for hundreds of years to collect tolls. These were authorised by the patent rolls of 1297 and 1315. The complete course of the stone walls is uncertain. Gate towers were erected on Monnow Bridge and at several other locations, including Monk's Gate, Dixton Gate, Wye Gate, West Gate and St Stephen's Gate (the last providing access to the bailey of the castle). According to John Leland, who visited the town circa 1538, a ruined wall extended around the town at that time, together with a deep ditch or fosse. Monnow Bridge Gatehouse The Monnow Bridge Gatehouse is the most renowned and visible portion of the Monmouth town walls and defences. Combined with the Monnow Bridge for purposes of listing, the gatehouse is both a scheduled ancient monument and a Grade 1 listed building. The bridge and gatehouse were listed on 15 August 1974. The bridge on which it stands is a three span stone bridge built around 1272. The gatehouse in the centre of the bridge was added between 1297 and 1315, at the time of the construction of the town's stone walls. The bridge and gate at that time were very different from the present versions. Not only was the bridge narrower, the gate had a single archway with a portcullis. The roof of the gatehouse was lower, and featured a parapet with battlements. In addition, the machicolation arches on the facade of the gate were added later. By 1705, the Monnow Bridge Gatehouse was in need of maintenance, and the Monmouth Common Council ordered that it be repaired and upgraded. The castellated parapet had its battlements rebuilt as solid walls, and the roof was raised, producing a two-storey house. In addition, a timber framed lean-to extension was added adjacent to the eastern corner of the gate. While the gatehouse had been converted to a dwelling, a portion of it or the adjacent lean-to was utilised as a lock-up or guardroom when needed. The lean-to was demolished in 1815. In the early and mid 19th century, smaller pedestrian side arches were cut through the flanking towers, the upstream arch in 1819 and the downstream arch in 1845. In 1832, the gatehouse roof was rebuilt. Monnow Bridge served as an outer defence on the west, and provided access between the suburb of Overmonnow and Monnow Street, which led to Monmouth Castle and market. The gatehouse was last fortified and occupied by soldiers in 1839 at the time of threatened attacks by the Chartists from Newport, an event which did not materialise. In March 2004, a new bridge was opened downstream of Monnow Bridge; on that same day, the old bridge was pedestrianised, such that there is only pedestrian traffic through the Monnow Bridge Gatehouse. The changes improved traffic flow on Monnow Street. Monnow Bridge is now the only surviving medieval fortified bridge in Britain with a gatehouse which is positioned on the bridge. Remainder including East Gate 1610 map of Monmouth, Wales by cartographer John Speed Remnant of Dixton Gate tower, also a portion of the Monmouth town walls and defences The Monmouth town walls and defences are listed with Cadw and also have records with the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. The Monnow Bridge Gatehouse, part of the town walls and defences, is listed separately due to its particular interest. Aside from the tower which is incorporated into the Old Nag's Head pub, there are no other surviving upstanding remains of the Monmouth town walls. Despite this, archaeological excavations have determined portions of the circuit of the town's defences. The gates of the Monmouth town walls survived the walls themselves. However, Monk's Gate, near the Priory, was removed in 1710; it is feasible that the curved wall at the Masonic Hall entrance indicates its previous location. Wye Gate at Wye Bridge is also gone. An 1886 article in Archaeologia Cambrensis by William Bagnall-Oakeley, husband of antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley, discussed Monmouth and included an analysis of the 1610 map of Monmouth by cartographer John Speed, comparing it with the account of the circa 1538 visit by antiquarian John Leland, also Leyland. Bagnall- Oakeley described Leland's account of a town wall with four gates, Wye, East, Monk's, and Monnow, with a wall that extended to the River Monnow, as incorrect. Instead, Bagnall-Oakeley referred to Speed's map which apparently demonstrated a town wall which ended at the top of Monnow Street, near the Bayley (bailey). The author indicated that Speed referred to the gate at the top of Monnow Street as the West Gate, although there is no label to that effect on the map. Rather, the gate on Speed's map apparently represented St Stephen's Gate. The author indicated that there had been remains of a gate at that position \\"a few years\\" previously, which had been used as a gaol. Bagnall-Oakeley felt that the gate was St Stephen's Gate and that it provided access from the town to the outer bailey of Monmouth Castle. Based on his examination of the area with another Monmouth resident and his reading of military accounts, the author speculated that there might have been an additional, sixth gate, lower down on Monnow Street, expressing some disagreement with both Leland and Speed. That sixth gate, the West Gate, may be the one referred to by author William Meyler Warlow. He indicated that the medieval town wall ran from the River Monnow, in the vicinity of the Priory Mill, across Monnow Street, just above the level of Nailers Lane. That there was a gate with a drawbridge over a ditch at that level is confirmed by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Environment Record. Most of the East Gate, also known as Dixton Gate, was removed in 1770 because it prevented the passage of coaches. Aside from the Monnow Bridge Gatehouse which is given a separate listing as a scheduled monument due to its special interest, the only standing remnant of the Monmouth town walls and defences is the medieval Dixton Gate tower which was incorporated into the Old Nag's Head public house. The lower storey of the gate tower is older and has a battered base; the upper storey of the red sandstone tower has 19th century work. The red sandstone tower of the East Gate, part of Monmouth's defences, is on Old Dixton Road. The Old Nag's Head Public House is also a listed building of Grade II*. The building was given a higher grade due to its interest not only in its own right, but also because of the incorporation of a significant portion of the gate tower. In February 2012, proposed renovation of the building adjoining the medieval East Gate led to the recommendation of an archaeological field evaluation. Rivers The town of Monmouth is nestled between the River Monnow and the River Wye, just northwest of their confluence. The name of the town was derived from its location at the junction of the two rivers. Monmouth is the contraction of Monnow and mouth. The Welsh name for the river, Mynwy, which may originally have meant \\"fast-flowing\\", was anglicised as Monnow. The town was originally known in Welsh as Abermynwy (\\"mouth of the Monnow\\"), replaced by Trefynwy (\\"Monnow town\\" ‚Äì the initial m of Mynwy mutating in Welsh to f) by the 17th century.Hywel Wyn Owen, The Place-Names of Wales, 2000, University of Wales Press, , p.63 The natural defences afforded by the Monnow and the Wye in conjunction with constructed Monmouth town walls and defences provided protection to the town. William Bagnall-Oakeley, again in reference to Speed's map, described a rampart and fosse (defensive wall and ditch) which extended from the top of Monnow Street behind the houses in a line to the River Wye, then turning to the Wye Gate. The rampart and fosse then extended to Dixton Gate and, from there, to Monk's Gate and the bank of the River Monnow. After circling around the castle, it joined again at the top of Monnow Street. Thus, while the entire circuit of the walls is not known, the walls and ditches were constructed in close association with the rivers. In addition, Clawdd-du, the defensive ditch which surrounded the Monmouth suburb of Overmonnow, provided further fortification of the area. However, as the Monnow River was fairly shallow and narrow, it could be crossed easily upstream. Therefore, while the Monnow Bridge and Gate were built mainly for defensive purposes, ultimately their primary function was financial; they were utilised to collect tolls.

Such reflections occur for many types of wave, including light waves, sound waves, and waves on strings. Optics Light waves change phase by 180¬∞ when they reflect from the surface of a medium with higher refractive index than that of the medium in which they are travelling. A light wave travelling in air that is reflected by a glass barrier will undergo a 180¬∞ phase change, while light travelling in glass will not undergo a phase change if it is reflected by a boundary with air. For this reason, optical boundaries are normally specified as an ordered pair (air-glass, glass-air); indicating which material the light is moving out of, and in to, respectively. \\"Phase\\" here is the phase of the electric field oscillations, not the magnetic field oscillations (while the electric field will undergo 180¬∞ phase change, the magnetic field will undergo 0¬∞ phase change. Vice versa is true when reflection occurs at lower refractive index interface.) Appendix A Also, this is referring to near-normal incidence‚Äîfor p-polarized light reflecting off glass at glancing angle, beyond the Brewster angle, the phase change is 0¬∞. The phase changes that take place upon reflection play an important part in thin film interference. Sound waves Sound waves in air, in a tube Sound waves in a solid experience a phase reversal (a 180¬∞ change) when they reflect from a boundary with air. Sound waves in air do not experience a phase change when they reflect from a solid, but they do exhibit a 180¬∞ change when reflecting from a region with lower acoustic impedance. An example of this is when a sound wave in a hollow tube encounters the open end of the tube. The phase change on reflection is important in the physics of wind instruments. Strings Standing waves on a string A wave on a string experiences a 180¬∞ phase change when it reflects from a point where the string is fixed. Reflections from the free end of a string exhibit no phase change. The phase change when reflecting from a fixed point contributes to the formation of standing waves on strings, which produce the sound from stringed instruments. Electrical transmission lines Reflections of signals on conducting lines typically exhibit a phase change from the incident signal. There are two extreme cases of termination: short circuit (closed line), and open circuit (broken line). In both cases the full amplitude of the wave is reflected. ;short circuit: The voltage wave reflection on a line terminated with a short circuit is 180¬∞ phase shifted. This is analogous (by the mobility analogy) to a string where the end is fixed in position, or a sound wave in a tube with a blocked off end. The current wave, on the other hand, is not phase shifted. ;broken / open line: A transmission line terminated with an open circuit is the dual case; the voltage wave is shifted by 0¬∞ and the current wave is shifted by 180¬∞. ;reactive termination: A transmission line terminated with a pure capacitance or inductance will also give rise to a phase shifted wave at full amplitude. The voltage phase shift is given by : \\\\varphi = 2 \\\\tan ^{-1} {Z_0 \\\\over X} \\\\quad where :Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the line :X is the susceptance of the inductance or capacitance, given respectively by œâL or :L and C are, respectively, inductance and capacitance, and :œâ is the angular frequency. In the case of reactive termination the phase shift will be between 0 and +180¬∞ for inductors and between 0 and ‚àí180¬∞ for capacitors. The phase shift will be exactly ¬±90¬∞ when X = Z0. For the general case when the line is terminated with some arbitrary impedance, Z, the reflected wave is generally less than the incident wave. The full expression for phase shift needs to be used, : \\\\varphi = \\\\tan ^{-1} \\\\left ( \\\\frac {2 \\\\sin (\\\\arg Z) }{ \\\\left( \\\\frac{Z}{Z_0} - \\\\frac{Z_0}{Z} \\\\right) } \\\\right ) \\\\quad This expression assumes the characteristic impedance is purely resistive.

Early life Joseph was born in 1887 at Pampady, Kottayam to Pampady John. His father was a Christian who was converted from Pulaya (then untouchable) caste to Catholic Christian. Joseph was educated up to the sixth standard at Trukkakara Mission School. He moved to Thiruvananthapuram in 1918. Career Joseph worked for some time as a teacher. He felt that the Catholic Church was not treating newly converted Christians as equals to their Syrian counterparts, leading to dissatisfaction among the converts. Joseph believed that the Pulayars were the original inhabitants of Kerala and hence he called them Cheramar, which means the people of Kerala. He organised the Cheramar Mahajan Sabha on 14 January 1921 to protest against the traditional attitude and customs of the caste Hindus and caste Hindu converts. Caste Christians as well as untouchable Hindus were allowed to be the members and the organisation worked to counter the Hindu mentality and obtain rights. He thought that the Cheramar, Pulayar, Parayar and Kuravar are the Adi Dravida races of India. Joseph initiated the Sadhujan Dootan magazine in 1919, in which he wrote inspiring articles. It was published until 1924. Joseph, in his book Cheruma Boy, questioned the Syrian Christian's apathetic and discriminatory attitude towards the untouchable Christians. On 8 June 1931, Joseph became a member of the Shri Moolam Legislative Assembly in Travancore. In 1935 he asked the British Parliament to give allow the same civil rights for untouchables as were available to other communities. Joseph also suggested that untouchable Christians should combat their lack of equal treatment within religious bodies by constructing their own churches and temples. He also acquired land for redistribution among the untouchables.

A section called \\"Khi-yoga\\" is martial arts therapy with a focus of strengthening of inner organs, tendon-ligamentous organs, musculoskeletal apparatus, acquisition of steady state of mind which is not liable to stress. The initial complex in Khi-yoga is nine exercises for the Khi-belt development. Tam Qui School does not practice sparring fighting between students, because the spirit of the school and its ideology rule out competitiveness. To consolidate practical skills of fighting students practice twin exercises aimed at vision of an adversary, an ability to forecast his further actions and forestall them. Reaching \\"the ninth degree\\" is the criterion of spiritual and physical development of a practicing. \\"Nine degree\\" is Khi-belt, Tao, Ground connection, twin exercises and other exercises which are canonical form in the Tam Qui Khi-Kong School. While getting exam for a particular stage a student has to do the program of all the previous stages. There are 60-second intervals between the stages. Thus, it is not enough simply to have good physical conditions. The ability to control psychological status and correct structure of a body are determinant.

Amar Singh Thapa annexed Kumaon kingdom upon invitation of its minister Hari Singh Dev. However, resistance followed and then a battle. Later the deposed Kumaoni king aided the British in the Anglo-Nepalese War but could not restore his Kingdom. In 1788 Nepal attacked Tibet over issues of counterfeiting and granted asylum to Shamarpa Lama, who died during the war. Chinese Amban stationes in Lhasa dragged China into war, turning it into Sino- Nepalese War in 1792. Nepal asked for British arms which mediator Colonel William Kirkpatrick refused. Nepal was defeated and a peace treaty was signed with China. After the war, Garhwal submitted to Gorkhan sovereignty with its King continuing his rule. From then, Nepal began to see itself as the pan- Himalayan military Hindu kingdom demanding that hill Hindu kings surrender. However, as Kangra resisted with Sikh assistance, deposed kings began to ally with the British against Nepal. Late years Bahadur Shah's power and influence gradually declined so he retired to Bettiah once again. However, palace plotters invited him to Kathmandu where they imprisoned and executed him, accusing him of trying to declare himself King of Nepal. According to historian Baburam Acharya it was the king Rana Bahadur Shah himself who killed him by ordering hot oil to be poured on his body.

It is served by line S 2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. The station opened on 13 May 2007 and is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. Name and location Western access to track 2 The station is located on an embankment of the Main-Lahn Railway (Main-Lahn- Bahn), which marks the border between the districts of Sindlingen and Zeilsheim. Thus, the platform serving trains towards the inner city and Dietzenbach is in Sindlingen, while the platform serving trains towards Niedernhausen is in Zeilsheim. A street called Sindlinger Bahnstra√üe to the north and West-H√∂chster-Stra√üe to the south passes through an underpass to the east of the station. There are entrances from this street to each platforms, in both cases via a staircase and a ramp. A pedestrian underpass was built to provide a western entrance connecting to the Ferdinand-Hofmann estate and the Internationale Schule Frankfurt Rhein-Main in Sindlingen. Although the station is in the Frankfurt district of Sindlingen and not in the Zeilsheim district, it was named after Zeilsheim because Frankfurt Sindlingen station already existed. The name Frankfurt Sindlingen North station was rejected by Deutsche Bahn. The station cost ‚Ç¨6.75 million to build, funded by the city of Frankfurt, Hesse and the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association). History Work in April 2007 The communities of Zeilsheim and Sindlingen were incorporated into H√∂chst am Main, which in turn became part of Frankfurt in 1928. A commitment to construct a station between Zeilsheim and Sindlingen was part of the annexation agreement between Frankfurt and H√∂chst am Main. The Frankfurt City Council authorised the preliminary planning for the construction of the station on 29 April 1999 after several years of preparatory work. Construction of the project started in January 2006. Originally, it was planned to open Zeilsheim station at the timetable change of 10 December 2006, but significant delays and mishaps during the construction led the opening to be postponed to the spring of 2007. It was eventually opened on 13 May 2007. Thus the terms of the annexation agreement of 1928 were fulfilled after 79 years. Operations Sindlinger Bahnstra√üe View of track1 (towards inner city) The station is served by S-Bahn line S2, which runs between Niedernhausen and Dietzenbach. It operates on weekdays at 30-minute intervals, at 15-minute intervals during peak hours and hourly on weekends. The station is classified as category 5 station. =Buses= In order to improve connections to the station, the entire bus network in the western part of Frankfurt was revised at the timetable change in December 2006. The adjacent bus stop is served by city bus lines 53 (to/from Bolongaro Palace in H√∂chst), 54 (Griesheim station) and 57 (Siedlung Taunusblick), which connect the station to centre of the district. Zeilsheim station is also served by the night bus line N8.

Captain Merle is an example of the possibilities of social climbing and enrichment offered by the religious troubles. Biography He was one of three sons of Antoine Merle, an ennobled merchant from Uz√®s, and Marguerite de Virgilli. He was married on 20 October 1576 at the sovereign castle (ch√¢teau souverain or Castelsoubro) of Roffiac, to Fran√ßoise d'Auzolles, daughter of Guillot d'Auzolles, seigneur of Serre and Fran√ßoise de La Rochette. They are known to have had two children, Marie and Heralh (1583-1621), Baron de Lagorce and his father's heir. In 1568, he entered the service of Jacques de Crussol as an arquebusier in his guard. It was probably under Crussol's influence that he converted to Calvinism and subsequently converted his two older brothers, Antoine et Fran√ßois. He played an active part in the civil wars between 1568 and 1580, winning a reputation for cruelty, particularly during the taking of Malzieu in G√©vaudan in 1573 and Issoire in 1575. At the head of his bands, he acquired considerable riches from collecting ransoms and spoils. While his father had owned a single house in Uz√®s, two farms and a vineyard, Merls was able, thanks to his gains, to but the government of Marvejols in 1575, the manor of Lagorce in June 1582, and other fiefdoms in Vivarais. On 28 April 1578, he was made a gentilhomme ordinaire (\\"gentleman of the bed-chamber\\") by the King of Navarre, as well as Governor of Mende. In July 1581, he retired in style to Uz√®s. The date of his death is not known precisely. The Marquis d'Aubais placed it at the start of 1584, but several attest that Merle was still living after the Battle of Coutras, at the end of 1587. His M√©moires, incomplete, were edited by one of his companions at arms, Colonel Gondin. Campaigns * Between 1569 and 1576, the fortress of Gr√®zes was occupied by his troops. * On 17 November 1573, he seized the town of Malzieu in G√©vaudan, accompanied by 25 to 30 soldiers and assassinated 13 priests as well as cur√© (parson) of Rimeize.Ce tant rude, G√©vaudan - Vol. I, F√©lix Buffi√®re, p. 828 He locked the most notable inhabitants in the tower and held them to ransom.Merle et 1 600 pr√™tres massacr√©s, Paul Pourcher, Saint-Martin de Bourbaux, 1883 * In 1574, he seized Ambert. * In 1575, he seized and ransomed the town of Issoire. * He failed before Saint-Flour in August 1578. * On Christmas night, 1579, Merle seized the capital of G√©vaudan, Mende, which had resisted him for two years.

As Metropolitan Archbishop of Seoul, he also serves as Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Pyongyang in North Korea. Aside from Archbishop, he was also the chairman of Catholic Peace Broadcasting Corporation (Korean: Í∞ÄÌÜ®Î¶≠ÌèâÌôîÎ∞©ÏÜ° or CPBC). Founded in 1990, this corporation included a Catholic television channel and a radio station, both of which became highly valued Christian voices and champions of values such as peace, reconciliation, the defence of life, dignity and inalienable human rights. Yeom was made a Cardinal by Pope Francis in a papal consistory on 22 February 2014 at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. He will be eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves until he reaches the age of eighty on 5 December 2023. Early life Yeom Soo-jung was born in Ansong, Gyeonggi Province, to devout Catholic parents, Yeom Han-jin (Calixto) and Baek Geum-wol (Susanna) descendants of Joseph Yeom Deok-sun (who were among the first Koreans to convert to Christianity) and Peter Yeom Seok-tae and his wife Kim Maria who were arrested and executed in 1850 for their Catholic faith. His ancestors were among the lay people who brought Christianity to the Korean peninsula in the 19th century, and his great-great grandfather and his wife were executed as part of the Joseon Dynasty's persecution of Christians. The Yeom family has kept their religious belief for generations through persecution, leading Archbishop Yeom, the fifth generation Catholic, to enter the priesthood. The third of six children, Yeom loves explaining how he discovered and cultivated his priestly vocation thanks to family prayer: his grandmother Magdalena Park and his mother, went to Mass every day for 30 years to pray for their children to become priests. His two brothers Yeom Soo-wan and Yeom Soo-eui have also followed him, currently leading two dioceses in Seoul. =Further studies= At the age of 15, Yeom decided to become a priest and entered the seminary. He graduated from the Catholic University of Korea in 1970 before being ordained a priest by Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan on 8 December 1970 for the diocese of Seoul. Yeom Soo- jung went on to obtain a Master of Education in Counseling Psychology from Korea University. He has also studied at the East Asian Pastoral Institute in the Philippines, while serving in various parishes.Appointments Priesthood After his ordination, he served as a curate from 1971‚Äì1973, then as President of the Minor Seminary, Songshin High School, from 1973‚Äì1977, and then served as pastor from 1977 until 1978. From 1987 until 1992, he was the rector of the major seminary, thereafter he was appointed chancellor of the diocesan curia serving in that role until 1998. After he left his post as chancellor, he was appointed as one of the Seoul Archdiocese's Vicar Foranes, and at the same time, as a pastor, serving in these two roles until 2001. He also served as a member of the Presbyteral Council. Episcopacy On 1 December 2001 it was announced that Pope John Paul II had appointed him, at the age of 58, as an Auxiliary Bishop of Seoul and at the same time Titular Bishop of Thibiuca. He was consecrated on 25 January 2002 in the Changcheon-dong Stadium, Seoul, by Archbishop Nicholas Cheong Jin-suk of Seoul, assisted by Andrew Choi Chang- mou, Archbishop of Gwangju, and by John Chang-yik, Bishop of Chunchon. After his episcopal consecration, he became the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Seoul and episcopal vicar for the pastoral and the apostolate of the mass media. Member of the Permanent Council and of the Commission for Missions, and for the Commission for the Pastoral of Health of the Korean Episcopal Conference; as well as president of the Committee for the Apostolate of the Lay. He retained these roles until 10 May 2012, when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as the next Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seoul. He succeeded his former superior, Cardinal Nicholas Cheong Jin-suk, 80, who had surpassed the canonical retirement age after offering his resignation back in 2006. =Archbishop of Seoul= The Holy See appointed Yeom as the 5th Archbishop of Seoul on 10 May 2012, succeeding Cardinal Nicholas Cheong Jin-suk. At the installation ceremony he said \\"We need to keep the dignity of human life in a society that takes life lightly. The Church will fight for that,\\" said Archbishop Yeom during the inaugural mass. The Seoul Archdiocese held the inaugural ceremony for the new archbishop on the 62nd anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, as a symbolic gesture, praying especially for the reconciliation and reunification of the two Koreas. Since then, martyrdom has left an indelible mark on his Episcopal ministry. His ministry has also been marked by constants references to the precious faith of martyrs which is seen an example of authentic testimony all Christians should follow no matter what their life condition or state. He also expressed a strong eagerness for dialogue, reconciliation and peace between the two Koreas to calm the tensions that are circling the peninsula, introducing the risk of a new conflict. The inaugural Mass was attended by Cardinal Cheong, Culture Minister Choe Kwang-shik, Vatican Nuncio Archbishop Osvaldo Padilla, political leaders including former opposition leader Sohn Hak-kyu, Rep. Kang Ki-gap and Gyeonggi Governor Kim Moon-soo. As Archbishop of Seoul, he is head of the largest local Church in the Koreas, and the officeholder is traditionally also apostolic administrator of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The Pyongyang diocese has been vacant since the death of its last ordinary, Bishop Francis Hong Yong-ho, who was imprisoned by the North Korean government in 1949, and later disappeared. =A growing church in Korea= According to statistics, as of 31 December 2011, of the 15 dioceses and 1 military ordinariate in Korea, the Archdiocese of Seoul is the most populous with 27% of the total Catholics in Korea. The number of Catholics in Korea is 5,309,964, an increase of 2% (104,375) from 2011. Catholics account for 10.3% of the total population. The total number of Catholics in Korea has slightly and consistently increased at a yearly average of 2‚Äì3% during the past 10 years. It has passed the 10% mark of the total population since 2009. According to the Statistics, the number of newly baptised in 2011 was 134,562, a decrease of 4.3% from the previous year. By gender, newly baptised men represented 73,228 and women 61,334. The number of infants baptised amounted to 25,717, an increase of 7.5% over the previous year. In 2012, the Church grew by 1.6%, as nearly 85,000 Koreans became Catholic. There has also been an increase in vocations to the priesthood and religious life in recent years. In February 2014, 38 new priests and two auxiliary bishops were ordained for Seoul. Government surveys have shown that more than 45% of South Koreans practice no religion and that about 22% are Buddhists. Yet when Catholics (11%) and Protestants (18%) are combined, Christianity as a whole claims the largest number of religious adherents. By contrast, Christianity is officially suppressed in North Korea under the communist regime, and unofficial estimates by South Korean Church officials place the number of Catholics there at only 5,000. Archbishop Yeom received the Pallium from Pope Benedict XVI on 29 June 2012 (the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul), along with several archbishops from various countries. Yeom was one of several Asian archbishops whom the Pontiff granted the pallium, one of whom being the Archbishop of Manila Luis Antonio Tagle. Cardinal-Priest The Pope named Archbishop Yeom to the College of Cardinals on Saturday, 22 February 2014. As Cardinal-Priest, he was assigned the titular church of San Crisogono. Yeom is the Third Korean national to be made Cardinal in the Catholic Church, following the two preceding Cardinal Emeritus Nicholas Cheong Jin-Suk, and the late Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan. On 23 February, the day after the announcement was made, a celebratory ceremony was held at Seoul's Myeongdong Cathedral, where he said, \\"I will make efforts to realize Pope Francis' vision of a Church toiling for the poor and those on the margins of society and to make it a Church serving the community. ... I respect efforts made by late Cardinal Kim and Cardinal Cheong, and will add mine to them.\\" His appointment as cardinal was welcomed by many Koreans, though only 11 percent of the country is Catholic. On 22 May 2014, he was named member of the Congregations for the Evangelization of Peoples and for the Clergy. On Saturday, 4 October 2014, he took possession of the title of San Crisogono. He participated in Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Vatican City, 5 to 19 October 2014, on the theme \\"The Pastoral Challenges of the Family in the Context of Evangelization\\", by papal appointment. Coat of arms Arms of Archbishop Yeom Soo Jung as Archbishop of Seoul. The motto below is Amen. Veni, Domine Jesu! (\\"Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!\\") The Coat of Arms of Archbishop Yeom features the Traditional Red Hat, or the galero, replaces the Green one with its 15 tassels dangling in two five-tiered formations from either side. Below the Red Hat is the Crucifix symbolizes the Holy Martyrs of Korea who were the victims of religious persecution against the Catholic Church during the Joseon Dynasty in the 19th century. The shield is a symbol of God's salvation, and the three Rainbow colors: Purple (Love), Blue (Hope) and Green (Faith). The Herald of a new life, Dove, symbol of peace as a messenger came in the past, and will come in the present and future, and the spirit of the Lord brings into the presence among us even today and revealed that symbolizes the Holy Spirit. The Big Star in the center represents the Virgin Mary as she protects the two shining stars below symbolizing the peaceful reunification between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Republic of Korea. An anchor cross and the two Greek letters \\"A\\" (Alpha) and \\"Œ©\\" (Omega) that all the hopes and aspirations of the Korean People will be in the God's plan. The background's color Blue, Yellow, and Red symbolize Peace, Sharing, and Sacrifice. Archbishop Yeom's Latin motto is taken from the Book of Revelation 22:20, Amen. Veni, Domine Jesu! meaning \\"Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!\\" Views Yeom's pastoral approach is also characterised by a respect for life and the mission. Respect for life is an aspect that is especially important to the Korean Church. The Church has focused its missionary work primarily on Asia. Yeom has been supportive of the Church having a presence in Korean mass media; he was instrumental in the establishment of the Peace Broadcasting Corporation in 1990. =Reconciliation Between North and South Korea= Cardinal Yeom made history on Wednesday morning, 21 May 2014 becoming the first Korean Roman Catholic leader to cross the inter-Korean border into the North. He and his South Korean priests traveled to a joint North-South industrial park in Kaesong, North Korea, to tour the complex and meet South Koreans working there. Yeom told reporters after his return from the one-day visit that seeing South and North Koreans working in harmony gave him hope that the two countries can \\"overcome their pain and sorrow.\\" The joint industrial park, located just north of the heavily armed border, is the last remaining cross-border rapprochement project between the rival Koreas. It combines South Korean initiative, capital and technology with cheap North Korean labor. Operations at the decade-old complex were suspended for months last year when tensions sharply rose over repeated North Korean threats of nuclear war. South Korean Catholic officials denied media speculation that Yeom's trip might be aimed at preparing for a possible visit by Pope Francis to North Korea when he visits South Korea in August. Fr. Heo Young-yup, who went to Kaesong with the cardinal, said Yeom didn't meet any North Korean officials there. Pope Francis planned to visit South Korea on 14‚Äì18 August to participate in the 6th Asian Youth Day, presiding over a beatification ceremony for Paul Yun Ji-Chung and 123 companions and bring a message of peace to the war-divided peninsula. Francis visit on 14 to 18 August 2014 has been the first in 25 years by a pope to the Korean Peninsula and the second pope to do so after Pope John Paul II.

Its initial use was as a timing distribution network for control and data acquisition timing of the accelerator sites at CERN as well as in GSI's Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) project. The hardware designs as well as the source code are publicly available. The name of the project is a reference to the White Rabbit appearing in Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.  Focus and goals  White Rabbit provides sub- nanosecond synchronization accuracy, which formerly required dedicated hard- wired timing systems, with the flexibility and modularity of real-time Ethernet networks. A White Rabbit network may be used solely to provide timing and synchronization to a distributed electronic system, or be used to provide both timing and real-time data transfer. The White Rabbit Project focuses on: * Sub-nanosecond accuracy: synchronization of more than 1000 nodes via fiber or copper connections of up to 10 km of length. * Flexibility: creates a scalable and modular platform with simple configuration and low maintenance requirements. * Predictability and Reliability: allows the deterministic delivery of highest priority messages by using Class of service. * Robustness: no losses of high priority system device control messages. * Open source hardware and software: to avoid vendor lock-in. Another characteristic of this project is that it operates completely on open source with both the hardware and software sources available.  Technologies  To achieve sub-nanosecond synchronization White Rabbit utilizes Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) to achieve syntonization and IEEE 1588 (1588) Precision Time Protocol (PTP) to communicate time and a module for precise phase difference measurement between the master reference clock and the local clock based on phase frequency detectors. White Rabbit uses the Precision Time Protocol to achieve sub- nanosecond accuracy. A two-way exchange of the Precision Time Protocol synchronization messages allows precise adjustment of clock phase and offset. The link delay is known precisely via accurate hardware timestamps and the calculation of delay asymmetry.  White Rabbit applications  At CERN White Rabbit was used for the new control system of the injector chain. At GSI White Rabbit will become the timing system of the FAIR complex. The KM3NeT neutrino telescope uses White Rabbit for synchronising the detector units. The EISCAT 3D radar will utilise White Rabbit for synchronization in the beam forming network. About 6000 detector nodes for the LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) experiment are synchronized by White Rabbit network. At least two Cosmic Microwave Background research programs (Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4) are considering White Rabbit for the timing of their data acquisition and control systems. Several companies have begun to commercialise White Rabbit for commercial applications by developing their own White Rabbit hardware and software. The first white rabbit element on the white rabbit project was the \\"white rabbit switch\\", financed by the government of Spain and CERN, and produced by Seven Solutions. In years 2015-2016 White Rabbit was successfully deployed by Horizon 2020 Project DEMETRA service #3 and tested for distribution Galileo precise UTC using ground fiber service.  A White Rabbit timing network  A white rabbit timing network consists of three important parts. * Precision Time Protocol - The IEEE1588 or the Precision Time Protocol is a time protocol designed to provide synchronization accuracy of 1 microsecond or even less, particularly for use in Industrial networks and Research labs where accurate synchronization is necessary. An accuracy of sub nanoseconds is ideally possible in PTP networks but, in practice, the master- slave and the slave-master links may be asymmetric and the resolution of the PTP time stamps is limited. Hence, the obtained synchronization accuracy in PTP networks is limited. * Layer I syntonization using SyncE - Just like the SyncE standard, the mechanism to operate all the nodes at the same frequency works at the physical layer level. Hence, there is no effect on data transfers because of this. The main idea of layer I syntonization is that the clocks in the network are not free running at a frequency, but instead, should be locked to a reference standard and be traceable. So, a network using Layer I syntonization has a hierarchy in the network: there is a master node which sends the frequency information in data streams and all other nodes in the system extract this information from the data stream and have a phase locked loop(PLL) which makes them run at exactly this frequency. This removes the jitter and frequency drift in the clocks that is responsible for the offset. * Phase measurement - As explained before, the frequency of the local node is disciplined using the clock signal extracted from the data stream sent by the master node. Then, the local node sends back its local clock signal to the master. As the local and master clock frequencies are locked, this clock signal is just a delayed version of the master clock signal. By calculating the phase offset between these two signals, a very accurate measurement for the particular link delay could be made. After finding the link delay, this could be used in the conventional PTP algorithm to achieve a very high accuracy. Components of a White Rabbit network are multi-port White Rabbit Switches and single or dual-port White Rabbit nodes. Both components may be added dynamically to the network. Cable length and other delay factors are automatically compensated by the Precision Time Protocol algorithms. Though conventional Gigabit Ethernet devices may be connected as well, only White Rabbit devices take part in network timing and synchronization.

He was also Bishop of Hildesheim as Berthold II.  Life  = Ascent to bishop of Verden = Berthold descended from the Lower Saxon Landsberg family (not to be confused with the Westphalian family of the same name). His father was Ulrich of Landsberg. He studied Law and obtained his JD degree. He became a canon in Verden and became a dean in 1464. From 1468, he administered the bishopric on behalf of Bishop John III of Asel, who suffered from ill health. In 1470, the cathedral chapter urged John III to abdicate and elected Berthold as his successor. His election was confirmed by Pope Paul II. = Bishop of Hildesheim = In 1472, Berthold and the city of Hildesheim support the candidacy of his cousin Henning of Hus as the next bishop of Hildesheim, against several other candidates. A feud ensued. Henning was unable to prevail against the provost and the local nobility. After another was with Brunswick and Hesse, he withdrew his candidacy in favour if Berthold. Berthold's appointment was confirmed by the pope and the pope also gave Berthold permission to continue to administer Verden. = Great feud = He tried to the financial problems of his bishopric with new taxes. In 1484, this led to a serious conflict with the city of Hildesheim, known as the \\"Great Feud\\". The citizens of Hildesheim even went so far as to take some of their bishop's vassals prisoner. Berthold countered with ecclesiastical punishments, such as anathema and interdict. Nevertheless, the city prevailed. As a result, the citizens began to strengthen the city's fortifications. Berthold ordered the city to revert the city wall to their previous size, but the city refused. War broke out again, with both sides plundering and looting the enemy's territory. In 1486, their differences were settled and a peace treaty was agreed. Nevertheless, tensions remained. = Foreign and domestic policies = Berthold concluded a treaty of alliance for a twenty-year period with Duke William I of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, who had been his predecessor's greatest enemy. However, it soon became clear that William would not support him in his conflicts with the local nobility. Several North German cities concluded an alliance against their princes; Hildesheim was among them. In 1483, the cities of Brunswick and Hildesheim defeated Duke Henry VII of Brunswick-L√ºneburg at Bleckenstedt in 1483. In 1488, Berthold travelled to Rome to object to an unjustified papal ban against the bishoprics of Verden and Hildesheim. He never managed to get the local nobility under control. In 1500, a nobleman from the Schwichelt family convinced the pope to pronounce a ban against the church in Hildesheim again. In 1493, he concluded an alliance for a twenty-year period with archbishop Henry II of Bremen. However, Henry's successor John III cancelled this alliance. = Promoting religion and culture = Because of the unsettled conditions in Hildesheim, Berthold resided mostly in the castle of Rotenburg an der W√ºmme in the Bishopric of Verden. He supported church activities. He patronized the cult of the Eucharist and the worship of Saint Anne and the patron saint of the diocese. During his reign, the monasteries of Isenhagen, Ringelheim and Grauhof were reformed. The construction of the nave of Verden Cathedral began during his reign. Berthold died on 4 May 1502 and was buried in Verden Cathedral. A cast bronze grave stone has been preserved to this day.  References   Friedrich W.

Federated VoIP uses decentralized addressing systems, such as ENUM, for location and identity information of participants and implements secure, trusted communications (TLS) for identify verification. Background The traditional telephone networks are based on the principle of point-to-point communications, for example, an office building sends and receives phone calls over an ISDN line to the telephone exchange. Early Voice over IP deployments have copied this model, sending phone calls over SIP Trunking (a virtual equivalent of ISDN) to an Internet telephony service provider (ITSP) (a virtual telephone exchange). Such paradigms have striven to emulate many of the aspects of traditional telephony, such as the telephone number. Federation Although the use of virtual exchanges (soft-switches) and ITSPs has reduced the cost of telephony, they have retained many constraints of traditional telephone systems. The fundamental principle of federated voice over IP is that it removes this concept of a virtual exchange, just as email has eliminated the concept of a centralized system of post offices. Although there is no formal specification for federated VoIP as a whole, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP/Jabber) both specify similar and compatible ways of implementing federated VoIP. In particular: * the use of ENUM to identify the SIP or Jabber addresses associated with a phone number * the use of X509 Digital certificates to allow the caller and callee to prove their identity to each other is specified in Domain Certificates in the Session Initiation Protocol and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core (s13.7) * the Debian project describes federated VoIP as part of their Unified communications initiative * the OpenTelecoms project describes federated VoIP and gives various implementation examples Implementation Implementation of federated VoIP involves a number of initiatives: * (optionally) registering existing telephone numbers in a well-known ENUM service, typically the e164.arpa DNS domain. * obtaining an SSL/TLS certificate for the domain(s) * installing a SIP proxy, an XMPP/Jabber server, or both * installing IP phones, or softphone applications on computers or smartphones To achieve maximum success, most deployments involve both SIP and Jabber, to ensure connectivity to any other party that supports only one or the other. This is not so difficult in practice, as a network that uses SIP internally can operate a Jabber gateway, and a network that uses Jabber internally can operate a SIP gateway. In either case, the SIP and Jabber addresses are in the form of email addresses and are almost always identical, so there is no extra effort required for the user of the service.

His students included Margaret Sutherland, Waldemar Seidel and Dot Mendoza. He was also the target of anti-German feeling during World War I, despite having become a British subject at the start of the war. Biography Edward Goll was born in 1884 in Kaaden, Bohemia, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Kada≈à, Czech Republic). His first instrument was the violin, which he studied under Otakar ≈†evƒç√≠k; he gave his first concert at the age of nine. He entered the Prague Conservatory, where his focus changed to the piano, and where he was one of only a handful of personal students of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. He later had tuition from Emil von Sauer,Historical Interpretations of Frederick Chopin Works a student of Franz Liszt. Goll was considered a wunderkind in his time, and often played for Queen Marie of Romania, who showered him with honours and gifts. At the age of 20 he was appearing in concerts in Paris under Arthur Nikisch and in London under Hans Richter and Henry J. Wood. He later formed a piano trio with the violinist Jan Kubel√≠k and the cellist Leopold Schwab, with whom he toured Europe.Australian Dictionary of Biography In 1911, Edward Goll was accompanist to the Welsh tenor Ben Davies on his tour of Australia. In Melbourne he fell in love with a local widow, and they married early the following year, honeymooning in England, and making Melbourne their home. In 1915 Henri Verbrugghen, the inaugural Director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music in Sydney, offered Goll a post there, but he accepted an alternative offer from the University of Melbourne Conservatorium, and also became musical director for Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne. He became a British subject in August 1914, a week after the outbreak of World War I. Despite this, his Germanic background led to a campaign of press vilification and a petition demanding that PLC dismiss him. The petition was rejected. After the war, Goll took refresher lessons from Eugen d'Albert in Europe and toured in the United States with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and Henri Verbrugghen. Another American tour was planned to follow World War II, but this was abandoned. He was an advocate for constant and unremitting practice; he was said to have spent five weeks practising one line of music. His students at the Conservatorium included Margaret Sutherland,Australian Music Centre: Margaret Sutherland Waldemar Seidel (the teacher of Noel Mewton-Wood, Don Banks, Peggy Glanville-Hicks and others), Nancy Weir, George Vern Barnett and Linda Phillips.Australian Music Centre: Linda PhillipsSydney Morning Herald, 25 November 2002 In the early 1930s he left the Conservatorium after a disagreement. He left PLC in 1935, and taught privately for the rest of his life. His private students included Judy Hall.[file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Compaq_Owner/My%20Documents/Downloads/JulyLink2014_full.pdf], Link: Latrobe City Community News, Issue 58, July 2014.

History Military use of Oberwiesenfeld can be traced to about 1784 Electoral Bavarian artillery units which used the field as a training ground. It was used as an artillery training site and as a training area by the Bavarian Army throughout the 19th Century. As early as the late 19th century the Oberwiesenfeld was used as a landing area for Hot air balloon and Airships, both military and civilian. From 1909 onwards the field was also used as an airfield. On 1 January 1912 the field served as the founding place for the Royal Bavarian Flying Corps (German: K√∂niglich Bayerische Fliegertruppe). The unit moved out to Oberschlei√üheim 3 months later, however. Because the field was also used as an exercise field for the Bavarian Cavalry, military exercises and aircraft movements could not occur at the same time. This was not resolved until 1925, when a permanent runway was constructed. The runway became necessary because in 1920 passenger traffic began in earnest with flying services to Augsburg and Berlin. A year later a service to Konstanz was added. In 1927 the City of Munich proposed to upgrade the airfield to primary airport. North of the Nymphenburg-Biedensteiner Canal was to become the airport, south of it was to remain the military exercise area. The first wooden buildings were built for the handling of passengers and freight in 1929, soon followed by a hangar. With the construction of a flight handling building the airport became a full airport in 1931. It remained in use as the Munich municipal airport until 1938, after which it was relieved by the newer and much larger Flughaven M√ºnchen-Riem. In its final year as an airport, it was used by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier, who tried to negotiate a peace with Adolf Hitler with the 1938 Munich Agreement.  United States Control  The airport was not used by the Luftwaffe during World War II. When Munich was seized by the United States Army during the Western Allied invasion of Germany in April 1945, the airfield was repaired by IX Engineering Command, Ninth Air Force and designated an Army Air Forces advanced Landing Ground, R-74. IX Air Service Command units used the airfield as a casualty evacuation and combat resupply airfield for only a few days until the German Capitulation on 8 May. The field was transferred to Air Service Command and the Air Force designated it as Oberwiesenfeld Signal Depot, under the jurisdiction of the 10th Air Supply Squadron. Oberwiesenfeld was transferred to control of the United States Army on 1 April 1948, it being re-designated as Oberwiesenfeld Army Airfield. Around 1950/1955 a helicopter unit with H-19's was stationed there. It was used as a military airfield by the US Army until October 1957, although the United States Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty broadcast from the former airport terminal from 1953 until 1968 when it was moved to other facilities. Known US Army units assigned were: * 1 Jul 1946 HHC CC \\"A\\" 4th ArmdDiv renamed HHT 2nd Con Bde; HQ Flight located in Oberwiesenfeld 1946 * 1946 925 Sig Co renamed Earding Air Depot Signals Div * 24 Nov 1950 2nd Constabulary Bde * 15 Dec 1952 HQ Flight in Oberwiesenfeld * May 1955 5 Cessna L-19's stationed at Oberwiesenfeld, unit unknown Civilian flying returned in 1955, co-using the airfield, and later taking over completely with the US releasing the airport to German civil control. Parts of the airfield were used for trade fairs of construction companies until 1966, after which they moved to the new Munich Messe.  Olympics  All flying ended in 1968 for the construction of the 1972 Munich Olympics facilities, the former airfield was completely removed and the land re-engineered as the Olympiapark.

History  After the Batlle of Cepeda, on 1 February 1820, where the caudillo of Santa Fe Province, Estanislao L√≥pez and Francisco Ram√≠rez from Entre R√≠os Province arrived in Buenos Aires to demand the dissolution of the national government and the end of Buenos Aires centralism. The victory allowed the provincial states that formed part of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata to separate themselves from the central government, obtaining each of them \\"Provincial Autonomy\\". On October 1 Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province, and achieved order in the province. Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez established a peace accord between the factions. L√≥pez accepted the mediation of Juan Bautista Bustos, Governor of C√≥rdoba, with the aim of signing a new peace treaty with Buenos Aires. Rodr√≠guez decided to try to end the war with Santa Fe, to try to re-establish peace and security in the countryside. Estanislao L√≥pez accepted to be in the negotiations, and to that end he had to quit the alliance with the Chilean caudillo Carreras. Representatives of the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and C√≥rdoba met at the ranch of Jos√© Tiburcio Benegas, to reach an accord to end the war and agree to convene a congress in C√≥rdoba. L√≥pez wanted Buenos Aires to give him a monetary reward for the losses in his province during the war, but Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez could not promise to pay it. Juan Manuel de Rosas was the leader who ultimately agreed giving him 25,000 head of cattle. Ram√≠rez was not invited to the treaty, which brought an enmity and a later confrontation between the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre R√≠os. The treaty stipulated: * Peace, harmony and good relations between the provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe. * A call for a National Congress in the city of C√≥rdoba, with the objective to organize the country politically. * The removal of all obstacles to peace.  Articles of the Treaty of Benegas  Article 1: There will be peace, harmony, and good relations between Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and their governments, leaving them in the current state; with their respective demands and rights to be discussed at the upcoming National Congress. Article 2: The signatories will work towards the successful meeting of a Congress within the span of two months, sending their representatives to the City of C√≥rdoba for now, until in agreement and unity they decide the permanent location for said Congress in the future. Article 3: Commerce of arms and munitions will be free between the signatories. Article 4: All prisoners of the respective provinces will be freed and sent to their neighbors. Article 5: The Governments are required to remove from their territories all obstacles to peace, abiding by this treaty with all the measures and precautions needed to strengthen the ties of reconciliation and friendship between the signatories. Article 6: This treaty will be approved and signed by their Excellencies, the Governors on this day, and within the following eight days it will be ratified by the respective Honorable Representative bodies. Article 7: The Province of C√≥rdoba acts as a guarantor, accepted by both parties; and so sign their representatives who have contributed to this accomplishment.

The taxation system was named after King Hiero II of Syracuse. The basic provision requires that farmers pay ten percent of their produce in tax to Rome. It is likely that the Lex Hieronica was an appropriation of both Hiero II's taxation system of his Kingdom and the Carthaginian taxation system of western Sicily. The date of establishment of the law is uncertain. It was likely implemented sometime in between the first two Punic wars.  The sources  = Literary = A 1st Century AD Bust of Cicero, the primary literary source on the Lex Hieronica The main source for the provisions of the Lex Hieronica comes from Cicero's In Verrem. Other primary sources, such as Appian, Polybius and Livy, claim that there was an agricultural tithe in Sicily. These authors contribute to the debate concerning when the Lex Hieronica was established. However, In Verrem is the only primary source which gives a detailed account of the provisions or refers to the Lex Hieronica directly.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History, 115-33. Edinburgh University Press, 2000. p. 124 In some instances Cicero refers to a provision pertaining to tax collection to the edict of Verres. These include a praetor's edict setting forth the laws of the praetor's area of jurisdiction, the praetorship of Sicily being rotated annually. Each praetor introduced his own edict. However, it was customary for a praetor's edict to conform to previous edicts. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine whether or not a provision pertaining to tax collection from the edict of Verres is a continuation of the Lex Hieronica or a new regulation.ibid. 343 This is due to the fact that one of Cicero's charges against Verres was that he interfered with the taxation practises.ibid. For this reason, further evidence must be sought if a provision from the edict of Verres is to be treated as a provision of the Lex Hieronica. = Archaeological = Archaeological excavations in the Sicilian town of Morgantina, a town within the Kingdom of Syracuse, have uncovered three buildings connected to the Lex Hieronica: two large granaries and a public office. The buildings date to the time of the rule of Hiero II. All three of the buildings have been found in the agora of Morgantina. For this reason, the buildings were most likely all public buildings.Bell Malcolm. An archaeologist's perspective on the lex Hieronica. In: La Sicile de Cic√©ron : lecture des Verrines. Actes du colloque de Paris (19-20 mai 2006) Organis√© par l'UMR 8585, Centre Gustave Glotz. Besan√ßon : Institut des Sciences et Techniques de l'Antiquit√©, 2007. pg. 187 The two excavated granaries have been named the Eastern and Western Granaries. The Eastern Granary belongs to the architectural style which was prevalent in the rule of Hiero II. The Eastern Granary is estimated to have been 92.85 metres long and 7.60 metres wide.Deussen Paul.W. \\"The Granaries of Morgantina and the Lex Hieronica\\". In: Le Ravitaillement en bl√© de Rome et des centres urbains des d√©buts de la R√©publique jusqu'au Haut-Empire. Actes du colloque international de Naples, 14-16 F√©vrier 1991. Rome : √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1994. pg. 232 This space was subdivided into 6 rooms, with administrative offices located at the northern end and vast storage facilities consisting of the southern halls which measure ca. 20 and ca. 40 metres in length.Deussen Paul.W. \\"The Granaries of Morgantina and the Lex Hieronica\\". In: Le Ravitaillement en bl√© de Rome et des centres urbains des d√©buts de la R√©publique jusqu'au Haut- Empire. Actes du colloque international de Naples, 14-16 F√©vrier 1991. Rome : √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1994. p. 233 The format of this building was deemed to be effective and successful to be continued on in use under Roman occupation. This is apparent as its style was used as a model for the building of other Roman granaries, such as that built by Scipio Aemilius in Numantia in 134 BCE.Deussen Paul.W. \\"The Granaries of Morgantina and the Lex Hieronica\\". In: Le Ravitaillement en bl√© de Rome et des centres urbains des d√©buts de la R√©publique jusqu'au Haut-Empire. Actes du colloque international de Naples, 14-16 F√©vrier 1991. Rome : √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1994. p. 234 In comparison, the Western Granary lacked the same monumental scope that was evident in the Eastern Granary. The Western Granaries size is more difficult to determine as its southern end was completely destroyed in the 17th century by the construction of a farmhouse. However, excavations have landed on the conclusion it was likely 32.90 metres wide and 7.50 metres wide. This granary had a single door and a ramp leading up to it on its short, northern end.  Provisions  The Lex Hieronica was an agricultural tax on all Sicilian farmers, except those in the territory of the cities of Centuripa, Halesa, Segesta, Halicya, and Panormus, Tauromenium and Messana.Cic. Verr. 2.3.13 The latter two cities were exempted from the tax due to their status as civitas foederata.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History, Edinburgh University Press, 2000. p. 120 The other cities were exempted from the tithe due to their status as free states immune from tax but not with foederata. The Lex Hieronica required that each farmer pay ten percent of their produce as tax in the form of a tithe. An extra tithe could be imposed when necessary. This tithe applied to farmers who produced corn and barley.Cic. Verr. 2.3.118 In addition, it is likely that the tithe also applied to wine, oil, and other minor agricultural products.ibid. 2.3.18 The tithe could either be paid in kind or in cash.ibid. 2.3.191-2 The number of farmers had to be annually logged in official records.ibid. 2.3.120 Modern reconstruction suggests that these records took the form of a three columned table which logged the name of the farmer, the amount of crops sown, and the amount contributed to the tithe respectively.Bell Malcolm. An archaeologist's perspective on the lex Hieronica. In: La Sicile de Cic√©ron : lecture des Verrines. Actes du colloque de Paris (19-20 mai 2006) Organis√© par l'UMR 8585, Centre Gustave Glotz. Besan√ßon : Institut des Sciences et Techniques de l'Antiquit√©, 2007. pg. 192 These public records were likely stored in a public building of the sort discovered at Morgantina.ibid. 187 The Roman senate sold the rights to collect the Sicilian tithe to contractors. The tithe collectors were known as decumani. Usually, only Sicilians could purchase the rights to become decumani. However, occasionally there were Italian decumani in Sicily.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History, Edinburgh University Press, 2000. p. 123 The rights to collect were sold annually at an auction.Cic. Verr. 2.3.14 Prior to 75 BCE the auctions were held in Syracuse. In 75 BCE the consuls Lucius Octavius and Gaius Aurelius Cotta moved the site of the auctions to Rome, except those contracts concerning grain.Cic. Verr. 2.3.18-19 The collection rights were specific to a crop and a region of Sicily.Cic. Verr. 2.3.78 The rights to collect the tithe of a crop were paid for in kind.Cic Verr. 3.2. 72, 75 For example, the right to collect grain was paid for with grain. However, Cicero also claims that the contracts could be bought with a monetary equivalent.Cic. Verr. 2.3.113 Finally, Cicero suggests that the collector received an additional 6 percent of the produce which he was responsible for collecting.Cic. Verr. 2.3.116-18 The price of the collection rights was determined based on records of previous harvest and the professiones of the farmers.Lintott, A. W. 1993. Imperium Romanum: politics and administration. London: Routledge. p. 75 A professio was a declaration concerning the amount of seed which had been sown. The collector and the farmer were required to come to an informal personal agreement, a pactio, concerning the total produce and hence the amount of produce which the farmer had to pay.R. T. Pritchard. \\"Cicero and the 'Lex Hieronica' Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte 19, no. 3 (1970): p. 358 The edict of Verres required that this must take place on the threshing floor.Cic. Verr. 2.3.36 It is likely that this edict did not differ from the requirements of the Lex Hieronica as Cicero charges Verres with only abusing this practise. The determination of the total produce would be too difficult in the field itself due to thickness of the crop.R. T. Pritchard. \\"Cicero and the 'Lex Hieronica' Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte 19, no. 3 (1970): p. 359 However, the true amount of produce could easily be hidden if assessment took place in the granary. Once collected, the grain tithe would have been stored in public grannies, like those uncovered at Morgantina. The edict of Verres also required the tithe to be delivered to the waterside by a specific date, the first of August.Cic. Verr. Cicero Ver 2.3.36 The Lex Hieronica probably contained a similar requirement as harvests would have been gathered in early July. Furthermore, Cicero seems to suggest that Verres was not wrong to demand delivery by the first of August, rather his abuse of the farmers would have made such delivery impossible. It is unclear whether the collector or the farmer was responsible for delivering the tax to the waterside. On the one hand, Cicero never claims that the farmers were manipulated on the basis of such a responsibility.Lintott, A. W. 1993. Imperium Romanum: politics and administration. London: Routledge. p.76 Furthermore, Cicero mentions no case of a farmer actually making a delivery. On the other hand, the language with which Cicero describes Septicus, a mistreated farmer in Sicily, suggests that the farmer was responsible.Cic. Verr. 2.3.36-37 Once at the waterside the tithe would then be distributed to the army, to the garrison in Sicily or to Rome for private sale. Transport contractors were responsible for shipping. Whether or not transport contractors were the tax collectors is unclear. Strict penalties applied to both the collectors and the farmers for violation. The Lex Hieronica established special courts in order to mediate disputes between the collectors and the farmers.Cic. Verr. 2.2.32-33 The disputes that the court mediated likely concerned the failure of the two parties to come to an agreement on the threshing floor concerning the amount of tax owed.R. T. Pritchard. \\"Cicero and the 'Lex Hieronica'\\" Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte 19, no. 3 (1970): p. 362 In the edict of Verres, the collector could be sued for eight times the amount wrongly exacted, whereas the farmer could be sued for no more than four times the amount wrongly withheld.Cic. Verr. 2.3.26 Cicero mentions that the edict of Verres had a provision referring to a public official known as the magistratus siculus. It is likely that the magistratus siculus was also a provision of the Lex Hieronica. This is due to the fact that Cicero charges Verres for using the magistrate as a tool for intimidating the farmer, not with implementing the magistracy itself. Cicero is ambiguous about the role of the magistratus siculus. Cicero states each of the tax paying cities had a magistratus siculus who served as an arbiter between farmers and the collectors when they had to agree on the amount of grain due.Cic.Verr.2.3.34, 117 Cicero also mentions magistrates, without the adjective siculus, who were responsible for: annually recording the names of the farmers who had sown seeds, the amount in seeds sown by each and, how much tithe each farmer had paid after the harvest.Cic.Verr.2.3.120 Modern scholars have argued that these magistrates are the magistratus siculus.Bell Malcolm. An archaeologist's perspective on the lex Hieronica. In: La Sicile de Cic√©ron : lecture des Verrines. Actes du colloque de Paris (19-20 mai 2006) Organis√© par l'UMR 8585, Centre Gustave Glotz. Besan√ßon : Institut des Sciences et Techniques de l'Antiquit√©, 2007. Furthermore, modern scholars have argued that that magistratus siculus occupied a public office like the one uncovered at Morgantina. This is due to the fact that the magistratus siculus was responsible for the public documents which were likely to have been stored in the public office. Archeological remains of a granary at Morgantina  Precedents  When Rome annexed Sicily in 241 BCE, it became Rome's first overseas territory. As such, Rome had no precedents concerning overseas territorial management. The institutions which Rome developed in order to manage Sicily, as consistent with Roman practise elsewhere, grew out of the local governance structures which pre-dated Roman presence.Serrati, J. (2016). Early Provincial Economies in the West: The lex Hieronica and the Financing of Roman Conquest. In H. Beck, M. Jehne and J. Serrati (Eds.) Money and Power in the Roman Republic. Brussels: Latomus.114-130. The Lex Hieronica was no exception. Precedents for the Lex Hieronica, as pictured in Cicero's In Verrem, can be found in both Carthaginian Sicily and in the kingdom of Sicily, ruled by Hiero II. The Carthaginians had taxed their subjects in Sicily for centuries with an agricultural tithe.Diod. 13.59.3, 114.1, 14.65.2 Polybius reports that Rome was both physically and economically exhausted at the end of the first Punic war.Poly. 1.58.9 For this reason, it seems reasonable that Romans would have sought to recuperate through the existing tax structures.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History, pp. 115-133 Comparatively, after conquering the port city of Lilybaeum, the Romans left in place the existing Carthaginian tariffs.Cic. Verr 2.2.171, 185. 2.3.167) For this reason, it is plausible that the Romans left other taxes in place after their initial conquest.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 125 King Hiero the II of Syracuse had a lucrative tax system in place over his subjects.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 118 Like in Carthaginian Sicily, Hiero II charged his subjects with an agricultural tithe. The tithe was likely stored in public granaries like those discovered at Morgantina. Roman appropriation of Hiero's taxation system is evident in archaeological remains at Morgantina which show that the public office continued to be utilised during Roman rule. Furthermore, Cicero tells us that the Romans had never changed local taxation systems of Sicily until Verres' corrupt praetorship.Cic.Verr.2.3.12-3, 15 This is likely to be an exaggeration. However, it seems likely that if the Romans had removed any tax burdens then Cicero would have used this instance of Roman magnanimity to further demonstrate Verres' corruption.Serrati, J. (2016). Early Provincial Economies in the West: The lex Hieronica and the Financing of Roman Conquest. In H. Beck, M. Jehne and J. Serrati (Eds.) Money and Power in the Roman Republic. Brussels: Latomus. p. 106. Given the presence of a tithe in Punic Sicily and the kingdom of Syracuse, it seems likely that the Sicilians had always paid a tithe. The primary change which the Romans made to the Sicilian taxation systems was that the tithe now was now paid to Rome, rather than Carthage or to Hiero.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, pp. 115-133. = Hiero II and Ptolemaic taxation = It has been argued that Hiero II's taxation system was influenced by Ptolemy II Philadelphus' revenue laws as these systems bear many structural similarities. Like Hiero's taxation system, the Ptolemaic revenue laws also required an agricultural tithe and annually renewed tax collectors. Both systems placed emphasis on record keeping, with Cicero's In Verrem demonstrating documented taxation. It is further evident this occurred in Egypt as well, with signed copies of agreements being held by all parties to an exchange. Both systems employed a recognised area where taxation agreements were discussed and formed between the farmer and collector. In Egypt this took place around the wine press, a practice that is embodied in Syracuse, as discussions took place on the threshing room floor. Further, both systems employ a degree of civic regulation and had mechanisms of referring disputes to civic actors such as the city magistrates in Syracuse, and in Egypt the issues being referred to the chief financial officers or \\"nome\\". Whilst many similarities are evident, it has conversely been argued that the basic principles and underlying spirit of the two systems remained completely different. This is supported by notable differences within the systems. For example, the Ptolemaic system used royal officials to collect the tax, whereas the Lex Hieronica allowed that any Sicilian could collect the tax, provided they could afford the rights.  Date of establishment  At some point, the Romans decided to codify the local taxation systems under the Lex Hieronica and implement them across Sicily. However, it is impossible to exactly date the establishment of the Lex Hieronica. No primary source explicitly names the Lex Hieronica other than Cicero. Cicero does not explicitly date when the Lex Hieronica was codified or implemented. Rather, any date concerning the establishment of the Lex Hieronica must be derived from indirect evidence. Some scholars suggest that the Lex Hieronica was only implemented after 210 BCE.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History Edinburgh University Press, 2000. p. 125 In 210 BCE Valerius Laevinus led an army against Syracuse due its defection to Carthage during the second Punic war and conquered the city. Then, in order to recuperate from war losses, the Romans would have immediately adopted the already existing taxation system which had been in place since Hiero II and extended the tax across Sicily. This interpretation makes sense of the fact that Laevinus then encouraged the Sicilian who had been displaced from their farms during the war, to start farming again.Cornell T.(1996),'Hannibal's legacy: the effects of the Hannabalic War on Italy,' in T. Cornell, B. Rankov and P.Sabin (eds), The Second Punic War: A Reappraisal, London: Institute of Classical Studies, University of London, pg. 97-117 There are several sources which suggest that the Romans taxed their Sicilian subjects prior to 210 BCE. Polybius suggests that in 251 BC the Romans were cooperating with their Sicilian allies in the extraction of an agricultural tithe in Panormos.Poly. 1.40.1 This was not a regular tithe implemented across the whole of Sicily per the Lex Hieronica. However, this shows that the Romans were at least familiar with local practices of taxation prior as early as 251 BCE. Furthermore, Rome conquered Panormos in 254 BCE. Hence, it is possible that Rome was at least familiar with local practises as early as 254 BCE. Appian claims that after the first Punic war, the Sicilians under Roman rule were subjected to an agricultural tithe.App. 2.2 In the same passage, Appian states that Rome also sent a praetor to Sicily in 241 BCE. However, other sources contradict this claiming that the first Sicilian praetor arrived in 227 BCE. This does not necessarily invalidate Appian's claims about the implementation of the tithe. Further evidence for 241 BCE from Cicero. Cicero reports that the Sicilian city Segesta was declared to be free from tax because of their claimed kinship to Aeneas.Cic.Verr.2.4.72 In 241 BCE the Segetians began minting coins depicting Aeneas. If these two events coincide, then, there must have been a tax to be exempted from in 241 BCE. Similarly, in 213 BCE, the Sicilian city Tauromenium was made a civitas foederata.App. 5; Cic. Verr 2.5.56 Hence, it was declared to be free from paying an agricultural tithe. Therefore, there must have been an agricultural tax to be exempted from in Sicily prior to 213 BCE. Finally, Livy claims that all the Sicilians had paid tax to Rome in kind prior to 218 BC, the outbreak of the second Punic war.Liv. 23.48.7 These sources suggest that Rome imposed an agricultural tithe on some of its Sicilian subjects prior to the second Punic war. However, it remains impossible to determine when the Romans appropriated Hiero's taxation system or when it was applied to all of Sicily.  The Lex Hieronica and the Roman military  The Lex Hieronica main purpose was to address Rome's changing military logistics. The First Punic War presented Rome with the dilemma on how it could sustain its manpower long term in foreign wars far from the Italian mainland.ibid. With an increasing need for supplies away from Rome, legislation like the Lex Hieronica, which presented a reliable tithe of one tenth of Sicilian grain supply,Cic. Verr. 2.3.15 solved this issue during Rome's time of imperial expansion. The tithe from Sicily was used to feed Roman garrisons on the island and to feed Roman armies overseas.ibid. 120 Livy recounts an example of this, when he writes about Sicily sending the Roman army in Macedonia food and clothing in 198 BCE.Livy 32.27.2-3 Additionally to military supply, there is some modern speculation about whether the city of Rome itself received a portion of the Sicilian tithe. There is a strong possibility that some of the grain was sent to the capital, given ancient accounts of the desperate need for grain in Rome.Serrati, John 'The Financing of Conquest: Roman Interaction with Hellenistic Tax Laws'. In Money and Power in the Roman Republic, Collection Latomus, 355, 97-113 2016. p. 98 Further evidence for this comes from ancient and modern sources correlating years of large grain supply being sent to Rome in the same year with years that Sicily had an unusually large harvests.Serrati, John 'The Financing of Conquest: Roman Interaction with Hellenistic Tax Laws'. In Money and Power in the Roman Republic, Collection Latomus, 355, 97-113 2016. pg 110; Livy 30.38.5 Despite this, Sicily's tithe definitely served a primarily military purpose, but these observations stimulate discussion for future debates on other uses of the spoils of the Lex Hieronica.  The Lex Hieronica and Roman politics  The Lex Hieronica was also a key political and cultural instrument in the development of the concept of a provincia and the framework of territorial administration. A provincia was an area of Roman responsibility and a place where Roman imperialism was recognised and obeyed.Serrati, John, and Christopher Smith. \\"Garrisons and Grain: Sicily between the Punic Wars\\" In Sicily from Aeneas to Augustus: New Approaches in Archaeology and History, Edinburgh University Press. p. 121 The need for extra protection and regulation in Sicily stemmed from its role as a bridge between Rome and Carthage. Although the Romans drove Carthage from Sicily and its surrounding islands after their victory in the first Punic War, the enduring proximity of Carthaginian forces across the sea created a unique volatility in Sicily that required special attention.ibid. The descriptions of the Sicilians in Cicero's In Verrem portray the unusually close alliance that formed out of Rome's new provincial administration. Cicero describes Sicily as 'a valuable assistant both in war and peace' and praises his ancestors for 'defending the Sicilians and retaining their allegiance.'Cic. Ver. 2.3.14 In describing the crimes of Verres, Cicero expands further, speaking of the victimised farmers of Sicily as a 'virtuous and honest and honourable class of men.'Cic. Ver. 2.3.27 He then addresses the Lex Hieronica regulations as 'respectful' towards their important role as the 'cultivators of soil.'ibid. The intimacy of Roman- Sicilian relations portrayed by Cicero reflects Lex Hieronica's role in establishing a cohesive framework for integrating foreign lands into the Roman system as a provincia, without destroying the integrity of their own cultures.Serrati, John \\"The Financing of Conquest: Roman Interaction with Hellenistic Tax Laws\\". In Money and Power in the Roman Republic, Collection Latomus, 355, 97-113 2016. pg 99 Whilst Cicero is able to construct his oratory around a bond of closeness and respect within the Roman and Sicilian relationship, the political and cultural context behind this bond is necessary to grasp the purpose of the Lex Hieronica. Beyond the portrayal of intimate relations between Sicily and Rome dictated by Cicero, it is principally clear that the Romans sought to implement an effective system that was going to serve its own primary and immediate needs. These immediate needs are described to us as being to feed its men and thus a continuation of the tithes in Sicily would resolve this need. It has been contended that the system was most likely born of out of the notion it made sense merely to continue agricultural tithes and continue a taxation system that had self-evidenced success and unprecedented levels of prosperity historically. Rome's decision to integrate the already existing systems such as Heiro's tax regime aided in the construction of their own image in the eyes of the Sicilian people, as through their conservation of the past they constantly reminded the Sicilians of the generosity of the conqueror. Thus the integration of Sicilian taxation systems, into the Roman taxation method can be seen in differing ways. Drawing on Cicero's In Verrem, it is apparent that he characterises this creation of law under respect of heritage and culture. However historians have also countered that this must be considered against the backdrop of the benefits this held for Rome, in acting as a stabilising and self serving tool.  Comparison with other Roman taxation systems  The Sicilian provincial taxation system was in many ways unique and differs from taxation methods employed in other provinces. For instance, the Tribune Gaius Gracchus introduced a grain tithe to the province of Asia in 123. However, unlike in Sicily, the tithe contracts were not leased out to local contractors by the Quaestor within the province. Instead, the Asian tithe contracts were leased out by the censors in Rome to companies of Roman tax-collectors. Later, Julius Caesar abolished the leasing of tax-collection contracts in Rome, and instead placed responsibility for raising the tax in the hands of the provincial communities.Lintott, A. W. 1993. Imperium Romanum: politics and administration. London: Routledge. p. 77 This change was motivated by the prevalence of extortion by the tax-collectors. Each city would raise the amount required by whatever means they determined, which would then contribute to a joint payment by the entire province.Dio Cass. 42.6 Grain tithes continued to be exacted from Asia until at least the reign of the emperor Nero, however at some point later on it was replaced with a monetary tax based on both the quantity and quality of land, rather than the yield. Taxation in other Roman provinces often involved the exaction of a fixed sum called the stipendiarum,Cic. Verr. 2.3.13 in general it was up to the community to raise the sum by whatever means they determined, and then hand it over to the provincial governor.Lintott, A. W. 1993. Imperium Romanum: politics and administration. London: Routledge. p. 78 The stipendiarum could consist of grain, money, or sometimes both. The provinces of Spain are known to have been taxed in this manner after the rates of taxation were fixed by the governor T. Gracchus in 180, and the 600,000 denarii exacted by M. Marcellus from the Celtiberians in 151-2 is thought to represent the regular payment made in that region.Lintott, A. W. 1993. Imperium Romanum: politics and administration. London: Routledge. pp. 71-72 The main difference between the stipendiarum and the grain tithe of Sicily, was that seeing as the stipendiarum was a fixed sum which remained the same from year to year, the amount taxed was not determined by the crops' yield and other such factors.

The Val Russein includes some of the highest mountains in the canton of Graub√ºnden outside the Bernina Range. The highest mountain is the T√∂di (also named Piz Russein) with a height of 3,614 metres above sea level. Other high summits overlooking the valley are Piz Urlaun (3,359 m), D√ºssi (3,256 m) and Piz Cambrialas (3,208 m). The Val Russein is connected to the canton of Uri by the Fuorcla Cavadiras (2,609 m) and to the canton of Glarus by the Sandpass (2,781 m). A small hydroelectric dam is located at Barcuns Dadens, at an elevation of 1,362 metres. At the bottom of the valley, the river is crossed by a road bridge and a rail viaduct.

In his Master's theses Med makt i bagasjen - En analyse av politikerelitens yrkesmobilitet (With power in the luggage - An analysis of occupational mobility of politicians), he analysed the tendency of politicians to change careers from politics to PR. Moxnes concluded that characteristics such as socioeconomic background and education have little direct effect on the probability of transition to high-earning jobs. Instead, according to Moxnes, this probability is influenced by political capital. He did not rule out that socioeconomic backgrounds and education indirectly affect occupational mobility, because high education or high socioeconomic status of parents make it more likely to get jobs which permit accumulation of the political capital. = Leader of Red Youth = In 2004, Moxnes became the leader of the Red Youth after having spent two years as secretary for the organization. = Politician and leader of R√∏dt = In 2010, he was elected deputy chairman of the party, and at the party's country meeting on 6 May 2012, he was elected new head after Turid Thomassen.

Favoring pseudoscientific content, the magazine addressed issues related to HIV/AIDS, AIDS denialism, alternative medicine, and themes of interest to the LGBT community. It ran from December 1992 until February 2001 and ceased publication because the editors had died of AIDS-defining clinical conditions. History Continuum was created in December 1992 by Jody Wells (12 March 1947 ‚Äì 26 August 1995) in London, United Kingdom. It ceased publication in 2001, after all the editors died from AIDS- defining clinical conditions, leaving debts of over ¬£14,000. The magazine last appeared in print in 1998 and then surfaced again in February 2001 on the Internet. It was initially published bimonthly, then began to be published seasonally. According to the magazine: Continuum promoted the idea that AIDS was a conspiracy and was not related to HIV. Wells believed that the fear of AIDS was based on homophobia, not science. Continuum claimed to be a scientific journal for those who had alternative theories about HIV/AIDS, even though it had no peer review and promoted and advertised alternative therapies such as urinotherapy. AIDS denialists often cite the articles published in this journal as a source of scientific information. In the January/February 1996 edition, the magazine began offering ¬£1,000 to the first person who could find a scientific study that showed the isolation of HIV, even though it had been isolated in 1983 by Luc Montagnier and Fran√ßoise Barr√©-Sinoussi (for which they received a Nobel Prize), and then was confirmed by Robert Gallo in 1984, demonstrating that a retrovirus they had isolated, called HTLV-III in the belief that the virus was related to the leukemia viruses of Gallo's earlier work, was the cause of AIDS. Peter Duesberg tried to claim the prize and wrote an article for the magazine in its July/August 1996 issue, but the award was rejected because it had to meet certain conditions. Immunity Resource Foundation hosts the complete library of Continuum magazine among an internet database of 120,000 similar documents . Editors Jody Wells, founder and editor-in-chief, died at the age of 48 on 26 August 1995, by Pneumocystis pneumonia, an AIDS-defining clinical condition. Huw Christie Williams was the editor-in-chief after the death of Jody Wells until shortly before his death at the age of 41 on 17 August 2001, by Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-defining clinical condition. Michael Baumgartner was the acting editor on the last edition of the magazine. At the request of Huw Christie Williams before his death, Baumgartner served as editor for what would ultimately be the final publication before the final closing of the magazine.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Abel Thomas, c1905 The East Carmarthenshire MP since 1890 was the Liberal, Abel Thomas. He died on 23 July 1912, causing the by-election. He had been the MP since holding the seat in the 1890 East Carmarthenshire by-election Previous result Candidates The Liberal candidate chosen to defend the seat was 54-year-old former Congregationalist Minister, Rev. Towyn Jones. For twenty years he had acted as agent for Abel Thomas. A local man, he was prominent in the Welsh Congregational Union and Carmarthenshire civic politics. He was an advocate of the more radical social programme being adopted by the Liberal party. Some local Liberal landowners had tried unsuccessfully to get the local association to select a more conservative and affluent candidate.Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918 The Unionists re-adopted local resident and landowner, Mervyn Lloyd Peel. He had been Chairman of East Carmarthenshire Unionist Association since 1907. He was a 56-year-old Barrister, born in Sale, Cheshire, and son of a Carmarthenshire Deputy Lieutenant. Peel was contesting the seat for third consecutive time. The Independent Labour Party re-adopted 42-year-old Dr John Henry Williams who had also stood here last time. He was a general practitioner in Burry Port, Carmarthenshire. However, the Labour Party nationally did not adopt him as a candidate on this occasion. Campaign The Labour campaign got off to a bad start when the South Wales Miners Federation decided not to back Dr Williams, forcing him to rely entirely on the local branch of the Independent Labour Party. Williams criticised the use of the military in the 1911 Llanelli railway strike.Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918 Peel, the Unionist candidate, was critical of the Parliament Act 1911 which restricted the powers of the House of Lords. The Unionist campaign received a boost when, on 8 August 1912, they gained Manchester North West from the Liberals. Result Towyn Jones Although the Liberal party share of the vote was down, the result was satisfactory, given that they had a new candidate replacing a long established incumbent. Although the Unionists did not come close to winning, they will have been encouraged by their increased share of the vote. For the Labour party to see their vote go down despite fielding an established local candidate, was a worry particularly when the Liberal government could be associated with some unpopular measures. Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the summer of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. Under the Representation of the People Act 1918 the East Carmarthenshire seat was abolished, and was replaced by the new seat of Llanelli at the general election of that year. *Jones was the endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government.

An international workshop on \\"Polarized Sources, Targets and Polarimetry\\" takes place every two years XIth International Workshop on Polarized Sources and Targets, November 14-17, 2005, Tokyo, Japan XIIth International Workshop on Polarized Sources, Targets & Polarimetry, September 10-14, 2007, New York, USA XIIIthInternational Workshop on Polarized Sources, Targets & Polarimetry, September 7 - 11, 2009, Ferrara, Italy XIVth International Workshop on Polarized Sources, Targets & Polarimetry, September 12 - 18, 2011, St. Petersburg, Russia The 2013 International Workshop on Polarized Sources, Targets & Polarimetry, September 9-13, 2013, Charlottesville, USA The 2015 International Workshop on Polarized Sources, Targets & Polarimetry, September 14-18, 2015, Bochum, Germany . The nuclear spins in the solid targets are polarized with dynamic nuclear polarization method typically in 2.5 or 5 T magnetic field . The magnetic field can be generated with a superconducting magnet filled with liquid helium. The more traditional iron magnets are not preferred due to their large mass and limited geometrical acceptance for the produced particles. The target polarization during the experiment is determined with the nuclear magnetic resonance method. The integrated enhanced NMR-signals are compared to the signals taken in superfluid helium-4 bath at well known calibration temperatures around 1 K, where the spin magnetization follows the Curie law and the nuclear polarization can be calculated from the temperature by using the Brillouin function. During the polarization build up a microwave generator is used to pump the paramagnetic centers in the target material close to the electron spin resonance frequency (about 70 GHz in 2.5 T field). In the helium-3 gas targetsThomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Hall A Helium-3 Target optical pumping is used to polarize the nucleons. In the frozen spin targets low temperatures are needed to preserve the polarization for long data taking periods (for the highest possible integrated luminosity) and to reach maximum nuclear polarization for the best figure of merit. Usually a dilution refrigerator with high cooling power is used to reach temperatures below 300 mK during the polarization build up and below 50 mK in frozen spin mode . To preserve the paramagnetic centers in the target material it has to be kept all the time at cryogenic temperatures typically below 100 K. A horizontal dilution cryostat with the possibility to load directly the target material into the helium-3/4 mixing chamber from a liquid nitrogen bath is needed for this reason. While the beam should interact with the target material scattering from the target construction materials is not desired. This leads to an additional requirement of small material budget in terms of radiation length. Thin and low density construction materials are used for this reason in the region of the incoming beam and the scattering products. The properties of a good polarized target material are high number of polarizable nucleons compared to the total amount of nucleons, high polarization degree, short polarization build up time, slow polarization loss rate in frozen spin mode, good resistance against radiation damage and easy handling of the target material. For the dynamic nuclear polarization the material has to be doped with free radicals. Two different ways are usual: chemical doping by mixing with free radicals and creation of F-centers by irradiation in an intensive electron beam. Commonly used target materials are butanol, ammonia , lithium hydrides and their deuterated counterparts. A very interesting material is hydrogen deuteride, because it has the maximal content of polarizable nucleons. High proton polarizations have been reached in a large naphthalene single crystal using optically excited triplet states of fully deuterated pentacene guest molecules at temperatures around 100 K and magnetic field of 0.3 T. Hyperpolarized carbon-13 has been studied for medical imaging applications .

He is best known for his work with British Cycling. He has published three books, The Chimp Paradox in 2012, My Hidden Chimp in 2018 and The Silent Guides in 2018. Early life Peters was born in Middlesbrough. His father worked on Tees Dock as a stevedore and his mother worked as an insurance agent. He was the middle child of three boys. He attended Grammar school having passed the scholarship entrance exams. He was not academically inclined and by self-admission would pass each academic hurdle throughout his entire career by achieving only what was necessary. He achieved eight ordinary levels and then took four Advanced level subjects in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology; the first pupil at his school to take four ‚ÄòA‚Äô level subjects. After leaving school he went to Stirling University to study Mathematics and then went on to take a Post Graduate Certificate of Education at Sheffield University, where he gained a distinction in teaching practice. He taught mathematics for several years in secondary schools and colleges. During his teaching career he undertook extensive voluntary work that spanned across organisations such as ‚ÄòHelp the Aged‚Äô, the NSPCC (working with educationally and socially disadvantaged children), the RSPCA and he also took classes at North Sea Camp for young offenders alongside work in the probation service. Peters‚Äô interest in the support for victims of crime led him to help start a victim support scheme in his town of Boston. This movement spread and resulted in the National Victims Support Scheme. Peters re-entered University to study medicine at St Mary‚Äôs Medical School, part of the University of London. During his time as an undergraduate he was the year representative in his first year, the Secretary of the students Union in his second year and became President in his third year. He won the prize for medical statistics. Whilst at St Mary‚Äôs he also directed the medical school opera and became the president of London University Athletics. He represented London University at the British University Championships where he made the final in the 200 metres. Peters was awarded colours for outstanding service to the University of London. Work = Medical and Academic Career = After graduating as a doctor he undertook several positions within hospitals and institutions across the UK in disciplines of surgery, medicine, general practice and various branches of psychiatry. He gained his membership exams for the Royal College of Psychiatrists and became a Consultant psychiatrist within the National Health Service, where he worked for twenty years. During this time he was Clinical Director of Bassetlaw District General Hospital and worked at the Special Hospital at Rampton working with patients with personality disorders. In parallel to his hospital clinical work he worked at Sheffield University as a Senior Clinical Lecturer in medicine where he became Undergraduate Dean and Professor of Psychiatry (positions which he still currently holds as of 2015). During his time at the University he gained a master's degree in Medical Education, a Post-Graduate Diploma in Sports Medicine and was awarded a Doctorate in Medicine. Peters set a precedent by being bestowed the Senate award for teaching excellence on two occasions, still a unique achievement, and represented the University at a meeting to celebrate teaching excellence at Downing Street. Peters set up the mentoring system for student support within the medical school and led on this for several years. = Work in Elite Sport = In 2001 a former student at Sheffield recommended Peters to the British Cycling team, and he moved from part-time to full-time work with the team in 2005. Peters has been recognised by Olympic cyclists Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, as having helped them in their careers. Sir Dave Brailsford has described Peters as \\"the best appointment I've ever made.\\" Peters stepped down from his role with British Cycling in April 2014 when Brailsford left his position as Performance Director. Peters has worked with Ronnie O'Sullivan since 2011 working with him when he won his 4th and 5th World Snooker Championships in 2012 and 2013. O'Sullivan has acknowledged Peters' influence and help in his continued success. After the 2012 Olympics Peters was appointed by UK Athletics to work with the country's high performance athletes. Sprinter Adam Gemili, who won gold at the 2014 European Athletics Championships in the 200 metres and silver at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in the 100 metres, attributed his ability to perform under pressure at major championships to his work with Peters. In November 2012 Peters started to work with Liverpool F.C. In March 2014 he was recruited to help the England football team.  Books  = The Chimp Paradox = Peters first book, The Chimp Paradox, was published in January 2012 and has since gone on to sell 615,000 copies in the UK (as of 31 March 2019). In the book Peters uses his 'Chimp Model' to depict the irrational, emotional areas of the brain as a chimp and the logical areas as a human. = My Hidden Chimp = Released in November 2018, My Hidden Chimp , is an educational children's book written to help children understand and manage their emotions. It has sold over 50,000 copies (as of 24 February 2019). = The Silent Guides = Released in November 2018 as a companion book to My Hidden Chimp, the book is aimed at adults, to help them understand their own mind and to support their children reading My Hidden Chimp. Other Work Peters established Chimp Management Ltd, a company which delivers consultancy and training services. He presents a video programme every 2 weeks on The Troop, a membership platform set up by Chimp Management Ltd. Athletics career Peters competes in masters athletics and has held multiple World Masters Champion titles and world records over the 100, 200 and 400 metres. He currently competes in the M65 age group.

However, scrub, woodland and neutral grassland contribute to the site's diversity. The neutral Fuller's earth clay grassland at the bottom of the slope is less flower-rich, but provides good grazing. The steep scree slope was previously woodland as demonstrated by the presence of angular Solomon's-seal, deadly nightshade, bluebell and the deep blue flowers of columbine. Numerous large ant-hills are a prominent feature of the reserve. They are made by the yellow meadow ant. In some places they may be as a high as a metre. In parts of Gloucestershire the ant hills are known as \\"emmet casts\\", \\"emmet\\" being the old English word for ant.2011, 'Nature Reserves Guide', Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, issued to celebrate its 50th Anniversary Plants and grasses The flora includes kidney vetch, pyramidal orchid, wild thyme, common rock-rose, clustered bellflower and a good population of green-winged orchids. Uncommon plants present are cut-leaved germander, slender bedstraw and wild liquorice. The limestone grassland consists largely of upright brome with tor-grass on steeper parts where site is ungrazed. The vegetation is tussocky with encroaching scrub while a shorter herb-rich sward occurs in the grazed area. The neutral grassland community has more abundant false oat-grass and cock's foot. Trees and scrub Hawthorn, blackthorn and dog-rose scrub is scattered over the reserve with some dense thickets. A small woodland is made up of beech, yew and common whitebeam. Along the southern boundary there is a strip of hazel coppice, field maple and wild cherry. Invertebrates and reptiles There are strong colonies of small blue, marbled white, dark green fritillary and green hairstreak butterflies and numerous moths, snails, spiders and tiny false scorpions. Between June and July the large blue butterfly may be seen. This became extinct in the UK in the 1970s, but has been reintroduced to the reserve. These beautiful and rare butterflies were reintroduced to the nature reserve in 2002, after being extinct in the county since the 1960s. The reintroduction is part of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology‚Äôs (CEH) Large Blue Project.'Rare Butterfly returns', Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust e-newsletter, June 2012 The steep scree slope is a good basking area for adders and common lizards. Birds Breeding birds include yellowhammer, tree pipit and redstart. Conservation Selective grazing by sheep and cattle has resulted in short and long grassy areas. The rotational grazing operates by fences breaking up the site into compartments. Scrub is hand-cleared, but song posts and thickets are left for the breeding birds. The cut-leaved germander is encouraged by the creation of its preferred open-scree habitat, and this is fenced against disturbance by rabbits. The cut-leaved germander is fully protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Walks There is a publication which details walks for recreation and observing wildlife in the Golden Valley. This includes information on Daneway Banks and four other nearby nature reserves being Three Groves Wood, Strawberry Banks SSSI, Siccaridge Wood and Sapperton Valley. The walk also includes other ancient woodland at Peyton's Grove, Oakridge village, Bakers Mill and Reservoir, Ashmeads Spring, and part of the route of the old Thames and Severn Canal.

Edith Cavell served as Assistant Matron at the hospital from 1903 to 1906. It had become known as St Leonard's Hospital by 1920 and came under the management of London County Council in 1930. It was the first hospital to receive casualties during the Blitz and then joined the National Health Service in 1948. Although the hospital was the subject of a workers‚Äô occupation aiming to keep the hospital open in July 1984, it ceased to operate a general hospital later that year.

Biography Louis was the second son of Landgrave Frederick V and his wife Caroline of Hesse-Darmstadt, a daughter of Landgrave Louis IX of Hesse-Darmstadt and Caroline of Zweibr√ºcken, \\"the Great Landgravine\\". Louis, as he was usually called, was educated together with his elder brother Frederick VI. They studied together in Geneva, and in 1788, they joined the Prussian army together. In 1793, he fought in the Battle of Pirmasens. In 1798, he was promoted to major. In 1804, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and he married Princess Augusta Amalia of Nassau-Usingen, daughter of Frederick Augustus, Duke of Nassau. This \\"dynastic marriage\\" with the daughter of a neighbouring prince was an unhappy one, as she was in love with Count Frederick William of Bismarck. The marriage ended in divorce. Augusta Amalia married Frederick William; Louis William did not marry again. Ricarda Huch gives more details in her Count Mark and the Princes of Nassau-Usingen. A tragic biography of 1925. In 1806, he fought in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt and was taken prisoner by the French. After his release, he became major general of the infantry in K√∂nigsberg. Here, he reorganized the army in the framework of the Prussian reforms. In 1810, he was transferred to Berlin. In 1813, he fought in the German campaign with his own \\"Hesse-Homburg Brigade\\". In the Battle of Leipzig, his troops stormed the Grimma gate and he was injured. In 1813, he was promoted to lieutenant general and Supreme Commander of the Reserve Corps. During the Hundred Days, he again fought Napoleon's army. After the Second Peace of Paris, he was appointed governor of Luxembourg. Louis rarely visited Homburg. Hesse-Homburg was administered between 1828 and 1832 by Carl von Ibell. A wealthy man, Louis travelled to many European countries; however, he was always interested in the situation in his own small country. He supported the education reform Ibell was implementing, which provided for a single school system with Protestant, Catholic and Jewish students. The building for a shared school was inaugurated in 1831, and it is now called (\\"Landgrave Louis School\\"). He also promoted the creation of a spa in Bad Homburg. He renovated the springs in the town, and added a small spa hall, which today houses a casino. The district of Meisenheim joined the German Customs Union in 1829; the rest of Hesse-Homburg joined in 1835. The July Revolution of 1830 sparked unrest in Hesse-Homurg. The army mutinied and several youths from Homburg participated in the Frankfurter Wachensturm. In 1838, he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his career as a Prussian officer. He paid a two-week visit to Homburg and returned to Luxembourg, where he died on 19 January 1839. He was buried in the crypt of Bad Homburg Castle.

IPTO Director Lawrence Roberts, who would serve as the conference's chair, decided that the ICCC would be the ideal place to showcase the capabilities of ARPANET. With the help of MIT professor Al Vezza, Khan enlisted help from across the country of scientists and students working with ARPANET. A Terminal Interface Processor was installed at the Hilton, connected to ARPANET by a dedicated phone line installed by AT&T;, and then connected to dozens of terminals set up on the floor. The conference began with a VIP reception on the 22nd before opening on the 24th. The ARPANET demo was a \\"mind-blowing\\" success, connecting attendees to systems across the nation and abroad to engage them in a variety of activities, including interacting with an air traffic control system and playing computer chess.

The information consultant cultivates active partnerships with students and scholars, collaborating on the design of meaningful learning experiences for students and providing relevant information. Elements of information literacy and scholarly information are integrated into the consulting relationship. To remain relevant, librarians and information professionals are supposed to become effective consultants. By engaging scholars in an active consulting program, librarians, and as a result the library as a whole, are actively integrated into the scholarly activities of the academic institution. Librarians and libraries that do not become effectively networked on campuses via consulting will be less relevant and will not be included in scholarly communications and research processes. This will affect status as well as budgets, available resources, and services.Frank, D.G., Raschke, G.K. , Wood, J. and Yang, J.Z. (2001).

Fields of work =Human rights= The organisation trains journalists and citizen journalists and gives them the tools and knowledge to analyse and report on human rights issues effectively. It has been providing support to independent media and helped them to preserve access to independent information. A current project in Kyrgyzstan, for instance, supports the reforming of the media and helps journalists to strengthen their conflict- sensitive reporting skills. In December 2008, Internews organised Every Human Has Rights media awards ceremony during the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights in Paris. It gathered distinguished personalities such as members of the Elders, Irish President Mary Robinson and U.S. President Jimmy Carter that honoured 30 journalists and citizen journalists from around the world in a ceremony. / =Humanitarian response= Another field of activity is the support of two way information flows between humanitarian organisations and affected populations. In the recent past, the organisation has responded to crisis situations as in Haiti. It partners with a number of humanitarian agencies, including the Red Cross, Save the Children, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) to gather evidence about the key role that effective communication can play in the effectiveness, relevance and accountability of humanitarian response. Internews has been the beneficiary of a large grant from the Humanitarian Innovation Fund (with money from the UK‚Äôs DFID, the Swedish Foreign Ministry and the Canadian International Development Agency) for a project in Central African Republic, where it support a network of local radio stations providing real-time mapping of developing crises. =Environmental protection= Within the field of environmental protection, the organisation has been running the Earth Journalism Network (EJN) together with the Internews Network. EJN establishes networks of environmental journalists in countries where they don‚Äôt exist, and builds their capacity where they do, through training workshops and fellowship programs, the development of briefing materials and online tools, support for production and distribution, and the provision of small grants. =Conflict and stabilisation= Its work also includes the training and monitoring of media professionals in Conflict Sensitive Journalism in conflict-affected countries. This involves supporting media productions to promote conflict reconciliation and transitional justice, the development of new media policy and regulatory frameworks and local training capacity. In Rwanda, for instance, the organisation has supported the training of local journalists to encourage a peaceful dialogue. From 2010 to 2012, Internews Europe implemented a project in Pakistan where it has worked with communities affected by the 2010 floods. The project has given a voice to local communities through the use of local media and therefore helped to build bridges between local media, authorities and disaster-affected communities. / =Democracy and governance= The organisation's programmes also include the provision of training in political and investigative journalism, support in developing media codes of conduct and locally driven media monitoring during election campaigns and around other politically sensitive issues. This is because it is believed that a free, accountable and independent media can play a crucial role in supporting democratic development. In Libya, for instance, it organised the training of media professionals and journalists on professional election coverage as part of a project aimed at strengthen the newly independent media emerging after Gadhafi‚Äôs regime. In Zimbabwe, Internews Europe accompanied the development of Freedom Fone, an interactive information exchange service that uses mobile phone technology. With the help of this device Zimbabwean citizens could share their views and ask questions on the creation of the new Constitution which follows on from the establishment of the National Unity Government in February 2009.

The monoplane is an open framed aircraft with wire-braced fabric covered wings and conventional landing gear, powered by a Detroit aero engine. The fuselage frame, spars, and ribs are made of wood. Roll control was performed with wing-warping. Operational history Hartman made one takeoff attempt from the Burlington, Iowa golf course, reaching ten feet in altitude.

It is a sequel to his 2008 novel World Made by Hand. Set in the fictional town of Union Grove, New York, the novel follows many of the same cast of characters from the previous novel as they navigate a world stripped of its modern comforts, ravaged by terrorism, epidemics, and the economic upheaval of peak oil. Following the characters from the first novel, the plot centers around Jasper Copeland, the eleven-year-old son of Union Grove's doctor. After his puppy is crushed by a stallion belonging to the New Faith Church, Copeland poisons the stallion with opium and runs away. His journey sets other characters in motion, mainly Brother Jobe, the leader of the New Faith Church and, to a lesser degree, Robert Earle, Rev. Loren Holder and Jasper's father, Dr. Copeland. It also introduces Perry Talisker, a local hermit, and Barbara Maglie, the witch of the title. Set a few months after the events of A World Made by Hand, the citizens of Union Grove are living on the tail end of a national catastrophe, with their community slowly falling apart from neglect and natural decay. Much of the rest of the nation seems to be falling apart, with nuclear blasts in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., cities devolving and a fractured United States. Unlike the previous novel, the larger world does not much intrude as the entire story is set around the rural county. Kunstler explores themes of local and sustainable living. In interviews, Kunstler describes his imaginary world as an \\"enlightened nineteenth century.\\" The overarching premise, however, is a stark look into the future at the dire consequences of the poor American system of urban planning, and the complete lack of workability the contemporary suburban arrangement possesses without the continuous input of inexpensive and abundant energy to maintain its infrastructure. This has been the core theme of Kunstler's nonfiction works, including the Geography of Nowhere (1993) and The Long Emergency. Characters Jasper Copeland - The eleven-year-old protagonist and son of Union Grove's doctor. After his puppy is crushed by a stallion belonging to the New Faith Church, Copeland poisons the stallion with opium and runs away. He plans to go to nearby Glens Falls, a larger town to the north, and become a doctor like his father. Along the way he meets Billy Bones, a bandit who insists the boy be his \\"protege\\". At first Copeland stays with Bones to get to Glens Falls, but soon realizes the man is homicidal. Repeated attempts to escape fail. When Billy Bones tries to rape the witch Barbara Maglie, Jasper saves her, killing Bones with a knife. Copeland is eventually caught by the New Faith Church, who were looking for him after his poisoning of their stallion, but when he performs an emergency appendectomy on Brother Jobe they are square. Copeland returns to his home to be an apprentice to his father. Billy Bones - A self described bandit, he insists on singing a ballad about himself while robbing his victims. Quick to club people to death with the butt of his pistol or cut with the blade of his knife, he leaves a path of death. He adopts Jasper Copeland as his \\"protege\\" and then forces the boy to remain with him long after Copeland realizes Bones is psychotic and repeatedly tries to escape. In Glens Falls, Bones kills \\"Luke the Duke\\", the self-styled head of the town, and Angel, a transvestite Bones frequents. While attempting to rape Barbara Maglie, he is stabbed and killed by Jasper Copeland. In the book's epilogue it is clear the \\"Ballad of Billy Bones\\" lives on in local legend. Robert Earle - Earle worked in computers until things changed, and now works as a respected carpenter. A fiddle player in the town's various musical groups, he is the line between the past and the new age; of old democratic values and more dystopian forces struggling for control. His wife died in a flu epidemic and his son, Daniel, aged 19, left to see what happened to the rest of the world and has not been heard from since. In the previous novel, the arrival of the New Faith Church and a murder by one of Karp's men makes him realize their town's need to be more proactive in taking care of business as a community. He is elected mayor and attempts to restore law and order to the town. A widow and her daughter come to live with him after their house burns down, and Earle accepts that they are now his family. He continues this role in this novel. Reverend Loren Holder - Pastor of the traditional white steepled First Congregational church in Union Grove, his thoughts dwell in the past while he tries to keep up the town's spirits. He is Earle's best friend. In the previous book, his wife shared a bed weekly with Earle, an arrangement no one speaks with each other about but that ended when Earle took in the widow and child. Holder has been unable to get an erection for years, which lead to his wife's and Earle's arrangement. Suicidal and depressed, Holder visits Barbara Maglie, the witch of the title, having been told by Dr. Copeland that she might be able to help with her \\"magic\\". When Earle is made mayor, Holder is named the town's constable. After his visit with Maglie, in his role as constable, he rescues four boys who were being sold by a rural store owner. Upon returning home he takes the boys in and finds a future with his wife. Barbara Maglie - She's the sole owner of a luxurious house in the village of Hebron, north of Union Grove, and is the story's eponymous witch. She is vexingly beautiful, has a vast knowledge of potions and can predict the future. She explains her bounty by saying \\"people bring me things.\\" When Earle and Dr. Copeland spend the night, they have fantastical, erotic dreams that seem to advertise her services. Later, Holder confesses he is impotent. Dr. Copeland then suggests a visit that proves successful. Billy Bones tries to rape her but Jasper Copeland stops him. Brother Jobe - The leader of a religious group called the New Faith Church, which comes to Union Grove fleeing unrest in Virginia. His flock takes over the abandoned high school and has a \\"can do\\" attitude, shaking the town that is slowly falling apart from neglect. Confident, the sect is mysterious and seems to embrace a punishing view of God. After Jasper Copeland poisons the New Faith Church's stallion, Brother Jobe and two of his men track him seeking justice, finding Bones' victims along the way. Copeland winds up saving Jobe's life by performing an emergency appendectomy. Dr. Copeland - Jasper's father and the town doctor. When Jasper's dog is killed, he asks Brother Jobe if he can bring it back from the dead. Jobe says he cannot. A man of science, Copeland is unsure of what to put faith in and turns to alcohol. His dependency gets worse as he worries about his son. Unwilling at first to turn to the New Faith Church's men, who are expert trackers, he and Earle look as far as Barbara Maglie's house. After a night of provocative dreams, Earle and he come across a store they believe, correctly, is trading in young boys. He mentions both to Holder. Perry Talisker - A hermit, outdoorsman and former butcher whose wife ran away after a hard winter, he decides after looking at a poster that his fate lies in having a showdown with a catamount, a local mountain lion. After tracking them throughout the book, he kills one just as it pounces on Jasper Copeland. At the same instant he plunges his knife into it, the catamount kills him and they die together. Stephen Bullock - A wealthy landowner from an old landowner family, he runs a two thousand acre spread along the Hudson River. In the past, his land was part of the town, but now it is its own village, set up much like a traditional English manor. He has vision and has adjusted with the times, moving towards self-sufficiency. Reception Reviews of the novel were largely positive. Publishers Weekly writes, \\"In the sequel to his bestselling World Made by Hand, Kunstler delivers another grim and suspenseful novel.\\" New York Journal of Books writes, \\"The Witch of Hebron is a fast-moving and enjoyable read for the warm days and chilly nights of autumn, when you are staying in a rural B&B; reading by candlelight, or watching the leaves change on a red and yellow river bluff, drinking a thermos of hot apple cider.\\" Still, while reviewers like Ed Park of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the book, most had reservations and felt it uneven in its storytelling and impact.

Early life and career Born in Butte, Montana, Hart received his A.B. from Harvard College in 1926 and attended Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review and received an LL.M. in 1930 and an S.J.D. in 1931.See also . Following work for then-Professor Felix Frankfurter, Hart clerked for Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and then returned to Harvard Law School, where he was a fixture until his death at 64. An \\"ardent supporter of the New Deal\\" and of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, World War II and the Cold War led Hart to evolve \\"from a dedicated progressive into a theorist of social stability, cultural consensus, and institutional balance.\\" That evolution led Hart to seek institutional solutions to protect the rule of law from overreaching by Congress and the executive. That approach became the inspiration for the new \\"Legal Process\\" school of American jurisprudence. Important works and key principles =The legal process= The legal process school was first given definition by Hart's manuscript of the same name, co-authored with Albert M. Saacks. Originally planned for publication by Foundation Press in 1956, the manuscript was organized into seven chapters, with 55 \\"problems\\" which guided the student through Hart and Sacks proposed approach to important American law cases. Despite being widely circulated in manuscript form, which itself went through four major editions, the Legal Process was not published in book form by Foundation Press until 1994. The manuscript editions, however, were widely circulated and very influential among the professoriate, many of whom used it as the foundation for courses at Harvard Law and other institutions. Together with The Federal Courts, discussed below, The Legal Process within twenty years came to be viewed as \\"the foundation text of the legal theory known as 'legal process.'\\" An exploration of law made both by courts and outside the courtroom, scholars have identified three key themes from the work itself: (1) Institutional competence, (2) Statutory interpretation, and (3) principled decisionmaking.See generally . Institutional competence \\"This perspective stresses that Hart and Sacks 'believed that it was possible to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate exercises of official power while simultaneously transcending the centuries-old debate between ... the 'is' and the 'ought'.' The Legal Process demonstrated that lawyers did not have to engage in substantive moral or political reasoning, since 'there could be a kind of natural, functional correlation between different kinds of disputes and different kinds of institutions, so that the categories of dispute could be matched up with the kinds of institutional procedures corresponding to them.' Thus, by adopting the value pluralism of pragmatists like John Dewey, legal process was able to argue - contra the realists - that the analysis of legal validity is not reducible to political ideology.\\", citing Gary Peller, Neutral Principles in the 1950s, 21 U. Mich. J.L. Ref. 561 (1988). Statutory interpretation Hart and Sacks argued for a shift away from the application of substantive, precedential rules, critiqued by the realists, in favor of application of rules of precedential process. \\"Granting that substantive fairness is a matter of ideology, the doctrinal approach holds that fairness will result, regardless or even in spite of the judges' biases, if methods of judging which all concede to be fair are followed scrupulously.\\" Hart and Sacks \\"believed that judges should use various tools of construction -- including the overall policy evinced by the statutory text, the legislative history, and public knowledge . . . -- to determine what 'purpose ought to be attributed to the statute' and to interpret the words 'to carry out the purpose as best it can.'\\" These procedural rules become a way to distinguish between adjudication and ad hoc legislation, the first of which is the role of the courts. \\"This view of statutes depended critically on the presumption that procedures existed that could identify the purposes selected by the legislature without actually substantively evaluating those purposes.\\" In their famous phrase, judges \\"should assume, unless the contrary unmistakably appears, that the legislature was made up of reasonable persons pursuing reasonable purposes reasonably.\\", citing Hart and Sacks, The Legal Process, tenth ed. 1958, at 1378. This approach would later be challenged by the \\"new textualism\\" approach advocated by Justice Scalia and others. Principled decisionmaking One of the key tenets of Hart's thought was \\"principled decisionmaking,\\" or the idea that \\"decisions [must] be based on premises of general applicability, otherwise they would be ad hoc or 'legislative'\\" and that the adjudication must be neutral, \\"thereby claiming the allegiance of litigants through a tacit arrangement of reciprocity....\\" Heavily influenced by Justice Benjamin Cardozo's approach to adjudication,. See also, Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921). \\"principled\\" decisionmaking thus transcends the immediate outcome of the case at the bar, and through appeal to neutral adjudication principles, \\"thereby claim[s] the allegiance of litigants through a tacit arrangement of reciprocity.\\" Principled decisionmaking as an idea would later be fleshed out more fully by Wechsler,Herbert Wechsler, Toward Neutral Principles of Constitutional Law, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (1959). in Judge Learned Hand's criticism of the activist Warren Court,See, e.g., Learned Hand, The Bill of Rights 46 (Harvard U., 1958). and which remains an important and debated concept in modern jurisprudence.See, e.g., Barry Friedman, Neutral Principles: A Retrospective, 50 Vand. L. Rev. 503, 536 (1997). Other scholars have tied Hart's requirement of principled reasoning to the wider \\"postwar liberal project associated with Robert Dahl and John Rawls\\" as well as with the work of John Hart Ely and Ronald Dworkin. =Hart's dialogue= In 1953, Hart addressed the question of Congress's power over federal jurisdiction in his very influential article, \\"The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts.\\" Included in his Federal Courts, which was published later the same year, this article has come to be known as \\"Hart's Dialogue\\" and argues for the proposition (\\"Hart‚Äôs postulate\\") that one always has access to a constitutional court to rule on: 1) claims of entitlement to/ sufficiency of judicial process; and 2) claims that rights are violated and not vindicated. While this is not a right to any particular remedy, or any particular court, it is a right to some remedy, somewhere, even if that requires the federal courts to fall back on their general Constitutional grants of power, or for recourse by the individual to the state courts. =Federal Courts and the Federal System= Hart was a frequent collaborator with Herbert Wechsler, with whom he authored Federal Courts and the Federal System, \\"the most influential casebook in Constitutional law\\" and also \\"the book most frequently cited by the Supreme Court both generally and in constitutional opinions.\\"See also (\\"probably the most important and influential casebook ever written\\"). Federal Courts \\"define[d] what has come to be one of the most important schools of legal thought in late twentieth-century America, typically described as 'the legal process school.'\\" In broad brushstrokes, the school \\"focuses primary attention on who is, or ought, to make a given legal decision, and how that decision is, or ought to be made.... The question what is or ought to be the substantive law governing citizen behavior in a given area is no longer the sole, or even the dominant, object of legal analysis. Rather, the legal process analysis illuminates how substantive norms governing primary conduct shape, and are in turn shaped by, organizational structure and procedural rules.\\" In response to the legal realism critique that judges invariably make law, Hart and Wechsler focused the attention of the emerging legal process school on the question of \\"what kinds of law could [judges] legitimately make, and when?\\" Hart and Wechsler's initial response was that, if there may be widespread disagreement on what the substantive law is, or ought to be, in a given field, there may at least be agreement as to where institutionally those decisions should be made, and under what conditions or set of rules (such as jurisdiction, procedure, etc.). The role of the courts, particularly with respect to the Constitution, \\"is essentially a common law function, arising from the court's common law process respecting litigants.\\" Thus, \\"[b]y paying strict attention to second-order rules allocating power between federal courts and other institutions, the legal process theorists sought to specify with precision the boundaries and purposes of federal judicial power. Once these boundaries were specified, federal judicial decisionmaking could be both legitimated and restrained.\\" Among innovations introduced by The Federal Courts was the idea of a federal \\"protective jurisdiction,\\" or the idea that Congress could extend federal jurisdiction to cases implicating a federal interest, \\"even in the absence of both diversity jurisdiction and a claim based on federal law.\\" Influence Hart's influence on the courts, the academy and the bar is notable both for its depth and longevity. =Influence on the courts= Hart's relationship with Justice Frankfurter both before and following the latter's elevation to the Supreme Court was well known. Indeed, the first edition of Federal Courts was dedicated to Frankfurter. And, on more than one occasion, Justice Frankfurter noted his appreciation for insights provided by his former pupil.Paul A. Fruend. Henry M. Hart, Jr.: In Memoriam. 82 Harv. L. Rev. 1595, 1597 (quoting one letter from Justice Frankfurter to Hart \\"Unlike so many things one reads, it has not only given me pleasure and enlightenment but its stimulus to reflection will not have ceased with the reading of it. I shall duly ponder on the spanking you have given me...\\") Perhaps through the intermediation of his one-time professor, Hart's work, and particularly The Federal Courts, quickly became a standard reference for the Supreme Court. Lower courts were also impacted by Hart's thinking, particularly on the topic of federal jurisprudence. Hart's construction divided the judiciary into two parts, which he dubbed the \\"logic of federalism.\\" \\"The federal courts should serve as the authoritative voice of federal law and national interests, and state courts should serve as the authoritative voices of state law and local interests.\\" This construction would impress later members of the bar, including the very influential Judge Henry Friendly. =Influence on the academy= Hart's impact on academia is equally important, particularly his impact on his contemporaries. One influential contemporary, Lon Fuller, as early as the 1940s acknowledged his indebtedness to the influence of HartNeil Duxbury, Faith in Reason: The Process Tradition in American Jurisprudence. 15 Cardazo L. Rev. 601, 633 (1993). and was himself influential on Hart's thinking and work.: \\"[Hart and Sacks] cite to Fuller so frequently, and use his terminology so naturally, that there is good reason to believe that Hart and Sacks self-consciously adopted his view of adjudication.\\" Less well-known, yet equally important, is the connection between Hart's Legal Process work and the later work of his contemporary and sometime-fellow at Harvard, Professor H.L.A. Hart. Recently, however, Professor Michael C. Dorf has argued \\"that soft positivism, understood as a synthesis of the H.L.A. Hart/ [Ronald]Dworkin debate, entails a view about the institutional allocation of power remarkably close to the one articulated by (Henry) Hart and Sacks in the Legal Process.\\"Michael C. Dorf. \\"Legal Indeterminacy and Institutional Design. 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 875, 910(2003). Hart's impact continues to be felt. Among those influenced by Hart's \\"intellectual leadership\\" was Paul J. Mishkin, who \\"taught from, and was influenced by\\" and then would go on to edit the third edition of Federal Courts, and who would in turn be very influential on the legal process movement.Robert C. Post and Neil S. Siegel. Theorizing the Law/Politics Distinction: Neutral Principles, Affirmative Action, and the Enduring Legacy of Paul Mishkin. 95 Cal. L. Rev. 1473, 1474. Similarly, Michael C. Dorf, Professor at Columbia Law School, has continued to argue for a \\"return to Hart and Sacks's commitment to a legal decisionmaking process that is deeply informed about the institutions with which legal actors interact....\\"Michael C. Dorf. Legal Indeterminacy and Institutional Design. 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 875, 882 (2003). Other modern academics influenced by Hart in the legal process school include Philip Bobbitt, Alexander Bickel and Robert Bork. Philip Bobbitt cites Hart's process approach to constitutional law as archetypal of one of two strands of the \\"doctrinal\\" mode of constitutional jurisprudence, the other being the substantive approach taken by the American Law Institute's Restatements and Model Code efforts of the late 1950s-60s. Another analysis points to a separate split in the legal process school between the legal process approach outlined by Hart and Sacks and a later iteration, \\"defined by Herbert Wechsler, Alexander Bickel, and Robert Bork\\" which changed \\"Hart and Sacks's theory of law into a conservative theory of adjudication. The later legal process scholars' interpretation of Hart and Sacks relied on a controversial form of moral skepticism that assumed that legal norms cannot command judges to enforce moral principles because moral principles did not have any cognizable existence.\\" =Influence on the bar= Finally, Hart's influence has extended beyond the academy to the bar itself through the generation of lawyers trained by him at Harvard and those influenced by his casebook and other works.See, e.g., . Amar points to the large number of articles published in the early 1950s at Columbia and Harvard on the topic of federal jurisprudence, as well as the large numbers of \\"student editors on the editorial boards [at these schools] who went on to become teachers of federal jurisdiction, legal process, and constitutional law\\" as an important indicia of the influence and \\"intellectual leadership\\" Hart and Wechsler had on their respective institutions and, by extension, on American jurisprudence. Death Hart died in March of 1969 after several years of declining health at age 64. \\"HENRY M HART JR., HARVARD TEACHER; Professor of Law, 64, Dead -- Authority on Judiciary,' The New York Times, MARCH 25, 1969 Selected bibliography *H.

History The army was formed even before the Congress Poland, in 1814, and was based on the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw. Its creation was confirmed by the Constitution of the Congress Kingdom. It took part in the November Uprising against the Russians. The uprising begun when a group of young officers tried, unsuccessfully, to assassinate Grand Duke Constantine. The defeat of the uprising in 1831 marked the end of the existence of a regular Polish army for almost a century. It was abolished with the new constitution of 1832, the Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland, which incorporated the army into the Russian Army. Culture and training The Army retained Polish uniforms. It was reorganized into a Russian army model, with infantry and cavalry divisions, artillery brigades and batteries, and an engineering corps. A regiment of grenadiers and cavalry rifleman were also formed. Obligatory military service was set at 10 years, with the option of buying one's time out. The Army was well trained, with a new cadet school in Kalisz, a number of podchorƒÖ≈ºy training schools, and a higher military school in Warsaw. The cost of maintaining the army was close to 50% of the Kingdom's budget. Composition and size Notable Polish commanders of the Army included Ignacy PrƒÖdzy≈Ñski and J√≥zef Bem, and General Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski. Its nominal commander-in-chief was the Russian Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia, although for most purposes the Army was commanded by a Military Council. The peacetime army was 28,000-30,000 strong (sources vary). During the November Uprising, it was expanded to 100,000. Of that, about 57,000 could be seen as a qualified, first-line troops. Before the Uprising, the Army was composed of two infantry divisions with three brigades each, two cavalry divisions with two brigades each, and two artillery brigades (one cavalry and one infantry). Each infantry brigade was about 3,600 strong, each cavalry brigade was about half that size.

Goals  The primary goals of foundation are: * Protection of the human rights in the surveillance society; * Initiating and enhancing the level of public debate over the mechanisms and technologies enabling surveillance of the society and further usage of data collected on citizens/entities; * Involving in research initiatives concerned with the development of the surveillance society and analysis of the social consequences of that phenomenon; * Involvement in educational projects, which will raise the popular knowledge of human rights and freedoms, as well as enhancing of public awareness over the dangers surrounding development of the surveillance society.  Activities  The foundation organizes, maintains or takes part in the following activities: * monitoring how improper use of modern technology by the government or commercial entities like multinational corporations can threaten civil rights and liberties; * analyzing current and proposed surveillance and modern technology-related legislation both in Poland and the EU; * studying whether proposed legislation does not encroach on information autonomy, does not lead to social exclusion or human rights abuse; * assessing the risks related to the development of modern surveillance society technology in Poland; * taking action when the risks materialize in the form of law violation, abuse of power or an increase in social tensions; * provoking a public discussion on the threats and problems related to the development of a surveillance society both in Poland and in the world.  Name of the foundation  The name of the foundation is a reference to Jeremy Bentham's concept of a special prison, the Panopticon; in this prison a guard can constantly monitor the activities of the inmates from a central surveillance station in the building while remaining unseen, the idea behind this solution is that it would prompt the inmates into auto-censorship; it would force them to control their own behavior because of fear that they might be watched. The concept of Panopticon was developed further by Michel Foucault who extrapolated the concept on society as a whole. The French thinker claimed that we no longer need to build the Panopticon or be prisoners in order to be affected by constant and omnipresent surveillance. A modern society can be perceived as the Panopticon on its own, with each of us being subject to its constant control.  Structure  The foundation is governed by the council and the board. The board consists of two members: Katarzyna Szymielewicz and Ma≈Çgorzata Szuma≈Ñska. The board takes advice from the Program Council, which consists of the following members: dr. Ewa Charkiewicz, dr. Dominika D√∂rre-Nowak, barrister Maciej ≈ölusarek, prof. Roman Wieruszewski, Monika P≈Çatek and J√≥zef Halbersztadt.  Interventions  The first intervention of the Panoptykon Foundation took the form of campaign against compulsory personalization of the ‚Äúcity cards‚Äù in Warsaw ‚Äì cards which, when charged via proper payment allowed the bearer to make unlimited use of the Warsaw's public transportation system for a set amount of time. The Panoptykon Foundation demanded an alternative solution for those who were reluctant to share their personally identifiable information with Warsaw's Department of Public Transport (ZTM). The demands had backing on legal grounds, fe. ZTM's demands were questionable when confronted with the Polish privacy laws. At the same time the foundation started a public campaign ‚ÄúMam Ciƒô ‚Äì bo Muszƒô‚Äù (‚ÄúI have you ‚Äì because I‚Äôm forced to‚Äù), encouraging the personalization's opponents to express themselves by requesting a city card with a protest-themed graphic design printed on it. The campaign was partly successful. Part of the city council, with help from the foundation's legal experts, prepared a project to reintroduce personal tickets that would not be registered in ZTM's databases. Support gathered for the project was also large enough to make the City Council prioritize it in the council sessions. Ultimately, however, the project did not make it to the voting stage. The foundation was part of an NGO coalition opposed to the proposal of introducing a List Of Forbidden Websites and Services. The foundation was a member of the group responsible for formulating demands and representing the coalition during meetings with the government (also present during the 5 February 2010 meeting of PM Donald Tusk with the Internet users). The coalition's efforts and the campaign it mounted prompted the government to abandon the project. The coalition has not dismantled and still campaigns for systematic improvements in the law that would guarantee the security of basic rights in the Internet. In 2011 the foundation opposed compulsory gynecological examination for women as well as proposed legislation changes related to the educational information system and health care information system. The foundation took action against the installation of microphone- equipped cameras in M≈Çawa and the monitoring system in a swimming pool facility in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The foundation also takes action against compulsory data retention, website blocking, the ACTA treaty or the PNR treaty (treaty on retention and sharing of airline passengers‚Äô personal data)  The Panoptykon Seminars  In the fall 2009 ‚Äì summer 2011 period the foundation had organized public monthly meetings dedicated to the modern social surveillance solutions. The following subjects were discussed during the meetings: visual monitoring systems, medical data gathering, employee control at the workplace, consolidation of public databases, Internet surveillance, control over poverty, telecommunications data retention or surveillance in education facilities. In July 2011 the foundation organized a meeting with David Lyon, a renowned scholar dedicated to exploring the concept of the surveillance society. Prof. Lyons discussed multiple aspects of modern surveillance and its effects with Polish social scientists, journalists and thinkers.  Publications  In the year 2011 the foundation had issued two reports: ‚ÄûInternet and the basic rights. A brief overview of current regulatory issues‚Äù and ‚ÄúSurveillance 2011. A summary.‚Äù The first report collects regulatory issues in the field of basic rights on the Internet; it helps to recognize basic challenges in regulation and explores several possible ways in which the regulation might develop. The other report focuses on current issues that highlight challenges and tensions related to modern surveillance practices: visual monitoring, telecommunications data retention and sharing, the sharing of information between various government services of different nations and the information systems of public health care and education providers. The report also explains the concept of a surveillance society and highlights its potential effects on basic rights and liberties.  Finances  In 2009 the foundation operated without any funding and functioned thanks to the volunteer support. In 2010 the foundation due to statutory activities had an income of 230,036.60 PLN and reached 69,919.57 PLN in expenses resulting from statutory activities. The main sources of income were restricted grants from: The Batory Foundation (123,000 PLN), The Internet Society (US$10,000) and The Open Society Institute (US$75,000).

Background and education Henry Hobart's father was George Hobart, 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire, a fairly unenthusiastic Member of the British House of Commons, initially as a Grenville Whig, from 1754 until 1780 and briefly secretary to the British embassy in Saint Petersburg.History of Parliament Online: Members 1754-1780 - HOBART, Hon. George (1731-1804) - Author: John Brooke He succeeded his half-brother as Earl of Buckinghamshire in 1793. Henry Hobart's mother was Albinia Bertie, daughter of Lord Vere Bertie (died 1768), younger son of Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Hobart was the youngest of eight surviving children. He was born early in 1774 and baptised on 9 February in the parish church at Nocton, Lincolnshire.FamilySearch Community Trees He was educated at Westminster School and at Christ's College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1793. He graduated as MA in 1797. He was to become a Doctor of Divinity in 1816. Ecclesiastical career Hobart was ordained deacon at Winchester in June 1797 and priest in February 1798. As the son of an earl he had many avenues of preferment open to him, largely exploiting family and political connections. He was to obtain numerous positions and benefices, many of them held in plurality in places far apart, a practice that was not significantly restricted until the Pluralities Act of 1850. By this process he could acquire a relatively large income. He was not required to prove his worth as a curate but went straight into remunerative and responsible positions. Almost as soon as he was ordained to the priesthood, Hobart became rector of Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire. In 1801, he became rector also of the nearby parish of Edgcote. Both of these rectories he held until 1815, being appointed prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral in 1804, a post he held until 1816. In 1815, he was appointed to three lucrative livings in one year: Vicar of Nocton, a parish in the gift of his family; Rector of St Dionis Backchurch in the City of London, a post he held until 1828; and Rector of Great Haseley, Oxfordshire. In 1816, Hobart reached the pinnacle of his success as a clergyman with his appointment as Dean of Windsor. This made him spiritual head of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, a chapel royal and royal peculiar, essentially the monarch's private chapel. He was to hold this deanery until his death in 1848, serving four monarchs: George III, George IV, William IV and Queen Victoria. The deanery carried with it the post of Register of the Order of the Garter, which is based at the chapel. As dean, Hobart had the ear of the monarch. However, he seems not to have built up any great influence.Victoria County History - Staffordshire: Vol. 3, Chapter 38: The College of St. Peter, Wolverhampton. This may be due to a certain insensitivity or lack of tact. When Victoria gave birth to the future Edward VII in November 1841, Hobart congratulated her on \\"thus saving us from the incredible curse of a female succession.\\"All Saints, Nocton, website: History Even after his appointment at Windsor, Hobart acquired more livings. From 1823 to 1842 he was vicar of Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, and from 1828 he was Vicar of Wantage, then in Berkshire. By a custom dating to the late 15th century, the Deanery of Windsor brought with it the Deanery of Wolverhampton, another royal peculiar, outside the supervision of the local Diocese of Lichfield. St Peter's Collegiate Church was the centre of a large parish, extending far into the Black Country and rural Staffordshire. However, the deanery and prebends were virtual sinecures, as the parish had long been used to absentee clergy and the work was done by poorly paid curates. The deanery lands brought Hobart ¬£600 a year, mainly because of the mineral wealth underlying them. However, public opinion was changing and the 1830s brought a series of reforming governments. The Wolverhampton deanery became synonymous with clerical corruption and negligence: the small spiritual contribution of the clergy was contrasted with the revenues they took out. The quarrelsome behaviour of Dr. Oliver, Hobart's Perpetual Curate in the parish, further alienated opinion. In 1836 the Ecclesiastical Commission was established, charged with reviewing and redistributing Church of England revenues. This soon produced a plan of reform, embodied in legislation, variously termed the Cathedrals Act 1840 and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840, but actually entitled An Act to carry into effect, with certain Modifications, the Fourth Report of the Commissioners of Ecclesiastical Duties and Revenues. Section 21 decreed that the deanery should be suppressed, along with those of Middleham, Heytesbury and Brecon.Phillimore and Phillimore. p. 174. Section 51 restricted the rights of any appointees to positions within the colleges but allowed Hobart and the other deans to continue in office until their deaths.Phillimore and Phillimore. p. 183. The prebends were left vacant in readiness and, on Hobart's death in 1846, the deanery was abolished, followed two years later by the college itself. Marriage and family On 5 October 1824, Hobart married Charlotte Selina Moore, daughter of Richard Moore, a Chelsea landowner who resided in an apartment at Hampton Court Palace. They had at least seven children.Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, 1840 Page 113 Their eldest son was Robert Hobart (1836‚Äì1928), a Liberal MP from 1906 to 1910, created a baronet in 1914.

The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual's deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results. > Dive safety is primarily a function of four factors: the environment, > equipment, individual diver performance and dive team performance.

Diving equipment is crucial because > it provides life support to the diver, but the majority of dive accidents > are caused by individual diver panic and an associated degradation of the > individual diver's performance. - M.A. Blumenberg, 1996 Human error is inevitable and most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. In a high risk environment, as is the case in diving, human error is more likely to have catastrophic consequences. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. These findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities. Only 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in commercial Scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to eliminate absolutely all minor contraindications of Scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and would bring all diving to a halt. Factors influencing the performance of a diving team A dive team may be considered as a system which is influenced by the following factors: * equipment * procedures * organization * environment * individuals * interactions There are considerations associated with each of these factors relating specifically to diving. Human factors Humans function underwater by virtue of technology, as our physiology is poorly adapted to the environment. Human factors are significant in diving because of this harsh and alien environment, and because diver life support systems and other equipment that may be required to perform specific tasks depend on technology that is designed, operated and maintained by humans, and because human factors are cited as significant contributors to diving accidents in most accident investigations Professional diving is a means to accomplish a wide range of activities underwater in a normally inaccessible and potentially hazardous environment. While working underwater, divers are subjected to high levels of physical and psychological stress due to environmental conditions and the limitations of the life support systems, as well as the rigours of the task at hand. Unmanned remotely operated vehicles (ROV's) allow performance of a variety of tasks at almost any depths for extended periods, but there are still many essential underwater tasks which can only be performed or are most effectively performed by a diver. A diver is still the most versatile underwater tool, but also the most unpredictable, and his own behaviour may threaten his safety. Recreational, or sport divers, including technical divers, dive for entertainment, and are usually motivated by a desire to explore and witness, though there is no distinct division between the underwater activities of recreational and professional divers. The primary distinction is that legal obligations and protection are significantly different, and this is reflected in organisational structure and procedures. Recreational diving has been rated more risky than snow skiing, but less risky than other adventure sports such as rock climbing, bungee jumping, motorcycle racing and sky diving. Improvements in training standards and equipment design and configuration, and increased awareness of the risks of diving, have not eliminated fatal incidents, which occur every year in what is generally a reasonably safe recreational activity. Both categories of diver are usually trained and certified, but recreational diving equipment is typically limited to Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (Scuba), whereas professional divers may be trained to use a greater variety of diving systems, from Scuba to surface supplied mixed gas and saturation systems. A recreational diver may use some ancillary equipment to enhance the diving experience, but the professional will almost always use tools to perform a specific task. Since the goal of recreational diving is personal enjoyment, a decision to abort a dive, for whatever reason, normally only affects the diver and his companions. A working diver faced with the same decision, must disappoint a client who needs and expects the diver's services, often with significant financial consequences. Therefore, the working diver often faces greater pressure to provide the service at the cost of reduced personal safety. An understanding of the human factors associated with diving may help the diving team to strike an appropriate balance between service delivery and safety. Human factors are the influences on human behavior, and the resulting effects of human performance on a process or system. Safety can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual's deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results. =Categories of error= Reason categorizes how errors occur by analysing what causes a plan to fail. *If a plan is good, but poorly executed, then failure is due to slips, lapses, trips or fumbles. *If the plan itself is faulty, then failure is due to a mistake. *If established or approved procedures or regulations are intentionally ignored, then a mistake can be categorised as a violation. Levels of performance These error categories relate to three levels of human performance: * Skill-based: Routine, practiced tasks performed in a largely automatic fashion, with occasional conscious progress checks. * Rule- based: If the automatic responses are unsuitable, a switch of level can be made where memorized performance patterns or rules are applied. These are structured on an If (situation), then do (actions) pattern, often similar to one from previous experience, and perceptions of the current situation are used to select an appropriate solution from memory. Potential solutions are developed through education, training, and experience, and are selected automatically from memory, but verified that they are appropriate by conscious thought. * Knowledge-based: When solutions from memory do not suit the current situation, the fall back is to knowledge-based solutions, where the current situation must be analysed and a solution developed in real time. Performance is relatively slow and laborious and the process is subject to errors resulting from constraints of information, time, understanding, intelligence and distractions. During emergencies, well-reasoned responses are often substituted by inappropriate and unsuccessful reactions. Error mechanisms Three error mechanisms can be defined which correlate the error categories with human performance levels: * Skill-based slips, lapses, and fumbles, where the plan is good but execution is not, due to inattention, distraction, or simply inadequate ability. * Rule-based mistakes, where a good rule is misapplied, a bad rule applied, or there is a failure to apply a good rule. * Knowledge-based mistakes, where a cognitive error is made in an attempt to analyse an unfamiliar problem. Violations Violations are a special category of mistakes where someone intentionally fails to apply a good rule, or deviates from acceptable or desirable practice. Four categories of violations may be identified: * Routine violations, which involve cutting corners, or taking short cuts, increasing risk for convenience or profit. * Violations 'for kicks', where rules are broken to prove machismo or to alleviate boredom. * Necessary violations, where the rules prevent people from performing a necessary task. * Exceptional violations, which usually are the result of extreme emotions. Age and gender are factors in the tendency to violate rules: Young men are more likely to violate rules than most older women, but men and women of all ages are similarly prone to error. These error mechanisms explain the psychological basis for errors, but the mechanisms are not readily observable. =Stress= Stress has been defined as \\"the result of an imbalance between the demands placed upon an individual and the capacity of that individual to respond to the demands\\" A person will respond to stress by taking actions to change the situation in order to reduce the stress When the actions are successful the result is described as 'coping', when unsuccessful the level of stress will increase and may lead to panic. The person exposed to a stressful situation (beyond skill based response), cognitively appraises the situation and compares it to previous experience using rule based or knowledge based assessment. The perception of stress is an individual reaction based on learned behaviour and available information and can vary dramatically between subjects. Perceived stress levels can in many cases be reduced by a reduction in uncertainty, which may result from education, training and experience, and a stressor which is perceived by one person as a threat, may be regarded as a challenge by someone else, or an inconvenience by a third person. These perceptions all evoke a response, but they indicate a very different level of tolerance and ability to cope with the situation. Once stress is perceived, the person must decide how to respond to the stressor. The situation must be assessed, memory interrogated, options evaluated, and an appropriate response chosen. Ability to perform the chosen response may be affected by the stress situation, and once the response has been attempted, the subject will review how the response has affected the situation, and judge whether the response has been effective. Depending on the perceived residual stress, the process may be stopped or repeated indefinitely until the situation has been resolved, or the stress level increases until the subject is no longer able to cope. Performance under stress The level of perceived stress can affect performance. When there is little stress there is a tendency toward carelessness that may result in poor performance, but sufficiently high stress can overwhelm capacity and cause degraded performance due to inability to cope. Optimum performance occurs when the stress levels are less than the person's ability to respond, but sufficient to keep them alert. This varies with the individual and the situation, and can not be maintained continuously, but performance can be improved through personnel selection and training. Training The benefits of training may include an increase in performance at a given stress level and improvement of coping skills by developing response reactions to given stress situations. These are patterns of action which have been learned by experience and can be applied to similar situations, when the person operates on Reason's rule-based performance level, and reduce the need for a long and error prone cognitive process, thereby saving time, reducing stress and improving the ability to cope. The objective of training should be to improve ability to continue the normal coping process when presented with unforeseen circumstances. A possible danger of training is over-reliance on learned procedures, as each stress situation is in some way unique and therefore no learned procedure will be a perfect match. The individual must retain the ability to assess whether the learned procedure is appropriate and adapt it to the specific situation. Therefore, training should include situational assessment and decision making under stress. Coping Appropriate stress response, or coping, is a cognitive process which evaluates a stress situation and the available options, then selects an appropriate course of action to respond. A diver needs to retain the ability to process information and make decisions while under stress, especially when confronted with unforeseen events. It is important for the diver to retain the ability to process information and make appropriate decisions while under stress. A sense of control and competence while under stress is crucial. An over-stressed person will tend lose control and truncate the coping process, and become indecisive, losing the ability to analyze and act. As the situation overcomes the individual's ability to cope, panic sets in and creates a barrier in the stress response that blocks the decision process. A lack of action or continuation of an inappropriate action may lead to errors and accidents. The diver's maxim, \\"stop, breathe, think, act\\", is a widely taught method for working through unexpected events underwater. The intention is to calm the diver and maintain an ability to cognitively appraise a stress situation. # Stop any action which may have created or is exacerbating the stress situation. This is intended to stabilise the situation sufficiently for the subsequent steps to be effective. # Focus on breathing effectively, concentrating on breathing rate and depth, and relaxing as much as possible. Experience shows that the majority of diver fatalities are due to drowning even though ample air was still available to the diver. This step should calm the diver's rising anxiety by showing him that adequate life support is on hand, and counteract any carbon dioxide buildup that may be contributing to anxiety. # Think about the problem. Assess the situation and evaluate the options for resolving the imposed stress. At this stage the diver is probably operating in Reason's knowledge-based performance level where training and education can provide tools to help solve the problem. # Select a preferred option and act. This completes the stress response process. If the response has the desired effect, the situation should resolve, otherwise further thought and another response will be needed. The dive maxim, \\"stop, breathe, think, act\\" is generally a good response, but it is not appropriate for all diving emergencies. This response assumes that both time and an adequate supply of breathing gas are available, and though this is often true, some situations require immediate learned responses which must be habituated by education, training and repetitive practice to overcome inappropriate instinctive and natural reflexive responses. For example, a diver should exhale whenever ascending to prevent lung overexpansion injuries, and if the diver is subject to a collision or sudden upwelling underwater, the natural reaction may be to tense up and hold his breath, particularly if the breathing gas supply is interrupted at the same time. This reaction could prove fatal if the diver is lifted sufficiently to cause lung overexpansion. Only through education training and practice, and perhaps proper selection, will the diver reflexively exhale as a response to a pressure reduction. Other factors suggested by Bachrach to prevent panic are listed below: # Physical fitness: having a reserve capacity. # Training which emphasizes in-water skills and comfort # Medical examinations to ensure no hidden contraindications to diving # Fatigue prevention or avoidance # Age limits Panic The most frequently cited cause of diver injury or death is panic, or a loss of control Analysis of the human factors associated with diving can identify the primary influences which lead to panic, and suggest methods to promote safety. Dive safety is primarily controlled by the individual diver and his ability to cope with stress underwater. The development of a diving accident may begin with a diver in a normal psychological and physiological state. The presence of a stressor may alter the diver's psychological and physiological state, and if the stress becomes excessive the diver's skills will diminish. Stressors may arise from human factors, the environment, equipment, procedures, organizational factors, or interactions between any of these, and these stress effects are cumulative. A diver is normally able to cope with applied stressors and perform the dive safely, and while the diver has sufficient capacity for coping, the stress is relieved or controlled and the operation can continue, but If the stress exceeds the diver's capacity, then the stressor is beyond the diver's control and an accident may result. From errors to accidents An accident is an event leading to injury, occupational illness, death, or material loss or damage. A \\"near accident\\" is an event which had the potential to cause injury, occupational illness, death, or material loss or damage, but did not due to some corrective action. Three critical stages can be identified in the development of an error into an accident: *contributing events and conditions, which create the situation in which the error is possible, or increase the probability of it occurring. *a direct cause: The action or lack of action which precedes and precipitates the error, and is an essential contribution to the commission of the error. *compounding events and conditions, which alter the consequences of the error once it has occurred. Equipment, procedures, organization, environment, individual factors and interactions between them are the sources of contributing and compounding events and conditions. Analysis of near accidents can be of great value to identify sources of error and allow planning to reduce or eliminate contributing and compounding conditions. A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident. > The fatality is the peak of the accident pyramid. The base of the pyramid is > the shortcuts, and in between are escalating levels of near-accidents which > could (but too often do not) serve as lessons learned. Blumenberg, 1996 Accident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal. Accidents continue to occur because the majority of the contributing and compounding factors are not addressed. Human behavior and the systems in which people work are too complex to analyse all possible interactions. A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur. Crisis management Accidents frequently appear to happen unexpectedly because people failed to recognize the indications of developing crisis which resulted in the accident. A crisis can be defined as a rapidly developing sequence of events in which the risks associated with the system rapidly increase to a hazardous state. The interaction of system factors is complex and often unpredictable, and hazard can accumulate at a rate which varies depending on the system, until corrective action is taken, the hazard dissipates without intervention, or an accident occurs. Although the individual operator is most often responsible for committing errors that cause accidents, it is also often the individual operator who is best placed to recognize the development of a dangerous situation and take corrective action, and this usually happens before the situation escalates into an accident. The ability of the operator to recognize potentially dangerous situations can be improved by incorporating warning mechanisms into systems, and training can significantly improve their ability to recognize the development of a hazardous situation and take appropriate corrective action in time to return the system to an acceptable level of safety. Equipment Diving equipment can be grouped into four general categories: * Life support equipment - the system that provides breathing gas to the diver. * Safety and protective equipment. * Equipment that helps the diver adapt to the underwater environment. * Specialized tools for performing underwater work. Manufacturers are continuously improving diving equipment to allow deeper, longer and safer diving operations, but the equipment still has ergonomic limitations and can exert significant stress on the diver: * Regulators require increased breathing effort. * Protective suits restrict mobility. * Fins work muscles differently to walking or running, which are more natural activities for humans. * Tools are often bulky, heavy, and physically difficult to move and operate underwater. Proper ergonomic engineering can reduce the physical demands on the diver due to the equipment, but it also important for equipment design to consider psychological aspects. Research by Morgan and others has shown that anxiety states may be a response to disordered breathing caused by use of breathing apparatus, and that some people experience respiratory distress or panic behaviour while doing physical exercise wearing scuba. Morgan has also recommended that more research be done on psychological aspects of human-respirator interface. Procedures Diving procedures are promulgated in many forms, including: * Navy Diving Manuals * Training and instructor reference manuals of the recreational diver training agencies * Government health and safety regulations * Codes of Practice published by government departments, IMCA and other associations of diving contractors, NOAA and other Scientific diving institutions, Cave diving groups etc. * Operations manuals of individual diving companies. Among the organisations publishing diving procedures, the US Navy, British HSE and NOAA are notable for funding published scientific research on diving safety. Separate dive procedures are developed for each type of diving, such as air and mixed gas diving, inshore and offshore diving, or recreational and professional diving. Decompression tables, programs and algorithms that prescribe depth and time limitations are also a subset of procedures, and highlight the unique nature of the hyperbaric work environment. Environment > The underwater work environment exposes divers to physical, psychological > and pathological stresses. No other industrial working environment alters > normal worker physiology more than diving. Blumenberg 1996 Environmental influences include pressure, cold, currents, surge, and limited visibility, and underwater conditions can change rapidly, often without warning. Dive teams must anticipate environmental conditions and their effects, and plan accordingly. The diving environment cannot be controlled, but the diving team can control when and how the diver enters the underwater environment. Individual The dominant factor controlling diver safety is the individual diver's physical and mental fitness to dive, and physical and psychological evaluation of divers can improve dive safety. Not everyone has the physical and mental capacity to dive safely. Professional diving can be physically demanding work, and some diving tasks require considerable strength and stamina, and a sufficient reserve of physical and psychological strength to cope with unexpected situations. The requirements for recreational diving may be less rigorous, but any diver, whether professional or recreational, should have some minimum capabilities in order to dive safely. Physical screening standards which take into account anticipated work demands are commonly used by commercial and military divers, and detailed lists of physical contraindications to diving have been published. These standards can vary widely, but the need for physical screening is generally accepted. Behavioral problems may be more important than physical problems because 'no amount of physical screening can protect a diver from his own stupidity' and 'the majority of diving accidents are caused by poor judgment or inattention to the basic rules of diving safety... ' Mental fitness may be at least as important as physical fitness for divers. and maturity and responsibility should be evaluated as carefully as physical health and fitness. Selection of divers should match the individual's mental and physical abilities to job demands, but although research has successfully developed a unique psychological profile for divers, psychological screening is seldom applied. According to Morgan, divers are \\"characterized by low scores for measures of anxiety, and high scores for measures of aggression, assertiveness, confidence and sensation-seeking; they also tend to possess an internal locus of control.\\" Morgan has also successfully used Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to predict with 88% accuracy which divers amongst a class of new recreational divers would experience panic. Organization The organizational factor is the dominant controllable factor affecting behavior of the individual diver. The organization can be analysed at several levels ranging from a two-man buddy team through the dive team, the whole organization and up to the whole diving industry, and all organizational levels influence the individual diver's behavior and performance. Interactions Interactions between the other factors is the most unpredictable factor. Some interactions are linear and relatively easily predicted, but others are complex. Unanticipated interactions between factors can be critical when a diver is working in an isolated hyperbaric environment. Thorough planning and preparation can help to minimize unanticipated interactions, and effective coping skills may be necessary to control interactions when they occur. Psychological tests? Why accidents happen The simplistic statement that most diving accidents are due to diver error does not address the underlying reasons for the diver making the mistake. Errors are inherent in human nature, and it is more useful to consider all levels of influence on the behaviour of the diver as this may throw light on the reasons why the same errors are repeated so often. Analyses of aviation accidents show that 60 to 80% of aviation accidents are at least partly due to human error. The techniques of Human Factor Error Analysis can be applied to diving at all levels of the industry and sport, and can provide insight into why incidents occur and divers die. Industrial accident analysis indicates a ratio of around 1 in 600 of fatalities to reportable accidents, and the British Hyperbaric Association indicates that approximately 3.5 times the number of divers are recompressed as are reported through the BSAC incident reporting system. =Failure of accident filters= A four layered model for defense against human error has been described, which attributes error to three levels of latent failure and one of active failure, and posits that in general an accident is due to failure of all four levels of defence. These levels are: *Influence of the organisation: Which should provide a culture of safety. *Supervision: Which should provide a system of oversight and checks, and backup for contingencies. *Preconditions: The state of the diver and equipment, including levels of health, fitness, skill and training, condition and suitability of equipment, planning and communications. *Actions of the diver: Situational awareness, response to contingencies. The failures associated with these levels are labelled: *Organisational influences - a level of latent failures: In professional diving, the employer, diving contractor, health and safety authority etc. In recreational diving, the organisational culture of the training and certification agencies and dive schools, resorts and employers of instructors and divemasters. *Unsafe supervision - a level of latent failures: In recreational diving this level includes the other members of a dive team, such as the buddy, dive leaders (divemasters) and skippers, who are to some degree responsible for safety. *Preconditions for unsafe acts - a level of latent failures: These are preconditions in the diver and his equipment which aggravate the risk of diver error occurring. *Unsafe acts - the active failures: The actions which lead directly to the accident, the actual \\"Diver error\\", usually blamed in isolation for the accident. =Unsafe actions= Unsafe actions can be categorised as errors or violations. Errors Errors are events where the outcome is not that which was intended or hoped for, or expected, and the precipitating action is unintentional. =Errors of skill= *Incorrect equipment assembly and checking *Inadequate performance of standard and emergency procedures :*Poor finning technique - silting out, inefficient propulsion. :*Poor buoyancy control - violations of decompression obligation, barotraumas. *Omitted step in a procedure where order is critical *Incorrect gas planning and monitoring Skill based errors refer to skills learned during training. These should generally be sufficiently well learned to be done without much conscious thought, as an almost automatic reaction to the circumstances. This makes them more reliable in a stressful situation, but also makes them more susceptible to performance loss with retention interval (when not practiced often enough). The rate of performance degradation depends on degree of overlearning, skill type and personal differences. Other skill based errors involve incorrect technique. This can be a result of incorrect training or inadequate assessment and feedback during training, or learning bad habits after training. Skill based errors are prevented by practicing skills and ensuring that they are effective. =Errors of decision= These are errors where the actions proceed according to intention, but prove to be inappropriate. Procedural errors *Inappropriate response to an emergency. :*Failing to recognise an emergency in time to take corrective action. :*Failure to communicate a problem to the team. :*Misunderstanding a communication from another diver in difficulty. :*Applying the wrong procedure when the situation is correctly identified. These errors occur when a situation is either not recognised, or misdiagnosed, or the diver has forgotten the correct reaction. These are all more probable if the stress level is already high unless the procedures have been well entrenched in memory by regular training and practice. Regular training with multiple scenarios and honest debriefings are recommended as mitigation for this class of error. Poor choice *Poor decision on whether or not to terminate a dive. :*Continuing a dive after equipment failure eliminates bailout options. :*Continuing dive after buddy separation. :*Continuing dive in inappropriate environmental conditions. :*Continuing dive after gas critical pressures are reached. :*Continuing dive after agreed time or decompression limits reached. *Wrong gas chosen for the depth. *Inadequate thermal protection chosen. *Diving without appropriate bailout equipment. Problem solving errors When a problem is not fully understood and learned procedures do not fit the situation the diver is more likely to make errors in problem solving. The suitability of the process for making decisions depends to a large extent on the time available. Immediately life-threatening problems must be dealt with immediately, but other problems allow some time for considering the situation before reacting. As available time increases, the applicability of knowledge based processes and analytical processes also increases. Errors of decision can be mitigated by ensuring that the diver has experienced a wide variety of reasonably probable scenarios, preferably as live simulations, or if this is not practicable, as mental exercises. Having considered the scenario and worked on problem solving provides a pattern of thought which can assist in solving similar problems in real incidents, and the diver is more likely to work on problem solving and less likely to panic. Instructors with varied, relevant and current diving experience are more likely to provide this sort of training experience. =Errors of perception= *Misjudgement of environmental conditions. *Misreading of instruments. *Misjudgement of gas consumption and requirement *Disorientation. Misinterpretation of landmarks and loss of way. *Misperception of ascent or descent rate. Depth and visual perception errors are easily made underwater as we are not optimised for the environment, and lack of recent experience can aggravate the problem. This can easily lead to disorientation. Nitrogen narcosis can compound this effect and make reasoned judgements considerably more difficult below 30m, but this can be reduced by the use of helium. Colour discrimination is also diminished with depth and darkness, and colour-coding becomes an unreliable method of identifying equipment at the times when it is most critical and an error can be fatal. Violations Violations are events where the consequences are foreseeable, and the action is taken with knowledge of the possible consequences, and knowledge that the risk is not generally considered acceptable within the organisational environment of the agent. Routine violations occur when policy violations are made due to a history of \\"getting away with it\\", so the perception develops that the risk is lower than it really is and the violation can become the norm. Accident analysis suggests that most accidents are caused by violations of teaching or agency recommendations. Exceptional violations occur when the procedures or policies are intentionally violated without need or good cause. Situational violations occur when the consequences of the violation are understood, but the violation is honestly assessed to be the best course of action available under the circumstances. Some examples of violations: *Failure to follow dive plan. *Exceeding range of training or competence. *Diving without appropriate equipment for the expected circumstances. *Neglecting to prepare equipment properly *Exerting pressure on other divers to exceed their range of competence. *Exceeding MOD of breathing gas. *Ignoring warning alarms and information on instruments and safety systems. :*going into unplanned decompression :*continuing the dive beyond critical pressures for turnaround or ascent :*continuing the dive after equipment failure has degraded emergency recovery capabilities. =Preconditions for unsafe actions= Substandard practices =Communication and team skills= Good communication and team or buddy skills are necessary to limit the risk of a recoverable incident deteriorating into an accident. A good team has more capacity to deal with an emergency than a solo diver in most circumstances, but in the absence of adequate team or buddy skills, a solo diver may be safer Team and communications skills are relevant at the planning and preparation stages as well as in the water. A team must be familiar with each other's equipment, and the gas planning of all members must be compatible. Constructive debriefing after the dive can help the team members make the most of the learning opportunities of the dive. *Planning failures :*Inadequate risk assessment :*Inadequate contingency planning :*Inadequate dive planning: Gas and decompression planning :*Failure to use available and appropriate resources *Communications failures :*Inadequate briefing :*Misinterpretation of signals :*Failure to log in and out with backup personnel :*Unfamiliarity with buddy or team's equipment. =Personal readiness= There are a large range of circumstances, some within the control of the dier, some not, which can temporarily degrade the ability of the diver to dive safely. Some of these are purely physical, others have a psychological influence. Many are to some extent self-inflicted. Examples: *Accepting the responsibilities of a buddy diver before the dive and then not paying due attention to staying within appropriate distance of the buddy. *Taking on responsibilities of a buddy diver knowing that one is not capable of carrying them out in an emergency. *Accepting appointment as standby diver while knowing that one is unfit or not competent to perform a rescue under the apparent circumstances. *Self medication with unsuitable medications *Use of alcohol or recreational drugs. *Inadequate rest *Dehydration *Time stress due to running late *Overheated or chilled *Poor preparation of personal equipment *Poor condition of personal equipment *Denial of existing medical problem Divers should not be deterred by peer pressure from declining a dive when they are ill-prepared, and they should not allow themselves to be pressured by service providers such as boat skippers and divemasters into accepting responsibility for the safety of another diver if they do not feel confident that both they and the other diver can deal adequately with any reasonably foreseeable problem that may occur during the dive. Substandard conditions of operators =Adverse mental states= Divers need to be aware of their surroundings as they operate in an alien environment and inattention can result in missing a critical cue which could have allowed early response to a problem. Any mental state which is likely to reduce the situational awareness of the diver will increase risk. Examples: *Task fixation. *Complacency. *Distraction. *Fatigue. *Undue haste. *Lack of situational awareness, inattention. *Misplaced motivation. *Excessive task loading. *Pre-existing stress. =Adverse physiological states= Diving while in a sub-optimal physical condition reduces the reserves available for dealing with a problem. Clearly not all divers are equal in their physical strength and fitness, but people learn to compensate for personal differences, and become accustomed to dealing with situations from their ground state. Any reduction in capacity from the normal status is likely to present unfamiliar challenges in a crisis, and may precipitate an unrecoverable chain of events, as normally adequate reactions are found to be insufficient, and fail to rectify the situation as expected. Furthermore, some conditions such as injuries, dehydration or illness may physiologically predispose the diver to other conditions such as decompression sickness, hypothermia or barotraumas. Examples: *Impaired physiological condition, illness. *Physiological incapacitation, :*seasickness, :*hypothermia, :*exhaustion, :*dehydration etc, =Physical and mental limitations= Personal strength and fitness vary amongst people. Furthermore, they vary with time for the same person, and although the underwater environment reduces the effects of gravity, there are other factors which can make activity more strenuous, such as viscous drag, increased work of breathing and adverse water movements. Mental abilities also affect a diver's capacity to deal with unexpected situations. Two common factors influencing a diver's accurate and objective assessment of situations and their ability to cope with conditions are ignorance of the realities, and the tendency to overestimate personal competence which is most notable in those with the least ability to make an accurate judgement. Both of these factors can be mitigated by continued study and training. In effect, the best way to learn how to accurately judge competence in a skill set, is to be competent at those skills. In the absence of personal competence, the person must rely on the objective judgement and accurate feedback of instructors, supervisors and other persons in perceived positions of authority. Failure to provide this feedback is not a kindness, it is a dereliction of responsibility, as it may lead to potentially dangerous misjudgements of ability to seal with the rigour of the underwater environment, particularly where the specific circumstances are outside the experience of the diver. The influence of experience on the accurate self-assessment of competence is not so clear cut. Some incompetent people are able to go through a wide range and depth of experience without discovering their incompetence or improving their skills. Kruger and Dunning suggest that those with limited knowledge in a field suffer a double burden: \\"Not only do they reach mistaken conclusions and make regrettable errors, but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize it.\\" Examples: *Physical inability to manage the conditions. *Inadequate strength or fitness to perform emergency procedures. *Ignorance of skill limitations. *Denial of skill limitations. =Unsafe supervision= Causal factors go beyond the operator, and extend to supervision. In the context of recreational diving, supervision refers to dive leaders, dive guides, instructors, topside dive marshals and dive boat skippers, and in the club environment, also to the diving officer or training officer and experienced divers acting as mentors to less experienced divers. In the professional context, ir refers to the dive supervisor and other on-site management personnel. Supervisors have a moral duty to their charges,and may have a legal duty as well. These duties may include giving guidance, providing training or learning opportunities, leadership by example and direction, information and motivation. The duty to act as a good role model is important as although the supervisor may advise or instruct charges to do things in an appropriate way, it is what the role model actually does that often has the most lasting impression. Poor technique and incorrect information passed on by a person in a supervisory position may perpetuate the use of unsafe or inefficient procedures. Failure to correct poor technique or skills has a similar effect, whether it is due to indifference or ignorance on the part of the supervisor. A further manifestation of poor supervision may occur when the supervisor does not have the experience appropriate to the current environment. Unsafe supervision can be split into four categories? Inadequate supervision Examples: *Failure to provide guidance *Failure to comply with agency policies or operations manuals *Failure to provide oversight *Failure to provide training *Failure to provide feedback *Allocation of unsuitable buddies Failure to correct a known problem Examples: *Failure to correct documentation errors *Failure to identify a diver at risk *Failure to initiate corrective action *Failure to report unsafe tendencies or behaviour *Failure to report reportable incidents *Use of equipment or support facilities known to be unreliable or defective Inappropriately planned operations Examples: *Failure to provide sufficient briefing time *Failure to allow sufficient time for preparation and checking of equipment and kitting up *Planning or authorising operations in conflict with authorised procedures, codes of practice, operations manuals, regulations etc. *Failure to check emergency equipment *Failure to conduct adequate risk assessment *Failure to monitor diving operations according to agreed protocol *Failure to modify dive plans to compensate for changing conditions *Failure to record next of kin and contact details Supervisory violations Examples: *Promoting or tolerating in-group peer pressure. *Sanctioning unnecessary risk *Failure to enforce regulatory requirements, organizational rules and requirements. *Sanctioning inappropriate transgression of qualification, experience or known competence. =Organisational influences= The influence of an organisation are less immediately obvious, and may be difficult to quantify. Many latent unsafe conditions originate with decision makers who are at a distance from the dive site and may be unaware of the full consequences of their directives. They may be biased by economic or political pressures and outdated knowledge and experience. Often decisions are made without full consideration of the possible consequences, not necessarily intentionally, and some unsafe policy decisions can not be avoided, so there should be measures to identify them and mitigate them before they have adverse consequences. Resource management Examples: *Human resources :*Selection :*Staffing :*Training *Financial resources :*Excessive cost cutting :*Lack of funding *Equipment and facilities :*Poor design :*Acquisition of unsuitable equipment :*Inadequate maintenance Organisational philosophy Examples: *Structure :*Chain of command :*Delegation of authority :*Communication :*Accountability *Policies :*Job security :*Promotion :*Dealing with violations *Culture :*Norms :*Values :*Fairness Organisational process Examples: *Operations :*Time pressure, schedules and deadlines :*Work quotas, measures of success :*Schedules and planning *Procedures :*Standards :*Clarity of objectives :*Documentation :*Instructions *Oversight :*Risk management :*Safety programs Improving dive safety =Improving individual performance under stress= =Implementing human factors improvements into dive teams= =Identifying problems within the organisation= =Training program development= Evaluate training Reinforcing human factors skills =Accident investigations= An investigation of some kind usually follows a fatal diving accident, or one in which litigation is expected. There may be several investigations with different agendas. If police are involved, they generally look for evidence of a crime. In the US the Coastguard will usually investigate if there is a death when diving from a vessel in coastal waters. Health and safety administration officials may investigate when the diver was injured or killed at work. When a death occurs during an organised recreational activity, the certification agency's insurers will usually send an investigator to look into possible liability issues. The investigation may occur almost immediately to some considerable time after the event. In most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, and in this process equipment is usually removed and may be damaged or lost, or the evidence compromised by inappropriate handling. Witnesses may have dispersed, and equipment is often mishandled by the investigating authorities who are often unfamiliar with the equipment and may store it improperly, which can destroy evidence and compromise findings. Recreational diving accidents are usually relatively uncomplicated, but accidents involving an extended range environment of specialised equipment may require expertise beyond the experience of any one investigator. This is a particular issue when rebreather equipment is involved. For every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of \\"near miss\\" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. Ideally these will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future. Professional diving accidents are usually investigated when a reportable injury occurs in terms of occupational health and safety legislation. The purpose is generally to allow avoidance of recurrences of the circumstances leading to the incident if practicable, and where relevant, to establish whether there was fault attributable to any involved party, which could lead to criminal or civil charges. Accident investigation may help to identify the cause of a specific accident. If a pattern can be identified this may inform procedures and legislation to reduce the risk of the same pattern of accident recurring in the future. An investigation may identify shortcomings in training or procedures, or problems with equipment. Fatalities are often investigated as potential crimes until the cause of death has been identified. Insurance claims may rely on information from an investigation to establish whether the accident is covered by a policy. Occupational health and safety inspectors may investigate an occupational diving incident to identify whether regulations have been violated. Civil litigation for claimed damages can be more equitably decided when the circumstances leading to the injury have been identified. The ability to provide documentary evidence showing that correct procedure was followed can simplify the investigation and may lead to more accurate and reliable findings. Equipment, procedures, organization, environment, individual factors and interactions between them are the sources of contributing and compounding events and conditions. Analysis of near accidents can be of great value to identify sources of error and allow planning to reduce or eliminate contributing and compounding conditions. A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident. Accident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal. Accidents continue to occur because the majority of the contributing and compounding factors are not addressed. Human behavior and the systems in which people work are too complex to analyse all possible interactions. A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur.

Leading and lagging current are phenomena that occur as a result of alternating current. In a circuit with alternating current, the value of voltage and current vary sinusoidally. In this type of circuit, the terms lead, lag, and in phase are used to describe current with reference to voltage. Current is in phase with voltage when there is no phase shift between the sinusoids describing their time varying behavior. This generally occurs when the load drawing the current is resistive. In electric power flow, it is important to know how much current is leading or lagging because it creates the reactive power in the system, as opposed to the active (real) power. It can also play an important role in the operation of three-phase electric power systems. Angle notation Angle notation can easily describe leading and lagging current: A \\\\angle \\\\theta.Nilsson p. 338 In this equation, the value of theta is the important factor for leading and lagging current. As mentioned in the introduction above, leading or lagging current represents a time shift between the current and voltage sine curves, which is represented by the angle by which the curve is ahead or behind of where it would be initially. For example, if Œ∏ is zero, the curve will have amplitude zero at time zero. Using complex numbers is a way to simplify analyzing certain components in RLC circuits. For example, it is very easy to convert these between polar and rectangular coordinates. Starting from the polar notation, \\\\angle \\\\theta can represent either the vector (\\\\cos \\\\theta, \\\\sin \\\\theta)\\\\, or the rectangular notation \\\\cos \\\\theta + j \\\\sin \\\\theta = e^{j\\\\theta},\\\\, both of which have magnitudes of 1. Lagging current A \\\\angle \\\\theta =A \\\\angle \\\\delta - (\\\\beta) Lagging current can be formally defined as ‚Äúan alternating current that reaches its maximum value up to 90 degrees later than the voltage that produces it.‚Äù This means that current lags the voltage when \\\\beta, the angle of the current sine wave with respect to an arbitrarily chosen reference, is less than \\\\delta, the angle of the voltage sine wave with respect to the same reference. Therefore, current can quickly be identified as lagging if the angle \\\\theta is positive. For example, if the voltage angle \\\\delta is zero, current will be lagging if \\\\beta is negative. This is often the case because voltage is taken as the reference. In circuits with primarily inductive loads, current lags the voltage. This happens because in an inductive load, it is the induced electromotive force that causes the current to flow. Note that in the definition above, the current is produced by the voltage. The induced electromotive force is caused by a change in the magnetic flux linking the coils of an inductor. Leading current A \\\\angle \\\\theta =A \\\\angle \\\\delta + (\\\\beta) Leading current can be formally defined as ‚Äúan alternating current that reaches its maximum value up to 90 degrees ahead of the voltage that it produces.‚Äù This means that the current leads the voltage when \\\\beta, the angle of the current sine wave with respect to an arbitrarily chosen reference is greater than \\\\delta, the angle of the voltage sine wave with respect to the same reference. Therefore, current can quickly be identified as leading if the angle \\\\theta is negative. For example, if the voltage angle \\\\delta is zero, current will be leading if \\\\beta is positive. This is often the case because voltage is taken as the reference. In circuits with primarily capacitive loads, current leads the voltage. This is true because current must first flow to the two plates of the capacitor, where charge is stored. Only after charge accumulates at the plates of a capacitor is a voltage difference established. The behavior of the voltage is thus dependent on the behavior current and on how much charge accumulates. This is why the formal definition states that the current produces the voltage. Visualizing leading and lagging current A simple phasor diagram with a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and phasors can be used to visualize leading and lagging current at a fixed moment in time. In the real-complex coordinate system, one period of a sine wave corresponds to a full circle in the complex plane. Since the voltage and current have the same frequency, at any moment in time those quantities can be easily represented by stationary points on the circle, while the arrows from the center of circle to those points are called phasors. Since the relative time difference between functions is constant, they also have a constant angle difference between them, represented by the angle between points on the circle. Historical documents concerning leading and lagging currents An early source of data is an article from the 1911 American Academy of Arts and Sciences by Arthur E. Kennelly. Kennelly uses conventional methods in solving vector diagrams for oscillating circuits, which can also include alternating current circuits as well.

Its habitat are the bamboo groves and forests in the cooler regions of northern Thailand, northern Laos, northern Myanmar, and adjacent parts of Yunnan Province, China. The mature caterpillars are viewed as a delicacy by the inhabitants of these regions. The wingspan of the male is 4 cm with a 2-cm-long body. The female is slightly larger with a 4.5 cm wingspan and a 2.2-cm-long body. The wings of this moth are orange-brown in colour, with black, curved stripes. The caterpillar is white in colour with a body length of 3.5 to 4 cm. Lifecycle The adult moth only lives for two months: July and August. Mating takes place at night in early August after which the female lays a cluster of about 80-130 eggs near the base of a bamboo shoot. The larvae hatch after 12 days, and are pale brown in colour and covered with long hair. Working together, the larvae bore an entrance hole at an internode of the bamboo in one day. After entering the shoot, they then, also in one day, bore an exit hole for the mature moths from which to eventually emerge. The larvae turn white within three days. Boring their way upwards from one bamboo internode to another, the larvae feed on the fresh inner pulp of the bamboo while avoiding common predators such as birds. After 45 to 60 days, the larvae mature and migrate down to the internode containing the exit hole where they enter a period of diapause for eight months, hanging upside down from the roof of the internode. This long period of diapause is exceptional for a tropical insect, and probably caused by the monsoonal character of the region which has a cool, dry period from November to February, a hot season from March to June, followed by a wet period from June through October, affecting the availability of food for the larvae. The pupal phase takes 46 to 60 days and falls in June and July. Eleven different species of bamboo are infested. The infestation does not harm the plants, but instead makes the bamboo stronger than uninfested bamboo. However, the bamboo worm's activity may cause irregular growth patterns in the bamboo shoots which they occupy. In northern Thailand, O. fuscidentalis infestations have been found in Dendrocalamus membranaceus, D. hamiltonii, D. strictus, Bambusa nutans, B. blumeana, Gigantochloa albociliata, and G. nigrociliata. As food Deep-fried \\"bamboo worms\\" at a market in Bangkok Collection of the larvae for consumption by people falls mainly in the period of diapause when the larvae congregate in one single internodal cavity. This involves carefully piercing through sections of the bamboo shoots with a cleaver where water is trapped. Cutting down the entire shoot will endanger the worms natural habitat. Together with other types of insects, the consumption of bamboo worms is gaining popularity in Asian regions.Insects as food and feed in the Asia Pacific region: current perspectives and future directions About 26% of their body weight is protein, and 51% fat. The name in Thai cuisine for this delicacy is \\"bamboo worm\\" (non mai phai, ), but due to its appearance, it is commonly called rot duan (Thai: ‡∏£‡∏ñ‡∏î‡πà‡∏ß‡∏ô), meaning \\"express train\\". They are also considered to be an environmentally friendly diet as they do not require a large amount of resources when they are raised. Now, because of the greater demand for bamboo worms as food, they are being commercially bred and cultivated by insect farmers to ensure that their population in the wild is not affected. They are usually eaten deep-fried, sometimes flavoured with herbs, spices or condiments.

Early castle Before the Roman occupation of Gaul, an oppidum had been constructed for defence on the Truc de Gr√®zes, a hill (1 008 m) near the present day village. During the Gallo-Roman period in Gr√®zes, then named Gredonense castrum, a fortress came to replace the oppidum. Below this, on the site of the present village, the village of Gredone was built during a period of peace. After the Romans had left, the hill remained a strong point; the castle was enlarged over the course of the years. The castle witnessed the Hundred Years' War though the reinforcement of its walls did not prevent the English from seizing the town. It was only after the victories of troops led by Bertrand du Guesclin over Astorg de Peyre, one of the Barons of G√©vaudan and the liberation of Apcher and Randon, that Gr√®zes recovered its freedom, though much weakened. Later, the Wars of Religion shook the region. Gr√®zes was one of many villages pillaged by the Huguenot captain, Matthieu Merle, at the behest of the widow of Astorg de Peyre, seeking vengeance against the Catholics. (It was her husband's death in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre which started the war in G√©vaudan.) A strategic point, Gr√®zes was occupied for seven years by Merle's troops. The fortress was destroyed in 1576 in order to drive them out. However, this did not prevent them capturing Mende on Christmas night in 1579. Around 1632, King Louis XIII ordered the dismantling of the castles at Luc, Gr√®zes and Ch√¢teauneuf-de-Randon. Later castle The castle visible in the village today is not the one that made the name of Gr√®zes. It was only built after the destruction of the earlier castle, on the orders of Cardinal Richelieu, and thus dates from the 17th century. It consists of a four storeyed, heavy, square building, with a tower attached. This is the only tower remaining; others were destroyed in the wars of religion at the start of the 18th century.

Glenada was built by Russel Brothers Limited in Owen Sound, Ontario. It is one of twenty 1943 Glen-class tugs, eleven of which were built by the Russel Brothers Company. When it served for the Royal Canadian Navy the official number for this boat was (W30) 177886 and the Canadian Navy number was 534. The Glen-class tugs were made in two designs (designated \\"A\\" and \\"B\\"); Glenada is an \\"A\\" design, with a longer main deck house, extending aft over the engine room, and uniform height bulwarks from forward to aft. A lifeboat is mounted on the bridgedeck aft of the stack. Glenada was originally powered by one Vivian 8-cylinder diesel ( with supercharger). After it was decommissioned from the navy it was registered in Montreal in 1956, and used by Sandrin Bros. in Sarnia, Ontario until 1995 when it was purchased by Thunder Bay Tug Services who still owns/runs it in Lake Superior. In 1977 Glenada was widened on each side. In 1977 the main engine suffered serious damage while assisting a ship named Hilda Marjanne in the St. Clair River. This led to the engine was being swapped out for a Caterpillar D399 V16 turbo- charged diesel engine that produces at 1200 RPM. The tug has two generators, a Detroit Diesel 3-71 generator and a John Deere 4-cylinder diesel generator. Service history Glenada and its crew were on hand to assist in the 1996 rescue of a cruise ship named Grampa Woo that had broken free from its dock while undergoing repairs. At the time of the incident, Grampa Woo had no propulsion capability, and was adrift. The Medal of Bravery was awarded to Captain Gerry Dawson, M.B. and Engineer John E.

He collaborated with figure artists on compositions which combined allegorical or mythological scenes with a still life element.Jean Baptist Bosschaert, Flowers in a Neoclassical Sculptured Vase with a Butterfly at Lorenzelli He was active in Antwerp.Jan Baptist Bosschaert at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Jan Baptist Bosschaert was born in Antwerp as the son of the painter-baker Jan Baptist and his second wife Joanna de Bie, the sister of the painter Erasmus de Bie. His father died young leaving Jan Baptist in a poor home and without education. He was reportedly still illiterate at the age of 17. Still life of flowers with a young woman.jpg As the young Jan Baptist showed talent for art his brothers who were his guardians placed him in the care of the flower painter Jan Baptist de Cr√©pu. He studied with de Cr√©pu starting from the year 1685. He lived also in de Cr√©pu's house. Another pupil of de Cr√©pu who studied at the same time as Bosschaert was the flower painter Simon Hardim√©.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1149‚Äì1140 Jan Baptist de Cr√©pu fled his creditors in 1688 and died in Brussels the next year.Jacopo Lorenzelli, Eckard Lingenauber, Daniele Benati, The lure of still life, Galleria Lorenzelli, Galerie Lingenauber Galleria Lorenzelli, 1995, p. 230 Bosschaert became in the Guild year 1692‚Äì1693 a master of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1149‚Äì1140 Bosschaert was active in Antwerp as a flower painter and received many commissions from the local bourgeoisie. Nothing is known about his personal life. He died in Antwerp in 1746. Work =General= Bosschaert was a specialist still life painter mainly of large flower still lifes. Not many signed works by his hand are known and many may still be located in private collections without proper attribution. Together with those of his near contemporary Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger, his works represent a development towards a more decorative style in late 17th century Flemish still life painting. The two artists placed the flower bouquets in large stone vases or arranged them in the form of garlands around these vases or garden ornaments.Sam Segal, A Flowery Past: A Survey of Dutch and Flemish Flower Painting from 1600 Until the Present : Gallery P. de Boer, Amsterdam, March 13 ‚Äì April 11, 1982, Noordbrabants Museum, 's-Hertogenbosch, April 29 ‚Äì May 30, 1982, Gallery P. de Boer, 198, pp. 59‚Äì60 In these works garlands of sumptuous flowers are entwined around sculpted urns.Jan Baptist Bosschaert, Still lifes of elaborate sculpted urns decorated with carnations, parrot tulips, irises, morning glory and other flowers at Sotheby's The vases were often placed in outdoor settings with figures. This style was followed by Simon Hardim√©, Pieter Hardim√© and Pieter Casteels III. His large vertical paintings with their tripartite division followed Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger's compositions.David Oldfield, Later Flemish paintings in the National Gallery of Ireland: the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, National Gallery of Ireland, 1992, p. 56 Still life of elaborate sculpted urns decorated with flowers In its use of broad, impasto brush strokes, the style of his work reflects developments initiated by Italian artists Mario Nuzzi and Michele Pace del Campidoglio. The work of the French painter Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer was also an influence.Sam Segal, Mari√´l Ellens, Joris Dik, The temptations of Flora: Jan van Huysum, 1682‚Äì1749, Stedelijk Museum \\"Het Prinsenhof\\", Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Waanders, 2007, p. 33 =Collaborations= Bosschaert collaborated with various specialist painters including the figure painter Jacob LeyssensJacob Leyssens in Van der Aa e.a., Biographisch Woordenboek der Nederlanden The Antwerp painter Peeter-Frans Bailliu painted the vases, figures and grisailles in some of his compositions.Peeter-Frans Bailliu at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The collaborative works involved typically a female figure representing an allegorical or mythological figure or putti with a large flower piece. This likely went back on 16th century motifs of the goddess Flora in her garden.Weltkunst, Volume 58, 1988, p. 17 Young woman in front of a classical relief surrounded by flowers Bosschaert also produced 'garland paintings', an older genre of flower representation invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder. The genre was subsequently practised by leading Flemish still life painters, such as Daniel Seghers. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. In the later development of the genre, the devotional image was replaced by other subjects such as portraits, mythological subjects and allegorical scenes.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Sometimes the still life painter would paint the garland and only much later another painter would add the figures or grisaille in the centre. The centre in some of the garland paintings that have been preserved were never filled by an image. The cartouche in the center of Bosschaert's garland paintings was usually filled with non-religious imagery such as portraits and mythological scenes. The Garland of flowers surrounding a medallion enclosing an early Christian motif (Auctioned at Bonhams 9 December 2015 in London lot 90W) is an example of a garland painting by Bosschaert.

Biography  He was born on July 14, 1888 in Burlington, Iowa. Hartman ran away from home at the age of 15 working his first job at the Illinois Steel Boiler Company in Chicago, Illinois, and offering his labor for free at the neighboring Goddard Balloon company. He soloed in a balloon on 6 September 1903, three months before the first heavier than air flight by the Wright Brothers. Hartman would demonstrate parachute drops from a balloon, and at one point from a water tower resulting in a landing in power lines that left him unconscious. Later in 1907, Hartman and a partner built a 67 ft long airship. In 1910 Hartman built the Hartman monoplane, based on a Bl√©riot XI design. His small hop performed on 10 May 1910 became the first flight of an aircraft in Iowa. Hartman founded the short-lived Hartman-Sellers Airplane Company in 1919 with a fleet of one aircraft that produced more income off the hay from the airfield than barnstorming and operations. The Burlington Airplane Company was founded next after World War I to sell Curtiss Jenny services. Hartman remained active in aviation throughout his life founding Burlington Municipal Airport in 1927 and operating a flight school. In 1956 Hartman demonstrated the Hartman Air-Bike, a series of 50 hydrogen balloons propelled by a suspended pedal-powered frame with a propeller. In 1961, Hartman completed a scratch-built Curtiss Jenny, and demonstrated it at the age of 73. He died on October 19, 1970 in Burlington, Iowa.

For example, both the male and female genders are subject to assumptions of heterosexuality. If a man were to behave in feminine ways, his heterosexuality would be doubted, and individuals may assume that he is gay. Two main theoretical perspectives dominate discussions of gendered sexuality: that of an evolutionary perspective, and that of a sociocultural perspective. Although these two are typically separate, Eagly & Wood believe that these two theories could potentially be reconcilable. Gender and sex in gendered sexuality Both the terms gender and sex have been historically interchangeable, but it was not until the late 1960s and early 70s that the term gender began to be more thoroughly defined and spread throughout the literature within the field of psychology. Although the term has undergone some changes since then, today it represents how an individual feels and expresses their gender, typically through masculinity or femininity. Through this definition, gender has often been used as a variable to study how particular parts of people, (i.e. one's sexuality), can ultimately be informed by gender. Psychological research in this area has tended to follow these three modes of looking at gender: # Looking at gender through difference in presentation, actions, and traits # Looking at gender vs. individual difference in individuals who identify as male and individuals who identify as female, and # Looking at how gender influences how both men and women operate in society Human sexuality, unlike gender, has kept a relatively stable definition by which it refers to all sexual attitudes and behaviours in an erotic, or lack of erotic, nature. The relationship between gender and sexuality is not static, it is fluid and changing. In light of this, gendered sexuality does not necessarily follow predictable patterns. Typically, however, gendered sexuality has often followed a heteronormative path, whereby heterosexuality is seen as what Vanwesenbeeck calls a \\"key-site\\" for the intersection between gender and sexuality. Historically, however, these interpretations of sexuality have been riddled with gendered stereotypes, such as men holding more permissive attitudes towards frequent sex and multiple sexual partners, whereas women are more conservative. A study by McCabe, Tanner & Heiman illustrates that gender, at least in the Western world, informs how we understand and conceive of the construct of sexuality. Their study was aimed to discover how men and women gender their meanings of sex and sexuality, if at all, and their results suggest that men and women do talk about sex and sexuality in gendered terms. The most frequent categories of gendering sex/sexuality conversations were: * Sex is only physical for men, and only emotional for women * Sex is more important for men than women * Women's physical appearance is important * Sexual desire and/or pleasure does not significantly apply to women The researchers also commented that these four areas of gendering sexuality occurred among the participants without any suggestions or hints towards these particular subject areas. The researchers conclusions stated that gender, in some way, dictates how we learn and what we know about sex and sexuality. Sexual orientation and gendered sexuality Although gendered sexuality is often viewed through the constructs of male, female and heterosexuality, it can also be used in regard to other gender and sexual variant individuals such as gender dysphoria or those who identify as transgender, transsexual, intersex, homosexual or bisexual. Sociocultural perspective The sociocultural perspective of gendered sexuality holds emphasis on the idea that men and women are social beings informed by the social group of which they are a part, and that the social and cultural aspects of these groups influence the traits prescribed to males and females. The sociocultural perspective deems these traits as performative, in opposition to an evolutionary perspective that describes them through notions of essentialism and innateness. When looking at gendered sexuality through a sociocultural lens, behaviour that is considered appropriate will be influenced by four areas of social interactions: behaviour-related aspects, situation-related aspects, partner(s)-related aspects and subject-related aspects. *Behaviour-related aspects The sexual behaviour that is evaluated most positively will determine what sexual behaviours are most acceptable in relation to gender. These behaviours apply to specific groups, whereby positive evaluations drive what is socially acceptable and therefore, which behaviours drive overall behaviour. In regard to gendered sexuality, Vanwesenbeck suggests that gendered sexual behaviour, if positively accepted by a social group, is more likely to occur within that social group in comparison to if it was negatively evaluated. In regard to a Western context, this can be seen within heterosexuality in males and females. Gendered behavior is also influenced by family units and consumerism. For example, parents may shop for clothing for their son in the \\"boys\\" department. By marketing clothing in this way, the individual's interpretation of sexuality can be externally controlled at an early age. *Situation-related aspects This refers to how gendered behaviour is driven and/or encouraged by the sexual situation within one's direct social community. This sexual situation is referred to by Vanwesenbeeck (2009) as the sexual arena of the individual. Some examples of this could be: a gay bar, a sex club (See Ping pong show), or hip-hop culture. These experiences are all situation-specific in relation to gender and sexuality, and have a different meaning of what is considered as \\"normal\\" depending on the situational construct. Another factor that contributes to situational gendered sexuality is culture and custom. For some nations, it is customary for men and women to behave in certain ways that are considered unacceptable elsewhere. Men holding hands in India is much more acceptable than in the West, and due to these cultural differences, the perception and reaction to sexuality amongst gender varies. *Partner(s)-related aspects Different sexual interactions will determine how much an individual is concerned with conforming to positive societal influences of gender. Studies suggest that increased interactions and strength of gender performativity enacted by one's partner(s) will more strongly influence one's own adherence to gender expectations. The adherence to these gender norms leaves room for unspoken expectations that may create controversy and tension. As an example, it is commonly expected for men to propose marriage to women‚Äînot the other way around. This societal expectation influences the behaviors of men and women seeking marital status. *Subject- related aspects This final postulate rests on the individual, or the subject, and how much a person strives to meet societal gender norms. There are several theories under the label of sociocultural perspectives which have been theorized to influence gendered sexuality. Social role theory Social Role Theory dictates that people are a product of societal social roles set in place via cultural traditions, whereby society instructs all individuals what roles are appropriate for which individuals under particular circumstances. Social role theory can dictate many different types of social roles, in particular, gender roles. These gender roles imply that men and women have their own particular roles assigned to them via their sex, and that these roles are typical and desirable of their particular sex. Gender roles are both restrictive and opportunistic, whereby they dictate an individual's potential through their identification as male or female. In the Western context, this can be seen particularly through the historic gendered division of labour where men and women are fit into different professional roles dictated by their physical capabilities, typically via sex. Vanwesenbeeck suggests that: \\"... It's not the biological potential, or sex, per se that causes gender (role) differences to emerge, but the way society differentially treats these potentials\\" (p. 888). Conformity to these beliefs occurs when others both encourage and accept these behaviours, which in turn, internalizes these gender roles within the minds of men and women throughout a particular group. In a Western context, Eagly & Wood suggest that there are two particular guiding principles of gender role behaviour: # Male-typical gender roles are often given a higher status of power, which labels these types of gender roles as dominant, and all others as marginal (e.g. female-typical gender roles). # All individuals of a particular society will attempt to both obtain and perform the specific components which correspond with their accepted gender role (e.g. women will attempt to perform the roles dictated by female gender roles). Again, in a Western context, these gender roles also carry over to dictate sexual actions and behaviours. For example, a male gender role suggests dominance and aggression, which also carries over into a male sexual role, whereby the male is expected to be sexually dominant and aggressive. These ideologies were inherent within both male and female gendered sexual roles of the 1950s and 60s, whereby a husband was expected to sexually dominate his wife. These roles, however, have changed; there is also strong evidence to suggest that they will continue to change over time. This being said, social role theory, then, seems to also suggests that any non- heterosexual identity does not properly align with these gendered sexual roles and is not as accepted. This is also known as heteronormativity, which can be defined as \\"...the normalising of heterosexual structures and relationships and the marginalisation of everything that doesn't conform\\" (p. 142). Having to maintain an identity that conforms to these gendered sexual roles, however, has not necessarily suggested positive outcomes. Vanwesenbeeck suggests: \\"... restrictive gender norms, which undermine women's power, competence, and agency, help account for women's higher rates of depression, poorer standardized scores on a variety of psychological outcomes, and higher discontent with sex\\" (p. 888). Sexual double standard The sexual double standard is suggested to be a product of social role theory, whereby gendered sex roles are a part of this sexual double standard. Historically, the sexual double standard has suggested that it is both acceptable and even encouraged for men to have sex outside of wedlock, but the same concept does not apply to women. Today, sex outside of wedlock is accepted for both men and women in the majority of the Western world, but for women, this idea is restricted to the spheres of love or engagement. The sexual double standard extends itself further to undermine women, whereby gender roles dictate that all women should be sexual, but sexually humble. It influences female sexual roles in that it suggests that women can never be sexual without being sexually promiscuous. Vanwesenbeeck calls this the whore-madonna distinction. Naomi Wolf author of The Beauty Myth explains \\"Beauty today is what the female orgasm used to be: something given to women by men, if they submitted to their feminine role and were lucky.\\" =Research= In regard to researching gendered sexuality, self- reporting data can often be confounded by social roles, whereby individuals' responses to questions about sexuality will be influenced by one's ability to want to conform to their appropriate social role. Sexuality, in particular, will inform an individual's responses because the area of sexuality is heavily monitored by what are considered normative social roles. Alexander & Fisher conducted a study to determine whether or not men and women's self-reported sexual behaviours and attitudes are influenced by expected gender roles. The self-reported sex differences were mostly found where there was the greatest risk of participants' answers being read by others, and were smallest in the condition where it was believed that participants would most likely tell the truth in order to save themselves from the embarrassment of detected false answers. The results of the study suggest that men and women are influenced by expected gender roles when it comes to sexual behaviours, particularly those considered less acceptable for women than for men, and that they could actually be more similar than previously thought in regard to these behaviours. Social constructionism Social constructionism suggests that what we know to be reality is constructed by social realities that are derived from the history of humankind. Inherent within it is the constructionist paradigm, which has four main points: # One's experiences with the world are ordered in such a way that we can make sense of them # Language provides us with a classification system by which we can understand the world around us # All individuals have what is known as a shared reality of life, whereby we understand how reality differs from dreams by how people, places and other things are organized. We all know and understand this is how people operate. # We understand that the most beneficial way of going about doing something becomes habituated into the human psyche and ultimately becomes a part of our societal institutions. These ways that social lives are constructed influences both gender and sex. Gender is socially constructed by the ways in which one's various everyday interactions with people in a particular culture influenced the external presentation and construction of gender. The social construction of sexuality, on the other hand, is specifically dictated through societal ideologies that limit and restrict what is constructed as appropriate sexual functioning. From this standpoint, sex differences are simply byproducts of men and women attempting to adhere to their prescribed gender construction given to them by their society. Additionally, adhering to these constructions are complicated by a society's technological and situational conditions particular to each culture. It is also important to point out that gendered differences in regard to social construction are also said to be driven by relations of power, typically through patriarchal ideologies which privilege men over women. These power relations influence differences between the genders, which additionally influences variables of sexuality, such as sexual attitudes and behaviours. Similar to social role theory, these constructions are often influenced by physical traits. =Research= The social construction of gendered sexuality is said to be influenced by culture. Petersen & Hyde suggest that there should be a smaller gender difference in regard to attitudes on sexual behaviours in cultures that have smaller gender differences in regard to power (e.g. division of labour between the sexes). They examined their claim by using nationality as a control for gender differences in sexual attitudes and behaviours. Results supported their constructionist claims: the majority of gender differences in sexual behaviours were smaller in Europe, Australia and the USA than in countries with large gender inequalities in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. They concluded that these differences in behaviour can be attributed to the way in which the positions of men and women are constructed within society. Baumeister completed a study that looked at female erotic plasticity, suggesting that women are more susceptible to influence by social and cultural factors in regard to sexuality than men are. His results showed that women had greater sexual variability, lower correlations between sexual attitudes and sexual behaviour for women, and greater influence of social factors on these measures as well. Although Baumeister used an evolutionary approach to explain his findings, Hyde & Durik suggest that a sociocultural approach related to social constructionism is more appropriate. Hyde & Durik pointed out that in Baumeister's Western sample: ‚àó Men have many more levels of power over women than women have over men ‚àó Groups of people who have less power often attempt to acculturate their behaviour to those that are more powerful ‚àó Both gender roles and social constructions influence both men and women's behaviour, particularly in the area of sexuality whereby heterosexuality is expected for both men and women. Although other studies have attempted to replicate Baumeister's findings, no successful replications have yet to be found. Objectification theory The objectification theory focuses on how the body is treated in society, particularly how female bodies are treated like objects. First coined by Fredrickson & Roberts, they initially constructed objectification theory to show how sexual objectification effects women's psychological well-being (Hill & Fischer, 2008). Sexual objectification can be seen particularly through the media via sexual inspection or even sexual violence. This objectification can lead women to look at their bodies as objects to be 'toyed' with, rather than an entity which works to keep an individual alive and functioning optimally. Vanwesekbeeck suggests that this \\"...makes women take distance from their bodies, doubt their bodies' capacities, and results in a lack of experience in using the body effectively\\" (p. 890). Experience of objectification can vary greatly from woman to woman, but has been suggested to considerably effect how a woman experiences her own sexuality. Vanwesekbeeck When women's bodies are more frequently subject to the male gaze, particularly in regard to sexualization, this can lead women to continually police their body image. This creates what Masters and Johnson called spectatoring, whereby women are continuously conscious of their outer body experience, and in doing so, are completely unaware of their inner body experience. Spectatoring is said to decrease women's overall sexual satisfaction. Mass media The majority of sexual objectification comes from the media, be it TV shows, magazines, movies or music videos. Brown suggests that the media impacts the sexual behavior of individuals in three key ways. The First Way- The media takes on the responsibility of keeping sexuality, sexual attitudes, and sexual behaviors at the forefront of the public eye. Take, for example, magazines such as Cosmopolitan or Glamour. The majority of these magazines will have images and headlines intertwined with themes of sexuality with what they should be doing to stay sexy in order to keep their partners sexually interested. These forms of media, in and of themselves, are enforcing compulsory heterosexuality, let alone gendered sexuality. The Second Way- The media serves as an enforcer of gendered sexual norms. Examine, for example, the cultural importances placed on heteronormativity. As proposed by Gayle Rubin, \\"heteronormativity in mainstream society creates a \\"sex hierarchy\\" that graduates sex practices from morally \\"good sex\\" to \\"bad sex.\\" This hierarchy places reproductive monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as \\"good\\" and places any sexual acts and individuals who fall short of this standard lower until they fall into \\"bad sex.\\"\\" The Third Way- The media promotes and encourages the disregarding of the sexually responsible model. Tying back into the previous examples, the media plays upon the assumption that an individual desires acceptance from others. If they display enough promiscuity and sexuality on say the covers of magazines, then eventually people will see that as being the norm and will ignore their social and moral obligations to be responsible with their sexuality. These forms of information from the media have also been suggested to educate the public about sexual roles and portrayals of women, and these influences have been said to have different effects depending on the subgroup. The audience of this form of media, and this type of 'sexual education' is also said to influence some more than others. For example, there is evidence to suggest that teenage girls are most susceptible to these forms of knowledge, impacting female adolescent sexuality. All in all, the structure and foundation of American culture allows for mass media to heavily impact the many different aspects of individualized and gendered sexuality. Health consequences Sexual objectification is said to primarily impact the psychological health of women. It is said to negatively affect young women by instilling shame, doubt and anxiety within them through body spectatoring and policing. These effects are said to potentially lead to even more serious negative mental health complexities, such as depression and sexual dysfunction. Gender inequalities can create health inequalities. For instance, women live longer than men but are considered to be sick five times as frequently as men. Men experience higher rates of fatal illnesses as well as being more frequently injured.http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/socialbehavioralaspectspublichealth/PDFs/Unit2Gender.pdf The construction of gendered sexuality also brings health consequences in the medical community, in regard to mental solidity and physical health effects. In 1984 genital surgery was created for purely aesthetic reasons, but it has only recently in 1998 that it was recognized on a wider scale. Two such medical surgeries are known as vaginoplasty and labiaplasty. The vaginoplasty is used to ‚Äútighten‚Äù the vagina to improves function, and the labiaplasty is done to \\"'enhance' vulval appearance.\\" Throughout time, and through these surgeries, the vagina and female genital is something that is looked at as a problem that needs to be solved if it is not viewed by society as \\"perfect.\\" These surgeries cause insecurities among women, objectifying them and creating a normalized view on their genitals. Women are seen to \\"suffer from comparable feelings of genital anxiety,\\" and will undergo these surgeries, that are acclaimed to be expensive and dangerous, in order to concede to social norms and suppress their anxieties. The pursuit for the \\"optimal vagina\\" consequently damages the health of women in their attempt to form themselves to idealized sexual function and appearance.Rodrigues, Sara.

However, as the fledgling channel sought to build up its subscriber base, (advertising revenue has always been weak given the fractured nature of the target audience) financial support from TVB became increasingly important leading to a rebranding of TCC as TVBS-Europe, (TVB Satellite-Europe ()). Station identification, colours, logos and jingles became variations of that used by TVB for it Jade brand in Hong Kong, and the station was no longer referred to on air or its promotional material as ÊôÇË¶ñ (CC). In 2003, TVB brought out the remaining partner to assume full control of TCC. The company initially shied away from branding itself outright as TVB-Europe; there being a broadcasting industry trade magazine, now owned by NewBay Media, with a similar name, styled TVBEurope. Beginning in 2013 TVB-Europe began moving away from being a satellite broadcaster to being an online one with the goal of a planned switch off of its satellite service in late summer/early autumn of 2014. In late 2013 it began moving existing subscribers to its online service TVB-Anywhere, a TV Everywhere service, with the offer of reduced subscriptions and free set top boxes. The move to becoming an online service followed a period which saw a reduction of the company's physical presence in Europe, for example the closing of its London newsroom at Teddington Studios, with the loss of 20 jobs, and having the news recorded in Hong Kong for broadcast in Europe. The owners declared that it would seek administration for \\"The Chinese Channel Limited\\" on 9 December 2014 because of financial reasons, making its remaining 30 UK and 3 French staff redundant. The subscriber base and the TVB Anywhere service has now been transferred to and is now managed as a part of TVB's TVB International (TVBI).TVB International website Programming From the very start TVB produced programs formed the majority of the channels programming, in addition to TVB programs, Japanese and Korean dramas purchased by TVB, and dubbed for broadcast in Hong Kong, also formed part of the channels early scheduling. In house television program production was limited to local news and community interest programs, this programming ceased with the closing of the local newsroom. As a satellite service TVB-Europe offered 5 channels, the main one being modelled on TVB Jade, in addition to this flagship channel, for an additional supplement to the subscription, four extra channels were available these being a lifestyle channel, a news channel, a golden oldies channel and a children's/educational channel.TVB Television Broadcasts of Hong Kong Selects Eutelsat Eurobird Nine Satellite In addition to material produced by the main TVB studios in Hong Kong, material produced by TVB's Taiwanese subsidiary TVBS was also shown on the extra channels, but very rarely on the main channel. With the rise of online streaming, would be pirates had access to TVB programmes within minutes of their broadcast in Hong Kong, and in a bid to combat this TVB moved to a strategy of same day broadcast of its key television drama serials by its overseas subsidiaries, partners and affiliates. Initially TVB-Europe offered an inclusive package which in addition to the 5 stations previously available by satellite, included multiple channels such as KBS World, Phoenix Television, China Central Television, Eastern Television and other Chinese television stations; in addition to live streaming the TVB-Anywhere service also offered a seven- day catch up service, and a video on demand service. Beginning in 2017, in an effort to fight the cloning of its set top boxes, TVB-Europe replaced its first generation boxes with new ones, these boxes offer a very much reduced number of channels, and there is no longer a dedicated European channel with localised content. The available channels now consist of the TVB Jade, TVBN, TVB Entertainment News and Asian Action channels streamed, simultaneously to their broadcast in Hong Kong, with a fifth channel streaming a repeat of TVB Jade with a seven-hour time delay to scynchronise it with the time in Europe. All third party channels have now been discontinued, and the catch up service is now only for three days. Older TVB programmes as well as dramas from the defunct Asia Television are now available to either buy or be exchanged with loyalty points as part of the video on demand service.

It is based on Mark Twain's 1881 novel The Prince and the Pauper about a poor boy who switches places with Edward, Prince of Wales in Tudor England. For the first time in this Austrian film, a child actor, the Hungarian Tibor Lubinszky, who at eleven years old could already boast a respectable career in cinema, was called to play the double role of protagonist.Holmstrom, John. \\"The Moving Picture Boy: An International Encyclopaedia from 1895 to 1995\\", Norwich, Michael Russell, 15 July 1996, p. 38. Production The film's producer Alexander Kolowrat wanted to emulate the spectacle of Italian costume epics, and was particularly inspired by two recent German films, Madame Dubarry (1919) and Anna Boleyn (1920) by Ernst Lubitsch.Kulik p.29-30 It was Korda's first film after leaving his native Hungary and moving to Austria to work for Sascha-Film. He collaborated with the screenwriter Lajos B√≠r√≥, who had also been forced to leave Hungary, for the first time. They would later work on twenty three more films together.Kulik p.30 Reception The film was largely praised on its release in Britain. Albert Schreiber's portrayal of Henry VIII was particularly praised for avoiding the buffoonery usually associated with the monarch.Kulik p.30 The critical reception was also favourable in Austria, Germany and the United States. The film's American release was delayed due to a legal dispute with an American company which was also planning a film version of the novel. Once it was eventually released it proved to be a great success.Kulik p.30-31 The film's financial success in America inspired Korda towards his later ambitions to make \\"international films\\" which would have global market appeal, a strategy he put into place when working later in Britain which led to the worldwide success of his 1933 film The Private Life of Henry VIII.Kulik p.31 Cast * Tibor Lubinszky as Prince Edward/Tom Canty * Albert Schreiber as Henry VIII * Adolf Weisse as Lord Chancellor * Franz Herterich as John Canty * Franz Everth as Miles Herndon * Wilhelm Schmidt as Hugh Herndon * Ditta Ninjan as Lady Edith * Lilly Lubin as Isabel References Bibliography * Kulik, Karol.

History Born in Sor√∏, Denmark, she studied philosophy, mathematics and chemistry, graduating in 1901. She was the first female to be awarded an M.Sc. at the University of Copenhagen, also. She continued her studies with Walther Nernst in G√∂ttingen, Germany. There she met Emil Bose, a German physicist with whom she married. They moved to Gda≈Ñsk where he was professor and editor of the journal Physikalische Zeitschrift. In the early 1900s there was an initiative to create a top level national university, with a physics institute as a cornerstone, in the city of La Plata, Argentina. Emil Bose was offered the directorship of the institute. He arrived with Margrete in 1909, who was offered a position as well. Together they taught the first experimental physics courses in the country. In 1910 there was a large scientific meeting in Buenos Aires to celebrate the Argentina's centennial with about 1000 participants and Margrete was the only female participant. Shortly after the institute was officially opened, Emil unexpectedly died of typhoid fever in 1911. Although Margrete was the senior physicist at the institution, the authorities decided not to appoint her director, deeming the position unsuitable for a woman. She returned to Germany in 1912 to Nernst's lab for a short stay and then again in 1915, where she had to stay until 1919 because of World War I. Although on leave from the University of La Plata, her position there was canceled due to financial problems. After the war she returned to La Plata and had to file a grievance to get her position back, which she eventually did. She continued her research and mentored many students. She became an Argentine citizen in 1937, and retired in 1941.
