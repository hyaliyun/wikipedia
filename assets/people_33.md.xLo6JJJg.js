He competed in the 3 m springboard and 10 m platform at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics, at the 1950, 1954 and 1958 British Empire Games, and at the 1954 European Championships. He won five British Empire Games medals and one European medal, while his best Olympic result was fifth place in 1948. Heatly was knighted in 1990, before being inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2002, the Scottish Swimming Hall of Fame in 2010 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2016.  Early life  Born in Leith on Coburg Street, Heatly was educated at Leith Academy and began his diving career with Portobello Amateur Swimming Club (PASC). He was inspired to become a diver after watching Pete Desjardins dive at Port Seton. Heatly was eleven years old, and Desjardins asked to see him dive and gave him tips. By the age of thirteen Heatly had become the East of Scotland Champion (1937), and he held this title until the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The outbreak of war put things on hold; however, Heatly became a record holder in the 440-yards and 880-yards during this time. Heatly studied engineering at the University of Edinburgh and continued to train with PASC. Heatly wanted to enlist; however, as he was doing well with his studies at University, he was advised to join the Officers' Training Corps instead. When he graduated from University, he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, but before he could be posted, the war ended. Healty became an apprentice at Rosyth's Naval Dockyard; however, he kept up his training at the sports facilities nearby and became a Scottish Freestyle Champion in 1946, a title he kept until 1958. Heatly married Jean Hermiston in 1948; he ran the family business of heating and ventilation, and a building and construction company while competing internationally and raising his four children.  International competitions  At the 1948 Olympics, Heatly placed fifth in the platform and 13th in the springboard. At the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, New Zealand, he won a gold medal in the platform and a silver in the springboard. Heatly had been unable to practise for most of the five-week journey by ship to Auckland, except for one training session which took place in a U.S. base in Panama. At the 1952 Olympics, Heatly placed 12th in the platform and 16th in the springboard. At the 1954 Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, Canada, he won a gold in the springboard and a bronze in the platform. The same year he won a bronze in the platform at the European championships. At the 1958 Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales, Heatley was appointed as captain and flagbearer for the Scotland Team. He won a gold medal in the platform, and retired from competitions after that.  Later life  Heatly became the Chairman of Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland (now Commonwealth Games Scotland), in 1967‚Äì1971, Chairman of the Scottish Sports Council, (now sportscotland), in 1975‚Äì87, and Chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation, in 1982‚Äì90. Heatly has a unique connection with the Commonwealth Games as he has consecutively attended seventeen games, from 1950 to 2014, in an official capacity as a competitor, organiser, Chairman of the Federation, as the Life Vice President of the Federation, team manager and Chef de Mission. Healty was also the President of Scottish Swimming on two separate occasions, Chairman of the British Swimming Federation, was a Councillor for the City of Edinburgh and was an integral part of the planning of the Royal Commonwealth Pool.

Biography Wang Yi Guang was born in Yimeng Mountain area of Shandong, China. He is a younger brother of another notable painter, Wang Yidong (ÁéãÊ≤Ç‰∏ú). He graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing in 1990. He participated in various national and international exhibitions and art fairs in Beijing, Guangzhou, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Wang Yi Guang currently works as a creative designer for the China Railway Construction Corporation. In 2002 they worked on the Qinghai - Tibet railway. The painter was struck by the \\"humble beauty\\" of the Tibet. He wrote: :I have been able to visit the Tibetan plateau a number of times. I've been deeply touched by the breathtaking landscape of Tibet and the happy-go-lucky spirit of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people's profound regard for the natural world and animals has also cast a life-long impression on me. Their unwavering optimism, all- encompassing and peaceful way of life, are in extreme contrast with the psychological states of modern city dwellers. In my works of life on the Tibetan Plateau, I focus more on movement, so as to convey the beauty of extreme tension and moments of life. When I was in Tibet, I spent a lot of my time lying down in the grass, as I suffered from acute mountain sickness. As I lay there gasping for air, a delightful picture revealed itself before me: a couple of young, spry Tibetan girls racing about the countryside with their herd of yaks. These Tibetan girls reminded me of 'Feitian', the flying Devi (literally: 'goddess')*, when they are still earthly beings. The fairy tale relationship between man and yak, also called \\"ship of the plateau\\", came to life right before my eyes. In my series of paintings on the Tibetan plateau, I try to convey the unique psychological journey I experienced during this time. Similarly, these feelings surfaced through long periods of \\"observing and reflecting\\". This dream-like state has in turn added a romantic dimension to my works, which can be seen in paintings such as \\"Sun in a Distant Place\\" and \\"Towards the Sun\\". By applying surrealistic elements the transfer of images can be fully articulated. :In my oil paintings I try and convey my feelings for a target, as though I were encountering it for the first time. I do this by trying to capture its characteristics and intrinsic humour. I believe that painters should integrate their own impression of a certain experience, observation and/or response in their work so as to create expressive images. The Tibetan works were exhibited in 2004 on a solo exhibition \\"Retrospective of Tibet - The Spirit and Movement\\" at the Schoeni Art Gallery of Hong Kong.

USPAP, as it is commonly known, was first developed in the 1980s by a joint committee representing the major U.S. and Canadian appraisal organizations. As a result of the savings and loan crisis, the Appraisal Foundation (TAF) was formed by these same groups, along with support and input from major industry and educational groups, and TAF took over administration of USPAP.The Appraisal Foundation The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) authorized the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC), which is made up of representatives of the leading U.S. government agencies and non-governmental organizations empowered to oversee the U.S. mortgage and banking system. The ASC provides oversight to TAF. TAF carries out its work through two divisions ‚Äì the Appraisal Standards Board (ASB) and the Appraiser Qualifications Board (AQB). The latter group sets forth minimum qualifications for appraisal licensure, and its work has been adopted by all states and territories. The ASB maintains USPAP, and issues updates in January of even numbered years. All US states and territories require appraisal licensure for valuation work performed for federally regulated institutions; however, 35 states and territories of the US require appraisal licensure for all valuation work performed, whether federally regulated or for other use. Since 2006, USPAP has been updated in a 2-year cycle, which begins on January 1 of even number years. The current version of USPAP is available at www.appraisalfoundation.org and has an effective date of January 1, 2020. Origins USPAP was originally written in 1986-87 by an ad hoc committee representing the various appraisal professional organizations in the U.S. and Canada. The copyright to USPAP was donated to TAF on April 27, 1987. While USPAP answers a specific regulatory need in the U.S., it has also been adopted by many appraisal professional organizations throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia. USPAP represents the generally accepted and recognized standards of appraisal practice. At its organizational meeting held on January 30, 1989, the Appraisal Standard Board (ASB) unanimously approved and adopted the original USPAP as the initial appraisal standards promulgated by ASB. USPAP may be amended, Interpreted, or retired by ASB after exposure to the users of appraisal services and the public in accordance with established rules of procedure. Over the years, the USPAP document has evolved in content and organisational structure in response to changes in appraisal practice. The ASB has developed a process for developing both standards and guidance based, in part, on written comments submitted in response to exposure drafts and oral testimony. Standards vs. methods While USPAP provides a minimum set of quality control standards for the conduct of appraisal in the U.S., it does not attempt to prescribe specific methods to be used. Rather, USPAP simply requires that appraisers be familiar with and correctly utilize those methods which would be acceptable to other appraisers familiar with the assignment at hand and acceptable to the intended users of the appraisal. USPAP directs this through what is called the Scope of Work rule. At the onset of an assignment, an appraiser is obligated to gather certain specified preliminary data about the project, such as the nature of the property to be appraised, the basis of value (e.g. market, investment, impaired, unimpaired), the interests appraised (e.g. fee, partial), important assumptions or hypothetical conditions, and the effective date of the valuation. Based on this and other key information, the appraiser relies on peer-reviewed methodology to formulate an acceptable workplan. Standards, statements, and advisory opinions USPAP has ten Standards which cover the development and reporting of valuation. In addition, over the years, ten Statements regarding specific practices in appraisal have been developed, however, all ten have since been retired. Standards and Statements are considered binding. In addition, there are 32 Advisory Opinions which are advisory rather than binding. International Valuation Standards USPAP and the International Valuation Standards [IVS] aim at essentially the same goals. There has been cooperation between TAF and the International Valuation Standards Council (IVSC) over an extended period. In June, 2006, the IVSC and TAF jointly issued a memorandum of understanding (MoU), called the \\"Madison Agreement\\", in which they pledged to work together toward the goal of reconciling the differences between the two sets of standards.Press release announcing the Madison Agreement In 2014, this was updated with a new MoU under which the parties committed to work to remove any remaining differences between the standards that would prevent an appraiser following USPAP also complying with the requirements of the IVS. In 2016, \\"A Bridge from USPAP to IVS\\" was produced to assist appraisers familiar with USPAP to produce a valuation that is also compliant with the IVS. While the document describes additional steps necessary to ensure that compliance, a full review of both sets standards is always encouraged. Both organizations note that this joint effort unveiled more commonalities than differences in the two sets of standards.TAF International Activities  References  External links *http://www.uspap.org Category:Real estate valuation ","title":"Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice"},{"id":"11809069","text":"The States is a 2007 American documentary television series about the history of each state in the United States of America, narrated by Edward Herrmann. The show documents each of the 50 states in the union. The show begins with an introduction to the five states to be documented within the episode. Each state's segment begins with the narrator giving a clue as to what that state might be, and then revealing the answer. ( e.g. \\"There is a North Dakota and a South Dakota, a North Carolina and a South Carolina, but there's been one \\"West\\" anything! Welcome to West Virginia.\\") There is then a billboard that pops up showing the state nickname, motto, population, population ranking within the union, date the state entered the union, and state flag. During interviews with historians or notable people from a state, the state's quarter is shown. Since the series was produced in 2007, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, and Hawaii are shown with their flags. Those quarters were released in 2008 The show then highlights the history of the state itself, including notable events that have happened there, and highlights other noteworthy things in that state. In 2010 a sister presentation and then series, How the States Got Their Shapes was aired.

It was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Sh≈çnen Ace between January 26, 2006 and December 25, 2010, and has been collected into 12 tank≈çbon volumes. The plot depicts the Diary Game, a deadly battle royal between 12 different individuals who are given \\"Future Diaries\\", special diaries that can predict the future, by Deus Ex Machina, the God of Time and Space, with the last survivor becoming his heir. The manga has been licensed by Tokyopop, and ten of the English volumes were released, with a release for the last two now uncertain due to Tokyopop ceasing publishing in North America. A \\"pilot anime\\" DVD was released with the 11th manga volume in December 2010. A 26-episode anime television series produced by Asread, aired in Japan between October 2011 and April 2012. Funimation has licensed the anime for distribution in North America. An 11-episode live-action television drama aired between April and June 2012. Esuno has also authored three side-story manga, each one spanning five chapters: first Future Diary: Mosaic which focuses on another Diary Holder, Minene Uryu, and tells unrevealed plot points of the main story; in 2009-2010, Future Diary: Paradox (published in Young Ace), which tells the exploits of Aru Akise and Muru Muru set in an alternate timeline, and in 2013, Future Diary: Redial, which serves as an epilogue to the series. Plot Yukiteru Amano () is a 14-year-old, shy and daydreaming loner who observes life and jots down the events on his cell phone. His only friends are Deus Ex Machina (), the God of Space and Time, and his assistant Muru Muru (). Deus transforms Yukiteru's phone into a Future Diary, capable of predicting the future up to ninety days. Yukiteru discovers he and eleven others are part of a survival game orchestrated by Deus. The aim of this game is to eliminate the other diary holders, the winner succeeding Deus as god and can prevent the Apocalypse. Yukiteru finds himself protected by Yuno Gasai (), a charming but psychopathic classmate who obsessively stalks him after they promised to go stargazing together a year before. Two major players they encounter are terrorist Minene Uryu, who wants to destroy all religion after her parents died in a faith-fuelled war; and Keigo Kurusu, a police officer who wants to end the game. Later, Kurusu betrays Yukiteru and Yuno when he discovers his bed-ridden son is suffering from a terminal illness. He assassinates diary holder Karyuudo Tsukishima and frames Yukiteru and Yuno. Minene turns to detective Masumi Nishijima, exposing Kurusu's crime. In his shame, Kurusu eliminates himself from the game. John Bacchus, the city's mayor and designer of the Future Diaries, tries to manipulate Yukiteru's debt-ridden father Kurou into stealing his son's diary. Kurou fails, unintentionally murdering his ex- wife Rea, and is then assassinated by Bacchus' men. Yukiteru vows to win the game and resurrect his parents. He and Yuno target the remaining diary holders, Minene, Bacchus, and Kamado Ueshita who runs an orphanage. Meanwhile, Yukiteru's astute friend Aru Akise, and Nishijima investigate the discovery of three corpses in Yuno's house, two being her parents, and the third identified as being Yuno Gasai, bringing her identity into question. Kamado's diary, which can give others substitute diaries, is connected to a supercomputer, giving everyone in the city Future Diaries as part of Bacchus' plan to help humanity evolve. Yukiteru and Yuno, Minene, Nishijima, and Yukiteru's friends storm Bacchus' headquarters. He seals himself in a bank vault owned by Yuno's parents, her fingerprints the only way to access it. Minene sacrifices herself to destroy the vault but fails, only for Aru to witness Yuno access the vault and kill Bacchus. Wanting answers, Aru confronts Deus who reveals the boy is an artificial human designed to observe the game and keep it in balance, but confirms there is a conspiracy around Yuno. Yukiteru murders his friends and then Kamado. Aru battles Yuno, destroying her diary but discovers she has a spare. Realising the truth, Aru shows a text to Yukiteru before Yuno decapitates him. As the days to the Apocalypse approach, Yukiteru and Yuno consummate their relationship. However, Yukiteru reveals Aru's suggestion that Yuno originates from another timeline and she immediately turns on him. Muru Muru, the true mastermind behind the game's course, confirms Aru's theory. Yukiteru died and Yuno won the game in another timeline but discovered not even the power of a god could bring back the dead. In her sorrow, Yuno went back in time, creating an alternate timeline, murdering and replacing her other self. Yuno and Muru Muru go back in time again, creating a third world, pursued by Yukiteru and Minene, kept alive by Deus as a wild card and imbued with a portion of his power. Both parties battle to protect or kill the third world's Yuno and her parents. Yuno, unable to kill Yukiteru, traps him in a dream world where she doesn't exist, and then attacks her alternate self. Yukiteru remembers Yuno, escaping his prison aided by the second world's Muru Muru, and stops Yuno. Though Yukiteru asks Yuno to kill him so she can live, she instead eliminates herself and dies in his arms. Yukiteru becomes god and is dragged to the second world by Muru Muru. Ten-thousand years later, a mournful Yukiteru has done nothing with his godly powers. He managed to cut off all influences that the first and second worlds had with the third and prevents the third world's deus from dying. Yukiteru gazes at his diary, mourning that he will never see the first world Yuno, the only one he will ever love, ever again. However, the interdimensional walls are broken down by the third world Yuno, who possesses the first world's memories courtesy of an atoning Muru Muru. Yukiteru and Yuno reunite as gods of the second world and eternal lovers.

History Katchal Island was previously known as Tihanyu. Due to the remote location and lack of exposure with the rest of the world, outsiders economically exploited the innocent islanders for a long time. To stop their economic exploitation, the Government of India declared the Nicobar Islands an Aboriginal Tribal Reserve Area (ATRA) on 2 April 1957. This made the Nicobar Islands inaccessible to outsiders and currently even Indian nationals need a special tribal pass to visit the islands. Only Government Servants (outsiders) posted to Katchal Islands are allowed to stay in the island. Nicobar Islands have experienced all kinds of external influences for centuries, because they are located along an ancient international sea trade route and have been known to voyagers and scholars since ancient times. Due to this, the islands have been receiving external influences, which have affected their culture and race over the centuries. According to recent history, an archeological inscription dating to AD 1059 says that Nicobar was part of the overseas kingdom of Tamil Chola King of Tanjore. In 1869, the British took possession of the Nicobar Islands from the Danes and made them a part of modern India. At sunrise on 1 January 2000, Katchal Island was in the news. Many rich and famous people from around the world had converged on it for a glimpse of the millennium's first sunrise. Katchal was one of the worst affected islands during the December 26th 2004 Tsunami. The tsunami devastated the Island, disturbing the socio-economic set-up of its inhabitants. Of the 5,000 people missing (5000 is official - actual is more) in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 1,549 were believed to be from Katchal. To support the local population a sizable number of Govt. Staffs were posted to this Island prior to the Tsunami day. Most of the staff went missing as majority of the Govt. provided Staff Quarters were situated very close to the sea shore and a very few managed to escape to the nearby hill. To cite an example - not a single teacher out of 47 posted here prior on 26-11-2004 was found alive. Some people managed to escape the waters by clinging over to coconut tree tops. Of the 344 people reported dead, only one body could be identified. Either the bodies were decomposed beyond recognition or there were no survivors to claim them.Life as Medical Officer @ Katchal-Post Tsunami Geography Its area is . It is approximately away from mainland (India) and south to capital Port Blair. The highest peak of Katchal is high. The hills of Katchal are composed of calcareous sandstone and marble slates, and in the tropical forest of Katchal there are many pythons, black monkeys and pigs. Demography Katchal Island is home to both indigenous and non-indigenous people. Katchal is inhabited by Nicobari Tribes and Migrated Tamilians (For Rubber plantation workers under Sastri-Srimao Bandaranayaka Pact of 1964). After the tsunami almost all the tribal chiefs and their heirs were killed, leaving the tribes virtually headless. Katchal is the largest island of the central group of islands and had 35 villages (of which six were main villages). After the tsunami, the natives regrouped and formed five tribal villages in the island viz. E-Wall, Meenakshi Ram Nagar, Japan Tikrey, Sallo Tikrey, and Upper Katchal. Mildera is another village in the island inhabited by non tribal people (Tamil repatriates and Ranchi communities).Kathchal Map Languages spoken in Katchal are Nicobarese, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Santali.

Background Bingham attended the University of North Carolina and University of Virginia but did not graduate. He moved to Louisville in the 1890s and received a law degree from the University of Louisville in 1897. He formed his own practice with W.W. Davies. Bingham married into a wealthy family in 1896. He became involved in Louisville politics as a registered Democrat, and was appointed interim mayor of the city in 1907 after election fraud invalidated the 1905 election. His corruption- busting tactics in his 6-month term alienated him from the local political machine and the Democratic Party in general, and he chose not to run in the general election. He ran unsuccessfully for the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1910 as a Republican, and as a Democrat for Fiscal Court in 1917. He was appointed to the Jefferson Circuit Court in 1911, and was known as \\"Judge Bingham\\" for the rest of his life. Controversial inheritance Bingham's first wife Eleanor Miller died in 1913. She was a passenger with her children in a car driven by her brother. Accounts vary, but either the car was crossing railroad tracks and was hit by a speeding commuter trainMarie Brenner, House of Dreams: The Bingham Family of Louisville. Random House, 1988. or Eleanor jumped out of the car as it crossed the tracks. Her father Samuel Miller had committed suicide in this manner nineteen years earlier. Her son Barry later said he could remember Eleanor pushing him out of her lap and jumping from the car.Sallie Bingham, Passion and Prejudice. Knopf, 1989. She was survived by three children: Robert Norwood Bingham (his middle name was later changed to Worth, making him Robert Worth Bingham Jr), George Barry Bingham, and Henrietta Worth Bingham.William Elliot Ellis, Robert Worth Bingham and the Southern Mystique, The Kent State University Press, 1997, pg. 53. In 1916 Bingham married Mary Lily Flagler, reputedly the wealthiest woman in America at the time and widow of Henry Morrison Flagler. She died within a year, and although there was never any evidence of it, Bingham's enemies and some of his relatives would long claim he was somehow to blame for her death. As the family business crumbled publicly in the 1980s, several biographers, most notably David Leon Chandler and Mary Lily's step-granddaughter Sallie Bingham claimed Bingham had killed his wife for the money, either by overdose or withholding medical care. Immediately before falling ill, Mary Lily had added a codicil to her will, giving Bingham five million dollars outright (rather than the investment fund for him she had originally planned). Allegations of murder haunted Bingham for many years.Augustus Mayhew, Fatal Fortunes: The Flagler-Kenan-Bingham Triangle. Review of Irrepressible: The Jazz Age Life of Henrietta Bingham, in New York Social Diary, September 4, 2015.Emily Bingham's Irrepressible: The Jazz Age Life of Henrietta Bingham (Farrar Straus Giroux 2015), cites more documentation about Mary Lily's death, including evidence on both sides, although she believes Robert was innocent. According to her research, many people at the time -- including Theodore Roosevelt -- assumed Robert had murdered his wife and gotten away with it. While acknowledging these theories were at least plausible, more mainstream sources, from the Filson Club's respected quarterly publication to The New York Times, dismissed the allegations as impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, as Bingham inherited $5 million after her death, enabling him to purchase The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, which became critical in establishing his later national prominence, it made an attractive conspiracy theory. Bingham's son, Barry Bingham, Sr., argued that Flagler was an alcoholic who drank herself to death, a theory supported by an affidavit from her family doctor given in 1933. Later career Using the bequest from Flagler, Bingham purchased the Courier-Journal and Times in 1918. He immediately clashed with long-time editor Henry Watterson, who soon retired. In the 1920s Bingham used the paper to push for farm cooperatives, improve education and support of the rural poor, and to challenge the state's Democratic Party bosses. In the latter endeavor he became an ally of U.S. Sen. J. C. W. Beckham, who had been governor in 1900-07. Bingham himself was, earlier in his career, discouraged from running for mayor due to the likelihood of heavy opposition from the likes of Democratic party boss John Whallen, and had bitterly described the unfairness of machine tactics he witnessed used against other candidates. He was among reform-minded Democrats who successfully backed Republican Augustus E. Willson of Louisville for governor in 1907. Bingham married his third wife, Aleen Lithgow Hilliard, in 1924. A strong financial backer of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Bingham was awarded with ambassadorship to Great Britain in 1933, and took up his post in May. As ambassador, Bingham pushed for stronger ties between the United States and Great Britain, and vocally opposed the rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1930s, a time when Roosevelt would not because of political concerns at home. He was succeeded in the post by Joseph P. Kennedy. He was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, Society of Colonial Wars and the Sons of the American Revolution. His daughter Henrietta Bingham was involved with the Bloomsbury Group, having affairs with the painter Dora Carrington and later with the sculptor Stephen Tomlin, who went on to marry Julia Strachey, niece of Lytton Strachey, the love of Carrington's life.Extended Review: The Letters of Lytton Strachey Seriously ill, Bingham sailed back to the United States on November 19, 1937. He died a month later, on December 18, 1937, from Hodgkin's lymphoma, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he had been operated on a few days before his death; and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery. His family continued to dominate Louisville media for another half-century, mostly through his son, Barry Bingham, Sr. The SS Robert W. Bingham, a cargo ship in service from 1944 to 1959, was named for him.

He was a member of Crowley‚Äôs A‚à¥A‚à¥ and is often referred to by one of the magical names that he used in that Order: Frater Progradior, (Progradior is an approximation of the Latin for \\"I advance\\").Keith Richmond, Progradior and the Beast, p. 145. Early life Bennett was born in Worsley, Lancashire, England. He worked variously as a builder, industrial chemist, and factory manager, and in later life, as a caretaker and maintenance supervisor. During his earlier years he was involved in a number of esoteric movements, including the Theosophical Society and Universal Co-Freemasonry (now known as Co-Masonry: a mixed-sex version of Freemasonry). He got in touch with Crowley in 1909 through The Equinox newsletter, asking for information on the Abramelin operation.Aleister Crowley et al., The Progradior Correspondence, pp. 3-8. Career Not long after, he joined Crowley‚Äôs A‚à¥A‚à¥ and later the O.T.O. In spite of his interest in Crowley, Bennett kept his ties with Co- Masonry and in 1911 emigrated to Australia, with the specific purpose of assisting in the foundation of Co-Masonic Lodges, a task he undertook with some success.Keith Richmond, Progradior and the Beast, pp. 48 - 67. He eventually settled in Sydney, where he was joined by his wife and children. Frank Bennett‚Äôs interest in Co-Masonry waned, and he resigned from the Sydney Lodge, of which he was Past Grand Master, after a dispute over its management. In 1914 he renewed contact with the O.T.O. and after lengthy negotiations he received a charter to run the first O.T.O. Lodge in Australia in November 1915. The lodge was named \\"Sydney Rosicrucian Lodge,\\" and for technical reasons was listed as \\"Lodge No. 2 on the Register of the National Grand Council of the Ordo Templi Orientis for the Union of South Africa\\"‚ÄôKeith Richmond, Progradior and the Beast, pp. 99 - 100. A photograph of the original charter is reproduced between pages 114 ‚Äì 115. Throughout the years of the First World War Bennett sought to grow the O.T.O. and the A.‚Äô. A.‚Äô. in Australia, holding regular lectures which he advertised in newspapers. He corresponded regularly with Crowley and Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones) who supervised his studies in the A.‚Äô. A.‚Äô. It was as a Neophyte under Achad‚Äôs mentorship that he adopted the name \\"Progradior\\" ‚Äì which would become the best known of his magical names. In July 1921, Bennett traveled to the recently founded Abbey of Thelema in Cefal√π where he began personal studies under Crowley. There he joined a small number of Thelemic luminaries including Leah Hirsig, Cecil Frederick Russell, Jane Wolfe, and others. Crowley was greatly impressed with Bennett‚Äôs enthusiasm and aptitude, and specifically rewrote an initiatory text: Liber Samekh, a ritual for attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, for Bennett to use during a magical retreat (\\"magical retirement.\\") Frank Bennett kept a detailed account of his experiences during this retreat which has since been published as The Magical Record of Frater Progradior.The text of Bennett‚Äôs \\"Magical Record\\" is published in Keith Richmond (Editor) The Magical Record of Frater Progradior & Other Writings by Frank Bennett, pp. 37 -91. Crowley was immensely impressed with Bennett‚Äôs achievements, and came to consider him as a star pupil. He formally admitted Bennett to the Ninth Degree of the O.T.O. and officially appointed him as his \\"Viceroy in Australasia.\\"A photograph of Bennett‚Äôs original certificate, signed by Crowley and Leah Hirsig is reproduced between pages 218 ‚Äì 219 of Progradior and the Beast. Crowley also advanced Bennett rapidly through the grades of the A.‚Äô. A.‚Äô., with Bennett taking the Oath of an Adeptus Minor in October 1921. Personal life When Frank Bennett returned to Australia in December 1921 he was ill with malaria and had also acquired a heroin addiction. He also returned to domestic troubles: his wife was on the verge of leaving him, and when she did so his son, Frank Bennett Jr. sided with her, and never reconciled with his father. For a time Bennett lost contact with Crowley and the Thelemites, but eventually recommenced his correspondence with Crowley and his Scarlet Woman, Alostrael (Leah Hirsig) and renewed his attempts to spread Crowley‚Äôs teachings (the Law of Thelema). In 1924 a Sydney newspaper, Smith's Weekly, ran a series of scandalous expos√©s on Bennett and the O.T.O. Under pressure from family, and afraid of losing his job, Bennett withdrew from the public gaze, and the Sydney O.T.O. and A.‚Äô. A.‚Äô. groups ‚Äì which had probably only ever attracted a tiny membership - appear to have dissolved. Following the closure of the Abbey of Thelema in Cefal√π Aleister Crowley, Leah Hirsig and the other members of the small core group of Thelemites dispersed, and Frank Bennett slowly drifted out of contact with them. Death Bennett died in November 1930, after a short illness. Works A collection of Frank Bennett‚Äôs writings, including his \\"Magical Record\\" has been published, and he is also the subject of the full-length biographical study Progradior and the Beast.

Positioned at the eastern head of the Bega Valley, 25 kilometres (15 miles) from the base of Brown Mountain (1241m), a spur of the Great Dividing Range, the locality is bordered by the mountains and ridges of the South East Forests National Park. Prominent features in the Bemboka section to the north include Indian Head, Pigeon Box, Bemboka Peak and Numbugga Walls. History The first inhabitants of the region were a sub- group of the Thaua people of the Yuin nation. The first European settlers were squatters grazing sheep and cattle on crown land beyond the limits of location set by the NSW Government in 1829. The first purchases of land by selectors occurred in 1862 and the first school was established on Brown Mountain in 1871. Settlement occurred in two adjacent villages ‚Äì Colombo and the private subdivision of Lyttleton. The two towns remained relatively isolated until the bridle trail on Brown Mountain used to carry post was upgraded in 1889 to take vehicles, providing an effective means of descent from the Monaro to the coastal plain. Colombo was regazetted as Bemboka in 1894, and Lyttleton was incorporated into the village in 1923. From 1904 to 1911, the town had its own weekly newspaper, the Bemboka Advocate. It was also the location of the former Mumbulla Shire administration offices from 1906 until the Bega Valley Shire was formed in 1981. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 577 people in Bemboka. 81.5% of people were born in Australia and 89.9% of people only spoke English at home, The most common responses for religion were No Religion 36.2%, Catholic 18.1% and Anglican 17.4%. Economy The town economy is based on dairying. In the late 1890s there were six known butter and cheese factories in the area. These were superseded by cooperatives, with the Bemboka Co-operative Factory at the east end of town remaining in business until 1980. During the 1980s and 1990s, the old cheese factory building was used by Bemboka Handmade Paper Pty Ltd to make quality handmade paper that was marketed worldwide. Bemboka is notable for retaining most of its older timber buildings. These include the stores which once lined the main street, some of which are now used as private homes. The original Bemboka Pie Shop built in 1930 still operates as a bakery and pie shop with a reputation built from a long history of providing refreshment to motorists coming down to the coast from the Monaro and ACT. In the surrounding state forests, woodchipping and logging was a major industry until the late 1980s, when activism by conservationists resulted in the reservation of 15,300 hectares as Bemboka National Park. In 1997, this area was merged into the South East Forests National Park. Community For a small community, the people of Bemboka have a history of working together to achieve big things. From 1956‚Äì1967, the village ran its own weekly picture show in the School of Arts Hall using the school's 16 millimetre projector, to raise money to build the current Bemboka Memorial Hall. During the 1970s, the village raised funds through housie nights, catering and grants to build a swimming pool in the town. Most recently, Bemboka has become known for its banquet, a community initiative of the Bemboka Show Society, which in 2012 served 150 guests a four course dinner of five entrees, five main courses, five desserts and five cheeses, with 90 per cent of ingredients sourced from within 10 kilometres of the Bemboka Memorial Hall.

She was built in the Admiralty Shipyard at Saint Petersburg, Russia. The new class was a major improvement on previous Russian cruisers, although the armor protection was light. Background The Pallada class consisted of three cruisers built expressly with the intention of strengthening the Russian fleet in the Far East. Pallada and were both laid down in December 1895 but Pallada was launched first in August 1899, followed by Diana in October 1899. , which survives in Saint Petersburg as a museum ship, was laid down in June 1897 and was not launched until May 1900. Soon after commissioning, both Pallada and Diana were assigned to the Russian First Pacific Squadron at Port Arthur, Manchuria. Operational history Torpedoing of Pallada (artist's conception). Pallada sunk at Port Arthur In the initial Japanese attacks on Port Arthur on the night of 8 February 1904, Pallada was torpedoed on the port side amidships, but despite a fire in her coal bunker, she was not seriously damaged. In August 1904 at the Battle of the Yellow Sea, after being struck by a torpedo, Pallada managed to make her way back to Port Arthur, and was thus unable to break through the Japanese blockade along with a number of other Russian cruisers. Thereafter, Pallada was trapped in the harbor. Her guns were removed to help strengthen the land defenses and most of her crew was reassigned to serve as infantry. Pallada was sunk by Japanese 11-inch siege howitzers on 8 December 1904. After the end of the war, the wreck of Pallada was raised and towed to Japan, where it was repaired and commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as a prize of war. Renamed , she served as a training vessel and later as a minelayer until decommissioned in 1922 and sunk as a target in 1924. References * Chesneau, Roger and Eugene M Kolesnik, eds.

The clan's progenitors were an English trader and agent, John Tucker, and a Sherbro princess. Starting in the 17th Century, the Tuckers ruled over one of the most powerful chiefdoms in the Sherbro country of Southern Sierra Leone, centered on the village of Gbap. Clan History In the 1620s, England had a number of agents in the Sherbro region of Sierra Leone; these traders were looking for camwood, ivory, and other such items, and traded with the locals. They were also looking for slaves to fulfill a growing demand for slave labor in the West. In the late 17th century, the Gambia Adventurers and the Royal African Company began sending many agents to the region. In 1665, an agent in the service of the Gambia Adventurers called John Tucker left England and went to Sierra Leone alongside Zachary Rogers (progenitor of the Afro-European clan the Rogers). Upon arriving in Sherbro Country, John Tucker and Zachary Rogers took the daughters of a Sherbro chief as their wives as was customary in order to gain trading rights in the region. Being a matrilineal society, the descendants of John Tucker were able to maintain claims to the chieftaincy throne. The children of John Tucker and the Sherbro princess gained control of their mother's kingdom and utilised their father's name. Politically, the Tuckers would become one of the most influential and prominent Sherbro families during the 17th and 18th centuries, and were able to expand their powerful chiefdom into other territories. Although they maintained European connections (some of them going to England to attend school), they remained thoroughly 'Africanised' taking part in local cultural institutions such as the Poro Society. It was only through such local institutions that they were able to gain control over more territory. Besides maintaining claims to chieftaincy, some Tucker descendants became powerful traders and middlemen between African and European business interests. Their strong ties to European culture and language helped them expand their influence over the Sherbro trade industry. Particularly in the Southern Sierra Leone slave trade, members of Afro-European clans such as the Rogers, the Caulkers, and the Tuckers played an integral role as middlemen, allowing them to accumulate material wealth as an emergent merchant class. In the mid-19th Century, The American Missionary Association joined the British colonial project by evangelizing in the Hinterland, with a zeal spurred on by The Amistad Revolt. On land granted to Sengbe Pieh and the Amistad returnees, the association would go on to establish an American Mission School in territory under the control of Sherbro Chief Harry Tucker. Graduates of such schools would go on to secondary schools such as Albert Academy and The Harford School in Moyamba. After receiving a Western education at such schools locally, hinterland youth, including many Tucker descendants would become integrated into the colonial government apparatus. Along with Freetown's Krios, such Western-educated hinterland youth would also help in the negotiations of Sierra Leone's independence.

Life and times Born Jorge Antonio Chibene in La Boca, Buenos Aires to Syrian immigrants (his father was an √©migr√© who arrived in Argentina from Syria in the 19th century, and whose name was Elias Antun Esquef), Antonio grew up in Uruguay and returned to Argentina at 17 years of age. He was an orderly at the National Military Academy in 1942, and worked in several enterprises before being appointed as the representative of General Motors and Mercedes Benz in Argentina. In this post, in 1949 he met Per√≥n again, having first met him briefly in 1943, and would become one of Per√≥n's most important advisers. Antonio's fortune grew, connected with his friendship with Juan Duarte, Per√≥n's brother-in-law. In the 1950s, Antonio bought the media companies Radio Belgrano, Canal 7 and the T√©lam agency. He also invested in agribusiness and owned a bank, building his importance to the Presidency. It was reported that his fortune grew in the ten years to 1955 to US$215 million, and to opponents, Antonio's wealth became emblematic of the cronyism Per√≥n encouraged during his Presidency. Among his employees was Adolf Eichmann, under his assumed name of Ricardo Clement. Antonio admitted that he knew Eichmann's real identity. He was often linked with stories of 'Nazi Gold', money brought to Argentina, the United States, and other safe havens by Nazis fleeing Germany. When Per√≥n was deposed by the military coup of September 1955, Antonio refused to leave the country and was arrested. He was imprisoned for 17 days on a boat, then in Ushuaia for a month and later in R√≠o Gallegos for two years. His properties were seized, and stolen with corrupted judges, by the military. In March 1957, with other Peronist leaders, he escaped from the prison and took refuge in Chile. He was able to fight off Argentine extradition appeals and eventually the government of Chile granted him asylum. In the following years, he lived in Cuba and then in Spain, where he lived for 20 years. Despite animosity from Per√≥n's wife, Isabel, and the couple's chief of staff and fortune-teller, Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, Antonio was a prominent adviser and financier of the exiled populist leader. However, in the 1970s Antonio was displaced by L√≥pez Rega, and when Per√≥n returned to his country and was re-elected to the Presidency in 1973, Antonio opted to stay in Madrid. Except for a short stay in July 1974, on the occasion of the death of his mentor, Antonio did not return to Argentina until 1977. He was also friend of Carlos Sa√∫l Menem, under whose presidency he once again became an influential man in the Argentinian business world. He had introduced Menem, also the son of Syrians, to Per√≥n in 1964, though Antonio later distanced himself from the colorful Menem, who abandoned much of the populist Peronist platform during his presidency, in the 1990s.

The club was refounded a number of times, most recently in 2019, and played in all the Italian professional leagues from Serie A to Serie C2 in different times. Its recent renaissance in the early 2000s brought the rosanero back to Serie A and later on to gain a spot in the UEFA Cup for the first time in the club history, thus giving the club a worldwide popularity. The club currently plays in Serie B, Italy's second-tier football league. They won UEFA Cup qualification for three consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2007. Foundation and early years (1898‚Äì1927) Ancient Palermo FBC logo Historical first Anglo-Palermitan Athletic & Football Club lineup, year 1900 Lipton Cup winning side of 1910. The club, in common with several other Italian teams, has its earliest roots in England. Football was originally brought to Palermo by English sailors of cargo vessels in the late 19th century who would play football at the muddy port in their spare time. There is some debate about the exact date the club was founded. Some authorities think it may have been as early as 1898 due to the existence of papers addressed to Joseph Whitaker, English consul in Palermo and originally believed to be first club president, about a Palermitan football team founded in the month of April of that year. Actually, there is a probable misinterpretation of some sources: in April 1897, in fact, the future founders of Palemo Calcio create the association Sport Club. The most common and officially stated foundation date is 1 November 1900, as the Anglo Palermitan Athletic and Football Club. The club is thought to have been founded by Ignazio Majo Pagano, a young Palermitan colleague of Whitaker who had discovered football while at college in London, England, where the modern game of soccer originated from. The initial staff comprised 3 Englishmen and 9 natives of Palermo, with Whitaker as honorary chairman, Edward De Garston as inaugural president, and with red and blue as the original team colours. The first recorded football match, played by the team on 30 December 1900, ended in a 5‚Äì0 defeat to an unidentified amateur English team. The first official match, played on 18 April 1901 against Messina Football Club ended in a 3‚Äì2 win to the Palermitan side. The staff foundations of the Palermo football organization was composed of 3 Englishmen and 9 natives of Palermo, including: * Edward De Garston - President/Goalkeeper * George Blake - Player/Coach * Norman Olsen - Player * Benoit Marino - Player * Ignazio Majo Pagano - Player * Walter Gaffiero - Player * Natale De Stefani - Player * Matteo Macaluso - Player * Enrico Giaconia - Player * Roberto Pojero - Player * Vincenzo Pojero - Player * Felice Pirandello - Player The event was featured on November 1, 1900 in the frontpage of the Giornale di Sicilia. Joseph Whitaker and Conte Giuseppe Airoldi were also actively involved in supporting the club, with the former serving as honorary chairman. The first known football match, played by the team on December 30, 1900, ended in a 5‚Äì0 defeat to an unidentified amateur English team. The foundation colours of the team were red and blue. The twelve players used to meet and train them on a football field located in Via Notarbartolo, of Whitaker's property. The first official match, played on April 18, 1901 against Messina Football Club ended in a 3‚Äì2 win to the Palermitan side. From 1905 onwards the two clubs competed in the Whitaker Challenge Cup, this was competed three times, Palermo won the competition once. In 1907, the club changed its name to Palermo Foot-Ball Club, and the team colours were changed to the current pink and black; some sources state that the club colours were changed due to an accident which happened when washing the old red and blue shirts, while others (including an official letter from the time) state that the colours are poetically intended to represent bitter and sweet. From 1908 until the final one in 1914, Palermo also played in the Lipton Challenge Cup, not to be confused with the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, also organized by English businessman Sir Thomas Lipton. The competition saw them face off against Naples; Palermo won the competition three times, including a 6‚Äì0 victory in 1912. Football activity in Palermo then halted until 1918 because of the World War I. On February 16, 1919 the club name was changed to U.S. Palermo, the club was refounded by a committee of young university students and sportsmen with barone Sergio as president, just after World War I. In 1920, Palermo competed in and won the Coppa Federale Siciliana. For the rest of the early 1920s the club competed in the Campionato Lega Sud reaching the semi-finals in 1924, before being knocked out when facing Audace Taranto, Alba Roma and Internaples. Early league prominence (1927‚Äì1943) With the ratification of the \\"Carta di Viareggio\\" of 1926, the \\"Prima Divisione 1926-1927\\", in which Palermo participated, became the prodromer of the current second level of the Italian football championship, being managed for the first time by the \\"Direttorio Divisioni Superiori\\" also for the South Italy: the Sicilians, however, played only nine football matches, because President Colombo had to withdraw the team due to financial problems, on December 10 of the same season. The first team of the city then became Vigor Palermo, that it was of the future Palermo' sport manager Tot√≤ Vilardo, who, after the championship of the \\"Seconda Divisione 1927-1928\\", became the third series, the equivalent today's Serie C, changed its name to Palermo Football Club and took on the rosanero colors, making a merger with the old company on July 15, 1928. President became Conte Liotta di Lemos. On August 15, the company is a point of a share capital of one hundred thousand lire, thanks to a subscription led by Vincenzo Florio. After three presidents in the short term of a year, the company began to be administered by Barone Bordonaro di Gebbiarossa, who resigned in 1931 to take up motor racing. The \\"barone\\" is responsible for the commissioning of a new coat of arms, made in the Futurist style by the Palermo painter Giuseppe \\"Pippo\\" Rizzo. The new Palermo was admitted on September 2 at the \\"Campionato Meridionale 1928-1929\\", which put a place in the new Serie B championship: the club placed third in the Sicilian sub-rig of group D, but was introduced in the next round for the FIGC resolution. Also in this phase the Palermo, arrived second, arrived made to pass from office. Arrived at the semi-finals, in the mini standings of group A, Palermo, together with Cagliari, Foggia and Lecce, played the first place for the final and, after having fought for a long time for that, came first on equal points with Lecce. It was therefore necessary to play a play-off for the final and to have the best were the Lecce players, set 1‚Äì0 in the neutral pitch of Naples. The promotion was then obtained the following year, thanks also to 15 goal striker Carlo Radice. Palermo then got off to a great start in Serie B, almost gaining promotion during its first season with a third-place finish, only three points behind Bari. The following season it gained promotion and the Serie B championship, with Radice scoring 27 of the 50 goals for Palermo. For its first season in Serie A, the club moved to a new stadium named Stadio Littorio (Lictorian Stadium) in the Favorita neighbourhood, today known as Stadio Renzo Barbera. The opening match was played there on January 24, 1932 against Atalanta, with Palermo winning 5‚Äì1. It took Palermo a couple of years to find its footing in the league, but by 1934‚Äì35 the club finished 7th, cementing its place as a well-established side. The next season however the club relegated to Serie B. Down in Serie B Palermo spent three consecutive seasons finishing in 7th position. Notably for Sicilian football, the league featured all three major regional teams, Palermo, Messina and Catania; it was also the first time Palermo played against Calcio Catania on a national scale; their rivalry would then become known as the Sicilian derby. Not considering the 1-0 Palermo win in a Reserve League match in 1929, the first official game between the two sides was played in Catania during the Coppa Italia 1935‚Äì36, and ended in a 1‚Äì0 win for the home side. The first derby in a domestic league was featured only a few months later, on November 1, 1936 at the Stadio Littorio and ended in a 1‚Äì1 tie, with Catania being supported by only eight people attending the match; Palermo got the better of Catania later in the season though, with a 1‚Äì0 victory. In 1936 the fascist regime forced Palermo to change its colours to yellow and red, after the official ones of the local municipality. Meanwhile, economical troubles arose: causing even the imposition of a 10 lire meat tax in an attempt to finance the club. However Palermo's fourth season for back down in the league was a troublesome one, as in 1940 it was expelled by the Italian Football Federation because of financial problems. A merger with Unione Sportiva Juventina Palermo brought to the foundation of Unione Sportiva Palermo-Juventina, which entered Serie C in 1941 and played with light blue colours. In 1942 the club returned to Serie B and switched back to its original colours. In 1943, however, chairman Beppe Agnello was forced to retire the club from the league following the World War II events. Post-War Palermo (1946‚Äì1970) Palermo goalscorer, Santiago Vernazza. After having won the war Sicilian championship, the Palermo, as a Serie B company, was invited to play in the south-central round of the \\"Divisione Nazionale 1945-1946\\", the first and last non-single group championship since 1929. In the meantime each reference to Juventina had fallen and the denomination was once again Unione Sportiva Palermo. Re-admitted to the category of belonging, in the 1947‚Äì1948 season Palermo won the girone C of the Serie B championship and obtained the promotion: in that team they played players like the Czechoslovakian ƒåestm√≠r Vycp√°lek and the Italians Gaetano Conti, Carmelo Di Bella and Aurelio Pavesi De Marco. The president was Stefano La Motta, who at the beginning of the season, after taking office on 1 July 1947, had declared: \\"I will be President for a season, the time to bring Palermo back to Serie A\\". He was speaking and the helm of the society passed to Giuseppe Guzzardella, although the main financier was Prince Raimondo Lanza di Trabia, who a few years later became the president himself. Meanwhile, Palermo finished 11th the following season in Serie A, thanks to several good performances, such as a vamp of two goals against Grande Torino. The prince brought several valuable players to Palermo such as Helge Bron√©e or ≈û√ºkr√º G√ºlesin and emerging coaches such as Giuseppe Viani. In 1951-1952 the rosanero fought long for first place, but a final drop brought them back to 11th position. The rosanero stayed six consecutive seasons in the top flight and the relegation of 1953-1954 came only after the playoffs salvation against SPAL and Udinese. The relegation was followed by a phase of profound reorganization, which involved all levels: the season of political presidents was inaugurated with Mario Fasino. Among the many new players purchased, Enzo Benedetti also arrived, who will become the captain of the Palermo team from 1955, after his first landing in Sicily, to 1962. In the following years, Palermo became a team that alternated Serie A promotions with relegations in Serie B (Club Yo-yo). One of the symbol players of this period was the former River Plate striker Santiago Vernazza, a fans' idol thanks to 54 goals in 121 total games which also make him the third in the all-time scorer list of Palermo. In the summer of 1960, Palermo participated for the first time in international competitions: in June at its first and last Cup of the Alps, in July at the first of two Mitropa Cups. The Palermo at the time succeeded in enhancing several players destined for a good career, such as Tarcisio Burgnich or goalkeeper Roberto Anzolin who was then sold to Juventus F.C.. The good corporate relationship with the Turin club is also witnessed by the passages of other players such as Giuseppe Furino, Carlo Mattrel and Franco Causio. The peak under the sporting profile arrived in the 1961-62 Serie A, when the rosanero reached the 8th place, gaining prestigious results, such as a historic 2‚Äì4 away victory against Juve in Turin, on February 18, 1962. In the same year the first Sicilian derbies were played in the top flight with Catania. The following edition Palermo failed to repeat and relegated to Serie B. In those years there were Casimiro Vizzini president and Tot√≤ Vilardo sports manager: Vilardo, the company's all-round secretary, was nicknamed The football wizard. At the end of the 1962‚Äì1963 season Vilardo was disqualified for life for an illegal attempt: he asked to the referee Concetto Lo Bello the Bari's win on the last day of the Serie B championship, so that once the Apulian freshman was promoted would be bought the player Jos√© Ferdinando Puglia, healing the coffers of the rosanero company. In 1968, with the transformation of the football club into a joint-stock company, Palermo changed its name to Societ√† Sportiva Calcio Palermo and moreover, in that year, the team returned in Serie A in the 1967-68 Serie B, with the former player and coach Carmelo Di Bella. In December of the new season, Palermo took part in its second and last Mitropa Cup and, therefore, in its third and last participation in a European competition. The following international experience will be lived 37 years later, in 2005 (UEFA Cup). Mixed times (1970‚Äì2001) Renzo Barbera took over the club on May 4, 1970, becoming the new chairman; he would go on to be remembered as one of the greatest chairmen in the club's history. After 1973, Palermo played exclusively in Serie B for a long period time. Despite their lower league status, Palermo were still able to garner some success in the cup this period, reaching the Italian Cup final in 1974, against Bologna, Palermo lost on penalty shoot-outs after a 1‚Äì1 tie, with the Bologna goal, a penalty, scored during injury time in the second half. Their name was modified again to Societ√† Sportiva Calcio Palermo during 1977. The club's second Coppa Italia final, under coach Fernando Veneranda, was reached in 1979; the game was lost 2‚Äì1 to Juventus after extra time, with the equaliser goal for the opponents curiously scored again during injury time, as happened five years before. On March 7, 1980 Barbera sold the club to constructor Gaspare Gambino, following a five-points deduction imposed by the Football Federation due to a match fixing scandal which involved Palermo midfielder Guido Magherini, then disqualified for 3 years and a half. In 1984 Palermo relegated to Serie C1 for the first time in its history, but promptly returned to Serie B one year later. The 1985‚Äì86 season which ended in the summer was however the last for Palermo, as the club, after a struggling saving from relegation, was expelled by the federation because of financial problems. the summer of 1987, after a year without professional football in Palermo, the club was refounded, bearing the current name, and began to play down from Serie C2, which was promptly won. A return to Serie B occurred in 1991, but lasted only a year. Palermo won the Serie C1 championship in 1993: that season, the league featured numerous other Sicilian clubs including Messina, Catania, Giarre, Siracusa and Acireale, with the latter promoted to Serie B together with Palermo. The rosanero stayed back up in Serie B for four seasons, and in 1994 wrote a piece of history for themselves with a 1‚Äì0 away win against AC Milan in the Coppa Italia second round. In the 1990s, the 1995‚Äì1996 season was the highlight for Palermo, obtaining a seventh place after having fought hard for promotion, and even appearing in the quarter- finals of the Coppa Italia after eliminating Parma and Vicenza among others, with a team mostly composed of Palermitan footballers and coached by Palermo- born Ignazio Arcoleo. However, the following season ended with relegation to Serie C1. In 1997 Palermo played one of the worst season in its history, as they were due to be relegated to the Serie C2 division after a dramatic and shocking defeat in a play-off against Battipagliese; however Palermo was later saved by the federation due to the expulsion of Ischia Isolaverde, another Serie C1 team. AS Roma chairman Franco Sensi bought the team on March 3, 2000, but the Palermo, in 1999‚Äì2000, missed a spot in the promotion playoffs. However, Palermo won group B of Serie C1 2000-2001 and got promoted to Serie B the next year, after a hard fight against fellow islanders Messina, reached at the top of the table just at the last match-day. Back in Serie A (2001‚Äì2005) In the summer of 2002, after a quiet Serie B season ended in mid-table place, Palermo was sold by Sensi to retail trade entrepreneur Maurizio Zamparini in a 15 million euro bid. The former Venezia owner brought in various players, including several ones from his past club, such as Mario Santana, Kewullay Conteh, Stefano Morrone and Arturo Di Napoli. The 2002‚Äì03 season was the first of the Zamparini era: the club went through two managers that season, Ezio Glerean and Daniele Arrigoni, the former being fired only after the first league matchday, a 4‚Äì2 loss to Ancona, before arriving at Nedo Sonetti, who managed to help Palermo climb the league table. However, Palermo missed out on promotion to Serie A on the final day of the season, after a 3‚Äì0 away defeat to Lecce, who obtained the last promotion place. Palermo ended in fifth place, and Sonetti was replaced by Empoli coach Silvio Baldini for the upcoming 2003‚Äì04 campaign. Zamparini was ambitious and reinforced the team with top signings such as Luca Toni, Lamberto Zauli and Eugenio Corini, and promising youngsters Simone Pepe, Andrea Gasbarroni and Christian Terlizzi. However, Baldini was fired in January 2004, after a shocking home defeat to Salernitana followed by public attacks from the head coach directed to the team chairman. Palermo, in third place at the time and reinforced still further with signings of Fabio Grosso, Antonio and Emanuele Filippini, replaced Baldini with Francesco Guidolin. The rosanero ended its season winning the Serie B title season on goal difference over Cagliari, with Luca Toni finishing the league top-scorer by some distance, with 30 goals in 45 matches. The 2004‚Äì05 season was the first back in Serie A for the Palermo club since 1973. The event was well welcomed by the team supporters, as the club managed to sell all the 33,000 home stadium seats reserved to local fans as season tickets. Palermo ended the season with an excellent sixth place, allowing it to qualify for the 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Cup for the first time in its history. Luca Toni broke the Palermo's Serie A scoring record by notching up 20 league goals. European years (2005‚Äì2013) After two successful seasons in Sicily, Francesco Guidolin resigned as coach and Luigi Delneri was appointed to replace him for the 2005‚Äì06 season, the first in a European competition in Palermo's history. During the summer football market, Luca Toni was sold to ACF Fiorentina for ‚Ç¨10 m and a couple of young internationals, Andrea Caracciolo and Stephen Ayodele Makinwa, were signed to replace him. The team had a good start in the new season, most notably with an exciting 3‚Äì2 win against Inter Milan and a successful UEFA Cup debut against Anorthosis Famagusta, defeated 6‚Äì1 on aggregate (2-1 and 4-0). Palermo successively won the group stage, finishing above RCD Espanyol, Lokomotiv Moscow, Maccabi Petah Tikva and Br√∏ndby IF. Despite good European form, Palermo was not able to keep up its form in the league; Delneri was consequently fired in January 2006 following a 2‚Äì1 home defeat to Siena and Giuseppe Papadopulo was appointed to replace him. He made his debut at the helm of Palermo with a sensational 3‚Äì0 win to AC Milan in the Coppa Italia quarter-final return leg, taking Palermo through to the semi-final round for the third time in its history; they eventually went out to AS Roma on away goals rule, the score being 2‚Äì2 on aggregate. Palermo was also eliminated from European by FC Schalke 04 in a 3-1 aggregate loss, after having defeated SK Slavia Praha in the round of 32. Palermo ended the season in eighth place, and thus was expected to play the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. However, due to the Serie A scandal of 2006, the FIGC stated they would not enter Palermo into the Intertoto Cup. In the meanwhile, Francesco Guidolin left AS Monaco to re-join Palermo at Papadopulo's place. After the verdicts penalized numerous clubs, Palermo's overall position for that season was elevated to fifth, meaning they had qualified for the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Cup. In the transfer window, Palermo spent millions adding players to their squad, including Aimo Diana, Mark Bresciano, F√°bio Simpl√≠cio and Amauri, but sold World Cup winner Fabio Grosso to Internazionale. The events led several football pundits to tip Palermo to do well in the season ahead. A very exciting start saw Palermo sitting on top of the Serie A table in September 2006 after beating Catania 5‚Äì3 at home in the Sicilian derby. Another notable victory was a 2‚Äì0 away win to AC Milan at San Siro stadium. The team started well also in the UEFA Cup by knocking out West Ham United. However, this time around the group stage proved to be more difficult than the previous year, and Palermo finished last in a group that contained Celta de Vigo, Eintracht Frankfurt, Fenerbah√ße SK and Newcastle United. On February 2, 2007 Palermo was involved in a controversial away Sicilian derby, suspended for 30 minutes during the second half and followed by violence outside the Catania stadium in which policeman Filippo Raciti was killed by a small explosive launched by a Catania hooligan. This was followed by a two-weeks stop to all football leagues and national team matches in the whole country. Successively to these events Palermo, then clearly third-placed, did not manage to achieve a single victory, and dropped down to sixth position in the Serie A. Club chairman Maurizio Zamparini became more critical of Guidolin and finally sacked him on April 23, 2007 following a 3‚Äì4 home defeat to third-last placed Parma which extended the run of poor results to 11 games without a single win. Assistant coach Renzo Gobbo and youth team coach Rosario Pergolizzi, appointed as caretaker coaches at Guidolin's place, led the team for two matches, a 2‚Äì1 away win at Livorno in their debut which ended the negative run and two further defeats, including an upset 3‚Äì2 away loss against last-placed team Ascoli, already relegated to Serie B at the time, which left the rosanero in seventh place, the last UEFA Cup spot, only three points above Atalanta. The events led Zamparini to revoke Guidolin's dismissal and call him back for the remaining two matches. Guidolin's return brought two victories, to Siena and Udinese, ending the season in fifth place, obtaining thus qualification to the UEFA Cup 2007-08 for the third consecutive time and breaking its previous record of 53 points of two years before. On May 31, 2007 Palermo chairman Maurizio Zamparini announced Stefano Colantuono as new rosanero coach for the 2007‚Äì08 season. The first two signings for the new season, midfielder Giulio Migliaccio from Atalanta and goalkeeper Samir Ujkani from Anderlecht, were announced on June 8. Contemporarily, team captain Eugenio Corini, whose contract was due to expire within a few days, announced he was going to leave Palermo. Palermo's moves in the summer market included notable signings such as Bo≈°ko Jankoviƒá and Fabrizio Miccoli to replace Andrea Caracciolo and David Di Michele, sold to Sampdoria and Torino respectively. A fairly unimpressive start in the season, including a shock UEFA Cup elimination against Czech minnows FK Mlada Boleslav, however convinced Zamparini to sack Colantuono after a crush 5‚Äì0 loss to Juventus, re-calling Guidolin at the helm of the rosanero. Guidolin's fourth spell as Palermo boss proved to be even more unsuccessful, as Palermo struggled in the league, falling down to thirteenth place with concerns of being unexpectedly involved in the relegation battle. A 3‚Äì2 home loss to Genoa, the third in a row for Palermo, followed by Guidolin's controversial attacks against the supporting fanbase and the club management, brought in to Colantuono being reinstated as rosanero boss on March 24, 2008. Colantuono was confirmed as Palermo boss for the 2008‚Äì09 season. During the summer transfer market, club stars like Amauri, Andrea Barzagli and Cristian Zaccardo were sold. New signings included former and current Italian internationals Marco Amelia, Fabio Liverani and Antonio Nocerino. The Rosanero started their season with a disappointing 2‚Äì1 home loss to Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Ravenna in the Third Round of the Coppa Italia. After just one game from the new campaign, a 3‚Äì1 loss to Udinese, Zamparini sacked Colantuono, and the head coach role was given to Davide Ballardini. With Ballardini as head coach, Palermo ended the season with a respectable eighth place, and also won its first Campionato Nazionale Primavera national title, under the guidance of youth coach Rosario Pergolizzi. After the end of the season, Palermo dismissed Ballardini from the coaching post following disagreements with the board, and replaced him with Walter Zenga, whose appointment from Sicilian arch-rivals Catania was greeted with surprise and dismay from supporters of both parties. Zenga's reign, however, lasted only 13 games, as he was dismissed on 23 November 2009 due to poor performances, ironically after a 1‚Äì1 home tie to Sicilian rivals and Zenga's former team, Catania, with former Lazio boss Delio Rossi being appointed at his place. Under the tutelage of Delio Rossi, results dramatically improved, and Palermo established a record of seven consecutive home wins, and also achieved prestigious results such as two 2‚Äì0 wins against Italian giants Milan and Juventus. The latter win, achieved on February, led Palermo to climb over the Bianconeri in fourth place, establishing the Rosanero as serious contenders for a Champions League spot, which they ultimately lost to Sampdoria by only one point. Such season also launched new emerging stars such as midfielder Javier Pastore and goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, who went on to become integral part of their respective international teams. Former club captain Fabrizio Miccoli The new season started with Delio Rossi still in charge of the club: Simon Kj√¶r and Edinson Cavani left the club, and a few more promising youngsters were signed (most notably Argentine Ezequiel Mu√±oz and the Slovene duo of Armin Baƒçinoviƒá and Josip Iliƒçiƒá), plus more experienced acquisitions such as forwards Massimo Maccarone and Mauricio Pinilla. The 2010‚Äì11 season also marked Palermo's return into continental football in the form of the UEFA Europa League. Palermo reached their third Coppa Italia finals after defeating Milan 4‚Äì3 on aggregate on 10 May 2011, losing 3‚Äì1 to Internazionale in the final. For the 2011‚Äì12 season, Delio Rossi was replaced by former Chievo boss Stefano Pioli, who was, however, sacked before the Serie A kickoff after being eliminated by Swiss minnows FC Thun in the Europa League third preliminary round. In a somewhat surprise move, Pioli was replaced by under-19 team coach Devis Mangia, with no managerial experience other than at youth team and minor league level; despite that, Mangia turned Palermo fortunes by leading the Rosanero in fifth place thanks to an impressive string of six consecutive home wins, thus deserving a long-term deal at the club. A string of poor results, however, led Palermo to three consecutive defeats, including elimination from the Coppa Italia and a disappointing loss in the Sicilian derby, persuading Zamparini to replace Mangia with the more experienced Bortolo Mutti. Palermo arrived 16th in that season. Zamparini's later years and Serie B return (2013‚Äì2018) Giuseppe Iachini, formerly a Palermo midfielder in the 1990s, replaced Gattuso as head coach during the 2013‚Äì14 season and led the club to a Serie B champions title and broke the highest-Serie-B-point record. For the 2012‚Äì13 season, Zamparini came with another staff revolution, appointing Giorgio Perinetti as the new director of football and Giuseppe Sannino as the manager, both coming from Siena. Significant sales included Federico Balzaretti and Giulio Migliaccio, who left the Rosanero as part of a complete restructuring. The season started in unfashionable manner, leading to the sacking of Sannino and his replacement with Gian Piero Gasperini; days later, Perinetti resigned and Pietro Lo Monaco was named as the new club managing director. Results did not improve, however, and Palermo descended into the relegation zone; a controversial handling of the January transfer window and even more negative results led to Gasparini being sacked for Alberto Malesani, and called back after three games, the return of Perinetti in place for Lo Monaco, and ultimately a second dismissal for Gasperini who was replaced by a re-hired Sannino. Despite a slight increase in results, Palermo ended its season in 18th place, being thus relegated to Serie B after nine consecutive seasons in the top flight. For the new Serie B campaign, Zamparini appointed former Milan and Italy international star Gennaro Gattuso as the new manager, despite him having little prior managerial experience; he was sacked in September 2013, the 28th sacked manager in 11 years. Fortune was reversed rather rapidly, however, as Palermo regained promotion back to Serie A for the 2014‚Äì15 season thanks to a 1‚Äì0 victory over Novara on 3 May 2014 under the guidance of Giuseppe Iachini, who took the reins over after Gattuso was sacked due to poor results, with the Rosanero responding with a record-breaking Serie B season ended with 86 points, one more than previous record holders Juventus, Chievo and Sassuolo (all of them in the 22-team Serie B format). Due to his successful results, Palermo confirmed Iachini as head coach for the 2014‚Äì15 Serie A season, and agreed a contract extension until June 2016 with him. A new director of football, Franco Ceravolo (formerly a scout for Juventus), was instead named in place of Perinetti, but was removed (with Iachini being instead confirmed) after a dismal season start led Zamparini to intervene in order to turn the team's fortunes. The non-playing staff changes at Palermo turned out to be ultimately successful, with Palermo winning many games afterwards and entering the fight for a UEFA Europa League spot thanks to the all-Argentine striking force of Paulo Dybala and Franco V√°zquez. In 2015‚Äì16 season, Palermo started their season without Dybala after the youngster moved to Juventus; the Rosanero therefore relied on senior striker Alberto Gilardino to play as a partner of V√°zquez. On 10 November 2015, coach Giuseppe Iachini was sacked due to disappointing results in the beginning of the season; he was replaced by Davide Ballardini.Palermo: Iachini out, Ballardini in Ballardini only lasted for 7 matches with Palermo before fired by Zamparini after spectacularly falling out with Palermo's players.http://www.football- italia.net/78706/official-palermo-ballardini-termination Palermo captain Stefano Sorrentino reported that during 1‚Äì0 victory against Hellas Verona, the coach did not speak to Palermo players neither before nor after the match.http://www.football-italia.net/78171/sorrentino-war-ballardini Fabio Viviani became Palermo's caretaker manager in a 0‚Äì4 defeat against Genoa. Rosanero hired Guillermo Barros Schelotto as a new manager. Schelotto, however, did not have the necessary paperwork to be registered as Palermo coach, so his position was taken by Primavera youth team coach Giovanni Bosi during a 4‚Äì1 win over Udinese. Schelotto was registered as a team manager during that match.http://www.football-italia.net/78894/palermo-await- schelotto-clearance Giovanni Tedesco named as Palermo's sixth coach of the season while Schelotto is still waiting for the paperwork.http://www.football- italia.net/78954/tedesco-new-palermo-coach On 10 February 2016, following Schelotto's resignation after UEFA refusal to hand him a valid European coaching authorization, Palermo announced to have promoted Primavera youth coach Giovanni Bosi as new head coach, with Tedesco as his technical collaborator. Five days later, Bosi was sacked, and Iachini was re-appointed as manager.Palermo bring back Beppe Iachini in seventh managerial change On 10 March, Iachini was sacked once again, as Walter Novellino was appointed as his replacement.http://www.football-italia.net/81069/official-palermo-appoint- novellino Novellino was then sacked on 11 April.http://www.football- italia.net/82665/novellino-%E2%80%98palermo-have-sacked-me%E2%80%99 Davide Ballardini was rehired a day later for the ninth managerial change that season.http://www.football-italia.net/82713/zamp-ballardini-even-b On 15 May, Palermo escaped relegation on the last day of the league with the necessary win over Hellas Verona 3‚Äì2, securing 16th place. For the 2016‚Äì17 season, Zamparini re-appointed Rino Foschi as director of football; he however resigned after just a month in charge and was replaced by former Trapani director Daniele Faggiano. Most senior players such as Gilardino, Sorrentino, V√°zquez and Maresca were sold and mostly replaced with Alessandro Diamanti plus a number of young and quasi-unknown foreign players. Ballardini, who was originally confirmed as head coach, left his position after a draw at Inter Milan at the second matchday of the season and was replaced with Serie A newbie Roberto De Zerbi. De Zerbi's stint as Palermo head coach ended in dismal as he was sacked following Coppa Italia elimination at home against Serie B team Spezia, and after seven league losses in a row, with former club captain Eugenio Corini taking over. This was followed by Faggiano's resignations; his role was not filled as Zamparini announced his intention to operate in the January 2017 transfer market with the support of a number of consultants of his, mostly Gianni Di Marzio, football agent Davor ƒÜurkoviƒá and Dario ≈†imiƒá (who was successively officially announced as part of the club non-coaching staff). After two more defeats against relegation battle opponents Empoli and Sassuolo, no major signing in the first half of January and eight points deep into relegation zone, Zamparini however decided to change his mind by appointing Nicola Salerno as new director of football. On 27 February 2017, Zamparini stepped down as chairman of Palermo after 15 years in charge, announcing he had agreed in principle to sell his controlling stake to an unspecified Anglo-American fund, led by Italian-American Paul Baccaglini who was named new club president on 6 March. Palermo ended the season in 19th place, being relegated to Serie B. The takeover, originally scheduled to be finalized by 30 April 2017 and then delayed by 30 June, eventually collapsed after Zamparini, who in the meantime had appointed Bruno Tedino as new head coach for the 2017‚Äì18 Serie B campaign, rejected the final offer he received from Baccaglini. On 4 July 2017, Baccaglini resigned as Palermo chairmen, falling back into the hands of Zamparini, after the necessary funds were not in place. Palermo's campaign in the 2017‚Äì18 Serie B aimed to an immediate promotion to the top flight, with Bruno Tedino as head coach and Fabio Lupo as director of football. The Rosanero ended the first half of the season in first place; however, a streak of negative results and disagreements between Lupo and Zamparini led to the former's dismissal and replacement with Aladino Valoti. As results did not improve, Tedino was ultimately dismissed as well and replaced by Roberto Stellone, who however failed on winning promotion, ending the regular season in fourth place and eventually losing the playoff finals to Frosinone. The club also experienced a number of administrative issues which led to Zamparini appointing Giovanni Giammarva, an administrative expert from Palermo, as new president. New ownerships, financial issues and Serie B exclusion (2018‚Äì2019) For the 2018‚Äì19 Serie B season, Palermo found themselves forced to sell a number of players due to financial issues, with Antonino La Gumina sold to Empoli for a reported fee of ‚Ç¨9m and Igor Coronado to Sharjah FC for ‚Ç¨6m. With Tedino reappointed as head coach, Zamparini also decided to rehire Rino Foschi as director of football for a third time, and Giammarva resigning from his chairman post on 8 August 2018. On 26 September 2018, Tedino was sacked for a second time, and again replaced by Stellone. On 24 October 2018, Raffaello Follieri's attempt to buy the club from Zamparini's hands collapsed. On 22 November 2018, the club formally confirmed a takeover agreement between Zamparini and an undisclosed investor. On 1 December, Zamparini confirmed the sale of the club to an unnamed London company for the \\"symbolic\\" price of ‚Ç¨10 (¬£8.75). The takeover by Sport Capital Group Investments Ltd. was officially formalized on 29 December 2018, with English businessman Clive Richardson, head of the new group, being named as new club chairman. In January 2019, the parent company, Sport Capital Group Investments was acquired by a listed company of NEX Exchange: Sport Capital Group plc, for a nominal fee. Following a January 2019 transfer session with no signings at all and tensions within the board, on 4 February 2019 Clive Richardson (chairman) and John Treacy (director) left the club with immediate effect. On 14 February 2019, Sport Capital Group plc, the ultimate owner of the club, sold the parent company of the club, Palermo F.C. S.p.A., as well as the club itself and other subsidiaries, such as Mepal S.r.l., to a consortium that led by Daniela De Angeli and other managers of the club, for a nominal fee. De Angeli was also appointed as the club's managing director, while Rino Foschi became the club chairman on top of his position as the director of sport. It was also announced that they would found new investors for the club. On 3 May 2019, it was announced that Sporting Network S.r.l., controlled by travel business company Arkus Network, had purchased Palermo F.C. S.p.A. as well as its subsidiaries U.S. Citt√† di Palermo and Mepal S.r.l. On the same day Alessandro Albanese became the new chairman of the club, while Roberto Bergamo became the new CEO; Rino Foschi was also re-appointed as the director of sport. The new owner Sporting Network S.r.l. subscribed a ‚Ç¨5 million capital increase of the club. By the end of the 2018‚Äì19 Serie B, Palermo were originally the third-placed team with 63 points, but were placed at the bottom of the league table by the FIGC on 13 May, due to financial irregularities, relegating them to Serie C. According to the press release of FIGC, under the Zamparini's ownership, the club had sold Mepal S.r.l., an investment vehicle that owns the image rights of the club, to a Luxembourger company that controlled by Zamparini, and then the club leased back the image rights for a nominal fee. On 29 May 2019, Palermo partially won on appeal against their relegation to Serie C, being docked 20 points for financial irregularities, therefore remaining in Serie B. On 24 June 2019, Palermo was reported to have failed to correctly submit its application to participate in the 2019‚Äì20 Serie B season, by failing to provide a valid insurance policy for the new year; in case of the application being rejected, the club would be excluded from Italian football and be possibly replaced by a phoenix club which would be forced to restart from Serie D, with all of its players and staff members being released automatically. The club was formally excluded from Serie B on 12 July 2019. A new club (2019‚Äìpresent) On 23 July 2019, in compliance of Article 52 of N.O.I.F., Mayor of Palermo Leoluca Orlando confirmed six declarations of interests had been presented for a new phoenix club to be admitted in Serie D for the 2019‚Äì20 season. The next day, Orlando announced to have chosen \\"Hera Hora srl\\", owned by entrepreneurs Dario Mirri (Palermo native, and Renzo Barbera's nephew) and Sicilian-American Tony DiPiazza, as the new owners. The new club, renamed Societ√† Sportiva Dilettantistica Palermo, restarted with Rosario Pergolizzi (a former Palermo youth coach) as their first manager, and managed to keep Andrea Accardi from the previous Serie B campaign, as well as signing former Serie A and Palermo star Mario Santana. Palermo completed their Serie D campaign in first place, and was awarded promotion to Serie C by the Italian Football Federation after all the amateur leagues were stopped in March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. On 16 July 2020, the club changed its name to Palermo Football Club. References Bibliography  * Category:Palermo F.C. Palermo ","title":"History of Palermo F.C."},{"id":"11809896","text":"A starter home or starter house is a house that is usually the first which a person or family can afford to purchase, often using a combination of savings and mortgage financing. In the real estate industry the term commonly denotes small one- or two-bedroom houses, often older homes but sometimes low-cost new developments. The concept originated in the United States during the post- World War II era when entry-level home ownership was a preferred option for young families and regarded as part of the American Dream. The original concept of a newly built starter home outside of the city has changed due to both the end of low-cost land development and the changing preferences of successive generations in the United States. Since the end of the 20th century, more new homeowners are seeking different kinds of housing such as a condominium or older existing home. Changes in the 21st century In the United States, as real-estate market conditions continue to inflate and rise in major and medium cities where growth is fast, many starter homes are only affordable or available in metropolitan area outer suburbs. The American Dream of a new-build single-family home on a previously unused lot continues to move further out of urbanized areas to capture the lowest cost land. However as many areas in the nation experience urbanization in multiple clusters, states such as California experience diffused land economics where no low-cost land exists. This has caused many real estate developers to either develop many low-cost townhomes densely or large single-family homes at high sale prices. The latter is frequently chosen resulting in starter-homes continuing to favor people in upper income brackets as the majority of a metro area's suburbs approach build-out and the distance to work ratio approaches a maximum. Factors that influence developers include land prices, perceived value, market demand, city planning law, construction costs, and maintaining profit margins. For the buyer's end, changing financial requirements and mortgage interest rates as low as half a percentage point may affect large groups of income brackets to not be able to finance market-determined affordable housing in the long-term. Personal income for individuals and families have also not kept up with market inflation and cost of living to overcome this. While starter homes may be considered affordable based on income, the true cost of home ownership has historically not been reflected in actual financing. Efforts to increase availability In locations with a lack of affordable housing, such as New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, London, or Shanghai, it may be impossible for first-time home buyers to find starter houses close to the city center.In China, the Starter Home is a Non Starter, BusinessWeek, Jun. 8, 2006 To assist such home buyers, local authorities such as that in Santa Cruz, California, have re-zoned previously commercial areas for residential housing specifically to allow developers to build starter homes.Tiny one-bedrooms could be the new 'starter home' in Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Sentinel, Sep. 27, 2006 The Wall Street Journal tracks median home purchase prices of starter homes as part of its real estate index.Starter Home Index - November 13, 2006, The Wall Street Journal's Real Estate Journal (latest available data) Cities, whether suburban or the central core, have generally moved to a trend of master planned communities where large tracts of land are set aside for one complete build-out in order to maintain low costs to the developer and provide essential affordable and entry-level housing. Commercial and retail components are almost always included in these starter home communities. United Kingdom A starter home is in the United Kingdom a house sold at a 20% discount to first time buyers under 40.http://www.theplanner.co.uk/news/200000-starter-homes-promised-by-cameron Starter homes are a policy of the Conservative Government.

Altair Nantechnologies designs advanced lithium-ion energy systems and batteries. Company Overview Battery technology Altairnano's best-known product are their lithium-ion batteries, produced by Altair's Power and Energy division. The batteries have an anode made of a lithium titanate oxide formed into a spinel structure. The titanate replaces the graphite anodes of typical lithium ion batteries. The batteries are not the only batteries to use nanomaterials, but other batteries, like those from A123 Systems generally replace the cathode rather than the anode. The primary advantage of their batteries is that they can be charged very quickly. In testing, a 35 kW¬∑h battery pack was charged in ten minutes.autobloggreen.com, AeroVironment successfully quick charges Altair Nanotechnologies battery, May 30, 2007 Greater stability under electrical and mechanical stress (i.e. the cells cannot catch fire) Other advantages include longer life with up to 25,000 deep cycles, higher power density than other nanostructured cells, wider operating temperatures, and greater stability under electrical and mechanical stress (i.e. the cells cannot catch fire). On the other hand, a disadvantage is that they have lower specific energy than other lithium ion cells, 100 versus 120 Wh/kg.autobloggreen.com, Q&A;: AltairNano CEO Alan Gotcher, May 7. 2007 They have also been more expensive to produce, at US$2 per Wh, due to low manufacturing volumes. The chemistry imposes, on the battery industry, a new methodology for evaluating batteries. Traditionally batteries have been evaluated on a nominal dollars/Wh basis. The battery's increased life expectancy and depth of discharge (usable energy) add more scope to the formula changing it from a nominal valuation to a practical, or useful, evaluation. For example, a typical lithium ion battery might have about 160 Wh/kg where Altair's is about half of that, at 80 Wh/kg. However, to optimize the life of a typical lithium ion system it can only be run between about a 30% state of charge and an 80% state of charge, leaving about 80 Wh/kg of useful energy. Altair's system can be run optimally between 10% and 90% state of charge, leaving around 64 Wh/kg or only 20% less than a typical lithium ion. Taking into account Altairnano's increased life expectancy, operational temperature range, and power density the battery relates well to other energy storage technologies. Today Altairnano has three cell chemistries; An 11Ah energy cell, a 50Ah energy cell, and a new 3.5Ah power cell. The new 3.5Ah power cell has specific energy of 40wh/kg, specific power of 4 kW/kg, and a maximum charge rate of 50C. In transportation it can be used for light and heavy hybrid electric vehicles and large diesel starters, in electric grid ancillary services it can be used as a super capacitor alternative, and in the military it can be used for weapons pulse power, as an aircraft starter, and for communications. Altairnano will have a second generation 11Ah cell that will be available around the fall of 2009. The performance of this second generation cell will be different due to a new cathode. The nature of the new cathode is proprietary at this time. The performance will differ in that the specific power will decrease from 2200w/kg to 1000w/kg which is still more than twice the minimum PHEV requirement of 400w/kg. A presumed benefit to this chemistry will be that the observed cell voltage (OCV) vs the state of charge (SOC) will be a smooth curve. This simplifies challenges for battery control systems on electric vehicles and makes them easier to control. . Partnerships AltairNano shares its battery technology with battery electric vehicle manufacturers. Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, California is planning to use Altair's batteries in its sport-utility vehicles, currently slated to ship in 2010. The Lightning Car Company in the UK has a license for using their cells in its upcoming sports cars.Lightning Car Company, Technology: NanoSafe Proterra, a battery dominant hybrid, and battery- electric, drive solutions designer, developer and manufacturer, is using Altairnano batteries in its all-electric EcoRide BE35 vehicle, a lightweight 35-foot bus. In July 2007, AltairNano entered into a joint development and purchase agreement for a suite of energy storage products with AES Corporation, an electrical power distribution company. These are for three distinct market applications: # Frequency Regulation # Renewables Integration # Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications. As a first step Altairnano has produced for AES an independently tested, one megawatt, grid-scale, battery energy storage system currently in use in the PJM Interconnection Regional Transmission Organization control area in Norristown, PA. The agreement with AES is not exclusive leaving Altair free to negotiate with any other utility, Independent System Operator (ISO), merchant operator, municipality or rural electric cooperative. Altair Nanotechnologies also has relationships with the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) (MoD). The DOD relationships include providing a battery backup system to replace the otherwise continuously running diesel turbine generators on United States Navy vessels, such as the Arleigh Burke class destroyer, and United States Army batteries for the M119 howitzer. The U.K. MoD relationship is via BAE Systems Marine Limited for which Altair is producing a battery system for submarine power and propulsion. Altairnano has joined a number of other companies in a consortium called the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Batteries (NAATB). The objective of this alliance is to build a single production facility where member companies would be able to purchase line time to build their own battery cells while keeping safe their proprietary information. Altairnano is also a member of the Defense Advanced Battery Manufacturing Coalition (DABMC). Notwithstanding this partnership activity, as of March 2009, Altairnano has shipped little more than prototypes and relatively small numbers of battery packs.

His modus operandi included: nocturnal attacks; entry of the domicile while victim was asleep, strangulation with an electrical cord to the point of unconsciousness, followed by rape and sodomy. Identified via police sketches, Grettenberg, an aircraft refueler, was arrested at his apartment in the fall of 1977. In December, he was found guilty of three counts of aggravated sexual assault and two of burglary of a habitation. He was sentenced to 123 years in the Texas Department of Corrections but served only nine. Less than six months into his 1986 parole in Houston, Grettenberg attacked two teenage girls in separate incidents. Convicted of burglary and theft, a Harris county court this time sentenced Grettenberg to a term of life with no eligibility for parole for 20 years. In 1989, one of his Houston victims, a former teen beauty pageant contestant named Lisa Kilgore, filed a negligence suit against the Texas State Pardons and Parole Board for his 1986 early release. In September of the following year, in what is believed to be an unprecedented action, the Board admitted to error (but declined explanation) and settled out of court with Kilgore in the amount of $125,000.

The process uses the same technology as PCR, but takes advantage of DNA hybridization and annealing as well as DNA polymerase to amplify a complete sequence of DNA in a precise order based on the single stranded oligonucleotides used in the process. It thus allows for the production of synthetic genes and even entire synthetic genomes.  PCA principles  thumbnailMuch like how primers are designed such that there is a forward primer and a reverse primer capable of allowing DNA polymerase to fill the entire template sequence, PCA uses the same technology but with multiple oligonucleotides. While in PCR the customary size of oligonucleotides used is 18 base pairs, in PCA lengths of up to 50 are used to ensure uniqueness and correct hybridization. Each oligonucleotide is designed to be either part of the top or bottom strand of the target sequence. As well as the basic requirement of having to be able to tile the entire target sequence, these oligonucleotides must also have the usual properties of similar melting temperatures, hairpin free, and not too GC rich to avoid the same complications as PCR. During the polymerase cycles, the oligonucleotides anneal to complementary fragments and then are filled in by polymerase. Each cycle thus increases the length of various fragments randomly depending on which oligonucleotides find each other. It is critical that there is complementarity between all the fragments in some way or a final complete sequence will not be produced as polymerase requires a template to follow. After this initial construction phase, additional primers encompassing both ends are added to perform a regular PCR reaction, amplifying the target sequence away from all the shorter incomplete fragments. A gel purification can then be used to identify and isolate the complete sequence.  Typical reaction  A typical reaction consists of oligonucleotides ~50 base pairs long each overlapping by about 20 base pairs. The reaction with all the oligonucleotides is then carried out for ~30 cycles followed by an additional 23 cycles with the end primers.  Gibson assembly  A modification of this method, Gibson assembly, described by Gibson et al. allows for single-step isothermal assembly of DNA with up to several hundreds kb. By using T5 exonuclease to 'chew back' complementary ends, an overlap of about 40bp can be created. The reaction takes place at 50 ¬∞C, a temperature where the T5 exonuclease is unstable. After a short timestep it is degraded, the overlaps can anneal and be ligated. Cambridge University IGEM team made a video describing the process. Ligation independent cloning (LIC) is a new variant of the method for compiling several DNA pieces together and needing only exonuclease enzyme for the reaction. However, the method requires even number of DNA-pieces to be joined together and (usually PCR mediated) synthesis of suitable adapters. LIC cannot thus be regarded as a \\"non-scarring\\" sub-cloning method.

It is located at 50 Hudson Avenue between South Water Street and the Metro-North Hudson Line train tracks. An Italianate brick building, it and the Union Hotel across the street are the only two hotel buildings remaining from the period of Peekskill's industrial height as a center for the manufacture of stoves. It continued to be in use as a hotel after that industry declined, but couldn't survive the decline of the railroad in the mid-20th century. Vacant and neglected through most of the later years of that century, it was restored early in the next. In 2000 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Currently it houses a retail store on the ground floor, and the city's economic development offices. Building The building's small lot is flat, reflecting the nearby Hudson River. The fenced-off tracks are on its west; it shares a party wall with another commercial building to the east. To its north is a vacated section of the former West Street, the only fragment of Peekskill's once yellow-brick paved streets remaining in the city. The Standard House is a three-story painted brick building, four bays by three, with a shallow-pitched pyramidal roof covered in bitumen roll topped by a central cupola with a flagpole on top. Two brick chimneys rise from the western corners. The south (front) elevation of the first story has two glass storefronts, topped by a wooden cornice. All four windows on both upper stories are round-arched with louvered shutters, brick keystones and a stone sill supported by corbeled brick. \\"STANDARD HOUSE\\" is prominently painted on a wooden panel between the second and third stories. The roofline has a dentilled wooden box cornice, with molding and brackets above a paneled frieze. The cupola has roofing and trim similar to the rest of the building. Some past fire damage is still visible at its southwest corner. Inside, the first floor has been completely gutted and rebuilt. Only the original wood siding and window framing on the west wall remain. The two upper stories have their original plans intact as well as most of their original finishings. History Built in approximately 1855, it was originally used as a boarding house and tavern, catering to the busy traffic in the industrial area of the city near the New York Central railroad and the Hudson River.June 2001, \\"Cerretas Honored For Historic Preservation\\"; Half Moon Press; retrieved June 17, 2007 from hudsonriver.com. The name \\"Standard House\\" is not associated with the property until a photo taking during the Blizzard of 1888 shows the name on the facade between the second and third stories as it appears today. The origins of the name are unclear. Theories that have been advanced suggest a connection to William Jennings Bryan. The first concerns The Standard, a society newspaper published in New York and London during the 1890s. Issues with articles highlighting Bryan and Chauncey Depew, a Peekskill native, were found in the building during its restoration. At that time, the owner, John Galligan, was a staunch supporter of Bryan and bimetallism A local newspaper photo taken of Bryan campaigning from the railroad station during the 1908 presidential election shows the Standard House prominently in the background. A photo in the same newspaper of William Howard Taft speaking at the same spot two days later was taken from a different angle that does not show the building at all. Throughout the early 20th century, the Standard House passed through several other owners. At the outset of Prohibition, a man named John Carbone bought it and turned it into a successful restaurant, restoring liquor service after Prohibition's repeal. While the industry around Peekskill's waterfront declined, Carbone's remained successful, but the building was neglected by subsequent ownership, which renamed it the Central Grill. After suffering severe fire damage, the building was boarded up and left to deteriorate further while the city pursued a foreclosure action against its owners for unpaid property taxes. In 1998, the building was purchased by Kathy and Rick Cerreta, longtime city residents with an interest in historic preservation. They spent heavily on restoring the structure, rebuilding its wooden windows instead of merely replacing them. In 2000 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. They reopened it in March 2001, and shortly thereafter received an Excellence in Historic Preservation Award from the New York State Preservation League.New York State Preservation League; April 23, 2001; Excellence in Historic Preservation: 2001 Annual Awards; retrieved June 17, 2007. The city has also recognized them for the effort. They have been leasing the space inside to local businesses since then. In popular culture In 2001, the Standard House was used as a police station in the 2002 movie Unfaithful, however the filmmakers decided to change the ending of the movie, and the scene with \\"Standard House\\" was omitted. The building can still be seen in the \\"deleted scenes\\" section of the movie's DVD.

The battle was precipitated by the decision of the Synod of Erfurt to stop paying an annual tribute to the Magyars in 932. Prelude The Magyars (Hungarians), Eurasian nomads who had originally served as mercenaries under Emperor Arnulf, after his death in 899 began to campaign in the Kingdom of Italy and East Francia. In 906 they broke up Great Moravia and one year later destroyed a Bavarian army under Margrave Luitpold at the Battle of Pressburg. In 924 a Magyar army invading the German duchy of Saxony defeated King Henry I in the field, but an √Årp√°d prince‚Äîprobably Zolt√°n‚Äîcaptured near Pfalz Werla allowed Henry to negotiate for terms. A truce of nine years, during which annual tribute was required of the Germans, was declared in 926.Reuter, 143. During the truce, Henry reorganised the defences of his Saxonian duchy and subdued the Polabian Slavs in the east. At a 926 assembly, Henry secured the construction of new castles and the authorisation of a new form of garrison duty: the soldiery were organised into groups of nine agrarii milites (farmer-soldiers), one of which was doing guard duty at any given time while the other eight worked the fields. In time of invasion, all nine could man the castles. King Henry and the Hungarian envoys, 19th century depiction After he believed the necessary reforms had been made, Henry secured the support of the church in reneging on tribute payments in 932. Allegedly he had a dead dog thrown down in front of the Magyar negotiators, which amounted to a declaration of war. Battle In preparation for the campaign, Henry levied mounted contingents from every region and stem duchy of the German kingdom, though only French chronicler Flodoard of Reims records the Bavarian presence.Reuter, 142.Bernhardt, 16. The Thuringian contingent, though probably mounted, was described as inermes, or unarmed (though probably just poorly armed) by the contemporary chronicler Widukind of Corvey. His Saxon horsemen were described as armed warriors (miles armatus), but \\"he could not trust his horsemen, because they lacked certain skills and not enough of them were equipped as a miles armatus should be.\\"Leyser, 5-6. Leyser further notes that historians are unsure if these horsemen were free knights or unfree ministeriales. The Hungarian campaigns of 933 against the German Kingdom and the Battle of Merseburg. The Magyars had besieged an unknown town but attempted to withdraw in the night because Henry and his army had camped in the neighborhood at Riade. Henry sent forward a small contingent of footsoldiers with a few cavalrymen as a screen for his main army.Santosuosso, 149‚Äì50. The king had learned what to expect from the preceding struggles, where the rapidity of the Magyar light cavalry and archers had brought them success. He confronted their onset with light armoured combatants at first, followed by a massed heavy cavalry attack. According to Widukind of Corvey, the Magyar forces readily fled at the coming of Henry's horsemen and the victorious German troops declared Henry emperor on the battlefield. The exact location of the battle is unknown and several municipalities in Central Germany claim to be the site of the combat, among them Kalbsrieth, at the confluence of Unstrut and Helme, and the Hunnenfeld near Riethgen. However the place of Riade rendered by Widukind denotes the army camp of King Henry, probably not identical with the battlefield. Aftermath In Henry's lifetime the Magyars did not dare to make a further raid on East Francia. In 954 they again invaded Germany during a rebellion instigated by Duke Liudolf of Swabia and were finally defeated by Henry's son and successor King Otto I at the Battle of Lechfeld.

Erfurt was attended by ecclesiastics from every region of the Kingdom of Germany save the Duchy of Bavaria, where Duke Arnulf presided over the Synod of Dingolfing, probably in concert with Henry's simultaneous Erfurt event. The purpose of the synod was to deal with everyday church matters, but it did discuss one pressing issue, that of the annual tribute owed to the Magyars during a nine-year truce (beginning 926). The synod agreed to cease paying the tribute and the Battle of Riade precipitated. Among the other issues the synod considered was that brought forward by Pietro Candiano II, Doge of Venice, who suggested in a letter to the council that all Jews who refused to be baptised be expelled from the kingdom. The canons of the council were published as a breviarium canonum and sent to Adalbert, Archbishop of Salzburg. Sources *Kedar, B.

It was created on 5 May 1620 for Richard Berney, Sheriff of Norfolk in 1622. Family history The Berney (Barney) name comes from that place which is in the hundred of North Greenhow, Norfolk, and is recorded as Berlej in the Domesday Book.. The family can be traced back to Sir Thomas de Berney, who in the reign of Edward III, acquired the manor of Reedham through his marriage with Margaret, daughter and heir of William de Reedham. His descendant Henry Berney (died 1584) moved the family seat from near Reedham Church, and built Reedham Hall within a park. It was also known as Park Hall. It was sold in 1696 and gutted in a fire in 1750. Henry's eldest son, Sir Richard Berney, was Sheriff of Norfolk in 1610. He married Juliana, daughter of judge Sir Thomas Gawdy of Redenhall. Their son Sir Richard Berney, 1st Baronet (died 1668) was created a baronet in 1620. Another son Thomas Berney was High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1647 and the ancestor of the Berneys of Morton Hall in Broadland, Norfolk. The first Baronet married Anne Smallpage of Chichester. He left all his estates in Reedham not to his eldest son and heir, the second Baronet, but to his second son, Richard. The sixth Baronet was Sheriff of Norwich in 1762. The 7th Baronet, Sir John Berney, married Lady Henrietta Neville, daughter of George Neville, 1st Earl of Abergavenny in 1779. The 8th Baronet, Sir Hanson Berney, oversaw the renovation and extension of Barton Bendish Hall, the family seat. Designed by James & Turner of Norwich, the existing east wing was renovated and the south-west double wing was added in 1865. Sir Hanson also established the village pub known today as The Berney Arms. Sir Henry Hanson Berney, 9th Baronet, married Jane Dorothy Bloxam, daughter of the Rev. Andrew Bloxam. Sir Henry died in 1907, and the baronetcy passed to his grandson, Sir Thomas Reedham Berney, 10th Baronet, son of Captain Thomas Hugh Berney, 2nd West Yorkshires, who died in the Second Boer War.

In 1991 Heidi John and Richard John started a series of warehouse, rave parties. In 1993 they formed the Melbourne Underground Development (M.U.D.) crew with Phil Woodman (aka Phil Voodoo, Deja Voodoo). From 1993 to 1997 the parties were held at the Global Village in suburban, Footscray. Some 21 such parties were held until the year 2000. A one-off Every Picture Tells a Story event was held in April 2010.  Every Picture and other M.U.D. events  In 1991 Heidi John and Richard John organised a set of rave parties as all-night electronic dance music festivals, Every Picture Tells a Story. In the 1980s they had attended warehouse parties in the United Kingdom, which were run by local crews before they ran their own parties in London's East End with Joe Wieczorek of Club Labyrinth. The Johns created a similar collective, Melbourne Underground Development (M.U.D.), with Phil Woodman (aka Phil Voodoo, Deja Voodoo), and local DJs (Will E Tell, Richie Rich, HMC) who each performed for several hours. Paul Fleckney, in his book Techno Shuffle (2015), praised how \\"During the 90s, the Johns keep the underground flame burning with jungle and breakbeat DJs.\\" Aside from live electronic musicians and DJs, the festivals featured computer animation, performance artists and visual art. From 1993, the parties were held at the Global Village warehouse complex in Footscray, and later also at TVU Warehouse Footscray, West Gates Sports Complex Altona, Epicentre (Byron Bay, New South Wales), and the Bertie St Warehouse, Port Melbourne. Each festival used a collective of artists (such as the Mutoid Waste Company) and DJs who together formed the local underground techno movement. Some of the TVU Warehouse performances were screened live-to-air. M.U.D.'s Woodman organised the May 2000 event, \\"Everyone comes in, they live here for a week, they all draw banners... They all work together, they all connect, they are in one mindframe. That's what started this party.\\" Woodman, as Deja Voodoo, is a mixed-media artist; an exhibition of his artwork was held in June 2013. M.U.D. also put on other events such as the Pleazure and Strange parties, each had their own themes, d√©cor, installation art, video graphics and vibe with music performed by dozens of Australian and international live acts and DJs. The final Every Picture Tells a Story party (number 21) was held on 4 November 2000 at Festival Hall, Melbourne. Appearing at festivals were international acts, including Luke Slater, Claude Young, Derrick May, Stacey Pullen, Ultra Sonic. The visual aesthetic for Every Picture Tells a Story events made a cultural impact in Melbourne. Christine Siokou described the local rave party scene of 1998 to 1999, she noted that Every Picture Tells a Story \\"parties aim for an all-ages crowd\\" and that their \\"capacity crowds\\" show that \\"the thousands of young people attending raves associate, to varying degrees, with a raver identity\\". In 2010 Every Picture Tells a Story returned for a one-off performance, Frequency Shift. After the devastating bush fires in Victoria in February 2009, community spirit needed to be lifted and a space was offered to M.U.D. to stage a special 3-day gathering in the Yarra Valley. The event was due on 16 to 18 April 2010, but was cancelled due to council restrictions. A warehouse day-night event took place instead on 17 April 2010 at the Melbourne Docklands, shed 4.  Global Village  Global Village was a warehouse complex in an industrial area of Footscray, named by Richard John of M.U.D. Once the Docklands Cotton Mill, the huge warehouse space was lying unused and was discovered by Woodman in 1993; he recognised its potential as an arts and events space. Global Village was first used as a rave venue on New Year's Eve 1993-1994 when it hosted the seventh Every Picture Tells a Story party. Global Village was the first of its kind in Australia, and possibly the world - a local council approved venue that allowed for total freedom to create any style of event without noise restrictions or hours of operation. It hosted a range of events, from a Melbourne Fashion Festival show, art exhibitions (such as Mind a Maze) and dance parties. Over sixty events were held, and the final, Shut-Down, party was held on 22 February 1997. The afternoon of the party, the building's owners attempted to stop it taking place by locking the organisers out and putting security guards in place. M.U.D. moved the sound system into the outside courtyard and with hundreds of guests beginning to queue, the local police were called by the owner's to assist in shutting the event down. However, due to its popularity and the size of the crowd, and the fact that no problems had ever arisen at previous events, the police allowed the party to go ahead fearing a riot may take place if they intervened. Woodman described Global Village as \\"artistic hub of like- minded people that came to dance, laugh, and express themselves in a safe, inspirational environment that was unique to the 90's.\\"  Responses  \\"Artists came out of the woodwork,\\" visual artist, Garry Shepherd, told the ABC's Sounds Like Techno online documentary in 2002. \\"Where else do you get to play with a ready-made crowd and a huge sound system and lasers at your disposal?\\" In the same documentary, fellow artist Robin Cooke agreed: \\"These events were so big, eight to nine thousand people. This was too big for one or two artists to handle; it needed 20 artists to make the thing come together.\\" Melbourne journalist and former editor of Zebra (dance music insert) in Inpress magazine, Andrez Bergen (aka Little Nobody), described the venue: \\"Global Village was one of the most important semi-institutions in Melbourne in the mid '90s especially. The crew behind Global Village, namely M.U.D., were very supportive of the more cutting edge live acts, for example Voiteck, Zen Paradox, Soulenoid, Guyver III, Sense and TR-Storm ‚Äì who were then known as Void ‚Äì and it gave these guys the opportunity to play before large and often more-into-it or dare I say 'enlightened' audiences. It also gave audiences the opportunity to see these guys because at more mainstream parties or clubs more mainstream music was played.\\" \\"The first thing I noticed upon arrival was the queue. Immense,\\" wrote Lindy Tan in a review of Every Picture Tells a Story: Equinox in March 1998 for Tranzfusion website. She continued, \\"It's true that Every Picture parties always seem to attract quite a younger crowd, but ‚Äì as per usual ‚Äì there was stunning decor, a great venue, and great local acts.\\"Every Picture Tells a Story: Equinox, Lindy Tan. , 21 March 1998.

Little is known about his life, and the few details once thought secure are contested. He may have been from Cilavegna, a town near Pavia, judging by his name, and he likely spent a large portion of his career in Casale Monferrato, a town in northwestern Italy. He may have been maestro di cappella at the cathedral there, or perhaps held a similar post at S Maria di Piazza.Fenlon, Grove online The cathedral in Casale Monferrato possesses several important manuscripts which contain the surviving work by Cellavenia. One of the manuscripts, Casale Monferrato, Duomo, Archivio Capitolare, D (F), includes seven compositions by Cellavenia out of a total of sixty-six compositions, mostly motets (other composers with works in the collection include Jean Mouton, Jean Richafort, Jacquet of Mantua, Crist√≥bal de Morales, and others). Another manuscript, I-CMac (N)(H), has four motets by Cellavenia. Both were copied in the period from 1538 to 1545.Hamm/Call, Grove online Cellavenia's music shows a mixture of Italian elements and stylistic traits of the Franco-Flemish composers from the north. Many of his motets are based on pre-existing material: canti firmi are drawn from composers such as Richafort and Andreas da Silva, composers who are, not surprisingly, represented in the same manuscripts which contain his work ‚Äì he was familiar with their music from his work at the cathedral. Others of his motets are based on Gregorian chants. His complete works, edited by David Crawford, are in volume 80 of Corpus mensurabilis musicae (1978).

Lingo discusses the pursuit of what was considered a \\"Greek\\" manner in the Roman circle of Duquesnoy, which included Boselli. was the antithesis to Gian Lorenzo Bernini's. Boselli was a member of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca in Rome, in which he served as its Principe for the year 1667 until his death on September 23. Boselli's Osservationi della Scoltura antica Theories of proportions as exhibited in sculpture and dialogues on the relative merits of painting and sculpture were common enough in Renaissance and Baroque Italy, but they remained theoretical and rarely descended to the artisanal level. The treatise by Pomponius Gauricus, De sculptura offers a passage on bronze-casting by the lost-wax method. The Proemio of Giorgio Vasari's Le Vite de' pi√π eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori presents some workshop information on the practices of the architect, the sculptor and the painter. Only two sculptors have left extensive written material detailing the practice of their art. One, well known, is Benvenuto Cellini's Trattato dell'Oreficeria e della Scultura, 1568. The other, not published until 1939 and known only to art historians, is Orfeo Boselli's manuscript Osservationi della Scoltura antica written in the 1650s. It is conserved in the Corsini library in Rome.It was analyzed in Phoebe Dent Weil, \\"Contributions toward a History of Sculpture Techniques: 1. Orfeo Boselli on the Restoration of Antique Sculpture,\\" Studies in Conservation 12.3 (August1967), pp. 81-101; Ms Weil published the full text at Florence, 1978.

Galway (December 3, 1922 ‚Äì June 29, 1998), was an American meteorologist pioneering in the fields of severe convective storm forecasting and research. He was one of the first forecasters for the Severe Local Storms Unit (SELS) and the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC), and developed widely used synoptic (as well as mesoscale) predictors associated with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, such as the jet streak and lifted index.  Biography  Joseph G. Galway was born on December 3, 1922 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His parents encouraged him to get a college education and he attended Boston College. Galway majored in mathematics and economics. He enrolled in the Army in the fall of 1940, with war imminent, and received a compressed formation in just 28 months in December 1942, preceding duty in the US Army Air Service. There, Galway was sent to Brown University for a 26-week premeteorology program then entered the 9-month cadet meteorology program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on October 4, 1943. Galway graduated from June 5, 1944 and was sent as an air traffic controller in the Pacific theater where he kept notes with which he wrote Across the Pacific in 1947 but did not published. After discharge from the air force in 1946, Galway returned to Boston College and completed his bachelor degree in economics in 1947 before enrolling at Babson Institute of Business Administration in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Galway went back to MIT afterward to take a refresher courses in meteorology in 1949 while applying for work as a Weather Bureau forecaster. In 1950, he worked at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution but by December 1950, he was offered a job at Jacksonville, Florida by the Bureau and reported there on February 1, 1951. In the spring of 1952, U.S. Weather Bureau (USWB) Chief Francis Reichelderfer formed a special unit on severe storms forecasting following the sucecss of the first successful forecast of a tornado at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City on 25 March 1948. Joseph Galway was the first bureau forecaster to accept assignment to this unit that became known as severe local storms unit (SELS). The group of five forecasters was trained by members of the Weather Bureau and Army Navy Analysis Unit on forecasting rules. The SELS forecasters worked on shift to issue bulletins and warnings but were also encouraged to spend time on research projects during low convection seasons. Galway‚Äôs research began in the mid-1950s and continued until his retirement in 1984. He was a forecaster from 1952 to 1965 and from 1972 to 1984 with a break to be the Deputy Director of the center, by then named National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC). Some of his early contributions were: the lifted index, and the relationship between the upper-level jet and tornadoes. Besides his contributions to meteorology, Galway has written on the history of severe weather forecasting in the United States. Joseph G. Galway passed away in Kansas City, Missouri on June 29, 1998.  Bibliography    *  References   External links  * Some thoughts honoring the memory of Joseph G.

As with several previous changes of dynasty in China, this was a protracted and painful period of civil war. Though the start date of Qing rule is customarily given as 1644, when the last Ming Emperor hanged himself as the capital fell, the war had really begun in 1618 and Ming resistance continued until 1683. During this period, the Ming system of large-scale manufacturing in the Imperial porcelain factories, with orders and payments coming mainly from the imperial court, finally collapsed, and the officials in charge had to turn themselves from obedient civil servants into businessmen, seeking private customers, including foreign trading companies from Europe, Japanese merchants, and new domestic customers.Wirgin These new customers led to major changes in the style of porcelain, most of it painted in underglaze cobalt blue on white. A much more free approach was taken to painting, influenced by other Chinese genres of painting. Woodblock illustrations to books were often used as sources for images, or their style copied. An exhibition of porcelain from the period was called \\"The Liberated Brush\\".Wirgin This situation lasted from 1620‚Äì1683, when the new Qing dynasty, after some decades struggling with Ming forces, finally resumed large-scale use of Jingdezhen for official wares under the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662‚Äì1722). The larger kilns and a major part of the town were destroyed in 1674 by Ming forces after the Revolt of the Three Feudatories had become a civil war.Kerr, 16 From 1680 to 1688 the reconstruction of the industry was under the control of Zang Yingxuan from the Qing Board of Works. Organised production of court porcelain had resumed by 1683, and the institution of forced labour replaced by waged employment. Succeeding controllers were appointed by the provincial administration up until 1726, when Beijing appointed Nian Xiyao.Kerr, 18‚Äì19 History The start of the period is conventionally taken as being 1620, under the late Ming Dynasty, with the death of the Wanli Emperor (1573-1620), although the most characteristic style probably began from about 1628.Valenstein, 199-200 During the Wanli reign ceramics under government sponsorship slowly degenerated in quality until production itself was abandoned. The Manchu Qing dynasty regime took the capital in 1644. For those many intervening years, and for years after, a variety of porcelain wares were created in private kilns for domestic use and export to client markets such as Japan. Prior to the reinstatement of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen the private use of the dynastic reign name on ceramics was officially forbidden in the 16th year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing Dynasty (around 1677). Style The term \\"transitional\\" is usually and most correctly used for one characteristic style made in the period 1620-83, and arguably for some time afterwards. Other styles of porcelain continued to be made, including rather uninspired continuations of Ming styles. The true transitional style is finely potted and painted, with a deep blue compared to \\"violets in milk\\". Many pieces have groups of figures in an extravagant landscape with mountains, clouds, and the moon. Although very much in the \\"Chinese taste\\", the pieces also appealed to buyers from Japan and Europe, and many were immediately exported. Other types of wares were made in the Japanese taste, such as the shonsui wares and the ko sometsuke (Âè§Êüì‰ªò„Åë) or \\"old blue-and white\\" (the same term is used for Japanese-made versions of the style).Valenstein, 199-200 The term Tianqi porcelain is mostly used of these types for the Japanese market, from the Tianqi Emperor (r. 1620-27). The transitional ware of the early Kangxi decades witnessed a move away from designs and aesthetic standards of the painter Dong Qichang to newer tastes typified by the artist Shen Shitong and his use of western perspective. The influence of the artist Dong Qichang can be readily seen on ceramic ware of the period with its heavily accented light and dark tones. The change to Shen Shitung can be seen in generous vertical washes that create a definite foreground and background contrast. The informality of design and shape appealed to Japanese taste and especially those involved in the tea ceremony. Palace-ware or imperial-ware has traditionally found many admirers in Europe and America. Kangxi reign marks on porcelain are few throughout the ceramic period, but a few can be identified with the pre1677 decades. Earlier Ming period marks can frequently be found. Their styles closely match the few Kangxi marks that are found and aid in delineating Kangxi transitional porcelain.Masahiko Sato (Hanakoka and Barberri trans.), Chinese Ceramics, New York and Tokyo, 1981, pp. 206‚Äì209.

Riding on a wave of popularity for his handling of the crisis, Giuliani became a household name throughout the world. With plenty of media coverage and high public approval ratings, he became a major candidate to win the Republican nomination for the 2008 presidential race. She made national headlines in May 2004, when during a televised public hearing on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, she interrupted Giuliani while he was giving a speech. She has made appearances on various news-related programs on such networks as CNN and C-SPAN.Kyra Phillips, CNN Anchor (March 10, 2002) Interview with Christine Papasso, Sally Regenhard, Richard Saracelli\\".

Post 9/11 Regenhard has voiced her opposition to the construction of the controversial Park51 project that will be located in a building near Ground Zero. The proposed Park51 (named after the building's street address of 51 Park Place) project, which will include both a mosque and an Islamic cultural center, has been the target of many opponents who claim that it may attract Islamic extremists and who consider it an insult to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Regenhard, who was interviewed by the New York Times claims that the construction of the center would be \\"sacrilege on sacred ground.\\" In response to accusations that opponents to the project were anti- Muslim, Regenhard replied \\"People are being accused of being anti-Muslim and racist, but this is simply a matter of sensitivity.

O'Donnell won the championship in 1964 at the age of 27.Southerden, op. cit. p 11 At the time, surfing was dominated by men, and her championship was regarded as a step forward for women's recognition in the sport.Southerden, op. cit. p 12 O'Donnell also won the women's division of the Australian National Titles in 1963, 1964, and 1965.Warshaw, op. cit p 29 It has been widely reported that O'Donnell began longboard surfing in 1960 when she moved to Tweed Heads, New South Wales with her parents. In fact, her older sister had a boyfriend who surfed and had left his board at their home in Drummoyne, New South Wales when O'Donnell was in her late teens. Already keen bodysurfers at Manly Beach, the two young women took the board to Harbord. O'Donnell concentrated on paddling before taking to her feet. Her teacher was Snowy McAlister, the first inductee in the Australian Surfing Hall of Fame, and remained her mentor and friend until his death in 1987. By the age of 23, she was a seasoned rider and fell in love with Kirra, Queensland. O'Donnell finished 6th in the World titles in California (1966), 3rd in Puerto Rico (1968), 3rd in Hawaii's Makaha International (1966); 3rd twice and 4th once in the Australian titles (1966, '70, and '71); and 2nd place at Bells Beach, Victoria (1969), riding short boards from 1968 onwards. In the late 1960s, O'Donnell worked for Dewey Weber, a surfboard manufacturer in California. Returning home to compete, she won the last of her 8 Queensland surfing titles. She retired from competition in 1974, and two years later was inducted into the Australian Surfing Hall of Fame. In 2014, she was inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California.

French translation by Jean de Vignay, Bruges, c. 1478‚Äì1480, for Edward IV;British Library The medieval genre of speculum literature, popular from the twelfth through the sixteenth centuries, was inspired by the urge to encompass encyclopedic knowledge within a single work.Bradley, Ritamary \\"Backgrounds of the Title Speculum in Mediaeval Literature\\" Speculum 29.1 (January 1954), pp. 100‚Äì115. However, some of these works have a restricted scope and function as instructional manuals. In this sense encyclopedias and speculum are similar but they are not the same genre. Some have suggested that the modern equivalent is a summary survey, in the sense of a survey article in a scholarly journal that summarizes a field of research. Specula as a genre Specula often offered mirrors of history, doctrine, or morals. Vincent of Beauvais' Speculum Maius which included the Mirror of Nature, Mirror of History, and Mirror of Doctrine is not often described as a core representative of the genre. One historian has surmised that this is because Vincent's work was intended to be an objective work which is at odds with speculum literature, since it \\"is a subjective genre\\". More usual members are found in this list: * Honorius Augustodunensis' Imago mundi (cited by Vincent of Beauvais as Speculum mundi) and Speculum Ecclesiae (different than the Speculum Ecclesiae by Edmund Rich) * An anonymous Speculum virginum * William of Saint-Thierry's Speculum fidei * Nigel of Longchamps's Speculum stultorum * Speculum virginum Specific works whose titles include the word speculum * Speculum alchimiae, the \\"Mirror of Alchemy\\", written by Roger Bacon. * Speculum astronomiae, written by Albertus Magnus. * Speculum ecclesiae, the \\"Mirror of the Church\\", written by Edmund Rich. *Speculum Humanae Salvationis, the \\"Mirror of human salvation\\", written c. 1309‚Äì24, perhaps by Ludolph of Saxony. * Speculum judiciale, or Speculum iuris, the \\"Mirror for Judges\\", written by Guillaume Durand. * Speculum meditantis, the \\"Mirror of Meditations\\" (usually known by its French title Mirour de l'Omme), written by John Gower. * Speculum perfectionis, written by Brother Leo. * Speculum stultorum, the \\"Mirror of Fools\\" written by Nigel de Longchamps * Speculum Vitae Humanae, written by Rodericus Zamorensis (Rodrigo Sanchez de Arevalo) Ormulum, written by a certain Orm in Central England, bears an indirect reference to speculum and may be translated as \\"Orm's Mirror\\". It is universal in contents in that it contains the appropriate homiletic materials throughout the Church calendar. The English word mirror appears in William Caxton's Myrrour of the Worlde (1490), one of the first illustrated books printed in English (a translation of L'image du Monde, an overview of the sciences); in the oft-republished A Mirror for Magistrates (1559); and in The Miroir or Glasse of the Synneful Soul, a manuscript translation from the French by the young Queen Elizabeth I of England. The Mirror of Simple Souls is a modern English translation of a similar French work. The Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae (\\"Mirror of the Magnificence of Rome\\") was a Renaissance \\"coffee table book\\" of prints of the sights of Rome, especially the antiquities, produced by the French print seller and publisher Antonio Lafreri (1512‚Äì1577). He had been publishing and distributing such prints, and selling them at his shop in Rome, since the 1540s. In the 1570s he hit on the idea of producing a title page for the albums of prints he also sold. Each copy of the Speculum may have had different contents, as the customer in Rome could make his own selection in the shop and have them bound up.Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae, University of Chicago Library In modern times, the journal Speculum, published by the Medieval Academy of America, covers every aspect of the medieval world.

PC Hooft. This 1642 engraving was painted by Sandrart, etched by Reinier van Persijn, and printed by Danckerts. The poem in Latin at the bottom was written by Caspar Barlaeus. Pieter, Peeter, or Peter Danckerts de Rij, Dankers de Ry, or Peteris Dankersas (1605, in Amsterdam - buried 15 December 1660, Amsterdam). was a Dutch Golden Age painter mostly active in the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden. Life and career He was the son of Cornelis Danckerts de Ry, member of a large family of printers, painters and engravers.Pieter Dankers de Ry biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Cornelis is mentioned in Houbraken's Schouburg as being one of the many teachers of Joachim von Sandrart in 1640-41, though considering Sandrart's age and experience (he had just returned to the North from his Grand Tour to Italy), this was more of a collaboration. Since Filippo Baldinucci later wrote a biographical sketch on Pietro Danckerse de Ry in his list of artists called the Notizie,Fu anche buon pittore di ritratti Pietro Danckerse de Ry, nato in Amsterdam ;'anno 1605. dell'opera del quale molto si servi la Maesta di Vlasislao IV. Re di Pollonia. - entire quote by Baldinucci it is possible that Danckerts visited Italy at some time. In any case Sandrart engraved some of Peter's paintings after this period. Between 1634 and 1638 he moved to Warsaw, and later Danzig, and Vilnius in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Here he was the court painter and architect of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa. According to Houbraken a poem was written in his honor that applauds his work in Poland. In 1648 he moved to be a painter at the court of Queen Christina in Stockholm. Her successor, King Charles X Gustav, held him in high regard. He returned to the Dutch Republic in 1659 and died in Amsterdam in December of the next year. The story that he died in August 1661 as the result of a highway robbery in the R≈´dininkai Forest near Vilnius involves an unnamed artist aged 78, while Danckerts would have been 55. This incident possibly concerns one of Danckerts' successors at the Polish court instead. Parents portraits Peter's portraits of his parents. In 1634 Peter painted pendant portraits of his parents, his father Cornelis the painter and his mother. His mother's portrait hangs in Johannesburg Art Gallery, and his father's portrait hangs in Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.

Most commonly hydrological armor occurs naturally; however, a man-made form is usually called riprap, when shorelines or stream banks are fortified for erosion protection with large boulders or sizable manufactured concrete objects. When armor is associated with beaches in the form of pebbles to medium-sized stones grading from two to 200 millimeters across, the resulting landform is often termed a shingle beach. Hydrological modeling indicates that stream armor typically persists in a flood stage environment.  Hjulstroms Diagram  Hjulstroms Diagram Bed armor is most often transported through entrainment, and more specifically suspension and saltation. Both of these processes involve moving the sediment both near and around the bed of a river. When a sediment is entrained it is being moved downstream through the forces between the layers of water around it, and once it settles it begins to create a layer on the bed of the river. This layer of sediment changes the hydrology of the river around it, as once this layer on the bottom is formed it affects the hydraulics of the river. This layer of sediments on the bed of the river can act as barrier to the incoming flow, and depending on the size and distribution of the grains, can change the river. Understanding the Hjulstroms diagram is important, as it represents at what grain size and flow speed a particle is transported. The slope present at the top left of the graph is due to clay and silt cohesion.  Particle size  The distribution and size of the sediments can sometimes help indicate the type of river, and the general flow direction. The grain distribution of the bed armor is essential to understanding the armor, and its function that is dependent on the size of the armor. For example, if there is a large piece of sediment that sits on the bed armor layer of the river it can change the threshold for critical flow. The change in critical flow at the bottom of the stream or river can change the turbidity of the flow, and create different types of river systems depending on the range of impact the change in flow has. This effect can create a positive loop, with the critical flow disrupting smaller sediments downstream which repeat the process.  Stream power  Stream power expresses the amount of energy that a river is exerting on its bed. The equation is primarily used to understand the force in terms of the water doing work on the bed. Bed armor is directly involved with this equations, when the force on the stream increases the water acting on the sediments can also increase. This can lead to change and movement within the stream in reference to the sediments on the bottom layer.

It was created on 20 February 1745 for the twenty-two-year-old William Beauchamp- Proctor, subsequently Member of Parliament for Middlesex. Born William Beauchamp, he assumed the additional surname of Proctor according to the will of his maternal uncle, George Proctor, of Langley Park, Norfolk. The second Baronet married Mary Palmer, a beauty who was the subject of portraits by George Romney and Benjamin West. The third Baronet was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The fourth Baronet assumed by Royal licence the surname of Proctor- Beauchamp in lieu of Beauchamp-Proctor in 1852 and served as High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1869. He and his wife Catherine Waldegrave had nine children, including the fifth, sixth and seventh Baronets. The fifth Baronet was involved in a scandalous divorce case with his wife, Lady Violet Jocelyn, and Hugh Watt MP. The sixth Baronet, Horace George, was a lieutenant-colonel in the Norfolk Regiment and was killed in action at Suvla Bay, Turkey, during the First World War. He was born on 3 November 1856 and had joined the army in 1878. His previous service included a year in Sudan (1885‚Äì86), for which he was mentioned in despatches, an honour he also received during the Second Boer War. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1902. Retiring in 1904, he was recommissioned at the start of the First World War, in which his nephew Montague Barclay Granville Proctor-Beauchamp served alongside him as a second lieutenant. They were both killed on 12 August 1915 during an abortive advance. The seventh Baronet was a missionary in China and one of the Cambridge Seven. Two other members of the family may also be mentioned. Edward Beauchamp, second son of Reverend William Henry Beauchamp, second son of the third Baronet, was a Liberal politician and was created a Baronet in his own right in 1911 (see Beauchamp baronets). Edward Halhed Beauchamp, third son of George Edward Beauchamp, second son of the second Baronet, was a captain in the Royal Navy.

It is classed as sympathomimetic Œ≤2 agonist and an inhaled bronchodilator asthma medication. Fenoterol is produced and sold by Boehringer Ingelheim as Berotec N and in combination with ipratropium as Berodual N. It was patented in 1962 and came into medical use in 1971 but, in the 1980s, concerns emerged about its safety and its use being associated with an increased risk of death (see below). Adverse effects and toxicity Fenoterol branded as Berotec Fenoterol is a short-acting Œ≤2 agonist that also stimulates Œ≤1 receptors. Fenoterol has more cardiovascular toxicity than isoprenaline or salbutamol. Fenoterol was widely used in New Zealand in the late 1970s and the 1980s until it was removed from the New Zealand drug tariff in 1989 because its introduction and widespread use was associated with an epidemic of asthma deaths. A series of case-control studies demonstrated that asthmatics using fenoterol were more likely to die of asthma compared with controls treated with alternative beta agonists; this risk of asthma deaths was particularly high in severe asthmatics. The mortality rate declined following withdrawal of fenoterol without evidence supporting an alternative explanation for the abrupt rise and fall in asthma deaths. Data did not support confounding by severity as the explanation for the excess mortality. There are alternative short-acting beta agonists that have not been associated with increased mortality e.g. salbutamol.  Stereoisomers  5-(1-Hydroxy-2-{[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino}ethyl)benzene-1,3-diol is a molecule with two different stereogenic centers. Thus, four stereoisomers may exist, the (R,R)-, (R,S)-, (S,R)- and (S,S)-stereoisomers (see the figure below). Fenoterol is a racemate of the (R,R)- and the (S,S)-enantiomers. This racemate is 9 to 20 times more effective, as compared to the racemate of the (R,S)- and (S,R)-enantiomers.

He worked on various technical assignments until he was assigned to the STS-119 spaceflight. In August 2007, Arnold served as an aquanaut during the NEEMO 13 project, an exploration research mission held in Aquarius, the world's only undersea research laboratory. On September 19, 2011, NASA announced that Arnold would participate in the NEEMO 15 mission in October 2011 from the DeepWorker submersible. The DeepWorker is a small submarine used as an underwater stand-in for the Space Exploration Vehicle, which might someday be used to explore the surface of an asteroid. =STS-119= Arnold participated in two spacewalks during the mission. The first EVA by Steven Swanson and Arnold occurred on March 19, 2009, with a duration of 6 hours 7 minutes. After Canadarm2 was released S6 and moved away, the spacewalkers plugged in power and data cables to connect the new hardware. The two spacewalkers also removed launch locks, stowed a keel pin, removed and jettisoned four thermal covers, and deployed the blanket boxes that hold the solar arrays in place during launch. The first spacewalk was devoted to installing the station's new truss segment and preparing the segment's solar arrays for unfolding on the eighth day of the mission. Arnold performed his second EVA on March 23, 2009, with Joseph Acaba with a duration of 6 hours 27 minutes, to move one of the station's two Crew and Equipment and Translation Aid - or CETA - carts. The carts were moved to the port side of the station's truss during the previous mission to give the robotic arm's mobile transporter the best possible access to the starboard truss for the installation of the new truss segment and solar arrays. With that work done, one of the carts was moved back to the station's port side, leaving a cart for use on either side of the truss. The CETA-cart also got a new coupler. The EVA also included lubricating the end effector capture snares on the station's robot arm - similar to what was done to the other end on an STS-126 spacewalk in late 2008. This has been proven to prevent the snare from snagging or not returning snugly into its groove inside the latching mechanism. =Expedition 55/56= A selfie taken by Arnold during an EVA in 2018 In March 2017, Arnold was assigned to ISS Expeditions 55/56. He launched on Soyuz MS-08 on March 21, 2018. Arnold pictured in the Cupola during Expedition 55 On March 29, 2018, Arnold performed his first EVA of the mission, with crewmate Drew Feustel. They installed wireless communications equipment on the station's Tranquility module to enhance payload data processing for the experiment ECOSTRESS (Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station). They also swapped out high-definition video cameras on the port truss of the station's backbone and removed aging hoses from a cooling component on the station's truss. The spacewalk had a duration of 6 hours and 10 minutes, bringing Arnold's cumulative EVA time to over 18 hours. Arnold returned to Earth on October 4, 2018.

He was the son of Colonel Forbes Francis Hely.  In New South Wales  At eighteen years of age, in the year 1812, he married Georgina Lindsay Bucknell. While there is no evidence of the actual time when Hely came to Australia, it is known that he was given the post of Principal Superintendent of the Convicts in New South Wales sometime in early 1823. However, it was later in the year that he arrived in Sydney, with his wife and children, to actually take up the post (a post he would hold throughout the entirety of the rest of his life). Hely held several other additional positions of public and social influence becoming a justice of the peace in 1825 and president of the Board of Magistrates in 1826. The year following, he became acting superintendent of police, and, in 1831, was appointed a member of the Assignment Board. Later, in 1832, Hely applied for an appointment as stipendiary magistrate at Brisbane Water, where he had a farm and had commissioned a home, Wyoming Cottage. However, he was offered a salary increase of ¬£100 from the ¬£200 he was already earning to induce him to stay as superintendent of convicts (an office in which he had been quite successful in the past). Two years later, Hely became a foundation director of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney.  Land ownership  Hely established a farm, which he called Wyoming, after he was granted almost 550 hectares of land at Narara, Brisbane Water in 1824, and, in doing so, became the first European man to settle there permanently and to grow a citrus fruit orchard garden. It is possible that Hely named his property after the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, from a famous poem, Gertrude of Wyoming by Thomas Campbell, dated 1809. This name predates the use of Wyoming for the U.S. state, which was officially named in 1865. In 1829, Hely's land was expanded to approximately , or a little over 1600 hectares, after further grants in the districts of Ourimbah and Tuggerah. The land Hely was granted in Tugerah at one time incited a fierce conflict with William Cape, a free settler who did not report his selection of land to the government before clearing around of land and building a barn on the land which was later granted to Hely. The Darkinyung and Guringai peoples were the traditional custodians of the area, although by 1828 conflict and smallpox had decimated their populations, with only 5 family groups of 65 people remaining.  Death  In 1836, Hely began to suffer periods of bad health, and he was recommended for retirement, with a pension to live on. However, before the pension could be approved, Hely died of apoplexy in Sydney. He was survived by his wife and his five children (three daughters and two sons). Grave of Frederick Augustus Hely, Wyoming, NSW, Australia His grave is located at 559 Pacific Highway, Wyoming. The headstone reads: > \\"IN MEMORY OF FREDERICK AUGUSTUS HELY ESQ DIED 8th SEPTEMBER 1836 AGED 42 > YEARS HIS LOVED REMAINS LIE IN THIS SPOT BY HIS OWN REQUEST\\" Inscription on the grave of Frederick Augustus Hely The homestead of Hely's former farm (now Wyoming Cottage), its former stables (now a residence known as The Grange) and Hely's Grave all survive and are listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register.

General types include: * Administrative Facilities * Ammunition Storage Facilities * Commissary Facilities * Correctional Facilities * Fortifications * Hospitals * Housing * Mess * Military Intelligence Facilities * Museums * POL (Petroleum, Oils, & Lubricants) Storage and Handling Facilities * Recreation Facilities * Research Facilities * Training Facilities * Utility Structures * Vehicle Repair, Maintenance, & Storage Facilities * Weapons and Ammunition Production Facilities  Administrative facilities  Military organizations of all types must support a wide range of administrative functions including personnel management, accounting, and procurement. Some facilities are quite similar to civilian office buildings while others are converted from other military uses and can be quite idiosyncratic.  Ammunition storage facilities  Ammunition is frequently stored in small quantities in reinforced structures which are widely separated. Standard designs are sometimes called \\"igloos\\".  Commissary facilities  Traditionally, military units provided most of the rations, uniforms, and other supplies needed by most military personnel. However, modern units often provide fewer items and many personnel must buy some items with their own funds. Personnel with families also must buy food, clothing, and other necessities for the family. This has created the need for modern commissary and ‚ÄúPX‚Äù (post exchange) buildings. In some cases, these buildings are similar to modern supermarkets.  Correctional facilities  Most military installations have small jails for temporary holding of suspects or short term punishment of minor offenses. However, military organizations also have larger, centralized facilities for longer term incarceration of persons convicted of more serious offenses. The main correctional facility of the US Army, Air Force, and Marines is the United States Disciplinary Barracks located at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  Fortifications  Fortifications vary widely in nature depending on the mission and type of unit engaged.  Hospitals  Full-service military hospitals are a fairly recent innovation in military history. Prior to the nineteenth century, military hospitals as we know them today did not exist. Soldiers wounded in combat were treated in the field or in makeshift facilities commandeered near the field of battle. Medical technology at the time was such that most serious wounds were fatal and, accordingly, there was little need for facilities that provided for long- term care and recuperation. Battlefield amputations were one of the most common procedures and were only successful in saving the life of the victim in a limited number of cases. However, beginning in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, advances in blood transfusion, anesthesia, antibiotics, and trauma treatment meant that many more soldiers could survive wounds although the treatment time was much longer. Also, advances in the treatment of infectious diseases meant that many more personnel required treatment for non-combat conditions. All of these conditions, plus an increasing number of personnel with families, have led to the construction of full service military hospitals. These hospitals treat both members of the military and their families.  Housing  Military housing includes barracks, UOQs (unescorted or \\"bachelor\\" officer quarters), and family housing. The age and condition of these facilities varies widely. A few officer family housing units are very historical in nature and can be quite large and ornate. Most family and UOQ housing is now similar in nature to civilian housing stock. In most advanced countries, barracks housing has been modernized, but remnants of housing from World War II and older periods still remains in the inventory.  Mess  ‚ÄúMess‚Äù is the military term for any facility serving food to large groups. Some mess halls in remote locations can be rudimentary, but others in established locations can be similar to modern cafeterias.  Military intelligence facilities  These facilities are highly secured. Modern facilities involve intensive use of electronics and computer technology.  Museums  Because of the role military actions have played in determining world history, military museums are common. They range widely from small facilities memorializing the actions of local units to large, sophisticated facilities devoted to an entire branch of service or entire wars.  POL (Petroleum, Oils, & Lubricants) storage and handling facilities  These facilities are engineered to provide safe storage and handling of petroleum- based materials. Newer facilities include containments to prevent environmental pollution from due to spills.  Recreation facilities  Recreation facilities for both military personnel and their families. Athletic facilities are common as are officers' clubs and NCO/enlisted personnel clubs. Recreation facilities are ussualy exercise or athletic entertainment type places.  Research facilities  Military organizations conduct extensive research operations and maintain extensive purpose-built research facilities to support those activities.  Training facilities  Traditional military training facilities focused on physical conditioning and skills training. Newer facilities make extensive use of computer simulations of various kinds to provide more hours or training in more realistic situations at lower cost and with lower risk to personnel. Military academies are devoted entirely to training military officer cadets. Facilities for advanced training of senior officers also exist. Examples include the US Army Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth, KS.  Utility structures  Many military installations are large enough to require their own utility systems. Water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, and electric power generation stations are found on many military installations.  Vehicle repair, maintenance, & storage facilities  Vehicle repair shops can be very large and built to accommodate large vehicles. Aircraft hangars are some of the largest and most specialized military buildings.  Weapons & ammunition production facilities  Production of ammunition is now largely outsourced to industry contractors. However, facilities such as Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant produced small arms ammunition for the US Military for many years. More exotic facilities such as Rocky Mountain Arsenal (now decommissioned) was the main facility for production of chemical weapons.

The Regret Stakes is a Grade III American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-old fillies over a distance of one and one-eighth miles (9 furlongs) on the Turf scheduled annually in mid-June near the end of the Spring Meet at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. The event offers a purse of $100,000. History The race is named for Harry Payne Whitney's champion filly Regret, the first filly to win the 1915 Kentucky Derby. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, she is #71 and in a poll among members of the American Trainers Association, she was voted the third greatest filly in American racing history. Regret was undefeated as a two-year-old, she made her three-year old debut in the Derby, winning in wire-to-wire fashion. The race was inaugural running on 16 May 1970 and was run over a distance of 6 furlongs and won by Tree Pigeons ridden by veteran jockey Tommy Barrows in a fast time of 1:10. The Regret Stakes was run at six furlongs for its first twelve runnings (1970‚Äì1981). From 1982 to 1987 the race was run at a distance of one mile and from 1988 to 2002 it was run at miles. From 2003 to present it has been run at its current distance of miles. The event was classified a Grade III event for the first time in 1999.

Education and early career After graduating from Tsinghua University in 1917, Xiang went to the United States for further studies and enrolled at Yale University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in American and English Literature. He later transferred to the George Washington University Law School, where he studied international law and obtained his JD. After his return to China in 1925, Xiang Zhejun taught law at a number of schools, including Peking University and Beijing Jiaotong University. After the establishment of the Nationalist Government in 1927, Xiang held a number of positions in several government bureaus, including the ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs.Ëøú‰∏úÊ£ÄÂØüÂÆò‚Äî‚ÄîÂêëÂì≤ÊµöÂÖàÁîüÁÆÄ‰ªã Tokyo Trial In January 1946, Xiang was appointed the prosecutor for the Republic of China in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, in preparation for which he vigorously collected oral and material evidence. Instead of prosecuting Japanese war crimes dating from the outbreak of hostilities in July 1937, Xiang also managed to persuade the court to prosecute Japanese wars crimes dating back to the Huanggutun Incident in 1928, when the Kanto Army assassinated Zhang Zuolin. During the trial, Xiang Zhejun become known for confronting defendants such as Iwane Matsui, Itagaki Seishiro and Doihara Kenji with evidence establishing their guilt of war crimes. Among other things Xiang established the guilt of Iwane, who was confronted with evidence of the atrocities, including Harold John Timperley's reports in the Manchester Guardian.Article from Baidu Baike However, following the political directives of Chiang Kai-shek, Xiang did not investigate crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army in Communist based areas such as the \\"Three Alls Policy\\". Thus, military leaders like Yasuji Okamura were not prosecuted before the Tokyo tribunal. He also let down evidence about the use of chemical weapons authorized by the Imperial General Headquarters.Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, 2000, p.594. Later life After his return to China, Xiang Zhejun refused Chiang Kai-shek's invitation to serve as a prosecutor in the Supreme Court, but chose to teach at Shanghai College of Finance and Economics instead. He remained on the mainland after the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Even though Xiang had already retired when the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1965, he became a target for political persecution. He died in Shanghai in 1987 at the age of 91.

In Crusader times it was known as the Castle of Gibelet , also spelled Giblet. It is adjacent to the Phoenician archaeological site containing the ruins of the Temple of Baalat Gebal and the Temple of the Obelisks. History Byblos Castle The castle was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century from indigenous limestone and the remains of Roman structures. The finished structure was surrounded by a moat. It belonged to the Genoese Embriaco family, whose members were the Lords of Gibelet. Saladin captured the town and castle in 1188 and partially dismantled the walls in 1190. Later, the Crusaders recaptured Byblos and rebuilt the fortifications of the castle in 1197. In 1369, the castle had to fend off an attack from Cypriot vessels from Famagusta. The Byblos Castle has distinguished historical buildings for neighbors. Nearby stand a few Egyptian temples, the Phoenician royal necropolis and the Roman amphitheatre. Description The Crusader castle of Gibelet is \\"the finest example\\" (Boas) of a new 12th-century type, which mixes the castrum-type with the turris-type castle: a roughly square set of walls strengthened by corner towers, built around a central donjon,David Nicolle, Crusader Castles in the Holy Land 1097-1192, Osprey, 2004, pp. 11-12 thus forming two layers of defense. Byblos Site Museum Limestone anchor (1800 BCE) Exhibits at the museum inside the Byblos Castle The castle houses the Byblos site museum. It displays remains of the excavations undertaken on the site of the archeological preserve of Byblos, although the most important finds are displayed in the National Museum of Beirut.

Biography Beauchamp-Proctor was born at Langley Hall, Loddon, Norfolk, the eldest son of Sir Thomas Beauchamp-Proctor, 2nd Baronet, and Mary, the second daughter of Robert Palmer, of Sonning, Berkshire. His younger brothers were Colonel Richard Beauchamp-Proctor of the Grenadier Guards (d. 11 August 1850) and Captain Robert Beauchamp-Proctor of the Madras Artillery (d. 23 May 1813). His nephew, Edward Halhead Beauchamp- Proctor, also served as a naval officer. Beauchamp-Proctor entered the Royal Navy on 4 September 1794, with the rank of able seaman, aboard the 32-gun frigate under Captain Joseph Sydney Yorke. On 22 August 1795, now a midshipman, he took part in the engagement off Norway between four Royal Navy frigates and two frigates and a cutter from the Navy of the Batavian Republic. Stag captured the 36-gun frigate Alliante with 240 men aboard, after an action of about an hour, in which the enemy lost between 40 and 50 men killed and wounded, and the British only 4 killed, and 13, including Beauchamp-Proctor, wounded. He continued to serve in the Stag on the home station until January 1798, when he joined the 98-gun ship , under Captain John Child Purvis, off Lisbon. The following July he moved to the frigate , under Captain Robert Gambier Middleton, in the Mediterranean, where he was lent for short periods to the frigates under Captain Henry Digby, and under Captain George Cockburn. Beauchamp-Proctor was commissioned as acting-lieutenant aboard the ship , flagship of Admiral Lord Keith, in August 1800, and on 22 October was transferred to the frigate under Captain Thomas Stephenson. He received confirmation of his commission from the Admiralty on 25 February 1801, and then served in the Egyptian campaign, receiving the Turkish gold medal. He was promoted to commander on 29 April 1802, and in April 1803, was appointed to command of the bomb vessel . In July and August 1804 he served under Captain Robert Dudley Oliver in the bombardment of Le Havre, before being given command of the brig-sloop in August 1804. Beauchamp-Proctor spent the next six months in Saracen, cruising in the Channel, before sailing for the East Indies in March 1805 aboard . On his arrival in July he was given acting-command of the 36-gun frigate , but was not confirmed in his post-rank until 5 September 1806. On 21 November 1808, at sunset, D√©daigneuse was stationed off the Isle de France when she encountered the French 36-gun frigate returning from a cruise in the Indian Ocean. D√©daigneuse gave chase and by midnight the two ships were no more than half a mile apart. D√©daigneuse fired two or three shots from her bow-chasers, and then a full broadside, as S√©millante tacked. D√©daigneuse followed suit, but because of the lightness of the wind, the ship would not come round. A boat was lowered down to tow her round, and she was finally able to pursue the Frenchman, now some distance ahead. Unfortunately, D√©daigneuse had lost a great deal of copper, being very foul, and at best a bad working ship, so gradually dropped further astern. Beauchamp-Proctor eventually abandoned the chase at about 5 p.m, and soon afterwards S√©millante anchored in Port Louis. D√©daigneuse continued to patrol the waters off the Isle de France until her water and provisions were almost expended, before sailing to Madagascar to reprovision, and then sailed to Bombay. When the commander-in-chief expressed himself dissatisfied with his conduct, Captain Beauchamp-Proctor requested a court-martial, which was held aboard in Bombay harbour on 27 March 1809. Every officer of his ship gave strong evidence in the captain's favour, and the court acquitted him of all blame, laying responsibility squarely on the poor sailing qualities of D√©daigneuse. Beauchamp-Proctor returned to Britain on sick-leave in November 1809, and despite never serving at sea again, received regular promotions; to rear- admiral in November 1846, to vice-admiral in September 1850, and in June 1857 to admiral, on the retired list. On 20 May 1812 he married Anne Gregory (1792-1859), the daughter of Thomas Gregory and Julia Elizabeth Brograve, and the niece and heir of Thomas Brograve, of Springfield Place, Essex, and granddaughter of Sir Berney Brograve, 1st Baronet. They had three sons and four daughters. Beauchamp-Proctor was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for Norfolk in August 1820, and succeeded his father as third Baronet on 29 June 1827. He was nominated as High Sheriff for Norfolk in November 1831. Beauchamp-Proctor died on 14 March 1861, and he, alongside many other members of his family, was buried at the church of St Michael and All Saints, close to his family home.

The school was co-founded by brothers Stephen Batchelder and David Batchelder and serves grades 6-12. History JMPS was founded by the Batchelder brothers to \\"challenge committed students with a robust, traditional education emphasizing America‚Äôs history and system of government.\\"JMPS homepage The vision the Batchelder brothers were aiming for at James Madison is a Midwestern, traditional education from about 50 years ago, with some positive modern influences sprinkled in. It is a classical liberal arts school which seeks to promote understanding of American history. The school focuses on developing students' understanding of the United States Constitution. James Madison Preparatory School opened its doors in the fall of 2000. Fifty-three students showed up on the first day. JMPS had received its charter from the State Charter Board in 1999, having received the highest score ever given for a charter school application up to that time. The first year only 9th, 10th, and 11th graders populated the campus, but by the second year, the school had grown to include 7th, 8th, and 12th graders. The first graduating class at James Madison Preparatory School was the Class of 2002, which only had four graduates. The largest graduating class was the Class of 2012, which had 31 graduates. left  Code of conduct  JMPS has seven codes of conduct: self-reliance, honesty, integrity, courage, respectfulness, strong work ethic, and responsibility. Academics JMPS was ranked as an \\"Excelling\\" school in Arizona for the 2008-2009 school year based on AIMS test results. JMPS offers English Grammar, Civics, American History (one year in junior high and two full years in high school), World History, Geography, Algebra, Geometry, Astronomy, Economics, Biology, Latin, Chemistry, Calculus, Geology, Western Philosophy, Physics, Physical Education, Political Science, Fine Arts, Composition, and Literature. Also included in their curriculum are a few courses designed to provide students with real world, practical life skills. Balancing a checkbook, living within a budget, paying taxes, shopping for insurance, cooking a meal, changing a car tire, and sewing on a button are among the many varied skills that students are exposed to in \\"self-reliance\\" classes. School culture and student government JMPS has a dress code for students, emphasizing business attire such as slacks, dress shoes, and a polo or oxford shirt. All students are required to participate in a daily chore at the end of each school day, where the students perform minor routine maintenance on the campus such as taking out classroom trash, vacuuming classrooms, and cleaning bathroom windows. The daily chore is scheduled to take between 5 and 10 minutes. JMPS has a student-run high school government modeled after the American three- branch system of government. * Each year, the school holds an election to decide on the next year's student government president, who then appoints a student cabinet to help manage student affairs, including student fundraisers to fund events such as school dances. * The Student President also nominates students to serve on a student Supreme Court, which judges and sentences minor student misconduct cases. Up to nine students may serve on the student court, for terms of up to two years. Students may be re-appointed when their terms end. * Students are placed into homerooms, where they decide on two representatives (for each homeroom) to the school's Student Senate, which votes on Cabinet and Court appointments. The remaining students are encouraged to be involved in the Student House of Representatives, which votes on bills introduced to aid in student government. A junior high student council was installed in 2007 as a liaison between junior high students and the high school government. The James Madison Preparatory Junior High student council was set up for two reasons: first, to train junior high students in the way of the government system. This is a small way to prepare them for the experience of the high school's student government. The second reason the council was created was to give middle school students a way to plan activities for the junior high. = Houses = Students at Madison Prep are placed into \\"houses,\\" which are also called \\"homerooms\\" or \\"advisor groups.\\" The high school has ten houses, and the junior high has four. Each house holds approximately 17 students, and one faculty member is assigned to every house. The faculty advisor serves as the contact person between the school and the parents. The advisors work with the students in their group to help guide them through their academic career and their practical college preparation. The houses are designed to be the small family units that make up the whole school community. All houses compete with each other for house points throughout the school year to earn the honor of being Top House. House points are earned in a wide variety of ways, and a scoreboard that shows the current standings is kept up in the front office. = Clubs = JMPS students in 8-12th grade are given the opportunity to select one club-class first and second trimester. A trimester club-class meets for two class periods a week and is worth half a credit for high school students (two in total each year). There is a variety of clubs offered such as Anime Club, Art Club, Chess Club, Choreography Club, Debate Club, Improv Club, Student Newspaper, Health and First-Aid Club, Yearbook, Weight Training Club, Archery Club, Quidditch Club, and Spanish Club. Students can also decide to be in study hall, but are not awarded the half credit for this. = Academic Decathlon Team = JMPS AcaDec Team of 2016 JMPS offers the Academic Decathlon Team as a club-class in order to eliminate conflicts with extracurriculars. As a club-class, the students also continue to earn academic credit for their participation. However, one major change from previous years is that the club class is now a fee club class. The fee for the season is $200. The cost is to help the school offset the expense of annual study materials, the annual team registration, Scrimages, and transportation and lodging at the regional competition. The season runs during the 1st and 2nd trimesters. The head coach is Dr. Matthew Quigley and assistant coach is Mary Lambert. The role of the coaches is to help the team prepare for the competition. The team also enlists help from other JMPS staff members. The team members consist of three \\"A\\" students, three \\"B\\" students and three \\"C\\" students, as well as one alternate for each of the three grade groups. The students compete as individuals, winning individual gold, silver and bronze medals, and their scores count toward an overall team score. Winning teams move on to state and national competitions. Each student competes in the following ten academic events: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, mathematics, music, science, social science and speech. The final event of the day is the Super Quiz in which the entire team competes in a game-show type setting in front of an audience of family and friends. JMPS 2015 volleyball team =Athletics= All sports teams participate in the Canyon Athletic Association. The school participates in: * Fall: football, girls' volleyball, Sparx (dance line), Ultimate Frisbee, cross country* *Winter: girls' and boys' basketball *Spring: coed soccer, track and field, boys' baseball, girls' softball *In the 2015-2016 school year due to lack of student interest there were not enough participants in order to have a cross country team. =Fine arts= Kiss Me Kate James Madison has a wide variety of extracurriculars, and students are encouraged to participate and broaden their horizons. Fine arts programs include a choir, string section and a rock band. These perform rehearsed pieces at school concerts, and are open to any students interested in joining them. The presence of these groups on campus is determined entirely by student interest; the JMPS fine arts program also included a jazz band until 2007. JMPS also fields a student drumline and color guard, which practice during the fall and perform at football games for JMPS. Each year they hold a performance called \\"Glownight,\\" which is followed by a bonfire led by the seniors. JMPS also puts on several theatrical productions directed by Steven Batchelder (fall play and spring musical) and Rachel Curtis-Hutson (8th grade play) each year, including: * A fall/winter play (open to audition for grades 9-12) * A spring musical (open to audition for grades 7-12) * A spring production performed by the 8th grade References External links * James Madison Preparatory School * Schoolmatters * Best Charter Schools in Maricopa County * http://www.azcaa.com/page/show/891445-james-madison-preparatory-school Category:Public high schools in Arizona Category:Education in Tempe, Arizona Category:Educational institutions established in 2000 Category:Schools in Maricopa County, Arizona Category:Charter schools in Arizona ","title":"James Madison Preparatory School"},{"id":"11812781","text":"Thomas Dew may refer to: * Thomas Roderick Dew (1802‚Äì1846), American educator and writer * Thomas Dew (politician) (died c. 1681), Virginia landowner and politician ","title":"Thomas Dew"},{"id":"11812798","text":"Timothy McKay may refer to: * Tim McKay (1947‚Äì2006), environmentalist * Timothy A.

The land that is most commonly referred to as Bodie Island was at one time a true island, but in 1811 Roanoke Inlet, which had separated it from the Currituck Banks in the north, closed.http://core.ecu.edu/geology/mallinsond/IGCP_NC_Field_Trip_Guide_rev1.pdf As a result, the Currituck Banks and Bodie Island are now one contiguous peninsula, joined together at the Nags Head area, where the inlet once flowed. Today, either name can be used to refer to peninsula as a whole, but both portions colloquially retain their historical names. From the southern tip at Oregon Inlet, the peninsula stretches largely northwest out of North Carolina and into Virginia until terminating at Rudee Inlet at Owl Creek in Virginia Beach. At Sandbridge, Virginia Beach, Virginia, the peninsula is tied to the mainland by low tidal swamps and causeways road . The entire peninsula is approximately 72 miles in length, following the shoreline. Places of interest Bodie Island Light The peninsula is home to two lighthouses, Bodie Island Light and Currituck Beach Light. The Wright Brothers National Monument also has a beacon and is found on the peninsula. Jockey's Ridge, the tallest sand dune on the East Coast, is found on the peninsula. The Cape Hatteras National Seashore protects the southernmost part of Bodie Island, and the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge, Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge and False Cape State Park protect portions of the northern part of the peninsula. History Bodie Island was originally known as Bodie's Island or Body's Island and was named for a family of that name, variously written as \\"Body\\" \\"Boddye\\" \\"Boddy\\" and \\"Bodie\\" that settled there. Robert Boddy/Boddie emigrated to Virginia from London, England on August 10, 1635 on HMS Safety. He settled in Isle of Wight and some of his descendants later settled in what later became North Carolina, South Carolina and Mississippi. Bodie island was named for his descendants who settled the area. The family was originally from Ingatestone, Essex, England which is where their coat of arms originated as well, augmentation by Elizabeth I to John Boddie for service during the naval battle with the Spanish Armada. Their history is noted in Seventeenth Century Isle of Wight County, Virginia Folklore sometimes attributes the naming of the island to the dead \\"bodies\\" of drowned sailors that washed up from the ships that ran aground and sank off the Outer Banks in what is now known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Inlets frequently open and close along the Outer Banks, making landform naming inconsistent. Bodie Island, when it was an island, extended farther south than it does today. The island was originally formed around 1738, when New Inlet opened, separating Bodie Island from Hatteras Island to the south. The opening of Oregon Inlet in 1846 truncated the southern portion of Bodie Island, forming a new island situated between Bodie and Hatteras. The new barrier island was given the name Pea Island, but the wider, more powerful Oregon Inlet led to the eventual closure of New Inlet around 1933. Pea Island thus became a part of Hatteras Island until 2011 when New Inlet reopened during Hurricane Irene. Near the North Carolina-Virginia state line, the Currituck Inlet and Musketo Inlets along with Caffey's Inlet to the south in the vicinity of Duck once existed, which made the Currituck Banks itself a chain of barrier islands. Currituck inlet served as the boundary between the two states in the early 18th century. The old Currituck Inlet closed around 1728, Caffey's Inlet closed in 1811, New Currituck Inlet had closed by 1828 and Musketo Inlet finally closed in 1882 creating the long peninsula extending from Sandbridge to Oregon Inlet that is seen today. Explorer John Lawson mentions Bodies Island just once in his 1709 book A New Voyage to Carolina, when discussing fauna of North Carolina, in particular, a species of rabbit. He wrote the following: \\"I was told of several that were upon Bodies Island by Ronoak, which came from that Ship of Bodies;\\" This would indicate that Bodie Island was so named as early as 1709. Localities The following is a list of places found on the peninsula, listed from south to north. * Nags Head, North Carolina * Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina * Kitty Hawk, North Carolina * Southern Shores, North Carolina * Duck, North Carolina * Corolla, North Carolina * Carova Beach, North Carolina * Sandbridge, Virginia Accessibility Bodie Island can be accessed from North Carolina mainland from the Wright Memorial Bridge, originally built in 1966. It can also be accessed from U.S. Route 64 since the Washington Baum Bridge opened in 1994. Motorists driving north on the Outer Banks from Hatteras and Pea Islands reach the Currituck Banks on NC highway 12. The north end of the peninsula is accessible by Sandpiper and Sandfiddler Roads via Sandbridge Road, but there is no highway connecting the Virginia portion of the Currituck Banks with the North Carolina portion, and even driving on the beach is no longer permitted north of the North Carolina border. Plans for an additional access point near Corolla which would be called the Mid-Currituck Bridge are currently on hold.

The school was established in 2000 and caters for early learning and K-12 education. The school is named in honour of Peter Moyes, the first Director of the Anglican Schools' Commission.  History  In 1997, the Anglican Schools' Commission was in need of a campus in the Mindarie region. Construction of the school began in 2000, incorporating solely a primary school building. The school opened shortly after, with the construction of the Middle School and Science buildings completed one year later. In the years following, many features were added to the school such as the Creative Arts building and the auditorium (named the \\"Allan Shaw Centre\\" after the school's first principal, Allan Shaw). The construction of the senior school building finished in 2012. In 2016, both a gymnasium and a new administration building were added to the school. School crest The school crest has many symbolic meanings. The Bishop mitre placed at the top of the crest signifies the connection between the School and the Anglican Church. The left panel of the shield depicts white outlined waves in a green background. The waves represent the location of the school being near the ocean. The green represents one of the school's primary colours and its location in Mindarie. One of the many meanings for Mindarie can be \\"place of green water\\". The right panel depicts the stems of grass trees which gives a linked connection to the family name of Peter Moyes. Moyes is an old French name for Moses, who as a baby was set adrift on the Nile River in a small craft of bulrushes to save him from slaughter by the Pharaoh's Egyptian guards. It also symbolises another meaning of Mindarie: \\"dry leaves from a grasstree\\". The book represents learning and the Greek letters Alpha and Omega symbolise \\"the beginning and the end\\", meaning learning continues all through life. House system The school has five houses: *Lingiari House - named after Vincent Lingiari *Hollows House - named after Fred Hollows *Durack House - named after Mary Durack *Cuthbert House - named after Betty Cuthbert *Florey House - named after Howard Florey Every year the houses compete in a variety of activities, most commonly inter-house sporting carnivals. These include a swimming carnival, a cross country carnival and an athletics carnival. Participation in inter-school sports carnivals is optional, competing against other schools in sports such as netball, basketball, soccer and athletics.

The school campus is situated on flat land in the rugged mountains of eastern Kentucky. There are 597 students currently enrolled in grades 9-12. Located approximately ten miles south of Pikeville on US 23, the school receives students from three elementary schools and two middle schools. In 1990, school administrators decided to merge two local schools, Dorton High School and Virgie High School, which had both been in existence for several decades, into one. Twenty million dollars was spent on the undertaking. History Shelby Valley is the result of the consolidation of Virgie and Dorton High Schools. The current principal is Greg Napier, assisted by vice principal Derwood Ratliff. The school's logo was conceived and designed by artist and designer Mickey Glover in 2001. The school song was written in the first year the school opened by Class of 1991 graduate Darren Branham. Student activities The school has excelled in sports for both girls and boys, including basketball, football, soccer, cross country, track, various academic teams, marching band and volleyball. In 2008, the marching band made it to the KMEA State Finals, making it the second marching band from Pike County to earn this distinction. In 1990 the varsity football team made KHSAA history as the first team ever to make the state playoffs in its first year of existence. Known as \\"The Crunch Bunch,\\" the team finished with a 7-4 regular season record that stood for nearly ten years as the schools winningest season until it was finally bested in 1999 when they finished 9‚Äì2. In 2014 the football team with a 11‚Äì3 record advanced to the KHSAA 2A State Semi-finals (https://scoreboard.12dt.com/scoreboard/khsaa/kyfb14/tournament_134002) marking their highest yearly win total. They followed up the next year winning their first back-to-back District title. In 2010, the school won the 2010 PNC Bank/KHSAA Boys' Sweet Sixteen basketball championship. It was the first school from Pike County to win the title and also the first team in the state to win the Sweet 16 and the All \\"A\\" State Title in the same year.

His father Andriambelomasina bequeathed him the rule of Avaradrano while designating his nephew Ramboasalama to follow Andrianjafy in the order of succession. Andrianjafy did not accept this decree, instead preferring that his own son succeed him, and sought retribution against citizens of Avaradrano who acknowledged the latent authority of his nephew. In order to prevent Ramboasalama from rising to power, Andrianjafy devised a series of failed plans to kill his nephew. The king's ineffectiveness as a ruler and despotic behavior contributed to declining popularity among the people of Avaradrano. Popular support for Ramboasalama produced a coup d'√©tat in which he replaced Andrianjafy as King Andrianampoinimerina. Andrianjafy fled to Ilafy, where he rallied an army and tried unsuccessfully to recapture the throne. He was put to death in 1787 by followers of Andrianampoinimerina. Early life Andrianjafy was a son of King Andriambelomasina of Imerina Avaradrano and his first wife, Rasoherimananitany. When he was born, an astrologer made an unfavorable prediction, declaring, \\"This child will not possess what Andrianjakanavalomandimby and Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana left - he will fritter it away.\\"Callet (1908), pp. 74-75 As a young man he married Ranavalondrajaka of Ilafy,Callet (1908), p. 74 with whom he had two sons, Ralaitokana and Ratsiantahana, and one daughter, Ratsimiantanasoa.Callet (1908), p. Before his death, King Andriambelomasina assigned his sons to govern four fiefs within the territory, giving the largest and easternmost territory of Avaradrano to Andrianjafy. At the same time he designated his sister's son Ramboasalama to follow Andrianjafy in the order of succession, stating \\"Ramboasalama will succeed Andrianjafy, because today I give the right to rule to Andrianjafy, but tomorrow and at the end it will belong to Ramboasalama.\\"Callet (1908), p. 49 Reign In 1770 Andrianjafy succeeded upon the death of his father, who was one of many victims of a major famine in Imerina. Oral histories recount that Andrianjafy felt his authority was threatened by his nephew Ramboasalama, who frequently made promises to the populace regarding his future reign. Andrianjafy's jealousy prompted him to put to death citizens of his territory who engaged his nephew in such promises.Callet (1908), p. 70 Andrianjafy occasionally displayed his power in despotic fashion, such as by engaging the armies of a Sakalava prince to attack Hiaramy and Faliary, two communities already under his control, and massacring the inhabitants without provocation. Andrianjafy failed to consistently apply the law in his realm, particularly in regard to the punishment of criminals. The resulting increase in impunity and decline in security in Avaradrano contributed to declining popular support of his rule. The king's public image was further tarnished by his increasingly hostile behavior toward Ramboasalama, in disregard of the wishes of Andrianjafy's father, Andriambelomasina.Callet (1908), p. 80 Oral history describes him as prone to anger and violence,Callet (1908), p. 86 which he did not hesitate to inflict against women and children.Callet (1908), p. 87 He is also said to have frequently seized the property and valuables of his people for his own use without justification or compensation. Dethronement Initially, Andrianjafy may have been willing to accept his father's declared order of succession. This most likely changed when Ranavalondrazaka, Andrianjafy's wife, unexpectedly gave birth to a son.Callet (1908), p. 79 She persuaded Andrianjafy to disregard his father's decree and name their own son Ralaitokana as successor in place of Ramboasalama.Callet (1908), p. 75 Andrianjafy agreed to this proposal and devised a series of ruses to kill his nephew and clear the path to the throne for his son. In one instance, Andrianjafy invited his nephew to listen to music from a nearby cliff, intending to push him over the edge; Andriantsimitovizainitrimo, Andrianjafy's brother, warned his nephew of the plot, and Ramboasalama declined the invitation on the pretext of illness. In another instance, Andrianjafy claimed to be ill and sent for Ramboasalama with the intention of murdering him once they were alone together, but once again Andrianjafy's brother warned his nephew of the danger. The king then planned to have Ramboasalama murdered during a planned excursion through a nearby swamp, but Ramboasalama was warned and stayed behind. Andrianjafy became bolder and decided to send a group of assassins to Ramboasalama's residence in Ambohimanga; confident of his plan, he showed the funeral goods he had prepared for Ramboasalama to his brother, and then departed his stronghold at Ambohimanga for a circumcision ceremony to be held at Ilafy. Andriantsimitovizainitrimo promptly sent a messenger to his nephew instructing him to flee. Rather than leave Ambohimanga, Ramboasalama followed the advice of an elder who instructed him to sacrifice a ram to invoke ancestral protection. The elder then gathered the twelve most respected men of Ambohimanga and thirty soldiers, and rallied them to enforce the decree of Andriambelomasina by overthrowing Andrianjafy and swearing allegiance to Ramboasalama, who took the throne name Andrianampoinimerina. The support of the Tsimahafotsy, inhabitants of Ambohimanga, ensured the defense of the city against efforts by Andrianjafy to reclaim his capital and his authority.Callet (1908), pp. 76-77 Enraged, Andrianjafy took revenge against his brother Andriantsimitovizainitrimo, whom he murdered by pulling him from his bed, which was raised in the traditional style over fifteen feet above the ground.Callet (1908), p. 78 Andrianjafy rallied the people of his home village of Ilafy to fight against those of Ambohimanga. Both sides were armed with spears and firearms. An initial battle at Marintampona saw the Ilafy army defeated. Both sides regrouped for a second confrontation at Amboniloha, which took place at night and did not end in a definitive win for either side. In the morning, Andrianjafy moved his army north of Anosy and the two sides clashed again in a battle that lasted two days. The Ilafy army lost the skirmish and retreated to their village. After losing these battles, the residents of Ilafy decided to submit to Andrianampoinimerina. To rid themselves of Andrianjafy, the people encouraged him to travel to Antananarivo and Alasora to seek allies in the defense of their town. Once he had departed, the villagers barred the town gates and announced their desire to enforce the decree of Andriambelomasina. Seeking support to recapture the throne, Andrianjafy traveled to Antananarivo, Ambohipeto, Alasora and Anosizato, but each time he was rebuffed.Callet (1908), pp. 84-86 Death Having failed to rally an army to retake Ambohimanga, in 1787 Andrianjafy was approached by messengers who claimed they regretted their betrayal and wished to reinstate him as king. The messengers carried him on a royal palanquin to their village in the north, using a circuitous route that disoriented him. He realized too late that the porters had taken him deep into Andrianampoinimerina's territory; they bound him with rope and brought him to his nephew. Andrianampoinimerina was prepared to let his uncle go free after submitting, but the people of Ambohimanga desired vengeance for the violence and injustices the fallen king had inflicted upon them and their families. Andrianampoinimerina took a walk to distract himself while his followers carried Andrianjafy to a nearby location where he was put to death.Callet (1908), pp. 87-88 Oral history provides different accounts of Andrianjafy's death. He is said to have died either by strangling or by being placed head- first in a vat of rice. His place of death has been given as a valley east of Ambohimanga called Antsahafady, or at the sacred stone of Ambatolava in Ambohimanga village. His body was wrapped in a red lambamena shroud. Different traditions give his place of entombment as Ambohimanatrika in Ilafy, or Isoraka in Antananarivo. His daughter, who first married King Andrianamboatsimarofy of Imerinatsimo, remarried upon her first husband's death in 1796 with King Andrianampoinimerina.

Their style was heavily influenced by Americana, folk and country music. History The band was formed in 1999 after ex-Boys Life member Brandon Butler relocated from Kansas to the Washington, D.C. area and briefly fronted the band Farewell Bend. Originally playing shows under the moniker Vita Bruno, the initial Canyon lineup consisted of members from several influential DC post-hardcore bands including John Wall from Kerosene 454 and Vin Novara from the Crownhate Ruin. The band released their first LP in 2001 on John Wall's Slowdime Records and toured nationally afterwards. By the time the record was released, fellow Boys Life member Joe Winkle had arrived in D.C., prompting a lineup shift that saw the departure of Wall and Novara, along with the addition of keyboardist Derry deBorja, bassist Evan Berodt, and drummer Dave Bryson. The self-titled album was picked up and re-released by Gern Blandsten Records, who also released their second full-length, \\"Empty Rooms,\\" in 2002. Further touring ensued, including an opening slot for former Uncle Tupelo/Son Volt member Jay Farrar, and the recording of a live album for DCN Records. The Canyon song \\"Mansion on the Mountain('Live in NYC' version),\\" from \\"Empty Rooms,\\" is in the default library for Windows XP and subsequent versions of Windows. On November 19, 2010, Canyon reunited as a four-piece featuring Butler, Winkle, and a supporting rhythm section, to play at the Black Cat in Washington DC. deBorja, Berodt, and Bryson were not featured in this reunion. Connections Derry deBorja, Evan Berodt, and Dave Bryson later played with the DC-based Americana outfit Revival before deBorja and Bryson joined Son Volt as full-time members.

It was also accompanied by a scientific expedition mandated by the French Academy. After the fall of Messolonghi in 1826, the Western European powers decided to intervene in favour of revolutionary Greece. Their primary objective was to force Ibrahim Pasha, the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian ally, to evacuate the occupied regions and the Peloponnese. The intervention began when a Franco-Russo-British fleet was sent to the region and won the Battle of Navarino in October 1827, destroying the entire Turkish-Egyptian fleet. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps of 15,000 men led by General Nicolas-Joseph Maison landed in the southwestern Peloponnese. During October, soldiers took control of the principal strongholds still held by the Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France in early 1829 after an 8 month-deployment, the French kept a military presence in the area until 1833. The French army, however, suffered numerous human losses, mainly due to fever and dysentery, with around 1,500 dead. As had occurred during Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, when a Commission des Sciences et des Arts accompanied the military campaign, a scientific commission (Exp√©dition scientifique de Mor√©e) was attached to the French troops and placed under the supervision of three academies of the Institut de France. Directed by the naturalist and geographer Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent, nineteen scientists representing different specialties in natural history, archaeology and architecture-sculpture made the voyage to Greece in March 1829; most of them stayed there for 9 months. Their work proved essential to the ongoing development of the new Greek State and, more broadly, marked a major milestone in the modern history of archaeology, cartography and natural sciences, as well as in the study of Greece.Yiannis Sa√Øtas et al., L'≈ìuvre de l'exp√©dition scientifique de Mor√©e 1829-1838, Edited by Yiannis Sa√Øtas, Editions Melissa, 2011 (Part I) - 2017 (Part II).Marie- No√´lle Bourguet, Bernard Lepetit, , Maroula Sinarellis, L‚ÄôInvention scientifique de la M√©diterran√©e. √âgypte, Mor√©e, Alg√©rie., √âditions de l‚ÄôEHESS, 1998. ()  Context  =Military and diplomatic context= Delacroix, Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi. This painting played an important role in the public opinion campaign in the West that led to an intervention.alt=left In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won numerous victories early on and declared independence on 1 January 1822. However, the declaration contradicted the principles of the Congress of Vienna and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any possible change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents. The liberal and national uprising displeased Metternich, chancellor of the Austrian Empire and the principal political architect of the Holy Alliance. Russia looked favourably on the insurrection due to its Orthodox religious solidarity and its geostrategic interest (control of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus). France, another active member of the Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at Trocadero (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade. Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the situation of the region, primarily because it was on the route to India and London wished to exert there a form of control.Christopher Montague Woodhouse, The Philhellenes, London, Hodder et Stoughton, 1969, 192 p. Finally, for all of Europe, Greece represented the cradle of Western civilisation and of art since antiquity. The Greek victories had been short- lived. The Sultan had called for aid from his Egyptian vassal Muhammad Ali, who dispatched his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, and later added 25,000 troops.An Index of events in the military history of the Greek nation., Hellenic Army General Staff, Army History Directorate, Athens, 1998, pp. 51 and 54. Ibrahim's intervention proved decisive: much of the Peloponnese was reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of Messolonghi fell in 1826; and Athens was taken in 1827. The only territory still held by Greek nationalists was in Nafplion, Mani, Hydra, Spetses and Aegina.Georges Contogeorgis, Histoire de la Gr√®ce, Paris, Hatier, coll. Nations d'Europe, 1992, 477 p. A strong current of philhellenism had developed in Western Europe, especially after 1826 and the fall of Missolonghi, where the poet Lord Byron had died in 1824. Many artists and intellectuals such as Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand,Fran√ßois-Ren√© vicomte de Chateaubriand, Note sur la Gr√®ce (1826) pr√©c√©dent l‚ÄôItin√©raire de Paris √† J√©rusalem, Firmin Didot, 1852. Victor Hugo,Victor Hugo, Les Orientales, Charles Gosselin, Paris, 1829. Alexander Pushkin, Gioachino Rossini, Hector BerliozHector Berlioz, La r√©volution grecque: sc√®ne h√©ro√Øque, pour solistes, avec ou sans ch≈ìur, orchestre, H 21, text by Humbert Ferrand, 1825. or Eug√®ne Delacroix (in his paintings of The Massacre at Chios in 1824, and of Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi in 1826), amplified the current of sympathy for the Greek cause in the public opinion. The European powers eventually decided to intervene in favour of Greece‚Äîa Christian vanguard in the Orient‚Äîwhose strategic location in containing Muslim expansion was obvious to those political powers. By the Treaty of London of 6 July 1827,The text on Gallica France, Russia and the United Kingdom recognised the autonomy of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a demonstration of force was proposed and adopted; subsequently a joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exert diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. The Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) resulted in the complete destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.Christopher Montague Woodhouse, The Battle of Navarino, Hoddler and Stoughton, London, 1965.Eug√®ne Bogdanovitch, La Bataille de Navarin d'apr√®s des documents in√©dits des archives imp√©riales russes., G. Charpentier, E. Fasquelle, Paris, 1897. The Battle of Navarino, on 20 October 1827, where the Allied naval forces (Britain, France and Russia) decisively defeated the Ottoman and Egyptian fleet In 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus found himself in a difficult situation: he had just suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet enforced a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; and his Albanian troops, whom he could no longer pay, had returned to their country under the protection of Theodoros Kolokotronis' Greek troops. On 6 August 1828, a convention had been signed at Alexandria between the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, and the British admiral Edward Codrington. By its terms, Ibrahim Pasha was required to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1,200 men) remaining there, but he refused to honour the agreement and continued to control various Greek regions: Messenia, Navarino, and Patras as well as several other strongholds‚Äîand even ordered the systematic destruction of Tripolitza.Brunet de Presle, Alexandre Blanchet, La Gr√®ce, p. 555. Meanwhile, the French government of Charles X was beginning to have doubts about its Greek policy.de Presle, p. 556. Ibrahim Pasha himself noted this ambiguity when he met General Maison in September.\\"Why was France, after enslaving men in Spain in 1823, now coming to Greece to make free men?\\" in Arch de Vaulabelle, Histoire des deux Restaurations, vol. 7, p. 472. Eventually a pro-Greek liberal movement, inspired by what was then happening in Greece, began to develop in France. The longer France waited to act, the more delicate her position vis-√†-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A proposal to send a joint land expedition was made to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared war against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for Great Britain, which did not wish to see the Tsarist empire extend too far south, and compelled it to not oppose an intervention by France alone.Arch. de Vaulabelle, Histoire des deux Restaurations, vol. 7, p. 649. =Intellectual context= Enlightenment philosophy had stimulated Western Europeans' interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised ancient Greece, the linchpin of classical antiquity as it was perceived and taught in academe. Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of classical Athens. The ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works such as Abb√© Barth√©lemy's Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788) served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean. The theories and system of interpreting ancient art devised by Johann Joachim Winckelmann influenced European tastes for decades. His major work, History of Ancient Art, was published in 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation did not appear until 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works chronologically and stylistically.Alain Schnapp, La Conqu√™te du pass√©. Aux origines de l'arch√©ologie., Editions Carr√©, Paris, 1993. p. 258. The views of Winckelmann on art encompassed the entirety of civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general level of development and the evolution of its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation in terms of progress‚Äîapogee and then decline.Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique., Yale University Press, 1981, p. 104. For him, the golden age of Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement, culminating with the career of the sculptor Phidias. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful (Praxiteles) and Decadent (Roman period). The Parthenon at the time of Lord Elgin Winckelmann concluded his theory on the evolution of art with an explication of the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of political and religious liberty. His theories idealised ancient Greece and increased Europeans's desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He persuaded 18th-century Europe that life in ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of \\"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\\".Cited by Roland and Fran√ßoise Etienne, La Gr√®ce antique., Gallimard, 1990, p. 60-61. Greece became the \\"motherland of the arts\\" and \\"the teacher of taste\\".Roland and Fran√ßoise Etienne, La Gr√®ce antique., Gallimard, 1990, p. 44-45. The French government had planned the Morea expedition in the same spirit as those of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, whose work it wished to complete. The semi-scientific expeditions commissioned and financed by the Society of Dilettanti remained a benchmark: these represented the first attempts to rediscover ancient Greece. The first, that of Stuart and Revett to Athens and the islands, took place in 1751‚Äì1753, and resulted in publication of The Antiquities of Athens, a work mined by architects and designers for models of a refined \\"Grecian\\" neoclassicism. The expedition of Revett, Richard Chandler and William Pars to Asia Minor took place between 1764 and 1766. Finally, the removal by Lord Elgin of half of the surviving marble sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from other buildings, and their transport to Britain at the beginning of the 19th century, had inspired further philhellenic longing for the cultural glories of ancient Greece: it now seemed possible to build vast collections of ancient art in Western Europe.

The Chief of the General Staff was General Antoine Simon Durrieu.Alexandre Duheaume (Captain in the 58th Line Infantry Regiment), Souvenirs de la Mor√©e, pour servir √† l'histoire de l'exp√©dition fran√ßaise en 1828-1829., Anselin, Paris, 1833. Also departing were the 3rd Chasseur Regiment (1st brigade, 286 men, commanded by Colonel Paul-Eug√®ne de Faudoas-Barbazan), four companies of artillery (484 men, with 12 battery pieces for sieges, 8 for campaigns, and 12 for mountains) of the 3rd and 8th Artillery Regiments, and two companies of military engineers that included 800 sappers (combat engineers) and miners. A transport fleet protected by warships was organised; sixty ships sailed in all. Equipment, victuals, munitions and 1,300 horses had to be brought over, as well as arms, munitions and money for the Greek provisional government of Ioannis Kapodistrias.A.

With the Egyptian army ensconced between Navarino and Methoni, the landing was risky. After a two-hour meeting between General Maison and Admiral Henri de Rigny, who came to meet him aboard the Conqu√©rant, the fleet sailed toward the Messenian Gulf, whose southern entrance was protected by a fort held by the Ottomans in Koroni. The expeditionary corps reached the northwest part of the Gulf and began disembarking on the evening of 29 August with no opposition, and finished on 30‚Äì31 August. Soldiers pitched camp north of the plain of Koroni, ten minutes north of the ruins of ancient Coronea (near Petalidi), on the banks of the rivers Djane (for the General Staff), Karakasili-Karya and Velika. A proclamation by governor Ioannis Kapodistrias had informed the Greek population of the imminent arrival of a French expedition. It was said that the locals would have rushed up before the troops as soon as they set foot on Greek soil to offer them food.Arch. de Vaulabelle, p.471. However, neither Captains Duheaume (Souvenirs de la Mor√©e) and Cavaignac (Lettres), nor Dr. Roux (Histoire m√©dicale) confirm this statement. On the contrary, Duheaume asserts that on their arrival, \\"Some Greeks, attracted by the lure of gain, sell us expensive grapes, figs, watermelons, squash, and the following days, some lamb and a few chickens that improve very little our daily food.\\" The 1st brigade commanded by Tiburce S√©bastiani let the camp on 8 September for Koroni, on the heights of which it installed its camp. The 3rd brigade (2nd convoy), which had been carried by a fleet that sailed against a storm on the night of 16 September and lost three ships (including the brig Aimable Sophie which transported 22 horses of the 3rd Chasseur Regiment), managed to land at Petalidi on 22 September. On the 26th, it joined by sea the 2nd brigade, which had already moved by foot from Petalidi on 15 September and settled its camp of Djalova near Navarino. At their arrival on the Greek soil, the French found a country that had just been ravaged by Ibrahim's troops: villages razed to the ground, agricultural crops entirely burned and a population still living under a yoke of terror, starving and secluded in caves.Eug√®ne-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval (painter, member of the scientific commission), Souvenirs (1829-1830), Librairie Plon, E.

He used a number of pretexts to delay the evacuation: problems with food supply or transport, or unforeseen difficulties in handing over the strongholds. The French officers had problems maintaining the fighting zeal of their soldiers, who for example had become excited at the (false) news of an imminent march on Athens.Blouet 1838, p. xxi The impatience of the French troops was perhaps decisive in convincing the Egyptian commander to respect his obligations. Moreover, the French soldiers began to suffer from the autumnal rains that drenched the tents pitched in their camps and favoured the spread of fever and dysentery.Charles-Joseph Bastide, Consid√©rations sur les maladies qui ont r√©gn√© en Mor√©e, pendant la campagne de 1828 (Internet Archive). Thesis presented publicly and defended at the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier on 19 March 1830 by Charles-Joseph Bastide, Surgeon-Major of the 16th Line Infantry Regiment, to obtain the grade of Doctor of Medicine, imprimeur Jean Martel A√Æn√©, Montpellier, 1830. On 24 September, Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac wrote that thirty men of 400 in his company of military engineers were already affected by fever. General Maison wished to be able to set up his men in the fortresses' barracks.Arch. de Vaulabelle, p. 471. On 7 September, following a long conference aboard the ship Conqu√©rant, in the presence of General Maison and the three allied Admirals, Ibrahim Pasha accepted the evacuation of his troops as of 9 September. The agreement provided that the Egyptians would leave with their arms, baggage and horses, but without any Greek slaves or prisoners. As the Egyptian fleet could not evacuate the entire army in one operation, supplies were authorised for the troops who remained on land; these men had just endured a lengthy blockade.A. Hugo, France militaire, vol. 5, p. 317 A first Egyptian division, 5,500 men and 27 ships, set sail on September 16, escorted by three ships from the joint fleet (two English ones and the French frigate Sir√®ne). The day before, on 15 September, the French troops had moved their camp from Petalidi and had crossed the Messenian peninsula to the west in order to get closer to Navarino. They had set up their new camp north of the bay in the swampy plain of the Djalova, two leagues north of Navarino. On 1 October, General Maison reviewed the entire French troops on the shore, in the presence of Ibrahim Pasha who came without escort, and of the Greek General Nikitaras. The French printer Jacques Mangeart gave a detailed description of this review in his Souvenirs. The evacuation continued throughout the month of September and the last Egyptian transport sailed away on 5 October, taking Ibrahim Pasha. Of the 40,000 men he had brought from Egypt, he was returning with barely 21,000.Nicolas-Joseph Maison (Lieutenant- General), D√©p√™ches adress√©es au ministre de la Guerre Louis-Victor de Caux, vicomte de Blacquetot, octobre 1828, in Jacques Mangeart, Additional Chapter in the Souvenirs de la Mor√©e: recueillis pendant le s√©jour des Fran√ßais dans le P√©lopon√®se, Igonette, Paris, 1830. A few Ottoman soldiers (2,500) remained to hold the different strongholds of the Peloponnese. The next mission of the French troops was to secure them, and hand them back to an independent Greece. Strongholds taken The dispatches sent by Lieutenant-General Nicolas- Joseph Maison, Commander in chief of the Morea expedition, to the Minister of War Louis-Victor de Caux de Blacquetot offer a detailed description of the taking of the strongholds of Morea during the month of October 1828. = Navarino = The New Navarino fortress, taken by General Philippe Higonet On 6 October, the day after Ibrahim's departure, General Maison ordered General Philippe Higonet to march on Navarino. He left with the 16th Infantry Regiment, which included artillery and military engineers. Navarino's seacoast was put under siege by Admiral Henri de Rigny‚Äôs fleet and the land siege was undertaken by General Higonet's soldiers. The Turkish commander of the fort refused to surrender: \\"The Porte is at war with neither the French nor the English; we will commit no hostile act, but we will not surrender the fort\\". Whereupon the sappers were ordered to open a breach in the walls and General Higonet entered the fortress, held by 530 men who surrendered without a shot being fired, along with sixty cannon and 800,000 rounds of ammunition. The French troops settled permanently in Navarino, rebuilding its fortifications and houses and setting up a hospital and various features of local administration. = Methoni = The fortress of Methoni, taken by General Antoine-Simon Durrieu On 7 October, the 35th Line Infantry Regiment, commanded by General Antoine-Simon Durrieu, accompanied by artillery and by military engineers, appeared before Methoni, a better fortified city defended by 1,078 men and a hundred cannon, and which had food supplies for six months. Two ships of the line, the Breslaw (Captain Maillard) and (Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland) blocked the port and threatened the fortress with their cannons. The fort's commanders, the Turk Hassan Pasha and the Egyptian Ahmed Bey, made the same reply as had the commander of Navarino. Methoni's fortifications were in better condition than those of Navarino, so the sappers focused on opening the city gate, which the city's garrison did not defend. The commanders of the fort later explained that they could not surrender it without disobeying the Sultan's orders, but also recognised that it was impossible for them to resist, thus the fort had to be taken, at least symbolically, by force. The French general granted them the same surrender conditions as in Navarino. The fortress of Methoni was taken and General Maison installed his apartments there (in the former home of Ibrahim Pasha), as well as the headquarters of the Morea expedition. = Koroni = The fortress of Koroni, taken by General Tiburce S√©bastiani It was more difficult to take Koroni. General Tiburce S√©bastiani showed up there on 7 October with a part of his 1st brigade and announced the taking of the fortresses of Navarino and Methoni. The fort commander's response was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. S√©bastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain (Boutauld), a sergeant and three sappers. The other French soldiers felt insulted and their general had great difficulty in preventing them from opening fire and taking the stronghold by force. The Amphitrite, the Breslaw and the Wellesley came to assist the ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannon and guns, along with a store of victuals and munitions. The fortress was then given to the Greek troops of General Nikitaras who settled there. S√©bastiani and Nikitaras (Hippolyte Lecomte) = Patras = Patras had been controlled by Ibrahim Pasha's troops since his evacuation of the Peloponnese. The 3rd brigade commanded by General Virgile Schneider had been sent by sea to take the city, located in the north-western part of the peninsula. It landed on October 4. General Schneider gave Hadji Abdullah, Pasha of Patras and of the Castle of Morea, twenty-four hours to hand over the fort. On 5 October, when the ultimatum expired, three columns marched on the city and the artillery was deployed. The Pasha immediately signed the capitulation of Patras and of the Castle of Morea. However, the aghas who commanded the latter refused to obey their pasha, whom they considered a traitor, and announced that they would rather die in the ruins of their fortress than surrender. left However, as early as October 14, the corvette Oise had left for France, bearing son and aide-de-camp of General Maison, Captain of Staff Jean Baptiste Eug√®ne, Viscount Maison, who carried dispatches to King Charles X announcing the surrender of Navarino, Methoni, Koroni and Patras, and that only stronghold was still under the control of the Turks, the Castle of the Morea. =Siege of the Castle of the Morea= The Castle of the Morea (Kastro Moreas or Kastelli) was built by Bayezid II in 1499.Robin Barber, Blue Guide. Greece., Black, London, 1987, p.392. It is located beside the sea, 10 km north of Patras, near Rion, and next to the current Rio‚ÄìAntirrio bridge. Opposite the Castle of Rumelia on the northern coast, it guarded the entry to the Gulf of Corinth, which was nicknamed the \\"Little Dardanelles\\". upright=1.2 General Schneider negotiated with the aghas, who persisted in their refusal to surrender and even shot the general. A siege against the fortress was begun and fourteen marine and field guns, placed a little over 400 meters in front of it, reduced the artillery of the besieged to silence.A. Hugo, France militaire, vol. 5, p. 319 In Navarino, General Maison commanded General Durrieu and Admiral de Rigny to have all the artillery and sappers embark in the ships anchored in the bay. On 20 October he also sent by land General Higonet, accompanied by two infantry regiments and by the 3rd Light Cavalry Regiment of the Chasseurs. These reinforcements arrived on the evening of 26 October after an intensive week of marching with their pace set by the rhythm of the drums. New batteries nicknamed for breaching (de br√®che) were installed. These received the names \\"Charles X\\" (King of France), \\"George IV\\" (King of the United Kingdom; this attention was greeted by the British), \\"Duke of Angoul√™me\\" (son of the king and dauphin of France), \\"Duke of Bordeaux\\" (grandson of the king, and future count of Chambord) and \\"La Marine\\".Colonel Antoine-Charles-F√©lix Hecquet, who headed a battalion of the 54th infantry regiment during the Morea expedition (manuscript donated by Pr. Jack Davis), Gennadius Library: https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/news/newsDetails/notes-sur-le-siege-de-chateau-de- moree.-notes-sur-lexpedition-de-moree-en-1828 A part of the French fleet, including the Breslaw and the Conqu√©rant, and the British under Admiral Edmund Lyons came to add their cannons. Some parts of the French and British batteries were even mixed and manipulated by gunners from both nations. The Russian fleet could not take part in the siege, being stationed in Malta, but Admiral Lodewijk van Heiden had long since offered to be at the disposal of General Maison. On 30 October, early in the morning, twenty-five heavy gun batteries (including six field pieces, four howitzers, several mortars and an English bombard) opened fire. Within four hours, a large breach was opened in the ramparts. Then, an emissary came out with a white flag to negotiate the terms of the fort's surrender. General Maison replied that the terms had been negotiated at the beginning of the month at Patras. He added that he did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect a second one. He gave the garrison half an hour to evacuate the fort, without arms or baggage. The aghas surrendered, but the fortress' resistance had cost 25 men of the French expedition killed or wounded.Brunet de Presle, Alexandre Blanchet, p. 556.; A. Hugo, p. 319; and Arch de Vaulabelle, p. 474. =Military results of the expedition= left On 5 November 1828, the last Turks and Egyptians had definitely left Morea. 2,500 men and their families were placed aboard French vessels headed for Smyrna. It is therefore 26 to 27,000 men in total who were forced to leave the country and the strongholds in a few days. The capture of the Morea strongholds by the French expeditionary force had only required a month: > Our operations were successful in all aspects: we do not find military glory > there, without any doubt; but the object for which we have come, the > liberation of Greece, will have been more successful and prompt; Morea will > have been purged of its enemies. ‚Äî Lieutenant-General Nicolas-Joseph Maison The French and British ambassadors had set themselves up at Poros in September 1828 and invited Constantinople to send a diplomat there so as to conduct negotiations over the status of Greece. Because the Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences, General Maison explicitly suggested Greek Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias (on 5 October) pursuing military operations and extending them to Attica and Euboea.Ioannis Kapodistrias replied 4 days later: Letter to the General Maison, from Poros on 9 October (27 September) 1828 (p.354), in Correspondance du comte J. Capodistrias, pr√©sident de la Gr√®ce, Volume II, A. Cherbuliez et Cie., Paris, Geneva, 1839. France supported this project and had for that initially given instructions to General Maison on 27 August 1828.√âdouard Driault and Michel Lh√©ritier, Histoire diplomatique de la Gr√®ce, de 1821 √† nos jours, tome I et II, Paris, Les presses universitaires de France, 1925.Despina Themeli-Katifori, Œ§Œø ŒìŒ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ∫œå ŒïŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒ≠œÅŒøŒΩ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ± œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ†ŒµœÅŒØŒøŒ¥Œø œÑŒøœÖ ŒöŒ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒØœÉœÑœÅŒπŒ± 1828-1831 (French interest in Greece during the Capodistrian period 1828-1831), Athens, ed.

But the British Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, opposed this plan (he wanted the new Greek state to be limited only to Peloponnese), thus it was left to the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.Brunet de Presle, Alexandre Blanchet, p. 556. The Ottoman Empire could no longer depend on Egyptian troops to hold Greece. The strategic situation now resembled that existing before 1825 and the landing of Ibrahim Pasha. Then, the Greek insurgents had triumphed on all fronts. After the Morea military expedition, the regular troops of the recently established Hellenic Armed Forces, only had to face the Turkish troops in Central Greece. Livadeia, gateway to Boeotia, was conquered at the beginning of November 1828 by the commander of the Army of Eastern Greece, Demetrios Ypsilantis. A counterattack by Mahmud Pasha from Euboea was repulsed in January 1829. The commander of the Army of Western Greece, Augustinos Kapodistrias, besieged and recaptured Naupaktos in April 1829 and the symbolic town of Messolonghi in May 1829.An Index of Events in the military History of the Greek Nation, p. 65-67. Ypsilantis recaptured Thebes on 21 May 1829 and defeated 7,000 Ottomans at the Battle of Petra (a narrow passage in Boeotia between Thebes and Livadeia) on 12 September 1829. This battle was significant as it was the first time the Greeks had fought victoriously on the field of battle as a regular army. The battle of Petra was the last of the Greek War of Independence.Douglas Dakin, The Greek Struggle for Independence, 1821-1833, University of California Press, 1973, p. 268. However, it took the military victory of Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì29 and the Treaty of Adrianople, which was soon after ratified by the Treaty of Constantinople in July 1832, before the independence of Greece was recognized and guaranteed by the Great Powers. This Treaty of Constantinople thus marked the end of the Greek War of Independence. The territory of the new Kingdom of Greece, however, only extended over the regions liberated by the French and Greek troops: the Peloponnese, some islands and central Greece (the northern land border of the Kingdom was drawn along a line joining the cities of Arta and Volos). =French in the Peloponnese= The troops of the Morea Expedition, despite their disappointment at not being able to pursue their objective to liberate Greece, were gradually evacuated from January 1829 (General Higonet and General S√©bastiani). Jacques Mangeart, Dr. Gaspard Roux and the brigade in which Eug√®ne Cavaignac was serving embarked in the early days of April 1829. General Maison, following his promotion to Marshal of France on 22 February 1829 and General Durrieu, following his promotion to divisional general, did not leave until 22 May 1829;They left after receiving from Greek governor Ioannis Kapodistrias a last and brilliant homage in the name of the Greek nation: they were offered the swords of Kostas Botsaris and Georgios Karaiskakis, famous warriors of the Greek revolution, who died while fighting the Turks (in Alexandre Duheaume, Souvenirs de la Mor√©e, pour servir √† l'histoire de l'exp√©dition fran√ßaise en 1828-1829, Anselin, Paris, 1833). Captain Duheaume left on 4 August 1829. Only a single brigade, so-called \\"of occupation\\", of 5,000 men (composed of the 27th, 42nd, 54th and 58th Line Infantry Regiments stationed in Navarino, Methoni and Patras) remained in the Peloponnese under the command of General Virgile Schneider. Fresh troops were sent from France to relieve the soldiers stationed in Greece; the 57th Line Infantry Regiment landed at Navarino on 25 July 1830.Capitaine Berthemet, Historique du 57e r√©giment d'infanterie., Bordeaux, 1901, chapter 9. The regiment remained until 1833. The French troops, first commanded by General Maison (1828‚Äì1829), then by General Schneider (1829‚Äì1831) and finally by General Gu√©h√©neuc (1831‚Äì1833), did not remain idle during these nearly five years.Pigi P.

Part of the garrison is working to re-establish the citadel and the fortifications that surround it\\", in Abel Blouet, Exp√©dition de Mor√©e. Section des Beaux-Arts., vol. 1, p. 2.These fortifications [of the fortress of Navarino], not long ago, shaken, opened on all sides, and not even leaving to the one who would have wanted to defend them the honor of a beautiful despair, have been restored and strengthened first by us; a few months later, as great works were about to be finished, when a lightning from the sky came to overthrow them from top to bottom. The explosion of the gunpowder magazine on the night of [19 November 1829] cost the lives of fifty of our comrades-in-arms, and over a hundred have been horribly mutilated. in Jacques Louis Lacour, Excursions en Gr√®ce pendant l'occupation de la Mor√©e par l'arm√©e fran√ßaise en 1832-33, Arthur Bertrand, Paris, 1834 barracks were built (the \\"Maison's building\\" in Navarino's fortress, which houses nowadays the new archaeological museum of Pylos), bridges were constructed (such as those over the Pamissos River between Navarino and Kalamata), the road Navarino‚ÄìMethoni was built (the first road of independent Greece, which is still used today), hospitals (in Navarino, Modon and Patras) and health commissions were established for the Greek population (as during the plague epidemic in the mountainous villages of Kalavryta and Vrachni in December 1828, which was contained by the General Higonet). Finally, many improvements were made to the Peloponnesian cities (schools, postal services, printing companies, bridges, squares, fountains, gardens, etc.).In 1833, Jacques Louis Lacour, a military sub-intendant in the brigade of occupation wrote: \\"Ibrahim-Pasha (...) would admire no less, if he returned today to Navarino, the talents and the activity of our military engineering, by seeing 'an almost French town' unfolded in a picturesque amphitheater around the roadstead where he had left only an old hovel soon abandoned by the customs. This city, at least five years old [1828-33], has no less than two to three hundred houses of rather elegant construction, most of them multi- storey; its streets are neatly maintained; there are many shops in the European style; a well paved place, serving as a purse and promenade; a monumental fountain in the middle; rich stores, without counter ladies, it is true (men from Orient would not care); a military hospital built on the sea shore, whose only view is already a subject of rest and recreation...\\" in Jacques Louis Lacour, Excursions en Gr√®ce pendant l'occupation de la Mor√©e par l'arm√©e fran√ßaise en 1832-33, Arthur Bertrand, Paris, 1834 The military engineering commander of the Morea expedition, Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph- Victor Audoy, was commissioned by the Governor of Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias to design the first urban framework plan of the country's modern history.In the Archives of the Greek Ministry for the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works are 2 original copies of Methoni's urban plan (signed by Ioannis Kapodistrias, one of which bears a bottom note from Audoy: \\"Designed and drawn by me, lieutenant of the military engineering, Modon, 4 May 1829 - Signature - Audoy\\") and a copy of Pylos's urban plan (signed by Kapodistrias on 15 January 1831). These urban plans carry respectively the Numbers 1 and 2 of the Archives of the Ministry. Audoy built from the spring of 1829 the new cities of Modon (today Methoni) and Navarino (today Pylos) outside the walls of the fortresses, on the model of the bastides of Southwest France (from where he originated) and of the cities of the Ionian Islands (which share common features, such as a central geometrical square bordered by covered galleries built with a succession of contiguous arches, each supported by a colonnade, as the arcades of Pylos or Corfu). He also built, between December 1829 and February 1830, the famous Capodistrian School of Mutual Education (the monitorial system) of Methoni.Antonis K. Tisrigos, The Capodistrian School of Methoni (Œ§Œø Œ∫Œ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒπœÉœÑœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫œå Œ£œáŒøŒªŒµŒØŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒúŒµŒ∏œéŒΩŒ∑œÇ, 1829-2016), preface by Professor Petros Themelis, Private Edition, Athens, 2017. All these cities quickly repopulated and returned to their pre-war activity. The example of the rapid modernization of Patras, whose plans had just been drawn by the Captains of the French expedition Stamatis Voulgaris and Auguste-Th√©odore Garnot, is described at length in the Souvenirs of Jacques Mangeart, who came to the city with the Philhellene and Lieutenant-Colonel Maxime Raybaud to establish a printing company and found the Franco-Greek newspaper \\"Le Courrier d'Orient\\" in 1829. The first urban plan of Patras, designed in 1829 by Stamatis Voulgaris and Auguste-Th√©odore Garnot, Captains of the Morea expedition The Governor of Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias, when he had come to Paris in October 1827 just before his arrival in Greece, asked the French government (and in particular his friend and employee of the Ministry of War, Count Nicolas de Loverdo) for advisers and French army officers to organise the army of the new Greek state. Consequently, on the recommendation of the French Ministry of War, the Captains of the General Staff Stamatis Voulgaris (a French officer of Greek origin and friend of Kapodistrias from childhood), of the military engineering Auguste-Th√©odore Garnot, of the artillery Jean-Henri-Pierre- Augustin Pauzi√©-Banne and of the topographic service Pierre Peytier, were sent to Greece in 1828, a few months before the arrival of the Morea military expedition, to which they were attached, in order to train young Greek military engineers. Captains Voulgaris and Garnot designed the urban plans of several Greek cities: Tripolitza, Corinth (which Garnot continued alone), Nafplio (Voulgaris reworked its urban plan and that of the refugee district Pronia) and Patras. Garnot was also commissioned by Kapodistrias to found the first military engineering corps in 1828, called the Corps of Fortification and Architecture Officers,By the decree of 28 July 1829. History of the Hellenic Military Engineering, Hellenic Army General Staff . whose mission was to build, maintain and improve fortifications, military and civilian buildings, bridges, roads and other constructions. The Captain of artillery Pauzi√© was responsible for founding the School of Artillery and then the Hellenic Central Military Academy, commonly known as the \\"Evelpidon School\\" in 1828,By the decree 8683 of 12 January 1829, signed by Greek Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias and by Henri Pauzi√© (ŒîŒπŒ¨œÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± Œ†ŒµœÅŒØ ŒüœÅŒ≥Œ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºŒøœç Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπœâœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒöŒµŒΩœÑœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ£œáŒøŒªŒÆœÇ). on the model of the French √âcole Polytechnique. Finally, the map of the new Greek state was established by the Captain and engineer- geographer Pierre Peytier in 1832. At the same time, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Morea Expedition, Colonel Camille Alphonse Tr√©zel was promoted by Ioannis Kapodistrias, General and Commander of the regular army in 1829.By the decree 56 of 22 July 1829 (ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒØœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ, Œ±œÅ. 56, 22 ŒôŒøœÖŒªŒØŒøœÖ 1829) Composed at that time of 2,688 men, General Tr√©zel organized it \\"√† la fran√ßaise\\",Anastasia Tsagkaraki, Les philhell√®nes fran√ßais dans la lutte pour l‚Äôind√©pendance grecque (1821-1831), Revue Historique des Arm√©es, 2nd trimester 2016. both for its administration and for its jurisdiction, for the training and for the advancement of the soldiers, and even for its uniforms which were the same than those of the French.See the iconography of the different types of French uniforms of Officers and Soldiers of the regular Hellenic Army in 1829, on the website of the Hellenic Army General Staff . In November 1829, General Tr√©zel was replaced by General G√©rard, who remained Commander of the regular Army until 1831. Finally, Governor Kapodistrias also commissioned in 1829 the geologist of the expedition Pierre Th√©odore Virlet d'Aoust to assess the possibility of digging a canal on the Isthmus of Corinth. Thus, from the first years of its independence, Greece established lasting military cooperation with France, who is still considered today as its traditional strategic ally.History of the Hellenic Army, on the website of the Hellenic Army General Staff . To all these achievements made by the French military troops, the scientific work realised by the scientific commission of the Morea between the months of March and December 1829 should be added as well. The French troops definitively withdrew from Greece in August 1833, shortly after the arrival of King Otto of Greece and the Bavarian Auxiliary Corps, in the previous January. They were then replaced by the corps of the Royal Army composed of 3,500 Bavarian soldiers and officers. = Human cost of the expedition = Marshal Maison, General Fabvier, Admiral de Rigny, and the French marines & soldiers who died for the Hellenic independence, homeland and freedom\\" (gray marble obelisk on Filellinon square in Nafplio) Despite the brevity of the military operations and the small number of battles, the human cost of the French expedition was extremely heavy: between 1 September 1828 and 1 April 1829, the Chief Medical Officer of the expeditionary corps, Dr. Gaspard Roux, officially reported 4,766 illnesses and 1,000 deaths915 dead reported by Dr. Roux in the hospitals of Navarino, Methoni, Koroni and Patras. He estimated that this number actually amounted to 1,000, taking into account the deaths of patients and convalescents repatriated to France in 1829. Roux thus estimated the mortality rate at about 18 percent. (In Dr. Gaspard Roux, the chief medical officer of the expedition), Histoire m√©dicale de l'arm√©e fran√ßaise en Mor√©e, pendant la campagne de 1828, M√©quignon l'a√Æn√© p√®re, Paris, 1829. (numbers confirmed by Doctor Charles-Joseph Bastide, Surgeon-Major of the 16th Line Infantry Regiment). Thus, almost a third of French troops were affected by fevers, diarrhea and dysentery, which had been mostly contracted between October and December 1828 in the camps established within the marshy plains of Petalidi, in the mouth of the river Djalova (in Navarino Bay) or in Patras. This epidemic of fever, characterized by a large majority of tertian fevers (occurring every two days), periodic, with a high rate of relapse, dazzling and accompanied by shivering, jaundice, convulsions, headache and neurological and digestive disorders, certainly corresponds to malaria (word that originates from medieval Italian: mala aria‚Äî\\"bad air\\"; the disease was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland) which was endemic to the region at that time (it was definitively eradicated in Greece in 1974).On the website of the Greek National Public Health Organization: https://eody.gov.gr/en/disease/malaria/ The epidemic began during the warm season, on 20 September 1828, marked its peak on 20 October (15 November in Patras), then subsided during the month of November, to completely stop in December 1828. Memorial monument dedicated to the memory of the French soldiers and officers of the Morea expedition who died of malaria in GialovaAlthough Doctor Roux recognized the main and deleterious influence of swamps in the spread of the disease, it was not until 1880 that its primary cause, the Plasmodium parasite (a single-celled microorganism), was discovered by the Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran‚Äîa French army doctor working in the military hospital of Constantine in Algeria‚Äî who observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time (Nobel Prize in 1907).Biography of Alphonse Laveran, in The Nobel Foundation. Also, the evidence that female Anopheles mosquitoes, which neither Doctor Roux nor Doctor Bastide ever mention, are the vectors of malaria, came only in 1897 by the Scottish physician Sir Ronald Ross (Nobel Prize in 1902).Biography of Sir Ronald Ross, in The Nobel Foundation. The doctors attributed the disease mainly to the proximity of the focal point of infection in lowlands and marshy places and to the harshness of the transitions in temperatures between day and night, and to a lesser extent, to the intensity of the multiple and arduous works, as well as in the excessive consumption of salted meat, of spirits, and of the muddy and brackish water of the region. The cooler weather of winter, the moving of the men into the fortresses's barracks, the immediate enforcement of strict hygiene and sanitation measures, the arrival of drugs from France, as well as the establishment of three military hospitals in Navarino, Methoni and Patras significantly reduced this loss of life. It should also be noted that the use by Doctor Roux of antipyretic febrifuges such as cinchona powder and quinine, purified for the first time only 8 years before, in 1820, by Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaim√© Caventou,Kyle R, Shampe M (1974). \\"Discoverers of quinine\\". Journal of the American Medical Association 229 (4): 462. doi:10.1001/jama.229.4.462. . resulted in most convincing therapeutic results. However, the total number of deaths would increase significantly thereafter until the expedition's departure in 1833, especially following some suicides, duels, a few cases of \\"narcotism\\" following an overuse of alcoholic liquors, with the explosion of a gunpowder magazine within the fort of Navarino, which cost the lives of fifty soldiers on 19 November 1829, and following the Argos affair on January 16, 1833, which resulted in the death of three French soldiers. The scientific mission will also be strongly affected by malaria fever during the next summer in 1829. The total number of deaths in the Morea expedition is generally estimated, according to testimonies, at around 1,500.Edgar Quinet (historian, member of the scientific commission), De la Gr√®ce moderne, et de ses rapports avec l‚Äôantiquit√©, F.-G. Levrault, Paris, 1830.'' Subsequently, memorials commemorating these fallen French soldiers were erected by the Greek and French states on the islet of Sphacteria in Navarino's bay (monument erected in May 1890)Law ŒëŒ©ŒöŒòŒÑ of May 1890 \\"on the free concession to the French government of a national space, etc., for the burial of the French soldiers and sailors who fell during the naval battle of Neokastro [battle of Navarino] and the campaign of Peloponnese [Morea expedition]\\". Thus, according to the Official Journal, number 115 of 23 May 1890: \\"By unanimous vote of the Parliament, is decided and ordered: Article 1.

Scientific expedition Abel Blouet = Establishment of the scientific mission = The Morea expedition was the second of the great military-scientific expeditions led by France in the first half of the 19th century. The first, used as a benchmark, had been the Egyptian one, starting in 1798 (Commission des sciences et des arts); the last took place in Algeria from 1839 (Commission d'exploration scientifique d'Alg√©rie). All three took place at the initiative of the French government and were placed under the guidance of a particular ministry (Foreign relations for Egypt, Interior for Morea and War for Algeria). The great scientific institutions were recruiting scholars (both civilians and from the military) and were specifying their missions, but in situ work was done in close cooperation with the army.Bernard Lepetit, \\"Missions scientifiques et exp√©ditions militaires : remarques sur leurs modalit√©s d‚Äôarticulation.\\", in L‚ÄôInvention scientifique de la M√©diterran√©e., p. 97. The Commission of Sciences and Arts during Napoleon‚Äôs campaign in Egypt, and especially the publications that followed, had become a model. Since Greece was the other important region of antiquity considered the origin of Western civilisation (one of the philhellenes' principal arguments), it was decided, as mentioned by Abel Blouet, to: > ...take advantage of the presence of our soldiers who were occupying Morea > to send a scholarly commission. It did not have to equal that attached to > the glory of Napoleon [‚Ä¶] It did however need to render eminent services to > the arts and sciences. The Interior minister of King Charles X, the power behind the throne and real head of the government at the time, the Viscount of Martignac, charged six academicians of the Institut de France (Acad√©mie des Sciences: Georges Cuvier and √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles- lettres: Charles-Beno√Æt Hase and Desir√©-Raoul Rochette. Acad√©mie des Beaux- arts: Jean-Nicolas Hyot and Jean-Antoine Letronne) to appoint the chief- officers and members of each section of the Scientific Committee. Jean- Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent was thus appointed director of the commission on December 9, 1828.Moreover, Bory de Saint-Vincent was a childhood friend of Martignac in Bordeaux at the time of the French revolution. They also determined the routes and objectives.Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent, Relation de l'Exp√©dition scientifique de Mor√©e: Section des sciences physiques, F.-G.

De Martignac and Sim√©on had asked me expressly not to restrict my > observations to Flies and Herbs, but to extend them to places and to men The expedition, composed of nineteen scientists, was divided into three sections (Physical Sciences, Archaeology, Architecture-Sculpture), each placed under the direction of Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent (Physical Sciences section), L√©on-Jean-Joseph Dubois (Archaeology section) and Guillaume-Abel Blouet (Architecture and Sculpture section). The painter Amaury-Duval gave portraits of these three directors in his Souvenirs (1829-1830) written in 1885.\\"Mr. Dubois, head of the Archaeology section, in which I was a designer, had been a student of David. I would readily believe that his dispositions for painting were not great enough for him to continue to follow this career; the fact remains that he renounced it and became, I do not know by what circumstances, friend and assistant of the great Champollion. He had exercised his eye in many expertises, had probably gleaned a little to the right and to the left, especially in the conversation of his master, who made him obtain, at the Louvre Museum, a fairly important place. Tall, fat, lively, cheerful, an appearance of Joseph Prudhomme, with whom gold glasses gave him even more resemblance. His repertoire of workshop charges, although varied, was not inexhaustible, however; the jokes and the stories he told in a funny way, repeated themselves a little; some dated from the time of the Empire, but I did not know them, and they amused me. He was married and lived in Paris, with his wife and young daughter, in a modest but comfortable interior; during our excursion, I often heard him regret this family life, without ever having wanted to go deeper into what he regretted the most, because it was especially during our meals that he complained. What I have to add is that at first glance he was very attractive, and that he made a lot of expenses, especially for the latest arrivals [...]The brilliant mind of Mr. Bory Saint-Vincent could not get me, as young as I was, to overcome his arrogance and his aplomb, and I got used with difficulty to this activity, to this perpetual movement. His clothing, in the ceremonies or in the visits that we were going to pay to the authorities, was of a grotesque completion. He had combined in a very bizarre mixture the costume of a colonel and that of a member of the Institute. But he was not aware, or pretended not to notice, the amazement he caused everywhere. From the first days, he let his ambition, which he did not stop having during the trip, to pass for the supreme head of the commission, and I quickly noticed the coldness that Mr. Blouet and Mr. Dubois testified to him when he let his pretensions appear too much. As an indifferent spectator of this little antagonism, I could easily foresee how much the results of the expedition would suffer from that. I am probably mistaken; but I find difficult to understand a commission of this nature without a single chief, who directs the whole and who assumes all the responsibility. There were at our head three chiefs: they were already too many, and who were intended, and soon, to each pull their own side... It is true that there are many other circumstances for which I do admit only one master. Therefore, I repeat, I am probably wrong. Mr. Blouet, a talented architect, had the serious appearance of a hard worker. But the two most curious types of the commission were, without question, Edgar Quinet and Vietty, sculptor from Lyon... \\", Eug√®ne- Emmanuel Amaury-Duval, Souvenirs (1829-1830), Chapter III , Librairie Plon, E.

View of Navarino and its Bay shortly after the arrival of the scientific commission in Greece (by Prosper Baccuet) The members of the scientific expedition embarked on February 10, 1829 in Toulon aboard the frigate Cyb√®le (commanded by the frigate captain, de Robillard) and, after 21 days of a rather tumultuous crossing of the Mediterranean for the members of the expedition,\\"The beginning of the dinner, very well served, passed happily. We had known our officers for some time; but perhaps their cheerfulness came from the scene they were about to see. The wind, it seems, had risen at the end of the harbor [of Toulon], and the ship was rolling quite hard. The moment for soup passed regularly; but suddenly deep silence. My gaze fixed on a point from which nothing in the world could have detached them, my comrades paled visibly; you could see the sweat beading on their foreheads. One of them could not stand it any longer, rose hastily, and, in his flight, clashed with the beams of the very low ceiling; but nothing stopped him. A second followed him; soon the rout became general. The officers, who barely concealed their desire to laugh, all turned their eyes to my side and waited ..., but in vain! Alone, I did not move, devouring what I had on my plate, and my face as calm, as joyful as if I had been on the ground, sitting at a good table. All the officers, then, filling their glasses, began to scream three Hurray! and drank to the health of the young scientist. After dinner, I went up on deck, and saw the dreadful spectacle of all my inanimate companions [...] These were for me impressions that my poor companions, almost always sick and often bedridden, could not experience.\\", Eug√®ne-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval (painter, member of the scientific commission), Souvenirs (1829-1830), Chapter IV, Librairie Plon, E.

While in Egypt and Algeria, scientific work was done under the army's protection, in Morea, while scientific exploration had barely begun, the first troops already started embarking for France from the first days of April 1829. The army merely provided logistical support: tents, stakes, tools, liquid containers, large pots and sacks; in a word, everything that could be found for us to use in the army's storehouses.Bory de Saint-Vincent, Relation du voyage de la Commission scientifique de Mor√©e., vol 1, p. 114, in Bernard Lepetit, cited article, p. 100. Shortly after the arrival of the scientific commission in Greece and its installation in its headquarters in Modon, the governor of the First Hellenic Republic Ioannis Kapodistrias came to meet its members on April 11, 1829. He already had the opportunity to meet on his way, between Argos and Tripolizza, Edgar Quinet who had then already parted from the rest of the commission and was heading to Argolida. The historian and future French politician presents on this occasion portraits of the president and his aides-de-camp, the heroes of Greek independence Kolokotronis and Nikitaras, who all left strong impression on him. The president also met Abel Blouet a little further on his journey, in the vicinity of Corone.Abel Boulet, Expedition scientifique de Mor√©e ordonn√©e par le Gouvernement Fran√ßais ; Architecture, Sculptures, Inscriptions et Vues du P√©lopon√®se, des Cyclades et de l'Attique (Volume I, 1831) Abel Boulet, Amable Ravoisi√©, Achille Poirot, F√©lix Tr√©zel et Fr√©d√©ric de Gournay, Firmin Didot, Paris. A great dinner was organised at Modon, which brought together for the last time before the expeditionary force returned to France: President Kapodistrias, Marshal Maison, the Greek and French officers and principal chiefs (Kolokotronis, Nikitaras, Makriyannis, Kallergis, Fabvier, etc.), and all members of the scientific commission. Bory de Saint-Vincent introduced the members of his section to the president, then both had the opportunity to discuss at length questions of international diplomacy. They met again later in Argos, Nafplion and Aegina. The painter Amaury-Duval, also noted the special devotion of the Greek President to his project to develop schools of mutual education (the monitorial system) in the country. In general, texts describing the multiple meetings between the members of the scientific commission and the Greek president invariably show reciprocal respect and mutual esteem.

Geography and Geology The Map of the Morea of 1832 (by Captain Pierre Peytier), the first map of the Greek territory ever drawn scientifically and according to geodetic principles One of the first objectives fixed by the French government had been to draw precise maps of the Peloponnese, with a scientific purpose, but also for economic and military reasons. The Minister of War, the Vicomte de Caux, had written to General Maison on January 6, 1829: All the maps of Greece are very imperfect and were drawn up based on more or less inaccurate templates; it is thus essential to fix them. Not only will geography be enriched by this research, but we will in the process support France's commercial interests by making her relations easier, and it will above all be useful for our ground and naval forces, who may find themselves involved in this part of Europe.Bory de Saint-Vincent, Exp√©dition scientifique de Mor√©e.

The only maps available at the time were those made by Jean-Denis Barbi√© du Bocage (1808, in 1:500,000 scale), whose map was relatively imperfect, and that of Pierre Lapie (1826, in 1:400,000 scale), which was more exact for a detailed layout and was used by the members of the expedition.Michel Sivignon, Universit√© Paris X - Nanterre, Les enseignements de la carte de Gr√®ce √† l‚Äô√©chelle de 1/200.000 (publi√©e en 1852) (Pergamos - Digital Library of the University of Athens (UoA)).

E. Livieratos 2009, Cartographic adventures of Greece 1821-1919, Athens: MIET/ELIA; p. 287, () Captain Pierre Peytier, of the topographic service in the French army, had already been invited to Greece by Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias when the latter had come to Paris in October 1827 to ask the French government for advisers and French army officers to organise the army of the new Greek state. Kapodistrias also requested the fixing of the map of Greece. Consequently, on the recommendation of the French Ministry of War, Peytier and three other officers were sent to Greece in May 1828, four months before the Morea military expedition, to train young Greek topographical engineers (including the urban engineer Stamatis Voulgaris, a staff captain in the French army, but of Greek origin). Peytier himself was to draw the plans for the city of Corinth and the map of the Peloponnese. When the scientific expedition of the Morea landed at Navarino in the Peloponnese on March 3, 1829, Peytier was attached to it. Trigonometry of the Morea (by Peytier, Puillon Boblaye and Servier) As soon as March, a base of 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one point at the ruins of Tiryns to a point at a ruined house in the village of Aria.\\"Notice sur les op√©rations g√©od√©siques ex√©cut√©es en Mor√©e, en 1829 et 1830, par MM. Pierre Peytier, Puillon-Boblaye et Servier\\" in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie, vol. 19, nr. 117-122, January ‚Äì June 1833, p. 91. This was intended to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodetic readings in the Peloponnese. Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers.\\"Notice‚Ä¶\\", Peytier et al., p. 95. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds.‚ÄùNotice‚Ä¶‚Äù, Peytier et al., p. 98. One hundred thirty four geodetic stations were set up on the peninsula's mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20 km were drawn, while the angles were measured with Gambey's theodolites.\\"Notice‚Ä¶\\", Peytier et al., p. 89. However, after the departure of the scientific mission from Greece, and although he fell ill with fever five times, Peytier remained there alone until 31 July 1831 to complete the trigonometric, topographic and statistical work for the establishment of the map of the Morea. The Map of 1832, very precisely drawn at a 1:200,000 scale on 6 sheets (plus two sheets depicting some of the islands of the Cyclades), was the first map of the Greek territory ever made according to scientifically and geodetic principles. The Map of the Kingdom of Greece of 1852 (by Captain Pierre Peytier) After the assassination of Kapodistrias in October 1831, Peytier's activity was almost completely hampered by the civil war which tore the country apart. King Otto I of Greece, who arrived in January 1833, requested of France that the topographic brigade be responsible for surveying the map of the whole kingdom. Peytier returned to Greece on 28 March 1833 and remained there until March 1836 to direct most of the work for the preparation of the complete map. Some topographic engineers remained until 1849 under the direction of Captain Soitoux for additional reconnaissance. This Map of 1852, also in 1:200,000 scale, was definitively published under Peytier's direction in 1852. Until the publication by the Geographical Service of the Hellenic Army after 1945 of the current map in 1:50,000 scale, this map from 1852 remained the only one which covered the entire territory of Greece. The French geographer and Greek specialist, Michel Sivignion indicates that the map depicts, for the first time, an exact rendering of the topography, of the layout of the rivers, of the height of the mountains, and also of the distribution of inhabited places and of the size of their populations. Beyond this technical aspect, it marks the political territory of independent Greece, its official representation, and its being taking possession of by the authorities of the territory, the limits of which are fixed. Greek chieftain (by Pierre Peytier) Peytier also left an album which he himself composed with his pencil drawings, sepias and watercolours depicting city views, monuments, costumes and inhabitants of Greece at the time. He used an artistic style that avoided idealization for the benefit of scientific fidelity and precision, which fully revealed the topographer that he was.Pierre Peytier, The Peytier Album, Liberated Greece and the Morea Scientific Expedition, in the Stephen Vagliano Collection, Published by the National Bank of Greece, Athens, 1971. The Governor of Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias also commissioned Pierre Th√©odore Virlet d'Aoust to assess the possibility of digging a canal on the isthmus of Corinth,Pierre Th√©odore Virlet d'Aoust, Percement de l'isthme de Corinthe, p. 408-421, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie, 1881, volume 2. to save ships the journey around the Peloponnese and the dangerous pass of the capes Maleas and Matapan (Tainaron) south of the peninsula. Virlet d'Aoust gave him an estimate of the project, which, without taking into account interest on its financing, was assessed to around 40 million gold francs of the time. This expense, too considerable for the Hellenic government alone, led him to give up the initiation of the works. Although the project was never carried out, Virlet still oprovided the Greek government its potential route, which followed that established by the Romans between Loutraki and Kalamaki, and which was indicated on the Geological Map in 1:200,000 scale of the scientific expedition. It was not until 1893 that the Corinth Canal was finally opened. Botany and Zoology Nepeta argolica Bory & Chaub) Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent led the Morea scientific expedition, and made detailed botanical observations.Published in Volume III: Second Part: Botany (1832) Fauch√©, Adolphe Brongniart, Chaubard, Bory de Saint-VincentThe botanic plates are also found in the Atlas (1835): Relation (Cartes & Vues de Paysages), G√©ologie (Coupes & Roches), Zoologie (Vert√©br√©s & Invert√©br√©s), Botanique. He gathered a multitude of specimens: Flore de Mor√©e (1832) lists 1,550 plants, of which 33 were orchids and 91 were grasses (just 42 species had not yet been described); Nouvelle Flore du P√©loponn√®se et des Cyclades (1838) described 1,821 species.Jean-Marc Drouin, ‚ÄúBory de Saint-Vincent et la g√©ographie botanique.‚Äù in L‚Äôinvention scientifique de la M√©diterran√©e, p. 144. In Morea, Bory de Saint-Vincent limited himself to collecting only the plants. He proceeded to their classification, identification and description upon his return to the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris. He was then helped, not by his collaborators from Greece, but by the eminent botanists of his time, Louis Athanase Chaubard, Jean-Baptiste Fauch√© and Adolphe-Th√©odore Brongniart.Drouin, p. 145. Similarly, the well-known naturalists √âtienne and his son Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire helped him to write and edit the expedition's scientific works, under the supervision of Georges Cuvier at the institute. As the gathering process went along, they sent the plants, as well as birds and fish, to France.Nouvelles annales des voyages, de la g√©ographie et de l‚Äôhistoire ou Recueil des relations originales in√©dites, July ‚Äì August ‚Äì September 1829, p. 378. jackal of the Morea (Canis aureus moreoticus) described for the first time by the Morea Expedition (Lithographs by Jean- Gabriel Pr√™tre, published by Bory de Saint-Vincent) In zoological matters, relatively few new species were described. However, the Morea expedition identified for the first time the species of jackal, Canis aureus, or golden jackal, that populates the region. Although earlier travel narratives had mentioned its presence, these were not considered trustworthy. Moreover, the subspecies described by the Morea Expedition was endemic to the region: Bory de Saint-Vincent gave it the name of the Morea (Canis aureus moreoticus) and brought back to the Museum of Natural History in Paris some pelts and a skull.Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire & √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1836), Exp√©dition scientifique de Mor√©e, volume III, 1st part, Levrault, pp. 19-27 Bory was accompanied during his explorations of the Peloponnese by the zoologists Gabriel Bibron, Sextius Delaunay and Antoine Vincent Pector, by the entomologist Gaspard-Auguste Brull√©, by the conchologist, malacologist and geologist G√©rard Paul Deshayes, by the geologists Pierre Th√©odore Virlet d‚ÄôAoust and √âmile Puillon Boblaye, and by the botanist specialist of cryptogams, lichens, fungi and algae, Louis Despreaux Saint-Sauveur. The painter Prosper Baccuet, also accompanying Bory, made illustrations of the landscapes visited that were published in Bory's Relation de l'Exp√©dition scientifique de Mor√©e (1836) and Atlas (1835). =Archaeology section= This section, supervised at the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres by Charles-Beno√Æt Hase and Desir√©-Raoul Rochette, was composed of the archaeologists L√©on-Jean-Joseph Dubois (director) and Charles Lenormant (assistant-director), by the historian Edgar Quinet and by the painters Eug√®ne-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval and Pierre F√©lix Tr√©zel. The Greek writer and linguist Michel Schinas accompanied them. Its mission was to locate eighty ancient sites (in Achaia, Arcadia, Elis and Messinia) using descriptions in ancient literature. Its itinerary followed that of Pausanias the Periegete. The sites had to be precisely located by precise triangulation, then, with the help of the architectural section, the archaeology section had to make the plans (general and by building), to draw and cast the buildings and their decorations, and to start excavations to clear buildings and antiquities. Byzantine monasteries had been added to the itinerary, and the section was tasked with attempting to buy some manuscripts from them. Olympia in 1829 as seen by the Morea expedition The archaeology section, however, did not succeed in achieving the ambitious program originally set. Its members suffered from numerous diseases and fevers and began quarreling. Charles Lenormant, for instance, when he learned that he was under the orders of Dubois, or at least that he was going to go along with him, did not think he should accept this position with a man who was his subordinate at the Louvre (he was just returning from the Egyptian archaeological expedition organised by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion in 1828); consequently he made the trip as an amateur and alone. Edgar Quinet, the prominent French historian, intellectual and politician, who did not care to be a subordinate nor for collaborating on a book‚Äîhe already intended to publish one by himself‚Äîtold Dubois that he did not have to count on him, and that he would go alone. Quinet visited Piraeus on 21 April 1829, thence reaching Athens. He saw the Cyclades in May, starting with Syros. Being sick, he returned to France on 5 June, and his Gr√®ce moderne et ses rapports avec l‚ÄôAntiquit√© was published in September 1831.Herv√© Duch√™ne, Le Voyage en Gr√®ce., Bouquins, Robert Laffont, 2003, , p. 557.

I therefore postponed the study I had made of this so interesting part of the old story.\\" Jean-Baptiste Vietty, Carnet 12, p.38. in St√©phane Gioanni, Jean-Baptiste Vietty et l'Exp√©dition de Mor√©e (1829). √Ä propos de deux manuscrits retrouv√©s , Journal des Savants, De Boccard, 2008, 2 (1), pp.383 - 429. also separated from his companions after he arrived in Greece and travelled through the Peloponnese separately. He pursued his research in Greece under extremely difficult material conditions until August 1831, long after the expedition had returned to France at the end of 1829.

But the two most curious types of the commission were, without question, Edgar Quinet and Vietty, sculptor from Lyon. [...] The sculptor, a sort of peasant of the Danube, for the form at least, was said to have a deep education: he knew Greek as much as a man from France; so he treated the inhabitants of the Morea like donkeys, because they did not understand the language of Homer: finally, more Hellenist than sculptor.\\" and p. 103: \\"Did he intend to teach the language of Homer to modern Greeks? Perhaps, because we were told later that, willing to enter a closed city by force, he had addressed in Greek to the sentry a speech so little understood, especially with French pronunciation, that, to end it, we had driven to the police station. The fact remains that he left us, and that I never saw him again.\\" Indeed, Vietty died soon after in France in 1842, in great poverty and without having published a single page of her research in the Morea (according to the testimony of geologist Virlet d'Aoust in a letter to the ministry in 1843, see previous note on St√©phane Gioanni's study). As for Edgar Quinet when he left the commission (p. 104, Chapter VII): \\"Mounted on a donkey that was partly hiding his huge coat, he was wearing a huge woman's straw hat, the edges of which, lifted by the wind, let see a pink silk ribbon tied under the neck and floating on his chest. On both sides of the saddle were attached species of baskets filled with books; behind, the guide and a horse loaded with the rest of the luggage. He passed thus in the middle of the crowd, without noticing the effect it produced, and without suspecting that it was going to be an extended theme for the officers' conversations and lazzi.\\" Eug√®ne-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval, Souvenirs (1829-1830), Librairie Plon, E. Plon, Nourrit et Cie, printer-publishers, Paris, 1885. Thus, the members of this section each left in different directions, with Dubois failing to impose his authority and to prevent them doing so, a fact that elicited rather sarcastic comments from Baron Georges Cuvier, the Commissioner of the Academie who was supervising the \\"competing\\" Physical Sciences section.A letter from Cuvier, dated 15 April 1829 reads: \\"My section is still compact and working. Unfortunately it is not the same in that of archaeology. Mr. Lenormant, who just arrived from Egypt, found himself (at 25) humiliated to be under the orders of Mr. Dubois (who is 50) and declared that he was on his own, in order to be able to correspond with the [journal, The] Globe. A Mr. Schinas, a Greek, and a Mr. Quinet, a philosopher (whom I believe crazy) left on their side, so that this poor Mr. Dubois remains almost alone with a painter (Tr√©zel) who has precisely become blind when arriving and the young Amaury- Duval. The architecture section also has a sort of madman, named Vietty, who runs alone without anyone knowing what he's doing.\\" (in Edgar Quinet, Journal de Voyage, notes compl√©mentaires, n. 118, p. 290-291). Their results will never be published. The main archaeological work was performed then by the Architecture and Sculpture section, which the remaining members of the Archaeology section joined. =Architecture and Sculpture section= This section had been established at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-arts by Jean-Nicolas Hyot and Jean-Antoine Letronne, who designated the architect Guillaume-Abel Blouet as its head. To assist him, the Institut had also sent the archaeologist Amable Ravoisi√© and the painters Fr√©d√©ric de Gournay and Pierre Achille Poirot. The archaeologist L√©on-Jean-Joseph Dubois and the painters Pierre F√©lix Tr√©zel and Amaury-Duval joined them after the dispersion of the archaeology section. Elevation of the Heroon at the stadium of ancient Messene (reconstruction by Guillaume-Abel Blouet) The architect Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave very precise instructions to this section. Possessed of a wide-ranging experience formed in Italy, Greece, Egypt and the Middle East, and under the influence of engineers, he asked them to keep an authentic diary of their excavations where precise measurements read off watches and compasses should be written down, to draw a map of the region they travelled, and to describe the layout of the terrain.Bernard Lepetit, cited article, p. 112. Itineraries The publication of the works on archaeology and art followed the same pattern as with the publication of the works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes, and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Exp√©dition de Mor√©e. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp. 1‚Äì7Exp√©dition de Mor√©e.

Methoni The Arcadian Gate in ancient Messene in the ‚Äúshepherd of Arcadia‚Äù style and influenced by Hubert Robert The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the \\"norm\\" that Hubert Robert had proposed for the depictions of Greece. The presence of the troops from the expeditionary corps was important, alternating with that of the Greek shepherds: \\"[...] their generous hospitality and simple and innocent manners reminded us of the beautiful period of pastoral life which fiction calls the Golden age, and which seemed to offer the real characters of the Theocritus' and Virgil's eclogues.\\" Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 25 The archaeological expedition travelled through Navarino (Pylos), Methoni, Koroni, Messene and Olympia (described in the publication's first volume); Bassae, Megalopolis, Sparta, Mantineia, Argos, Mycenae, Tiryns and Nafplion (subjects of the second volume); the Cyclades (Syros, Kea, Mykonos, Delos, Naxos and Milos), Sounion, Aegina, Epidaurus, Troezen, Nemea, Corinth, Sicyon, Patras, Elis, Kalamata, the Mani Peninsula, Cape Matapan, Monemvasia, Athens, Salamis Island and Eleusis (covered in volume III).  Methods of exploration and identification of Ancient Pylos  The artistic and archaeological exploration of the Peloponnese unfolded in the manner in which archaeological research was then conducted in Greece. The first step always involved an attempt to make an on-site check (a form of autopsy in the manner of Herodotus) against the texts of ancient authors like Homer, Pausanias or Strabo. Thus, at Cape Coryphasium near Navarino (Paleokastro, Old Navarino or Zonchio), the location of the city of the Homeric King Nestor, the famous Pylos, was determined for the first time from the adjectives \\"inaccessible\\" and \\"sandy\\" (·º†ŒºŒ±Œ∏œåŒµŒπœÇ) used in the Iliad and the Odyssey (the palace of Nestor, located higher up in the land, was not discovered until 1939 by the American archaeologist Carl Blegen). Blouet added: \\"These Hellenic constructions, which no modern traveller had yet mentioned, and which I had noticed in a previous visit, were for us an important discovery and a very- plausible reason to convince us that we saw the Pylos of Messinia.\\"Blouet, 1831, v. I, pp. 5-6 Similarly, a little further, he says about the city of Modon (Methoni), the Homeric city of Pedasus: \\"the ancient remains of the port, whose description agrees perfectly with that of Pausanias, are sufficient to determine with certainty the location of the ancient city.\\"Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 12.  First archaeological excavations of the Ancient Messene  Having explored Navarino, Methoni and Koroni, the members of the section went to the ancient city of Messene (founded in 369 BC by the Theban general Epaminondas after his victory over Sparta at Leuctra), located on the slopes of Mounts Ithome and Eva. They spent a full month there from April 10, 1829, where they were warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of the village of Mavrommati. They were the first archaeologists to carry out scientific excavations on this site of classical Greece.\\"During the month that we spent at Messene, I requested some rather considerable excavations, the results of which were not without importance for our work\\". in Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 12 They found there the famous fortified and crenelated surrounding walls of Epaminondas in a perfect state of preservation. There were two monumental portals in the wall, one of which, having a lintel or architrave of an extraordinary 6 meters in length, was described by Blouet as \\"perhaps the most beautiful in all of Greece\\".Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 40. This enclosure initially allowed them to delimit the site and to \\"give a general plan of Messene with the most meticulous and precise topographic details.\\" Then, they proceeded to the proper excavation of the archaeological site. They unearthed for the first time many fragments of stadium bleachers, drum sections and capitals of columns, porticoes, altars, bas-reliefs, sculptures and inscriptions (noted by Charles Lenormant, still present at that time). These excavations, carried out by means of dug trenches, enabled them to determine the precise plans of the foundations of the monuments and thus to propose restored models of the stadium of Messene and its heroon, as well as the small theater or ekklesiasterion. However, they did not find all monuments, including the great theater and the Arsino√´ fountain. Only the Clepsydra fountain (where according to Pausanias, Zeus as a child was washed by the nymphs Ithome and Neda), located higher in the village of Mavrommati, was described and drawn.The members of the scientific commission of the Morea Expedition studying the ruins of the stadium of ancient Messene (detail of a lithograph by Prosper Baccuet)  First archaeological excavations of Olympia and the discovery of the temple of Olympian Zeus  ancient Olympia and of the temple of Olympian Zeus discovered by the Morea expedition in May 1829 (by Guillaume-Abel Blouet and Pierre Achille Poirot) Then, the expedition spent six weeks, starting on May 10, 1829, in Olympia.Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 56 L√©on-Jean-Joseph Dubois (Archaeology section) and Abel Blouet (Architecture and Sculpture section) undertook the first excavations there. They were accompanied by the painters Fr√©d√©ric de Gournay, Pierre Achille Poirot, Pierre F√©lix Tr√©zel and Amaury-Duval, as well as a troop of more than a hundred workers. The site of Olympia had been rediscovered in 1766 by the English antiquarian Richard Chandler. Since then, it had been visited by many other travellers such as Fauvel, Pouqueville, Gell, Cokerell and Leake. Its general identification by the archaeologists of the Morea expedition was made possible thanks to the more precise descriptions of Edward Dodwell (for Dubois) and John Spencer Stanhope (for Blouet). Most of the buildings were invisible, because as Abel Blouet noted, they must have been covered with a thick layer of sediment due to the frequent overflows of rivers Alfeios and Kladeos.\\"Another observation which completely destroys these assumptions, is that the excavations which we had made at the temple of Olympian Jupiter, proved to us that the ancient soil of the plain was 10 and 12 feet below the modern soil. In this modern soil, which is a ground of alluvium brought by the waters of both the Alfeios and those which came down from the sandy mountains that surround the valley, one should not look for traces of the hippodrome and the stadium, since this land did not exist when there was a stadium and an hippodrome.\\" Abel Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 58 Only a single large fragment of a Doric column was visible. It had already been spotted by the previous travellers because the inhabitants of neighboring villages had dug trenches there to remove the stone, but none of them had attributed it with certainty to the temple of Zeus. Abel Blouet specified:Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 61 \\"Therefore, there could have been no merit in discovering a monument there. But what could have been a discovery was to find evidence that this monument was the famous temple of Olympian Jupiter. And this is what our excavations have enabled us to demonstrate. When we arrived at Olympia, Mr. Dubois, director of the Archaeology section of our expedition, had already been there for a few days with Mr. Tr√©zel and Mr. Amaury Duval, his collaborators. Following the instructions which had been given to him by the commission of the Institute, this antiquarian (Dubois) had begun the excavations of which the result had been the discovery of the first bases of the two columns of the pronaos and several fragments of sculpture.\\" The archaeological advice of Jean-Nicolas Huyot was thus followed. Dubois installed his workers on the front side of the temple and Blouet installed his own on the back side in order to give these excavations all possible extension. The painter Amaury- Duval gave in his Souvenirs (1829-1830) a personal, direct and precise, testimony\\"Before looking for a site to establish our camp, a real natural curiosity made us go on an adventure. Some Greeks who plowed their field, as always with the pistol and the yatagan on their belts, offered to guide us. Mr. Dubois, believing that he already knew enough the place, wanted to do without their help, and chance made it so that I, who was far from having this pretension, arrived first on the site of the temple that my colleagues found, later, to be that of Olympian Zeus. Here is how. A Greek, whom Mr. Dubois had rejected, attached himself to me, and, probably looking for the tip, wanted to lead me to a place, which his pantomime made me suppose to be very interesting. \\"Go ahead, if you like, said Mr. Dubois; but he will lead you to some uninteresting Roman ruin.\\" So I followed my guide to a part of the almost inaccessible plain, covered with shrubs, grasses, huge stones, but shapeless and which rose from the ground at an equal distance. This confused heap of materials of all kinds seemed to me, however, to deserve attention. I came back to rejoin Mr. Dubois, whom I found disappointed to have encountered only uninviting ruins, very badly preserved, and nothing which seemed to lead to any discovery. My account made him think: he went, with Tr√©zel and me, towards the place I had just seen, and decided immediately that the excavations would be started there\\", Eug√®ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval, Souvenirs (1829-1830), Chapter IX, Librairie Plon, E. Plon, Nourrit et Cie, imprimeurs-√©diteurs, Paris, 1885. of the events which led to the exact identification of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, which was thus determined for the first time.Map of the location of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, in Blouet, 1831, v. I metopes of Olympia transferred to the Louvre with the authorization of the Greek government by the Morea expedition Here again, the precise descriptions of the sculptures, structural elements of the temple and metopes representing the Twelve Labours of Heracles made by Pausanias who visited the site during the second century AD, proved crucial to validate the identity of the temple of Zeus. These sculptures, which reflect the beginnings of classical art and of the severe style, strongly struck the archaeologists in Olympia and in Paris at the Academy by their novel type imbued with naturalism.Extract of the report of Mr. Raoul-Rochette, read at the public session of the four Academies, on April 30, 1831. in Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 62 Model for restoration of the Temple of Olympian Zeus (by Abel Blouet) As with the excavations led at Messene, the site was divided topographically into squares, trenches were dug, excavations were undertaken in straight lines, and models for restoration were proposed: archaeology was becoming rationalized. The simple treasure hunt was beginning to be abandoned. The fundamental contribution of the Morea scientific expedition was its total indifference towards looting, treasure hunting, and antiquities smuggling. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues with the intent of taking a piece separated from the rest without regard, as Elgin had done on the Parthenon some twenty-five years before.Olga Polychronopoulou, Arch√©ologues sur les pas d‚ÄôHom√®re., p. 33. It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were transferred in their entirety to the Louvre Museum (with the authorization of the Greek Government of Ioannis Kapodistrias). However, many precious works they excavated were re-buried in order to protect them, according to the direct testimony of Amaury-Duval.\\"We left the valley of the Alfeios, with real sadness and regretting not being able to take away some souvenirs; but the fragments of sculpture, even the smallest, were of an embarrassing volume and weight.There was, among other works, a marble foot, of admirable work, which was still attached to a part of the base: lest it be subjected to yet another more complete mutilation, we went to bury it, Tr√©zel and I, in a deeply dug hole. Who knows ? this fragment will perhaps deceive some antiquaire of the future, if he discovers it at the place where we placed it.\\" Eug√®ne-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval, Souvenirs (1829-1830), p. 201, Chapter XIII \\"D√©part d'Olympie\\", Librairie Plon, E. Plon, Nourrit et Cie, imprimeurs- √©diteurs, Paris, 1885. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments represented epistemological progress. Byzantine Greece View, section and plan of the church of Samari (by Abel Blouet) The French did not limit their interest to antiquity; they also described, reported plans and meticulously drew Byzantine monuments. Quite often, and until then for the travellers as well, only ancient Greece mattered; medieval and modern Greece were ignored. Blouet, in his Expedition scientifique de Mor√©e ; Architecture, Sculptures, Inscriptions et Vues du P√©lopon√®se, des Cyclades et de l'Attique, gave very precise descriptions of the churches he saw, especially those of Navarino (Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior, inside the new fortress N√©okastro), Osphino (destroyed village which no longer exists), Modon (Church of Saint Basil), Androusa (Church of St. George), Samari (Church of Zoodochou Pigis) or of the Vourkano monastery (or Voulkano, monastery of the Holy Mother) among others.Blouet 1838, p. 21 Foundation of the French School at Athens The results obtained by the Morea scientific expedition underscored the need to create a permanent, stable structure that would allow its work to continue. From 1846, it was possible to systematically and permanently continue the work initiated by the Morea scientific expeditionCavvadias, General Ephor of Antiquities, ‚ÄúDiscours pour le cinquantenaire de l'Ecole Fran√ßaise d'Ath√®nes‚Äù, Bulletin de Correspondance Hell√©nique., XXII, 1899, p. LVIII. due to the creation on rue Didot, at the foot of Mount Lycabettus, of a French scientific institution, in the form of the French School at Athens. = End of the scientific mission = The vast majority of members of the scientific expedition paid a heavy price for the fevers they suffered during their sojourn in Morea. Many were forced to shorten their stay on the peninsula and to be repatriated to France before the beginning of 1830. The topographic brigade was severely affected: out of eighteen officers who had been successively employed in the topographical works of the Morea, three had died there and ten, whose health was ruined, were forced to retire.Henri- Marie-Auguste Berthaut (1848-1937, French General, director of the Geographical Service of the Army (1903-1911)), Les ing√©nieurs-g√©ographes militaires 1624-1831, (Gallica - BnF), Paris 1902. Captain Peytier wrote in 1834: \\"It is geodesy that ruins my health and I do not want anymore to do it in the mountains, at any cost whatsoever.\\" They were therefore reduced to work only during the cool season and to stop for summer, the season during which they drew their maps. Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent, meanwhile wrote: \\"The horrible heat that beset us in July placed the entire topographic brigade in disarray. These gentlemen, having worked in the sun, have nearly all taken ill, and we grieved to see M.

As for the physical sciences section, its members had forgotten to install mosquito nets in their tents before exploring the mouth of the Eurotas in July 1829, and subsequently they were bitten by a species of mosquito that Gaspard Auguste Brull√© was the first to describe scientifically as the Culex kounoupi Br., Pierre Th√©odore Virlet d'Aoust, Sextius Delaunay, Prosper Baccuet, Gaspard Auguste Brull√©, three muleteers, two sappers, an interpreter and the valet Villars, were all seized with violent fevers, which sometimes worsened to the point of delirium, and which precipitated the departure of the section for Malvoisie, thus suspending their works. Bory de Saint-Vincent, one of the only members of the section to be spared from the disease, took a ca√Øque and immediately went to Nafplio by sea, despite the storms, to seek help. The Bavarian philhellene doctor Mr. Zuccarini was then sent to Malvoisie and saved all his patients, except a sapper and the valet Villars who both died. President Ioannis Kapodistrias then placed a steamship at their disposal to repatriate them to Nafplion, then from there, to France. Bory de Saint-Vincent, Pierre F√©lix Tr√©zel, Virlet d'Aoust and Peytier will then explore the Cyclades and Attica. In the Archaeology section, L√©on-Jean- Joseph Dubois, Edgar Quinet and Amaury-Duval have been also affected by fever and were then prematurely repatriated to France.\\"Some health reasons having forced Messrs Dubois and Duval to return to France, I will continue the voyage alone with the instructions that Monsieur Dubois leaves me in writing. He takes with him the drawings I have made since the beginning of our campaign.\\" Pierre F√©lix Tr√©zel, Journal de voyage de M.

The kingdom's capital was located at Ambohimanga. Early years Born Rakotomavo (\\"Yellow Man\\") at Ambohitrontsy (also Ambohitrosy) to Princess Rangorinimerina and her husband, Prince Andriamifonozozoro. He was the grandson of King Andriamasinavalona of Imerina on his mother's side and was therefore a prince of Imerinatsimo, one of several independent principalities within the borders of the formerly united Merina kingdom. At the time of Rakotomavo's birth, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana Andriandrazaka was the ruler of Imerina Avaradrano, the easternmost and largest of these Merina principalities. The king's marriages to multiple spouses did not yield heirs, although he was able to father an illegitimate child out of wedlock with a woman of non-noble blood. To satisfy the ancestral requirements establishing legitimacy of a sovereign of Imerina, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana adopted prince Rakotomavo as his heir. The people of Avaradrano had great difficulty accepting him as their legitimate ruler regardless of the king's wishes. Upon assuming the kingship on the death of Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana in 1730, Rakotomavo adopted the name Andriambelomasina (\\"Living Sacred King\\"). He was also called Andriamaheritsialainolotany (\\"Strong King Whose Land Cannot Be Stolen\\"). Rule The historic fortified village of Ambohidratrimo, one of the twelve sacred hills of Imerina, was the location of Andriambelomasina's capital and rova palace; today, the former location of his palace is marked by a vatolahy monolithic standing stone. Andriambelomasina initially encountered difficulty establishing acceptance of his rule over Avaradrano. To ensure the loyalty of his people, he concluded a political marriage of alliance with an Avaradrano princess. The king was interested in re-establishing a unified Imerina by bringing together all the warring principalities of the former kingdom under his rule. This effort was ultimately unsuccessful. Andriambelomasina's rule was distinguished by the introduction of the first Malagasy mint, which was used to produce tavaiky silver coins based on the model of the Portuguese piastre. Foreign coins had long been a preferred currency in dealings with foreign slavers and traders; monarchs were often buried with these valuable items in a display of their wealth. The venture was not long-lasting, however. Its rapid collapse was likely due to a massive influx of foreign-produced coinage following the economic development of the nearby Mascarene islands.Campbell, G. \\"The Structure of Trade in Madagascar, 1750-1810.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies, 26(1), 1993, pp. 111-148. He also established a standard measurement called the vata, equivalent to about 15 liters. When Andrianampoinimerina later developed a more complete system of measurements and imposed its use across his realm, he preserved the vata measurement (in slightly modified form) in honor of his grandfather. Andrianampoinimerina decreed that this original vata was to continue to be used in perpetuity in Ikaloy where Andriambelomasina had reigned. Family and succession Andriambelomasina had two wives: the first, his principal wife, was Queen Rasoherimananitany; the second was Queen Renidrodonimerina. Andriambelomasina had three sons. The oldest, Andrianjafy (Andrianjafinandriamanitra), succeeded on the death of his father in 1770 to the throne of Imerina Avaradrano at Ambohimanga. Andrianjafy's brothers were named Andriantsimitoviaminandriana and Andriantsimitovizafinitrimo. Andriambelomasina was also the grandfather of the great Merina King, Andrianampoinimerina. Believing that the part of the Kingdom of Imerina he ruled was threatened, Andriambelomasina had the strategic idea to marry his daughter Ranavalonanadriambelomasina to the King Andriamiaramanjaka of Ikaloy and Anjafy, a Zafimamy/Alahamadintany Kingdom north of Ambohimanga. The son born of this union, Andrianampoinimerina, would go on to reunify Imerina during his reign and extend his rule beyond the highlands of Madagascar, thereby establishing the basis for the unification of the entire island of Madagascar--an aim pursued and almost completely achieved by Andrianampoinimerina's son Radama I (1810-1831). Before his death, Andriambelomasina declared that his eldest son, Andrianjafy, would succeed him, and that his grandson Andrianampoinimerina would rule after Andrianjafy, thereby establishing the order of succession. Andriambelomasina died in 1770 and was laid to rest in the family tomb in Ambohimanga inside a coffin made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, in the tradition of the nobles of Imerina at the time. There is a street named after him in Antananarivo.

Despite being a three-time premiership player, Lang will be remembered by history as the joint record holder for the longest ban received from the tribunal. Recruited by coach Jack Worrall in 1905, Lang debuted for Carlton in the opening round of the following season. He played as a rover, winning premierships in his first three years at the club and in 1909 was voted by The Australasian newspaper as the most 'Outstanding player in the VFL'. During the 1910 final series he became involved in a match fixing scandal after being dropped from the side for their 2nd semi final against South Melbourne. It had been alleged that he had accepted a bribe to play poorly, along with teammates Doug Gillespie and Doug Fraser. Both Carlton and the VFL launched their own investigations and Lang admitted that an offer had been made to him. He claimed however that he did not intend on accepting it. Regardless of his plea of innocence he was found guilty along with Fraser and both were banned for 99 games, a total of five years. Doug Gillespie was exonerated and played in the club's losing Grand Final. Lang returned to the game in 1916 and brought up his 100th game for Carlton. He retired the following season after playing only three games. The story of his fall from grace is recounted in the 2020 book On the Take by Tony Joel and Mathew Turner. Joel is a history lecturer at Deakin University.

The result ended with a Swedish victory.  Background  The Swedish army captured Warsaw in late July 1655, after the Polish capital had been abandoned by King John II Casimir. Soon afterwards, the Swedes began chasing the Polish troops, who retreated southwards. On September 9, near Inow≈Ç√≥dz, a unit under Stefan Czarniecki attacked the Swedish rear guard of 500, commanded by George Forgell. The Poles managed to kill some 200 Swedes, but this did not halt the advance of the invaders. The Swedish army continued its march southwards, capturing and burning the towns of Inow≈Ç√≥dz, Drzewica and Odrzyw√≥≈Ç. On September 12, the siege of Opoczno began. The town, lacking modern fortifications, quickly capitulated, and was almost completely destroyed, with only 20 houses left intact. A similar fate awaited other local towns: in Drzewica, only 21 houses remained, and only 22 in Odrzyw√≥≈Ç. Local residents were shaken by the barbarity of the Swedish invaders, as the northwestern corner of Lesser Poland had not experienced such vast destruction since the 13th century Mongol invasion of Poland. In early September 1655, Polish forces loyal to John II Casimir concentrated near Wolborz. Charles Gustav decided to confront them, leaving Warsaw on September 12. Polish units in Wolborz consisted mostly of men raised by the nobility through a lev√©e en masse from Mazovia and northern Lesser Poland who was no match for experienced Swedish mercenaries. Since morale among the Poles was low, John Casimir planned to withdraw towards Krak√≥w. The nobility disagreed with this plan, demanding to fight the invaders near their homes. On September 15, the Royal Crown army and lev√©e en masse units, altogether numbering some 11,000, reached ≈ªarn√≥w, where Polish king decided to personally face Charles Gustav. The Swedish army was of similar strength, but with more infantry and 40 artillery pieces, versus six Polish cannons.  The battle  After an attack by Polish cavalry was fought off by the Swedes, Charles Gustav ordered the infantry forward, with support from the artillery. The Swedes advanced, capturing a hill, which had served as a Polish defensive position. The Poles tried to prevent this, but facing Swedish fire superiority, they had to withdraw. Soon afterwards, Swedish cavalry entered the fray, but the battle was ended by heavy rain, which saved the Polish army from complete destruction. Retreating Polish units were chased by the Swedes, who captured the best soldiers and forced them to serve in the Swedish army. The nobility abandoned the battlefield and returned to their homes.  Aftermath  The Swedish victory opened the road to the province of Lesser Poland. Altogether, the Poles lost some 1,000 men. Those units that evaded capture marched towards W≈Çoszczowa and Krak√≥w, commanded by Stefan Czarniecki and King John II Casimir. The King, broken and defeated, reached Krak√≥w on September 19. At first, John Casimir planned to defend the ancient Polish capital at all costs, but changed his mind and left the city, leaving it under the command of Czarniecki. A few days later, the Polish monarch crossed the Polish-Silesian border. One of the hills located in ≈ªarn√≥w is still called Szwedzka G√≥ra (Swedish Mountain), as, according to a legend, King John II Casimir watched the 1655 battle from this hill. The town of ≈ªarn√≥w itself was burned to the ground by the Swedes to such an extent that 21 years after the battle, the population of ≈ªarn√≥w was only 120, while before the battle, it had reached 1,000. The northwestern corner of historic Lesser Poland, which had until then been prosperous, was turned into a desert, and with other towns in the region, such as Opoczno, Inow≈Ç√≥dz, Drzewica and Odrzyw√≥≈Ç, ≈ªarn√≥w never fully recovered: \\"It is not an exaggeration to claim that the cataclysm of the Swedish Deluge can be compared with the barbarity of the Nazis in the Second World War\\", wrote local historian Krzysztof Nawrocki.

Club career After establishing himself as one of the most talented young strikers in Greece during the first few years of his career at Panionios, Mantzios earned a transfer to Greek giants Panathinaikos in 2005. In his first four seasons with Panathinaikos, Mantzios proved to be an important player, whether playing from the start or as a substitute ‚Äì in total, scoring 18 goals in 68 Greek Super League matches and five goals in 20 European matches. One of his most notable achievements was scoring four goals in eight matches in the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Champions League, helping Panathinaikos finish top of its group, ahead of Inter Milan, Werder Bremen and Anorthosis Famagusta FC. In his last two seasons though, Mantzios struggled for playing time, with some tough new competition at the striker position, as Panathinaikos brought in prominent foreign strikers Djibril Ciss√© (Greek Super League top scorer in 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11), Sebasti√°n Leto and Sidney Govou, while generally employing a one-striker system. As a result, Panathinaikos sent Mantzios out on loan, to Anorthosis in 2009‚Äì10 (six goals in 14 games) and Portuguese club Mar√≠timo in 2010‚Äì11 (only one match played, due to a knee injury). Manztios' contract with Panathinaikos expired at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, and during the summer transfer period he joined Super League club OFI Crete on a one-year contract. In 2011‚Äì12, Manztios was OFI's leading scorer with seven goals in 22 Super League matches. In his last season though, Mantzios joined Baku for a total of 8 matches, before he returned to Greek Super League for Atromitos. At the beginning of the season 2013‚Äì14, he signed for Levadiakos F.C. for a two-years' contact. On 18 August 2013, he made his debut with the club by scoring one goal in a 2‚Äì2 home draw against Panthrakikos. In May 2013, Mantzios was awarded $280,000 from FK Baku by FIFA over unfulfilled contract obligations. After his two years spell in Levadiakos, who got relegated, he came close to agree on moving to Platanias, though the club attacked to Mantzios for not following the oral agreement they had and eventually the deal didn't close. After that event, Mantzios was approached by Veria. On 1 July 2015, the two sides made an oral agreement,ŒíŒïŒ°ŒüŒôŒë: Œ•œÄŒøŒ≥œÅŒ¨œÜŒµŒπ Œø ŒõœåœÄŒµŒ∏ Œ≠Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπœÉŒµ Œ¨ŒªŒªŒøœÖœÇ œÑŒ≠œÉœÉŒµœÅŒπœÇ and both sides will sign the contract in a due course.

The series is about the colourful crew of M√©t√©o+, a fictional francophone weather channel for the Northeastern Ontario region based in Sudbury. Characters * Bernard Vaillancourt () is a newly divorced news producer from Sherbrooke, hired to oversee the channel and its staff. Not informed until his arrival in Sudbury that he's actually helming a weather channel, not a news channel, he is initially reluctant to take the job, but is eventually convinced. His culture shock at being in an unfamiliar city with its own political and cultural rivalries continues to influence his decisions. Thankfully, BM, the senior producer, is there to steer him in the right direction. His continued obsession with his ex-wife, Lara, whom he continues to have discussions with through an old photograph impedes on his ability to move on. * Pierre Douglas Gu√©rin (), the CEO of M√©t√©o+, is a businessman with delusions of being the next Ted Turner ‚Äî even going so far as to adopt the nickname Ted instead of his own given names. * Conrad (Conny) Fillion (), the federal Member of Parliament for Moulin √† Fleur, is a longtime friend of Gu√©rin's who regularly pulls special favours from bureaucrats and government officials in Ottawa on behalf of M√©t√©o+, in order to establish his political legacy and earn himself a sinecure in the Senate. Self-serving, corrupt and possessed of a touch of megalomania, he is on his fourth wife, has lost count of his extramarital mistresses, and spends more time hanging out at M√©t√©o+ than he does in his role as a member of the Royal Commission on Official Languages. * B√©atrice- Marie Williams (Micheline Marchildon), nicknamed BM, is the network's ambitious and perfectionist but sometimes insecure senior producer. Having worked for Gu√©rin for ten years, she continues to dream of her opportunity to move on to a more powerful and lucrative media job with T√©l√©-Canada. She dislikes Bernard, whom she incorrectly assumes is a slick hotshot from Montreal, and is not above using sarcasm to put him in his place; over the course of the series, however, she and Bernard gradually develop a complex romantic tension which isn't eased by the fact that they're both in relationships with other people. She was initially offered Bernard's job, but turned it down because she didn't want to feel tied down. She had an unstable family life growing up, with a constant succession of stepparents entering and exiting her life because neither of her parents could sustain a relationship for very long. During the show's run, she gets romantically involved with Tristan. * Mario Czhwaenski (St√©phane Paquette), the network's lead camera operator, is the fluently bilingual son of a Polish Canadian father and a Franco-Ontarian mother. A slightly rebellious but amiable young man in his first job out of college, he is always seen wearing his trademark Kangol cap and refers to most of his colleagues by nicknames such as Big Boss (Ted), Big Bern (Bernard), Beemer (BM) or Billie the Kid (Billie Jean). * Gratien Desrosiers () is the network's bow-tied and occasionally tongue-tied lead anchor. Middle-aged and slightly neurotic, he is still under the thumb of his domineering mother Gratienne, getting flustered whenever she visits him at the studio or calls in to criticize his on-camera appearance, and resenting her refusal to tell him who his real father is. Usually, however, he's more composed and smooth on camera, as well as a quick thinker ‚Äî but his standards of perfectionism may also be unrealistically high for the setting in which he finds himself. * Billie Jean Caron (), a reporter for the network and a former DJ at a country radio station, is a young woman who regularly includes anecdotes about her pet dog Fluffy in her weather reports. Gratien hates Billie Jean's perky hosting style and is constantly pressuring her to be more serious and sedate. * Gis√®le Mailloux () is the network's receptionist, who manages to keep the office under control despite spending more time on the phone with her parents or her truck driver husband Gilles than she does actually working. She keeps a stash of cheese curds in her desk, which many of the staff ‚Äî especially Mario ‚Äî are constantly trying to get into. Although usually amiable and efficient, when she gets angry her temper can be utterly ferocious. In later seasons, she begins to work on air as a substitute anchor and host of a call-in show, eventually giving up the reception job for a full- time role as the station's third on-air anchor. * Tristan Patry (Frank Chiesurin) is an independent management consultant who is initially contracted to host a team-building seminar, and becomes romantically involved with BM. A strict vegetarian and a follower of spiritual practices such as shamanism and meditation, his relationship with her is often strained by the conflict between his belief system and BM's more conventional ways. * Spare Change (Roch Castonguay) is a mysterious homeless man who lives in the alleyway behind M√©t√©o+'s office. Nicknamed \\"Spare Change\\" because nobody knows his real name, he is extremely wise and intelligent, and sometimes hints at having had a more successful career in the past which was derailed by a personal crisis he refuses to divulge. In the show's final season he fakes his death and re- emerges, more clean cut and well-dressed, as an applicant for the job of security guard at M√©t√©o+ ‚Äî and is finally revealed as Dr. Bourgeois, a psychiatrist from Montreal who abandoned his former career after an existential crisis. * Gratienne Desrosiers () is Gratien's domineering and flamboyant mother, who gave birth to him after a teenage affair with a visiting astronaut from Alabama. She is the president of the provincial Franco-Ontarian lobby group F√©d√©ration des organismes culturels de l‚ÄôOntario fran√ßais, or FOCOF. She succeeds Conny as the local Member of Parliament after he finally gets his long-sought Senate appointment. * Gignac (Christian Laurin) is a multidisciplinary artist who knows no boundaries to his artistic integrity. Pragmatic in nature, he understands that in order to make a living in his field, one must acquire the expertise necessary to obtain the financing available to artists; he eventually shocks everyone when he accepts a professional job as Conny Fillion's political assistant. * Lara (Fanie Lavigne) is Bernard's ex-wife. She appears primarily as a talking photograph, a dramatic device used to illustrate Bernard's own internal dialogue and turmoil around the recent breakup of his marriage. Most prominent in the first season, she appears less frequently in later seasons. * Chantal L'Amour () is the station's new receptionist in the show's final season, when Gis√®le has transferred to a full-time role as an on-air personality. She also gradually becomes a love interest for Gratien despite his mother's harsh disapproval. Themes The show is a comedic take on a genuine social and political issue. With almost 45,000 francophones living in the city, Sudbury has one of the largest francophone communities of any city in Canada outside of Quebec ‚Äî this community is in fact significantly larger than some cities in Quebec which have their own television stations ‚Äî and a further 133,000 live in the rest of Northeastern Ontario. Despite this, the region has no locally oriented francophone television service ‚Äî at the time of the series' production, the region only had rebroadcast transmitters of Radio-Canada's Toronto affiliate (CBLFT-DT) and TFO, and as a result, francophone viewers otherwise had to rely on cable television services based in Montreal. (Since the 2012 closure of Radio-Canada and TFO's transmitters in the region, all francophone television is limited to cable and satellite.) In coverage of the initial program announcement, Charbonneau stated that many francophones in Sudbury and Northeastern Ontario really do believe that Montreal-based services such as RDI (EastLink, the cable provider in Sudbury, does not carry M√©t√©oM√©dia) frequently get even current local weather conditions wrong.\\"TV series to be shot in city in the fall; French sitcom possible thanks to provincial funding\\", Sudbury Star, June 15, 2007.

Production history The first sitcom ever produced for a primarily Franco-Ontarian audience, production on the series began in 2007 when producer Robert Charbonneau received a $2.5 million grant from the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund on June 15, 2007. It was expected to create up to 170 jobs in the Sudbury area.\\"TFO to film French-language comedy in Greater Sudbury\\" , Northern Life, June 18, 2007. The series was written by Robert Marinier and Luc Th√©riault, and produced by Les Productions R. Charbonneau and Carte Blanche Films. The series was filmed in a studio space in Sudbury's Rainbow Centre mall, which was the largest television studio in Ontario outside of Toronto, \\"Le plus grand studio de t√©l√© ontarien √† l‚Äôext√©rieur de Toronto\\" , Le Voyageur, September 26, 2007. while external location shots place the fictional studio on Durham Street near the YMCA and the Sudbury Arena. As the series aired on a non-commercial public television network, scenes were separated by brief interstitial shots of various locations throughout the city of Sudbury rather than by commercial breaks. In Seasons 2 and 3, each episode was also followed by a brief \\"M√©t√©o+ sur la route\\" segment, in which Chanda Legroulx, in character as Billie Jean Caron, presents a local interest report from a community in Northern Ontario; in the final season, each episode was followed by a brief interview segment featuring one of the cast or crew members. Dennis Landry, the executive director of Music and Film in Motion, a local entertainment industry development agency in Sudbury, also cited M√©t√©o+ as a major coup which would provide a tremendous boost to the agency's efforts to build and sustain a film and television production industry in the city.\\"Lights! Camera! Action!\\" , Northern Life, September 21, 2007. Mignault, Blais and Castonguay worked together in the earlier TFO series Francoeur, which was itself the first dramatic television series ever produced for a Franco-Ontarian audience. That series was also produced and created by Charbonneau. Another French language sitcom revolving around a weather channel, Miss M√©t√©o, also launched in 2008 on the Quebec- based cable network S√©ries+. The series' final season aired in winter 2011.\\"Sudbury to see new francophone TV series\\". Northern Ontario Business, May 27, 2010.

Sr√≤n a‚Äô Choire Ghairbh is a Scottish mountain situated on the northern side of Loch Lochy, 13 kilometres north of Spean Bridge in the Highland Council area. Overview Sr√≤n a‚Äô Choire Ghairbh reaches a height of 937 metres (3074 feet) and is classified as both a Munro and a Marilyn. It is highest of the Loch Lochy hills and is invariably climbed along with the neighbouring Munro of Meall na Teanga to which it is joined by the distinctive col of the Cam Bhealach. Both these hills which are often referred to as the Loch Lochy Munros are well seen from the A82 road on the opposite side of the loch, showing steep slopes which are forested below the 300 metre contour. There are also extensive conifer plantings on the lower northern (Glen Garry) side of the mountain, this is gradually being restored to native species.Forestry Commission website. Gives details on Glen Garry Forest. The hills name translates from the Gaelic as The Nose of the Rough Corrie\\"The Munros\\" Page 146 (Gives translation). referring to the summits location on the edge of the craggy Coire Glas, which stands to the east. Geography Sr√≤n a‚Äô Choire Ghairbh‚Äôs main geographical feature is the Coire Glas which has the small Loch a‚Äô Choire Ghlais within its upper recesses. The mountain is horse shoe shaped and throws down two ridges on either side of the corrie, the lengthy east ridge is five kilometres long and goes over the two subsidiary tops of Sean Mheall (888 metres) and Meall nan Dearcag (693 metres) before descending to the Kilfinnan Burn at the north end of Loch Lochy. Another ridge called Meall a‚Äô Choire Ghlais goes north and then north east along the other side of Corrie Glas, it loses very little height for two kilometres before descending steeply and rockily to the Beallach Easain (548 metres) which connects it to the Corbett Ben Tee. In all other directions the mountain is steep and grassy, to the south lies the Cam Beallach, a mountain pass that links to the Munro Meall na Teanga, the Cam Beallach is seen as a distinct notch in the skyline between the two Munros whether viewed from the east or the west. To the north is the small Coire an Eich which drains north into Glen Garry to find its way to the sea at the east coast via Loch Ness. Sr√≤n a‚Äô Choire Ghairbh is actually on the main north- south water divide of Scotland with rainfall on all other parts of the hill going to the west coast via Loch Lochy and Loch Linnhe. Ascents Sr√≤n a‚Äô Choire Ghairbh is nearly always climbed from the Cam Beallach, however there are two possible ways of arriving there. The southern approach starts at the car park at the Eas Cia-aig waterfall on the B8005 at grid reference , Gleann Cia-aig is ascended to its head where the Cam Beallach is clearly in view\\"The Munros\\" Page 146 (Gives ascent from Glen Cia-aig). . The approach from the north east starts at the car park at Laggan Locks just off the A82 at grid reference and takes the rising track through the forest on Loch Lochy‚Äôs northern side to reach the Cam Beallach.\\"The Munros\\" Page 141 (Gives route from Laggan Locks). The continuation to the summit from the Cam Beallach follows a very good stalkers path which zig zags up the mountainside to the highest point which overlooks Coire Glas. The mountain has a substantial prominence of 622 metres ensuring that the summit is a fine viewpoint for the surrounding mountains of Lochaber and beyond. Sr√≤n a‚Äô Choire Ghairbh is one of the few hills in Scotland that has a visitors book at its summit (Mam Sodhail being one of the others). The book is kept in a coffee jar inside a wooden box and is maintained by Richard Wood of Invergarry. Glasgow Digital Library. Gives details of summit visitors book. The two Loch Lochy Munros are sometimes climbed by travellers on the Great Glen Way between Fort William and Inverness, the two hills offering variety on what is a low level multi day walk.

It was established in 1892, making it the 7th oldest college in Bangladesh. Since then it has played an important role in the educational, cultural, and political spheres of Greater Sylhet.Official website  History  M C College was established on 27 June 1892 by a local nobleman, Raja Girish Chandra Roy of Roynagar, Sylhet with four teachers and 18 students. The college was named after his maternal great-grandfather, Murari Chand Roy. It was located beside the present Raja GC School in Bandar Bazar. At the beginning it was a proprietary college funded by Chandra himself. The original college building collapsed in the 1897 Assam earthquake, of which Chandra himself was a victim. Though he survived the quakes, the calamity made him financially vulnerable. It was not possible for him to run the college from his own resources from thereon. He urged the government to take over the college so that it could continue as an educational institution. The government took over the college in 1908 after the death of Chandra. Then it became an aided college. On 1 April 1912 the college become fully government administered and was considered as an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta. In 1916, Syed Abdul Majid upgraded Murari Chand College's status to first grade degree level and laid the school's foundation stone in Thackeray Hills alongside William Sinclair Marris in 1921. Abdul Khaliq Choudhury of Bijli (1886-1948) was the first Muslim student of the college. He was a member of the Assam council from 1921 to 1936 as well as the South Sylhet Local Board and Dhaka University Syndicate. In 1925 the college moved to its current campus at Thackarey Hills (now Tilagarh). It is spread on an area of 112 acres of land of a beautiful natural set-up. In 1942 the golden jubilee of the college was observed by the publishing of the Murari Chand College Golden Jubilee Volume. After the Partition of India in 1947, the college became an affiliate of the University of Dhaka. It then became an affiliate of the University of Chittagong in 1968. Finally in 1992, it becomes an affiliate of the National University, Bangladesh. In 2001, the college had 130 teachers and 6,000 students. There are seven residential hostels for students, which is one of the best residential arrangements of students at the college level in Bangladesh. In 2000, the college won the national award as the best educational institution. The library of M C College is famous for its collection of books, which numbers around 100,000.

Lapham), which re-published some of his political history books in 2003. As an historian, he emphasized the close relationship between domestic and international politics, and the shallowness of the modern two- party system of the US, proposing power and militarism, not money, as the corrupting influences upon politics. Life Walter Karp was born in Brooklyn, New York City, son of Morris and Libbie Karp. He studied anthropology at Columbia College of Columbia University, and was graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1955. He began his career as a popular science writer, penning Charles Darwin and the Origin of Species (1968) a young-adult book about Charles Darwin. Later, he began writing about politics, his opposition response to the Vietnam War (1945‚Äì76). In 1969, he and H. R. Shapiro, a friend and fellow writer, founded the fortnightly magazine The Public Life, which W. H. Auden praised. As an intellectual, he named Thomas Jefferson and Hannah Arendt as two great influences, and the Founding Fathers of the United States as political influences, thus the eighteenth-century inflection of his literary style. Karp died in 1989 after undergoing surgery at Roosevelt Hospital, having been admitted previously for a blockage and enlargement in his colon. He was 55. Karp was married to Regina Karp, n√©e Pollack. The couple had two children.New York Times obituary Works The Politics of War: The Story of Two Wars Which Altered Forever the Political Life of the American Republic 1890‚Äì1920 (1979) reports how William McKinley impelled the United States to fight the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (April to August 1898) and how Woodrow Wilson compelled intervention to the First World War (1914‚Äì18) and how they determined the emergence of the US as an imperial world power. What impelled the US to fight Spain was not a war-crazed public infected with yellow journalism, as most historians have for conventional wisdom, but the collusion of an ambitious political party pair seeking to again make the US a country \\"safe for oligarchy.\\" That was their response to the Populist movement of the 1890s, a destabilising threat to the \\"Republican‚ÄìDemocrat\\" two-party system. Moreover, despite the US defeating Imperial Spain, within the Republican Party, the Populist movement soon yielded to a Progressive movement led by Senator Robert La Follette, which culminated in the presidential election of 1912 in which more than 70 per cent of the votes were against the incumbent US president, William Howard Taft (1909‚Äì1913), who came third: \\"The privileged interests... seemed about to receive their death blow. Government of, by, and for the people was about to be restored to the American Republic.\\" However, the man elected president in 1912, Woodrow Wilson, was \\"a man driven by vaunting ambition\\" with very different plans for the republic. Originally very conservative with a strong belief in laissez-faire capitalism, he believed himself a \\"man of destiny\\" and altered his political beliefs to seek elected office. As an historian, Wilson dreamed of negotiating a treaty among the warring European imperial powers but knew that as president, he would have to compel the US into the Great War to fulfil his statesman's ambition of setting Imperial Europe aright. Hence his presidential favoritism towards the Allies and inflexible antagonism towards the Germans and the Central Powers, despite every belligerent having violated international law in prosecuting the war. To suit his political, man-of- destiny ambitions, Wilson embroiled the US in a European war. Most noteworthy is the First Red Scare (1917‚Äì1920), the Wilson administration's extended wartime suppression of the civil liberties of antiwar critics. He compared the wartime behaviors of Lincoln and Wilson: \\"Americans under Lincoln enjoyed every liberty that could possibly be spared; in a war safely fought 3,000 miles from our own shores, Americans under Wilson lost every liberty they could possibly be deprived of.\\" The wartime suppression of liberty \\"struck the American Republic a blow from which it has never recovered.\\" In 2003, Harper's Magazine editor Lewis Lapham compared The Politics of War to the works of Henry Brooks Adams by emphasising its contemporary relevance: \\"Karp offers a clearer understanding of our current political circumstance than can be found in any two or twenty of the volumes published over the last ten years by the herd of Washington journalists grazing on the White House lawn.\\" Liberty Under Siege: American Politics 1976‚Äì1988 (1989) develops the thematic line of articles written for Harper's Magazine, proposing that the Republican and the Democratic Parties colluded to undermine the presidency of the \\"feeble Democrat\\" Jimmy Carter (1976‚Äì80), and replace him with the \\"liar and tyrant\\" Ronald Reagan (1980‚Äì84, 84‚Äì88). Despite the harshly-accurate assessment of the time chronicled, Liberty Under Siege concludes reiterating the historian's trust in Jeffersonian democracy. \\"The Two Americas\\" article presents his perspectives of democracy and patriotism; citing the Pledge of Allegiance, he proposes that the United States of America is two countries, a republic and a nation; the republic \\"exists for its own sake\\" but the nation exists only relative to other nations and so is most alive when at war. He often quoted Lincoln's praise of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay as a man who \\"loved his country, partly because it was his own country, but mostly because it was a free country.\\" Bibliography =Political Books= * * Lewis Lapham's introduction to the 2003 reissue of The Politics of War * * =Historical Books= * * Quotes SourceQuotes from Karp * \\"The left and right wings of the party establishment--two great pinions of an ancient bird of prey.\\" * \\"The public school system: 'Usually a twelve year sentence of mind control.

It is based in Athens, Greece and was formed in late 2004. Its first release, titled In The Junkyard Volume 1, was a compilation consisting of tracks by unsigned Greek bands came out in late Spring 2005. According to the organization's official website, Spinalonga Records' ultimate goal is to provide the groundwork for a healthy rock scene in Greece. Following a do-it-yourself route, it was originally conceived as a one shot alternative/stoner rock compilation effort, but was quickly transformed into a more substantial effort. The original idea behind Spinalonga Records was to bring Greek bands together, help them promote their music as far as they can, yet without engaging in commercial music production and distribution. While its first steps were small, Spinalonga Records actively supports several Greek bands and as of 2007 it has released three compilations that include music ranging from hard rock and stoner to indie to post rock. A common denominator of all of those involved with the effort are the influences of the alternative rock genre of the 1990s which forms the core of its aesthetics. Spinalonga Records is different from many other similar efforts both in their home country and abroad, in that it was conceived and is run by members of the bands and not by individuals from the music industry. As of June 2007, Spinalonga Records was affiliated with more than 40 bands from all over Greece. In May 2007 it released its third compilation in the 'In the Junkyard' series. Since its inception it has organized numerous concerts in Athens and Thessaloniki with music that ranges from Ambient to Indie pop, Funk Rock and Alternative rock to Stoner and Heavy rock.  History and releases Spinalonga Records was conceived as an idea in the fall of 2004, when its founding bands met up and discussed the creation of a compilation containing music from Greek groups. Several months later, what ended up being the first volume of the 'In the Junkyard' series was a reality, featuring 14 groups. With the release of In the Junkyard Volume 1, three shows were organized in Athens. During the months that followed and while the second compilation was being prepared 'In the Junkyard vol.1' sold-out. Volume 2 of the series was finally released in December 2005 featuring tracks by 15 groups. Between Spring and Winter 2005 the Spinalonga events gained considerable momentum and the label's popularity started rising. In the period leading to the summer of 2006 several shows were organized, including the first one in Thessaloniki. In early Spring 2007, Spinalonga Records started compiling their latest release, In the Junkyard volume three which would be a double-CD compilation. 'Volume 3' was released in May 2007, this time featuring 28 groups from all over Greece. In 2008 the label released the first full-length album of their catalogue, the debut of Semen of the Sun (co-released with 'the Lab Records'). Misuse, Modrec and Sugah Galore followed (all co-released with Puzzlemusik, Bantha and Feedback Sound respectively). In the meantime, the label organized a couple of shows with bands from outside Greece. The first being a very promising group from Turkey, Gevende. In the fall of 2008, Brant Bjork, drummer of the legendary stoner band Kyuss, was the second foreign act to play in a Spinalonga Records' event. A list of releases is maintained on the Spinalonga records' website.

After attending the King's School in Bruton, he went up to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree and then continuing to complete his doctorate there; his PhD was awarded in 1967. In 1965, he was elected to a research fellowship at Sidney Sussex, and in 1968 was elected to a fellowship there. In the meantime, he was appointed to an assistant lectureship at the University of Cambridge in 1972, being promoted to lecturer four years later. He was promoted again to be Reader in Modern European History in 1987, and was appointed Professor of Modern European History in 1992.

(1987; a second edition was published in 1998 as The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?) and The French Revolutionary Wars (1996). In the meantime, he turned to the Habsburg monarchy and produced a biography of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in 1994; he has also published biographies of George I (2017) and Frederick the Great of Prussia (2015), the latter of which won the British Academy Medal in 2016. Since the early 2000s, Blanning's work has also focused on cultural histories of Europe, beginning in 2002 with his book The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture; this was followed by The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648‚Äì1815 (2006), The Triumph of Music: Composers, Musicians and Audiences, 1700 to the Present (2008) and The Romantic Revolution (2011). Honours In 1990, Blanning was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). In September 2016, he was awarded the British Academy Medal for his book Frederick the Great: King of Prussia (2015).

In 1653-55 the consuls de Lyon called him to decorate the h√¥tel de ville but Chaperon dying almost as soon as he arrived, the commission passed to Thomas Blanchet. Chaperon made a name for himself with his suite of engravings after the Raphael Loggie of the Vatican, Rome, 1649, but art historians remember him for the stream of fulminating invective with which Poussin in his correspondence with Paul Fr√©art de Chantelou described this unruly and vindictive practician who refused to carry through his copy of a Transfiguration. So little is known of Chaperon that this episode stands out. Most of his paintings have been optimistically attributed to Poussin, and disguised under that sellable name have entered collections in the US; thus, when the Mus√©e du Louvre purchased its first painting by Chaperon in 2005, it was at a New York auction.

History Powers & Perils (1984) by Richard Snider was scheduled for release at Origins 1983; instead the convention was filled with empty demo rooms where the game was to have appeared, and the game finally rolled out early in 1984. Powers & Perils was published by Avalon Hill as a boxed set containing five books (60 pages, 52 pages, 52 pages, 44 pages, and 24 pages respectively), a pad of character sheets, and dice. Avalon Hill's house organ magazine Heroes supported Powers & Perils and the company's other role-playing lines. Products Powers & Perils is an exceedingly detailed fantasy system, with skill-based character abilities and a spell-point magic system. There are five rulebooks: the 44-page \\"The Character Book\\" covers character creation, skills, and experience; the 52-page \\"The Combat and Magic Book\\" covers combat rules, movement, magic, and spells; the 60-page \\"The Creature Book\\" describes the surface and underworld, encounter tables, and fantastic creatures; the 52-page \\"The Book of Human Encounters and Treasure\\" covers NPCs, treasure, and magic items; and the 24-page \\"County Mordara\\" is an introductory scenario. A second boxed set contained information on the world, named Perilous Lands, in the form of three books: \\"The Map Book\\", \\"Sites of Power\\", and \\"The Culture Book\\". Subsequent expansions were printed in Heroes magazine and an adventure for high level characters, Tower of the Dead, was released in 1984. Legacy Powers & Perils was an unfortunate failure for Avalon Hill, despite their reputation for their high-quality productions; this failure was indicative of the company's lack of experience in the roleplaying field. Powers & Perils included several drawings plagiarized from fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Avalon Hill had no previous experience with role-playing games, being primarily a producer of strategy and war games such as Tactics II, Blitzkrieg and Squad Leader, and Powers & Perils died before its time. Overpricing and strong competition from first edition Dungeons & Dragons saw P&P; on store shelves at two to three times the price being asked for its contemporaries. Due to the general failure of Powers & Perils, Avalon Hill allowed the line to die after a few supplements were published in 1984. Reception In the September 1984 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #57), Adrian Knowles gave it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, saying, \\"Overall, P&P; introduces some nice ideas which can be adapted readily into other systems. The game is more suited to experienced players and GMs since it is fairly complex. In general, a greater amount of work than is normal for an RPG is needed for playing Powers and Perils, but it is a good system.\\" In the October 1984 edition of Imagine (Issue 19), Mike Dean stated that \\"I have my doubts as to whether P&P; will make it as a widely popular RPG, but I am sure it will gain a considerable and well-deserved following.\\" In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1985 edition of Different Worlds (Issue #38), Troy Christensen was unimpressed, giving the game a below- average rating of 1.5 stars out of 4, and saying that the game \\"is lost in the limbo somewhere between the complexity of Chivalry & Sorcery and the simplicity of Dungeons & Dragons.\\" Christensen found issues with character generation, which he said \\"takes about ten times longer than most fantasy games.\\" He then found combat too simplistic, and commented that \\"With a combination of simplicity and complexity mixed so unequally and haphazardly, the game seems ungainly and plays roughly.\\" He concluded with a negative recommendation, saying, \\"Powers & Perils to me adds nothing beyond what I have found in other more established games.\\" Other reviews *Fantasy Gamer #6 References External links * Powers and Perils (Unofficial Website) Category:Avalon Hill games Category:Fantasy role-playing games Category:Role- playing games introduced in 1984 ","title":"Powers &amp; Perils"},{"id":"11813741","text":"Cul-De-Sacs and Dead Ends is a compilation of B-sides and singles by The Minders.

The hardlink method establishes a reference link between a physical world object and a .mobi web page just as a traditional hyperlink establishes an electronic reference to information on a Web page. A common cell phone is the medium of this information exchange that is initiated whenever a user makes a connection with a hardlink database, such as Objecs.mobi, and enters some alphanumeric sequence found on the target object. This alphanumeric sequence may be the objects part number or common name.

The apparent visual magnitude of 8.66 means that it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye. It is located relatively close to the Sun, at a distance of 16.2 light years and has a high proper motion of 818.93 milliarcseconds per year. Gliese 832 has just under half the mass and radius of the Sun. Its estimated rotation period is a relatively leisurely 46 days. The star is roughly 9.5 billion years old. In 2014, Gliese 832 was announced to be hosting the closest potentially habitable Earth-mass-range exoplanet to the Solar System. This star achieved perihelion some 52,920 years ago when it came within an estimated of the Sun. Planetary system Gliese 832 hosts two known planets. =Discovery of Jupiter mass planet= In September 2008, it was announced that a Jupiter-like planet, now designated as Gliese 832 b, had been detected in a long-period, near-circular orbit around this star (false alarm probability thus far: a negligible 0.05%). It would induce an astrometric perturbation on its star of at least 0.95 milliarcseconds and is thus a good candidate for being detected by astrometric observations. Despite its relatively large angular distance, direct imaging is problematic due to the star‚Äìplanet contrast. =Discovery of Gliese 832 c (super-Earth mass planet) in habitable zone= In 2014, a second planet was discovered by astronomers at the University of New South Wales. This one is believed to be of super-Earth mass and has since been given the scientific name Gliese 832 c. It was announced to orbit in the optimistic habitable zone but outside the conservative habitable zone of its parent star. The planet is believed to be in, or very close to, the right distance from its sun to allow liquid water to exist on its surface. =Search for cometary disc= If this system has a comet disc, it is undetectable \\"brighter than the fractional dust luminosity 10‚àí5\\" of a recent Herschel study.

Morgan, was an American historian, accomplished researcher, biographer, editor, and critic. He specialized in material on Utah history, Mormon history, the American fur trade, and overland trails. His work is known both for its comprehensive research and accuracy and for the fluid imagery of his prose. Morgan was forced by post-lingual deafness as an early teen to communicate by letters throughout his professional life. This effort created a written network for scholars interested in Western American themes. Vast stores of correspondence indicate his willingness to help another writer or scholar, to provide information on sources and materials, or offer advice on projects. Many emerging scholars, particularly those out of the academic mainstream, considered him a mentor. As a result, Morgan stood in the center of a scholarly group of literary figures of the 1930s through 1960s involved in history and biography of the American West. These individuals included Juanita Brooks, Fawn Brodie, Bernard DeVoto, Charles Kelly, J. Roderic Korns, A. Russell Mortensen, William Mulder, and Harold Schindler.  Early life  Morgan was born in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1914 and spent his childhood and young adulthood in the city. He was the oldest of the four children of James Lowell Morgan and Emily Holmes. His father, James Morgan died of appendicitis when Dale Morgan was only five years old. To raise her children, Emily Morgan returned to college to upgrade her normal certificate to a college degree and worked until her retirement as an elementary school teacher. A promising and intelligent youth, Morgan contracted meningitis in August 1929. The disease left him with a total loss of hearing. Emily Morgan kept him home from school for an entire year, hoping that some hearing would return. Deafness cut off his ability to relate to people around him. The once popular, social, and athletic boy became socially introverted, devoting much of his time to reading and study. Morgan recalled that he had not yet reconciled himself to his deafness by the time he returned to school. In 1951, in a letter to Marguerite Sinclair Reusser, he wrote that a minor family crisis in March 1931 led to a hysterical outburst. During this emotional time, Morgan finally confided in his mother the difficulties and fears he had faced over the loss of his hearing. \\"I began to face the future instead of wasting myself in bitter regret over a past that was beyond my reach. That was the beginning of my adjustment to the fact that my hearing was gone and would probably never return.\\"Topping, Gary. Utah Historians and the Reconstruction of Western History, 2003, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma. . At this time, he began a lifelong pattern of writing, producing thousands of careful transcriptions, personal letters, and books in his field. Morgan learned and became quite competent in lip reading, but was never comfortable with the inaccuracy and ambiguity of the method. His friends noted that he could speak quite clearly but typically chose not to do so unless among people he knew well. Deafness gave him no way to regulate his voice and his conversation was locked in a high-pitched monotone. Instead he typically turned to communicating in writing, carrying on personal conversations with the use of note cards, the backs of letters, scratch paper, and other handy paper. Archivist and historiographer Gary Topping noted that \\"...because Morgan‚Äôs deafness shifted his communication with the external world entirely to the written world, his world became a literary world, and the long hours of practice with the written world turned him into a virtuosos of English prose in the same way that musical practice produces virtuosity.\\"Topping. (p. 118) As an adult his publication manuscripts exhibit heavy revisions and editing, while his letters flow through his manual typewriters and onto paper as seemingly seamless compositions, almost without typographic error. The advent of the Depression, and Morgan‚Äôs deafness, reduced his ability to find employment after graduation from high school. However, an admiring English teacher found college funds for him in a vocational rehabilitation program. From 1933 to 1937, Morgan studied commercial art at the University of Utah, taking advantage of known talents and a personal interest in drawing and graphic layout. However, he found his personal interests drawn to literary studies and writing. He was a contributor to the student newspaper, the Daily Chronicle, and added to his writing experience by contributing creative work to The Pen, the student literary publication. At college he developed a close association with other students who would be recognized for history and literature. These included future historian Helen Zeese (later Papanikolas), and Ray Benedict West Jr. Two important relationships were formed with Daily Chronicle editor Richard Scowcroft and faculty advisor Wallace Stegner. Both men became novelists and operated the respected writing programme at Stanford University.  Career as historian  In 1937, with the country still in the Depression, Morgan was unable to find a position in commercial art and occupied spare time as an occasional book reviewer for a city newspaper, the Salt Lake Tribune. In August 1938, again helped by a tip and recommendation from a friend, Morgan capitalized on his career as a reviewer to join the Utah Historical Records Survey as a part-time editor and publicist. Within a short time his ability to remember and associate facts brought him into a front-row position writing for the HRS. By 1940 he was transferred to the Utah Writers' Project to complete the state guidebook. Later he became director of the state branch of the Federal Writers Project. In these New Deal relief programs, Morgan honed his skills in research and organization. He acquired a deep understanding of primary source material and information retrieval from his work in the library of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Within months, he was a major figure in the survey of state and county records, organizing much of the work and completing the writing of surveys done for state and county archives. By 1940 he was overseeing both programs, and by 1942 had supervised the production of histories of Ogden and Provo as well as acting as a primary writer of The WPA Guide To Utah. His work was well received by his superiors in the east and by local historians. Also in 1940, Morgan published the first substantive historical study of the Provisional State of Deseret in the Utah Historical Quarterly, analyzing primary documents dealing with the State of Deseret, including the constitution and early ordinances of the state, with a lengthy editorial introduction explaining their context. He also was involved in other writing projects, including the state contribution to a history of grazing in the western U.S. During this time he began exchanging correspondence with two women who would become well- respected writers, Juanita Brooks and Fawn M. Brodie. Morgan contributed substantively to the work of each as a mentor, critic, and advocate. In 1942, unable to serve in the armed forces, Morgan moved to Washington, D.C. and worked in the central office of a war-rime regulatory agency, the Office of Price Administration. While there, his free time was spent using the relatively new National Archives and the Library of Congress, combing through federal records, reading methodically through hundreds of American newspapers and printed materials. This work netted him large files of typed transcriptions on Mormons, trans-Mississippi Native Americans, the activities of fur traders of the 1820s through 1840s, and exploration. Working in these institutions, Morgan standardized and honed his skill as a researcher. Morgan had arrived in Washington, D.C. with the idea of eventually producing an authoritative history of early Mormonism. In 1945 he was awarded a post- service Guggenheim Foundation research grant, which he activated in 1947. He left Washington, D.C. and continued his research in New York and New England as well as along the Mormon Trail through Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois, and into California. In late 1947, again in Utah and desperately needing paying work, Morgan agreed to edit the Utah Historical Quarterly, publishing the journals of the John Wesley Powell expeditions of 1869-72 between 1947 and 1949. Of necessity Morgan acted as an independent historian between 1947 and 1952. During these years, he narrowed his focus to an intended three-volume history of Mormonism, but maintained his interest in the American fur trade and exploration. After leaving Utah again for Washington D.C. in 1949 and the cancellation of his Mormon-book contract in 1952, Morgan turned to other aspects of the American West and produced several authoritative books on the West still regarded as definitive, including Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West (1953), and three bibliographies of Mormon sects. Morgan was retained by the University of California's Bancroft Library director George P. Hammond as a researcher for the Hopi-Navajo land claim lawsuit in 1953. In 1954 an appointment as an editor and research assistant at the Bancroft ended Morgan‚Äôs precarious but productive years as an independent writer and pulled him to the West Coast. In California, his work and attention was drawn more fully into overland trail and California history. During his tenure at Bancroft he wrote or edited some forty books including the edited collection of documents in Overland in 1846 (1963) and The West of William H. Ashley (1964), as well as producing well received articles and reviews. He was named a Fellow of the Utah State Historical Society in 1960 and received the Henry Raup Wagner Award in 1961. Morgan received a second Guggenheim fellowship in 1970 to support research toward a history of the American fur trade, which he never began. Morgan died of cancer in 1971 at the age of fifty-six. Later researchers have benefited from Dale Morgan's painstaking scholarship, extensive collection of correspondence, and reams of transcripts. He was the moving force behind the first unified catalogue of works about Mormonism, which he proposed to the Utah State Historical Society in 1951. Using Morgan's list, which had been re- typed and supplemented as a card file, Brigham Young University librarian Chad J. Flake completed and published A Mormon Bibliography, 1830-1930 (1978), with an introduction written by Morgan. Now in a second edition, it remains an indispensable reference work for scholars looking at Mormon history or sociology. Morgan's papers are at the Bancroft Library; most of his research library now forms part of the holdings of L. Tom Perry Special Collections at Brigham Young University. The Utah State Historical Society has established the annual \\"Dale L. Morgan Award,\\" presented to the author of the best scholarly article published in the Utah Historical Quarterly.  Skills, viewpoint, and criticism  Morgan was a great-grandson of Orson Pratt, an apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Morgan‚Äôs family actively participated in church activities. His sudden deafness, however, he caused him to drift from the LDS faith, and he did not affiliate with any religious organization as an adult. Morgan has been described by others as a \\"through going atheist.\\" He was profoundly affected by the soft positivism of 1930s social psychology and took a stance for historicism. Having rejected any religious motive as impossible, Morgan insisted that his work in western history and Mormonism present a completely-objective, exclusively-naturalistic viewpoint on religious matters, and he encouraged other Utah and western historians to follow his example. In 1943, writing to S. A. Burgess, a historian of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ), Morgan said that his \\"viewpoint about Mormon history is that of the sociologist, the psychologist, the political, economic, and social historian.\\"Walker, John Phillip, ed., Dale Morgan on Early Mormonism: Correspondence and a New History, p. 43 (1986). Historian of the Latter Day Saint movement Jan Shipps credits Morgan, along with three other notable historians (Bernard DeVoto, Fawn McKay Brodie, and Juanita Brooks), with establishing a basis for the new historiography of Mormonism through significant Mormon-related works in the 1940s and 1950s.http://www.historycooperative.org/cgibin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url;=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/94.2/shipps.html Morgan's intellectual experience in the federal WPA programs had both advantages and disadvantages for him as a historian. The independent nature of the programs encouraged his critical judgment and work ethic, forced him to work with a variety of people, and exposed him to a wide training ground on source development and research. However, it did not lead him to consider the larger meaning of the facts that he gathered or to understand the philosophy and theory of history, as taught in an academic setting. In fact, during the trials of his career, he became quite antagonistic to academic requirements. In response to a negative academic review of a work by his friend DeVoto, he wrote that \\"the term ‚Äòhistory‚Äô had better be redefined to mean, ‚Äôa species of writing produced by or enroute to a Ph.D.‚Äô I have had enough troubles trying to break a path alongside this main-traveled road to know something of the snobberies at work here, and the ways in which the academic world and even the world of learning are geared to these attitudes.\\"Topping. According to Topping, this lack of perspective and understanding led Morgan to believe \\"that historical facts contain their own meaning, and that the historian‚Äôs intellect ought to be active only in internal and external criticism, establishing the authenticity and credibility of sources, yet passive when it came to establishing the larger significance ‚Ä¶\\"Topping. As a result, Morgan \\"fell short of the interpretive potential of (his) sources...asserting that the facts would somehow convey their own meaning without any help from him....\\"Topping. However the same focus on fact, coupled to a spectacular memory for detail, allowed him to produce work of breathtaking detail and scope within the field. His strength and greatest contribution was as a documentary, rather than synthetic, historian.

The respective Lie algebra is called the Poincar√© algebra. It is possible to extend this algebra to a supersymmetry algebra, which is a \\\\mathbb{Z}_2-graded Lie superalgebra. The most common ways to do this are discussed below.  \\\\mathcal{N} = (2,2) algebra  Let the Lie algebra of IO(1,1) be generated by the following generators: * H = P_0 is the generator of the time translation, * P = P_1 is the generator of the space translation, * M = M_{01} is the generator of Lorentz boosts. For the commutators between these generators, see Poincar√© algebra. The \\\\mathcal{N}=(2,2) supersymmetry algebra over this space is a supersymmetric extension of this Lie algebra with the four additional generators (supercharges) Q_+, \\\\, Q_-, \\\\, \\\\overline{Q}_+, \\\\, \\\\overline{Q}_-, which are odd elements of the Lie superalgebra. Under Lorentz transformations the generators Q_+ and \\\\overline{Q}_+ transform as left-handed Weyl spinors, while Q_- and \\\\overline{Q}_- transform as right- handed Weyl spinors.

This is a shallow nutrient-rich freshwater lake (average depth 3 m) fed by groundwater and four streams. Small deltas have formed where the latter enter the lake, comprising extensive marshes and tree-lined riverbanks. Narrow belts of reed Phragmites fringe much of the lake. Water is abstracted for factory use and for irrigation. Cattle- and sheep-grazing is common along the lake shores. Overview taken from Manyas Bird Paradise Observation Tower Manyas Lake is an important site for breeding and wintering waterbirds. In 1938 the Ku≈ü Cenneti (Turkish for \\"Bird Paradise\\") nature reserve was set up by the German zoologist and hydrologist Curt Kosswig who worked in Turkey from 1937‚Äì1955. This 64 hectare sanctuary occupies a largely unspoiled area of the lakeside near Sƒ±ƒüƒ±rcƒ±k in the northeast corner of the lake. It has a small ornithological museum of stuffed birds in poor condition, remote-controlled viewing cameras, and an observation tower erected by the Hydrology Department of the University of Istanbul in 1952. More than 270 species of birds have been recorded at the lake. Important bird species include white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus), plus breeding populations of the vulnerable Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus). Migrating great white pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus) often roost at the lake. The Manyas spirlin is a species of cyprinid fish which is endemic to this lake's drainage basin. Conservation issues High threats include agricultural use and intensification, drainage and dam construction. Artificially high water- levels have resulted in the loss of feeding marshes. Nesting trees in the National Park have also begun to die as a result of prolonged inundation. Agricultural, industrial and household pollution enters the lake in large quantities. Due to over-fishing, disease, pollution and possibly the effects of the changing water regime, fish catches have declined drastically. Fish migration into the lake is now impossible following the construction of a regulator.

Via the Crow Wing River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of in a generally rural region. History Prior to settlement by Europeans, the vicinity of the Long Prairie River was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwa. However, according to Schoolcraft, in 1832 the land about this river was uninhabited, being a boundary or war road between the Ojibwa and the Dakota. In the Chippewa treaties in 1847, the land on the west bank was ceded by the Pillager Chippewa as a homeland for the Menomini, and the land on the east bank was ceded by the Lake Superior Chippewa and the Mississippi Chippewa as a homeland for the Winnebagos, in anticipation of Indian removal out of Wisconsin upon statehood. The Menomini refused removal and never came to Minnesota, so the land was subsequently ceded to the United States. Many of the Winnebagoes were removed, but due to ongoing skirmishes between the Pillager Chippewa and the Dakota Sioux, the Winnebagoes were in constant danger, so they requested relocation to southern Minnesota, near Mankato, and in 1855 ceded the land to the United States. Settlers had begun farming the region's prairies and clearing its timber by the 1860s. The English name of the river, according to Gilfillan, is derived from the Ojibwa Gaa-zhaagawashkodeyaa-ziibi, transliterated \\"Long- narrow-Prairie River\\". The Lonq Prairie River played a vital role in the early settlement pattern of Todd County. History describes the Long Prairie River valley as a hunting ground for the Dakota and Anishinaabe/Ojibwa, with the river itself providing a transportation link with the Crow Wing and Mississippi. Starting as early as the 1840s the river and its grass-filled valley were where the settlers first established themselves. By the mid-1860s several settlements from the present site of Long Prairie to Motley were prospering, using flatboats, and for a very short time even a steamboat, for transportation and shipping. By 1877 the water level had fallen to a point that only very small watercraft could navigate the river on a regular basis. In late 1877 H.D. Orendorf cut a road down the west side of the river from Turtle Creek to Motley. For many years this was the only road down the river valley. Some of the villages that grew up along the length of the Long Prairie have prospered, while some have disappeared completely. Hartford, on the banks of the river, opposite the mouth of Eagle Creek, was settled in 1865 by John Bassett, who was attracted to the area by the open grasslands north of the river. The railroad brought about the demise of Hartford when they built on the west side of the river, the community migrated to it and became what is now known as Browerville. Long Prairie was never a river town like Hartford. In the 1840s it was settled as the administrative headquarters for carrying out the agreement between the U.S. government and the Winnebago (now Ho-Chunk) Indians. The settlement developed along Venewitz Creek and was said to be more populous than St. Paul at that time. In 1855 the Winnebago had been moved to a reservation in Blue Earth County in southern Minnesota, and the lands were sold to investors from Ohio. The settlement was abandoned during the 1862 Dakota uprising. The area was slowly repopulated by settlers passing through the area who stayed, in many cases, because of the availability of the already constructed buildings and homes. At the end of the Civil War the communities west of Long Prairie were settled by Southern soldiers who had fought for the Union Army that were not very welcome in their home state of Kentucky. Once located at the present intersection of County Roads 38 and 11, Whiteville was settled by the three White sisters and their families. Clotho was settled where it is because, it seems, settlers couldn't go any further given that the forests and swamps to the west were impenetrable. At the time of Todd County's original European settlement, the forested areas of the Long Prairie River watershed were substantial. The Marshner Pre-European Settlement Vegetation Map shows that 65.5% of the area was covered by a variety of hardwoods and pines. The first commercial logging began about 1866 and continued through the mid-1890s. Eagle, Moran, Fish Trap, and Turtle creeks were all large enough, at that time, to power mills and float logs to the Long Prairie River where they joined other log rafts on their way to the Crow Wing and to the Mississippi. As most of the trees were harvested, the sandy soils in these areas were left unprotected, increasing erosion, and gradually filling the streams with sediment. The result is the very much smaller streams we have today. The 1990s Land Use map shows only 21% of the area forested, much restored due to reforestation plantings, and over 60% of the area as cultivated, hay, pasture or grassland. As the Long Prairie River watershed was settled, roads and railroads took over the job of transportation and shipping. Landowners used the river as a source of water for themselves, their livestock, and more recently, for irrigation. Industry located along the riverbanks and used the river as a source of water and as a discharge point for the waste materials generated by their companies. Few cities and villages used the river for drinking water, because the shallow sand aquifer along the river provided easy access to well water. Wastewater, however, was and still is discharged to the river and to Eagle Creek, one of the larger tributaries. Early irrigation used mostly surface water sources, primarily the Long Prairie River. In the dry years of the late 1970s, many irrigation systems were shut down at critical times because of low surface water levels. This action prompted most irrigators to change over to wells. To this day, irrigation systems are flourishing in the deep water-rich sands of the Long Prairie River Valley, but by 1994, only 14 surface water permits still existed in Todd County. Geography The headwaters of the Long Prairie River are in a region of numerous lakes north of Alexandria. It issues from Lake Carlos in Carlos Township in Douglas County, just south of Lake Carlos State Park and approximately north-northeast of Alexandria. Tributaries to Lake Carlos, which drain several lakes including Lake Darling, Lake Ida, Lake Miltona, and Geneva Lake, account for approximately a quarter of the Long Prairie River's watershed. The river initially flows eastwardly into Todd County; ditches in its upper course connect the river to Lake Osakis, which is the source of the Sauk River, thereby joining the two rivers' watersheds during periods of high water. At the city of Long Prairie the river turns north-northeastwardly, flowing past Browerville and through a state wildlife management area, into northwestern Morrison County, where it enters the Crow Wing River from the south in Motley Township, about a mile (2 km) southeast of Motley. Most of the river's watershed is within the North Central Hardwood Forest ecoregion, which is characterized by hardwood forests of maple and basswood mixed with conifers, on outwash plains and moraines amid flat glacial lakes. According to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, 41% of the Long Prairie River's watershed below Lake Carlos is used for agriculture; the main crops are potatoes, corn, soybeans and alfalfa. 24% of the watershed is grassland including pasture; 21% is forested; 10% is water or wetland; and 3% is urban or developed. Because the river's floodplain is wide and flat, land immediately adjacent to the river is predominantly agricultural or wetland. Agricultural use is not dominant along the upper (eastward) course of the river, which was historically covered by aspen and oak forest, wetlands, and tallgrass prairie; downstream of Browerville, farmland and second-growth forest are interspersed. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has identified the Long Prairie River as a route for canoeing. Fish species in the river include northern pike, walleye, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass. Flow rate At the United States Geological Survey's stream gauge in the city of Long Prairie, the annual mean flow of the river between 1972 and 2005 was 166 cubic feet per second (5 m¬≥/s). The highest recorded flow during the period was 3,270 ft¬≥/s (93 m¬≥/s) on July 22, 1972. The lowest recorded flow was 0.84 ft¬≥/s (0 m¬≥/s) on January 12, 1977.

Early years Tack was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and moved with his family to New York in 1883. After graduating from St. Francis Xavier College in New York City in 1890, Tack studied at the Art Students League of New York until 1895. He is believed to have frequented the studio of painter and stained glass designer John La Farge, whose portrait he painted around 1900. He had his first solo exhibition at the Kraushaar Galleries in New York City in 1896. The following year he moved to an artists‚Äô colony in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where he met and later married Agnes Gordon Fuller, daughter of artist George Fuller. Professional career Tack maintained a studio in New York from 1894 until the end of his life. He had frequent exhibitions at New York City galleries. From 1900 until the 1920s his work was shown regularly at the Worcester Art Museum, at the Carnegie International exhibitions in Pittsburgh, and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. He taught at the Art Students League of New York between 1906 and 1910 and at Yale University from 1910 to 1913. He also shared a studio with his friend, fellow artist Will Hutchins in Deerfield, Massachusetts during these teaching years. About 1914 to 1915 his work attracted the notice of Washington DC art collector and critic Duncan Phillips, who became his close friend and chief patron. Phillips and Tack also collaborated on the organization of the Allied War Salon of 1918. Tack died in 1949 in New York City.Biography from the Phillips collection. Style Tack's portraits and murals were traditional in style, but he also painted mystical semiabstract landscapes and abstract works on spiritual themes. These paintings, subjective and poetic explorations of nature that carried suggestions of timelessness and spirituality, were commercially unsuccessful. Time and Timelessness is an example, displaying Tack's style of contrasting the abstract qualities of his work with figurative aspects, in this case clouds. The painting is considered \\"a contemporary reworking of nineteenth- century heroic idealism\\".Extensive description from the Phillips Collection. Though Tack continued to paint conventional portraits and classically inspired murals for the remainder of his career, his most original achievements remain his semiabstract landscape paintings, many of which were inspired by photographs of the landscape of the American West. These were executed almost exclusively for Phillips. From 1941 on, Tack maintained a studio in Washington, DC., where he produced portraits of political and military leaders, including Eisenhower and Truman, while he continued to paint his poetic abstractions. While Tack's abstractions in The Phillips Collection resemble the paintings of Clyfford Still and other better known Abstract expressionist painters they are largely unknown; he is considered an important if only a minor forerunner to American Abstract expressionism. The Brooklyn Museum of Art, Harvard University Art Museums, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, The Phillips Collection, Washington DC and the Telfair Museum of Art, (Georgia) are among the public collections holding works by Augustus Vincent Tack.

On 20 September 1993 HMS Invincible hosted unsuccessful Warring Parties Peace Talks, hosted by Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenborg. In April 1994 a Sea Harrier was shot down on a mission near Gorazde; the pilot ejected safely and was recovered UNPROFOR deployments in October 1995. Operation Grapple was the codeword used to cover UK defence operations in support of the UN peacekeeping missions in the former Yugoslavia (authorised by UNSCR 776 of September 1992); including the deployment of British forces in Bosnia and Croatia from October 1992 until December 1995 as part of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). UNPROFOR would eventually hand over the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia to NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR) in winter 1995. The British participation in the IFOR was called Operation Resolute; the whole NATO mission was called Operation Joint Endeavour. The IFOR mission would last approximately a year, before it transitioned to the follow-on Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (SFOR). The United Kingdom originally deployed a compact army headquarters staff (commanded by a brigadier) - based in a former JNA barracks at Divulje near Split. The main manoeuvre forces were an infantry battle group (based in Bosnia); supported by an armoured reconnaissance squadron, a combat engineer squadron and a logistics support unit. A detachment of Fleet Air Arm Sea King troop carrying helicopters was also based in Divulje barracks (found from 845 and 846 Naval Air Squadrons). Some of the British unit locations were very isolated with only small amounts of security such as the Royal Engineers base at Camp Redoubt on a particularly hilly part of the main supply route to Vitez. The British contribution to UNPROFOR also included the deployment of Royal Navy ships sailing in the Adriatic Sea and RAF aircraft supporting troop movements in Croatia. This force would be increased in size over the course of the UN peacekeeping mandate in the Former Yugoslavia up until August 1995 when the British force was steadily drawn down. The UK agreed to join the UN force to protect humanitarian convoys in Bosnia, as part of UNPROFOR 2. The first British Battalion (BRITBAT) was the Cheshire Regiment which deployed with its armoured vehicles in October 1992 through the Croatian port of Split, eventually headquartering itself in a school on the outskirts of the town of Vitez in the La≈°va Valley. The battalion would have operating bases in Gornji Vakuf and Tuzla; and there was also a British logistics base at Tomislavgrad. The British contingent was expanded with the addition of another battalion group in March 1994. The first BRITBAT's time in Bosnia was not without controversy and its commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Bob Stewart very publicly lost his composure and impartiality after his unit discovered the remains of Muslim civilians who had been massacred by Croats in the village of Ahmiƒái in April 1993. British units took casualties from the outset and Lance Corporal Wayne Edwards, a Warrior tracked armoured vehicle driver, was shot and killed by a sniper, whilst driving his vehicle in Gornji Vakuf on 13 January 1993. Others would also sadly lose their lives; such as Private Shaun Taylor mortally wounded on 26 June 1994 near Gora≈æde. British armed forces would serve nearly 15 years in Bosnia and would see more than 50 comrades killed and many more wounded. Even more tragically it was Bosnia and Croatia's appalling road and weather conditions that caused many of the deaths and injuries. BRITBAT and its supporting sub-units would win praise by becoming the guardians of the only functioning main supply route into the core of Bosnia and ultimately Sarajevo and Tuzla, the maintenance of Routes Triangle and Diamond would remain a critical combat engineering task.

It is located in the Dutch province of North Brabant, largely within the municipality of Breda with some rural areas in the municipality of Alphen-Chaam. Bavel has a population of around 8,300 , the majority of the inhabitants live in the village itself, and some 590 in the surrounding countryside, including the hamlets of Roosberg, Eikberg, Bolberg, Tervoort, Lijndonk and Lage Aard. History Bavel is first mentioned in 1299, in a document dealing with the distribution of the revenues in the parish of Gilze, of which Bavel was a part at that time, and the rights of the Abbey in Thorn, the owners of the area, to collect one tenth of the harvest, called \\"tienden\\". The streets \\"Tiendweg\\" and \\"Abdij van Thornstraat\\" in Bavel bear witness to this historical connection. In 1316 Bavel was separated from the parish of Gilze and gets its own church, devoted to St. Brigida. After the 80-years war in 1648, Catholicism became banned, and the church fell to the Protestants. The catholic population improvised a catholic church in the hamlet of IJpelaar (today part of the city of Breda) until 1743, in which year they build a new church, presumably at the \\"Kerkeind\\". In 1809, the French king Lodewijk Napoleon returned the original church back to the catholic population. In this time, a French \\"telegraphe\\" was installed on the tower of the church, to convey messages fast from Paris to Amsterdam. In 1887 a new church building, located roughly opposite the street of the old one, devoted to the Assumption of Mary was taken into use, and is still in use. The location of the old church is now the a graveyard, and the little chapel is constructed from material of the old church.Assumption of Mary Church in Bavel, built in 1887 Until 1942 Bavel was part of the municipality of Ginneken en Bavel. In that year the city of Breda annexed Ginneken and what remained of the old borough became Nieuw-Ginneken. In 1997 the municipality of Nieuw Ginneken ceased to exist after the population centres on the border to Breda were annexed by this city. In the period 2003-2006, a new residential area along the former borderline between the city of Breda and Nieuw-Ginneken was established (Nieuw Wolfslaar). The city had also planned to construct a new village on at Lijndonk/Tervoort, but these plans have recently been cancelled.Breda past in hoog tempo bouwplannen aan (in Dutch) References External links * http://www.digitaalbavel.nl Bavel website, with pictures.

He moved to Graz at the age of 17 to become a student and often frequented the Mountainside Caf√©, a popular meeting place for chess players. As he already had a recognisable chess talent, he joined a local club 'SK Gemeinde' (Municipal chess club) and quickly advanced to master standard. A team player Becoming an International Master (IM) in 1957 and a Grandmaster in 1961, Robatsch dedicated much of his life to serving Austrian chess, representing the nation at eleven Chess Olympiads and one European Team Chess Championship. Up until his last Olympiad in 1994, he played first board on every occasion and returned some impressive results. At the 1960 Leipzig Olympiad, he astounded the chess world by scoring 84.4% and taking the board 1 gold medal, while still only an IM. This was also the year that he became Austrian champion. Tournament record While Robatsch played competitively over five decades, the high points of his international tournament career mostly occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was a winner at Madrid in 1961 (with Borislav Milic) and achieved outright or shared second place at Kapfenberg 1955, Varna 1957, Utrecht 1961 and Beverwijk 1962. At Halle in 1963, a zonal qualifying tournament for the world championship, he finished with a creditable tie for third (after Lajos Portisch and Bent Larsen, level with Borislav Ivkov). Later, he took a share of second place at Venice 1969, and placed third at Olot 1972, Costa Brava 1973 and Vienna 1979. He continued to play to a good standard into the late 1990s. Style and contributions to opening theory Robatsch displayed a highly combinative playing style in his younger days and adopted a more positional approach later in life. His opening play was often punctuated with experimental moves and this led to some lively and historically important games. The system of opening moves commencing 1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 (see diagram), first seen in the 16th century, became a playground that Robatsch returned to time and time again when he had the black pieces. Following preparatory moves such as Nc6 or d6, Black characteristically delays the development of the kingside knight in favour of an early challenge in the centre with e5. An alternative configuration, with which he drew with ex-world champion Max Euwe, involved playing an early c5 and d5. Other strategies employed by Black are likely to transpose to lines of the Pirc Defence, King's Indian Defence or Modern Benoni. Robatsch duly revived, developed and popularised the system and it became widely known as the 'Robatsch Defence' throughout the 1960s, 70s and even into the 1980s. The tenth edition of Modern Chess Openings (1965) grouped the Pirc and Robatsch together as the \\"Pirc‚ÄìRobatsch Defense\\". Although some opening books still reference it this way, a more common designation is the Modern Defence. He was also known for his offbeat version of the Centre Counter, or Scandinavian Defence as it is now best known. Parallel career Robatsch may have hindered his further development as a chess player, by sharing his love of chess with a parallel career in botany. As an esteemed orchidologist, he was awarded the title of 'Professor' for his outstanding research work in the classification of different species and sub-species of orchid. Karl Robatsch died in 2000, following a long fight with throat and stomach cancer.

Population details as taken at the 2011 Census can be found under Kingsley. Froghall sits in the Churnet Valley, a beautiful and relatively unspoilt part of Staffordshire. There are some excellent and challenging walks in the area, many of which encompass the area's historic development by the coal, ironstone, copper and limestone industries. Industry around Froghall For a relatively small village there has been a lot of historic development in and around Froghall by Industry over the last few hundred years. The main feature of the village is the historic copper factory of Thomas Bolton and sons, now called Bolton Copper. A lot of the factory stood derelict before being demolished in 2011. However, a last minute intervention saved an original chimney which is still standing. A ¬£10m shortfall in a pension scheme, an explosion and the loss of a main customer which accounted for 70 per cent of the order book led to the downfall of Thomas Bolton. Attempts to find a buyer for the 200-year-old copperworks in Staffordshire were unsuccessful resulting in redundancy of the majority of the 105 workers. Despite a strong level of interest shown in the Froghall business as a going concern, no deal was forthcoming and the factory was closed. The Thomas Bolton Copperworks at Froghall (and the closed works in the nearby village of Oakamoor) are famous for the world's first transatlantic telegraph cables, which were manufactured and rolled at the plants. During the Second World War the factories made wiring components for Spitfire fighter planes. The copper works are the Staffordshire Moorlands' last link to the historic copper-mining industry that was centered on the nearby Manifold Valley and its famous Ecton Copper Mines. The limestone industry was also significant in Froghall. At the nearby Froghall Wharf, limestone was loaded onto canal narrow boats or burnt in lime kilns and then transported to the Potteries or further afield. The limestone was mined in the huge quarries at Caldon Low and then loaded onto an inclined tramway to Froghall. Four tramways were built and parts of them are still tracable in the landscape including various bridges and inclines. The final tramway, built by James Trubshaw was the most significant and involved the most engineering. Trubshaw's tunnel near Windy Harbour is an excellent relic of this fourth route. The canal basin at Froghall Wharf is now a pleasant spot for pleasure craft and walkers, with the huge dormant lime kilns dominating the area. As mentioned above, the Caldon Canal has played a large part in the development of industry around Froghall. The basin at Froghall Wharf was originally the terminus of the Caldon Canal, and a separate branch then ran to Uttoxeter. The Uttoxeter Canal was opened to traffic in 1811 and after years of heavy losses was closed in 1849. The branch was then mostly filled in and a railway was built over most of the canal bed. Transport Froghall was formerly served by Kingsley and Froghall railway station, on the North Staffordshire Railway's Churnet Valley Line from North Rode to Uttoxeter via Leek. The line closed to passenger trains in the 1960s and completely closed to freight in 1988 with the transfer of the sand traffic from nearby Oakamoor to road haulage. Passenger trains returned to Froghall in the 1990s after preservation of the line by the Churnet Valley Railway. At the present time, Kingsley and Froghall is the terminus of the railway. The A52, which links Stoke-on-Trent with Derby, passes through Froghall. This historic road was used years ago to transport coal mined in Cheadle to Ashbourne, and until recently many older residents would refer to the road as the \\"Old Coal Road.\\" References External links Category:Villages in Staffordshire Category:Towns and villages of the Peak District Category:Lime kilns in the United Kingdom ","title":"Froghall"},{"id":"11814243","title":"Yoel Razvozov"},{"id":"11814257","title":"Daniel Fern√°ndez (judoka)"},{"id":"11814266","text":"The University of Santo Tomas Graduate School is the graduate school of the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest and largest Catholic university in Manila, Philippines.

This authority is created in order to, according to the long title of the act, \\"encourage local development to prevent conditions of unemployment and promote economic growth.\\" Powers entitled to such authorities include the issuance of municipal bonds and tax increment financing. There are five different methods in which a township may be designated an urban township by the state. Common requirements between all methods are a population requirement, which usually mandates that there be 20,000 residents in a township‚Äîthough that number can be as low as 10,000‚Äîand in one case, the population requirement is not on the township at all, but the county; the population of said county must be over 1,000,000.

They produced and published games for various formats, originally the Atari ST and Amiga platforms, and later for the Personal computer (PC), Game Boy Color and a few titles for the PlayStation. Perhaps their most successful venture was the Bundesliga Manager series, based on the German soccer premier league. They also produced a series of \\"Artventure\\" interactive fiction games, in the German language. In the mid-1990s they produced other spinoff manager games, including Eishockey Manager (Ice Hockey Manager) and the Pizza Syndicate series for the PC. They also developed the puzzle game Swing, released for the PlayStation in 1998. The company produced several titles with small development teams. This proved fatal with the rising standards of full priced games. With falling sales and important figures leaving the company, Software 2000 filed for bankruptcy in 2002.

Membership is open to anyone aged 18 or over: the term \\"gentlemen\\" in the title is historical ‚Äì there is no discrimination between men and women. Its Grade II listed museum in Broad Street, Spalding, was designed by Joseph Boothroyd Corby and opened in 1911; additions to the building ensued in 1925 and 1960.

Benjamin Ray, Perpetual Curate of Cowbit and Surfleet (elected a member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society in 1723), and a relative of the founder, Maurice Johnson The Spalding Gentlemen's Society started in 1710 with informal meetings of a few gentlemen at a local coffee house in Spalding called Youngers. Many gentlemen's clubs formed in this way around that time. They talked about local antiquities and discussed the popular London newspaper The Tatler. In 1712 the society was organised in a more formal way as a Society of Gentlemen, for the supporting of mutual benevolence, and their improvement in the liberal sciences and in polite learning. Officers were appointed and minutes were kept. Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch (1695‚Äì1751), became Patron in 1732. Records of the society's earliest activities have been published by the Lincoln Record Society as The Correspondence of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society, 1710‚Äì1761 and Minute-Books of The Spalding Gentlemen's Society, 1712‚Äì1755.

Automotive paint is paint used on automobiles for both protection and decoration purposes. Water-based acrylic polyurethane enamel paint is currently the most widely used paint for reasons including reducing paint's environmental impact. Modern automobile paint is applied in several layers, with a total thickness of around 100 ¬µm(0.1mm). Paint application requires preparation and primer steps to ensure proper application. A basecoat is applied after the primer paint is applied. Following this, a clearcoat of paint may be applied that forms a glossy and transparent coating. The clearcoat layer must be able to withstand UV light. History In the early days of the automobile industry, paint was applied manually and dried for weeks at room temperature because it was a single component paint that dried by solvent evaporation. As mass production of cars made the process untenable, paint began to be dried in ovens. Nowadays, two- component (catalyzed) paint is usually applied by robotic arms and cures in just a few hours either at room temperature or in heated booths. Until several decades ago lead, chromium and other heavy metals were used in automotive paint. Environmental laws have prohibited this, which has resulted in a move to water-based paints. Up to 85% of lacquer paint can evaporate into the air, polluting the atmosphere. Enamel paint is better for the environment and replaced lacquer paint in the late 20th century. Water-based acrylic polyurethane enamels are now almost universally used as the basecoat with a clearcoat. Processes and coatings =Preparation= High-pressure water spray jets are directed to the body. Without proper pretreatment, premature failure of the finish system can almost be guaranteed. A phosphate coat is necessary to protect the body against corrosion effects and prepares the surface for the E-Coat. The body is dipped into the Electro-Coat Paint Operation (ELPO/E-Coat), then a high voltage is applied. The body works as a cathode and the paint as an anode sticking on the body surface. It is an eco- friendly painting process. In E-Coat, also called CED paint, utilization is approximately 99.9% and provides superior salt spray resistance compared to other painting processes. thumbDown-to-metal ground paint: =Primer= The primer is the first coat to be applied. The primer serves several purposes. * It serves as a leveler, which is important since the cab often has marks and other forms of surface defect after being manufactured in the body shop. A smoother surface is created by leveling out these defects and therefore a better final product. * It protects the vehicle from corrosion, heat differences, bumps, stone-chips, UV-light, etc. * It improves ease of application by making it easier for paints to stick to the surface. Using a primer, a more varied range of paints can be used. =Base Coat= The base coat is applied after the primer coat. This coat contains the visual properties of color and effects, and is usually the one referred to as the paint. Base coat used in automotive applications is commonly divided into three categories: solid, metallic, and pearlescent pigments. *Solid paints have no sparkle effects except the color. This is the easiest type of paint to apply, and the most common type of paint for heavy transportation vehicles, construction equipment and aircraft. It is also widely used on cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Clear coat was not used on solid colors until the early 1990s. *Metallic paints contain aluminium flakes to create a sparkling and grainy effect, generally referred to as a metallic look. This paint is harder to manage than solid paints because of the extra dimensions to consider. Metallic and pearlescent paints must be applied evenly to ensure a consistent looking finish without light and dark spots which are often called \\"mottling\\". Metallic basecoats are formulated so that the aluminium flake is parallel to the substrate. This maximises the \\"flop\\". This is the difference in the brightness between looking perpendicularly at the paint and that at an acute angle. The \\"flop\\" is maximised if the basecoat increases in viscosity shortly after application so that the aluminium flake which is in a random orientation after spraying is locked into this position while there is still much solvent (or water) in the coating. Subsequent evaporation of the solvent (or water), leads to a reduction in the film thickness of the drying coating, causing the aluminium flake to be dragged into an orientation parallel to the substrate. This orientation then needs to be unaffected by the application of the clear coat solvents. The formulation of the clear coat needs to be carefully chosen so that it will not \\"re-dissolve\\" the basecoat and thus affect the orientation of the metallic flake but will still exhibit enough adhesion between the coatings so as to avoid delamination of the clear coat. A similar mode of action occurs with pearlescent pigmented basecoats. *Pearlescent paints contain special iridescent pigments commonly referred to as \\"pearls\\". Pearl pigments impart a colored sparkle to the finish which works to create depth of color. Pearlescent paints can be two stage in nature (pearl base color + clear) or 3 stage in nature (basecoat + pearl mid-coat + clear-coat).A Guide to Auto Paint Colors =Clearcoat= Usually sprayed on top of a colored basecoat, clearcoat is a glossy and transparent coating that forms the final interface with the environment. For this reason, clearcoat must be durable enough to resist abrasion and chemically stable enough to withstand UV light. Clearcoat can be either solvent or water-borne.DuPont Automotive: Paint & Coatings for Metal Exterior One part and two part formulations are often referred to as \\"1K\\" and \\"2K\\" respectively.1K Coating vs 2K Coatings Car manufacturer (OEM) clear coats applied to the metal bodies of cars are normally 1K systems since they can be heated to around 140 ¬∞C to effect cure. The clear coats applied to the plastic components like the bumpers and wing mirrors however are 2K systems since they can normally only accept temperatures up to about 90 ¬∞C. These 2K systems are normally applied \\"off line\\" with the coated plastic parts fixed to the painted metallic body. Owing to the difference in formulation of the 1K and 2K systems and the fact they are coated in different locations they have a different effect on the \\"redissolving\\" of the metallic base coat. This is most easily seen in the light metallic paints like the silver and light blue or green shades where the \\"flop\\" difference is most marked. Terminology The terminology for automotive paints has been driven by the progression of technologies and by the desire to both distinguish new technologies and relate to previous technologies for the same purpose. Modern car paints are nearly always an acrylic polyurethane \\"enamel\\" with a pigmented basecoat and a clear topcoat. It may be described as \\"acrylic\\", \\"acrylic enamel\\", \\"urethane\\", etc. and the clearcoat in particular may be described as a lacquer. True lacquers and acrylic lacquers are obsolete, and plain acrylic enamels have largely been superseded by better-performing paints. True enamel is not an automotive paint. The term is common for any tough glossy paint but its use in the automotive industry is often restricted to older paints before the introduction of polyurethane hardeners.  Types & Form  Innovations are taking place in paint industry as well. These days, automotive paints come in liquid form, spray form, and powder forms:- * Liquid: Usually polyurethane paints. Compressor is needed to apply. * Spray: This is as same as perfume in spray bottle. Made for DIYer. * Powder or additive: Paints in powder form applied after mixing in paint thinner. Types of Automotive Paints * Removable: These kinds of paints are made for giving custom appearance to vehicle. * Non- removable: Made for touch-ups and painting vehicle.

It is also known as Old-man's Beard and Yerba de Chiva, and Virgin's bower, (though Old-man's Beard may also refer to C. vitalba, and Virgin's bower may also refer to C. lasiantha). It is native to North America where it is widespread across the western United States in streamside thickets, wooded hillsides, and coniferous forests up to 8,500 feet (2,600 m). It was called \\"pepper vine\\" by early travelers and pioneers of the American Old West. They used it as a pepper substitute to spice up food since real black pepper (Piper nigrum) was a costly and rarely obtainable spice. Like the rest of the genus Clematis, it contains essential oils and compounds which are extremely irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Unlike Black Pepper or Capsicum, however, the compounds in clematis cause internal bleeding of the digestive tract if ingested internally in large amounts. The plants are essentially toxic. Native Americans used very small amounts of clematis for migraine headaches and nervous disorders. It was also used as an effective treatment of skin infections. A whole-plant hot water extraction was used to treat eczema, and a leaf compress is used to treat chest pain, sores, and boils.

Definition The center of a monoidal category \\\\mathcal{C} = (\\\\mathcal{C},\\\\otimes,I), denoted \\\\mathcal{Z(C)}, is the category whose objects are pairs (A,u) consisting of an object A of \\\\mathcal{C} and an isomorphism u_X:A \\\\otimes X \\\\rightarrow X \\\\otimes A which is natural in X satisfying : u_{X \\\\otimes Y} = (1 \\\\otimes u_Y)(u_X \\\\otimes 1) and : u_I = 1_A (this is actually a consequence of the first axiom). An arrow from (A,u) to (B,v) in \\\\mathcal{Z(C)} consists of an arrow f:A \\\\rightarrow B in \\\\mathcal{C} such that :v_X (f \\\\otimes 1_X) = (1_X \\\\otimes f) u_X. This definition of the center appears in . Equivalently, the center may be defined as :\\\\mathcal Z(\\\\mathcal C) = \\\\mathrm{End}_{\\\\mathcal C \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal C^{op}}(\\\\mathcal C), i.e., the endofunctors of C which are compatible with the left and right action of C on itself given by the tensor product. =Braiding= The category \\\\mathcal{Z(C)} becomes a braided monoidal category with the tensor product on objects defined as :(A,u) \\\\otimes (B,v) = (A \\\\otimes B,w) where w_X = (u_X \\\\otimes 1)(1 \\\\otimes v_X), and the obvious braiding. =Higher categorical version= The categorical center is particularly useful in the context of higher categories. This is illustrated by the following example: the center of the (abelian) category \\\\mathrm{Mod}_R of R-modules, for a commutative ring R, is \\\\mathrm{Mod}_R again. The center of a monoidal ‚àû-category C can be defined, analogously to the above, as :Z(\\\\mathcal C) := \\\\mathrm{End}_{\\\\mathcal C \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal C^{op}}(\\\\mathcal C). Now, in contrast to the above, the center of the derived category of R-modules (regarded as an ‚àû-category) is given by the derived category of modules over the cochain complex encoding the Hochschild cohomology, a complex whose degree 0 term is R (as in the abelian situation above), but includes higher terms such as Hom(R, R) (derived Hom). The notion of a center in this generality is developed by . Extending the above-mentioned braiding on the center of an ordinary monoidal category, the center of a monoidal ‚àû-category becomes an E_2-monoidal category. More generally, the center of a E_k-monoidal category is an algebra object in E_k-monoidal categories and therefore, by Dunn additivity, an E_{k+1}-monoidal category. Examples has shown that the Drinfeld center of the category of sheaves on an orbifold X is the category of sheaves on the inertia orbifold of X. For X being the classifying space of a finite group G, the inertia orbifold is the stack quotient G/G, where G acts on itself by conjugation. For this special case, Hinich's result specializes to the assertion that the center of the category of G-representations (with respect to some ground field k) is equivalent to the category consisting of G-graded k-vector spaces, i.e., objects of the form :\\\\bigoplus_{g \\\\in G} V_g for some k-vector spaces, together with G-equivariant morphisms, where G acts on itself by conjugation. In the same vein, have shown that Drinfeld center of the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a perfect stack X is the derived category of sheaves on the loop stack of X. Related notions =Centers of monoid objects= The center of a monoid and the Drinfeld center of a monoidal category are both instances of the following more general concept. Given a monoidal category C and a monoid object A in C, the center of A is defined as :Z(A) = End_{A \\\\otimes A^{op}}(A). For C being the category of sets (with the usual cartesian product), a monoid object is simply a monoid, and Z(A) is the center of the monoid. Similarly, if C is the category of abelian groups, monoid objects are rings, and the above recovers the center of a ring. Finally, if C is the category of categories, with the product as the monoidal operation, monoid objects in C are monoidal categories, and the above recovers the Drinfeld center. =Categorical trace= The categorical trace of a monoidal category (or monoidal ‚àû-category) is defined as :Tr(C) := C \\\\otimes_{C \\\\otimes C^{op}} C.

It was a protest by eight demonstrators against the invasion of Czechoslovakia on the night of 20‚Äì21 August 1968 by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies, crushing the Prague Spring, the challenge to centralised planning and censorship by Communist leader Alexander Dubƒçek. The protest took place at the Lobnoye Mesto (Place of Proclamation) on Red Square next to the Kremlin, to avoid any accusation of a violation of public order. It was a non-violent, sit-down demonstration. However, all but one of the protestors was quickly and roughly arrested by police and plainclothes KGB men. The protest, 25 August The protest began at noon as eight protesters (Larisa Bogoraz, Konstantin Babitsky, Vadim Delaunay, Vladimir Dremliuga, Pavel Litvinov, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Viktor Fainberg, and Tatiana Baeva) sat at the Lobnoye Mesto and held a small Czechoslovak flag and placards bearing various slogans: * \\"We are losing our best friends\\" (\\"–º—ã —Ç–µ—Ä—è–µ–º –ª—É—á—à–∏—Ö –¥—Ä—É–∑–µ–π\\"), * \\"A≈• ≈æije svobodn√© a nez√°visl√© ƒåeskoslovensko!\\" (Long live free and independent Czechoslovakia), * \\"Shame to the occupiers\\" (\\"–ü–æ–∑–æ—Ä –æ–∫–∫—É–ø–∞–Ω—Ç–∞–º!\\"), * \\"Hands off the ƒåSSR\\" (\\"–†—É–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—á—å –æ—Ç –ß–°–°–†!\\"), * \\"For your freedom and ours\\" (\\"–ó–∞ –≤–∞—à—É –∏ –Ω–∞—à—É —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—É!\\"), * \\"Freedom for Dubƒçek\\" (\\"–°–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—É –î—É–±—á–µ–∫—É!\\"). Within a few minutes, seven of the protesters were assaulted, brutally beaten and loaded into cars by KGB operatives. The Czechoslovak flag was broken, and the placards were confiscated. Since Natalya Gorbanevskaya had recently given birth, she was not made to stand trial. The other protesters convinced 21-year-old Tatiana Baeva to declare that she had been at the scene by accident, and she was released soon after. The KGB failed to find out which protester was holding which banner; therefore, all the banners were attributed to each protester, except for Tatiana Baeva, who was released.

However, several sources deny, doubt or ignore that he was a monk. He was involved in the aftermath of the Paris disputation of 1240, and subsequent condemnation of the Talmud. After the disputation a tribunal was appointed to pass judgment upon the Talmud, among its members being Eudes de Chateauroux, Chancellor of the University of Paris; Guillaume d'Auvergne, Bishop of Paris; and the Inquisitor Henri de Cologne. After the same rabbis had been heard a second time, the Talmud was condemned to be burned. Two years after (in the middle of 1242) twenty-four cartloads of Hebrew books were burned at Paris. [...] A little later, while at Lyons, the pope listened to the complaints of the Jews, and in 1247 he asked Eudes de Chateauroux to examine the Talmud from the Jewish standpoint, and to ascertain whether it might not be tolerated as harmless to the Christian faith, and whether the copies which had been confiscated might not be returned to their owners. The rabbis had represented to him that without the aid of the Talmud they could not understand the Bible or the rest of their statutes. Eudes informed the pope that the change of attitude involved in such a decision would be wrongly interpreted, and on 15 May 1248 the Talmud was condemned for the second time. A long list of supposed \\"errors and blasphemies\\" contained the Talmud was compiled by Eudes de Chateauroux.http://www.revistamirabilia.com/Numeros/Num5/art5.htm He was made cardinal-bishop of Frascati (1244). He is given also as bishop of Toulouse and bishop of Maguelonne and legate, and was sent to preach crusade in France by Pope Innocent IV.Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades III p. 256. He accompanied Louis IX of France on the Seventh Crusade, and is mentioned by Joinville, returning in 1254, via Cyprus. Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals from December 1254 and Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church in 1270.

The island itself is reasonably small in size, about in length with a total area of . History The island was being used by settlers to graze sheep and collect wood since before 1896 with goods being transported to Esperance for sale. Sheep continued to be grazed on the island until 1954 when the Recherche Archipelago was declared a Nature Reserve. Woody Island is the only island of the archipelago that is open to visitors, it is accessible by daily island cruises and has accommodation available. Tour operator, Dan MacKenzie, was granted permission to land passengers on the island in 1973. The MacKenzie family built the jetty on the island that is still used for visitors to disembark from tourist boats. A license to operate overnight tourism on Woody Island was granted to the MacKenzies in 1985. A 500,000 visitor centre was opened on the island in 1999. Over 16,000 tourists visit the island each year. Facilities Facilities on the island include an interpretive centre, a cafe, a swimming platform with a slide and a snorkelling trail. Woody Island received over 16,000 visitors in 2003/2004. Flora The name of the island is derived from all of the trees that grow there. The island has a diverse flora for its size with 7 species of carnations and sedges, 20 species of daises, 12 grass species, 11 myrtle species, 9 species of peas and wattles, 4 species of trigger plants, 3 saltbush species of saltbush and 2 species of hakeas.

Platform 2 Rebuild During the station's heyday, Cranmore originally had two platforms, but with the closure in 1960s, the site became derelict. Platform 2 was demolished and was not rebuilt as part of the ESR's restoration at the time. However, with preserved traffic increasing (and as platform 1 is sometimes overcrowded during special events), the ESR does aim to rebuild the long-demolished platform 2, to reduce congestion and relieve Cranmore station). In April 2018, the ESR announced it had received ¬£46,500 through National Lottery support, as part of a new upcoming project, aiming to rebuild and resurrect the down platform 2 along with its waiting room, which will be developed as an educational and interpretation centre, enabling volunteers and staff of the ESR to learn new skills and to display the rich history associated with the preserved line itself. Following the completion of this first phase it was announced in mid 2019 that the ESR had received a further grant of ¬£58,700 from the National Lottery Fund to finish the second \\"down\\" platform and complete other works at Cranmore station.This was largely completed at the start of 2020 with the whole platform being constructed and surfaced.

Lifeways and material culture The Ortoiroid were hunter- gatherers. Shellfish remains have been found at Ortoitoid sites indicating that they constituted an important part of the diet. This diet also included turtles, crabs, and fish. They were known for their lithic technology but did not have ceramics. Ortoiroid artifacts include bone spearpoints, perforated animal teeth worn as jewelry, and stone tools, such as manos and metates, net sinkers, pestles, choppers, hammerstones, and pebbles used for grinding. Ortoiroid people lived in caves and in the open. They buried their dead in soil beneath shell middens. Red ochre was found at some sites and may have been used for body paint.\\"Rewriting History: There were people before the Caribs and Arawaks .\\" Trinidad and Tobago Express via Archaeology Daily News. 4 February 2010 (retrieved 9 July 2011). Decline The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid people in the West Indies. In many regions, they disappeared by approximately 400 BCE; however, the Coroso culture survived until 200 CE.

As Steaua is, judging by performances, the most successful Romanian football team, they enjoy the biggest support among Romanian football fans. A survey conducted in 2004 suggested that the Ghencea-based team accounts for approximately 42% of all Romanian football lovers, meaning about five million fans inside and outside Romania's borders. This large number of supporters is in large part to the club's outstanding performances, both domestically and internationally. After FCSB lost the name and the crest, the fans have divided into two groups, some fans support CSA Steaua founded in 1947 rather than FCSB(the team recognized by UEFA and FRF to be the original team founded in 2003), while other prominent groups remain undecided over the issue.  History  = The Old Days (1947‚Äì1995) = However, at the beginning, being the club of the Romanian Army, Steaua drew its supporters mostly from people linked with the Army. The first waves of new fans came at the beginning of the 1950s, when CCA's legendary golden team won the hearts of many people delighted by their spectacular play. It was not until 1974 with the erection of Stadionul Ghencea in south-western Bucharest that the Steaua zones of supporters came to standardize themselves in the regions adjacent to the arena, subsequently covering the whole southern half of Bucharest, a city geographically divided by the D√¢mbovi»õa River. 1986 is the year when Steaua began to become the most beloved club in the country. The extraordinary success in the European Cup of a fantastic team that was to remain among Europe's finest for another three years turned everyone's attention to the red and blues. Steaua is leader in fan support with 42% population of country. = Armata Ultra' (1995‚Äì2001) = The Steaua Ultras movement began on 4 December 1995, when the bases of Armata Ultra (AU), the first Ultras group in Bucharest (and the second in Romania), were set. For years, AU dominated the Ultra movement in Romania. It quickly reached an impressive number of 4,000 members, a record which stands up to this day for supporter groups in the country. Basically they adopted a far-right Steaua ideologyAngelescu, Dumitru, NƒÉscu»õi asasini, ProSport Magazin, 28/1998, p.12-15 with very strict internal rules, both inside and outside matches, such as no smoking, no eating, no drinking, no sitting, only standing and chanting. They stood out by their high number of membres, the big crowds dispatched to away games, chant power and trouble making, as AU had important hooligan influences. Many saw the disappearance of AU as something like the death of a legend. This occurred in 2001, due to internal problems, when smaller groups appeared, such as Gruppo Apparte and Brigada XXL which, in some manner, identified themselves with AU and gradually messed with their policy, style and way of life. These intrusions culminated with a conflict of their leader, Jean Pavel, with the Steaua Board of Administration. Even though extinct, Armata Ultra's spirit still lives on in most Steaua fans and a great lot of them still identify themselves with AU, as it probably was the strongest, most important ever Ultra group in Romania. = Peluza Nord and Peluza Sud Era (2001‚Äì2014) = From around 2001 to 2014, Steaua's supporters were not led by a single group. The tendency was to form several small groups who played their own part. The most important part of them were located in the Peluza Nord (North End), some others taking their place in the Peluza Sud (South End). Because of different attitudes towards the team and the game (PS were usually tougher and more severe in which regards the game and often not so patient), there were sometimes conflicts between how the team should be supported. The groups at the PS (Ultras, Glas, Vacarm, Stil Ostil, Banda Ultra, South Boys, Era, Outlaws, Hunters,RoosterS',Tineretului Korp,Shadows 08 ) even officially ceased activity for a while because of conflicts like these with the more numerous PN. Groups inside Peluza Nord included, Titan Boys, Nucleo, Gruppo Tei, Skins Berceni, Insurgen»õii, Armata 47, Ultras Colentina, Gruppo Voluntari Est. It was rather difficult to assign Steaua's Peluza Nord and Peluza Sud fans a certain style. They could have been described by the typical Italian style, common in different respects to all Romanian groups of fans, with lots of choreographies, banners, flags, doubleholders and flags swinging in the air but on the other hand still had serious Hooligan influences existent from the defunct Armata Ultra' era. Therefore, they mostly resembled the West-European style, typical for fans such as those of AFC Ajax, Paris Saint-Germain FC, BV Borussia Dortmund, etc. Since Steaua were dropped to the 4th division in 2016, both Peluza Sud and Peluza Nord attend matches at Ghencea training ground and away fixtures, however most groups from Peluza Nord disbanded and the ones that remained joined Peluza Sud to form only one single Peluza. As soon as the leader of the Skins Berceni group came out of prison, some fans of Peluza Nord returned to support the team in Liga I, FCSB. So far the groups are: Insurgentii, Skins Berceni and Tornado'47.  AISS  More recently, as up 2006, the supporters have formed their own official supporters' association, following the example of most European clubs. Asocia»õia IndependentƒÉ a Suporterilor Steli»ôti (AISS; Steaua Supporters' Independent Association) was formed as a legal entity with its stated goals of 'protecting the interests and image of Steaua supporters', as well as 'identifying and promoting the club's perennial values'. Gradually aiming for multiplying its members, AISS has involved itself so far in several actions as celebrating the club's 60 years of existence and a general campaign to protect the club's image against a certain negative influence of main investor George Becali over its historical tradition and values.  Fans Outside Romania  There are also groups of Steaua fans outside Romania. For example, the SUD 2009, a group of German Steaua fans, and \\"GRUPPO CHISINAU\\".  Racism  The issue has lately generated several incidents and fights between factions of supporters of Steaua and Rapid, some of them causing pitch suspensions and even being minutes away from provoking match suspensions. Stadionul Ghencea has been targeted by UEFA in 2005, as a result of certain racist behaviours of some of the fans during a UEFA Champions League qualifying match against Shelbourne FC. The pitch was suspended for one match. Pitch suspensions have actually been the key-word for Steaua and its fans during the last three seasons, as no more than 10 Liga I matchday suspensions (with one more to go in the next season) and one in the UEFA Cup have been dictated and cumulated against and by the Ghencea-based club.  Friendships and influence  As Steaua is the most popular club in Romania, there are, besides Bucharest, several cities counting a great majority of red and blue supporters among football lovers. Widely speaking, these cities are predominant in the Eastern half of the country, particularly in the regions of Moldavia, Greater Wallachia and Northern Dobruja. Cities such as Suceava, Piatra Neam»õ, BacƒÉu, Gala»õi (inside Moldavia), Constan»õa (Northern Dobruja), BuzƒÉu, BrƒÉila, T√¢rgovi»ôte, CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi (Greater Wallachia), R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea, T√¢rgu Jiu (Oltenia), Bra»ôov, Oradea, Sibiu, T√¢rgu Mure»ô or Petro»ôani (Transylvania) enjoy a great majority of Steaua fans which are often well-received even by fans of the local teams. The club is also popular outside the borders, notably between Romanian emigrants. The Valencian Community in Spain accounts for an important number of supporters, being the most important area for this matter. Steaua fans are also maintaining good relations with the fans of CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria, with whom they share the common root of once representing the teams of their national armies. The bases of these relations date from a UEFA Cup encounter in 2004 between the two clubs. Some ultras are also friends with the ultras from UTA Arad, Corvinul Hunedoara, Farul Constan»õa, NEC Nijmegen, PAOK FC, CSKA Moscow and Partizan Belgrade. Also, European encounters against Panathinaikos in 1998 and Slavia Praha in 1999 were premises for setting contacts with rival fans of Olympiacos of Greece and Sparta Prague of Czech Republic respectively.  Rivalries  = Rivalry with Dinamo = Steaua fans during a 2012 match with Dinamo. Steaua against FC Dinamo Bucure»ôti has been the leading Romanian football derby in the last 60 years, as Steaua and Dinamo are the two most successful football teams in the country. It has also been and still is a match between the former clubs of the Romanian Army (Steaua) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Dinamo). Not once have there been famous clashes between different factions of supporters of them, in the streets as well as inside the stadium. The heyday was reached before a match kick-off in 1997, when Dinamo fans set a sector of Ghencea Stadium's South End (where they were assigned) on fire. Between October 1991 and April 2000, Steaua enjoyed their moment of glory, counting 19 undefeated official matches in front of their rivals, both in the championship and the cup. Rivalry with Dinamo also extends to other sports such as handball, rugby union and water polo. = Rivalry with Rapid = The second rivalry is with FC Rapid Bucure»ôti. Several matches in the last years between Steaua and Rapid have ended in serious clashes between fans Rivalry has become even fiercer since Steaua outpassed Rapid in an all-Romanian UEFA Cup quarter final in 2006. = Other rivalries = Milder and historical rivalries are also with non-Bucharest teams such as Universitatea Craiova, Politehnica Timi»ôoara, CFR Cluj, Universitatea Cluj and Petrolul Ploie»ôti. Notable is also a non-football rivalry with SC Miercurea Ciuc, Steaua's biggest rival inside the national ice hockey competition. Besides the sporting rivalry, this dispute also stems from at ethnic issue, as SC Miercurea Ciuc represents the former Hungarian Autonomous Province, whose inhabitants, mainly Hungarian, are seen as separatists.

He was one of the first British artists to experiment with machine-generated visual effects at the time of the emerging global computer art movement of the 1960s (The Cambridge Encyclopaedia 1990 p. 289; Levy 2006 pp. 178‚Äì180). During this period, Henry constructed a succession of three drawing machines from modified bombsight analogue computers which were employed in World War II bombers to calculate the accurate release of bombs onto their targets (O'Hanrahan 2005). Henry's machine-generated effects resemble complex versions of the abstract, curvilinear graphics which accompany Microsoft's Windows Media Player. Henry's machine-generated effects may therefore also be said to represent early examples of computer graphics: \\"the making of line drawings with the aid of computers and drawing machines\\". (Franke 1971, p. 41) During the 1970s Henry focussed on further developing his own unique photo-chemical techniques for the production of original visual effects. He went on to make a fourth and a fifth drawing machine in 1984 and 2002 respectively. These later machines however, were based on a mechanical pendulum design and not bombsight computers. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Artistic career It was thanks to artist L. S. Lowry, working in collaboration with the then director of Salford Art Gallery, A. Frape, that Henry's artistic career was launched in 1961 when he won a local competition at Salford Art gallery, entitled London Opportunity. The prize for winning this competition was a one-man exhibition show in London at the Reid Gallery. Lowry knew how crucial such a London show could be in bringing an artist to public attention. As one of the competition judges, Lowry visited Henry's home in Burford Drive, Manchester, to view his range of artistic work. (O'Hanrahan 2005) It was at this London show of 1962, entitled Ideographs, that Henry's machine-generated effects were exhibited for the first time, along with pictures based upon Henry's photo-chemical techniques which had originally won him the competition prize. (O'Hanrahan 2005) It was this first exhibition of machine-produced effects which led to Henry and his first drawing machine being included in the first ever programme in the BBC's North at Six series and to his being approached by the American magazine Life. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Henry and his first drawing machine were to be featured in this magazine, but the article was scrapped following the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy. The generally positive response his pictures received reflects the zeitgeist of technological optimism of the 1960s. (O'Hanrahan 2005) The Guardian of 17/9/62 described the images produced by this first machine as being \\"quite out of this world\\" and \\"almost impossible to produce by human hands\\". Henry's machine-generated effects went on to be exhibited at various venues during the 1960s, the most major being Cybernetic Serendipity (1968) held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (I.C.A) in London. This represented one of the most significant art and technology exhibitions of the decade. (Goodman 1987) In this exhibition not only the effects but also the drawing machine itself was included as an interactive exhibit. Cybernetic Serendipity then went on to tour the United States, where exhibition venues included the Corcoran Gallery in Washington and San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts. (O'Hanrahan 2005) This second machine returned from its tour of the United States in 1972 in a complete state of disrepair. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Such technical failures were not unusual in electric and motor-driven exhibition items. (Rosenburg 1972) More recently, frequent mechanical and/or electronic computer breakdowns contributed to the decision to close Artworks, (The Lowry, Salford Quays, Manchester, U.K) in March 2003 after only three years in operation as a permanent, technology-based, interactive exhibition. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Inspiration: the bombsight computer The main component of each Henry drawing machine was the bombsight computer. These mechanical analogue computers represented some of the most important technological advancements of World War Two. However, by the 1960s they already represented \\"old\\" technology when compared to the more modern digital computers then available. (O'Hanrahan 2005) The mechanical analogue bombsight computer was employed in World War Two bomber aircraft to determine the exact moment bombs were to be released to hit their target. The bombardier entered information on air and wind speed, wind direction, altitude, angle of drift and bomb weight into the computer which then calculated the bomb release point, using a complex arrangement of gyros, motors, gears and a telescope. (Jacobs 1996) It was in the early 1950s that Henry purchased his very first Sperry bombsight computer, in mint condition, from an army surplus warehouse in Shude Hill, Manchester. This purchase was inspired by Henry's lifelong passion for all things mechanical, which had been further fuelled by seven years serving as a technical clerk with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers during World War Two. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Henry so marvelled at the mechanical inner workings of this bombsight computer in motion, that he eventually decided to capture its \\"peerless parabolas\\" (as Henry termed its inner workings), on paper. He then modified the bombsight to create the first drawing machine of 1960. A second was constructed in 1963 and a third in 1967. (O'Hanrahan 2005) These machines created complex, abstract, asymmetrical, curvilinear, repetitive line drawings which were either left untouched as completed drawings or embellished by the artist's hand in response to the suggestive machine-generated effects. None of Henry's machines now remains in operational order. (O'Hanrahan 2005) The drawing machines Henry's first drawing machine Each Henry drawing machine was based around an analogue bombsight computer in combination with other components which Henry happened to have acquired for his home-based workshop in Whalley Range, Manchester. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Each machine took up to six weeks to construct and each drawing from between two hours to two days to complete. The drawing machines relied upon an external electric power source to operate either one or two servo motors which powered the synchronisation of suspended drawing implement(s) acting upon either a stationary or moving drawing table. (O'Hanrahan 2005) With the first drawing machine Henry employed biros as the mark-making implement; however with the machines that followed he preferred to use Indian ink in technical tube pens, since these effects, in contrast to biro ink, do not risk fading upon prolonged exposure to sunlight. (O'Hanrahan 2005) How the drawing machines operated Henry's drawing machines were quite unlike the conventional computers of the 1960s since they could not be pre-programmed nor store information. (O'Hanrahan 2005) His machines relied instead, as did those of artist Jean Tinguely, upon a \\"mechanics of chance\\". (Pontus Hulten in Peiry 1997, p. 237) That is to say, they relied upon the chance relationship in the arrangement of each machine's mechanical components, the slightest alteration to which, (for example, a loosened screw), could dramatically impinge on the final result. In the words of Henry, he let each machine \\"do its own thing\\" in accordance with its sui generis mechanical features, with often surprising and unpredictable results. The imprecise way Henry's machines were both constructed and operated ensured that their effects could not be mass-produced and would be infinitely varied. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Such imprecise tools as Henry's machines, have been judged by some to enhance artistic creativity as opposed to modern computer imaging software which leaves no scope for artistic intuition. (Reffin-Smith 1997) Nor could Henry's machines have been accused of preventing the artist from exercising aesthetic choice. They were truly interactive, like modern computer graphic manipulation software. With a Henry drawing machine, the artist had general overall control and was free to exercise personal and artistic intuition at any given moment of his choosing during the drawing production process. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Both these elements of chance and interaction were in contrast to most other computer artists or graphic designers of the period, for whom the first stage in producing a digital computer graphic was to conceive the end product. The next stage was one where, \\"mathematical formulae or geometric pattern manipulations (were) found to represent the desired lines. These were then programmed into a computer language, punched onto cards, and read into the computer\\". (Sumner 1968 p. 11) Machine-generated effects Picture produced by Drawing Machine 1 In 2001 Henry's machine- generated work was discussed in terms of the use made, since earliest times, of a range of tools for producing similar abstract, visual effects. (O'Hanrahan 2001) Once Henry himself had beheld the visual effects produced by his first machine, he then strove to find possible precursors such as the organic forms described in natural form mathematics. (D'Arcy-Thompson 1917; Cook 1914). Henry also compared his machine-generated effects to those produced using earlier scientific and mathematical instruments such as: Suardi's Geometric Pen of 1750 (Adams 1813), Pendulum Harmonographs (Goold et al., 1909) and the Geometric Lathe as used in ornamental and bank-note engraving. (Holtzapffel 1973 [1894]) His inclusion in 1968 in Cybernetic Serendipity enabled him to further contrast his machine-generated effects with similar though less complex and varied ones produced using a variety of tools. These included effects displayed on a visual display screen using a cathode- ray oscilloscope (Ben F. Laposky in Cybernetic Serendipity 1968) and those produced using a mechanical plotter linked to either a digital (Lloyd Sumner in Cybernetic Serendipity 1968) or analogue computer (Maughan S. Mason in Cybernetic Serendipity 1968). However Henry's drawing machines, in contrast to other precision mark-making instruments like the lathe and mechanical plotter, relied heavily upon the element of chance both in their construction and function. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Fractal mathematics Henry's introduction in 2001 to the aesthetic application of fractal mathematics (Briggs 1994[1992]) provided Henry with the necessary terms of reference for describing the chance-based operational aspects of his machines. Fractal mathematics could also help describe the aesthetic appreciation of his machine-generated effects or \\"mechanical fractals\\" (Henry 2002) as he came to term them. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Fractal systems are produced by a dynamic, non-linear system of interdependent and interacting elements; in Henry's case, this is represented by the mechanisms and motions of the drawing machine itself. (O'Hanrahan 2005) In a fractal system, as in each Henry drawing machine, very small changes or adjustments to initial influences can have far-reaching effects. Fractal images appeal to our intuitive aesthetic appreciation of order and chaos combined. Each Henry machine-produced drawing bears all the hallmarks of a fractal image since they embody regularity and repetition coupled with abrupt changes and discontinuities. (Briggs 1994[1992]) In other words, they exhibit self-similarity (similar details on different scales) and simultaneous order and chaos. These images also resemble fractal \\"strange attractors\\", since groups of curves present in the machine-generated effects tend to form clusters creating suggestive patterns. (Briggs 1994[1992]) Fractal patterns, similar to Henry's machine-generated effects, have been found to exist when plotting volcanic tremors, weather systems, the ECG of heart beats and the electroencephalographic data of brain activity. (Briggs 1994[1992]) Henry found in fractals a means of both classifying his artistic activity and describing the aesthetic appreciation of his visual effects. Among the many artists who have previously employed what are now recognised as fractal images, are: \\"Vincent van Gogh's dense swirls of energy around objects; the recursive geometries of Maritus Escher; the drip-paint, tangled abstractions of Jackson Pollock\\". (Briggs 1994[1992] p. 166) Art and technology Some would argue that scientific and technological advances have always influenced art in terms of its inspiration, tools and visual effects. In the words of Douglas Davis: \\"Art can no more reject either technology or science than it can the world itself\\". (Davis 1973, introduction) In his writings Henry himself often expressed his lifelong enthusiasm for fruitful collaborations between art and technology.(Henry: 1962, 1964, 1969, 1972) During the First Machine Age, prior to World War Two, enthusiasm for technological advances was expressed by the Machine Aesthetic which heralded the Modern Movement. (Banham 1960) Affiliated art movements of this time which shared aspects of the Machine Aesthetic included: Purism in France, Futurism in Italy (both of which celebrated the glories of modern machines and the excitement of speed), Suprematism, Productivism in Russia, Constructivism, Precisionism in North America and kinetic sculpture. (Meecham and Sheldon 2000) By the 1960s, in the Second Machine Age, technology provided not only the inspiration for art production but above all its tools (Popper 1993), as reflected by the Art and Technology movement in the United States. Adherents to this movement employed only the very latest available computer equipment. In this early phase of computer art, programmers became artists and artists became programmers to experiment with the computer's creative possibilities (Darley, 1990). Since Henry worked in comparative artistic and scientific isolation, he did not have access to the latest technological innovations, in contrast to those working, for example, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (O'Hanrahan 2005) By the 1970s, the earlier enthusiasm for technology witnessed in the 60s gave way to the post-modern loss of faith in technology as its destructive effects, both in war and on the environment, became more apparent. (Lucie-Smith 1980) Goodman (1987) suggests that it is since 1978 that a second generation of computer artists may be recognised; a generation which no longer needs to be electronically knowledgeable or adept because the \\"software does it for them\\". (Goodman 1987, p. 47) This is in contrast to Henry who had to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to manipulate and modify the components of the bombsight computers to construct the drawing machines. (O'Hanrahan 2005) During the 1980s, the application in computers of the microchip (developed by 1972) increased the affordability of a home computer and led to the development of interactive computer graphics programmes like Sketchpad and various Paintbox systems. (Darley 1991) During this period, computer art gave way almost completely to computer graphics as the computer's imaging capabilities became exploited both industrially and commercially and moved into entertainment related spheres, e.g.: Pixar, Lucas Films. (Goodman 1987) The computer once again became, for some, an undisputed artistic tool in its own right. (Goodman 1987) This renewed enthusiasm in the computer's artistic possibilities has been further reflected by the emergence towards the end of the twentieth century of various forms of cyber, virtual, or digital art, examples of which include algorithmic art and fractal art. By the twenty-first century, digitally produced and/or manipulated images were exhibited in galleries as veritable works of art in their own right (O'Hanrahan 2005). Legacy Henry's drawing machines of the 1960s represented a remarkable innovation in the field of art and technology for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the bombsight analogue computer provided not only the inspiration but also the main tool for producing highly original visual effects. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Secondly, his machines' reliance on a mechanics of chance, as opposed to pre-determined computer programmes, ensured the unrepeatable and unique quality of his infinitely varied machine-generated effects or \\"mechanical fractals\\". (O'Hanrahan 2005) Thirdly, the spontaneous, interactive potential of his drawing machines' modus operandi pre-empted by some twenty years this particular aspect of later computer graphic manipulation software. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Finally, Henry was never artistically inspired by the graphic potential of the modern digital computer. (O'Hanrahan 2005) He much preferred the direct interaction afforded by the clearly visible interconnecting mechanical components of the earlier analogue computer and as a consequence of his drawing machines also. This was in stark contrast to the invisible and indirect workings of the later digital computer: \\"the mechanical analogue computer, was a work of art in itself, involving a most beautiful arrangement of gears, belts, cams differentials and so on- it still retained in its working a visual attractiveness which has now vanished in the modern electronic counterpart; ‚Ä¶ I enjoyed seeing the machine work‚Ä¶\\". (Henry, 1972) In view of these considerations, Henry's drawing machines may be said to not only reflect the early experimental phase of Computer Art and computer graphics but to also provide an important artistic and technological link between two distinct ages of the twentieth century: the earlier Mechanical/Industrial Age and the later Electronic/Digital Age.

As goal difference was not used to determine position until 1979, all four teams shared the trophy, holding it for three months each. Had goal difference been used to determine the winner, then England would have won with Scotland second. The competition began unusually with victories by underdogs Wales and Ireland over England and Scotland in their opening matches.

This particular story arc lasts 34 strips long. In 1994, the story arc was reprinted in PB5, the fifth book compilation of the comic strip series. Synopsis The Pugad Baboy ladies and gentlemen engage in a battle of the sexes precipitated by conversations Debbie has with Tomas' ultra- feminist wife, Barbie. The argument centers on the question of which is the weaker sex and on Filipino sexual stereotypes and gender roles. Things come to a head when Dagul and Tomas notice that their wives had been absent from home every night. They track the two women to a Muay Thai dojo, much to their surprise and dismay. The women also receive instruction on Tae Kwon Dog (a play on Tae Kwon Do) from Shin Dong Pol. In retaliation, the men quit their jobs and devote their time to Pao's beauty parlor and playing Mahjong. Dagul soon hits a winning streak in the game. He was on his way home one night, accompanied by Debbie, when the pair were mugged by two goons intent upon divesting the mahjongero of his winnings. Dagul eggs his wife on, telling her to show the bad guys what she had learned in the martial arts. Debbie, however, reverts to the typical female fighting stereotype of hair-pulling. Dagul has no choice but to hand over his winnings to the goons, in keeping with his now-demure gender role. He blows up, however, when one of the muggers slaps Debbie. He beats up both bad guys and ended up with a serious stab wound to the abdomen. All three were rushed to the hospital where Dagul underwent surgery. Policemen placed the goons under arrest. Upon his release from the hospital, Dagul begins to notice that Debbie had reverted to her former sweet, loving self - intent upon serving her recuperating husband.

His parents were Christopher and Mary Ann Wheeler. He was articled to Charles Henry Driver (1832‚Äì1900), whose offices were at 7 Parliament Street, London SW1, and who is best known as the architect for the Victoria Embankment and Abbey Mills. Wheeler began his career as an architect working on a number of commissions in south London. In 1880 Sussex House, on the corner of Tooting Bec Gardens and Ambleside Avenue, was constructed as the Sussex House School (now residential). He designed a number of terraces around Mitcham Lane and Streatham station in what Pevsner calls a 'competent Queen Anne style'. At that time he favoured the use of dark red brick often carved into swags and floral designs. He was the architect for the 1880 Sussex House, on Garrads Rd, WandsworthWandsworth Borough Council Conservation Area Statement. \\"43. Garrads Road\\" accessed 7 July 2013 In 1891 Wheeler lived with his wife Elizabeth (born in Dublin) at 21 Carfax, Horsham, and in 1897 he designed the Westminster bank in the town's main square ‚Äì one of his many commissions for this bank. Major works Wheeler's best known work is St Paul's Studios on Talgarth Road, London, W14 in 1890 which have much in common with the hundreds of other domestic studios constructed towards the end of the 19th century. St Paul's studios were built by Wheeler for James Fairless, a fineart publisher, to house bachelor artists. Wheeler had previously built a similar house on the same street, at number 151, for Sir Coutts Lindsay, founder of the Grosvenor Gallery, which was the main showroom for artists of the aesthetic movement such as Whistler. Sir Edward Burne-Jones painted his last canvas there, and his son, also a painter, lived there for many years. The spaces for art and life at St Paul's Studios comprised three rooms on the ground floor, a studio 30 feet long and 22 ft wide () with a ceiling on the top floor, and a basement flat (which was originally for the housekeeper). In 2003, one of these studios was on the market at ¬£1,100,000 ‚Äì one thousand times the cost of its original construction.

Most of his work is in London, although he also designed banks, a community centre and library at Cowfold in Sussex and St James's church at Littlehampton. In 1899 (KD) his partner was Percy Dean Lodge (who may have worked at Horsham only). From 1903, when this partnership was dissolved, until 1907 he was alone and then from 1907 to 1921 C R B Godman joined him and also his son, C W F Wheeler. Father and son remained partners after 1921 in London only. Lit: BAL Biog file In 1896 he designed an electricity transformer sub-station adjacent to the Roman Catholic church at the junction of Tooting Bec Gardens and Streatham High Road in Lambeth. It was built in coarse rubble with ashlar dressings in what is called a '15th century Gothic style' with large traceried windows.

One tall storey, three bays. Tall hipped slate roof and parapet.

In 1897 Wheeler was commissioned by Sir Henry Harben, President of the Prudential Assurance Co., to design a convalescence home on the sea front at Rustington, Sussex. Pevsner describes this as '...dashing free-Wren design done with enough panache to give it a life of its own ‚Äì a very good seaside building'. This is listed grade II. As well as St Paul's Studios, one of Wheeler's finest buildings is the Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex (still intact) (1902‚Äì04) and an associated chapel which incorporates Art Nouveau designs and motifs. This was commissioned by the London County Council as a replacement for the London Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest formerly at 7 Fitzroy Square, London W1. The chapel is listed grade II*. Later works Whilst living for many years in Horsham, Wheeler also lived in Sutton at least from 1911 in Cambourne Road and in 1922 designed a new house for his family at Cotlands, 86 Mulgrave Road, Sutton, in a style which for the first time included influences of the Modern Movement. He died here in 1931. He clearly knew Sutton well because he also designed Russettings, a house for George Smith, in 1899, at 25 Worcester Road, Sutton, which is now the London Borough of Sutton's Register Office. He was also responsible for a Westminster Bank in Sutton Court Road in 1902 and the Sutton Adult School, Benhill Avenue, Sutton, commissioned in 1909 by Thomas Wall, a local benefactor and CEO of the family's company: ice cream and sausage manufacturer.

It is important to take note of the fact that T2S is not a central securities depository (CSD), but a platform which will enable CSDs to increase their competitiveness. After market consultations and a decision by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB), the project was launched in 2008 and the platform is scheduled to start operations in 2015. The T2S Framework Agreement, negotiated between CSDs and the Eurosystem, has been signed by 24 CSDs,\\"Central securities depositories (CSDs)\\", European Central Bank. Retrieved 2 June 2014. which will migrate to the T2S platform in four waves between June 2015 and February 2017.\\"History\\", European Central Bank. Retrieved 2 June 2014. The fundamental objective of the T2S project is to integrate and harmonise the highly fragmented securities settlement infrastructure in Europe. It aims to reduce the costs of cross-border securities settlement and to increase competition and choice amongst providers of post-trading services in Europe. It will therefore be a critical step forward in the creation of the single market for financial services in the European Union. The development and operation of T2S was assigned to four central banks of the Eurosystem‚Äîthose of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The project is being coordinated by the ECB. The IT platform will be owned and operated by the Eurosystem. Technical details of the project are available at the ECB T2S project website. Objective and benefits One of the objectives of T2S is to reduce the cost of securities settlement in Europe, in particular for transactions across EU countries, which can be ten times more expensive than domestic transactions. In addition, banks will be able to optimise their collateral (finance) and liquidity management.\\"Survey on the Benefits of TARGET2-Securities\\", Clearstream. The T2S settlement platform is also a step towards a single market for financial services. The T2S project will be a catalyst for further harmonisation of post-trade practices and regulations across Europe. Significant progress has already been made by the T2S governance bodies, composed of industry experts, on harmonisation of instructions management and settlement processes, as well as on the processing of corporate actions on unsettled transactions.\\"Fourth T2S Harmonisation Progress Report\\", European Central Bank, 19 March 2014. As a result of reduced settlement costs, increased competition, and greater harmonisation, T2S is expected to have a positive impact on European economic growth. The lower costs of settlement, and potentially the costs for other post-trade services, are expected to be passed on to investors. Furthermore, by making it easier and less costly to access securities in other EU countries, investors could benefit from more diversified bond and equity portfolios. In addition, issuers will gain access to a more diversified investor base. The T2S platform may also have a positive impact on financial stability. In particular, it will reduce the risks that still affect the settlement of cross-border transactions. With its robust business continuity solution, it will also decrease counterparty and settlement agent risk. Additionally, by fostering greater efficiency and integration of European financial markets, T2S may lead to greater diversification and sharing of risks, adding to the stability of the whole system.\\"Financial Integration in Europe\\", European Central Bank, April 2014. Due to the lean T2S concept and the resulting facilitation of post-trade activities, banks will be able to streamline their back offices and thus produce cost savings. As T2S will separate the settlement infrastructure from the services offered by CSDs, competition in the provision of these services will increase and benefit the customers Europe-wide.\\"T2S Benefits: Much More Than Fee Reductions\\", European Central Bank, T2S Special Series, June 2012. Origin Historically, financial market infrastructures in Europe were created to meet the requirements of national financial markets. In most cases, there were one or two dominant players at each stage of the value chain: typically one stock exchange for trading, one central counterparty (CCP) for clearing and at least one CSD for settlement. Furthermore, these national infrastructures were primarily designed to manage securities denominated in the national currency. Securities settlement across Europe thus remained costly and cumbersome. Despite the introduction of the euro more than ten years ago, the provision of post-trading services (i.e., clearing and settlement) remained heavily fragmented along national lines. For example, there were still 19 CSDs operating in the euro area in 2009 and almost 40 in the 27 countries of the EU. This situation is clearly not optimal for a single currency area or for the EU, as it encourages each country's financial market to remain domestically oriented. Investors continue to invest mostly in domestic securities, and as a result, the euro-area financial market cannot fully benefit from the risk diversification and competition benefits that arise from having a single currency. These barriers which provoke a considerable competitive disadvantage for European capital markets were identified in a report by the Giovannini Group.\\"Second Report on EU Clearing and Settlement Arrangements\\", The Giovannini Group, June 2003.\\"Payments, Securities and Derivatives, and the Role of the Eurosystem\\", European Central Bank, 2010. EU authorities have taken up initiatives to remove impediments to competition between national markets. The most important initiatives from the European Commission are the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR). T2S as a pan-European platform is intended to complement these existing initiatives by boosting competition, increasing price transparency, and harmonising practices across Europe.

Various generalizations to this distribution exist for cases where the picking of colored balls is biased so that balls of one color are more likely to be picked than balls of another color. This can be illustrated by the following example. Assume that an opinion poll is conducted by calling random telephone numbers. Unemployed people are more likely to be home and answer the phone than employed people are. Therefore, unemployed respondents are likely to be over-represented in the sample. The probability distribution of employed versus unemployed respondents in a sample of n respondents can be described as a noncentral hypergeometric distribution. The description of biased urn models is complicated by the fact that there is more than one noncentral hypergeometric distribution. Which distribution you get depends on whether items (e.g. colored balls) are sampled one by one in a manner where there is competition between the items, or they are sampled independently of each other. There is widespread confusion about this fact. The name noncentral hypergeometric distribution has been used for two different distributions, and several scientists have used the wrong distribution or erroneously believed that the two distributions were identical. The use of the same name for two different distributions has been possible because these two distributions were studied by two different groups of scientists with hardly any contact with each other. Agner Fog (2007, 2008) has suggested that the best way to avoid confusion is to use the name Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution for the distribution of a biased urn model where a predetermined number of items are drawn one by one in a competitive manner, while the name Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution is used where items are drawn independently of each other, so that the total number of items drawn is known only after the experiment. The names refer to Kenneth Ted Wallenius and R. A. Fisher who were the first to describe the respective distributions. Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution has previously been given the name extended hypergeometric distribution, but this name is rarely used in the scientific literature, except in handbooks that need to distinguish between the two distributions. Some scientists are strongly opposed to using this name. A thorough explanation of the difference between the two noncentral hypergeometric distributions is obviously needed here. Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution Wallenius' distribution can be explained as follows. Assume that an urn contains m_1 red balls and m_2 white balls, totalling N = m_1 + m_2 balls. n balls are drawn at random from the urn one by one without replacement. Each red ball has the weight \\\\omega_1, and each white ball has the weight \\\\omega_2. We assume that the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight. The physical property that determines the odds may be something else than weight, such as size or slipperiness or some other factor, but it is convenient to use the word weight for the odds parameter. The probability that the first ball picked is red is equal to the weight fraction of red balls: : p_1 = \\\\frac{m_1 \\\\omega_1}{m_1 \\\\omega_1 + m_2 \\\\omega_2}. The probability that the second ball picked is red depends on whether the first ball was red or white. If the first ball was red then the above formula is used with m_1 reduced by one. If the first ball was white then the above formula is used with m_2 reduced by one. The important fact that distinguishes Wallenius' distribution is that there is competition between the balls. The probability that a particular ball is taken in a particular draw depends not only on its own weight, but also on the total weight of the competing balls that remain in the urn at that moment. And the weight of the competing balls depends on the outcomes of all preceding draws. A multivariate version of Wallenius' distribution is used if there are more than two different colors. The distribution of the balls that are not drawn is a complementary Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution. Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution In the Fisher model, the fates of the balls are independent and there is no dependence between draws. We may as well take all n balls at the same time. Each ball has no \\"knowledge\\" of what happens to the other balls. For the same reason, it is impossible to know the value of n before the experiment. If we tried to fix the value of n then we would have no way of preventing ball number n+1 from being taken without violating the principle of independence between balls. n is therefore a random variable, and the Fisher distribution is a conditional distribution which can only be determined after the experiment when n is observed. The unconditional distribution is two independent binomials, one for each color. Fisher's distribution can simply be defined as the conditional distribution of two or more independent binomial variates dependent upon their sum. A multivariate version of the Fisher's distribution is used if there are more than two colors of balls.  The difference between the two noncentral hypergeometric distributions  leftthumb300px Comparison of distributions with same odds: Blue: Wallenius œâ=0.5 Red: Fisher œâ=0.5 Green: Central hypergeometric œâ=1. m1=80, m2=60, n=100 nonethumb300px Comparison of distributions with same mean: Blue: Wallenius œâ=0.5 Red: Fisher œâ=0.28 Green: Central hypergeometric œâ=1. m1=80, m2=60, n=100 Wallenius‚Äô and Fisher's distributions are approximately equal when the odds ratio \\\\omega = \\\\omega_1/\\\\omega_2 is near 1, and n is low compared to the total number of balls, N. The difference between the two distributions becomes higher when the odds ratio is far from one and n is near N. The two distributions approximate each other better when they have the same mean than when they have the same odds (w = 1) (see figures above). Both distributions degenerate into the hypergeometric distribution when the odds ratio is 1, or to the binomial distribution when n = 1. To understand why the two distributions are different, we may consider the following extreme example: An urn contains one red ball with the weight 1000, and a thousand white balls each with the weight 1. We want to calculate the probability that the red ball is not taken. First we consider the Wallenius model. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the first draw is 1000/2000 = ¬Ω. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the second draw, under the condition that it was not taken in the first draw, is 999/1999 ‚âà ¬Ω. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the third draw, under the condition that it was not taken in the first two draws, is 998/1998 ‚âà ¬Ω. Continuing in this way, we can calculate that the probability of not taking the red ball in n draws is approximately 2‚àín as long as n is small compared to N. In other words, the probability of not taking a very heavy ball in n draws falls almost exponentially with n in Wallenius‚Äô model. The exponential function arises because the probabilities for each draw are all multiplied together. This is not the case in Fisher's model where balls are taken independently, and possibly simultaneously. Here the draws are independent and the probabilities are therefore not multiplied together. The probability of not taking the heavy red ball in Fisher's model is approximately 1/(n+1). The two distributions are therefore very different in this extreme case, even though they are quite similar in less extreme cases. The following conditions must be fulfilled for Wallenius‚Äô distribution to be applicable: * Items are taken randomly from a finite source containing different kinds of items without replacement. * Items are drawn one by one. * The probability of taking a particular item at a particular draw is equal to its fraction of the total \\"weight\\" of all items that have not yet been taken at that moment. The weight of an item depends only on its kind (color). * The total number n of items to take is fixed and independent of which items happen to be taken first. The following conditions must be fulfilled for Fisher's distribution to be applicable: * Items are taken randomly from a finite source containing different kinds of items without replacement. * Items are taken independently of each other. Whether one item is taken is independent of whether another item is taken. Whether one item is taken before, after, or simultaneously with another item is irrelevant. * The probability of taking a particular item is proportional to its \\"weight\\". The weight of an item depends only on its kind (color). * The total number n of items that will be taken is not known before the experiment. * n is determined after the experiment and the conditional distribution for n known is desired. Examples The following examples will further clarify which distribution to use in different situations. =Example 1= You are catching fish in a small lake that contains a limited number of fish. There are different kinds of fish with different weights. The probability of catching a particular fish at a particular moment is proportional to its weight. You are catching the fish one by one with a fishing rod. You have decided to catch n fish. You are determined to catch exactly n fish regardless of how long it may take. You are stopping after you have caught n fish even if you can see more fish that are tempting you. This scenario will give a distribution of the types of fish caught that is equal to Wallenius‚Äô noncentral hypergeometric distribution. =Example 2= You are catching fish as in example 1, but you are using a big net. You are setting up the net one day and coming back the next day to remove the net. You count how many fish you have caught and then you go home regardless of how many fish you have caught. Each fish has a probability of getting into the net that is proportional to its weight but independent of what happens to the other fish. The total number of fish that will be caught in this scenario is not known in advance. The expected number of fish caught is therefore described by multiple binomial distributions, one for each kind of fish. After the fish have been counted, the total number n of fish is known. The probability distribution when n is known (but the number of each type is not known yet) is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. =Example 3= You are catching fish with a small net. It is possible that more than one fish can go into the net at the same time. You are using the net multiple times until you have got at least n fish. This scenario gives a distribution that lies between Wallenius‚Äô and Fisher's distributions. The total number of fish caught can vary if you are getting too many fish in the last catch. You may put the excess fish back into the lake, but this still doesn't give Wallenius‚Äô distribution. This is because you are catching multiple fish at the same time. The condition that each catch depends on all previous catches does not hold for fish that are caught simultaneously or in the same operation. The resulting distribution will be close to Wallenius‚Äô distribution if there are only few fish in the net in each catch and you are catching many times. The resulting distribution will be close to Fisher's distribution if there are many fish in the net in each catch and you are catching few times. =Example 4= You are catching fish with a big net. Fish are swimming into the net randomly in a situation that resembles a Poisson process. You are watching the net all the time and take up the net as soon as you have caught exactly n fish. The resulting distribution will be close to Fisher's distribution because the fish swim into the net independently of each other. But the fates of the fish are not totally independent because a particular fish can be saved from getting caught if n other fish happen to get into the net before the time that this particular fish would have been caught. This is more likely to happen if the other fish are heavy than if they are light. =Example 5= You are catching fish one by one with a fishing rod as in example 1. You need a particular amount of fish in order to feed your family. You are stopping when the total weight of the fish you have caught exceeds a predetermined limit. The resulting distribution will be close to Wallenius‚Äô distribution, but not exactly because the decision to stop depends on the weight of the fish you have caught so far. n is therefore not known exactly before the fishing trip. =Conclusion to the examples= These examples show that the distribution of the types of fish you catch depends on the way they are caught. Many situations will give a distribution that lies somewhere between Wallenius‚Äô and Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distributions. An interesting consequence of the difference between these two distributions is that you will get more of the heavy fish, on average, if you catch n fish one by one than if you catch all n at the same time. These conclusions can of course be applied to biased sampling of other items than fish. In general, we can say that the odds parameter has a stronger effect in Wallenius' distribution than in Fisher's distribution, especially when n/N is high. leftthumb300px Probability mass function for Wallenius' Noncentral Hypergeometric Distribution for different values of the odds ratio œâ. m1 = 80, m2 = 60, n = 100, œâ = 0.1 ... 20 nonethumb300px Probability mass function for Fisher's Noncentral Hypergeometric Distribution for different values of the odds ratio œâ. m1 = 80, m2 = 60, n = 100, œâ = 0.01 ... 1000 See also * Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution * Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution * hypergeometric distribution * urn problem * Bias * Biased sample References . . . .

The station's broadcast license was held by James L. Primm. This was the third station in Honolulu to carry the KORL calls, whose previous homes were at 650 and 690 AM respectively. History This frequency was once home to Japanese- language broadcaster KOHO, which was at 1170 kHz, up until its sign-off in 2002, when its changed calls to KENT. In 2005, Salem bought the signal back on the air as KHCM and adopted a country music format. In 2006, it moved to the 1180 frequency, followed by a swap with KORL's owners for the 690 signal. Construction permit On August 18, 2008, this station was granted a construction permit to relocate to 1170 kHz, downgrade to a class D station with 330 watts of daytime power and 140 watts at night, plus relocate the broadcast transmitter southeast to 21¬∞20'10\\"N, 157¬∞53'33\\"W, the former KRUD (now KPHI) tower site. The new facilities were not built and the construction permit expired. Silent On September 23, 2008, KORL signed off the air to make way for the sign-on of sister station KPHI, whose 1130 frequency offers a better signal coverage on the island and whose construction permit was about to expire. On October 14, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accepted for filing a request by KORL for special temporary authority to remain silent for technical reasons until the new transmitter site authorized by the August 2008 construction permit can be completed. The station's application states that ownership expects KORL, to be silent for only a short period of time. On September 17, 2009, Hochman-McCain announced that it had sold KORL to Centro Cristiano Vida Abundante, a religious broadcaster whose programming targets a Hispanic audience. When the station returned to the air in 2010, it broadcast a Spanish Religious format, Hawaii's first Spanish- language radio station. In June 2011, Centro Cristiano Vida Abundante, Inc., reached an agreement to sell KORL to James L. Primm for $37,000. The FCC approved the license transfer on July 6, 2011, and the transaction was consummated on August 8, 2011. The FCC cancelled KORL's license on May 5, 2015, due to the station having been silent for more than twelve months (since October 7, 2013).

The minster church of Saints Peter and Paul, the former abbey church, located on a prominent elevation, still dominates the landscape for miles around. History =First foundation= In 776 the noble clan of the Ahalolfinger made a gift of the monastery founded by their ancestor Halaholf and his wife to St Gall's Abbey. By 993 the monastery had become a collegiate foundation of canons dedicated by Herman II, Duke of Swabia, and his wife Gerberga to the apostles Peter and Paul. During the 12th century the monastery passed through the possession of a series of Swabian nobles, including the Staufen and particularly Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. These constant changes of proprietor caused a severe decline in the monastery. =Second foundation= In 1171 the monastery was refounded by Pfalzgraf Hugo II of T√ºbingen as a Premonstratensian double abbey for men and women and given an adequate endowment. The canons were brought from M√∂nchsrot Abbey in Rot an der Rot. The existing premises were extensive and large-scale construction was not immediately necessary. The first prior of the new foundation was Eberhard von Wolfegg from M√∂nchsrot Abbey. Between 1204-1208 Prior Meinhardt had the walls rebuilt. Prior Walther II had the old church extended to a three-aisled basilica, which was dedicated on 2 May 1239 by Henry I, Bishop of Constance. In 1273 Prior Konrad (1226‚Äì75) forbade any more admissions to women, and the double monastery soon became one for men only. Under Prior Heinrich M√∂rstetter (1436‚Äì61) Marchtal was raised to the status of an abbey, in 1440. In 1500 it was made an Imperial abbey, with a place and vote in the Reichstag. In 1609 the abbot received the right to bear the pontificalia (mitre, ring and pectoral cross). At this period more than 20 places and estates belonged to the territory of the abbey, besides houses in the towns of Reutlingen, Ehingen, Munderkingen and Riedlingen. The Thirty Years' War caused much distress in the southwest of Germany. In 1632 the canons had to flee from the Swedes. The buildings survived the war, but in a very dilapidated state. It was left to the 15th abbot, the young Nikolaus Magnus Wierith, to undertake the restorations. Planning for the construction of the new church began in 1674; the first stone was laid in 1686, and the dedication took place in 1701. During this period the monk Isfrid Kayser (1712-1771) became known for his compositions. The abbey was dissolved in 1803 during the secularisation following upon the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, and with its territories became the possession of the Princes of Thurn und Taxis, who administered it as part of the Principality of Buchau. In 1806 the former abbey was mediatised by the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. The abbey church became the parish church and the monastery became a \\"castle\\" (Schloss) or country house. =Salesian Sisters= In 1919 a group of sisters of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, also sometimes known as \\"Salesian sisters\\", from Chotieschau Abbey in Bohemia (now Chotƒõ≈°ov Abbey, Czech Republic) were given accommodation in the north wing. The sisters ran a secondary school for girls here until 1992, when it was taken over by the \\"Stiftung Katholische Schule der Di√∂zese Rottenburg- Stuttgart\\". The convent moved in 1997 to Untermarchtal. In 1973 the diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart bought the entire monastic complex from the Princes Thurn und Taxis, and converted it into a teacher training academy, opened on 8 September 1978. On 16 September 2001, to mark the 300th anniversary of the dedication of the church, Bishop Gebhard F√ºrst raised the abbey church to the rank of a minster church.

A log-normal distribution of coal-fired fly ash. Significance The PSD of a material can be important in understanding its physical and chemical properties. It affects the strength and load-bearing properties of rocks and soils. It affects the reactivity of solids participating in chemical reactions, and needs to be tightly controlled in many industrial products such as the manufacture of printer toner, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. Significance in the collection of particulate matter Particle size distribution can greatly affect the efficiency of any collection device. Settling chambers will normally only collect very large particles, those that can be separated using sieve trays. Centrifugal collectors will normally collect particles down to about 20 Œºm. Higher efficiency models can collect particles down to 10 Œºm. Fabric filters are one of the most efficient and cost effective types of dust collectors available and can achieve a collection efficiency of more than 99% for very fine particles. Wet scrubbers that use liquid are commonly known as wet scrubbers. In these systems, the scrubbing liquid (usually water) comes into contact with a gas stream containing dust particles. The greater the contact of the gas and liquid streams, the higher the dust removal efficiency. Electrostatic precipitators use electrostatic forces to separate dust particles from exhaust gases. They can be very efficient at the collection of very fine particles. Filter Press used for filtering liquids by cake filtration mechanism. The PSD plays an important part in the cake formation, cake resistance, and cake characteristics. The filterability of the liquid is determined largely by the size of the particles. Nomenclature œÅp: Actual particle density (g/cm3) œÅg: Gas or sample matrix density (g/cm3) r2: Least- squares coefficient of determination. The closer this value is to 1.0, the better the data fit to a hyperplane representing the relationship between the response variable and a set of covariate variables. A value equal to 1.0 indicates all data fit perfectly within the hyperplane. Œª: Gas mean free path (cm) D50: Mass-median-diameter (MMD). The log-normal distribution mass median diameter. The MMD is considered to be the average particle diameter by mass. œÉg: Geometric standard deviation. This value is determined mathematically by the equation: :œÉg = D84.13/D50 = D50/D15.87 The value of œÉg determines the slope of the least-squares regression curve. Œ±: Relative standard deviation or degree of polydispersity. This value is also determined mathematically. For values less than 0.1, the particulate sample can be considered to be monodisperse. :Œ± = œÉg/D50 Re(P) : Particle Reynolds Number. In contrast to the large numerical values noted for flow Reynolds number, particle Reynolds number for fine particles in gaseous mediums is typically less than 0.1. Ref : Flow Reynolds number. Kn: Particle Knudsen number. Types PSD is usually defined by the method by which it is determined. The most easily understood method of determination is sieve analysis, where powder is separated on sieves of different sizes. Thus, the PSD is defined in terms of discrete size ranges: e.g. \\"% of sample between 45 Œºm and 53 Œºm\\", when sieves of these sizes are used. The PSD is usually determined over a list of size ranges that covers nearly all the sizes present in the sample. Some methods of determination allow much narrower size ranges to be defined than can be obtained by use of sieves, and are applicable to particle sizes outside the range available in sieves. However, the idea of the notional \\"sieve\\", that \\"retains\\" particles above a certain size, and \\"passes\\" particles below that size, is universally used in presenting PSD data of all kinds. The PSD may be expressed as a \\"range\\" analysis, in which the amount in each size range is listed in order. It may also be presented in \\"cumulative\\" form, in which the total of all sizes \\"retained\\" or \\"passed\\" by a single notional \\"sieve\\" is given for a range of sizes. Range analysis is suitable when a particular ideal mid-range particle size is being sought, while cumulative analysis is used where the amount of \\"under-size\\" or \\"over-size\\" must be controlled. The way in which \\"size\\" is expressed is open to a wide range of interpretations. A simple treatment assumes the particles are spheres that will just pass through a square hole in a \\"sieve\\". In practice, particles are irregular ‚Äì often extremely so, for example in the case of fibrous materials ‚Äì and the way in which such particles are characterized during analysis is very dependent on the method of measurement used. Sampling Before a PSD can be determined, it is vital that a representative sample is obtained. In the case where the material to be analysed is flowing, the sample must be withdrawn from the stream in such a way that the sample has the same proportions of particle sizes as the stream. The best way to do this is to take many samples of the whole stream over a period, instead of taking a portion of the stream for the whole time.p. 6 In the case where the material is in a heap, scoop or thief sampling needs to be done, which is inaccurate: the sample should ideally have been taken while the powder was flowing towards the heap.p. 10 After sampling, the sample volume typically needs to be reduced. The material to be analysed must be carefully blended, and the sample withdrawn using techniques that avoid size segregation, for example using a rotary dividerp. 5. Particular attention must be paid to avoidance of loss of fines during manipulation of the sample. Measurement techniques =Sieve analysis= Sieve analysis is often used because of its simplicity, cheapness, and ease of interpretation. Methods may be simple shaking of the sample in sieves until the amount retained becomes more or less constant. Alternatively, the sample may be washed through with a non-reacting liquid (usually water) or blown through with an air current. Advantages: this technique is well-adapted for bulk materials. A large amount of materials can be readily loaded into sieve trays. Two common uses in the powder industry are wet-sieving of milled limestone and dry-sieving of milled coal. Disadvantages: many PSDs are concerned with particles too small for separation by sieving to be practical. A very fine sieve, such as 37 Œºm sieve, is exceedingly fragile, and it is very difficult to get material to pass through it. Another disadvantage is that the amount of energy used to sieve the sample is arbitrarily determined. Over-energetic sieving causes attrition of the particles and thus changes the PSD, while insufficient energy fails to break down loose agglomerates. Although manual sieving procedures can be ineffective, automated sieving technologies using image fragmentation analysis software are available. These technologies can sieve material by capturing and analyzing a photo of material. =Air elutriation analysis= Material may be separated by means of air elutriation, which employs an apparatus with a vertical tube through which fluid is passed at a controlled velocity. When the particles are introduced, often through a side tube, the smaller particles are carried over in the fluid stream while the large particles settle against the upward current. If we start with low flow rates small less dense particle attain terminal velocities, and flow with the stream, the particle from the stream is collected in overflow and hence will be separated from the feed. Flow rates can be increased to separate higher size ranges. Further size fractions may be collected if the overflow from the first tube is passed vertically upwards through a second tube of greater cross-section, and any number of such tubes can be arranged in series. Advantages: a bulk sample is analyzed using centrifugal classification and the technique is non- destructive. Each cut-point can be recovered for future size-respective chemical analyses. This technique has been used for decades in the air pollution control industry (data used for design of control devices). This technique determines particle size as a function of settling velocity in an air stream (as opposed to water, or some other liquid). Disadvantages: a bulk sample (about ten grams) must be obtained. It is a fairly time-consuming analytical technique. The actual test methodASME Shop ‚Äì Standards, Courses, Journals, Books and Proceedings ‚Äì ASME. Catalog.asme.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-18. has been withdrawn by ASME due to obsolescence. Instrument calibration materials are therefore no longer available. =Photoanalysis= Materials can now be analysed through photoanalysis procedures. Unlike sieve analyses which can be time-consuming and inaccurate, taking a photo of a sample of the materials to be measured and using software to analyze the photo can result in rapid, accurate measurements. Another advantage is that the material can be analyzed without being handled. This is beneficial in the agricultural industry, as handling of food products can lead to contamination. Photoanalysis equipment and software is currently being used in mining, forestry and agricultural industries worldwide. =Optical counting methods= PSDs can be measured microscopically by sizing against a graticule and counting, but for a statistically valid analysis, millions of particles must be measured. This is impossibly arduous when done manually, but automated analysis of electron micrographs is now commercially available. It is used to determine the particle size within the range of 0.2 to 100 micrometers. =Electroresistance counting methods= An example of this is the Coulter counter, which measures the momentary changes in the conductivity of a liquid passing through an orifice that take place when individual non-conducting particles pass through. The particle count is obtained by counting pulses. This pulse is proportional to the volume of the sensed particle. Advantages: very small sample aliquots can be examined. Disadvantages: sample must be dispersed in a liquid medium... some particles may (partially or fully) dissolve in the medium altering the size distribution. The results are only related to the projected cross-sectional area that a particle displaces as it passes through an orifice. This is a physical diameter, not really related to mathematical descriptions of particles (e.g. terminal settling velocity). =Sedimentation techniques= These are based upon study of the terminal velocity acquired by particles suspended in a viscous liquid. Sedimentation time is longest for the finest particles, so this technique is useful for sizes below 10 Œºm, but sub-micrometer particles cannot be reliably measured due to the effects of Brownian motion. Typical apparatus disperses the sample in liquid, then measures the density of the column at timed intervals. Other techniques determine the optical density of successive layers using visible light or x-rays. Advantages: this technique determines particle size as a function of settling velocity. Disadvantages: Sample must be dispersed in a liquid medium... some particles may (partially or fully) dissolve in the medium altering the size distribution, requiring careful selection of the dispersion media. Density is highly dependent upon fluid temperature remaining constant. X-Rays will not count carbon (organic) particles. Many of these instruments can require a bulk sample (e.g. two to five grams). =Laser diffraction methods= These depend upon analysis of the \\"halo\\" of diffracted light produced when a laser beam passes through a dispersion of particles in air or in a liquid. The angle of diffraction increases as particle size decreases, so that this method is particularly good for measuring sizes between 0.1 and 3,000 Œºm. Advances in sophisticated data processing and automation have allowed this to become the dominant method used in industrial PSD determination. This technique is relatively fast and can be performed on very small samples. A particular advantage is that the technique can generate a continuous measurement for analyzing process streams. Laser diffraction measures particle size distributions by measuring the angular variation in intensity of light scattered as a laser beam passes through a dispersed particulate sample. Large particles scatter light at small angles relative to the laser beam and small particles scatter light at large angles, as illustrated below. The angular scattering intensity data is then analyzed to calculate the size of the particles responsible for creating the scattering pattern, using the Mie theory or Fraunhofer approximation of light scattering. The particle size is reported as a volume equivalent sphere diameter. =Laser Obscuration Time\\" (LOT) or \\"Time Of Transition\\" (TOT)= A focused laser beam rotates in a constant frequency and interacts with particles within the sample medium. Each randomly scanned particle obscures the laser beam to its dedicated photo diode, which measures the time of obscuration. The time of obscuration directly relates to the particle's Diameter, by a simple calculation principle of multiplying the known beam rotation Velocity in the directly measured Time of obscuration, (D=V*t). =Acoustic spectroscopy or ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy= Instead of light, this method employs ultrasound for collecting information on the particles that are dispersed in fluid. Dispersed particles absorb and scatter ultrasound similarly to light. This has been known since Lord Rayleigh developed the first theory of ultrasound scattering and published a book \\"The Theory of Sound\\" in 1878.Lord Rayleigh, \\"The Theory of Sound\\", vol.2, Macmillan and Co, NY, second edition, 1896, first edition, 1878. There have been hundreds of papers studying ultrasound propagation through fluid particulates in the 20th century.Dukhin, A. S. and Goetz, P. J. Characterization of liquids, nano- and micro- particulates and porous bodies using Ultrasound, Elsevier, 2017 It turns out that instead of measuring scattered energy versus angle, as with light, in the case of ultrasound, measuring the transmitted energy versus frequency is a better choice. The resulting ultrasound attenuation frequency spectra are the raw data for calculating particle size distribution. It can be measured for any fluid system with no dilution or other sample preparation. This is a big advantage of this method. Calculation of particle size distribution is based on theoretical models that are well verified for up to 50% by volume of dispersed particles on micron and nanometer scales. However, as concentration increases and the particle sizes approach the nanoscale, conventional modelling gives way to the necessity to include shear-wave re-conversion effects in order for the models to accurately reflect the real attenuation spectra. =Air pollution emissions measurements= Cascade impactors ‚Äì particulate matter is withdrawn isokinetically from a source and segregated by size in a cascade impactor at the sampling point exhaust conditions of temperature, pressure, etc. Cascade impactors use the principle of inertial separation to size segregate particle samples from a particle laden gas stream. The mass of each size fraction is determined gravimetrically. The California Air Resources Board Method 501State of California Air Resources Board: Method 501 ‚Äì Determination of Size Distribution of Particulate Matter from Stationary Sources. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-11-18. is currently the most widely accepted test method for particle size distribution emissions measurements. Mathematical models =Probability distributions= * The log-normal distribution is often used to approximate the particle size distribution of aerosols, aquatic particles and pulverized material. * The Weibull distribution or Rosin‚ÄìRammler distribution is a useful distribution for representing particle size distributions generated by grinding, milling and crushing operations. * The log-hyperbolic distribution was proposed by Bagnold and Barndorff-Nielsen to model the particle-size distribution of naturally occurring sediments. This model suffers from having non-unique solutions for a range of probability coefficients. * The skew log-Laplace model was proposed by Fieller, Gilbertson and Olbricht as a simpler alternative to the log-hyperbolic distribution. Rosin‚ÄìRammler distribution The Weibull distribution, now named for Waloddi Weibull was first identified by and first applied by to describe particle size distributions. It is still widely used in mineral processing to describe particle size distributions in comminution processes. :f(x;P_{\\\\rm{80}},m) = \\\\begin{cases} 1-e^{\\\\ln\\\\left(0.2\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{P_{\\\\rm{80}}}\\\\right)^m} & x\\\\geq0 , 0 & x<0 ,\\\\end{cases} where :x: Particle size :P_{\\\\rm{80}}: 80th percentile of the particle size distribution :m: Parameter describing the spread of the distribution The inverse distribution is given by: :f(F;P_{\\\\rm{80}},m) = \\\\begin{cases} P_{\\\\rm{80}} \\\\sqrt[m] {\\\\frac{\\\\ln(1-F)}{\\\\ln(0.2)}} & F>0 , 0 & F\\\\leq0 ,\\\\end{cases} where :F: Mass fraction =Parameter estimation= The parameters of the Rosin‚ÄìRammler distribution can be determined by refactoring the distribution function to the formWills, B.A. and Napier-Munn, T.J, Wills' Mineral Processing Technology: an introduction to the practical aspects of ore treatment and mineral recovery, , Seventh Edition (2006), Elsevier, Great Britain :\\\\ln\\\\left(-\\\\ln\\\\left(1-F\\\\right)\\\\right) = m\\\\ln(x)+ \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{-\\\\ln(0.2)}{(P_{\\\\rm{80}})^m}\\\\right) Hence the slope of the line in a plot of :\\\\ln\\\\left(-\\\\ln\\\\left(1-F\\\\right)\\\\right) versus \\\\ln(x) yields the parameter m and P_{\\\\rm{80}} is determined by substitution into :P_{\\\\rm{80}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{-\\\\ln(0.2)}{e^{intercept}}\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{m} See also *Particle size (general) *Sauter mean diameter one mathematical description of particle size * Granulometry (morphology) * Optical granulometry References Further reading *O.

Early life Maurice FitzGerald was born on 29 December 1774 to Robert FitzGerald, 17th Knight of Kerry (1717‚Äì1781) and his third wife, Catherine Sandes, the daughter of Lancelot Sandes. Upon his father's death in 1781, the seven year-old Maurice assumed the title of Knight of Kerry. In the Spring of 1848, English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson paid a visit to the 18th Knight of Kerry on Valencia Island, having procured a letter of introduction from Sir Maurice's cousin, the Limerick poet Aubrey Thomas de Vere. In a footnote in his father's memoir, Tennyson's eldest son Hallam Tennyson includes a letter from Bewicke Blackburne who was supervising Valencia Island's quarry at that time. Here Bewicke includes many interesting details of Tennyson's visit to Valencia, and comments about Sir Maurice (Hallam Tennyson, Tennyson, A Memoir, 1898, pp. 1:291-292). In addition, Aubrey T. de Vere also describes his cousin Sir Maurice in Hallam's memoir: \\"Alfred Tennyson's desire to see cliffs and waves revived, and we sent him to our cousin, Maurice FitzGerald, Knight of Kerry, who live at Valencia where they are seen at their best. . . . The next morning he pursued his way alone to Valencia. He soon wrote that he had enjoyed it. He had found there the highest waves that Ireland knows, cliffs that at one spot rise to the height of 600 feet, tamarisks and fuchsias that no sea-winds can intimidate, and the old 'Knight of Kerry,' who, at the age of nearly 80, preserved the spirits, the grace and the majestic beauty of days gone by -- as chivalrous a representative of Desmond's great Norman House as it had ever put forth in those times when it fought side by side with the greatest Gaelic Houses, for Ireland's ancient faith, and the immemorial rights of its Palatinate.\\" (de Vere qtd. in H. Tennyson, 1898, p. 1:291). Blackburne writes of Sir Maurice at the time of Tennyson's visit that: \\"[No one] will hardly have forgotten the old Knight of Kerry, the owner of the Island, his dignified presence and his redolence of Grattan and John Philpot Curran and Castlereagh and the Irish Parliament in which he sat for many years\\" (Blackburne qtd. in H. Tennyson, 1898, p. 1:292fn). Career FitzGerald represented Kerry in the Irish House of Commons from 1795 until the Act of Union in 1801. He sat also for Tralee in 1800. Travelling in Belgium during the Waterloo Campaign of 1815, he brought news of the impending Battle of Waterloo from Ghent to London. He was appointed joint Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1834 to 1835. Personal life On 5 November 1801, FitzGerald married Maria la Touche, the daughter of the Right Hon. David la Touche of Marlay in Dublin. Maria's brother was Peter La Touche (1775‚Äì1830), a Member of parliament in 1802‚Äì1806. Together, they had 10 children together: *Maurice FitzGerald (died 1836), unmarried. *David FitzGerald (died 1848), unmarried. *Robert FitzGerald (died 1835), married Ellen Hussey, eldest daughter Peter Bodkin Hussey of Farranikilla House, County Kerry. *Brinsley FitzGerald (died 1832), unmarried. *Sir Peter FitzGerald (1808‚Äì1880), who married Julia Hussey, another daughter of Peter Bodkin Hussey. *Stephen Edward FitzGerald (1816‚Äì?), who married Margaret Story, daughter of Rev.

The viaduct, built in 1836‚Äì7, was constructed for the opening of the Great Western Railway (GWR). It is situated between Southall and Hanwell stations, the latter station being only a very short distance away to the east. The viaduct was the first major structural design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the first building contract to be let on the GWR project, and the first major engineering work to be completed. It was also the first railway viaduct to be built with hollow piers, a feature much appreciated by a colony of bats which has since taken up residence within. Design Constructed of engineering brick, the viaduct has eight semi- elliptical arches, each spanning and rising . It is wide. The supporting piers are hollow and tapered, rising to projecting stone cornices that held up the arch centring during construction. When built, the viaduct was designed to carry two broad gauge tracks: the piers were wide at ground level and at deck level. The contractor was the partnership of Thomas Grissell and Samuel Morton Peto. The cost was ¬£40,000. The foundation works were carried out by William Brotherhood and his son Rowland. The young Charles Richardson also worked here under Brunel, as one of his first works for the Great Western. As travel by rail became more popular and rail traffic grew, pressure mounted to have an additional local line. Also, the Gauge Act of 1846 decreed that George Stephenson's (narrower) standard gauge should be the standard used for all railways across the country. Therefore, in 1877 the viaduct was widened by the addition of an extra row of piers and arches on the north side. Then in 1892 the broad gauge track was converted to standard gauge, and this allowed enough width for four standard gauge tracks.A History of the County of Middlesex (1962). Hanwell: Introduction.

The whole viaduct, viewed from the south Notice how the visual impact of the overhead electrification has been minimised by placing the supporting towers for the catenary on the alternate centre lines of the viaduct's columns, thus maintaining symmetry of form. On the central pier on the south side is a carving of the coat of arms of James Stuart Wortley Mackenzie, Lord Wharncliffe, who was chairman of the parliamentary committee that steered the passage of the GWR Bill through Parliament. Wharncliffe coat of arms First viaduct to carry telegraph Brunel was quick to see the possible advantages of the early electric telegraph system for use in running the railway. In 1838 he persuaded Sir Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke to install their five-needle telegraph system between Paddington Station and West Drayton and to carry out experiments.Archives in London ‚Äì Wheatstone (accessed 22 June 2007) It proved to be useful, so the viaduct thus carried the world's first commercial electrical telegraph, on 9 April 1839. Wharncliffe Viaduct, Hanwell ‚Äì c.1900 (looking south) At first, the seven-core cables were carried inside cast iron pipes, on short wooden spikes, a few feet from the side of the railway line. But from January 1843, the public were treated to the sight of telegraph wires against the sky line, across the top of the viaduct, for the first time. Cooke had renegotiated the contract with the GWR and extended the telegraph to Slough, using a simpler two-needle instrument that could be supplied with just two wires suspended from porcelain insulators on poles.Distant Writing ‚Äì Cooke & Wheatstone (Accessed 22 June 2007) On 16 May 1843 the Paddington-to-Slough telegraph went public, becoming Britain's first public telegraph service. Despite being something of a publicity stunt for Cooke, it became very popular, and HM Government were frequently using it for communication with the royal household at Windsor Castle nearby. In early 1845, John Tawell was apprehended following the use of a needle telegraph message from Slough to Paddington on 1 January 1845. This is thought to be the first use of the telegraph to catch a murderer. The message was: ::A murder has just been committed at Salt Hill and the suspected murderer was seen to take a first class ticket to London by the train that left Slough at 7.42pm. He is in the garb of a Kwaker with a brown great coat on which reaches his feet. He is in the last compartment of the second first-class carriage As the telecommunication traffic grew, the viaduct came to carry one of the trunk routes for the transatlantic cables, and more recently fibre-optic cables.Atlantic Cable Note the Egyptian styled columns Public recognition The viaduct was among the first structures to be listed, being defined as a Grade 1 listed building on 8 November 1949 (the legal framework for listing was introduced in 1947). Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, CBE, the historian of art and architecture, said of it, \\"Few viaducts have such architectural panache.\\"Pevsner N B L (1991). The buildings of England, London 3: North-West. It is one of the key locations in the bid for historic parts of the original GWR main line from Paddington to be recognised as a World Heritage Site.The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) The Great Western Railway: Paddington-Bristol (selected parts) Accessed 19 June 2007 On the nearby Uxbridge Road, an eighteenth-century coaching inn was renamed The Viaduct in its honour when the railway opened. This pub, which is itself listed as of local interest, still contains parts of the original stable block. Bat colony Bat Cave The hollow cavities within the structure of the supporting piers provide convenient roosting places for bats. These 'bat caves' have been given legal protection under the Countryside Act (1981). Bats are vulnerable to disturbance and the Act requires that only trained and licensed bat-workers may enter caves and other areas where bats roost. The Parks and Countryside Service of the London Borough of Ealing, in conjunction with Network Rail and the London Bat Group, have worked to safeguard the colonies by providing entrance grilles and hibernation shelters for each roost. It is not clear which species of bat is resident; indeed, there may be several. Identification usually requires capture and expert knowledge. However, the most likely candidate is Daubenton's bat ('), since this species forms colonies in caves, tunnels and under bridges, always near water (in this case, the River Brent), and is known to reside in other locations in west London. It is quite likely that this viaduct is the largest bat cave complex in the whole of London, and possibly the south of England, as no other roost approaching this size has so far been reported. Location The Wharncliffe Viaduct is best viewed from Brent Meadow on the south side, accessed from the Uxbridge Road, opposite Ealing Hospital. This is an area being maintained as a traditional hay meadow and is part of the Brent River Park. The river Brent has marked the boundary between Hanwell and Southall since before the Domesday Book. Time line ;1836 A large body of Irish men engaged in constructing the Great Western Railway went to The Stag beerhouse, where a few Englishmen had assembled, and a row commenced. Hearing that the Rev. Dr. Walmisley, the rector, had dispatched a messenger to Brentford for the police, their rage was diverted to that worthy magistrate, whom they threatened to sacrifice to their fury. Three prisoners were sentenced to two months in the House of Correction by the magistrates, who sent a letter to the Company, and stated that unless something was done, it would be necessary to apply to the Government for a body of police or military, to be stationed at Hanwell. ;3 May 1838 First trains run. The first locomotives to cross were the Vulcan and the Aeolus built by Tayleur and Co., of Warrington and the more famous North Star, built by Robert Stephenson and Company at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. ;4 June 1838 The line opened to the public.The Times, Saturday, 4 June 1938; pg. 9; issue 48012; col C ;1839 Trains on the new railway left Hanwell for Paddington every morning at 8 and 11 am, and at 3 and 7 pm; also westwards for Slough and Maidenhead, at 9:30 am, and at 1:30, 4:30, and 8:30 pm. Locally, it is often repeated to this day, that Queen Victoria so much enjoyed the view that she would have her train halt for a while on Brunel's spectacular viaduct over the river Brent. ;1847 The engine of an Exeter Express lost a tyre from a drive wheel, near Southall. It killed two passers-by and derailed a goods train on the other track. As this happened at high speed, the express was unable to stop until it had passed over the Wharncliffe Viaduct.Brunel University West London. Broad gauge trilogy . Accessed 23 June 2007 ;Second World War With the industrial base of Britain being so dependent on its railway system, the viaduct was considered a strategic target by the Germans. Local people still remember the many attempts made by the Luftwaffe to destroy the viaduct. Had they succeeded, it would have severed the arterial link into and out of the West London industrial estates for many weeks ‚Äì if not months. All raids, however, fell wide of their mark or the bombs failed to explode. ;24 November 2002 A First Great Western train from Swansea to Paddington, travelling at approximately , derailed shortly after it passed through a set of points close to Southall station. The train remained upright but travelled a further , passing an oncoming High Speed Train, through Hanwell station, and over Wharncliffe Viaduct before coming to a halt. There were no injuries to the 450 passengers on board, but the driver had to be treated for shock.

McIlroy was sacked in late November and was replaced by Chris Turner. Bailey made his league d√©but under Turner in the League One game against Chesterfield as an 89th minute substitute, replacing Mark Robertson. Bailey was sent out on loan to Conference National outfit Northwich Victoria for a month, making his d√©but at Carlisle United, a 1‚Äì0 defeat for Northwich. He played in five first-team matches for Carlisle without scoring. He was released by Stockport in May 2005. =Crewe Alexandra= Whilst on loan at Northwich Victoria, Bailey trained with Championship club Crewe Alexandra and scored twice in an under-18 game for The Railwaymen. This performance impressed manager Dario Gradi enough to earn him a one-year contract in May 2005. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, Bailey went out on loan to non-league clubs Hereford United, Southport and Lancaster City to gain first-team experience, but despite not breaking into the first team during the season and Crewe's relegation to League One, he was offered a one-year contract extension. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, Bailey found himself in a similar situation to the previous season, failing to break into the first team and being sent out on loan, to Barrow of the Conference North, for whom he appeared in ten matches. He was offered another one-year extension to his contract. Bailey made his Alexandra d√©but on 1 September 2007 in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Swindon Town, replacing Tom Pope in the 82nd minute. Change of position Bailey did not impress manager Dario Gradi as a striker. Gradi, who had trained the likes of David Platt and Dean Ashton in their early years, announced his intention to convert Bailey from a striker to a centre back. Gradi did not expect Bailey to push through and challenge as a first team centre back until the start of 2008. Bailey made his full debut for Alexandra away at Oldham Athletic in the second round of the FA Cup, where he played at centre back. Bailey went on loan to Weymouth for a month in March 2008; he made four appearances without scoring. When he returned to Crewe, Bailey did not feature in the team and he was released in May 2008; he played only times for Crewe. =Later career= Bailey rejoined Northwich Victoria in May 2008. He was loaned to Hinckley United in December 2008, scoring on his debut for the Conference North club. He joined AFC Telford United in August 2013. Shortly afterwards, he was sent on loan to Nantwich Town.

Design and development The DH.18 was designed and built in 1919 by Airco as their first aircraft specifically for commercial work, earlier aircraft such as the DH.16 being modified military types. The DH.18 was a single-engined biplane, powered by a Napier Lion engine with wooden two-bay, wire-braced wings, and a forward fuselage clad in plywood. It accommodated eight passengers in an enclosed cabin with the pilot in an open cockpit behind the cabin. The first prototype flew early in 1920.Donald, David, ed. The Encyclopedia of World Aircraft (London: Aerospace Publishing, 1997), p.311-312. DH.18A G-EARO of Instone Air Lines Operational history The first DH.18 was delivered to Aircraft Transport and Travel for use on the Croydon-Paris service, but was wrecked in a forced landing shortly after takeoff from Croydon on 16 August 1920.Jackson, A.J. British Civil Aircraft since 1919 Volume 2. London: Putnam, 1973. pp. 64‚Äì66. Two more aircraft were under construction by Airco for Aircraft Transport and Travel when the bankrupt Airco was purchased by BSA, who did not wish to continue aircraft development or production. Geoffrey de Havilland, the chief designer of Airco then set up the de Havilland Aircraft Company, completing the two partly completed aircraft as DH.18As, with improved engine mountings and undercarriages. Aircraft Transport and Travel closed down in early 1921, due to competition from subsidised French airlines. In March 1921, the British government granted temporary subsidies for airline services, with the Air Council purchasing a number of modern commercial aircraft for leasing to approved firms. The three ex-A.T.&T.; DH.18s were purchased in this way and leased to Instone Air Line. A further DH.18A was built to Air Council order, as were two modified DH.18B, which had fuselages that were entirely plywood- clad and had built-in emergency exits. The DH.18s were kept busy flying on continental air services for Instone, building up high flying hours. One aircraft, G-EAWO, was transferred to Daimler Airway for operation on the Croydon-Paris route until the de Havilland DH.34s which it had on order could be delivered. However, on 4 April 1922, two days after Daimler commenced operations with the aircraft, it collided with a Farman Goliath over Northern France, 62 mi (100 km) north of Paris, killing seven people, the first midair collision between airliners. The DH.18 was retired from commercial service in 1923, with one aircraft, G-EARO, having flown 90,000 mi (144,834 km) without accident. Two aircraft were used for test purposes, with one the subject of an Air Ministry experiment on how long an aircraft could stay afloat after being ditched, being deliberately landed on water off Felixstowe on 2 May 1924, floating for 25 minutes. The other remaining aircraft was used for test purposes at RAE Farnborough until 1927, when it was scrapped.

Suvorin suggested that the story should be published in Novoye Vremya, but Chekhov declined the offer. Later, upon having read the story, Suvorin asked to what extent did it reflect the author's own mental condition. \\"When the writer depicts a sick person it does not mean he is sick himself... Just wanted to portray a man suffering from delusions of grandeur. The image of a monk riding in the fields came to me in a dream, and as I woke up I told about to Misha\\", Chekhov replied in the 25 January 1894 letter. Chekhov discarded Max Nordau's ideas on the European intelligentsia's spiritual degeneration, but, perhaps inadvertently, quoted fragments from his 1892 book Degeneration at least twice in the story. According to Mikhail Chekhov, the story in many ways reflected Chekhov's experience in Melikhovo. It was here that he became seriously engaged in gardening. \\"Early in the morning he would... come into the garden and carefully inspect each tree, each shrub, perhaps to some trimming, or just stare at it, inspecting something.\\"Around Chekhov, p. 244 // –í–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ –ß–µ—Ö–æ–≤–∞, —Å—Ç—Ä. 244. Chekhov was often visited here by Ignaty Potapenko and Lika Mizinova. \\"Lika would sit at the grand piano and sing the then increasingly popular \\"L√©gende valaque\\" by Braga... a song in which a sick, delirious girl hears the angels singing and asks her mother to come to the balcony and tell her where these sounds might come from ... Anton Pavlovich liked this romance's mysticism and fine romanticism. I mention this because it was directly linked to the origins of the story The Black Monk,\\" Mikhail Chekhov wrote.Around Chekhov, pp. 257‚Äî258. Psychologically those were difficult days for Chekhov, who was suffering from anxiety and insomnia. \\"I would have eagerly flee to you in Petersburg, such are my moods, by cholera rages, twenty versts from here,\\" he wrote Suvorin on 28 July 1883, complaining about \\"deadly longing for some loneliness\\" and \\"horrid psychopathic moods\\". \\"...I don't think that I suffer from some psychological ailment. It's just that the will to live seems to have left me, although I don't think it's any kind of sickness, perhaps something transitory and trivial,\\" he wrote to Suvorin in January 1894. According to Mikhail Chekhov, \\"in Melikhovo Anton Pavlovich's nerves got completely out of order due to overwork, and he almost lost sleep. Once he'd start to fall into drowsiness, some strange force would throw him up.\\"Around Chekhov, p.257 It was during one such bad night that he had mental vision of a black monk. \\"It had the immense effect upon my brother, he won't be able to shake it off, returned to this monk in conversations from time to time and eventually wrote his well-known story about it.\\"Around Chekhov, p.260 This was also the time when Chekhov became deeply interested in psychiatry and became friends with doctor Vladimir Yakovenko, the founder and director of the best Russian psychiatric clinic of its time, in Meshcherskoye. \\"If you want to become a true writer, my darling, study psychiatry, this is quite necessary,\\" he was assuring Shchepkina-Kupernik, \\"...in those days when he was writing The Black Monk\\", according to her 1928 memoirs.–î–Ω–∏ –º–æ–µ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –ú., 1928, —Å—Ç—Ä. 317. In the summer of 1892 Max Nordau's book Degeneration was widely discussed in the Russian press. Chekhov thought little of Nordau's ideas,Letters to Suvorin, 24 March 1894, and Shavrova, 28 February 1895. but it might have left some impression upon him, for at least twice the Black Monk in his speeches quotes fragments from the chapter called \\"Genius and Crowd\\". Plot This story follows the character Andrey Kovrin, a Russian scholar who is seemingly brilliant. In the beginning of the story, Kovrin is overworked and his nerves are off. He is invited to take a break in the country at the home where he grew up. The place is gorgeous, with expansive gardens and orchards ‚Äì it is the lifework of Yegor, his former guardian, who lives and works there with his daughter, Tanya. When Tanya and Kovrin were children, Yegor became Kovrin's carer when both his parents died. Both think very highly of Kovrin and are very excited about his arrival. Kovrin learns how much work it is to take care of the garden, and develops a deep appreciation for it. Then he starts seeing a black monk, whose appearance borders on the supernatural, and begins to question his sanity. The black monk convinces Kovrin that he is chosen by God for a special purpose ‚Äì that he has the power to save mankind from millennia of suffering using his genius, and that his recent ill health of late is inevitable for someone making such noble sacrifices. The old man expresses to Kovrin that the only man he could trust to marry his daughter is Kovrin himself, convinced that any other man would take her away and his life's work would fall into ruin. They marry and, in time, Kovrin's wife notices his hallucinations, since he often converses with the black monk. She \\"cures\\" Kovrin over time, but he becomes convinced that without the black monk's \\"guidance\\", he is doomed to mediocrity instead of genius. He becomes bitter and antagonistic towards his loved ones, and eventually the couple splits up. His physical health deteriorating rapidly because of tuberculosis, he moves in with a woman who takes care of him. The story ends with Kovrin experiencing one final hallucination while he hemorrhages; the black monk guides him toward incorporeal genius and he dies with a smile. =Quotes= * \\"I exist in your imagination, and your imagination is part of nature, so I exist in nature.\\" (The Black Monk) * [\\"And what is the object of eternal life?\\" (Kovrin)]‚Äî\\"As of all life‚Äîenjoyment.

Mikhaylovsky was the first to recognise something much more than a mere psychiatry etude in \\"The Black Monk\\" After the publication of \\"The Black Monk\\" several Chekhov's correspondents wrote to him to express delight and gratitude, among them journalist Mikhail Menshikov, children's writer (and the owner of the Babkino estate) Maria Kiselyova and Ivan Gorbunov-Posadov. \\"I've read your Black Monk and all but lost my mind myself,\\" the clergyman Father Sergiy (S.A. Petrov) wrote to Chekhov on 8 May 1897. Gavrila Rusanov, Lev Tolstoy's friend and long-time correspondent, on 14 February informed Chekhov of how fond the latter was of the story (\\"It's wonder, just wonder!\\" he said).Gusev, N.N.

Chekhov's French translator Jules LegrasJules Legras (1866‚Äî1938), a professor of philology at the Bordeaux University history, was originally a German literature historian, but then became deeply involved with Russian culture, history and literature. He visited Russia in 1892, worked together with Korolenko in the typhoid-stricken regions of Nizhny Novgorod, met Tolstoy and Chekhov and became the latter's translator. In his letters Chekhov addressed him rather touchingly, with patronymic, Yuliy Antonovich (–Æ–ª–∏–π –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á). thought such a plotline would suit rather a novel, than novella. \\"[Potentially] it amounts to a vast novel about a highly educated, nervously agitated Russian man,\\" he wrote to Chekhov on 9 June 1895. Legras considered the story's second part to be more of a sketch, especially next to the 'well- painted' first one. To become a novelist, though, according to Legras, Checkov would need to \\"considerably change [his] maniere, stop being content with using these concise, finely chiseled phrases\\", to such great effect, \\"become more involved with what's going on\\", and \\"love the life\\" rather remain its \\"cruel observer\\".

Byers is most well known for his work as director of U.S. Weather Bureau's Thunderstorm Project in which, among other things, the modern cell morphology and life cycle of a thunderstorm were established. He is also known for his professional involvement with Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby and Tetsuya Theodore Fujita. During high school Byers developed a strong interest in journalism and worked as a reporter around the San Francisco Bay area, full-time for a year after graduation and then part-time while at the University of California, Berkeley. At university he became acquainted with science in the geography department and chose atmospheric sciences as his career. He graduated with an A.B. degree in geography in 1929, afterward studying meteorology under Rossby and Hurd C. Willett at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on a fellowship from the Daniel Guggenheim Fund, receiving his M.S. in 1932 with the thesis The Air Masses of the North Pacific. In 1934 he earned an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship to study meteorology, attaining his Sc.D. in 1935 with the dissertation The Changes in Air Masses During Lifting. Byers joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1940, eventually helping establish the Department of Meteorology. There he developed internationally renowned work during his 25-year tenure, about half of that as chairperson of the department, including work on cloud seeding with Louis J. Battan. In 1965 he moved to Texas A&M; University (TAMU) and was the first dean of geosciences until his retirement in 1974.

Left: Confocal recording of vacancies in diamonds. Single spots cannot be separated. Right: GSD recording of the same location. Single vacancies are clearly visible. The size of the pointlike vacancies, corresponding to the microscope's resolution, is about 15nm. Ground state depletion microscopy (GSD Microscopy) is an implementation of the RESOLFT concept. The method was proposed in 1995 and experimentally demonstrated in 2007. It is the second concept to overcome the diffraction barrier in far- field optical microscopy published by Stefan Hell. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds a resolution of up to 7.8 nm was achieved in 2009. This is far below the diffraction limit (~200 nm). Principle In GSD microscopy, fluorescent markers are used. In one condition, the marker can freely be excited from ground state and returns spontaneously via emission of a fluorescence photon. However, if light of appropriate wavelength is additionally applied the dye can be excited to a long-lived dark state, i.e. a state where no fluorescence occurs. As long as the molecule is in the long- lived dark state (e.g. a triplet state), it cannot be excited from the ground state. Switching between these two states (bright and dark) by applying light fulfills all preconditions for the RESOLFT concept and subwavelength scale imaging, and therefore images with very high resolution can be obtained. For successful implementation, GSD microscopy requires either special fluorophores with high triplet yield, or removal of oxygen by use of various mounting media such as Mowiol or Vectashield. The implementation in a microscope is very similar to stimulated emission depletion microscopy, however it can operate with only one wavelength for excitation and depletion. Using an appropriate ring-like focal spot for the light that switches the molecules into the dark state, the fluorescence can be quenched at the outer part of the focal spot. Therefore, fluorescence only still takes place at the center of the microscope's focal spot and the spatial resolution is increased.

He is the son of one of the greatest shooters to ever play in the PBA, Freddie Hubalde. Paulo plays the guard position. He was a former UE Red Warrior, playing alongside Paul Artadi, James Yap, Ni√±o Canaleta and Ronald Tubid. Hubalde was the lone draft by the San Miguel Beermen in 2005, probably a move if he can be an understudy for the aging Olsen Racela. His role diminished when the Beermen took in Brandon Cablay and played only eight games in that season in just five minutes a night of exposure. The 5-11 point guard saw himself reuniting with coach Jong Uichico with the Barangay Ginebra Kings in a multi-player trade in the early part of the season. However, he was a third stringer in the point guard rotation after the Kings signed veteran Johnny Abarrientos to be the chief backup of Jayjay Helterbrand. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, Hubalde was signed by the Barako Bull Energy Boosters, where he finally had the chance to prove his skills as an athletic point guard.RED BULL UNDERGOES REVAMP After the 2010‚Äì11 PBA Philippine Cup, he was acquired by the Beermen for a second stint. There he became a role player and helped the Cojuangco-owned franchise now known as the Petron Blaze Boosters win the 2011 PBA Governors' Cup against Talk 'N Text.

The locomotives were for hauling passenger services on branch lines. They had an 0-4-4 wheel layout and a total of 124 locomotives were built. They were designated G6 by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Rebuilds With the introduction of the NER Class O (LNER G5), BTP locomotives started to become redundant. Fifty of the redundant BTPs were rebuilt between 1899 and 1908 as NER Class 290 (later LNER Class J77) 0-6-0T locomotives. In 1903, locomotive No. 957 was rebuilt as a 2-2-4T (later designated LNER Class X2) specifically for hauling an officer's saloon. With the reduction in passenger services towards the end of World War I, many of the BTPs became redundant. In 1921, ten BTPs were rebuilt to create further NER Class 290 locomotives. Steam autocars Many class BTPs gained a further lease of life in the early 1900s by being converted to work the Steam Autocars (push‚Äìpull trains) then being introduced. A Steam Autocar consisted of a BTP with one or two coaches (in which case the engine was in the middle), the train was driven from a driving compartment in the leading coach, leaving the fireman on the footplate. The driver had control of the regulator and reverser by means of a mechanical connection running under the coach and connecting to the engine using a form of universal joints. The driver also had full (Westinghouse) brake control via a second air pipe connection to the engine. This high pressure air supply also worked a whistle mounted above the driving compartment. Finally there was speaking tube communication between the driver and fireman - although there is evidence that this was little used. Steam autocars were gradually withdrawn as the LNER introduced Sentinel steam railcars. The coaches were converted back to normal coaches but the BTPs were withdrawn. Withdrawal Withdrawals of the G6 took place between 1920 and 1929 and none is preserved.

It is typically part of the client side development process of creating a web page and/or web site, but is also used in the user interface design process of software development and game development. The process involves partitioning a comp in either a single layer [image file format] or the multi-layer native file format of the graphic art software used for partitioning. Once partitioned, one would save them as separate image files, typically in GIF, JPEG or PNG format in either a batch process or one at a time. Multi-layered image files may include multiple versions or states of the same image, often used for animations or widgets. Practical usage Slicing is used in many cases where a graphic design layout must be implemented as interactive media content. Therefore, this is a very important skill set typically possessed by \\"front end\\" developers; that is interactive media developers who specialize in user interface development. Slices may be produced and used in several different ways. Before tableless web design, sliced images were held together precisely with html tables. Modern interactive page layout includes extensive use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and semantic markup. Tables may be used for compatibility with rarer older web browsers that are incapable of processing modern tableless coding accurately. Slicing is exclusively used for bitmap images. Vector images are usually processed by media-playing plugin applications and contained within native multimedia file formats such as X3D, SWF, SVG or PDF files. Benefits Slicing reduces work loads and computer data storage space requirements to needing only the part of a dynamic image that changes instead of the whole image. If the slice is on a transparent multi-layered image, it can be reused in multiple parts of an image without changing the background. On the web, slicing breaks up one large image into many smaller ones, which reduces \\"page weight\\" or load time considerably. Advanced methods of slicing can be used to further compress the amount of data needed to download to the user's computer in order for the web page to display correctly. Techniques such as repeating background images mean that one small image can be downloaded from the web server only once and then be instructed (via a CSS) to repeat by the markup language, shifting the work load from the web server onto the client's computer. Certain performance issues can be raised, however they are typically negligible compared with today's technology and trends of web design shifting towards rich media websites that typically require high bandwidth connectivity and recent computing hardware. In offline electronic media, individually sliced sections of a 2D image can be used to decrease the local computer processing requirements to change a section of that image. Tools Quite a few industry standard programs offer the abilities to automatically slice a layout directly into tables using built in functions. These are outlined below: * Adobe Photoshop * Sketch * Adobe Fireworks (Previously published by Macromedia) * Adobe ImageReady (Discontinued after CS2, functionality from ImageReady ported into Photoshop since CS3) * GIMP * Jasc Paint Shop Pro Recent versions of these programs have improved ability to convert artwork directly into CSS, albeit an unorthodox method since the algorithms rely heavily on absolute positioning (for example), which can render (display) inconsistently across modern web browsers. Alternatives Slicing is mainly used for 2D computer graphics with single-layered interfaces. Multi-layered interfaces may use slices, but may also use vector graphics (including 3D models) with the drawback of added (most often unnoticeable) rendering time and with the advantage of more options and flexibility in altering the appearance of the individual image. These alternate individual images are commonly referred to as sprites.

Youth and early career Hayashi was born in Saiwai- ch≈ç, Tokuyama (since 2003 part of Sh≈´nan), Yamaguchi (Japan) on 5 March 1918, to a family running a photographic studio (Hayashi Shashin-kan, ).\\"Chronology\\", pp. 178, 179. This informative chronology is in parallel versions, Japanese and English, and is the basis of the biographical information here unless otherwise noted. The boy's mother, Ishi Hayashi (, Hayashi Ishi) was an accomplished photographer, particularly of portraits, taught by her father; his father, Shin'ichi Hayashi (, Hayashi Shin'ichi) was a mediocre photographer and a spendthrift; the boy's grandfather forced the parents to divorce and the boy grew up with his mother and surrounded by photography. He did well at school, where he took photographs. Hayashi graduated from school in 1935, and his mother determined that he would apprentice himself to the photographer Sh≈çichi Nakayama (, Nakayama Sh≈çichi). Nakayama was based in Ashiya, Hy≈çgo, but had a second studio in Shinsaibashi, Osaka. Hayashi did much running of errands between the two. On one occasion he passed the Ashiya studio of the photographer Iwata Nakayama late at night and was reinspired in photography by his realization of the effort Nakayama was putting in. A year later he contracted tuberculosis and returned to Tokuyama, where he enthusiastically practiced photography while recuperating, and participated in the group Neko-no-me-kai (, ‚ÄúCat's-Eye Group‚Äù) under the photographer Sakae Tamura using the name J≈çmin Hayashi (, Hayashi J≈çmin). In 1937 Hayashi went to Tokyo, where he studied at the Oriental School of Photography (, Orientaru Shashin Gakk≈ç), again under Tamura. On his graduation the following year, he returned to Tokuyama, but ‚Äúspent a year in dissipation, drinking heavily every night‚Äù.‚ÄùChronology‚Äù, p. 181. Yet he managed to retain his interest and prowess in photography. In 1939 his family decided to make a final allowance to him of ¬•200, which he quickly wasted in Tokyo on food and drink.Hayashi would continue to drink heavily. Midorikawa recalls how Hayashi, Akiyama and he ‚Äúoften ended up dead drunk‚Äù after nights out in ≈åmori in 1946. Ueda's memories corroborate this. Sait≈ç's are more alarming: contrary to Hayashi's claim that he spent eight hours on each of working, sleeping or drinking, Sait≈ç asserts that drinking was his main activity, incapacitating him -- until a camera was in his hands. Tamura got him a job in a developing and printing firm in Yokohama, where he worked at both printmaking and commercial photography. A few months later he moved to T≈çky≈ç K≈çgeisha () in Ginza, where he soon had an unexpected opportunity to demonstrate his unusual command, gained in Yokohama, of flash illumination. Demand for his services increased. He married Akiko Sasaki (, Sasaki Akiko), from Tokuyama. In 1940 Hayashi's photographs appeared in the photography magazine Shashin Sh≈´h≈ç, and the next year also the women's magazine Fujin K≈çron, and Asahi Camera. The couple had their first child, a son, Yasuhiko (). In 1942 Hayashi went to the Japanese embassy in Beijing, with the North China News Photography Association (, Kahoku K≈çh≈ç-shashin Ky≈çkai), which he had just cofounded. While in China he did a lot of work with what was then regarded as a wide-angle lens;A 35mm lens, which for a 24√ó36mm frame has a diagonal angle of view of 63¬∞; in the early twenty-first century, lenses such as this are commonly regarded as standard rather than wide. this led to his nickname of Waido no Ch≈´-san (, ‚Äúwide Mr Ch≈´‚Äù).Ch≈´ is an alternative reading of the tada within Tadahiko. (This incidentally is the ch≈´ of It≈çch≈´.) As recounted by ≈åtake. Ueda and Sait≈ç confirm that the name Ch≈´-san lingered after the war even when the reference to wide angle was dropped; Sait≈ç also mentions Matatabi no Ch≈´-san (), ‚Äúitinerant Mr Ch≈´‚Äù. Hayashi's photographs were published in the women's magazines Fujin K≈çron and Shinjoen and the photography magazines Shashin Bunka and Shashin Sh≈´h≈ç. The couple had their second son, Jun (), in 1943. Rotgut era Hayashi was still in Beijing at the end of the war. He returned to Japan with Jun Yoshida (, Yoshida Jun) in 1946. The family photo studio had been destroyed, but with Yoshida he set up a new studio, busily churning out photographs for twenty or more kasutori magazines (, kasutori-zasshi) (cheap, sensational and short-lived magazines) every month.Twenty or more: Chronology, p. 183. As Hayashi would later describe it, Yoshida would tell publishers that he photographed women, and Hayashi (later renowned for his portraits of men) would tell them that he photographed anything other than women.Sait≈ç, p. 131. The ploy seems to have worked: he was frenetically busy, and the photographer Sh≈çji Ueda later termed him ‚Äú[t]he first professional photographer in Japan‚Äù.Ueda, p. 129. He also found time to remarry in 1946, his second wife being Kane Watanabe (, Watanabe Kane); they had a son, Hidehiko (), in 1947. Always gregarious, Hayashi had friends and acquaintances among the buraiha (dissolute writers), and his portraits of Osamu Dazai and Sakunosuke Oda, both taken in the bar, are now famous.For Hayashi's ability to strike up friendships, see particularly Akiyama, p. 31. At the end of that year, the literary magazine Sh≈çsetsu Shinch≈ç published the first of Hayashi's series of portraits, titled Bunshi (literati), of ch≈´kan bungaku (), other writers and figures close to the world of literature, in its January 1948 issue; the series would continue until 1949 and was later collected into an anthology. Hayashi's portraits show their subjects in context, and the combination of their subject matter and the method by which he took them -- by his own account intermediate (ch≈´kan) between the tense, decisive style of Ken Domon and the relaxed, informal style of Ihei Kimura -- led them to be termed ‚Äúintermediate photographs‚Äù (, ch≈´kan shashin).Mitsuhashi, \\"Reappraisal\\", p. 13, quoting an interview with Hayashi published in 1983. The series of portraits that he was commissioned to take remained fresh; that of an unposed (and unsuspecting) Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki is particularly famous.Mitsuhashi, \\"Reappraisal\\", p. 25. Meanwhile, his portraits of orphans and the desperate but sometimes pleasurable life of the city were run in camera magazines, general-interest magazines, and more surprisingly in Fujin K≈çron; these too would be anthologized, first in 1980 in a book, Kasutori Jidai (, \\"The rotgut period\\"),Kasutori ‚Äúwas widely sold in the months immediately after Japan's surrender, when better alcoholic beverages were not available. Kasutori smelled like the rotgut it was, since it was made of the fermentable materials of the worst quality, but it did have one advantage: it was cheap. Thus kasutori came to symbolize the spirit and mores of the times. 'Kasutori Jidai' (Days in the Dregs) became a general term for that period after the war.‚Äù Mitsuhashi, \\"Reappraisal\\", p. 11. that has a lasting reputation as a historic document.Kat≈ç, p. 200. By 1954 Hayashi and the photographers Sh≈çtar≈ç Akiyama and Kira Sugiyama were sharing a studio in the basement of the Nihon Seimei Building, a dirty old building (subsequently demolished) in Hibiya (Chiyoda- ku). In the early 1950s, a strong trend toward photographing unaltered reality was fueled by manifestos in camera magazines by Ken Domon and others; Hayashi bucked this by arranging his photographs so that the whole and every part would form a flawless composition, staging if this were necessary. For this reason he is commonly regarded as very unlike a photographer such as Ihei Kimura.Composition, staging, widely perceived contrast with Kimura: Mitsuhashi, \\"Reappraisal\\", pp. 15-17\\\\. Mitsuhashi goes on to point out that the contrast is simplistic. In 1950 his fourth son was born.The boy's name was first Shigeru (); it was later changed to Yoshikatsu (). Through this period Hayashi was busily cofounding and participating in various organizations of photographers. Together with Eiichi Akaho (, Akaho Eiichi), Sh≈çtar≈ç Akiyama, Ry≈çsuke Ishizu, Y≈çichi Midorikawa and Sh≈çji Ueda, he was a founding member of Ginry≈´sha in 1947; the group would meet once every two months, for discussion and drinking. A year later he joined Ken Domon, Ihei Kimura, Shigeru Tamura and others in founding the Photographers' Group (, Shashinka Sh≈´dan), which would later become the Japan Photographers Association (, Nihon Shashinka Ky≈çkai). In 1953 he was a founding member of the photography section of Nika Society (, Nikakai shashinbu). America and later work In 1955 Hayashi accompanied Keiko Takahashi (, Takahashi Keiko), Japan's contender, to the Miss Universe contest in Florida; his photographs of the trips appeared in magazines. For decades thereafter they were little known, but forty were exhibited in a major posthumous retrospective, where they reminded viewers that Hayashi did not need to stage and excelled at the snapshot too; though his photographs still contrasted with Kimura's in the subjects' awareness of being photographed.The retrospective was that in the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in 1993; the observations are by Mitsuhashi, \\"Reappraisal\\", p. 21-3, who also quotes Tsutomu Watanabe (, Watanabe Tsutomu). He also appeared in the film J≈´ninin no shashinka (, Twelve photographers), directed by Hiroshi Teshigawara (, Teshigawara Hiroshi). Two years later, the first of Hayashi's books was published: Sh≈çsetsu no furusato (The village settings of stories) for which Hayashi traveled around Japan to the settings of novels and short stories, looking for and sometimes staging the scenes that are echoed in the fiction. It would be seven more years before his second book was published (a pace that was normal at the time), and the photographs that had made him famous in the kasutori period would only be anthologized from the 1980s. Hayashi's middle age had its setbacks. His wife died in 1961, his tuberculosis recurred in 1970, and his second son Jun died in 1973. But he continued to produce books, notably the lavish Nihon no gaka 108-nin, portraits of and representative works by 108 Japanese painters, which won both the Mainichi Arts Prize and the Japan Photographers Association's Annual Prize a year after its publication in 1977. In the early 1980s Hayashi traveled around Japan, taking photographs for a number of photo books. However, in 1985 he announced that he had cancer of the liver. This did not stop him from working: he embarked on work for a book of photographs for a book on the T≈çkaid≈ç, suggesting to Y≈çichi Midorikawa that Midorikawa should do another on the San'y≈çd≈ç. Hayashi survived publication of his own book by two months; Midorikawa's book only came out a year later.Midorikawa, p. 79. From 1980 until 1989 Hayashi was principal of the photographic academy Nihon Shashin Gakuen (). Hayashi's works are displayed by the Shunan City Museum of Art and History in Sh≈´nan, Yamaguchi.

Named City of Birmingham, it was delivered to British Airways, which operated it for 22 years. In March 2002, it was sold to operator European Aviation Air Charter which used it for holiday charters and ad-hoc flights as well as leasing it out for Hajj flights in 2003 and 2004. The company ceased 747 operations at the end of 2004 and the aircraft was sold to Air Atlanta Europe, which used it for charter flights until it was retired in 2005. Its last flight was on 25 May 2005, from London Gatwick Airport to nearby Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, England. The aircraft was bought by Aces High Limited, a company specialising in supplying aircraft for television and film work.

Among the modifications were the fitting of twin mock-up \\"B-52 style\\" engines on each of the inner engine pylons, with the outer ones instead holding mock-up external fuel tanks. The plane is featured in the background for British motoring show Top Gear, which is filmed in a hangar-turned-studio at Dunsfold. The plane is also featured in some of the show's challenges as background. It did feature most notably in one where the show's hosts were testing farm tractors and then-host Jeremy Clarkson pulled the modified 747 with his JCB farm tractor along the runway as part of a challenge. It was featured as part of a challenge in the Series 10 final of Scrapheap Challenge, where teams had to construct vehicles capable of towing the aircraft.

In 1644, he was one of the patentees of Hempstead under grant by Dutch Colonial Governor Willem Kieft. In 1645, Kieft granted the patent of Flushing to Lawrence and 16 others, which was confirmed by English Colonial Governor Richard Nicolls in 1666. In 1658, Lawrence removed to New Amsterdam. New Amsterdam was renamed New York on September 8, 1664, in honor of the Duke of York (later James II of England), in whose name the English had captured it. In 1663, he was appointed by Governor Pieter Stuyvesant as a Commissioner to negotiate with the General Court at Hartford to determine the boundary between New England and New Netherland.

The Boddington family held large estates in the West Indies and Samuel had been left a fortune by his father who had been a director of the South Sea Company as well as a West India merchant with offices at Mark Lane. In 1792 Samuel fell in love with a penniless orphan, Grace Ashburner, and in 1792 they were married. But Grace soon tired of her husband's quiet intellectual interests (Henry Fox rather unkindly referred to Samuel Boddington as \\"the arch-bore old Bod.\\") and eventually she eloped with his cousin Benjamin Boddington who had recently joined the family firm. Thereafter, Samuel approached his friend, Richard Sharp (politician), a fellow Dissenter, fellow member of the Fishmongers' Company, and both mutual friends of Samuel Rogers, asking if he would join him in business, and eventually a West India company of Boddington, Sharp and Philips (Sir George Philips, 1st Baronet) was established at 17 Mark Lane.

The aim of the program is to promote an understanding of international preservation policies, methods and techniques that lead to a continuing dialogue between countries. As of 2007, nearly 600 young preservation professionals and over 70 countries have participated in this program since its creation in 1984.US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program  Program Overview  The program began with a one-time exchange between US/ICOMOS and ICOMOS United Kingdom. It since has expanded to involve between 20 and 30 young preservation professionals each year. US/ICOMOS internships are geared toward individuals who are in their last year of a relevant graduate program or have been working for 1‚Äì3 years in a professional capacity. The program is very competitive in that only 1 in 5 applicants are awarded internships in any given year. Interns are selected on a competitive basis for participation in the US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program. Internships are approximately 12 weeks in length and are usually held during the summer (from June to August), although some internships may be held at other times of the year. US/ICOMOS hosts all U.S. and international interns for a program orientation in Washington, DC. Interns then disperse to their various host organizations where they complete a preservation-related project designed by the host organization. At the end of the summer, all interns reconvene in Washington, DC for a final farewell program. The program is made possible through generous grants from many U.S. foundations, government agencies and individual contributors, and ICOMOS National Committees of participating countries.  Intern Qualifications  Interns must be graduate students or young professionals with at minimum an undergraduate degree in a preservation-related field. Candidates are asked to submit a curriculum vitae, two letters of recommendation, a 500-word essay describing their reasons for wanting to participate in the program, and examples of their work. Participants are selected on the basis of skill, demonstrated commitment to historic preservation, previous experience and academic concentration in the field and the ability to represent their country in an exchange program. In addition, interns are chosen whose skills, training, interest and previous experience match the needs of host organizations. Applications submitted by U.S. citizens are selected for specific internships by a jury of professional members of US/ICOMOS; applications from other ICOMOS national committees are screened at the national committee level, and then forwarded to US/ICOMOS for selection and assignments. The file of the strongest candidate(s) for a particular internship is sent to the host office (in the U.S. and in participating countries) for review and final approval.

In September 1856 Coman became a volunteer firefighter when he joined Eagle Engine Company Number 13. He was soon elected Secretary, and in 1859 won election as Foreman. He was reelected annually until 1864 and was still in command when the volunteer fire department was replaced by a paid department in 1865. During the draft riots in 1863 Coman's fire company was among the fire units that performed law enforcement duties and aided the police and military in restoring order. A Democrat and member of the Tammany Hall organization, Coman served on the New York City Board of Aldermen from 1868 to 1871. As the board's president, he became acting mayor when John Thompson Hoffman resigned to become governor. A. Oakey Hall was elected to succeed Hoffman as mayor, and Coman served from Hoffman's resignation on December 1, 1868, until Hall's swearing-in on January 4, 1869. After he left his alderman's seat, Mayor Hall appointed Coman one of the commissioners to oversee construction of the New York County Courthouse. In 1873 Coman and the other commissioners were indicted for conspiracy related to the Tweed Ring's corruption in the construction of the courthouse. He was also sued in civil court with one of his fellow commissioners, with the city seeking to claim city money it said they had obtained by fraud. By 1876 the criminal case had ended with a Nolle prosequi decision by the district attorney, and the civil suit had been discontinued. Coman worked for The Equitable Life Assurance Society for more than twenty years, serving as a liaison to the city government responsible for resolving property tax disputes and code violations on company real estate, and assisting company executives in their dealings with city officials. In 1905 he testified in a New York State Legislature investigation into corruption in city government. His work for The Equitable was the subject of negative headlines, but he was not charged with any crimes. He died in New York City on October 22, 1909. His funeral took place at New York City's Church of the Blessed Sacrament. (Some sources indicate the date of death as October 20. This seems to be in error, and was probably the date Coman's final illness was first reported.) Coman was married to Martha Beechinor (d. July 19, 1920), and they were the parents of five children.

An endorheic alkaline lake, it is the second largest natural lake entirely in the state of California, United States. Ecology Eagle Lake is home to osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), from which it gets its name. Eagle Lake is the only watershed which supports native Eagle Lake trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss aquilarum). These rainbow trout grow to very large sizes, possibly having evolved to live longer as low flows often restrict spawning runs up their main spawning stream, Pine Creek. The average size of Eagle Lake trout are about and can exceed . Adults quickly grow to a size of in three years and can live for up to 11 years. Since these Modoc Lakes are high in alkalinity, the trout have evolved to be the only known trout subspecies capable of surviving in the alkaline waters of Eagle Lake. Eagle Lake Rainbow descendants, however, are planted with high success in many other lakes in California. These trout were once so abundant that there was a commercial fishery for them in the late 19th century. At the same time, extensive logging and heavy livestock grazing caused Pine Creek to change from a permanent to an intermittent stream in its lower reaches. In the early 1950s the few remaining eagle lake rainbow trout at the mouth of Pine Creek were rescued and used to start a hatchery program to maintain the species and the sport fishery. Because of the complete dependence of Eagle Lake rainbow trout on hatchery production, the American Fisheries Society considers it to be a threatened species and NatureServe has listed it as critically imperiled. Peter Moyle considers it to be one of the most endangered salmonids in California. However, a petition for listing the Eagle Lake rainbow trout as a threatened species was rejected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1994, and a similar petition was rejected by the California State Fish and Game Commission in 2004. From 2007 to 2009 Bogard Spring Creek, a tributary to Pine Creek, was electrofished to remove non- native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Non-native fish have not survived in the lake because of its high alkalinity, although in the early 1900s during a period of higher lake levels and falling alkalinity, Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and Brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) became abundant in the lake for some years. Historically American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) nested on Eagle Lake. They suffered from hunting by locals who mistakenly thought the pelicans ate the native trout and stopped nesting completely after 1932, when water was exported for agricultural irrigation and lowered the lake level by 3 meters, changing their nesting island into a less desirable peninsula (\\"Pelican Point\\"). Watershed and tributaries Eagle Lake was once part of a large lake on the Modoc Plateau millions of years ago. The modern lake is long by wide and is highly alkaline (pH 8-9). The lake consists of three basins, two of them averaging deep, the third averaging and reaching a depth of nearly . The tributaries of Eagle Lake (beginning in the lake's north end and going clockwise) are Cleghorn Creek, Papoose Creek, Merrill Creek, and Pine Creek. Pine Creek is the main tributary of Eagle Lake and is long. Now an intermittent stream; only the upper of Pine Creek has perennial flow. In 1923 the Leon Bly Tunnel was constructed to export lake water to the Honey Lake Valley via Willow Creek, a tributary of the Susan River. The long tunnel was cut through old lava flows but falling lake levels rendered it useless and a landslide partially blocked the tunnel entrance. However, a 1990 study found that lake water still flows through the tunnel although tunnel fish are from the Willow Creek assemblage. Image:Eagle Lake Shoreline 1.jpgThe lake just before dusk.

A fiscally conservative Whig, Brady entered politics as an opponent of the Tammany Hall Democratic organization. From 1842 to 1847 he served as Assistant Alderman and then Alderman. In 1847 he was a successful candidate for Mayor, capitalizing on a rift in Tammany and the third party candidacy of an anti-immigration nominee to score a narrow victory. He served until 1848. For his support of Zachary Taylor's winning campaign for President in 1848, Brady was rewarded in 1849 with appointment as Postmaster of New York City in which post he served until 1853.

He was born and raised in New York's \\"Hells Kitchen\\" and was educated by the Jesuits. His writing McCabe started as a police reporter for the New York American in 1936 and later worked for the Puerto Rico World-Journal, United Press and The San Francisco Examiner before joining the Chronicle in the mid-1950s. McCabe wrote a book called Tall Girls are Grateful which humorously reflected upon his love/hate relationship with women, and another called The Good Man's Weakness recording his wry thoughts on drinking, the other love/hate relationship in his life. Another book was a biography of his grandfather-in-law, the newspaper man, E. W. Scripps, who was also principal founder and supporter of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Scripps Foundation. There is also a compilation of his essays put together in the book The Fearless Spectator by Chronicle Books (1970) His newspaper column McCabe was renowned in San Francisco for his satirical newspaper column in the Chronicle under the byline \\"The Fearless Spectator\\", and for his robust social life centered on the many \\"watering holes\\" he frequented. While at the Chronicle, his boss Scott Newhall assigned him to do a column for the sports section of the newspaper. McCabe knew little about sports and had virtually no interest in the subject. Newhall dubbed him the \\"fearless spectator\\" and took publicity photographs of McCabe perched on a shooting stick, wearing a derby and looking bored.Arthur Hoppe Having a Wonderful Time: My first half century as a newspaperman Initially the column was placed in the sports section but having little if anything to do with sports it was eventually moved to the features section. A black and white icon of McCabe in the bowler hat always sat next to the title of his column \\"The Fearless Spectator\\". McCabe would arrive at the Chronicle offices at 5th and Mission at what his colleagues called the \\"ungodly hour\\" of 8AM. He would feverishly type up his column and then leave before 9AM to get his breakfast of five or six \\"Green Deaths\\" at Gino and Carlo, a bar in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood. =His replies to letters from his readers= McCabe professed little interest in what his readers wrote to him. His editorial assistant, Mike Brown, would write touching or apologetic replies to most if not all of the letters. It is interesting that many people still remember the beautiful letters and indicate that the letters formed their opinion about McCabe yet he never read nor wrote any of them. =Political views= McCabe as previously noted was a satirical journalist. While there were sometimes underlying political implications in his columns, it was not common. In the late 1950s, US Steel proposed to build a huge building (the US Steel Tower) near the Embarcadero and towering 80 feet higher than the West Tower of the nearby Bay Bridge. Both McCabe and Herb Caen another SF Chronicle columnist wrote strongly against its construction.Peter Booth Wiley \\"National Trust Guide - San Francisco\\" The project was eventually abandoned. His watering holes McCabe was a frequent imbiber at his favorite bar Gino and Carlo,SF Examiner article in North Beach where he enjoyed his \\"Green Death\\"; at Mooney's Irish Pub for the Irish whiskey and conversation; and sometimes at Dino and Carlo's Bar, also in North Beach for the dark beer, music, and a monthly get together with his friend Ron Small.Gino and Carlo and Dino and Carlo's are different establishments. Gino and Carlo is on Green Street, still open and has existed for over 50 years. Dino and Carlo's was on Vallejo and only existed for a brief period in the mid 1960s =Green Death= Green Death was the nickname for Ranier Ale. This was McCabe's favorite beer and he often wrote about his fondness for the brew in his column.Alan LaGreen \\"Charles McCabe and the Green Death After his death, his friend Denis Prescott poured a bottle of the brew over the side of the cruise ship the Santa Maria in memory of McCabe. McCabe traveled on the Santa Maria frequently and was well known and liked by the ship's crew. They stopped the ship and announced the event just prior to the ceremonial pouring Notes from conversations with Mike Brown and Carl Nolte =Chocolate Surprise= \\"I went to Dino and Carlo's barRon Small confirmed it was Dino and Carlo's not Gino and Carlo's in North Beach every so often with my friend Ron Small. Ron would frequently meet there with an older guy who I was told worked at the SF Chronicle and on one occasion this Mr. Charles McCabe and I were sitting there waiting for Ron to arrive. Ron eventually showed up accompanied with the scruftiest looking person I had ever seen. This other guy looked like a unwashed biker. He wore a helmet that reminded me of a Nazi WW2 military helmet. The Grateful Dead were becoming popular around this time and I flashed that this must be \\"PigPen\\" from their band. I moaned \\"good god\\" Mr. McCabe said nothing just looked amused. Ron introduced our latest friend as George. Upon closer inspection he was neither dirty nor scruffy, just unshaved. McCabe asked what he was drinking. Ron quickly said - \\"like you Charlie, he doesn't like the beer here - I bring stuff for him\\" and pulled out a quart container of chocolate milk. George thanked Ron, quaffed down a good pint and then we all began to talk. Later I learned this was the Hell's Angel biker Chocolate George. I also learned that the milk carton contained only half chocolate milk and the other half some unspecified hard stuff. McCabe said that there was now a new name among the drinks that he might write about. First \\"Green Death\\" and now \\"Chocolate Surprise\\".N.C. Demet \\"A Belgian's view about life in San Francisco\\" His family McCabe had four children with Peggy Scripps McCabe: Margaret Ellen \\"Nini\\" McCabe, Charles K.

He died of a severe concussionAl Young \\"Something about the Blues\\" His obituary More than 400 friends, colleagues and faithful readers gathered at St. Francis of Assisi Church in North Beach on May 4 for a final farewell to Charles McCabe, the stylish essayist who wrote a popular column for the Chronicle for nearly 25 years. The Mass of Resurrection was celebrated by his friend John M. Ring, pastor of Our Lady of Carmel Church in Mill Valley, who praised the writer for having \\"a restless heart and mind and spirit, which were his greatest gifts.\\" \\"Charles couldn't stand anything phony, whether it be presidents, governors, oily-tongued clergymen or razor blades,\\" the priest told a group that included socialites, journalists and many blue-collar drinking buddies. The Mass was planned in accordance with McCabe's will, in which he asked that the music at his funeral include Bach's \\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\" and that three Shakespeare sonnets be read by his friend and attorney, Carlos Bea.New York Times May 5, 1983 Notable quotes McCabe was also known for his satirical sayings. One of his more notable quotes was \\"Any clod can have the facts, but having opinions is an art.\\" Another was \\"McCabe's Law: Nobody has to do anything.\\" His colleagues \\"This was a sort of \\"golden age\\" at the Chronicle.

He was, at various times and circumstances, a farmer, a land agent and a politician. Lawson was born near Muthill, Scotland and became a flax farmer in Perthshire. He was recommended in 1769 to James William Montgomery, Scotland's lord advocate, who was the owner of the township of Lot 34 in the new British colony of St. John's Island (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1799). Lawson recruited about 50 indentured servants in Perthshire and embarked with his family on the Falmouth from Greenock on 8 April 1770. The Falmouth arrived on 8 June 1770 in Stanhope (named after Montgomery's Scottish estate) after a difficult voyage. As a land agent, Lawson found himself in dispute with James William Montgomery, Scotland's lord advocate, who had funded the settlement group. Lawson's activity in politics included elected membership in the Prince Edward Island House of Assembly between 1773 and 1785. In 1788 he was evicted by Montgomery for refusing to handle his landlord duties and later successfully sued during the 1790s for damages. Montgomery eventually forgave Lawson's debt and paid him a stipend so that he could continue to live at his home in Covehead. His name disappears from records after 1803.

Career In 1725, Bayard wrote to Robert Livingston stating that 30 slaves died on a voyage to the colony due to a shortage of food and that Moses Levy was awaiting payment of Livingston's account. On September 29, 1744, Bayard was appointed the 39th Mayor of New York City for three consecutive one-year terms until 1747. During his first year in office, he took steps to found a college in New York City, feeling that New Yorkers had neglected the interests of education. He initiated the raising of ¬£2,250 for the foundation of a college, which was completed 10 years later and became King's College. In May 1745, his government prohibited skinners, leather dressers, and curriers from neighborhoods below the Collect and prohibited hatters and starch makers from pouring waste into the streets. =Hoboken= Bayard had country estate and farm at Castle Point, called Hoboken, in Bergen County, New Jersey.

Early life Born and raised in Los Angeles, Pettit graduated from Narbonne H.S. in Harbor City, California. He was known as the \\"Wizard of Whiff.\\" As an amateur--in high school, for the semipro Signal Oilers--he pitched six no-hitters, three of them in a row, and struck out 945 batters in 549 innings. In one 12-inning high school game, he struck out 27 batters. In 1949, movie producer Frederick Stephani was looking to make a baseball movie but could not afford the story of an established star. Instead, Stephani scouted high school athletes with major league prospects, and eventually signed Pettit for $85,000. Upon his graduation in 1950, Pettit was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates, who bought his contract from Stephani (though Stephani retained film rights), plus an additional $15,000. This $100,000 sum () was a new record, and made Pettit baseball's first six-figure bonus baby. Professional career Pettit started his career in New Orleans with very high prospects, spending the remainder of the 1950 season with the Pelicans with the clear expectation that he would be brought up to the Pirates the following season. Sent up to the Pirates in 1951, Pettit pitched 2.2 innings with a 3.38 ERA, with no decisions. Although his performance was disappointing, it is not considered to have been the result of a lack of talent or an error on the part of the scouts, but was mainly due to an arm injury. In 1952, playing for the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, Pettit was 15‚Äì8 with an ERA of 3.70. He also batted .320. Pettit returned to the Pirates in 1953; in 28 innings, he was 1‚Äì2, with an ERA of 7.71. As a hitter, Pettit was 2 for 8 for a batting average of .250. At the start of the 1954 season, the arm injury became impossible to ignore. Pettit was eventually forced to give up pitching and was sent down to the Salinas Packers of the California League, where he played outfield. In 1954, he hit .324 with 20 home runs and 102 RBIs. In 1955, playing for the Azules de Veracruz of the Mexican League, he hit .382. In 1957, Pettit returned to the Hollywood Stars, replacing future Pirate Slugger Dick Stuart. Pettit hit .284 with 20 home runs and 102 RBIs. On September 12, 1957, he had 10 RBIs against the Seattle Rainiers. By 1958, Pettit's arm problems had become so bad that he was moved to first base. Pettit retired in 1961. Personal life Pettit married Shirley Joan Jennings in January 1951. The couple had six children: Paul, Mark, Tim, Michael, Stephanie, and Cindy. Pettit attended college during his baseball career, and by the time he stopped playing, earned a degree in Physical Education from Cal State Long Beach. He began teaching and coaching high school baseball in 1962. He managed the minor league Dubuque Royals in 1968, after which he returned to coaching high school baseball in Lawndale, California. Pettit died on September 24, 2020, at the age of 88.

History  The Hospitality Technology Next Generation was founded in 2002 under the name Hotel Technology Next Generation. it was officially founded by Douglas Rice. Nine hotel IT executives actually formed the core of the founding members. At that time, hotels sometimes had 50 different systems that were not inter- operable. HTNG estimated in 2005 that $25 billion was spent annually and worldwide by hotel companies in IT solutions. In 2013, HTNG released a secure payments framework for hotels, but mentioned it would be efficient only if the whole industry were to use it. Still in 2013, HTNG signed a partnership agreement with China Hospitality Technology Alliance to share data across continents. In January 2015, Smartrac joined the HTNG to work on the door lock security group of the organization. The Hospitality Finance, Revenue Management and IT Professionals Association (HOSPA) also joined the HTNG, starting with HOSPOA-member Royal Automobile Club. In 2016, HTNG partnered with the magazine Hospitality Technology to merge their hospitality-focused conferences in North America. In June 2017, Hotel Technology Next Generation changed its name to Hospitality Technology Next Generation. In August 2018, HTNG published a white paper regarding for the implementation of voice technologies in hotels. In September 2018, HTNG signed a partnership agreement with Hospitality Financial and Technology Professionals (HFTP) to share development resources. Starting in 2019, the OpenTravel Alliance joined its relationship management with HTNG.  Description  The Hospitality Technology Next Generation is governed by a board of directors consisting of senior technology executives from hotel companies. Membership is open to companies and individuals involved with hospitality technology. The organization's stated objective is to promote interoperability of the many technology systems used in the hotel industry, such as property management systems, point-of-sale systems, telephone systems, building automation systems, guestroom entertainment systems such as video on demand, security and access control systems, and many others. The organization's members meet regularly in small workgroups, where hotel companies and vendors work together to design interface standards (often using XML), reference architectures, network designs, and hospitality-specific network devices. HTNG holds annual members' meetings in North America, Europe, and Asia. HTNG operates a certification program for selected specifications, administered by The Open Group.  Governance  In May 2015, Raman P. Rama was named on the board of HTNG. In June 2015, Michael Blake was named EVP and CEO of HTNG, replacing Douglas Rice who led the organization for 13 years.

He wrote at the start of the 20th century, when the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work, had created turmoil over Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. He was also very influenced by the writings of Herbert Spencer regarding evolution and society, and of Benjamin Kidd regarding society and religion. He emphasises the impossibility of liberalism, which recommends individual freedom insofar as it does not restrict the individual freedom of others. The objection, he says, is that it is inconsistent with competition. Liberalism, he says, is not possible in the context of evolutionary theory, given man's ceaseless urge for expansion which conflicts with the idea of equality for all. In reality, he claims, the superior group or class always oppresses the inferior masses, who eventually revolt. All revolutions result simply in the replacement of the ruling class by a new ruling class. He refers to the German concept of Rechtsstaat, and his ideas reflect the prominence of social Darwinism of the time. Chatterton-Hill spent World War I in Germany out of Irish nationalist sentiment and corresponded with Roger Casement. He was said to have worked for German politician Matthias Erzberger as his private secretary according to Charles Curry's book and described there also as \\"born in Ceylon of an Irish father and native mother but never to have put foot on Irish soil\\".pp 219-226, Charles Curry, 'Sir Roger Casement‚Äôs Diaries - His Mission to Germany and the Findlay Affair', Arche, Munich, 1922; http://www.irishbrigade.eu/other- men/chatterton-hill/chatterton-hill.html \\"He was ... married to a German lady, and lived in Germany for some time prior to the outbreak of [the Second World War].

Col. David Provost or David Provoost (January 16, 1670 ‚Äì 1724) was the 24th Mayor of New York City from 1699 to 1700. Early life David Provost was born at his family's Pearl Street home, near Fulton Street, in New York, New York, on January 16, 1670, to David Provost Sr. (1645‚Äì1720), one of New Amsterdam's Dutch burghers, and Tryntje \\"Catherine\\" (n√©e Laurens) Provost (1650‚Äì1707). Career In 1699, David Provost was appointed Mayor. During his administration, two new market houses were erected, one at Coenties Slip and the other at the foot of Broad Street. A hospital-home for the poor was established. Public street cleaners were hired, and homeowners were directed to pave in front of their houses or face fine of twenty shillings. The ferry to Long Island was contracted out for a term of seven years at a rent of one hundred and sixty-five pounds sterling per year. By the conditions of lease, the lessee was required to keep two large boats for corn and cattle, and two smaller boats for passengers. The city engaged to build a ferry-house on Nassau or Long Island, which the ferry operator was required to keep in repair. In 1699, the firing of guns within New York City was strictly forbidden. A powder-house was ordered to be built for public use, and all persons were prohibited from keeping more than fifty pounds of powder in their house. A tax was levied on all flour and bread brought into the city. This tax, however, proved unpopular, and was annulled a few weeks later. Provost was succeeded in office by Isaac De Reimer in 1700. After his tenure as Mayor, Provost served for a time as alderman. Personal life On June 1, 1691, Provost married Helena Byvanck (d. 1698) of Albany. Together, they were the parents of: * Belitje Provost (b. 1692), who married Henry Coens * Catharina Provost (b. 1694), who married Abraham Van Wyck (1695‚Äì1756) * David Provost III (b. 1695), who married Johanna Rynders. * Helena Provost (b. 1698), who married Cornelius Santvoort (b. 1692) After her death, married Maria De Peyster (1659‚Äì1700) on January 28, 1699, the sister of his predecessor as Mayor, Johannes de Peyster, widow of John Spratt. Her daughter, Maria Spratt (1693‚Äì1760) was married to James Alexander (1691‚Äì1756), Attorney General of New Jersey. After her death, he married for the third time on May 15, 1708, to Elizabeth Wakeman (b. 1657), widow of Albert Dinny, of Fairfield, Connecticut. He died in 1724 and his will probated on January 27, 1724.

The song was one of DC5's top hits, reaching number 5 on the UK Singles Chart in the late summer of 1965 and number 4 on the U.S. pop singles chart, later that fall. Starting with guitar and finger snapping accompaniment, the hook was instantaneous: :Here they come again, mmmm-mm-mm :Catch us if you can, mmmm- mm-mm :Time to get a move on, mmmm-mm-mm :We will yell with all of our might! : [drums kick in] :Catch us if you can ... As such, it served as the title song to John Boorman's well-regarded DC5 vehicle and pop scene film Catch Us If You Can (retitled Having a Wild Weekend in the U.S.) of the same year. The title phrase was seemingly a take-off on the 1959 crime film Catch Me If You Can and similar phrases, with \\"me\\" turned to the group's \\"us\\". In years since, \\"Catch Us If You Can\\" is played near the start of Shrewsbury Town F.C. matches as the footballers run onto the pitch. This has been happening on and off since the 1974-1975 season and \\"Catch\\" is thus seen by home fans as Shrewsbury's de facto theme tune. Such was its significance to Shrewsbury Town that a local band, Hello Cleveland, and Shrewsbury fans released a cover version of the song, with a percentage of the proceeds going to children's charity Hope House. The song was made available for purchase on Amazon and on the club's official shop webpage. In the U.S., \\"Catch\\" remains one of the DC5's most played tunes on oldies radio stations. In Australia, the Candid Camera-style television show Catch Us If You Can was named after the song. Author Emlyn Williams used this song's lyric as an epigraph in Beyond Belief, his book about the serial killers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. \\"Catch Us If You Can\\" was a hit song on British radio during part of the time the Moors murders were being committed. The song was also used in a Walkers advert in 1995 around May (when the song was thirty years old) for their now discontinued (but new at the time) crinkle-cut range (featuring three flavours: Cream Cheese & Chive, Cheese & Ham and Roast Beef & Mustard); the song seemed appropriate as it was saying \\"catch us crinkle cut crisps if you can\\". (The off-screen voice-over, as for all Walkers crisps commercials then, was Hugh Laurie.) The song was also featured in the opening sequence of the ESPN broadcast of the 1989 Winston 500 NASCAR race held at Talladega Superspeedway. \\"Catch Us If You Can\\" was also used for video clips of baseball highlights on The George Michael Sports Machine. The song was also used in the opening sequence of the TBS broadcast of the 1987 NBA Playoffs between the Los Angeles Lakers against the Seattle SuperSonics in Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals. It is also used in the opening credits of the 1990 movie Look Who's Talking Too, when baby Julie is conceived.

Biography Gaetano Bisleti was born in Veroli, Italy. He was educated at the Seminary of Tivoli and the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles, where he obtained a doctorate in theology in 1879. Bisleti was ordained on 20 September 1878. He was appointed Canon and archdeacon of the cathedral chapter of Veroli where he served until 1884.

Indo-Roman trade relations (see also the spice trade and incense road) was trade between the Indian subcontinent and the Roman Empire in Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. Trade through the overland caravan routes via Asia Minor and the Middle East, though at a relative trickle compared to later times, antedated the southern trade route via the Red Sea and monsoons which started around the beginning of the Common Era (CE) following the reign of Augustus and his conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE. The southern route so helped enhance trade between the ancient Roman Empire and the Indian subcontinent, that Roman politicians and historians are on record decrying the loss of silver and gold to buy silk to pamper Roman wives, and the southern route grew to eclipse and then totally supplant the overland trade route. Roman and Greek traders frequented the ancient Tamil country, present day Southern India and Sri Lanka, securing trade with the seafaring Tamil states of the Pandyan, Chola and Chera dynasties and establishing trading settlements which secured trade with the Indian subcontinent by the Greco-Roman world since the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty a few decades before the start of the Common Era and remained long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.Curtin 1984: 100 As recorded by Strabo, Emperor Augustus of Rome received at Antioch an ambassador from a South Indian king called Pandyan of Dramira. The country of the Pandyas, Pandi Mandala, was described as Pandyan Mediterranea in the Periplus and Modura Regia Pandyan by Ptolemy.The cyclop√¶dia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia By Edward Balfour They also outlasted Byzantium's loss of the ports of Egypt and the Red SeaHoll 2003: 9 (c. 639‚Äì645 CE) under the pressure of the Muslim conquests. Sometime after the sundering of communications between the Christian Kingdom of Axum and the Eastern Roman Empire in the 7th century, the Kingdom of Axum fell into a slow decline, fading into obscurity in western sources. It survived, despite pressure from Islamic forces, until the 11th century, when it was reconfigured in a dynastic squabble. Communications were reinstated after the Muslim forces retreated. Background thumbright500pxThe Seleucid and the Ptolemaic dynasties controlled trade networks to India before the establishment of Roman Egypt. The Seleucid dynasty controlled a developed network of trade with the Indian Subcontinent which had previously existed under the influence of the Achaemenid Empire. The Greek-Ptolemaic dynasty, controlling the western and northern end of other trade routes to Southern Arabia and the Indian Subcontinent,Potter 2004: 20 had begun to exploit trading opportunities in the region prior to the Roman involvement but, according to the historian Strabo, the volume of commerce between Indians and the Greeks was not comparable to that of later Indo-Roman trade. The Periplus Maris Erythraei mentions a time when sea trade between Egypt and the subcontinent did not involve direct sailings.Young 2001: 19 The cargo under these situations was shipped to Aden: The Ptolemaic dynasty had developed trade with Indian kingdoms using the Red Sea ports.Shaw 2003: 426 With the establishment of Roman Egypt, the Romans took over and further developed the already existing trade using these ports. Classical geographers such as Strabo and Pliny the Elder were generally slow to incorporate new information into their works and, from their positions as esteemed scholars, were seemingly prejudiced against lowly merchants and their topographical accounts.Parker 2008: 118. Ptolemy's Geography represents somewhat of a break from this since he demonstrated an openness to their accounts and would not have been able to chart the Bay of Bengal so accurately had it not been for the input of traders. It is perhaps no surprise then that Marinus and Ptolemy relied on the testimony of a Greek sailor named Alexander for how to reach \\"Cattigara\\" (most likely Oc Eo, Vietnam, where Antonine- period Roman artefacts have been discovered) in the Magnus Sinus (i.e. Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea) located east of the Golden Chersonese (i.e. Malay Peninsula).Young 2001: 29.Mawer 2013: 38. In the 1st-century CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, its anonymous Greek-speaking author, a merchant of Roman Egypt, provides such vivid accounts of trade cities in Arabia and India, including travel times from rivers and towns, where to drop anchor, the locations of royal courts, lifestyles of the locals and goods found in their markets, and favorable times of year to sail from Egypt to these places in order to catch the monsoon winds, that it is clear he visited many of these locations. Early Common Era Silver denarius of Tiberius (14‚Äì37 CE) found in India. Indian copy of the same, 1st century CE. Coin of Kushan king Kujula Kadphises copying a coin of Augustus. Indian ship on lead coin of Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi, 1st‚Äì2nd century CE Prior to Roman expansion, the various peoples of the subcontinent had established strong maritime trade with other countries. The dramatic increase in the importance of Indian ports, however, did not occur until the opening of the Red Sea by the Greeks and the Romans' attainment concerning the region‚Äôs seasonal monsoons. The first two centuries of the Common Era indicate a marked increase in trade between western India and the Roman east by sea. The expansion of trade was made possible by the stability brought to the region by the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus (r. 27 BCE‚Äì14 CE) which allowed for new explorations and the creation of a sound silver and gold coinage. . The west coast of present-day India is mentioned frequently in literature, such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The area was noted for its strong tidal currents, turbulent waves and rocky sea-beds were dangerous for shipping experience. The anchors of ships would be caught by the waves and quickly detach to capsize the vessel or cause a shipwreck. Stone anchors have been observed near Bet Dwarka, an island situated in the Gulf of Kachchh, from ship lost at sea. Onshore and offshore explorations have been carried out around Bet Dwarka Island since 1983. The finds discovered include lead and stone objects buried in sediment and considered to be anchors due to their axial holes. Though it is unlikely that the remains of the shipwreck‚Äôs hull survived, offshore explorations in 2000 and 2001 have yielded seven differently-sized amphoras, two lead anchors, forty-two stone anchors of different types, a supply of potsherds, and a circular lead ingot. The remains of the seven amphoras were of a thick, coarse fabric with a rough surface, which was used for exporting wine and olive oil from the Roman Empire. Archeologists have concluded that most of these were wine amphoras, since olive oil was in less demand in the subcontinent. A coin of Trajan, found together with coins of the Kushan ruler Kanishka, at the Ahin Posh Buddhist Monastery, Afghanistan. Since the discoveries at Bet Dwarka are significant for the maritime history of the region, archeologists have researched the resources in India. Despite the unfavorable conditions the island is situated in, the following items have made Bet Dwarka as well as the rest of western India an important place for trade. From Latin literature, Rome imported Indian tigers, rhinoceros, elephants, and serpents to use for circus shows ‚Äì a method employed as entertainment to prevent riots in Rome. It has been noted in the Periplus that Roman women also wore Indian Ocean pearls and used a supply of herbs, spices, pepper, lyceum, costus, sesame oil and sugar for food. Indigo was used as a color while cotton cloth was used as articles of clothing. Furthermore, the subcontinent exported ebony for fashioned furniture in Rome. The Roman Empire also imported Indian lime, peach, and various other fruits for medicine. Western India, as a result, was the recipient of large amounts of Roman gold during this time. Since one must sail against the narrow gulfs of western India, special large boats were used and ship development was demanded. At the entrance of the gulf, large ships called trappaga and cotymba helped guide foreign vessels safely to the harbor. These ships were capable of relatively long coastal cruises, and several seals have depicted this type of ship. In each seal, parallel bands were suggested to represent the beams of the ship. In the center of the vessel is a single mast with a tripod base. Apart from the recent explorations, close trade relations, as well as the development of ship building, were supported by the discovery of several Roman coins. On these coins were depictions of two strongly constructed masted ships. Thus, these depictions of Indian ships, originating from both coins and literature (Pliny and Pluriplus), indicate Indian development in seafaring due to the increase in Indo-Roman commerce. In addition, the silver Roman coins discovered in western India primarily come from the 1st, 2nd, and 5th centuries. These Roman coins also suggest that the Indian peninsula possessed a stable seaborne trade with Rome during 1st and 2nd century AD. Land routes, during the time of Augustus, were also used for Indian embassies to reach Rome. The discoveries found on Bet Dwarka and on other areas on the western coast of India strongly indicate that there were strong Indo-Roman trade relations during the first two centuries of the Common Era. The 3rd century, however, was the demise of the Indo-Roman trade. The sea-route between Rome and India was shut down, and as a result, the trading reverted to the time prior to Roman expansion and exploration.

The replacement of Greek kingdoms by the Roman empire as the administrator of the eastern Mediterranean basin led to the strengthening of direct maritime trade with the east and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of various land based trading routes.Lach 1994: 13 Strabo's mention of the vast increase in trade following the Roman annexation of Egypt indicates that monsoon was known from his time.Young 2001: 20 The trade started by Eudoxus of Cyzicus in 130 BCE kept increasing according to Strabo (II.5.12.): By the time of Augustus up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India. So much gold was used for this trade, and apparently recycled by the Kushan Empire (Kushans) for their own coinage, that Pliny the Elder (NH VI.101) complained about the drain of specie to India:\\"minimaque computatione miliens centena milia sestertium annis omnibus India et Seres et paeninsula illa imperio nostro adimunt: tanti nobis deliciae et feminae constant. quota enim portio ex illis ad deos, quaeso, iam vel ad inferos pertinet?\\" Pliny, Historia Naturae 12.41.84.

Trade of exotic animals Sri Lankan imitations of 4th-century Roman coins, 4th‚Äì8th century CE. There is evidence of animal trade between Indian Ocean harbours and the Mediterranean. This can be seen in the mosaics and frescoes of the remains of Roman villas in Italy. For example, the Villa del Casale has mosaics depicting the capture of animals in India, Indonesia and Africa. The intercontinental trade of animals was one of the sources of wealth for the owners of the villa. In the Ambulacro della Grande Caccia, the hunting and capture of animals is represented in such detail that it is possible to identify the species. There is a scene that shows a technique to distract a tiger with a shimmering ball of glass or mirror in order to take her cubs. Tiger hunting with red ribbons serving as a distraction is also shown. In the mosaic there are also numerous other animals such as rhinoceros, an Indian elephant (recognized from the ears) with his Indian conductor, and the Indian peafowl, and other exotic birds. There are also numerous animals from Africa. Tigers, leopards and Asian and African lions were used in the arenas and circuses. The European lion was already extinct at that time. Probably the last lived in the Balkan Peninsula and were hunted to stock arenas. The birds and monkeys entertained the guests of many villas. Also in the Villa Romana del Tellaro there is a mosaic with a tiger in the jungle attacking a man with Roman clothes, probably a careless hunter. The animals were transported in cages by ship. Ports =Roman ports= The three main Roman ports involved with eastern trade were Arsinoe, Berenice and Myos Hormos. Arsinoe was one of the early trading centers but was soon overshadowed by the more easily accessible Myos Hormos and Berenice. Arsinoe Sites of Egyptian Red Sea ports, including Alexandria and Berenice. The Ptolemaic dynasty exploited the strategic position of Alexandria to secure trade with the subcontinent.Lindsay 2006: 101 The course of trade with the east then seems to have been first through the harbor of Arsinoe, the present day Suez. The goods from the East African trade were landed at one of the three main Roman ports, Arsinoe, Berenice or Myos Hormos.O'Leary 2001: 72 The Romans repaired and cleared out the silted up canal from the Nile to harbor center of Arsinoe on the Red Sea.Fayle 2006: 52 This was one of the many efforts the Roman administration had to undertake to divert as much of the trade to the maritime routes as possible. Arsinoe was eventually overshadowed by the rising prominence of Myos Hormos. The navigation to the northern ports, such as Arsinoe-Clysma, became difficult in comparison to Myos Hormos due to the northern winds in the Gulf of Suez.Freeman 2003: 72 Venturing to these northern ports presented additional difficulties such as shoals, reefs and treacherous currents. Myos Hormos and Berenice Myos Hormos and Berenice appear to have been important ancient trading ports, possibly used by the Pharaonic traders of ancient Egypt and the Ptolemaic dynasty before falling into Roman control. The site of Berenice, since its discovery by Belzoni (1818), has been equated with the ruins near Ras Banas in Southern Egypt. However, the precise location of Myos Hormos is disputed with the latitude and longitude given in Ptolemy's Geography favoring Abu Sha'ar and the accounts given in classical literature and satellite images indicating a probable identification with Quseir el- Quadim at the end of a fortified road from Koptos on the Nile. The Quseir el- Quadim site has further been associated with Myos Hormos following the excavations at el-Zerqa, halfway along the route, which have revealed ostraca leading to the conclusion that the port at the end of this road may have been Myos Hormos. =Major regional ports= Roman piece of pottery from Arezzo, Latium, found at Virampatnam, Arikamedu (1st century CE).

The regional ports of Barbaricum (modern Karachi), Sounagoura (central Bangladesh), Barygaza (Bharuch in Gujarat), Muziris (present day Kodungallur), Korkai, Kaveripattinam and Arikamedu (Tamil Nadu) on the southern tip of present-day India were the main centers of this trade, along with Kodumanal, an inland city. The Periplus Maris Erythraei describes Greco-Roman merchants selling in Barbaricum \\"thin clothing, figured linens, topaz, coral, storax, frankincense, vessels of glass, silver and gold plate, and a little wine\\" in exchange for \\"costus, bdellium, lycium, nard, turquoise, lapis lazuli, Seric skins, cotton cloth, silk yarn, and indigo\\". In Barygaza, they would buy wheat, rice, sesame oil, cotton and cloth. Barigaza Trade with Barigaza, under the control of the Indo-Scythian Western Satrap Nahapana (\\"Nambanus\\"), was especially flourishing: Muziris Muziris, as shown in the Tabula Peutingeriana, with a \\"Templum Augusti\\" Muziris is a lost port city on the south-western coast of India which was a major center of trade in the ancient Tamil land between the Chera kingdom and the Roman Empire. Its location is generally identified with modern-day Cranganore (central Kerala).George Menachery (1987) Kodungallur City of St. Thomas; (2000) Azhikode alias Kodungallur Cradle of Christianity in India Large hoards of coins and innumerable shards of amphorae found at the town of Pattanam (near Cranganore) have elicited recent archeological interest in finding a probable location of this port city. According to the Periplus, numerous Greek seamen managed an intense trade with Muziris: Arikamedu The Periplus Maris Erythraei mentions a marketplace named Poduke (ch. 60), which G.W.B. Huntingford identified as possibly being Arikamedu in Tamil Nadu, a centre of early Chola trade (now part of Ariyankuppam), about from the modern Pondicherry.Huntingford 1980: 119. Huntingford further notes that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937, and archeological excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was \\"a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century AD\\". Cultural exchanges A 1st century CE Indian imitation of a coin of Augustus, British Museum. Bronze imitation of a Roman coin, Sri Lanka, 4th‚Äì8th century CE The Rome-subcontinental trade also saw several cultural exchanges which had a lasting effect on both the civilizations and others involved in the trade. The Ethiopian kingdom of Aksum was involved in the Indian Ocean trade network and was influenced by Roman culture and Indian architecture. Traces of Indian influences are visible in Roman works of silver and ivory, or in Egyptian cotton and silk fabrics used for sale in Europe.Lach 1994: 18 The Indian presence in Alexandria may have influenced the culture but little is known about the manner of this influence. Clement of Alexandria mentions the Buddha in his writings and other Indian religions find mentions in other texts of the period. Indian art also found its way into Italy: in 1938 the Pompeii Lakshmi was found in the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE). Han China was perhaps also involved in the Roman trade, with Roman embassies recorded for the years 166, 226, and 284 that allegedly landed in Rinan (Jianzhi) in northern Vietnam, according to Chinese histories.Ball 2016: 152‚Äì53Hill 2009: 27Yule 1915: 53‚Äì54 Roman coins and goods such as glasswares and silverwares have been found in China,An 2002: 83Harper 2002: 99‚Äì100, 106‚Äì07 as well as Roman coins, bracelets, glass beads, a bronze lamp, and Antonine-period medallions in Vietnam, especially at Oc Eo (belonging to the Funan Kingdom).O'Reilly 2007: 97 The 1st-century Periplus notes how a country called This, with a great city called Thinae (comparable to Sinae in Ptolemy's Geography), produced silk and exported it to Bactria before it traveled overland to Barygaza in India and down the Ganges River.Schoff 2004 [1912]: paragraph #64. Retrieved 24 September 2016. While Marinus of Tyre and Ptolemy provided vague accounts of the Gulf of Thailand and Southeast Asia,Su√°rez (1999): 90‚Äì92 the Alexandrian Greek monk and former merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes, in his Christian Topography (c. 550), spoke clearly about China, how to sail there, and how it was involved in the clove trade stretching to Ceylon.Yule 1915: 25‚Äì28Lieu 2009: 227 Comparing the small amount of Roman coins found in China as opposed to India, Warwick Ball asserts that most of the Chinese silk purchased by the Romans was done so in India, with the land route through ancient Persia playing a secondary role.Ball 2016: 153‚Äì54. Christian and Jewish settlers from Rome continued to live in India long after the decline in bilateral trade. Large hoards of Roman coins have been found throughout India, and especially in the busy maritime trading centers of the south. The Tamilakkam kings reissued Roman coinage in their own name after defacing the coins in order to signify their sovereignty.Kulke 2004: 108 Mentions of the traders are recorded in the Tamil Sangam literature of India. One such mention reads: \\"The beautifully built ships of the Yavanas came with gold and returned with pepper, and Muziris resounded with the noise.\\" (from poem no. 149 of 'Akananuru' of Sangam Literature)\\" Decline and aftermath =Roman decline= Coin of Byzantine Theodosius II, found in the excavation of a monastery in Ajanta Caves, India. Trade declined from the mid-3rd century during a crisis in the Roman Empire, but recovered in the 4th century until the early 7th century, when Khosrow II, Shah of the Sasanian Empire, occupied the Roman parts of the Fertile Crescent and Egypt until being defeated by the Eastern Roman emperor HeracliusFarrokh 2007: 252 at the end of 627, after which the lost territories were returned to the Eastern Romans. Cosmas Indicopleustes ('Cosmas who sailed to India') was a Greek-Egyptian trader, and later monk, who wrote about his trade trips to India and Sri Lanka in the 6th century. =Ravaging of the Gupta Empire by the Huns= In India, the Alchon Huns' invasions (496‚Äì534 CE) are said to have seriously damaged India's trade with Europe and Central Asia.The First Spring: The Golden Age of India by Abraham Eraly pp. 48 sq The Gupta Empire had been benefiting greatly from Indo-Roman trade. They had been exporting numerous luxury products such as silk, leather goods, fur, iron products, ivory, pearl or pepper from centers such as Nashik, Prathisthana, Pataliputra and Varanasi. The Huna invasions probably disrupted these trade relations and the tax revenues that came with it.Longman History & Civics ICSE 9 by Singh p. 81 Soon after the invasions, the Gupta Empire, already weakened by these invasions and the rise of local rulers, ended as well.Ancient Indian History and Civilization by Sailendra Nath Sen p. 221 Following the invasions, northern India was left in disarray, with numerous smaller Indian powers emerging after the crumbling of the Guptas.A Comprehensive History Of Ancient India p. 174 =Arab expansion= Egypt under the rule of the Rashidun and Ummayad Caliphates, drawn on the modern state borders. The Arabs, led by 'Amr ibn al-'As, crossed into Egypt in late 639 or early 640 CE.Meri 2006: 224 This advance marked the beginning of the Islamic conquest of Egypt. The capture of Alexandria and the rest of the country, brought an end to 670 years of Roman trade with the subcontinent. Tamil speaking south India turned to Southeast Asia for international trade where Indian culture influenced the native culture to a greater degree than the sketchy impressions made on Rome seen in the adoption of Hinduism and then Buddhism Kulke 2004: 106 However, knowledge of the Indian subcontinent and its trade was preserved in Byzantine books and it is likely that the court of the emperor still maintained some form of diplomatic relation to the region up until at least the time of Constantine VII, seeking an ally against the rising influence of the Islamic states in the Middle East and Persia, appearing in a work on ceremonies called De Ceremoniis.Luttwak 2009: 167‚Äì68 The Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople in the 15th century (1453), marking the beginning of Turkish control over the most direct trade routes between Europe and Asia.The Encyclopedia Americana 1989: 176 The Ottomans initially cut off eastern trade with Europe, leading in turn to the attempt by Europeans to find a sea route around Africa, spurring the European Age of Discovery, and the eventual rise of European Mercantilism and Colonialism.

Themes and style  Parekowhai makes a variety of work across a range of media that intersects sculpture and photography. Sally Blundell, writing in the New Zealand Listener, says: :Originality, authenticity, ownership. In Parekowhai‚Äôs work, such notions blur, slipping into a collective act of translation that interweaves the canon of \\"high art\\" with cultural tradition, the handmade object with mass-produced tourist tat, the imported with the proudly colloquial. Despite the range of Parekowhai's output, his practice is linked throughout, both stylistically‚Äîa characteristic 'gloss' of high production value‚Äîand thematically.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Kerry from 1831 to 1837, as a Whig, later termed Liberal. History of Parliament article by Stephen Farrell. Mullins was the son of the Hon. Frederick Ferriter Mullins, a Church of Ireland clergyman who was Rector of Killiney, County Kerry, and the son of Thomas Mullins, 1st Baron Ventry. Frederick William was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and trained as a barrister. Besides radical politics, he was also an interested follower of science. Parliament Mullins was a follower of Daniel O'Connell, who became his mentor and co-member for the County Kerry seat when Mullins was returned unopposed at a by-election in 1831. He was returned again in the General Election of 1832, but lost his seat in 1837 when voters criticized his increasing absenteeism from the constituency. After Parliament In 1839 he was prosecuted at the Bail Court over offences relating to a bill of exchange. In 1841, at the insistence of his cousin the 3rd Baron Ventry, he assumed the surname De Moleyns in lieu of his patronymic. The same year he obtained a patent \\"for the production of electricity and its application for illumination and motion\\". In 1854, he was prosecuted at the City of London Police Court for forging a signature to a power of attorney with intent to defraud the Bank of England of ¬£1,500. He protested his innocence but lacking funds to defend himself he was committed to Newgate Prison where he died suddenly, a week later, at the age of 49. His personal estate, then worth ¬£750, was insufficient when his will was finally probated in 1891. His heir, a nephew, refused to inherit because he did not want to accept the conditions of changing his own surname to De Moleyns and living for one in every four years in County Kerry. Under the will the money passed to University College, London for purpose of endowing a professorship in electrical science. The funds were insufficient so instead a trust fund, called the De Moleyns Fund, was set up in his memory by the University for the purpose of purchasing electrical equipment.

The album was unusual in that Gallagher used more additional musicians and spent more time recording than he normally did. Not as unusual, the songs show his love for blues artists such as Robert Johnson and Son House and for other genres such as Zydeco as well. The album explores themes of ill health, mortality, and fighting back against overwhelming odds. It shows the toll that Gallagher's health problems were starting to take on him. Background After the release of the album, Gallagher gave several interviews where he went into some detail about the songs and his way of making music. He emphasized how he modeled his music after folk and blues legends such as Muddy Waters. \\"So this folk music tradition of passing on, picking up, and stealing goes on like mad! If I'm doing a blues number I can do it very traditional if I want to; I can also add my own twists to it.\\" Gallagher said that the song \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is about a man \\"haunted in a room in a terrible condition. It's a semi-redemption type of song and it's also slightly preaching to people that you can't bribe St. Peter.\\" His inspiration for the song is the blues song \\"Hellhound On My Trail\\" by Robert Johnson. \\"The Loop\\" is a jazz instrumental. The song title refers to the Chicago loop the center of downtown Chicago that is demarcated by the CTA elevated train tracks that make a loop around it. The sound of a train pulling up to a stop is heard at the beginning of the song. \\"Walking Wounded\\" is a song about a man who is down but still fighting. Gallagher said it was partly inspired by his health problems. \\"Kid Gloves\\" is about a prize fighter pressured by the mob to throw a fight who refuses to give in. It is one of many Gallagher songs inspired by hardboiled fiction and film noir. The music for \\"Middle Name\\" is inspired by blues legend Slim Harpo. For the story Gallagher \\"tried to create an image of being down around the bible belt with a guy stuck in a situation searching for someone that could be his wife or someone else before a big storm or Armageddon or the Holocaust.\\" ‚ÄúKing of Zydeco\\" is inspired by the music of Clifton Chenier whom Gallagher called the \\"B.B. King of Zydeco\\". Chenier died before Gallagher was able to meet him, even though they played at least one music festival together and the regret over that lost opportunity inspired the song. Recording Gallagher's studio albums were often recorded rapidly, in as little as two weeks. This was partly due to time limitations caused by his heavy touring schedule but also due to the fact that Gallagher was always more comfortable in front of a live audience than in the studio. However, Gallagher spent six months recording Fresh Evidence. He described the recording of the album as follows: > \\"It took enough out of us, I can tell you. It took about six months to make, > which is quite a long time really. It sounds like relatively simple music, > but we were trying to get a good vintage, ethnic sound in the production and > everything else.

Today, as a result of the diversification of Seoul's transportation network, it has become a great transportation hub for Asia. Airports Incheon International Airport. Main Articles: Incheon International Airport and Gimpo Airport There are two airports that serve Seoul. Gimpo International Airport, formerly in Gimpo but annexed to Seoul in 1963, was the only airport for Seoul from its original construction during the Korean War. Multiple airports were built in and around Seoul immediately before, during, and after the war. The most famous was on Yeouido, which once served as the country's gateway to the world. Upon opening in March 2001, Incheon International Airport on Yeongjong island in Incheon changed the role of Gimpo Airport significantly. Incheon is now responsible for almost all international flights. Following the opening of Incheon, Gimpo started only serving domestic flights, but has since started opening limited routes to major East Asian cities, such as Tokyo (Haneda Airport), Osaka (Kansai International Airport), Beijing (Beijing-Capital Airport), Shanghai (Shanghai‚ÄìHongqiao Airport), Taipei (Taipei‚ÄìSongshan Airport). Meanwhile, Incheon International Airport has become, along with Hong Kong and Singapore, a major transportation centre for East Asia. Following its opening in 2001, the airport opened a 3rd runway as well as a concourse extension in 2008, as well as Terminal 2 in 2018, with additional expansions currently under construction. Incheon International Airport has also frequently been voted amongst the best airports in the world, by Skytrax and Airports Council Internationalhttps://www.worldairportawards.com/worlds- top-10-airports-2020/#:~:text=Seoul%20Incheon-,Seoul%20Incheon,Best%20Transit%20Airport%20in%202020. Incheon and Gimpo are linked to Seoul and the rest of the country by highways, as well as urban rail service. The Incheon International Airport Railroad (or AREX, and styled as A'REX) station is located in the Transport Centre adjacent to the main terminal building provides urban rail services to Gimpo Airport and Seoul. In addition, the Incheon Airport Maglev also operates from the airport. As for Gimpo Airport, besides the AREX line, it is also connected to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway, as Gimpo Airport Station offers services on Line 5, Line 9 and the Gimpo Goldline. Bus Branch bus There are four types of buses: Seoul has many big intercity/express bus terminals. These buses connect Seoul to cities all around Korea. Major bus terminals include *Seoul Express Bus Terminal in Seocho-gu *Central City in Seocho-gu *Seoul Nambu Terminal, also in Seocho-gu *Dongseoul Bus Terminal in Gwangjin-gu *Sangbong Terminal in Jungnang-gu Subway Subway in Seoul. Seoul has 22 subway lines that interlink every district of the city with one another and with the surrounding area. The majority of the population now uses the public transportation system due to its convenience and low cost. With more than 8 million passengers a day, Seoul has one of the busiest subway systems in the world. Taxi Taxi in Seoul. There are two tiers of taxis - Regular (ÏùºÎ∞ò ÌÉùÏãú, Ilban taxi), and Deluxe (Î™®Î≤î ÌÉùÏãú, Mobeom taxi). Regular taxis start at 3800 won for the first two kilometers and are metered at 100 won every 132 meters, which equates to about 758 won per kilometer. If the taxi is going less than 15 km per hour, an additional charge of 100 KRW per 31 seconds is added to the fare. A 20% surcharge is added between midnight and 4 am. These are typically white or silver in color but also can be seen in yellow Deluxe taxis start at 6500 won for the first three kilometers and are metered at 200 won every 151 meters, which equates to about 1325 won per kilometer. If the taxi is going less than 15 km per hour, an additional charge of 200 KRW per 36 seconds is added to the fare. Their name could also be translated as \\"Model Taxi\\" as their service should be an example of what a proper taxi is. Deluxe taxis do not have nightly surcharges.

Its common names include common potato rustPuccinia pittieriana. Invasive Species Compendium. CABI. and common potato and tomato rust.Puccinia pittieriana. Invasive and Emerging Fungal Pathogens - Diagnostic Fact Sheets. USDA ARS. This fungus was first made known to science in 1904 when it was collected from potatoes in cultivation on the slopes of Iraz√∫ Volcano in Costa Rica. It was later found on wild potato species such as Solanum demissum and on tomato crops. It is now known from Central and South America and from Mexico. Its known hosts now include many wild and cultivated species of Solanum. This is the only rust fungus that infects tomatoes. Fungal infection manifests as greenish white spots a few millimeters wide on the undersides of a plant's leaves. The upper surfaces of the leaves may be dimpled as the lesions penetrate the blades. The lesions turn whitish with red to brown centers. The lesions spread across the leaf, which then dies and falls. Lesions can also form on the petioles, stems, flowers, and fruits. The fungal spores are borne on the wind and infect plants when the plant surface is moist and the average temperature is around 10 ¬∞C. Symptoms appear in about two weeks and the lesions are largest by 20 to 25 days after infection by spores. Several potato cultivars are resistant to the rust.

It is Debussy's only string quartet. Background That year Debussy had abandoned the opera Rodrigue et Chim√®ne. He planned to write two string quartets, only one of which materialized. The string quartet was to be dedicated to composer Ernest Chausson, whose personal reservations eventually diverted the composer's original intentions. The quartet received its premiere on December 29, 1893 by the Ysa√øe Quartet at the Soci√©t√© Nationale in Paris to mixed reactions. Analysis The work is in four movements: Its sensuality and impressionistic tonal shifts are emblematic of its time and place while, with its cyclic structure, it constitutes a final divorce from the rules of classical harmony and points the way ahead. After its premiere, composer Guy Ropartz described the quartet as \\"dominated by the influence of young Russia (Debussy's patroness in the early 1880s had been Nadezhda von Meck, better known for her support of Tchaikovsky); there are poetic themes, rare sonorities, the first two movements being particularly remarkable.\\" Debussy wrote that \\"[a]ny sounds in any combination and in any succession are henceforth free to be used in a musical continuity.\\" Pierre Boulez said that Debussy freed chamber music from \\"rigid structure, frozen rhetoric and rigid aesthetics.\\" Maurice Ravel, an Impressionist composer associated with Debussy, also wrote a single string quartet, a piece that is modeled on Debussy's.

It was established in 1946, became part of the United States of Indonesia in 1949 at the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, and was dissolved in 1950 with the end of the USI. It comprised all the islands to the east of Borneo (Celebes, and the Moluccas, with their offshore islands) and of Java (Bali and the Lesser Sunda Islands). History The Dutch authorities, after various changes to the administration of the eastern islands of the East Indies, established the Great East region in 1938. Four years later, the Japanese invaded, and this area was placed under the control of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Following the Japanese surrender and the Indonesian declaration of independence in August 1945, Indonesian republicans began fighting to secure Indonesian independence from Dutch colonial control. However, Dutch administrators backed by Australian troops arrived in the area previously controlled by the Japanese Navy, and prevented republicans from establishing an administration. From 16‚Äì25 July 1946, the Dutch organised a conference in the town of Malino on Celebes (Sulawesi) as part of their attempt to arrange a federal solution for Indonesia. The Malino Conference resulted in plans for a state in Borneo and another for East Indonesia (then called the \\"Great East\\"), areas where the Dutch held both de facto and de jure control. Later that year, Republic of Indonesia agreed to the principle of a federal Indonesia with the Linggadjati Agreement of 15 November. The Denpasar Conference of 18‚Äì24 December was held to work out the specifics of a state to be called the State of the Great East. (). That state was established on 24 December and, on 27 December, renamed the State of East Indonesia (Negara Indonesia Timoer or NIT which some opponents joked stood for negara ikoet toean or \\"state which goes along with the master\\", i.e. the Dutch). With the realisation of the United States of Indonesia on 27 December 1949, East Indonesia became a constituent of the new federation. In much of Indonesia, the federal USI was seen as an illegitimate regime foisted on the islands by the Dutch, and many of the federal states began to merge with the Republic of Indonesia. However many in East Indonesia, with its non-Javanese population and greater number of Christians, opposed moves toward a unitary state. East Indonesia had already dealt with the \\"Twelfth Province\\" secessionist movement in Minahasa in 1948. The formation of East Indonesia's last cabinet in May 1950 with the intention of dissolving the state into the Republic of Indonesia led to open rebellion in the largely Christian Moluccas and the proclamation of an independent Republic of the South Moluccas (RMS). The USI was dissolved on 17 August 1950 and the rebellion in the Moluccas was crushed in November of the same year. Government The Denpasar Conference of 18‚Äì24 December 1946 approved the Regulations for the Formation of the State of East Indonesia (Peratoeran Pembentoekan Negara Indonesia Timoer) which supplemented the 1927 Dutch colonial law and established the provisional governmental framework of the new state until a constitution could be approved. Although the draft constitution was passed by the legislative on 1 March 1949, it was never adopted and the 1946 regulations remained n place until the state was dissolved. The state was to have an executive president who would appoint a cabinet and a legislature. A number of powers were explicitly reserved for the future United States of Indonesia, of which East Indonesia would be a constituent member. =President= President Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati of the State of East Indonesia and his wife, Gilberte Vincent, during a visit to North Celebes in 1948 Balinese nobleman Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati was elected president (presiden) at the Denpasar Conference that established the state, and held that position for the duration of the state's existence (24 December 1946 ‚Äì 17 August 1950). =Legislature= The Provisional Representative Body for the State of East Indonesia (Dewan Perwakilan Sementara Negara Indonesia Timoer), initially consisting of the 70 participants of the Denpasar Conference, opened its first session on 22 April 1947 in the presence of Lieutenant Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Hubertus van Mook. In May 1949, following elections, a Provisional Senate was established =Prime ministers and cabinets= The Construction Cabinet of East Indonesia, which was installed at 4 o'clock in the afternoon in the former building of the Council of Indies in Batavia. The state had a parliamentary cabinet appointed by the president but much real power remained with the Dutch East Indies authorities. *13 Jan 1947 ‚Äì 2 Jun 1947 ‚Äî Nadjamoedin Daeng Malewa ‚Äì First Cabinet *2 Jun 1947 ‚Äì 11 Oct 1947 ‚Äî Nadjamoedin Daeng Malewa ‚Äì Second Cabinet *11 Oct 1947 ‚Äì 15 Dec 1947 ‚Äî Warouw Cabinet *15 Dec 1947 ‚Äì 12 Jan 1949 ‚Äî Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung ‚Äì First Cabinet *12 Jan 1949 ‚Äì 27 Dec 1949 ‚Äî Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung ‚Äì Second Cabinet *27 Dec 1949 ‚Äì 14 Mar 1950 ‚Äî J.E.

Poetoehena Cabinet Administration The State of East Indonesia was divided into five residencies which were in turn divided into districts (afdeling) and subdistricts (onderafdeling), an administrative structure inherited from the Dutch. Within the residencies were 13 autonomous regions. These regions, listed in Article 14 of the Regulations for the Formation of the State of East Indonesia (Peratoeran Pembentoekan Negara Indonesia Timoer), were South Celebes, Minahasa, Sangihe and Talaoed, North Celebes, Central Celebes, Bali, Lombok, Soembawa, Flores, Soemba, Timor and surrounding islands, South Moluccas, and North Moluccas. The residencies were to be eliminated after the construction of functioning administration in the 13 regions. Complicating this structure was the fact that > More than 75% of the State of East Indonesia comprised autonomous regions, > in total 115 autonomous regional governments under the rule of rajas > (swaprajas). The position of these autonomous governmental heads was > regulated by what were called korte verklaring (short-term declarations) and > lange kontrakten (long-term contracts); these were actually intended as a > recognition by the Dutch Indies Government of the special position of the > rajas, whose power to govern the autonomous regions was handed down from one > generation to the next. The Autonomous Region Regulation of 1938 gave the swaprajas wide de jure autonomy but most of the rajas were puppets of Dutch administrators.The State of East Indonesia sought to curtail the power of these raja-ruled regions, but the Regulations for the Formation of the State of East Indonesia obliged the state to recognise their special status. The remaining area of the state not part of the swaprajas comprised directly governed regions (rechtstreeks bestuurd gebied). Directly governed areas included Minahasa, the South Moluccas, Gorontalo, the districts of Macassar and Bonthain, and Lombok. =Residencies and autonomous regions= The regions of the State of East Indonesia The following were the residencies and their autonomous regions. *North Celebes (Soelawesi Oetara) **Sangihe and Talaoed **Minahasa **North Celebes **Central Celebes (Soelawesi Tengah) *South Sulawesi (Soelawesi Selatan) **South Celebes *Bali-Lombok **Bali **Lombok *Moluccas (Maloekoe) **North Moluccas (Maloekoe Oetara) **South Moluccas (Maloekoe Selatan) *Timor **Flores **Soemba **Soembawa **Timor and surrounding islands See also *History of Indonesia *Indonesian National Revolution *Indonesian regions Notes References  * *Putra Agung. \\"Yayasan Masyarakat Sejarawan Indonesia\\".

It lasted until 17 June 1944 when a national referendum established the Republic of Iceland in its place. Under a personal union, due to the Act of Union, the monarch was simultaneously monarch of Denmark. The Parliament of Iceland asked that Denmark represent Iceland internationally, and day-to-day matters were delegated to a Danish plenipotentiary for Icelandic affairs based in Reykjav√≠k, and ‚Äì after the German invasion of Denmark in 1940 ‚Äì a regent was appointed. Origins of Danish rule Because of the Kalmar Union, Iceland had been under the control of the Crown of Denmark since 1380, although formally it had been a Norwegian possession until 1814. In 1874, one thousand years after the first acknowledged settlement, Denmark granted Iceland home rule. The constitution, written the same year, was revised in 1903 and the extent of Iceland's home rule increased in 1904. A minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjav√≠k, was made responsible to the Althing, the Icelandic parliament. Establishment of the kingdom On 1 December 1918, the Act of Union, an agreement with Denmark, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state, an independent country in personal union with Denmark through a common monarch. The Kingdom of Iceland established its own flag and coat of arms and asked that Denmark represent its foreign affairs and defence interests on its behalf while retaining full control over its foreign affairs and defence. Iceland opened its first Embassy in 1920. The Act would be reviewed in 1940 and could be revoked three years later if agreement to continue it could not be reached. World War II, British occupation and the establishment of the republic The German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940 severed communications between Iceland and Denmark. As a result, on 10 April, the Althing passed two resolutions investing the Icelandic cabinet with the power of head of state and declaring that Iceland would accept full responsibility for both foreign policy and coastal surveillance. A year later, on 15 May 1941 the Althing adopted a law creating the position of regent for Sveinn Bj√∂rnsson in order to represent the monarchy. During the first year of World War II, Iceland strictly enforced a position of neutrality and took action against both British and German forces that violated it. On 10 May 1940, Operation Fork was launched by the United Kingdom when military forces sailed into Reykjav√≠k harbour and began an invasion of Iceland. The government of Iceland issued a protest against what it called a \\"flagrant violation\\" of Icelandic neutrality. On the day of the invasion, Prime Minister Hermann J√≥nasson read a radio announcement instructing Icelanders to treat the British troops as guests. The Allied occupation of Iceland lasted until 1941 when the Government of Iceland asked the United States to take over its defence. The defence of Iceland was the United States' first participation in World War II. At its peak, Britain had approximately 25,000 troops stationed in Iceland, all but eliminating unemployment in Reykjav√≠k and other strategically important places. In July 1941, the Althingi adopted the American‚ÄìIcelandic defence agreement, passing responsibility for Iceland's defence to the United States. As many as 40,000 American soldiers were then stationed on the island, outnumbering the native population of adult men. (Iceland's total native population during the war was approximately 120,000.) Following a constitutional referendum in May 1944, Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944. Many Danes felt offended at its timing, as Denmark was still occupied by Germany. The king in Copenhagen, Christian X, nonetheless sent a message of congratulations to the Icelandic people.

French, CIP, Lima, Bugwood.org Septoria leaf spot, necrotic areas susceptible to leaf dropDr Parthasarathy Seethapathy, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Bugwood.org Septoria malagutii is a fungal plant pathogen infecting potatoes. The casual fungal pathogen is a deuteromycete and therefore has no true sexual stage. As a result, Septoria produces pycnidia, an asexual flask shaped fruiting body, on the leaves of potato and other tuber-bearing spp. causing small black to brown necrotic lesions ranging in size from 1-5mm. The necrotic lesions can fuse together forming large necrotic areas susceptible to leaf drop, early senescence, dieback, and dwarfing. Septoria malagutii has been found only in the Andean countries of Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela at altitudes of near 3000 meters. Consequently, the fungi grows and disperses best under relatively low temperatures with high humidities, with optimal growth occurring at 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F). The disease has caused devastation on potato yields in South America and in areas where this disease is common, potato yields have been seen to drop by 60%.  Hosts and symptoms  Hosts of Septoria malagutii include: potatoes and other tuber-bearing Solanum spp.; however, tomatoes can be infected by artificial inoculation. The disease is found in a series of ‚Äòtuberosa‚Äô in the Andes mountains of Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela at elevations reaching above 3000m.Septoria malagutii is a deuteromycete; therefore, the fungi does not have a true sexual stage or the sexual stage is extremely uncommon. Consequently, the fungi reproduces asexually via its conidiomata, pycnidia. The pycnidia are an asexual flask shaped fruiting body that produces conidia via mitosis. Above ground parts of the potato become infected by the conidia (pycnidiospores) in a variety of natural ways such as rainy or windy conditions. Signs and symptoms of the disease are easily observable on the upper side of infected leaves where small, dark brown, and round necrotic lesions ranging in size from 1-5mm are formed. The lesions exhibit pronounced concentric ridges with 1 to 3 erumpent black pycnidia within the central ring. Other symptoms on the leaves include: the lesions often fusing together to create large necrotic areas, making the leaves brittle and susceptible to leaf drop or wind damage. Additionally, the stems can become discolored and resemble bark and the whole plant can exhibit dwarfing, early senescence, and dieback. Stem lesions are more elongated than leaf lesions reaching up to 15mm in length and 2mm in diameter. Furthermore, there has been no report on the underground plant parts, such as roots and tubers, having been affected by the pathogen. Potato is known to be the only naturally cultivated host and infection is limited to the leaves of potato plants under natural circumstances; and, fertile formation of pycnidia on living leaves has not been observed. Lastly, the prevalence of resistance in varying cultivars is low, ranging from moderately resistant to very resistant, but it is uncertain how long the pathogen can survive in the infected host debris in soil.  Environment  Septoria malagutii is specific to the Andean countries of south South America: Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. In Ecuador, it is reported to occur mostly at temperatures of around 8 ¬∞C with a high relative humidity. The pathogen has a growth preference for lower temperatures explaining why it is found only in the high altitudes of the Andes mountain range. The minimum temperature for mycelial growth is 3 ¬∞C, while optimal growth occurs at 20-21 ¬∞C, and a maximum of 27 ¬∞C. A moist period with wet leaves of up to 2 days are required for the pathogen to infect plants at 16 to 22 ¬∞C. Moreover, the disease has been reported in cold and humid conditions in the Andes at altitudes above 2000m. These conditions make it the spread of the fungi favorable splashing to neighboring plants via rainwater, and insect vectors such as beetles.  Management  Management of Septoria leaf spot of potato is important because once introduced into a new area due to its soil borne and long lasting nature it is impossible to eradicate. Today, Septoria malagutii and other septoria disease are controlled with a number of different methods including the use of fungicides and cultural controls. Fungicides such as Fluazinam, used for controlling late blight of potato, Phytotophoria infestans, have proven to be effective against S. Malagutti. Although the systemic anti-oomycete compounds have failed, fungicides should still be used during early stages of infection in order to prevent secondary spread via lesions being a source of inoculum spread. Likewise, the fungicid fentin was proven to be effective in controlling Septoria. In addition, biological controls such as copper sulfate can be integrated with other fungicides to further control the spread of disease by preventing germination of the pycnidia. Culturally, in places where potatoes can be grown all year round a Septoria infection can be avoided by planting during seasons with low humidity or higher temperatures. This is beneficial in controlling the disease because Septoria malagutii‚Äôs mycelial growth is optimal in low temperatures and its spores disperse more efficiently under humid conditions. Likewise, since the pathogen can spread from inoculum sources such as plant debris on soil and wild hosts via clothing on farmers, footwear, tubers coated in soil, and cultivation equipment, so it is important to sterilize equipment between uses in order to limit its spread.  Importance  The severity of Septoria leaf spot of Potato in the Northwestern countries of South America is notable. The disease destroys up to 60% of potato yield in South America causing significant crop loss in Andean countries. Moreover, countries within the European Union and elsewhere around the world are susceptible to establishment of the disease. Potatoes are widely grown in the EU and Septoria malagutii would have host availability and thrive in the cool humid climate of European countries, so it is essential to keep the disease contained to the Andes.

Silver scurf is a blemish disease, meaning the effect it has on tubers is mostly cosmetic and affects ‚Äúfresh market, processing and seed tuber potatoes.\\" There are some reports of it affecting development, meaning growth and tuber yield.Mooi JC, 1968. The silver scurf disease of the potato. Mededeling van het Instituute voor Plantenzeiktenkundig Onderzoek 482, 1¬±62. This is caused by light brown lesions, which in turn change the permeability of tuber skin and then it causes tuber shrinkage and water loss, which finally causes weight loss. The disease has become economically important because silver scurf affected potatoes for processing and direct consumption have been rejected by the industry. The disease cycle can be divided into two stages: field and storage. It is mainly a seed borne disease and the primary source of inoculum is mainly infected potato seed tubers. Symptoms develop and worsen in storage because the conditions are conducive to sporulation. The ideal conditions for the spread of this disease are high temperatures and high humidity. There are also many cultural practices that favor spread and development. Luckily, there are multiple ways to help control the disease.  Signs and Symptoms  Silver scurf blemishes on a tuber Silver scurf is a plant disease of potato, which is caused by the anamorphic ascomycete fungus, Helminthosporium Solani. Potato tubers are the only known host of Helminthosporium solani. It is a highly specific pathogen which does not have a secondary host or alternate host. A common symptom of this disease is blemishing on the surface of the potato tubers. These blemishes are tan and/or gray due to a loss of pigment, and they are usually irregularly shaped. Also, a post-harvest symptom can be shrinkage and shriveling of the outer tissue of the potato due to water loss. Black spots can also be found on the surface of infected tubers, which are a sign of the disease. These are made up of conidia and conidiophores of the pathogenic fungus. The conidia are characterized by being very darkly melanized and having multiple pseudosepta. Another characteristic of this fungus is the absence of motile spores. Like with many other fungal plant diseases, a diagnosis can be made by looking for the specific sexual structures of the fungus and observing them for the specific characteristics of silver scurf. Another way that silver scurf can be diagnosed is through molecular techniques, such as PCR and sequencing to identify the presence of the pathogen. The primer pair, HSF19-HSR447, has been generated to be specific for amplifying only a section of Helminthosporium Solani DNA. Currently, no known host factors have been identified that have been linked to increase susceptibility or development of the disease. It seems as though the environmental conditions are what plays a major role in severity of the disease.  Disease Cycle  The disease cycle of silver scurf can be divided in two phases (field and storage). The primary source of inoculum is infected potato seed tubers. This inoculum is then transferred to the daughter tubers through an unknown mechanism, although indirect evidence suggests it happens when they come in direct contact or close proximity to daughter tubers. Conidia produced on the surface of seed tubers are dispersed by rain or irrigation to uninfected tubers. These conidia germinate and infect tubers. The pathogen enters through the periderm or lenticels. After that, the pathogen colonizes the periderm cells in the tuber. Infection may happen when tubers are formed and can continue in the season. In harvest (mostly in summer), silver scurf symptoms are not too apparent. However, the symptoms develop and worsen due relatively humid and warm temperatures in storage, since these conditions are conducive to sporulation. Secondary inoculum is produced by conidia, which can spread in storage by wind of ventilation while the tubers are in storage. When a seed tuber from this storage is planted, this can then carry inoculum to the field. It was believed that overwintering soil-borne inoculum wasn‚Äôt important in the disease cycle, but recent studies suggest H.solani may survive in the soil for a short period of time, which can cause more infection. This is an imperfect fungus and its teleomorph has not been described. Disease symptoms appear on tubers, but not on the haulm (vine) or roots, and are limited to the periderm, composed of phellem, phelloderm and cortical layers that replace the epidermis of the tuber.Fahn A, ed., 1982. Plant Anatomy. Exeter, UK: Wheaton. See next section (Environment) to understand the occurrence and severity of the different stages of the life cycle mentioned here.  Environment  There are a number of conditions that favor the spread and development of H. solani. Usually, the temperature range of 15 ~ 32 ¬∞C combined with high humidity increase conidial germination. In addition to this, there are many cultural practices which affect the conditions that favor disease spread and development. These practices include: the level of H.solani present on the seed, planting and harvesting dates, crop rotations and warehouse management. It has been demonstrated that later harvest dates increase the development of the disease. It has also been demonstrated that the disease was more severe when planting densities were higher. All of these factors combined have an effect of disease spread and development.  Pathogenesis  The spores can still infect and cause disease in daughter tubers in the soil for about two years. It is also possible for the pathogen to spread by growing through the roots of a potato plant to the developing tubers and cause infection. H. solani conidia are found on the outside of potato tubers, and the hyphae enter the tuber to cause disease. The pathogen can enter the tissue through wounds or natural openings, as well as being able to directly penetrate the periderm with the use of an appressorium and penetration peg. The fungus is contained in the outer layers of the potato and cannot infect very deep into the tuber. The discoloration on the periderm of the potato is formed from the loss of pigmentation caused by extreme dryness of the cell and suberin deposition. Not much is currently known about the molecular aspects of the mechanism for spread and infection of the disease, but there is currently ongoing research on this pathogen to gain a better understanding.  Disease Control  = Chemical Control = Fungicides control many plant diseases efficiently, but very limited types of fungicides are efficient against the silver scurf pathogen. Fungicides usually apply to soil or seed tubers before culturing.  Thiabendazole (TBZ) Fungicide  TBZ is widely used as post-harvest treatment on potatoes since the early 1970s. Silver scurf on tubers can be reduced by the systemic broad- spectrum fungicide TBZ. TBZ is low toxicity and is used to prevent or control silver scurf for short time period, e.g. several months, with no effect on quality or retention of residues.Hide GA, Hirst JM, Griffith RL, 1969a. Control of potato tuber diseases with systemic fungicides. In: Proceedings of the Fifth British Insecticide and Fungicide Conference, Brighton. Croydon, UK: British Crop Protection Council, 310-4.  TBZ-Resistant H. solani Isolates  The TBZ fungicide used to be very effective until 1977 when TBZ-resistant H. solani isolates were found in potato stores, as post-harvest treatment. TBZ resistance in H. solani resulted from a point mutation of a single base at codon 198 from glutamic acid to glutamine, or alanine, in the b-tubulin. This mutation functions in avoiding TBZ and other benzimidazole fungicides from binding to the H. solani b-tubulin gene thus results in TBZ-resistant phenotypes.  Fungicides Besides TBZ  As the frequency of resistant isolates to TBZ increase, some other fungicides have been tested to control silver scurf, such as imazalil, prochloraz and propiconazole fungicides, which are all classified in conazole, DMI (demethylation inhibitors). Imazalil and prochloraz fungicides are commonly used in seed treatment, while propiconazole fungicide is usually for foliar treatment. = Host resistance = One of the major reasons for the increasing economic importance of silver scurf is the lack of high levels of resistance in potato cultivars.M√âRIDA, C.L., LORIA, R., & HALSETH, D.E. (1994). Effects of potato cultivar and time of harvest on the severity of silver scurf. Plant Dis., 78, 146‚Äì149.RODRIGUEZ, D.A. (1994). Studies on epidemiology and management of silver scurf of potato. PhD Thesis. North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND. Interspecific crosses with wild Solanum sp. have been used to increase disease resistance in cultivars of S. tuberosum. Genes from the wild tuber-bearing species Solanum demissum, Solanum chacoense and Solanum aculae, which have low sporulation of H. solani, have been incorporated into the background of some Canadian potato cultivars.De Jong H, Tarn TR, 1984. Using germplasm in potato breeding in Canada. Canadian Agriculture 30, 12-4.Murphy AM, De Jong H, Proudfoot KG, 1999. A multiple disease resistant potato clone developed with classical breeding methodology. Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology 21, 207‚Äì12. These interspecific crosses and advanced selections are being screened for resistance to different diseases including silver scurf.Kurowski C, Manzer F, 1992. Re-evaluation of Solanum species accessions showing resistance to bacterial ring rot. American Potato Journal 69, 289-97. However, no silver scurf-resistant cultivars of Solanum tuberosum have, thus far, been identified. There is lack of reports of silver scurf resistant potato cultivars. = Suppressive soils = Soil types influenced the development of silver scurf to a great extent, both at harvest season and the following three-month storage period. Some soils displayed suppressiveness in different levels. The results from experimental trials revealed a significant negative correlation between silver scurf disease severity, and soil NO3 content and Fe availability. NO3 had been negatively correlated with silver scurf disease previously.ADAMS, A.P., SANDAR, N., & NELSON, D.C. (1970). Some properties of soils affecting russet scab and silver scurf of potatoes. Am. Potato J., 47, 49‚Äì57. This provides a possible suppressive effect of these two soil components. NO3 is an efficient nitrogen source used by H. solani.SINGH, A. (1968). Studies on Helminthosporium solani, the causal organism of silver scurf of potato. PhD Thesis, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND. Therefore, a direct adverse effect between silver scurf and NO3 is not likely to happen. A probable explanation for this observation is that NO3 could function on other soil microorganisms which possibly act as H. solani antagonists. These results indicated that microbial antagonists may be the key components contributing to soil suppressiveness and their antagonists may lead efficient biological control of silver scurf. = Biological control = Biological control is considered an attractive alternative to chemicals for the efficient, reliable, and environmentally safe control of plant pathogens. A fungus of the genus Cephalosporium Corda (now been renamed Acremonium strictum) was able to decrease the dissemination of silver scurf in storage. Cephalosporium has shown the ability to significantly diminish sporulation, spore germination and mycelial growth of H. solani. However, Cephalosporium does not reduce silver scurf on previously infected potatoes. In laboratory experiments, isolations from potato growing soil and the rhizosphere of potato plants during sprouting, Trichoderma hamatum Bainier, Trichoderma koningii Oudem., Trichoderma polysporum Rifai, Trichoderma harzianum Rifai and Trichoderma viride Pers. were the most inhibitory microorganisms to H. solani growth in vitro.Kurzawinska, Halina, 2006: An interaction of potato crop soil fungi population on fungi responsible for tuber superficial diseases. Journal of Plant Protection Research 46(4): 339-346 Achromobacter piechaudii, Bacillus cereus, Cellulomonadaceae fimi, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida and Streptomyces griseus were able to inhibit mycelial growth and/or conidial germination through the production of diffusible metabolites and that antibiosis was likely responsible fully or partially for their antagonism of H. solani.  Biopesticides  Serenade ASO (a formulation of Bacillus subtilis) has proved to suppress silver scurf, reduced both the incidence and severity of silver scurf under low disease pressure and delayed the beginning of silver scurf in storage for five months.  Relevance  When silver scurf was first found in Moscow in 1871, it was considered as a minor plant disease. After an increase in silver scurf incidence from America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, China, and New Zealand since 1968, the disease was later considered a pathogen of major importance. Although the disease did not cause potato yield losses and only affected the cosmetic appearance of the tuber, it had a huge impact on the potato market. With growing consumer demands for attractive appearance in fresh market cultivars, silver scurf on potatoes with blemishes and discoloration have been rejected by the industry. Furthermore, the silver scurf causes water loss which makes it difficult to peel the tubers. The excess tuber shrinkage also causes weight loss in tubers. From the cosmetic effect, dehydration, and weight loss of the tubers, the fresh market is facing major economic losses from the disease even today. For example, the Idaho's potato industry lost about 7 to 8.5 million dollars from the silver scurf disease. Not only does the cost come from rejecting silver scurf diseased potatoes, but it also comes from an increase in the amount of time needed for sorting and inspecting every potato.

Source material Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa's two short stories \\"Rashomon\\" (1915), also known as \\"The Rashomon Gate\\", and \\"In a Grove\\" (1922), also known as \\"The Cedar Grove\\", were famously fused and adapted as the basis for Akira Kurosawa's 1950 award-winning film Rashomon, screenplay by Kurosawa and frequent collaborator Shinobu Hashimoto. In 1951 the film won an honorary International Academy Award, following the success of the film in winning a Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival in the same year. The Kurosawa and Hashimoto screenplay deviates from Akutagawa's original stories in a number of ways, most notably by allowing a note of hope to triumph over Akutagawa's dark pessimism. Neither Akutagawa's story nor any of the plays based on it share anything with the popular traditional Rash≈çmon (Noh play) (c.1420) about a man who climbs the raj≈çmon gate to see if a demon is on top of it. Stage versions =Fay and Michael Kanin= This 1959 Broadway adaptation by Fay and Michael Kanin ran for six months (January‚ÄìJune) at the Music Box Theatre, New York, starring husband and wife Rod Steiger and Claire Bloom. The Kanins' production was nominated for three Tony awards. The Kanins' somewhat sentimental script sticks closely to the film, including elements added by Kurosawa that do not appear in Akutagawa's original short stories. The Kanins later went on to write the film screenplay for the Western The Outrage, which also credits Kurosawa and Akutagawa (but not Hashimoto). The Outrage was one of several Westerns based on Kurosawa's films, most notably John Sturges' The Magnificent Seven, adapted from Kurosawa's historical epic Seven Samurai (1954), and Sergio Leone's ground-breaking \\"Spaghetti Western\\" A Fistful of Dollars (1964). The Kanins' script was also staged on U.S. television as a \\"Play of the Week\\" (1960). East West Players (EWP) presented the first intimate staging of the Kanins' script, as their inaugural production in 1966. The show was revived two more times by EWP before retiring (once during their 5th season in 1970, and once in their 20th season in 1986). More modern adaptations of Rashomon have gone back to Akutagawa's original stories. =Ivor Benjamin= Ivor Benjamin's 1988 adaptation is from original translations by Jane Guaschi, then a language student at Sheffield University, U.K., and stays closer to the bleaker viewpoint of Akutagawa than the Kanins' version.

He was born in Georgia, grew up in Switzerland, and later lived in the United Kingdom and the United States. He owned the Crawdaddy Club in London where The Rolling Stones were the house band, and he was involved with their early management. He hired The Yardbirds as a replacement and managed them. He was also their producer from the beginning through 1966. In 1967, he started Marmalade Records (distributed by Polydor), which featured Brian Auger, Julie Driscoll and the Trinity, Blossom Toes, and early recordings by Graham Gouldman and Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, who became 10cc. The label closed in 1969. Gomelsky was also instrumental in the careers of Soft Machine, Daevid Allen and Gong, Magma and Material. Early years Gomelsky was born in Tiflis (modern day Tbilisi), Georgia. His father was a medical doctor, and his mother was from Monte Carlo. The family left in 1938 and via Syria, Egypt, and Italy, in 1944 settled in Switzerland, the country where his father had trained. Giorgio discovered jazz at the age of 10, while living in Italy. One Sunday he was caught out by the 4pm German curfew, so he stayed in the house of friends. Exploring their attic he discovered a gramophone and some jazz records. As a symbol of defiance he and his friends took to occasionally briefly blasting the music out of the window. Fortunately they were never caught. After the liberation, eventually black GIs arrived and furthered his jazz education. He attended a Benedictine school in Ascona, near Locarno, Switzerland. With the war over, he was able to pool resources with friends to start a record collection. By 1946, the Voice of America, the USA's international non-military radio broadcasting service, had been established and Giorgio was exposed to be-bop via the Cool City program on VOA. (In 1964, his father having died and left him some money, Giorgio would return to Ascona and stage a jazz festival in a local airfield.) He attended a progressive private school, the School of Humanity run by Paul Gehheb, in the mountains of Switzerland. While on vacation, with friends, he travelled around Europe by bicycle. In post-war Germany, they found a thriving cellar-jazz scene in towns like D√ºsseldorf. They visited Milan, and pedalled all the way to Paris to see Charlie Parker perform at the Salon de Jazz. His mother was a hat designer. Her father had worked for the Soci√©t√© des Bains de Mer (the casino operator) in Monte Carlo, a popular resort for the British, and so she spoke English and became an anglophile, with a particular love of English literature. Thus her employer, Claude Saint-Cyr of Paris, sent her to run her atelier in London. She would send her Swiss schoolboy son the English music paper Melody Maker on a weekly basis, from which Giorgio learned English and also became familiar with the British jazz scene. There was still at this time limited opportunity to hear new jazz in Europe, apart from Willis Conover on VOA. There was an Italian jazz radio show; Flavio Ambrosetti's show on Swiss Radio ran just 20 minutes a week; there was Charles Delaunay jazz show on Europe 1 in Paris; and Charlie Fox on the BBC; and maybe a couple of German shows. There was a scene in Copenhagen. Aficionados in many cities set up jazz appreciation societies, and Giorgio and friends set one up in Locarno. A trio was formed, Roland Schramlei on bass, Bert Armbruster on piano, and Giorgio on drums. Resources were so limited that, only possessing a ride cymbal, Giorgio would have to hire a drum kit every time they had an engagement. The main jazz magazine was Les Cahiers du Jazz from Paris, and there was also one in Italy. In both countries the magazines organized the local Jazz Societies into Federations which could then stage concert tours. Giorgio followed their model and formed a Swiss federation that staged concerts. In 1954, having been denied permission to stage a concert during the Zurich Festival by the city fathers, the Federation staged a daring protest on a Sunday. The resulting publicity persuaded the City to reverse its decision, and thus the Zurich Jazz Festival was born (and exists to this day).Eurock Interview posted July 2003 Having become a Swiss citizen, Giorgio had to perform National Service, undergoing basic training with Swiss Air Force, where he flew Bucher biplanes. Although a proficient pilot he deliberately failed promotion tests and, after rejection, was then free to leave the country. Film making in England The weekly readings of the Melody Maker, and the lack of further documentation, convinced Giorgio that his vocation would be to film the burgeoning UK jazz scene. He had seen the 1948 film Jammin' the Blues and had formed forward-thinking stylistic ideas including synchronised fast cutting. He succeeded in obtaining a 500 UKP commission from a young Italian TV station and departed for England. In London he established a relationship with the National Jazz Federation, run by Harold Pendleton, who also managed Britain's top jazz star of the time Chris Barber. Despite Giorgio's inclination to shoot the avant-garde Johnny Dankworth, Pendleton prevailed on him to shoot Chris Barber. The resulting piece, comprising four songs, intercut establishing and audience reaction shots from the Royal Festival Hall with separate studio session footage. The studio footage, shot in one day, used cutting-edge technology like large Mitchell cameras with 'elephant' suspended mics that restricted camera movements in the small studio, preventing Giorgio from getting all the angles he had hoped for. This first film was sufficiently well-received that two years later Giorgio filmed Chris Barber for a second time ‚Äì now a 3 camera shoot in b&w; Cinemascope. Harold Pendleton had started the National Jazz Festival and Giorgio had participated as a volunteer helper at the first one in 1959. He was able to secure the rights to film the 1960 festival. A producer/backer was found ‚Äì Frank Green, the owner of a facility on Wardour Street where Giorgio had edited his earlier films. Filming was with 4 b/w cameras. Sound was recorded on the Leevers-Rich synchro-pulse system, allowing separate recording of audio on magnetic tape. The intercom between the cameras was the Royal Artillery's system which, designed to be heard over cannon fire, was so loud that at times it would get picked up by the stage mics. Giorgio edited two pilots from the footage, including a piece of the new Alexis Korner Blues Incorporated with Charlie Watts on drums, but Green was unable to find a buyer. British rhythm & blues Chris Barber's trad-jazz band had launched the skiffle craze, and their hit \\"Rock Island Line\\" had made the band's banjo player Lonnie Donegan a star. As skiffle became pass√©, Chris, whose sets were structured around the history of jazz, began to feature blues in its place, utilizing his school friend vocalist/guitarist Alexis Korner, and harmonica player Cyril Davies. While the Barber blues set was strictly country style, Korner was set on expanding the sound to incorporate the more modern electric Chicago sound and an improvisational jazz approach. He formed his own group Alexis Korner Blues Incorporated and recruited musicians like drummer Charlie Watts and saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith.. Giorgio, then writing for Jazz News, became inspired by this to the extent of becoming evangelical. He coined the term BRB ‚Äì British Rhythm and Blues, wrote articles, and bent the ear of anyone who would listen. Alex and Cyril had a club in a pub upstairs room on Wardour Street where blues aficionados would gather on Wednesdays but they needed a larger venue for the noisy big band. With some difficulty, and support from Barber, Giorgio persuaded Pendleton to run a weekly Blues Night on Thursdays at his newly opened neighbouring club The Marquee. Korner's new band, and others, were duly booked. However the audiences were still limited to a small group of enthusiasts and the future was uncertain. A Jamaican Blue Beat club just off Portobello Road (immortalized in the move Scandal) was one of the hottest spots in London at the time. On a visit Giorgio had a chance encounter with its most notorious clients ‚Äì Christine Keeler & Mandy Rice- Davies. He invited them to visit the Marquee Blues Night and they showed up the following week. The publicity generated was enough to give the night sufficient cachet to become fashionable and successful. Giorgio wanted to build on the success of The Marquee Blues night with more shows but Pendleton wasn't interested. Giorgio began to organize the bands, suggesting that they work co-operatively to obtain bookings and do other business, just as the earlier Jazz Societies had federated their efforts. He even persuaded the Portobello Jamaican club to host a couple of blues bands, however the regular patrons were not impressed. Giorgio then discovered an alternative venue ‚Äì the Cy Laurie Piccadilly Club in Ham Yard. Formerly a major London hotspot, it was now on its uppers. He was able to secure a Saturday night for a fee of $5 and proceeded to stage the first festival of British Blues. Bands appearing included Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated, Blues By Six (which included Nicky Hopkins), and the Rolling Stones. Although attendance was slight, as a promotional device Giorgio prevailed on a number of friends to stand in line outside to attract the attention of passers by, and give the impression of a larger crowd. Pendleton was not at all happy with this local competition for his club. The Crawdaddy Club Gomelsky was certain that the vitality of the genre depended on attracting new young fans, and that attracting young fans depended on involving young musicians. Giorgio believed that residencies were the key to building an audience for the new bands and, in an example of the lateral thinking instilled him in the Switzerland mountain school, hit on the idea of eschewing central London and weekday nights altogether ‚Äì to become so far removed that Pendleton could have no grounds for complaint. Thus the Richmond Blues Association was formed and he secured a series of Sunday nights at the Station Hotel in Richmond, a suburb of West London. What Giorgio knew, from his earlier be-bop interests, was that the nearby Kingston Art School was a fertile hotbed of musical enthusiasm, and also there already was an established blues club in the basement of the ABC Cafe in nearby Ealing. Another group having dropped out, The Rolling Stones were given the first residency. The first night only attracted three people, attendance not being helped by Giorgio, in a typical malapropism, accidentally writing \\"Rhythm & Bulls\\" on the advertising sign outside the venue. Nevertheless, the talents of the Rolling Stones, and a promotional scheme that gave complimentary admission to any patron that brought two friends, soon led to healthy crowds. Also, in order to liven up the proceedings, he convinced the Stones, whose repertoire was stretched by the demands of two 45-minute sets, to incorporate a 20-minute rave-up version of Bo Diddley's \\"Crawdad\\" (originally on the 1960 album Bo Diddley in the Spotlight) as the finale of their show. Giorgio had taken on much of the responsibility for managing and promoting the Rolling Stones. Looking to get press on the band, he prevailed on The Richmond and Twickenham Times, a conservative local paper owned by TV presenter Richard Dimbleby, to send a reporter to the Station Hotel. Eventually a reporter, Barry May, undertook to write an article and visited the venue with a photographer. Giorgio also considered he could exploit his reputation as a jazz writer and film-maker to generate interest in the band and entice the jazz critics to visit the Sunday Richmond sessions. He announced that he would make a short promotional film of these \\"illustrious unknowns\\". The news spread and influential writers ‚Äì first Norman Jopling, and then Peter Jones ‚Äì showed up, but no copy resulted. Peter Jones did, however, return bringing his friend Andrew Loog Oldham. Not having the facilities to film the band live at the club, he took them into the RG Jones recording studio in Wimbledon, one of the few independent studios in London at the time. Two songs were recorded and extra footage shot. As Giorgio was editing he got a call from Gay, who was writing his article, asking how to name the club. Giorgio, on the spur of the moment, inspired by \\"Crawdad\\" ‚Äì the high point of The Stones' show, with a chorus of \\"Hey, crawdaddy!\\" - came up with \\"The Crawdaddy\\". Somewhat to his surprise and delight, a full page feature duly appeared in the Richmond and Twickenham Times. Giorgio showed the article to acquaintance Patrick Doncaster, the music critic of the Daily Mirror, the largest circulation British daily newspaper. Doncaster was persuaded to, in turn, visit the club, and a half-page feature duly appeared in the next day's Mirror. The powers that be at Ind Coope Breweries, owners of the Station Hotel, were aghast at the degenerate behaviour displayed in the article and the club was evicted forthwith. Almost immediately Giorgio had to return to Switzerland, for three weeks, as his father had died. His colleague, photographer Hamish Grimes, went to Pendleton, who provided an introduction to Commander Wheeler, director of the Richmond Athletic Association. They had grounds, just a block away from the Station Hotel, where the National Jazz Festival was held. An arrangement was made for the club to move to a room, almost triple the capacity of the Station Hotel, below the grandstand. Later career In the 1960s, Giorgio went on to manage and produce The Yardbirds, and form Marmalade Records. He also signed Julie Driscoll and Brian Auger & The Trinity, and produced early recordings by Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page (both of whom played with the Yardbirds), Blossom Toes, Rod Stewart, John McLaughlin (the 1969 album Extrapolation), Alexis Korner, Graham Bond and Soft Machine. He arranged for British rock musicians to record with American blues musicians, including the Yardbirds featuring Eric Clapton with Sonny Boy Williamson, who was Giorgio's roommate for a period in Britain. Giorgio claims that Sonny Boy jammed with Rahsaan Roland Kirk in all keys on a single blues harmonica made to play in one key. In the 1970s, he became involved with progressive jazz rock bands such as Gong, Henry Cow and Magma. In the 1980s, he was pioneer of digital video, winning awards for his work using the Video Toaster. Through the 1970s to the 2010s, from his recording and rehearsal studio, Red Door (venue), in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, Giorgio continued to nurture and mentor musicians. Following his relationship in the early 1980s with the band Material, he produced \\"Tonka Wonka Mondays\\" at the Bitter End, featuring three bands a night who were unnamed \\"mystery guests\\", and then had professional music critics dissect their performances during the break. At the end of each evening, a better-known featured guest would play their material backed up by \\"The House Band\\" led by composer / arranger Dave Soldier and featuring trumpeter Roy Campbell. Featured guests included Wayne Kramer, Billy Bang, Frank Lowe, and Dennis Charles. Giorgio was also a regular DJ at the club Tramps, introducing fans to an array of styles, including new African and experimental jazz music. With the producer Joe Papp, early b-boy hiphop stars including Futura 2000, Mr. Freeze, and composers Dave Soldier and Mark Mazur of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, he attempted to produce the first hip-hop musical, Persons, at the Public Theater in 1982. He was instrumental in bringing the important Czech group, the Plastic People of the Universe, to the international public eye by producing a benefit concert for the band's lyricist Egon Bondy at The Kitchen on 29 January 1989, featuring their exiled saxophonist Vratislav Brabenec and New York musicians including the Soldier String Quartet, Craig Harris, Borbetomagus, Elliott Sharp and Gary Lucas, who played the Plastic People's repertoire. News of the concert in Prague is said to have helped to inspire the Velvet Revolution, a movement strongly influenced by experimental American rock and jazz music. Giorgio was involved as guide, producer, and supporter of various New York bands including D Generation, 101 Crustaceans and Band of Susans. Material In 1978, having received a substantial royalty payment for his work with The Yardbirds, Gomelsky relocated to New York in an attempt to open up the American market to the European progressive jazz-rock bands he was working with. He established the Zu Club in Manhattan and after meeting 24-year-old bass player Bill Laswell, encouraged him to form a band, which began rehearsing in the club's basement. The band became known as the Zu Band until Gomelsky hooked them up with former Gong frontman Daevid Allen for a performance at his Zu Manifestival at the Zu Club on 8 October 1978 (and for a 24-hour music festival at Entermedia, a performance space on the Upper West Side of Manhattan), for which they became 'New York Gong'. Allen and the band amicably parted company when they \\"discovered they couldn't stand the European way of life\\" during a tour of France. The band then took the name Material, and their debut recording was 1979's instrumental post-punk industrial funk Temporary Music 1 EP for Gomelsky's Zu Records. Production work * Soft Machine's first demos were recorded by Giorgio. * Gong's Flying Teapot and Angel's Egg (both 1973) were created under Giorgio's auspices. * Aphrodite's Child 666 (1972) (credited as \\"passing by\\") * Vangelis Hypothesis and The Dragon (1971) (unfinished ‚Äì released later in 1978 unofficially) Death Gomelsky died of cancer on 13 January 2016 in New York City. He was 81.

On October 6, 1790, in Redstone meetinghouse, Joshua Hunt signed the Quaker marriage certificate following the wedding ceremony of Abel Campbell and Susanna Dixon. On July 27, 1791 Joshua purchased a property, consisting of a dwelling and of land, from John and Sarah Cadwallader.Deed Book A, p. 359‚Äì360; Recorder of Deeds, 61 E. Main St., Uniontown, Pa. 15401. The conveyance from John and Sarah Cadwallader to Joshua and Esther Hunt is nearly illegible. However, a few years earlier, in 1786, the Cadwalladers had purchased the same property from John and Ann Jones. And that conveyance, recorded on page 141 in Deed Book A, is legible. Comparing this conveyance with the Fayette County warrant map, which is located in the office of the Recorder of Deeds, reveals that the property the Joneses conveyed to the Cadwalladers had been all of their \\"Union Green\\" property (previously owned by Thomas Downs, father of Ann Jones) plus that was part of their adjoining \\"Mount Pleasant\\" property. Thus, the warrant map, which is also published in \\"The Horn Papers, Vol III\\", establishes the boundaries and precise location of the property purchased by Joshua and Esther Hunt. Located on the south bank of Redstone Creek, Hunt's farm was about two miles (3 km) east of the creek's confluence with the Monongahela River and slightly to the west of Colvin Run.The confluence of Colvin Run and Redstone Creek is located at and its elevation is 800 feet above sea level. Their homestead, which they named \\"Hunt Pleasant\\", consisted of a log dwelling nestled amidst walnut trees and steep hills. Rachel Hunt, Esther and Joshua's seventh child and only daughter, was born October 24, 1791.Hynes, p. 24 After returning from a trip back home to Moorestown, Joshua Hunt died February 26, 1792.Hunt Family Papers, \\"Biography of Joshua and Esther Hunt by their children\\": \\"‚Ä¶in the 9th mo of that year our Father returned to Moorestown to settle his business, was about 3 Weeks, and on the 26th of 2nd mo 1792 he died, aged about 39 years.\\" He was 39 years old. Esther Hunt wrote about her husband and her concerns: > He was one endowed with the savor of Truth, a good neighbor, a tender > father, able to instruct his children, temporally and spiritually; except > the Lord help we shall perish. My loss is inexpressible, having my dear > companion taken from me by death, and I left in this strange land with six > children, the youngest about four months old. I can but mourn under a sense > thereof, though not as one without hope. Esther decided to remain at Hunt Pleasant. The ages of her children ranged from Elisha, who was a little over 12 years, to Rachel, who was just four months. Now a widow, Esther continued to run the farm and raise her children alone, without her \\"dearest companion and bosom friend\\".Specht (2003), p. 27 Nevertheless, in June 1794 she was appointed an elder in the Redstone Monthly Meeting, a reflection of the high esteem that she was held by the men and women of her faith.Comly, John and Isaac Comly (editors) (1839), Friends' Miscellany, Vol. XII, Philadelphia, Pa.: J.

The campaign, founded in 1999, comprises not-for-profit and non-governmental organisations including Oxfam and the National Housing Federation. It scored a success in 2003 when it successfully pressed for a Competition Commission investigation into the UK 'Home Credit' or door-to-door lending market. The subsequent inquiry, which completed in late 2006, found against the industry and estimated that around ¬£75 million per year was being made by lenders as a result of a lack of price competition in the market. Remedies, including compulsory data sharing to allow borrowers to build up credit scores and access cheaper alternatives, are due to be introduced in 2007. More recently, the campaign has broadened out to include activity against a variety of 'predatory lenders' in the UK including payday loan lenders and rent-to-own shops, whilst also promoting local action to increase access to affordable credit following its 2005 report, Scaling Up for Financial Inclusion. Founder member and Chair of Debt on our Doorstep, Damon Gibbons, also sits on the Organising Committee of the European Coalition for Responsible Credit, which has organised a series of conferences to promote debate and dialogue between consumer agencies and the financial services industry on issues including usury, responsibility, and fair access to financial services.

Publication history The five novels were published between 2003 and 2013: * The Gates of Rome - released 2003; * The Death of Kings - released early 2004; * The Field of Swords - released late 2004; * The Gods of War - released 2005; * The Blood of Gods - released May 2013. The series was well received by many critics, but also drew comment that Iggulden sometimes changed historical facts either through ignorance or in order to create a more thrilling narrative. This is partly acknowledged by Iggulden, and noted at the end of every novel. The most notable change in the main plot features Caesar and Brutus growing up as childhood friends (Brutus was in reality 15 years younger than Caesar and sometimes rumoured to be his son, though this is unlikely). This gives the series some complexities similar to the movie 1900, in which two boys who grow up together are shaped by their differences, culminating in diverging destinies on the Ides of March. Apart from Caesar and Brutus, historical characters include: Gaius Marius, Cornelius Sulla, Mithridates VI of Pontus (who is described as \\"a Greek general\\"), Cinna, Cornelia, Pompey, Crassus, Cato the Younger, Spartacus, Crixus, Brutus' mother Servilia, Octavian and his mother Atia, Titus Annius Milo, Publius Clodius Pulcher, Vercingetorix, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, Lucius Sergius Catilina, Mark Antony, and Cleopatra VII of Egypt, who gives Caesar a son. Plot overview * The Gates of Rome - spanning from 92 BC to 82 BC (Caesar at eight years of age to the victory of Sulla). Caesar grows up with his childhood friend Marcus outside Rome, terrorized by the slightly older chubby neighbor Suetonius Prandus. Caesar and Marcus are trained to be warriors under the tutelage of ex-gladiator and soldier Renius. After Caesar's father and others are killed in a slave revolt, the children go to Rome to join Caesar's uncle (in reality not related by blood) Gaius Marius and the populares faction. Marius, who is consul, is waging a political war against the conservative optimates led by Cornelius Sulla, the main antagonist. After a triumph celebrating Marius' victory over African tribes, Sulla sails off to Asia Minor to fight King Mithridates VI of Pontus. Meanwhile, Marius takes possession of Rome and Caesar falls in love with Cornelia, daughter of a popular. Marcus goes to Macedon to join a legion as he is, by his non-noble birth, not in position to become a senator. Upon Sulla's return, civil war rages (historically, though simplified) between him and Marius. By having left soldiers in Rome, Sulla succeeds in capturing the city and kills Marius when he refuses to surrender. By his dying breath, Marius asks his loyal men to defeat Sulla. After days of tough street-fighting in which Caesar is captured, Sulla emerges victor and is proclaimed dictator. He asks Caesar to join him, threatening him with torture and death if he refuses. Upon seeing the young man irresistibly wanting to turn his back on his dead uncle, Sulla lets him go. Forced to flee Rome, Caesar does so and joins the navy to go to Egypt. Meanwhile, Marcus has been victorious in campaigns against barbarians and has opted to lengthen his contract. He does so, and when asked to sign his name, reveals the surname Brutus (Marcus Brutus). The book closes with Brutus being praised for his great valor. * The Death of Kings - spanning from 81 BC to 71 BC (Cornelia's pregnancy to the defeat of Spartacus). Opening in the Aegean Sea, Caesar leads a group of men to attack a rebellious fortress in Mytilene (historical) and he is saluted for his courage. Meanwhile, Brutus is forced to flee Greece upon having late meetings with a young woman. Accompanied by cruel but magnificent gladiator Renius, he sets off to Rome. Meanwhile, Cornelia is terrified as Sulla haunts her. Upon raping her on the night where her and Caesar's daughter Julia is born, Caesar and Brutus' friend Tubruk (caretaker of Caesar's estate when they were young) kills Sulla and manages to escape uncaught though others are tortured and killed. Caesar is caught by pirates and forced to ransom 20 talents. He suggests 50 instead, and upon being released on the African coast he builds up a minor army, manages to find the pirate in Greece and takes revenge. Upon landing in Greece, he finds out Sulla is dead and decides to go home. Meanwhile, defeated but surviving, Mithridates makes war yet again against Rome and Caesar goes into battle with him, managing to defeat and kill the king (the title of the book, suggesting Sulla and Mithridates. This event is fictitious as Mithridates was historically defeated by Pompey and committed suicide more than ten years later.) Upon returning to Rome, Caesar rises as a lawyer and manages to claim Marius' old house and send the optimate housed in it (Antonidus) into slavery, making enemies among the optimates. Upon the rebellion of Spartacus, Caesar follows Pompey while Crassus rallies the troops and hunts down the slave army. Cato, who secretly had Pompey's daughter killed as revenge for Sulla, now lets murderers kill Cornelia and Caesar returns in sorrow to Rome. Upon tracking down the assassin, Pompey kills him and Cato. Crassus builds a wall to trap the slaves on the coast. Caesar goes out to fight the last battle, depressed but encouraged by old friend Cabera, a healer and friend of Renius. Spartacus fights the last battle against Pompey and, seeing his slaves are defeated, he puts on his helmet, grasps his sword and charges into the battle, predicting Rome will fall one day. The book closes with Crassus and Pompey riding along the Via Appia towards Rome, passing six thousand crucified slaves. The two have been assuming power and, having exiled Caesar to Hispania, enter the city, with Pompey believing Caesar will be no more than the man who he already is. * The Field of Swords - spanning from 67 BC to 49 BC (Four years after the defeat of Spartacus to the crossing of the Rubicon). Caesar is in Spain, still depressed after his wife's death and with no plans of further advancement. Pompey and Crassus rule Rome as consuls, while Brutus's mother Servilia travels to Spain to meet her son. Caesar goes out to ride with her and they fall in love, dividing Brutus and Caesar for the first time as Brutus unintentionally sees his mother and best friend in bed together. Soon returning to Rome, Caesar rallies to become consul but is disturbed as Crassus reveals a conspiracy to him, led by the insurgent Catiline. Taking his Tenth legion (originally created by Brutus as Caesar was in Greece), Caesar defeats Catiline, whose supporters are brutally executed by Pompey. Confronting Crassus, Caesar reveals that he knew Crassus was the mastermind of the whole conspiracy, yet no others, including Pompey, know this. After becoming consul, Caesar goes to Gaul to fight an eight-year war, spanning half the book. After finally defeating the Gaulish high king Vercingetorix, where his old friend Renius dies in battle and Cabera shortly before, prophesying he saw Caesar fall on the Ides of March in Rome. After bloody battles between street gangsters Clodius and Milo, burning down half the city and killing them both, Pompey assumes power and is proclaimed dictator. With only him and Caesar left, he orders Caesar dead by a spy who refuses to carry out the assassination and also warns Caesar not to go into Rome alone as Pompey would want him dead. Standing at the Rubicon, Brutus says Caesar will always be his friend and have his support, whether they should invade Italy or go hide forever in Gaul. Uttering \\"the die is cast\\", Caesar crosses the river and goes to Rome. * The Gods of War - spanning from 49 BC to 44 BC (the crossing of the Rubicon to assassination on the Ides of March). Pompey flees Italy as his troops are insufficient. Caesar takes the city, saying he is no tyrant nor dictator and just wants to purify Rome from men such as Pompey. As he finds himself ignored, Brutus joins the hot tub party with Pompey instead. Ultimately going to fight him in Greece, Caesar is defeated by his once-friend Pompey at Dyrrhachium but takes revenge at Pharsalus where he reunites with Brutus, though the latter won't forgive him. They follow Pompey to Egypt to receive his head and is soon caught in battle between Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy. Upon sleeping with Cleopatra, Caesar joins her party and captures Ptolemy. As he is released, Caesar is besieged but manages to defeat Ptolemy's troops along with his minister Panek (historically Pothinus). After a romantic trip to the Nile and the birth of Caesar's only son, he returns to Rome but once again disagrees with Brutus, as the latter wants to preserve the republic. Brutus, encouraged by his mother, passes from ignoring Caesar to join Cassius and Suetonius Prandus to have Caesar killed. Going alone to the Senate on the Ides of March, Caesar is attacked and asks Brutus to kill him as he never wanted his old friend as an enemy.

She was portrayed by Farah Fath from October 24, 2007, to June 29, 2011. She returned as a ghost on August 1, 2011, remaining on contract throughout the break, and began a back-from-the-dead storyline in October that wrapped during the show's final week on air. Storylines =2007‚Äì10= Gigi was born in 1979 and was briefly presumed dead from June to October 2011. When she was around 17, Gigi gave birth to Shane in 1996. Gigi is first introduced as a waitress at the Bon Jour Caf√© in Paris, Texas, who constantly argues with diner owner Moe Stubbs. She is a single mother having trouble making ends meet, as her son Shane's father was a Navy SEAL who had died in action. Not realizing that co-worker Viki Davidson is wealthy and is only working as a waitress to temporarily escape her life in Llanview, Pennsylvania, Gigi tells Viki her dreams of becoming rich; Viki tells Gigi that rich people have problems too. Gigi is eager to help when she meets fugitive Marcie McBain (using the name \\"Sally Ann\\"), who is on the run with adopted son Tommy (whom she calls \\"Billy\\"). At first Gigi believes that \\"Sally\\" is running from an abusive husband but soon discovers differently when Tommy's father Todd Manning comes to the Bon Jour looking for his son. Todd offers $1 million for information on Marcie's whereabouts; feeling loyalty towards \\"Sally Ann\\", Gigi gives Todd false information to lead him astray. Gigi gets Marcie a job at the Bon Jour. More of Gigi's mysterious past comes to light when Rex Balsom shows up at the diner; Gigi and Rex dated during their senior year in high school, but Rex had abruptly disappeared in 2002 when he left for Llanview. Gigi clearly has unresolved issues with Rex but hides them and later refrains from telling him \\"something\\" that she feels he needs to know. Rex has come to town searching for Marcie, but Gigi again lies and sends Rex on the wrong trail. Gigi also sells Rex Marcie's engagement ring, which Marcie is anxious to sell for cash. When Marcie's ring is recognized back in Llanview, her husband Dr. Michael McBain and his police detective brother John race back to Paris to confront Gigi. But Todd Manning and renegade FBI agent Lee Ramsey are already there, having taken Gigi and Shane hostage. Ramsey forces Gigi to lure Marcie back to Gigi's apartment before she and Tommy can skip town, and threatens her at gunpoint. Marcie arrives at Gigi's place, but at the last moment Gigi screams for Marcie to run. Ramsey and Todd pursue Marcie, and Gigi and Shane are rescued by the McBain brothers. On January 11, 2008, Gigi is arrested for aiding and abetting a fugitive during Marcie's standoff with the police and FBI at the Bon Jour Caf√©. Viki pays Gigi's bail, and the charges are ultimately dropped. John brings Gigi and Shane to Llanview to testify for Marcie in her trial. Rex's fianc√©e Adriana Cramer discovers Shane's existence and suspects that he is Rex's son. Rex refuses to believe it, and Gigi confirms that Shane's father is a deceased Navy SEAL. Gigi is troubled as Rex begins getting closer to Shane. On March 17, 2008, she admits aloud that Rex is Shane's father.Gigi confirms that Rex is Shane's father in the March 17, 2008 episode. On the day of Rex and Adriana's wedding Gigi stands up and confesses her love to Rex. Adriana responds by punching Gigi. Right before Gigi leaves the wedding, her not-so-dead boyfriend Brody Lovett appears, hoping to win back Gigi and Shane. Rex realizes that Adriana has been lying to him about many things, including the fact that she had found Brody and brought him to Llanview to keep Gigi at bay. Rex and Adriana decide to spend some time apart, and she takes an extended business trip to France. Rex and Gigi's feelings for one another continue to grow, and Gigi finally tells Rex that Shane is his son. Meanwhile, Brody's post-war trauma is worsened by the threat of losing the \\"family\\" he has constructed with Gigi and Shane; he kidnaps Shane and accidentally shoots Rex. With Rex in a coma, Gigi tells Shane his true paternity, but a bitter Shane is devoted to Brody and refuses to believe her. Adriana returns to take care of an unconscious Rex and get rid of Gigi once and for all, but finally realizes that Rex loves Gigi when he awakens at the sound of her voice. Adriana agrees to a divorce, and Rex and Gigi move in together with Shane, who has warmed up to the idea of having Rex in his life. Gigi's sister Stacy is working as on exotic dancer in Las Vegas; on February 6, 2009, she spots Rex and Gigi there and follows them back to Llanview. Stacy decides she wants Rex for herself just as Shane is diagnosed with leukemia; learning of a matching donor, Stacy pretends that she is the match and forces Gigi to break up with Rex in exchange for her blood. Gigi reluctantly arranges for Rex to come upon her in bed with Brody and ends things with Rex. Shane receives the transplant and improves, but Gigi is afraid to reveal Stacy's blackmail in case Shane needs more of her stem cells. In June 2009, Schuyler Joplin stuns Gigi with his theory that Stacy had switched someone else's stem cells for hers. On June 29, 2009, Gigi tells Rex the truth and they reunite, Rex planning to deceive Stacy until they find out who the real donor is. Rex turns the tables on Stacy and retrieves the extra bag of blood she had saved from the real donor. Gigi and Rex plan to send Stacy packing, but Rex's one night with her has left her pregnant; she initially gloats but soon miscarries after a heated argument with Gigi. Stacy avoids telling Rex she has lost the baby, and Schuyler professes his feelings for Gigi. Stacy becomes pregnant again by Oliver Fish and pretends she is still carrying Rex's baby; Rex and Gigi's relationship collapses. Gigi is drawn to Schuyler. Rex's crazed biological father Mitch Laurence kidnaps Stacy in February 2010, intending to raise her baby as his heir; when she reveals that the baby is not Rex's, Mitch abandons Stacy in a blizzard. Gigi finds her, takes her to a cabin, and on February 11, 2010, helps Stacy deliver a baby girl she names Sierra Rose. On February 16, 2010, Stacy falls through the ice of a frozen lake; despite Rex and Oliver's attempts to save her, she disappears beneath the ice and is presumed dead. In Spring 2010, Gigi breaks up with Schuyler for keeping the secret that he and Stacey slept together, and states her intention to challenge him for custody of Sierra. Schuyler takes Allison's gun and holds Gigi at gunpoint at Viki Buchanan's cabin and tries to force Gigi to sleep with him. He once more says that he wants Gigi back in his life but Rex and the police find them. Schuyler is sent to prison for shooting Bo and Rex persuades Gigi to allow Oliver Fish to have primary custody of her niece. Throughout April and May, Gigi grows closer to Rex and helps him find out about his real parents. As a result of their efforts, by May 21, 2010, the couple find themselves languishing in a Santa Fe jail cell for breaking and entering in a jewelry store. Their friend Penny gets them released from jail and provides them with some key information. On May 26, Rex and Gigi stumble onto an old abandoned house in the New Mexico desert. While looking in the house for clues they find some old love letters addressed to \\"Lili\\" from \\"Rick\\" from back in the 1970s. In the last letter Rick states that he is not coming back and that he is in love with someone else. While Lili is reading the letter, the viewer can see she is already several months pregnant with Rick's child. Gigi sympathizes with Rex over his parents' sad story and takes his hand as they walk away. After Bo and Nora's second wedding, Rex accompanies Gigi back to her home. There they realize that through it all, they still love each other and reunite. Through the summer, Gigi uses her own experiences with motherhood to lend moral support to Rex's sister Natalie, who is dealing with an unplanned pregnancy of her own. As of November 2010, she is studying art at Llanview University and is happily involved with Rex. Rex and Gigi are trying to help their son deal with being bullied. Shane had been viciously bullied by Jack Manning and his friend Brad Kozinski in high school. Their cruelty includes taking his clothes and putting a naked video on the Internet; taking his rescue inhaler while Shane had been having an asthma attack; and writing vicious things on his MyFace page. Shane, so broken by what was happening to him, goes up to the High School roof, intent on committing suicide. Rex and Gigi go up to the roof and gently talk their son down from killing himself. The family is now going through therapy. Rex asks Gigi to marry him, and she accepts, because they love one another and also to give Shane a real family for the first time. Because of Jack's bullying ways, Gigi openly refuses to serve him at the cafe and offers no sympathy for him when Shane finally stands up to him by crushing his foot with a barbell. =2011‚Äì12= On June 14, 2011, the day Gigi is supposed to be married, Jack is trying to set up Shane online, and Gigi decides to take it into her own hands. Jack poses as a girl named Comicgirl15 on Myface who is interested in Shane and his comic books. He invites Shane to a party so he and his friends can lock Shane in the basement of a rental home owned by Brad's dad. Shane immediately figures out that Comicgirl15 is Jack and tells his mother. Gigi makes Shane leave, goes on his Myface account, and finds out where this proposed party is. When she gets there, they lock her in a basement, thinking that it is Shane, and leave her. She sees an old generator and turns it on, which causes carbon monoxide to leak into the windowless room. Gigi notices the leak and tries desperately to break out but cannot. She records herself saying that Jack Manning did this to her on a tape that Roxy gave her as a wedding present but realizes it is Marty Saybrooke's session tape where she confesses to Dr. Buhari that she changed Liam McBain's paternity test results, so she decides not to so Natalie can be with the one she loves. She finally passes out. Rex, Shane and Roxy are waiting for Gigi at the courthouse. They run into Jack who wonders why Shane is there and how he escaped. Rex goes on Shane's Myface account to find out where they were planning on messing with Shane. He goes to the home and frees Gigi, who is lying still on the floor holding the tape recorder. The recorder is left on the floor as Rex takes Gigi to the hospital. He tells Roxy and Shane to meet him there, and Shane threatens to kill Jack if anything is wrong with his mother. Rex sends Shane to his therapist and sends Roxy to make sure he gets there and gets news from the doctor that \\"they were too late.\\" As it turns out, Gigi's brain was deprived of oxygen for too long, and on June 16, 2011, she is declared brain dead. On June 29, 2011, Gigi is taken off life support to transplant her heart into Clint Buchanan. The only way that Rex would allow Clint to have Gigi's heart is if Clint agreed to turn over the entire Buchanan fortune to him, lock, stock and barrel. This way, Rex and Shane could go after Todd and Jack and make them pay for what they did to Gigi. In the week of August 1, Rex receives a visit from Gigi. When Rex needs her the most, she suddenly walks away and disappears on August 2, 2011. After telling Echo this, she feared he was losing his mind then on August 3, Rex saw Gigi again tried to convince Echo she was real and also tries to convince her but she has some worries for her son leading her to think he was just having a hallucination of her instead of really seeing her. Natalie gets a psychic named Madame Delphina to find out why Gigi keeps appearing to Rex. She finds out that someone from the dead says \\"Spotted Pony\\". Rex later finds out from David that there is a strip club in Anchorage, Kentucky called The Spotted Pony. Rex, along with his sister Natalie, wants to go there to find out more by using the Buchanans' private jet. When Rex and Natalie arrives at The Spotted Pony, Natalie is mistaken for a stripper by one of the strippers at the club. Rex sends Natalie back to the jet, and wants to go back home after he feels he found no leads on Gigi, until he hears the announcer at the club announcing the next stripper out on the stage. The name of the next stripper turns out to be \\"Gigi\\" which is a stage name being used by Kimberly Andrews, who was the best friend of Gigi's dead sister Stacy! Rex confronts Kim about why she is using his late fianc√©e's name. Kim says that she's using her name to pay respects to Stacy, since Stacy used \\"Gigi\\" as her stripper stage name in Las Vegas. Rex tells Kim that Gigi had died, and wants Kim to know if she can help him find Gigi for him. Kim says that she can't help him find Gigi. Rex tells Kim about all the things that happened in Llanview since she left town a year and a half ago before he leaves Kentucky to go back to Llanview (that Rex is Clint's and Echo DiSavoy's biological son; that Clint had a heart attack and needed Gigi's heart; Rex blackmailing Clint and extorting the Buchanan fortune and mansion from him in exchange for Gigi's heart). After Rex leaves Kentucky, Kim heads to the local hospital in Kentucky to visit a mysterious woman in her room. Kim tells the mystery woman that Rex was in town to investigate The Spotted Pony, and that he encountered her there. She also tells the mystery woman that she's going back to Llanview to win back her ex-husband Clint's heart, and to still get the piece of the Buchanan fortune, and to confront David for blackmailing her out of town with a mysterious secret that she was hiding from Clint. Kim leaves the mystery woman, promising to have her taken care of by the hospital staff while she is gone. After Kim leaves, it is revealed that the mystery woman is Stacy, Gigi's sister, thanks to a picture that is shown of Stacy and Kim that sits on her nightstand next to her bed! On August 25, 2011, Rex while visiting Gigi's grave, it shows her birth date, however, her death date is scratched out. Kim after Rex leaves stops by to visit Gigi's grave. Rex digs up Gigi, to see if she is indeed alive. Rex discovers Gigi's dead body in the casket, meaning that Rex is definitely seeing Gigi's ghost after all. Unfortunately, Rex also discovers that Shane witnessed his mother's grave being exhumed, and is very angry at Rex about what he did to his deceased mother. Kim later visits Gigi's grave after her grave is exhumed and buried again by Rex. Kim lays a bouquet of flowers she stole from Asa Buchanan's grave, and lays them next to Gigi's grave. On October 10, 2011, it is revealed that Stacy had plastic surgery to look like her sister Gigi. Kim remembers that she was reunited with Stacy when she came to the Spotted Pony while she was working there that she survived drowning in that frozen lake by getting out of the water and also had plastic surgery done to her in South America so that she could take over her sister's life. Kim disagreed with her plans and followed Stacy to Llanview. Kim tracked her down by going to Rex and Gigi's Llanfair carriage house where she saw Shane's laptop computer that she was headed to a rental house, where Shane's bully from high school Jack and his friends was setting up a trap for him as a cruel prank. When Kim went to the basement in the rental house, she saw Gigi already lying braindead, while Stacy was lying unconscious in another room in the basement, both of them poisoned by leaking carbon monoxide. Kim grabbed Stacy and put her in her car to take her to be treated in a hospital in Cherryvale before she moved to the Kentucky hospital after she fell into a coma. Kim is also unsure if it was Stacy that she rescued in the basement, hinting that maybe if Gigi was the one to survive after all. On October 14, Stacy wakes up from her coma, where she is later to be watched after by Kim's con artist brother and former grifting partner Cutter Wentworth, (Kim was set up to take the fall for her brother's murder of a wealthy man named Mr. Berger, who she and Cutter was scamming back when she was a con artist, when he put too much \\"mickey\\" into his drink while she was seducing him by working as a stripper at the Spotted Pony. Kim's old French boarding school roommate Rama Patel helped conspired against her with Cutter so that she could avenge her for stealing her money to pay for her plastic surgery to improve her looks.) who decides to use Stacy to fool Rex thinking that his wife Gigi is still alive, so that he could use her as leverage to get to Rex's Buchanan fortune. Cutter went to meet Rex at Buchanan Enterprises when he was leaving his office. Cutter asked Rex to let him sign his name on the paperwork to hand over his family's fortune to him in exchange to bring Gigi back to him after he told him that she was still alive. Rex didn't believe Cutter, even after he tried to show a photo of Gigi he took of her on her hospital bed on his cell phone, with Rex thinking the photo of Gigi could be fake. Rex got into an ugly fight with Cutter before Bo broke up the fight. Cutter left the building saying he will regret his decision to not take up on his offer to reunite with Gigi. Back in the Kentucky hospital, \\"Stacy\\" looked up details about Gigi and Stacy on the Internet on Cutter's laptop computer he left behind in her room. \\"Stacy\\" left the hospital to go to Llanview to stop by the Llanfair estate for a visit. Tina Lord opened the front door, and asked who she was, and \\"Stacy\\" told her that she thinks she's Gigi, and if she used to live there. Tina told her that she'll ask her relatives about Gigi. Tina told her niece Jessica Buchanan about Gigi, and Jessica told her that Gigi is dead. Tina returned to the door, but found that \\"Stacy\\" was gone. \\"Stacy\\" went to Gigi's grave site at the cemetery, and still felt very confused about her identity. Cutter found \\"Stacy\\" at the cemetery, and \\"Stacy\\" asked Cutter why she looks like her dead sister. Cutter told her that she wasn't Gigi, but she was her sister Stacy. Cutter told her that she survived drowning in that frozen lake, and got plastic surgery to look like Gigi so that she could take over her life, and that she also survived being trapped in that basement with the carbon monoxide leaking. Cutter also told her that she was rescued by her friend Kim, and that she took her to the hospital after she went into a coma. Cutter took \\"Stacy\\" to his home with her after she left a flower on Gigi's tombstone. The next morning, \\"Stacy\\" wakes up in bed at a motel room she shares with Cutter at The Minute Man. She asks Cutter if he knew anything about her life, and Cutter promised he would tell her everything she needed to know after she took a shower. After \\"Stacy\\" got out of the shower, she asks who he was arguing with at the door, and Cutter tells her it was his ex-girlfriend, but is not honest about what they were talking about. On October 28, Cutter convinces \\"Stacy\\" to crash Brody and Natatlie's costume themed engagement party at the Buchanan Mansion on Halloween night with him so that when she sees Rex and Shane at the party, it could help her get her memories back. Cutter is dressed as a mummy and \\"Stacy\\" is dressed as Little Red Riding Hood wearing a mask on her face when they both arrive at the mansion being greeted by Rex at the front door. Cutter and \\"Stacy\\" enter the mansion to attend the party. \\"Stacy\\" tells Cutter that she felt strong feelings towards Rex when she first saw him at the front door. \\"Stacy\\" discovers a Halloween greeting card with a recorded voice by Gigi. Shane approaches her and thanks her for finding the card for him before she left him to escape to the stables when Shane asks for her name. Cutter finds \\"Stacy\\" with her mask off and puts it back on her when Aubrey arrives to take his mask off to foil Cutter's latest scheme. Rex also arrives at the stables and finds \\"Stacy\\" with Cutter. \\"Stacy\\" and Cutter leaves the party to head back home. The next morning after \\"Stacy\\" wakes up from dreaming about Rex, she confronts Cutter about why she's using her to get to Rex. Cutter explains to \\"Stacy\\" that he's helping her to reunite with Rex, and for him to get the Buchanan fortune from him, while they both benefit what they both want from Rex. Cutter also reminds \\"Stacy\\" that she used to be a con artist herself, and that's how she got to Rex before. After Cutter leaves the motel room, Rex goes to the door to break into the room to find \\"Stacy\\" himself. \\"Stacy\\" hid in the bathroom before Rex entered the room where she heard Rex scold her for trying to fool him to think that she was his dead fianc√©e Gigi. After Rex left the room and confronted Cutter about his scam after he arrived back home, \\"Stacy\\" told Cutter that she wanted out of their deal so that she could get plastic surgery to look like her old self again. On November 14, \\"Stacy\\" gets ready to board a flight to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to reverse her plastic surgery before she is stopped by Cutter at the airport. \\"Stacy\\" tells Cutter that she doesn't want to be part of his scam anymore, because she doesn't want to continue to hurt Rex and Shane by teasing them with her appearances haunting them in Llanview. Cutter becomes touched by her change of heart and drops his scam against Rex, and lets her go to Brazil on the condition that he can come along with her on the trip. \\"Stacy\\" asks Cutter about his past after they board the plane, and Cutter told his tragic past about how his father William J. \\"Billy Joe\\" Wentworth Jr., who grew up poor but became rich after investing his money in the stock market as a stock trader, was abandoned by his wife, and his and Kim's mother Alexandra, when his father suddenly committed suicide after becoming depressed and alienated himself from his loved ones after he failed to find his missing wife who took off with some of his money. Cutter also told her that he and his sister ended up in the foster care system after their father died, and he ran away from all of his foster homes to find Kim after he was separated by her going into the foster care system. He eventually found her, and they took care of themselves by becoming con artists to try to regain the wealth that they lost in their early childhoods. \\"Stacy\\" felt sorry for Cutter after hearing about his past. \\"Stacy\\" and Cutter arrive in Rio in the waiting room outside of plastic surgeon Dr. Fascinella's office. \\"Stacy\\" and Cutter asks a nurse if they can find out if she had surgery there. The nurse gets \\"Stacy's\\" file and is shocked to see the before and after pictures of her surgery. Cutter and \\"Stacy\\" wait to see the doctor when Cutter's estranged mother Alexandra (who later revealed herself as Alex Olanov) comes out of the plastic surgeon's office to complain about a botched surgery on her cheek. After Cutter confronts Alex about abandoning her family and tells her about his father and her husband's suicide, Alex tells Cutter to talk to her in a private room to explain her side of the story. \\"Stacy\\" tells Cutter that she will be there for him as \\"back-up\\" if he needs her when he talks to his mother. Cutter and Alex enter the private room, when Cutter suddenly strangles her to avenge her for walking out on her family. \\"Stacy\\" enters the room to stop Cutter from choking Alex. When Rex and Aubrey arrive in Rio in the waiting room outside, Cutter involves Alex in his scheme to help hide \\"Stacy\\" from Rex and Aubrey, so that Alex can make it up to Cutter for abandoning her family. After Cutter and Alex fool Rex and Aubrey with their scheme, Alex gives Cutter her business card to contact her if he ever needs her help and wishes both Cutter and \\"Stacy\\" good luck before she goes back home to St. Blaze's Island. Cutter vows to \\"Stacy\\" that she will get her plastic surgery the next day. On December 1, Cutter comforts \\"Stacy\\" after she wakes up from a nightmare about Gigi's death and being trapped in that carbon monoxide poisoned basement. Cutter confides in her about his fear about being a lot like his mother, who was a con artist like he became in his life. \\"Stacy\\" reassures Cutter that by going along with her to Rio to reverse her plastic surgery and dropping his scam against Rex, that he was on the path to redemption. Cutter planted a kiss on \\"Stacy\\". \\"Stacy\\" pulls away from Cutter after she is surprised that he kissed her. Cutter tells \\"Stacy\\" the reason that he kissed her was because he started to develop feelings for her, and that she helped him reform his grifting ways. \\"Stacy\\" and Cutter get a call from her plastic surgeon Dr. Fascinella to remind them about their scheduled appointment. \\"Stacy\\" and Cutter arrive at the doctor's office to have \\"Stacy\\" examined before her surgery. Dr. Fascinella asks Cutter into the waiting room with him so they could have a chat about \\"Stacy\\". Dr. Fascinella tells Cutter that the woman he just examined isn't Stacy but the woman that she based her altered looks on, which was her sister Gigi. Cutter figures out that \\"Stacy\\" was really Gigi, and that she was the one that really survived being trapped in that contaminated and toxic basement, and that Stacy was the one that really died and her heart was donated to Clint. Cutter still made Gigi think she was Stacy by saying that she could not have the surgery because of the toxic fumes she was exposed to. Gigi and Cutter go to Paris, Texas after they randomly pick out their next destination on a globe so that they can start their new lives as a couple. When Gigi and Cutter stop by the Bon Jour Caf√©, Gigi starts to get a feeling of d√©j√† vu when she realized she probably worked there in her past. Cutter agrees with Gigi that she is getting her memories back. Gigi and Cutter get jobs at the Bon Jour Caf√©. Gigi works her old job as a waitress, and Cutter gets a new job as a dishwasher. Cutter tells Gigi that he does not want to live in a small town like Paris, Texas, (after Cutter realizes that some of the townsfolk may start to recognize Gigi), and instead wants to move with Gigi to Paris, France, but Gigi still wants to stay in town and not move anywhere else with Cutter. Gigi, still unaware who she really is, kisses Cutter and says that there is something between them. Cutter agrees to stay with Gigi in Paris, TX, and leaves the Bon Jour to reserve a room for them at the Bon Sweets Motel. After Cutter leaves, Gigi sees that Viki and Rex have just arrived together at the Bon Jour. Gigi hides in the back room and calls Cutter on her cell phone to tell him that Viki and Rex are in town, and to help her sneak out of the Bon Jour before they see her. Cutter goes back to the Bon Jour, and hires a preacher he meets to distract Viki and Rex while Cutter sneaks Gigi out of the Bon Jour. Gigi and Cutter check out of their motel room to leave for their next destination. When Gigi steps out of the room to leave though, she sees Rex and Shane are staying at the same motel. Gigi rushes back in the room, and tells Cutter that they can't leave town yet because Rex and Shane are staying at the motel. Gigi passes out, and remembers seeing Kim talking to her after she rescued her from the trapped basement that was leaking carbon monoxide. Gigi also learns from Cutter that Stacy's friend Kim is in prison for murdering a rich guy at the Spotted Pony strip club in Anchorage, Kentucky, unaware that Cutter really committed the murder, and framed Kim for the crime. Cutter agrees to stay in Paris, Texas, until Rex, Shane, and Viki all leave town. On December 20, Cutter and Gigi prepare to leave town until Cutter was distracted by the motel clerk about his payment not coming through to his credit card, and Gigi sneaks out of the room to go outside. Gigi arrives back at the Bon Jour Caf√© to return her waitress uniform when she sees Rex, Shane, Viki, Moe, and Noelle inside. Cutter finds Gigi and tells her that he worked out his payment problems to the motel clerk so that they can finally leave town to board a flight to Las Vegas, Nevada. Gigi recognizes a man named Professor Delbert Fina Jr. when she sees next to him at the airport (the professor's father helped Rex and Gigi return to their present time when they both time traveled to 1968) where he tells her his personal motto to \\"don't give up\\" (which is the same message that was haunting Rex when he was haunted by visions of Gigi). Gigi leaves the airport to go back to the Bon Jour Caf√©, where she finally sees Rex face-to-face for the first time since her \\"death\\". Rex scolds Gigi (still thinking she is \\"Stacy\\") for pretending to be her sister, and trying to scam him out of the Buchanan fortune with Cutter. Gigi tells Rex that she was trying to get her memories back when she showed up at the Buchanan Mansion on Halloween night, and that Cutter later dropped his scam to help get her plastic surgery to look like Stacy again, but could not get the surgery because she was in a coma because of the toxic fumes she inhaled being trapped in that basement. Rex still disbelieves her (even though Gigi remembers previously working at the Bon Jour Caf√© in Paris, Texas) and gets into a fight with Gigi, but Cutter arrives at the Bon Jour to break up the fight, and to finally confess that \\"Stacy\\" really is Gigi. Rex dis believe Cutter when he tells the truth, and tells Gigi that Cutter murdered a rich guy back in Kentucky and framed his sister Kim for the crime. Rex has Cutter tied up until the police arrive to have Cutter arrested and taken away to a prison in Kentucky. Rex continues to argue to Gigi (as \\"Stacy\\") about her part in Gigi's \\"death\\" until Professor Delbert Fina Jr. arrives at the diner to help Rex and Gigi figure out what happened on the night of Gigi's \\"death\\" by hooking up his time traveling remote control to a TV set so that they could all witness the night of Gigi's \\"death\\". On December 23, 2011, it is revealed by Professor Fina's time traveling device that \\"Stacy\\" is indeed the real Gigi, who escaped the basement (along with Stacy switching her clothes and Gigi's wedding dress to wear to fool Rex) and lost her memory after she knocked out Stacy in self-defense. Rex and Gigi woke up with each other the next day at the Bon Sweets Motel, grateful that they are together again. Rex also tells Gigi that Stacy's heart, not Gigi's, was donated to Clint after he suffered from a heart attack. Rex calls Shane to tell him that he has a surprise for him when he comes back home, and Shane tells him that he has a surprise for him, too. Rex and Gigi return to Llanview, and Rex explains to Shane that his Aunt Stacy was the one that died in the basement, not his mom and Shane and Gigi are finally reunited. Gigi finds out from Rex that he and Aubrey were in a romantic relationship with each other when he thought that Gigi was dead, and that his feelings towards Aubrey disappeared when he found out that Gigi was alive. Rex went over to the Buchanan Mansion to tell Aubrey the truth about Gigi/Stacy and to break up with her, while Gigi and Shane went over to the police station to reveal Gigi still being alive after Shane told Gigi and Rex that he put Jack in jail for being responsible for Gigi's \\"death\\", even though Stacy really died in that basement instead. Gigi surprised T√©a and Jack with her appearance after thinking that she was dead. Gigi was ready to confront Jack, but Shane told her that he wasn't worth getting even with anymore since he wasn't really responsible for her death. Gigi met and surprised John and Natalie with her appearance, and remembered that she had the recorder with the tape that had Marty confessing to her doctor that John was the biological father of Natalie's child Liam. Natalie reassured Gigi that she already found out the truth before she married Brody where he confessed to knowing the truth about Liam's paternity. Gigi and Shane left the police station to go to Llanfair, where Gigi reunited with Viki and Clint. Rex showed up to surprise Gigi by proposing to her again.

Begun in 1933, it was published in fascicles between 1968 and 1982; a lightly revised second edition was released in 2012. The dictionary was created in order to meet the need for a more modern Latin-English dictionary than Lewis & Short's A Latin Dictionary (1879), while being less ambitious in scope than the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (in progress). It was based on a new reading of classical sources, in the light of the advances in lexicography in creating the Oxford English Dictionary.  History  Although Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary was widely used in the English world by the end of the nineteenth century, its faults were widely felt among classicists. While Oxford University Press had attempted the creation of a new Latin dictionary as early as 1875, these projects failed. The OLD was spurred by the submission of a report in 1924 by Alexander Souter on the deficiencies of Lewis and Short; he eventually became the dictionary's first editor. The compilation of the more than one million quotations on which the work was based began in 1933. After Souter's retirement in 1939, Cyril Bailey and J.M. Wyllie were appointed co-editors. From 1949, Wyllie was the sole editor, and he was replaced, following tensions among the editorial staff, in 1954 by P.G.W. Glare, who remained in the position until the completion of the lexicon. The dictionary was originally published in eight fascicles at two-yearly intervals from 1968 until 1982. The complete dictionary contains c. 40,000 entries (covering 100,000 senses). It was generally well received by classicists. Other members of the editorial staff included C.O. Brink (1938‚Äì42), E.A. Parker (1939‚Äì46), M. Alford (1942‚Äì45), J. Chadwick (1946‚Äì52), B.V. Slater (1947‚Äì49), D.C. Browning (1949‚Äì50), W.M. Edwards (1950‚Äì69), J.D. Craig (1952‚Äì53), C.L. Howard (1952‚Äì58), G.E. Turton (1954‚Äì70), R.H. Barrow (1954‚Äì82), S. Trenkner (1955‚Äì57), R.C. Palmer (1957‚Äì82), G.M. Lee (1968‚Äì82), and D. Raven (1969‚Äì70). In 2012, a second edition of the dictionary was published in two volumes (the binding of the 1982 single-volume edition has a tendency to fall apart under the paper's weight), removes some English translations now considered to be archaic, and presents the material in a clearer fashion using the Arno typeface.  Comparison with other dictionaries  Although the OLD was intended as a replacement for Lewis and Short's dictionary from 1879, its lack of information about Latin writings from after AD 200 has drawn criticism from its users. Lewis and Short's coverage of late and ecclesiastical Latin (if inconsistent), combined with the fact that this dictionary is freely available online, has meant that it has remained in continuous use. The Thesaurus Linguae Latinae is far more ambitious than the OLD, but after more than 100 years only two thirds of this comprehensive dictionary has been published.

Personal life  He was born in Moulmein (present-day Mawlamyine, Mon State) in 1864. He was the son of a Burmese Chinese father with ancestry from Amoy, China, Taw Sein Sun (ÊùúÊàêÂ≠´) who worked in shipping operations along the Burmese coast in the 1840s. His mother Daw Nu () was probably a Mon lady.Relocating the interlocutor: Taw Sein Ko and the itinerancy of knowledge in British Burma Later, their family went north. Taw's father became a well-known merchant in Bhamo. Taw married to the daughter of Tan Htun (who died in October 1910), a merchant in Rangoon. Taw studied in \\"Mandalay's Dr. Marks School\\" together with the princes of the Royal House of Konbaung, including Prince Thibaw in 1871. Taw graduated from Rangoon College in 1881 and read law at the British Inner Temple, Inns of Court in 1892.  Career  Taw Sein Ko joined the Indian Civil Service in 1884. In 1886, he wrote Maung Po: A Product of Western Civilization. Throughout the 1880s to 1910s, he was a prominent advocate of university education and education of women in Burma and lobbied for prioritising Buddhist education in the British- led state curriculum. He was an advocate for modernising Burma's medical education system, and unsuccessfully lobbied for incorporating indigenous treatments and practices into school curriculum. He was also instrumental in re-instituting nationwide Buddhist scripture examinations in Pali for Buddhist monks in 1895 and the appointment and election of a Buddhist Supreme Patriarch in 1903. In 1893, he became the Assistant Secretary to the Government of Burma. That year, after completing his first archaeological tour of Mon areas, he published his findings where he advocated for the preservation of the Mon language through conservation of manuscripts and relics at various museums in Burma (Bernard Free Library and Phayre Museum) and England. In 1897, he was sent as part of a government delegation to Peking (now Beijing) and appointed Government Burmese Translator, concurrently with the positions of Archaeologist and Adviser on Chinese Affairs for two years. During the 1899‚Äì1900 Boxer uprising, he served as a Warden of the Frontier Areas, and helped to establish an Anglo-Chinese School. In 1902, he returned to his position as Assistant Secretary. From 1903‚Äì1905, he served his terms as Government Archaeologist and Adviser on Chinese Affairs. In 1906, the government re-designated the position of Government Archaeologist as Superintendent of the Archaeological Survey. In 1903, Taw Sein Ko was awarded the Gold Kaisar-i-Hind Medal from Delhi Durbar. On 12 December 1911, King George V bestowed upon him the Imperial Service Order decoration. In 1917, he was knighted by King George V (1865‚Äì1936) with the Imperial Service Order as the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire. He died at the age of 66 years in Mandalay and left behind six sons and one daughter.  Legacy  Taw Sein Ko was the founder of Bagan Archeological Museum, Myanmar. In 1902, he founded a small museum near Ananda Temple in Bagan, which became present-day Bagan Archeological Museum.

But, when Manchester University decided to trial older women she applied and graduated. She wrote articles about her travels in Greece and they were published in various education magazines. She also had an interest in fossils and sometimes went to the North Yorkshire coast to collect. Her first manuscript was a romance about Delphi where she had visited.

Career In 1973, she became a launch author for the new Harlequin Presents line of category romance novels. Harlequin Presents books were more sensual than the previous line, Harlequin Romance, under which she had been published.

Classed as a Historic Monument both for its exterior and interior, Ch√¢teau de Vendeuvre Vendeuvre is a prototypical aristocratic Norman country house. It was opened to the public in 1983.  For the visitor to see  * State rooms giving a taste of daily life in the 18th century. * The extensive museum of miniature furniture. * 18th- century kitchens. * A collection of furniture and bedding for pampered pets. * Formal, utility and water gardens. * A shell-lined grotto. * Pavilions and follies  History  Vendeuvre was built between 1750 and 1752 from the plans of architect Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel and is a great example of a country house (maison de campagne) of the eighteenth century. Its owner, Alexandre Le Forestier, ‚Äò'seigneur‚Äô' of Vendeuvre, coming from a Cotentin family that claimed descent from the Counts of Flanders, wanted a modern summer retreat built in the style of the day. The old manor-house was demolished, as it was damp (it was closer to the Dives river-banks than the present building) and built partially into the hillside slope. During the French Revolution, Alexander of Vendeuvre and his family lived at Rouen, their house at Caen having been burned down. As the family didn't emigrate during the Revolution, the chateau was saved from destruction, thus preserving the original d√©cor and most of the furnishings. The ch√¢teau is famous for its eighteenth-century interiors. Blondel paid particular attention to the highly sophisticated interior circulation and decoration. The facade is deliberately not ostentatious, as, according to Blondel, in his influential architectural thesis,Blondel, De La Distribution Des Maisons De Plaisance, Et De La Decoration Des Edifices En General (Paris, 1737‚Äì38) ‚Äòit is absolutely vital to avoid useless ornamentation and excessive facades that detract from the quality of what is inside‚Äô. After the ch√¢teau was damaged during the Second World War, the present Count of Vendeuvre, a direct descendant of Alexander of Vendeuvre, set about the complete internal and exterior renovation of the chateau. The slate roof was re-laid in 1945. Following the completion of the interior renovation, the park's restoration followed in 1970, using the original 1813 plans as a basis for the garden's classic French style. In 1983 the Orangery was restored to its former state, having also been badly damaged as a result of action during the war.  Interior  The suite of rooms en filades In the presentation of the ch√¢teau, each room presents a theme of eighteenth century daily life. Automatons (mannekins with recordings) point out the salient features of each room: * The dining room demonstrates the art of receiving and entertaining guests. * The state bedroom, with many wardrobes, is devoted to dressing and make-up. The automaton represents a lady of the time, enjoying the pleasures of washing and dressing in her boudoir. * The office exhibits paraphernalia associated with writing. . * The small parlour displays family portraits. * The Grand Salon shows the pleasures of indoor games. The chateau's plan shows that it is twice as wide as it is deep, with a suite of state rooms distributed around a central hall supported by Ionic columns. The layout of the suites (each leads to the next) and the rounding of all the corners, help to spread the natural light throughout each room. The quality of the wood panelling in the main room is remarkable. The furniture is a comprehensive list of 18th century craftsmanship. There are many curiosities too: a chandelier with real goldfish in a bowl, a travelling enema kit and a ‚Äò'voyeuse‚Äô', a chair with a padded elbow-rest upon which elegant ladies would kneel or sit whilst playing indoor games, so as not to crumple the arrangement of their dresses over wide panniers.  The Kitchen  The Kitchen Copper and tin vessels of all shapes and sizes, with old earthenware and faience containers, give the impression that this beautifully arranged kitchen could still be used. Under the stone vaulted ceiling, in the huge fireplace, stands a mechanical rotisserie, still in working order. In a corner of the fireplace there is an oven, which was used for broiling and pot- roasting. In the other corner of the fireplace, lumps of wood were permanently smoldering. These were transported, using large pans, to the oven opposite, or to one of the five smaller fireplaces situated in the wall opposite, where slow-cooked dishes, such as soups and sauces were prepared. Set into the wall of another corner is a smaller oven once used for pastry-baking. All the wood ash would have been collected and sifted for use in the household laundry.  Pet pampering  Cat's bed - France, Louis XV period Dog's chair - France, 19th century In a room next to the kitchen is a unique collection of pet- carriers, baskets and kennels. Small dogs and cats were the object of much care and attention, as testified by the refinement and variety of sumptuous places in which they lived, slept and travelled. Some were even provided with bedding matched to the full-sized furniture of the room in which they were placed, others were miniature versions of the furniture, but gilded. Some of the very ornate kennels had three compartments. The cat's bed, in the photograph opposite, is √† la polonaise with a dais and drawn-up curtains, and was made for one of the daughters of Louis XV of France for her pet. Louis XV himself had a King Charles Spaniel called Filou (Rascal). Its bed was a cushion of crimson velvet and it wore a gold collar encrusted with diamonds. Louis XV said of his dog: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the only thing in the world that likes me for myself‚Äù. These small ‚Äòpet-dwellings‚Äô are extremely rare and unusual reminders of times past, when pets were often looked after better than the workers of the estate. The formal parterre of lawn and gravel with box-hedging  The Gardens  = Formal Gardens = The formal gardens that have been created by the present Count of Vendeuvre, have a strictly symmetrical classical lay-out of closely clipped scrolling designs set against gravel reserves, and borders and box hedges set in lawns, with a formal water beyond, flanked by pollarded lime trees (lindens), against a background of mature woodlands. Beyond the sloping fields of the valley of the river Dives, the hills of the Pays d'Auge can be seen in the far distance. Restored according to plans, of 1813, these French geometric gardens perfectly complement the equally symmetrical garden front of the ch√¢teau. The pyramidal ice house = 'Utility gardens = An avenue of 150-year-old limes or lindens, to the side of the chateau, marks the area of the ‚Äòpractical‚Äô or ‚Äòutility‚Äô gardens. An essential part of the ch√¢teau during the 18th ‚Äì 20th centuries, providing much home-grown food, the so- called practical gardens include: *A fish pond containing, at one end, trout for special occasions and at the other end, separated by netting, the more common freshwater fish for Fridays and other fasting days. The fish would have been fed from kitchen scraps and pellets of flour. *A dovecote, rebuilt in 1811, which has over 1400 dove holes. The roof was designed to catch some rainwater for the birds to bathe in. *An Ice House built as a pyramid, to store the ice from the pond in the winter maze. It has a north-facing door to better help preserve the low temperature within. = The 'Surprise' water gardens = During the Renaissance, mankind became fascinated by hydraulic mechanisms. They were particularly fashionable in France in the 17th and 18th centuries, to entertain, amaze and charm. To add a further dimension to their parks and gardens, artificial devices to imitate nature have found their place, most notably in the form of fountains.  The Crystal Tree  The Crystal Tree Linked to a legend from antiquity, of a tree that drew, by its roots, all science and wisdom. Around it, plants were cultivated and fertilized by the spirits of the place. This celestial tree offered, to those that it chose, a dew that transmitted wisdom and eternity. Since earliest times, trees have been the object of worship, perhaps because their roots attain the underground depths and their branches symbolize the aspiration of ascension towards the sky.  The fountain of the Muses  Inspired by another legend, this time of a young gardener discouraged by the failure of his garden, who went looking for help from the Hippocrene fountain, created when Pegasus had kicked the ground with his hooves. Whoever drank of the water was sure to be inspired by the Muses. Once asleep, the gardener dreamt of four men: a gardening technician, a man of good taste, a poet and a painter. They said to him that they, individually, were incapable of creating a great garden, but that together they had built the most beautiful gardens of the world. On his awakening, the gardener tried the fountain's water whilst praying that the Muses would grant him the four gifts necessary to his profession: technique, good taste, poetry and art. Laughing, they instead gave him green fingers.  The tortoise cascade  The tortoise cascade The tortoise plays an important role in the mythology of many cultures. In Central America, according to an ancient legend, the rain god Chaac had fallen under the charms of a beautiful goddess and forsaken the land. A severe drought reigned throughout the country of the Mayas but Chaac no longer heard the invocations of the priests. As a last recourse, the Mayas asked the sacred tortoises to intervene with the rain god. Hoisted on the roof of the temples and houses, the tortoises called out his name ‚ÄúChaac‚Äù as one voice, which brought him to his senses. At his invitation, the tortoises spat water, quenching the thirst of the Mayans and saving the harvests.  The water nymph‚Äôs grotto  The grotto Neptune, Greek god of the sea, was enticed by the beautiful and wise nymph, Cl√©ance. One day, he threw himself upon her, but Cl√©ance defended herself so well that Neptune backed off. \\"The coldness of rock will suit you\\", he said, transforming her immediately into stone. Shocked by this, the other nymphs implored Thetis to intercede with the gods on Olympus for the restoration of her life. Not being able to do anything against the power of Neptune, they agreed on a compromise: Cl√©ance would remain a stone statue but inside, her heart could carry on beating.  The Shell Grotto  Under an exotic copper-roofed pavilion is a \\"cool room\\" where one can rest during hot summer days. According to Greco-Roman mythology, a young nymph, followed by the god Pan, took refuge in the cave, taking on the form of a fountain of pure water. This grotto is inspired by that mythological cave. The 200,000 shells used on the walls at Vendeuvre help to recreate the supernatural atmosphere that suits a dwelling of the nymphs.  The Temple of Serenity  The Temple of Serenity Evocative of the story of a powerful king in a rich country where the inhabitants were very happy. The King, always a worrier, was continually dissatisfied with his position and with that of his kingdom. He went to consult the Wise Woman of the Lost Wood that prescribed meditation at the ‚Äòtemple of the eight columns‚Äô. The king entered the temple but after only a few minutes all his problems had returned. He was going to leave when it began to rain all around the temple, preventing him from leaving. Little by little, the light music of the raindrops on the ground helped lighten his anguish. Passing through the veil of rain, all at last seemed well with the world. On the ground in front of each column of the temple was a single letter, carved out by the rainwater. The letters spelt the word ‚ÄúSERENITY‚Äù  The Chinese bridge  The Chinese bridge Chinese legend has it that a very beautiful girl named Yin never tired of looking at her own reflection in the water whenever she took a walk across the red bridge. Han, the bird-catcher, opened his heart to her, but Yin rejected it, because the water only showed the reflection of his graceless face. Moved by the sadness of the bird-catcher, the doves began to spit in the water, which immediately reflected the souls of the two young people. Yin's reflection became distorted by her vanity whilst Han's reflection illuminated the surface. This vision melted the heart of Yin and the couple loved each other so much that, on certain evenings, one can make out their silhouettes leaning on the scarlet bridge. = The Mazes = The regular labyrinth Labyrinths were places of escape. It was said that whenever anyone had worries, a walk in the mysterious labyrinth helped one escape the real world if only for a short time. The gardens of the ch√¢teau of Vendeuvre contain two mazes, known as the 'regular maze' and the 'field maze' * The regular labyrinth is a mass of yew hedging and white rose bushes in the lawn. * The field labyrinth covers a surface of one hectare. A green paradise of rare trees and many wonders, towards the Japanese tea pavilion. Here, all visitors are encouraged to take part in the hunt for a small rabbit.
