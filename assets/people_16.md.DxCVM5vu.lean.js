He showed his best form as a two-year-old in 1998 when he won his first three races by wide margins, culminating in a victory in the G1 Middle Park Stakes. He made no impact in three subsequent races and was retired to stud at the end of 1999. He had little success as a breeding stallion. Background Lujain was a bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by his owner, Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. He was sired by Seeking the Gold who won the Super Derby, the Peter Pan Stakes, the Dwyer Stakes, and the Swale Stakes in 1988. He went on to become a very successful breeding stallion whose other progeny included Dubai Millennium, Flanders and Jazil. Lujain's dam Satin Flower was a high-class racemare whose wins included the Jersey Stakes in 1991 and went on to produce the 2005 UAE 1000 Guineas winner Satin Kiss. She was a great-great-granddaughter of Lea Lark, an American broodmare whose other descendants have included Tobougg, Miswaki, Almutawakel, Southern Halo, Peter Davies and White Muzzle Sheikh Mohammed sent the colt into training with David Loder at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1998: two-year-old career= Lujain began his racing career in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 18 July and started the 4/9 favourite in a nine-runner field. Ridden as in all his races that year by Frankie Dettori he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by three and a half lengths from Indian Warrior. On 4 September the colt started odds-on favourite for a minor race at York Racecourse and won \\"very easily\\" by five lengths from Trinity. On 1 October Lujain was stepped up in class for the Group One Middle Park Stakes and was made the 8/11 favourite against six opponents. His opponents included Sheer Viking and the Irish challenger Borromini who had finished first and second in the Flying Childers Stakes. The other runners were Bertolini (July Stakes)m Sailing Shoes (runner-up in the Gimcrack Stakes), Belasco (third in the Mill Reef Stakes) and the John Dunlop-trained Vision of Night. Dettori restrained the colt in the early stages before making progress down the centre of the course and taking the lead approaching the final furlong. He accelerated clear of his rivals and won by four lengths from Bertolini despite edging to the right in the closing stages. After the race Dettori said \\"All of a sudden he just zoomed by them, it was amazing. He's very willing, not lethargic at all. He's the perfect horse\\" whilst Loder commented \\"He's just a superb horse. He's a machine, isn't he? He hasn't been tested yet\\" before stating his confidence in the colt's ability to stay further. Two weeks later, Lujain attempted to complete a rare double when he moved up to seven furlongs for the Dewhurst Stakes and started the 9/2 third favourite behind Stravinsky and the Somerville Tattersall Stakes winner Enrique. He chased the leaders before weakening abruptly in the last quarter mile and finished tailed off in sixth place, more than twenty-two lengths behind the upset winner Mujahid. At the end of 1998 Lujain was transferred to Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation, with Saeed bin Suroor taking over from Loder as his trainer. =1999: three-year-old career= In 1999 Lujain was campaigned over sprint distances, beginning his season in the six furlong Duke of York Stakes at York Racecourse in May. Ridden by Mick Kinane, he briefly took the lead a furlong out before fading into fifth place behind Sampower Star. The colt was reunited with Dettori for the King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot on 18 June. Lujain appeared to recover well from a poor start but weakened in the final furlong and finished twelfth of the seventeen runners. Stud record Lujain was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at his owner's Dalham Hall stud and was also shuttled to stand in Australia. In 2006 he was exported to stand at the Elia Stud in Greece where his last reported foals were born in 2011. His most successful offspring were Mixed Blessing (Princess Margaret Stakes), Ghetto Blaster, a Group 2 winner in Australia, and Stop Making Sense who won the Listed Prix du Haras de la Huderie and finished second in the Prix La Rochette in 2004.

Although RCA was noted for their pioneering work in transistors, RCA decided to build a vacuum tube computer instead of a transistorized computer. It was the largest vacuum tube computer of its time in 1956, occupying of floor space with up to 30,000 tubes, 70,000 diodes, and 35,000 magnetic cores. It weighed about . History In 1949, the Mutual Assistance Program (MAP)‚Äîlater known as the Military Assistance Program‚Äîwas started by the United States to provide military assistance and supplies to foreign countries needing to rebuild their military defenses after World War II. In 1951, RCA was awarded a $4.5 million military contract to build a data processing machine to support the logistics necessary for the MAP. The result was the BIZMAC computer system. The first BIZMAC machine was installed at the Ordnance Tank-Automotive Command (OTAC) in Detroit, Michigan in 1956. Eventually, BIZMAC computer systems were also installed at Higbee Department Stores, Travelers Insurance Company, and New York Life Insurance Company. The huge BIZMAC system was very quickly made obsolete by faster and more reliable computer systems, including IBM's 705 computer as well as RCA's own transistorized 501 computer. The BIZMAC was taken offline from the OTAC in 1962. Only about six BIZMAC computers were actually made. Features A unique feature of the BIZMAC was the use of hundreds of permanently mounted tape drives. This meant that tape data could be accessed immediately without constant mounting and dismounting individual tapes. Engineers One of the original engineers of the BIZMAC was Arnold Spielberg, the father of film director and producer Steven Spielberg. Spielberg designed and patented an electronic library system used for searching data stored on magnetic tapes.https://www.computer.org/web/awards/pioneer-arnold-spielberg Arnold M.

Education and Career  Andrew attended the Bronx High School of Science, earned his A.B. from Brown University, and his Ed.M from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In 2005, Andrew founded Democracy Prep Public Schools in Harlem, New York. The network has grown to serve more than 6,500 students in New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Nevada, and Texas. Democracy Prep has been the subject of significant academic research due to its emphasis on civic engagement. From 2014 to 2016, Andrew served as senior advisor and superintendent-in-residence at the U.S. Department of Education and was a senior advisor in the Office of Educational Technology at the White House under the Presidency of Barack Obama. In 2020, under Andrew‚Äôs leadership, Democracy Builders and Marlboro College announced that Democracy Builders would acquire the Marlboro College campus in order to build a low-residency, low-cost college program for low-income students. The Degrees of Freedom program would last four years, from eleventh grade to the second year of college, and would result in an associate degree. The program is slated to be largely online, with students only being on campus two weeks out of each trimester. Controversy In June 2020, Andrew was the subject of allegations of racism by \\"Black N Brown at DP\\", an anonymous group of Democracy Prep students, alumni, and present/former staff of color.https://medium.com/@wearetheseeds2020/we-aint-buying-it-1d64fc03c0f The social media account claims that that both Andrew himself and the schools he headed were built on an education system of systemic racism and manipulative behavior towards people of color. The Marlboro Selectboard called on the Marlboro College Board of Trustees to investigate allegations of racism at Democracy Prep Charter Schools, which serve predominately students of color.While the Marlboro Alumni Council condemned this, and called for the sale of the college to be cancelled, the Board of Trustees announced they would proceed with the sale following their investigation into the largely anonymous allegations. In July 2020, Andrew and members of Degrees of Freedom claimed that the \\"Black N Brown at DP\\" collective were creating false narratives and stories in order to deter the purchase of Marlboro College.

He first practiced as a member of D. M. Thompson & Company in Providence. When David M. Thompson left the partnership to manage mills for B. B. & R. Knight, Makepeace formed a new partnership, Hall & Makepeace, with established architect Clifton A. Hall. This lasted from 1884 to 1886. Hall was prominent as both a designer of industrial buildings as well as those that normally made up an architect's practice. In 1886 Makepeace left, and opened his own office.Jordy, William H. and Christopher P. Monkhouse. Buildings on Paper: Rhode Island Architectural Drawings, 1825-1945. 1982. He established C. R.

As designer, in 1894, he patented what was known as \\"Praray's Improved Construction\\", a system of mill construction which separated the structure of the roof and floors of a mill from that of the walls, allowing much more daylight to enter the building. Visually, Praray's design may be most noted for its unusual window patterns, which emerge from the brick piers in a zig-zag pattern.Kidder, Frank E. The Architect's and Builder's Pocket-Book. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1908. Only five these mills have been documented as being built, but Chas. A. M. Praray & Company touted it in advertisements for many years.

History  In 970, during the reign of Ramiro III of Le√≥n, a monk named Oveco in the monastery at Valcavado copied and made miniatures on parchment for Valcavado's abbot, Sempronio, of the commentary by Saint Beatus of the Santo Toribio de Li√©bana monastery between 765 and 775 AD. The Valcavado Beatus is among the 32 copies that still exist today of this work, many of them lavishly illuminated. The manuscript by Oveco remained there until the 16th century. Ambrosio de Morales described seeing it there in 1572. But in 1590 it was no longer there. It traveled to Le√≥n and afterwards to Madrid where it was owned by a secretary to Philip II of Spain. In the 17th century, the manuscript belonged to the Jesuit school of Saint Ambrosio in Valladolid, and when Charles III of Spain ordered the Jesuits expelled, the contents of their library went to the University of Valladolid.Garc√≠a-Diego y Alonso Montes, 2012, p. 123.  Description  The manuscript is also known as the Beato of Valladolid. It consists of 230 folios conserved in good condition‚Äîanother fourteen are missing‚Äîmeasuring 35.5 x 24.5 cm and containing 87 miniatures and numerous drop capitals. The bright colors come from azurite, malachite and cinnabar pigments mixed with egg, honey or glue, and varnished with a coat of wax. The figures de of people are limited to lines and their expressivity comes from their large almond-shaped eyes. In the margins of many pages are numerous annotations certainly added by the author during his work, and others made later over the centuries.Garc√≠a-Diego y Alonso Montes, 2012, p. 123-126.

Both Ivan Turgenev and Alexey K. Tolstoy reacted positively, hailing the arrival of the original, even if erratic literary talent, \\"who [was playing] with his gift in acrobatic fashion,\\" according to Tolstoy.

According to the modern literary historian O. Mayorova, Klyushnikov was continuously dogged by financial troubles which might have accounted for the fact that most of his novels and novelets, bear the mark of utter haste, boasting stilted characters and improbable twists of plots. The critic lauded, though, his fine, lively language and occasionally brilliant observations of the real life. In retrospect, she argued, Klyushnikov's major achievement was his work (in 1870-1876, then 1887-1892) as the editor-in-chief of the popular and influential Niva magazine, to which he devoted himself totally. He also published his own Krugozor magazine (1876-1878) which proved to be financial disaster, and edited the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Science between 1877 and 1886.Boris Glinsky. –ö–ª—é—à–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤, –í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á at the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary.

Wedge testified under oath that two sources told him about Judge Murphy's alleged comments regarding the 14-year-old rape victim. Wedge understood, according to his testimony, that these two sources were not present when the rape comment was allegedly made by Judge Murphy. According to Wedge, he then confirmed the quote with a third source who was present when Judge Murphy allegedly made the comment about the rape victim. He \\"refused to concede that his front-page story on Murphy was at all flawed.\\" . The court found Wedge's testimony in the trial to be \\"thoroughly and convincingly impeached by his own deposition testimony,\\" which he gave in July and August 2002.

Murphy testified that the quotes attributed to him by defense witnesses were \\"absolutely preposterous.\\" In February 2005, the jury found that the Boston Herald and David Wedge had defamed Judge Murphy and published false information about him. The jury awarded Murphy $2.09 million in compensatory damages, an award later reduced to $2.01 million. Shortly after the verdict, in an apparent attempt at \\"bullying\\" the Herald into a settlement, Judge Murphy wrote two letters on court letterhead to Herald publisher Patrick Purcell, demanding the publisher meet with him and deliver a $3.26 million check.Ralph Ranalli, \\"Herald fights $2m libel verdict; Says judge wrote 'bullying' letters,\\" Boston Globe, December 21, 2005. Appeal The Herald appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, but on May 7, 2007 the court upheld the verdict. In a unanimous decision \\"sharply critical of the newspaper and its reporter, David Wedge,\\" the Supreme Judicial Court said \\"there is an abundance of evidence that, taken cumulatively, provides clear and convincing proof that the defendants either knew that the published statements found by the jury to be libelous were untrue or that they published them in reckless disregard of the probable falsity.\\" The court found the evidence in the case supported the jury's verdict of actual malice. The Supreme Judicial Court opinion, written by Justice John Greaney, said that \\"by the end of Wedge's testimony, his credibility on any material factual point at issue was in tatters.\\" Reaction and response In the wake of the failed appeal, Boston Herald publisher Patrick Purcell released a statement saying \\"We are disappointed with the Supreme Judicial Court's relentlessly one-sided view of Dave Wedge's reporting on a public controversy within the judicial system, and are unwavering in our complete confidence in Wedge's journalistic skills.\\"Jesse Noyes, \\"SJC upholds judge's libel case vs. Herald,\\" Boston Herald, May 8, 2007. Purcell referred to the letters he received from Judge Murphy saying, Murphy \\"correctly predicted the Herald had 'zero chance' that his colleagues on the bench would side with the Herald rather than one of their own\\" and that \\"no shred of evidence exists, as Justice Greaney alleged in his opinion, that Wedge altered the quotation provided by his trusted sources.\\" Wedge released his own public statement in which he \\"vehemently\\" disagreed with the SJC's decision and continued to \\"firmly stand by\\" his reporting on the stories. On May 21, 2007, the Herald filed a petition requesting the court reconsider its decision, alleging that the SJC judges made several errors in their ruling, including misquoting Crowley's testimony and erroneously suggesting that Crowley said he heard Murphy make a sympathetic-sounding comment.\\"Boston Herald asks SJC to reconsider libel ruling ,\\" WHDH-TV, May 21, 2007. The SJC acknowledged the error, as well as others, and corrected the record but denied the Herald's motion to reconsider, ending the case in the state's courts. The Herald paid Judge Murphy $3.4 million on June 7 to cover the jury award plus interest. On July 10, the Massachusetts Commission on Judicial Conduct charged Judge Murphy with ethical violations including \\"willful misconduct\\" for the controversial letters he sent to Purcell.Raja Mishra, \\"Judge who won libel lawsuit faces ethics charges; Commission says he tried to bully Herald,\\" Boston Globe, July 11, 2007. The CJC held a public hearing on Murphy's letters on October 15.Jessica Van Sack and Joe Dwinell, \\"CJC public hearing set on Judge Murphy misconduct charges,\\" Boston Herald, October 5, 2007. Murphy claimed in August that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and asked Governor Deval Patrick to retire him early with a full pension, even though he hadn't earned retirement benefits. Patrick denied the request.Frank Phillips, \\"Judge in Herald case asks early retirement; Patrick rejects claims of stress,\\" Boston Globe, August 2, 2007. The judge also filed a $6.8 million suit against the Herald's insurance company, claiming that the libel case should have been settled.Shelley Murphy, \\"Judge seeks $6.8 million from Herald's insurer; Cites failure to settle defamation case,\\" Boston Globe, August 18, 2007. In November the CJC issued a 27-page report that found Murphy's letters to Purcell were \\"improper in tone and content\\" and recommended a public reprimand.Andrew Ryan, \\"Report urges public reprimand for judge; Says two letters to newspaper were improper,\\" Boston Globe, November 22, 2007. The CJC recommended a 30-day suspension, a $25,000 fine and a public censure for Murphy for the letters. In August 2008, Judge Murphy and the CJC reached an agreement that he was \\"permanently disabled\\" and he stepped down from the bench.Shelley Murphy, \\"Judge Murphy agrees to leave the bench,\\" Boston Globe, August 20, 2008. In September 2012, the SJC ruled that Murphy was not entitled to a disability pension.

Hunter at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California before moving to the Gurdon Institute at the University of Cambridge then the Institute of Cancer Research in 2015. Pines research investigates cyclin, the cell cycle and mitosis. He pioneered the use of fluorescent tags to analyse the dynamic behaviour and stability of these regulators in living cells. Pines discoveries have revealed that mitotic regulators are targeted to specific substructures at specific times, and that mitosis is exquisitely coordinated by the destruction of key regulators at different times in cell division. Pines work has provided insights into how chromosome behaviour in mitosis controls both the time and the rate at which essential mitotic regulators are destroyed, and these discoveries have wider implications for how cancers develop. =Awards and honours= Pines was elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO) in 2001 and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2005.

Playing career =UC Irvine Anteaters, 2011‚Äì2014= Privett attended UC Irvine where played for the Anteaters from 2011‚Äì2014 and studied Sociology. As a freshman, Privett was named the Big West Conference Freshman of the Year and second team All-Big West. She scored five goals, two game-winners, and assisted on five while registering 14 shots, 9 of which were on goal. During her sophomore season, she started 13 of the 16 matches she played in, recording on assist and seven shots, 5 of which were on goal. As a junior, Privett started 15 of the 16 matches she played, scoring 2 goals and 2 assists, with 17 shots, 7 of which were on goal. =Houston Dash, 2015‚Äì2017= In 2015, Privett played for the Houston Dash as an amateur player. Privett made the Houston Dash's amateur squad after paying a $75 fee to attend an open tryout. After getting an invitation to attend the Dash pre- season, she cancelled her plans to try out for other squads and focused on making the Dash. Between injuries, trades, and the Women's World Cup, Privett became needed in the midfield and made her NWSL debut as a 58th-minute substitute against FC Kansas City on May 2. Dash head coach Randy Waldrum said of Privett making the squad: \\"Cami is kind of a dream story where, I think, I‚Äôll go to the open tryouts and pay $75 to go try out, and, all of the sudden, the next thing I know, a few months later, I‚Äôm playing in my first pro game. You‚Äôd never know that around her; the moment doesn‚Äôt seem to faze her.‚Äù During the Dash's offseason, Privett went and played for the Norwegian club Kolbotn, as a Dash teammate, Rachel Axon, had played there the previous offseason. Although the language barrier made trainings difficult, Privett was able to score goals, get starts, get minutes, and worked on catching up on the \\"speed of play coming from college... is the biggest difference.\\" Of the difference in styles, Privett said that Kolbotn \\"play[s] a lot more direct then we do here [at the Dash].\\" In February 2016, Privett signed a professional contract with the Dash. She made her season debut for the club in the Dash's 0‚Äì0 draw against Sky Blue FC. Privett played in 15 of 20 games for the Dash during the 2016 season, recording 11 starts and tallied 1,059 total minutes. While the Dash had 7 players at the 2016 Olympics, Privett was asked to make a start at the right back position against the Portland Thorns on July 16. Privett had only played on the outside for one season: when she was a freshman at California-Irvine, she played wide midfield. \\"We felt like we needed her on the field,\\" Waldrum said. \\"Missing our national team players, it is about figuring out how we get the best 11 on the field at the same time. If I had put her at center back, then I have to sit Ellie (Brush) or Cari (Roccaro). If I put her at holding midfield, I have to sit Amber (Brooks). All of those players, we need.\\" Privett did well in this position, and continued to be utilized as a rotating substitute or starter at the position for the remainder of the 2016 season. During the 2016 offseason, Privett focused on improving her skills as a defensive back continuing her transition from midfield to out- side defensive back to center back. As part of Randy Waldrum's experimentation with the Dash's backline (that saw Rocarro, Bruna, Van Wyk, Polianna, Levin, Privett, and Daly all get starts), Privett started twice at the center back position on May 20 at Sky Blue and May 27 vs Seattle. Interim-head coach Omar Gonzalez solidified this back line with Levin-Van Wyk-Brooks-Poliana after a shutout victory in Orlando on June 24, starting a 6-game unbeaten streak for the Houston Dash. With Morgan Brian suffering from injuries and Amber Brookes playing on the backline, Privett started at the defending midfield position on July 2 at Kansas City, June 8 vs Portland, and June 15 vs Washington. On June 22nd vs Boston, she played defensive midfield as a 60th minute sub for Morgan Brian. On March 9, 2018 Privett announced her retirement. =EDF Logro√±o, 2018‚Äì2019= After announcing her retirement in March 2018, Privett returned to professional soccer on December 11, 2018 as she signed with EDF Logro√±o in the Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n.

It was the home of the Swedish Navy's staff college, which provided advanced training for officers. It was located within the Stockholm garrison in Stockholm, Sweden. History The Royal Swedish Naval Staff College was established by regulations on 11 March 1898. According to regulations and teaching charters (23 October 1908 with amendments on 29 September 1911 and 29 June 1912) the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College had the purpose to educate naval officers and give them expanded knowledge in those subjects which were important to pursue the purpose of the maritime defense. The education was in 1914 a one-year long general course for subaltern officers and a one-year long advanced course (general, artillery, torpedo and naval mine courses) for officers, who had completed the general course. Subjects covered in the general course were strategy, tactics, coastal fortress, land warfare, military coastal geography, artillery, torpedo, naval mine, physics and mathematics (the latter was optional). In the advanced course teaching was in special subjects, and in some of the general course subjects. The Royal Swedish Naval Staff College permanent staff consisted of a head, an adjutant and librarian, teachers in 15 subjects, rehearsers and a caretaker. During the years 1899-1900 there was only one student in the advanced course, Lieutenant Carl Gustav Flach. According to the regulations issued on 17 September 1923 the education was a one-year long general course, designed for subaltern officers, as well as a one and two-year long higher course (general higher course, artillery, torpedo and naval mine courses) for officers who had undergone the general course. For subjects in the general course, air warfare and naval officer's programme and navigation were added. Only the coastal artillery course included physics. In higher education courses, special subjects were included, and in some of the general course subjects. In 1926 there were teachers in 18 subjects. As students, the Navy's subaltern officers were commanded in turn; an entry qualification was not needed. The Royal Swedish Naval Staff College was discontinued in 1961 and the Royal Swedish Armed Forces Staff College was formed by merging war colleges of the different military branches, namely the Royal Swedish Army Staff College (established 1878), the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College (established 1898) and the Royal Swedish Air Force Staff College (established 1939).

The organization seeks to advocate for the humanities in the nation's two year colleges; although, it does also engage in work with four-year institutions, and much of the association's work is done through grants and affiliations with the National Endowment for the Humanities.  History  CCHA was founded in 1979 through the American Association for the Advancement of the Humanities. CCHA held its first conference that year in Summit, New Jersey, culminating in the publication of Challenges Before the Humanities in Community Colleges: Review and Proceedings of the Community College Humanities Association. Through the years, CCHA has been at multiple institutions as the association has never been a \\"stand-alone\\" association and has always existed and been supported by a community college campus. Most recently, CCHA was housed at Essex County College in Newark, NJ, until the end of 2015. At the beginning of 2016, CCHA moved to the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) and it is currently housed on the Essex campus. The Community College Humanities Association is also a member of the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) Affiliated Council.  Governance  CCHA is governed by a board of directors composed of community college presidents and five elected regional presidents. The current Chairman of the Board is David A. Berry, Professor of Humanities at Essex County College, who won the National Humanities Medal in 1997 for his services to the humanities. In addition, the regular day-to-day work of the organization is overseen by the National Director, Andrew Rusnak, Jr, who is an Associate Professor of English at the Community College of Baltimore County.  Organization and conferences  The association is broken into five regional divisions. These divisions are the Central, Eastern, Pacific-Western, Southern, and Southwestern. Every other year, each of the divisions holds an annual conference within their geographical division. Additionally, national conferences are held in the years between the regional conferences. All conferences tend to be held near the end of October or beginning of November.  Publications  The organization has two publications. The primary and flagship publication is the Community College Humanities Review, a peer-reviewed journal published bi- annually. The second is the Humanist newsletter, sent out at regular intervals during the academic year. CCHA also publishes shorter pieces to the blog Discourse, which is maintained on their website.  Awards and prizes  Each year, CCHA holds a Literary Magazine Competition, through which the magazines of different institutions compete in multiple categories such as \\"best artwork\\" and \\"best poem.\\" Submissions are generally due near the end of May, and winners are announced in August and recognized at the conference(s).  Workshops, grant projects, and summer institutes  CCHA has a long-standing relationship with the National Endowment for the Humanities, and this relationship has led to the creation and implementation of many workshops and summer institutes for humanities faculty.

The series starts off when Relu accidentally kills a man. Day by day, the secrets he keeps become increasingly oppressive and the lies begin to surface, one by one.  Characters  RELU ONCESCU (Serban Pavlu) Relu is a family man and a reliable friend. He is married to Gina with whom he has two children, Chuckie and Magda. They're living together with Uncle Puiu, who, although not a relative, is treated as a member of their family. Seen through the eyes of his family, Relu Oncescu seems to be an ordinary taxi driver. No one suspects that he's actually working as an enforcer for The Captain, a local mobster. In order to provide his family with a better life, Relu recovers money from debtors and in order to be successful, most often than not, he has to resort to threats and violence. Because he is neither criminal nor a psychopath, he has never managed to advance in the hierarchy, always doing the others' dirty work. After accidentally killing a man, he tries to get out of the underworld, but he cannot find a way back, and his life will change forever. GINA ONCESCU (Maria Obretin) Gina is Relu's wife, an extremely loyal woman who gave up any personal aspirations in order to devote herself completely to her husband and two children. She loves her husband passionately after many years of marriage and she's ready to do anything to protect her family. She is a skilled housewife, focused on everyday work: cooking, washing, ironing, cleaning and maintaining the flame of passion alive in her relationship. When she finds out that her husband is leading a double life and has lied to her for years, her universe crumbles and her reactions become unpredictable. UNCLE PUIU (»òtefan Velniciuc) Uncle Puiu is a member of Relu's family. He's living in the same backyard with the Oncescu family, in a modest room that still bears traces of his tumultuous life. He's ready to do everything for Relu, Gina and their children. In his youth, he used to be one of the elite players of one of the most important clans of the underworld but, on the surface, he's been retired for years without losing the esteem of the current bosses. He is the only one who knows about Relu's double life and he covers for him every time. Despite his old age, he still goes to the old sentimental prostitutes he used to protect. Uncle Puiu is Relu's mentor and the unofficial grandfather of his children. NICOLETA (NICO) (Andreea Vasile) Nico is The Captain's (Relu's boss) right hand and the one coordinating the enforcers. She owns a pub which is named after her and where she hosts the meetings of the local mobsters. Nico is a product of this world and she made her way up in the hierarchy carefully and skillfully: she dresses provocatively and she's always top notch. She has a weakness for Relu but, despite all her efforts, he is not interested. THE CAPTAIN (Doru Ana) The Captain is the brain behind all the illegal operations and he is respected and feared by the entire underworld. He knows everything that happens and he's rarely caught by surprise. He's a megalomaniac, apparently full of charisma and affection when, in fact, he exhibits boundless cruelty and an enormous appetite for life manifested in everlasting parties which he organizes as rewards for his \\"boys\\". He does not trust anyone and easily betrays his partners. His only sorrow is caused by Teddy, his only son, who does not live up to his expectations and whom he considers too weak to ever follow in his footsteps. CHUCKIE (Dan Hurduc) Relu and Gina's younger son and Uncle Puiu's favourite. Chuckie is a quiet and clever boy, who loves dinosaurs and who has all the data to become a very good swimmer. He seldom worries his parents. However, when there are problems in the family, the youngest member's reactions are surprising. MAGDA (MƒÉdƒÉlina Craiu) Magda is an intelligent young woman who dreams about being independent though her much too severe father holds her on a tight leash. Always fighting with him, Magda will do her best to ignore him and his decisions. TEDDY (Gabriel Huian) The Captain's only son has passions which seem unacceptable for his local mafia boss of a father: he's listening to classical music, he's an avid reader and he speaks perfect Romanian, often correcting those he comes in contact with. After he meets Relu for the first time, their destinies merge and Teddy shows he's capable of unexpected gestures and decisions. SABIN (Sergiu Costache) Sabin is one of The Captain's boys and he's often sent into missions with Relu. Unlike Relu, however, Sabin has a tough physique and personality and he's vindictive and cruel. He envies Relu for the latter's relationship with The Captain and suspects that there is something between Relu and Nico, for whom he has strong feelings. TOMA (Dorel Vi»ôan) The most powerful and most feared underworld figure, Toma is the only one who can impose conditions on The Captain. He lets the latter wait for him or he shows up when least expected because his status allows it. Episodes =Season 1 (2014-15)= Relu (»òerban Pavlu) is a family man. He has a wife, two children and he leads a double life. Seen through the eyes of his family, Relu Oncescu seems to be an ordinary taxi driver. No one suspects that Relu works as a collector for CƒÉpitanu‚Äô, a local mobster. Neither of the worlds (family and Mafia) he is living in knows about the other. Relu manages to keep everything under control, but not for long. After he accidentally kills a man, he tries to escape the underground world, but he is not able to find a way out. With each passing day the secrets become more and more overwhelming and the lies start coming to light one by one. =Season 2 (2017) = Relu Oncescu and his wife, Gina, are separated. Relu‚Äôs two lives are violently intertwined. Their daughter marries The Captain‚Äôs son, The Captain being the mobster Relu works for. The young couple are expecting a child. Old quarrels are catching up with the children and the parents. Everything has a price in the underground world. Time has passed by and the affairs of The Captain‚Äôs clan have become increasingly more important and thus more suspicious in the eyes of a prosecutor who wants to nail them. Everything is threatened. Relu wants to get revenge and nothing will stand in his way. He is ready to sacrifice everything to seek justice. =Season 3 (2019)= On May 14, 2019, it was announced that the filming for the third season has ended and that the series would return in the fall.https://www.facebook.com/serialul.umbre/posts/1291081691045900 The first episode of the third season premiered at the Transilvania International Film Festival on June 6.https://www.facebook.com/events/2410492822530391/ The third season will premiere on November 20 and it will have 7 episodes. After coming face to face with Emilian last season, the third Umbre installment sees Relu engaging in the full-on hunt deployed against him, using anything, and anyone, to stay one step ahead of his nemesis. It‚Äôs not just his own freedom that‚Äôs on the line, but the entire empire of his mobster family, which is now on track to go global. While The Captain is striving to hold on to the business, his brother Nicu steers it into international waters, with Relu‚Äôs help. Nico has become a pawn on the chessboard where Emilian and Relu try to outwit each other, and playing both sides will wear them to a frazzle this season. Relu‚Äôs family is unraveling and, with Gina seeing Sebastian, Chuckie spiraling out of control, and Magda coming to grips with the loss of her baby, there‚Äôs no thread in sight to pull it back together. Is Relu even trying to anymore? Production The first season of Umbre is based on Small Time Gangster, an Australian comedy series, while the second season is completely original. There was an almost three-year gap between season one and two because Bogdan Mirica directed his debut feature film Dogs, which was awarded the FIPRESCI Prize in 2016 Cannes Un Certain Regard. The second season features 6 episodes but of greater length (almost one hour per episode, compared to 45 minutes in the first season). The Visual effects for the second season are created by Stargate Studios, company that produces visual effects for The Walking Dead, among other TV series.https://simon- formanski.com/projects/umbre-season-2 Broadcast Umbre premiered in Romania on 28 December 2014 (HBO Romania). On 9 November 2015 it premiered on Acorn TV, making it the first HBO Europe original series to be broadcast in the United States.

Things seem to be looking up when Beth returns, however when they meet two more uninfected people their problems become even more complex.  Cast  * Shameer Seepersand as Scott * Jessica Messenger as Beth * Mark Drake as Max * Rachel Benson as Lolli * Gavin Harrison as George * Carl Bryan as Dave  Production  Shooting took place in Derby, England. The film was partially inspired by the 2011 England riots, which occurred while the screenplay was being written. Post-production was reported to be underway in January 2013.  Release  Wasteland premiered at the Festival of Zombie Culture on 16 November 2013. It was released in the US on DVD in September 2015.  Reception  HorrorNews.net initially disliked the film upon their first viewing, but upon seeing it a second time they felt that it was \\"definitely not an exciting, action-packed, zombie flick. It is a slow burn of a film that explores the end-of-the-world questions\\". Ain't It Cool News gave the film a positive review and also commented upon the film's nature, writing \\"If you‚Äôre looking for an action packed zombie romp, this ain‚Äôt it. But WASTELAND has a lot of soul and is quite gripping in the tragic and lonely tale it tells.\\" Horror Society rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"Overall, Wasteland is a solid film that is far from original and not as bloody as one would expect from a zombie flick.\\" References External links * * Actor and Producer Mem Ferda Joins the Zombie Terror in Wasteland 28 Days Later Analysis 11 July 2013 Category:2013 films Category:2013 horror films Category:British films Category:British horror films Category:British independent films Category:English-language films Category:Post-apocalyptic films Category:British zombie films ","title":"Wasteland (2013 film)"},{"id":"50505058","text":"Acacia validinervia also commonly known as nyalanyalara, nyala nyala, alumaru or blue wattle, is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae endemic to arid areas of inland Australia. Description The erect slender shrub typically grows to a height of . It can have a straggly or spindly habit with multiple stems. The glabrous branchlets and branches are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves.

The unification (or re- unification) of Samoa (or Western Samoa), an independent state, and American Samoa, a US territory, both parts of the Samoan Islands which share ethnicity and culture, has been raised since the first half of the 20th century, following division of the territories by the Great powers (see Tripartite Convention). In 1919, Western Samoa desired to unite with American Samoa, as already stated in Paris. However it was instead incorporated as the Western Samoa Trust Territory under British administration from 1920‚Äì1946 and New Zealand administration from then until 1962. The Inter-Samoan Consultative Committee was established in 1955, to promote cooperation between the two. Richard Barrett Lowe, governor of American Samoa (1953‚Äì56), stated that it was decided that reunification with Western Samoa was not to be discussed at the Committee. In 1969, a political commission in American Samoa rejected the unification with independent Samoa. Sentiment for and against unification exist in varying degrees. Some Western Samoan political leaders have argued for Western Samoa to become an American Trust Territory, or for a future reunification with Eastern Samoa. Although American Samoans have a strong Samoan national identity, there is no large movement towards independence or Samoan reunification in American Samoa. American Samoa protested Western Samoa's name change to \\"Samoa\\" in 1997 due to implying Western Samoan authority over the Samoan Islands.

It is believed that regular use of a foot arch stretcher may increase flexibility in the arch, ankle, and metatarsal areas of the foot. A process necessary to avoid foot and ankle injury while participating in athletic activities.  Components  A foot arch stretcher generally consists of two components: a base and a foot sleeve. The base is generally one to two feet long and is made of a rigid material. In general, either the full base or parts of the base are covered with foam or another soft material and overlaid with fabric. This manufacturing process is used to both hold the shape of the foot arch stretcher and to provide comfort for the areas of the leg and foot that will come into contact with the base while in use. Sometimes, additional padding is added to the area of the foot stretcher base that will come into contact with the heel of the foot. This additional padding is added for comfort because the heel area usually receives the most leverage and accompanying pressure during the stretching process. The foot sleeve is attached to the front portion of the base and is usually made of sturdy fabric or elastic. The purpose of the foot sleeve is to hold the foot in place during the stretching process. While this combination of a base and foot sleeve is the standard composition of most foot arch stretchers, it is important to note that some foot arch stretcher models have different components and function in a completely different manner.  Functionality  Foot arch stretchers normally function through proper application of the law of physics by applying leverage as a mechanical advantage. Foot arch stretchers are generally used from a sitting position with the legs extended to the front. On most foot arch stretcher models, the user begins with a bent knee and places the front portion of the foot (including the toes) into the foot arch stretcher sleeve. Once the foot is secured in place, the user slides the foot arch stretcher forward along the floor while slowly straightening the leg. As the leg slides forward, leverage from the stretcher base increases while the foot sleeve keeps the toes in place. This, in effect, applies pressure and induces stretching of the muscles and tendons in the arch, ankle, and metatarsal areas. The straighter the leg becomes, the more intense the stretch will be.  Users  Foot arch stretchers are mainly used by ballet dancers (ballerinas) in order to aid the process of going \\"en pointe\\" or dancing on the tips of their toes. However, foot arch stretchers are also commonly used by all types of dancers (jazz dance, tap dance, modern dance, hip-hop dance, etc.) as well as gymnasts, cheerleaders, yoga practitioners, runners, swimmers, rowers, martial artists, ice skaters and other athletes looking for flexibility in the foot.  History  The commercial history of foot arch stretchers began around the turn of the 21st century. However, there are accounts of foot arch stretcher designs dating before that time. Prior to the invention of foot arch stretchers, dancers found creative ways to stretch their feet: usually placing their feet under pianos or couches, or having a partner manually force the stretch. It wasn't until the early 2000s that a few crafty dancers put their minds to work and came up with a solution. Between 2000 and 2001 foot arch stretchers first emerged in both the United States of America (with the Arch Genie) and in Europe (with the Ballet Footstretch). Since the creation and introduction of these foot arch stretchers to the market, there have been many imitation foot stretchers flooding the market.  Controversy  The safety and efficacy of using foot arch stretchers has been called into question by many dance and healthcare specialists. Most of the controversy surrounds the idea that foot stretchers weaken the muscles and tendons by forcing them into \\"pointe\\" position for long periods of time. However, most of the same sources agree that foot arch stretchers can be a valuable addition to dance training when accompanied by strengthening exercises to build up the areas of the foot that are stretched.

It was part of the 1952 United States presidential election held throughout all contemporary forty-eight states. Voters chose twenty-four representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. The Republican Party candidate, former General of the Army and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Dwight D. Eisenhower, won his birth state Texas with 53% of the vote against Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, carrying the state's 24 electoral votes. Despite losing most southern and eastern areas of the state to Stevenson, Eisenhower managed to carry Texas by a margin of 6.44 points. Eisenhower's victory in the state made him only the second Republican to carry the state during a presidential election, with the first Republican candidate being Herbert Hoover back in 1928, along with being the first presidential candidate to win over a million votes in Texas. Eisenhower nonetheless did lose Grayson County, the home of his birthplace, Denison.

(2015) Controversy Carlos Oliveira has encountered scrutiny by religious skeptics, Catholic bishops, and priests for his different independent approach to deliverance ministry and exorcism. He does not follow religious censorship, the Catholic religion, dogma, or the Catholic exorcist procedures including: prayer recitals (ex. \\"Hail Mary,\\" and the \\"Athanasian Creed\\") along with prayers to saints as enumerated in the exorcism rituals according to traditional Catholicism. Archbishop Isaac Kramer made the statement: \\"When you perform an exorcism, it involves several prayers. It involves commanding the demons. It involves holy water. It involves other things‚Ä¶ that you just cannot do through a computer screen.\\" There are others who may oppose Arch Bishop Isaac Kramer's point of view, as it may contradict Psalm 147:5King James Version Bible. \\"Psalm 147:5 KJV - Great is Our Lord, and of Great Power:.\\" Bible Gateway.

The episode was written by executive producer Danny Cannon and directed by Paul Edwards. It was first broadcast on May 9, 2016. In the episode, Azrael continues his killing spree across Gotham City while Dr. Strange tries to evade arrest for his experiments. The episode received positive reviews with critics commenting on Galavan/Azrael's fate as well as the Bridgit reveal. Plot Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie), Bullock (Donal Logue) and police officers arrive at Arkham Asylum with a warrant to inspect Professor Strange's (B. D. Wong) office. But Strange is one step ahead of them as he shredded all documents. Meanwhile, Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) is disturbed after discovering the Indian Hill labs and decides that he needs to escape. Azrael (James Frain) arrives at a church and asks the priest for a new sword, but when the priest tells him he has none, Azrael kills him. With Captain Barnes (Michael Chiklis) still in hospital, Bullock is declared de facto captain. Bruce (David Mazouz) decides to go with Selina (Camren Bicondova) to find a way to enter Arkham. Selina accepts as she realizes that her friend Bridgit may still be alive in Arkham but states that she will go alone. Gordon and Bullock visit Butch's (Drew Powell) mansion to talk with Tabitha (Jessica Lucas). Tabitha states that the sword Azrael used was fake and so, he will get the real one. The real sword lies in her grandfather's tomb. They arrive at the Gotham cemetery where they retrieve the sword. Azrael arrives and attacks them, locking the cemetery while Gordon is outside. Tabitha tries to reason with Azrael, which causes him to remember everything, including that he has to kill Bruce Wayne. Azrael thanks her and then stabs her. Gordon is able to get a police car and warns Alfred (Sean Pertwee) about Galavan while Bruce returns to Wayne Manor. While Butch visits Tabitha in the hospital, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) arrives and proposes to him that they unite to kill Azrael in revenge for Cobblepot's mother's death and Tabitha's health state. Selina infiltrates Arkham through the air ducts, where she runs into Nygma, who is trying to escape. He tells her how to get to Indian Hill so she can show him how to escape. Selina discovers the elevator that leads her to Indian Hill and overhears a conversation between Strange and Peabody (Tonya Pinkins) about Azrael. Azrael arrives at Wayne Manor and attacks Alfred. Bruce manages to knock Azrael down with a car, but he gets back up and prepares to kill Bruce. Before he can, Gordon arrives and shoots Azrael many times to no avail. When Azrael is about to kill Bruce, Gordon, and Alfred, Cobblepot arrives with Butch, who uses an AT4 anti-tank rocket to kill Azrael. Nygma manages to escape Arkham Asylum through an air duct, but he is discovered by a guard and returned to Arkham. Selina discovers a training room where she finds burned dead bodies. Bridgit (Michelle Veintimilla) arrives in a new suit and flamethrower, revealing that she suffers from amnesia and that Strange sends her test subjects. Selina fails to reason with her and attempts to escape the room, which she discovers is locked. Bridgit is not fazed by Selina's attempts to remind her of her life, stating her name is \\"Firefly\\". Bridgit then fires the flamethrower towards Selina while Strange and Peabody watch. Production =Development= In April 2016, it was announced that the twentieth episode of the season would be titled \\"Unleashed\\", and was to be written by executive producer Danny Cannon, with Paul Edwards directing. =Casting= Morena Baccarin, Erin Richards, Chris Chalk, and Nicholas D'Agosto don't appear in the episode as their respective characters.

Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"When Gotham aired its fall finale back in November, one of the biggest issues with the episode was that the crux of its dramatic tension was derived from the threat posed to Bruce Wayne by Theo Galavan. Galavan, up until that episode, had been a somewhat interesting character. His vision of total destruction in Gotham, aided by his run as Mayor of the city, brought a sense of clarity to a show that had often traded in case-of-the-week villains that boasted little staying power or genuine intrigue. Galavan felt different, like a person who could truly exploit the corrupt nature of Gothams bureaucratic, political and criminal systems. Then, Galavan went after Bruce in the fall finale because of an ancient blood feud and everything went off the rails because, spoiler alert, Bruce Wayne isn‚Äôt going to die. It's a shame that Gotham chooses to go back to the well with Galavan and Bruce because Azrael is (was?) a promising character. Last week's episode positioned him as a rather unstoppable force, only to have him fall this week at the hands of Cobblepot, Butch, and their rocket launcher. The campy fun of Butch and Cobblepot showing up to save Gordon and kill Galavan aside, the story falls flat. It's actually baffling that Gotham feels the need to not only resurrect Galavan, but to then have him once again go after Bruce Wayne. 'Unleashed' is nearly the same in structure and tone to 'Rise Of The Villains: Worse Than A Crime,' meaning that the episode just feels like a coda that nobody wanted to a resolution we already received.\\" Andy Behbakht of TV Overmind gave the series a star rating of 4 out of 5, writing \\"Overall, 'Unleashed' was a really enjoyable episode that was quite intense and has that tone that makes you really feel that we are close to wrapping up the season.\\" Keertana Sastry of EW stated: \\"For the first few seconds of Monday night's episode of Gotham, it seemed for the first time in season 2 that Gordon, Bullock ,and the GCPD had finally caught a break in their fight against the 'wrath of the villains' terrorizing the city. But as per usual, they are in way over their heads.\\" Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5.0, stating: \\"I still can't get over that Galavan ending. From the moment Jim's gun came up empty to Galavan being blown to smithereens was mind-blowing awesome. I think I could watch that scene over and over again and never get bored. I loved this episode, but I think the best is still to come!\\" The Baltimore Sun wrote positively about the episode, \\"In 'Unleashed,' we said goodbye to Gothams worst mayor and most outdated villain with the help of one of Galavan/Azrael's countless enemies. The killer shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention this season (hint: It was Penguin), but it was a satisfying, if not over-the-top, farewell for the show's most contemptible villain.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote positively about the episode, stating \\"My favorite part of 'Unleashed,' other than the unfortunate incident between Azrael and the boomlog, was that Jim Gordon was basically reduced to an afterthought and even Bruce remarked, at one point, 'I'm sick of trusting Detective Gordon!' Attaboy, Brucie. Maybe next time, Jimbo. You still have a few episodes to get it together.\\" References  External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 2) episodes Category:2016 American television episodes ","title":"Unleashed (Gotham)"},{"id":"50505305","text":"XHHU-FM is a radio station on 89.9 FM in Mart√≠nez de la Torre, Veracruz.

Among his most fundamental contributions are development of the method of invariants in band theory of solids, the Bir- Aronov-Pikus mechanism of spin relaxation of electrons, prediction of the circular photogalvanic effect, and theory of weak localization in noncentrosymmetric structures. His three monographs G. E. Pikus, Basics of the Theory of Semiconductor Devices (1965) [in Russian]G. L. Bir and G. E. Pikus, Symmetry and Strain-Induced Effects in Semiconductors (Wiley, NY, 1974)E. L. Ivchenko and G. E. Pikus. Superlattices and other heterostructures: symmetry and optical phenomena (Springer, 2012), 2nd edition. reflect the focus points of the theory of semiconductors during the second half of 20th century from transistors to band theory to properties to artificial nanostructures. Life and carrier Pikus was born in Moscow but afterwards the family moved to Minsk (currently Belorussia) where he graduated from high school. After the graduation, he became a student in the physical-engineering department of Leningrad (currently St. Petersburg) Polytechnic University in the fall of 1940. Two events overshadowed young years of his life. During the Great Terror of the late 1930s Pikus lost his family, and after the Nazi invasion of USSR in the summer 1941 Pikus volunteered to the Army which resulted in long break in his education. He fought from Leningrad to Austria and received high military honors for his service. In 1947 Pikus resumed his education in Leningrad Polytechnic University. After the graduation in 1951 he was directed for work at an electronic factory in Novosibirsk. During the Thaw that followed Stalin's death, Abram Ioffe established in Leningrad the Institute for Semiconductors and Andrey I. Anselm, a head of the Theoretical Department of the institute, managed to bring his former student Pikus back to Leningrad. This allowed Pikus to start his research that lasted for four decades. He worked in the Institute for Semiconductors, and after its merging with the A. F. Ioffe Physical Technical Institute, in the Ioffe Institute to the rest of his life. Pikus contributed to various areas of physics of semiconductors from optical spectroscopy to charge and spin transport. Distinguishing features of his style were symmetry approach to theoretical problems and close connection to experimental work. Pikis's deep feeling of the role of symmetry developed during his work with Bir on the effect of anisotropic deformations on energy spectrum and physical propertied of semiconductors, a controversial subject at that time. In the future, this approach guided prediction of the photogalvanic effect, developing of a nondissipative electric current in homogeneous gyrotropic crystals under illumination of them by circularly polarized light. It was first discovered in bulk Te, crystal with a tricky band structure, and became more recently a powerful tool in physics of nanostructures. Active experimental research on optical orientation in semiconductors performed in the Ioffe Institute attracted Pikus's attention and resulted in the Bir- Aronov-Pikus mechanism of spin relaxation and prediction of optical alignment of excitons. In the late period of his life, Pikus concentrated on developing a consistent theory of the weak localization corrections to magnetoconductivity of spin-orbit coupled media. Around Pikus grew a new generation of young theorists including such prominent researchers as Gennady Bir, Arkady Aronov, and Eugene Ivchenko. Pikus was awarded the Ioffe Prize of the Academy of Sciences (1987), USSR State Prize (1988), and the Hanle Prize of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (1993). A. F. Ioffe Institute held in 2013 an all-Russia Seminar in commemoration of Pikus's 90th birthday.

It is also the first episode of the show's fourth season, and was broadcast on 10 May 2016. The episode's story begins four months after the events of the previous episode, \\"Blood and Fire\\". \\"First Blood\\" saw the introduction of Kate Jenkinson's character Allie Novak, former prison Governor Joan (Pamela Rabe) returning as an inmate and the beginning of a rivalry between central character Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack) and Kaz Proctor (Tammy Macintosh). The episode also includes scenes set outside the prison, which follow Franky Doyle (Nicole da Silva), a former inmate who is released on parole. It was the first episode of the show to be filmed at a new rebuilt set. It has received generally positive reviews from television critics. Reviews regarding scenes in which Joan is incarcerated in a glass-walled cell were less favourable. Plot The episode begins with Franky (Nicole da Silva) giving an interview on radio about her time inside Wentworth. While Franky is doing the interview, Bea (Danielle Cormack) is watching the world go by while travelling back to Wentworth after the fire. Vera and Channing are discussing the re-built prison block. Will (Robbie Magasiva) and Vera (Kate Atkinson) are standing with other prison guards awaiting the arrival of the other prisoners from Walford. When settling back into the new block, multiple prisoners welcome Bea back with gifts and Lucy Gambaro gives Bea a shiv in the belief that Bea may need it. Then a prisoner, Allie, comes to see Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack) informing her that Kaz wanted to see Bea but is told by Maxine that Kaz would have to meet Bea. Bea has a meeting with Vera about how they can work together to help the prison. Bea requests that the prison has conjugal visits that Walford has. Bea then goes and meets with Kaz where Kaz spitefully welcomes Bea back to the prison. Kaz then gives Bea a bottle of alcohol. Franky and Bridget Westfall (Libby Tanner) have been shown to be enjoying a lot of personal time together. Although it is shown that someone is watching them. That night a van comes to Wentworth and Joan (Pamela Rabe) comes out of the van and the staff all become uneasy but Vera reassures them that it is just until her trial. The next day, the prisoners all witness Kim (Ra Chapman) scaling a barbed fence due to being on drugs. Bea is visibly disgusted. Kim has to be restrained by the prison staff on a hospital bed. Vera and Will discuss the possibility that it is meth she is on. When Bea and Maxine beat up the prisoner they believe supplied Kim the drugs, Kaz tells her gang that Bea is now the abuser. When Doreen leaves Bea alone in the showers, Allie comes in and looks at Bea naked, Bea then closes the curtain and finishes her shower. Bea walks over to Allie and confronts her. They end up having a fight in the shower when Bea pushes her into the wall. That evening, Bridget and Franky discuss the fact Joan knows about their relationship, Doreen (Shareena Clanton) gives Joshua over to Nash (Luke McKenzie) and Bea starts to cut herself. Production On 21 April 2015, Foxtel announced that the episode would be screened in May 2016. SoHo aired a special show titled \\"An Audience With the Cast of Wentworth\\" on 3 May 2016. It was designed to offer the audience an insight into the show and build anticipation for the series premiere later that month. The episode first aired on 10 May 2016 in Australia. The episode picks up four months after the events of the previous episode. A fire destroyed parts of the prison and several inmates had to be transferred to another facility until construction was completed. The episode marks a change in character dynamic as prison staff take on new roles. Vera is promoted to Governor and Will is promoted to Deputy Governor but still has a target on his back. Atkinson told Carena Crawford from All About Soap that the episode features Joan returning to the prison as an inmate. She explained that writers included \\"psychological jousting\\" between Vera and Joan that is \\"really delicious\\". \\"First Blood\\" marks the first time Vera appears to have the \\"upper hand\\" over other characters. Atkinson warned that her character gets too confident too early because it becomes apparent by the end of the episode that Joan will not make prison life easy. =Casting= The episode featured Socratis Otto and Tammy Macintosh resuming their respective roles of Maxine Conway and Kaz Proctor, making their first appearances as regular cast members. Kate Jenkinson was also introduced during \\"First Blood\\" as new inmate Allie Novak. Regular cast member Aaron Jeffery who played Matthew \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher had left the show off-screen and prior to \\"First Blood\\" airing. =Locations= It was mentioned that \\"a new and bigger filming location for the series in western Melbourne, which on-screen will appear as a new wing of the prison.\\" David Knox for TV Tonight stated \\"Now filmed at a new location in western Melbourne, and helmed by a new Series Producer in Pino Amenta, there are changes on screen and behind the scenes.\\" Reception \\"First Blood\\" was watched by 140,000 Australians according to overnight ratings regarding the original airdate. In the United Kingdom 930,000 watched the episode on Channel 5. Seneca Cabrera from The Bit Bag stated \\"Wentworth does not like to disappoint their fans when it comes to releases.

At a time when there were very few professional women photographers, her career spanned a remarkable forty years. Biography Born around 1820 (the exact date and location are unknown), Julia Ann Swift originally trained to be a teacher, earning her certificate in Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1839. By 1852, however, she was working in the Utica, New York, daguerreotype studio of Daniel DeWitt Tompkins Davie, remaining there for three years. She married sometime before 1855 and began working under the name Julia Ann Raymond. By early 1856, she had moved to Nevada City, California, where she set up her own studio in premises formerly occupied by the photographer George O. Kilbourn, which she advertised as having \\"all the latest instruments and chemicals.\\" Her studio burned down a few months after she set up shop, but she reopened down the street within a couple of months. Rudolph specialized in studio portraits, but she also took some street scenes. She printed her images as daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes that were mounted on leather or paper. In 1857, an engraving based on her ambrotype of Edward Matteson was published in Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine. For a time towards the end of 1856, she reverted to using her birth name; the date of her divorce is unknown, but in December of that year she remarried. Her second husband, James Ferdinand Rudolph, was a pharmacist, and she began using the name Julia Ann Rudolph in her business dealings. Rudolph stayed in Nevada City for four years before moving her business to K Street in Sacramento, where she pursued her career until at least 1890. A record of increasingly higher tax payments suggests that her business flourished. From 1873 on, Rudolph and her husband split their time between Sacramento and Nevada City, and Rudolph operated photographic studios in both cities for a time. In 1890, Rudolph and her husband moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she died of consumption.

Dedicated to Shiva, it houses a high lingam in its sanctum. The temple's construction is believed to have started in the 11th century, during the reign of the Paramara king Bhoja. The construction was abandoned for unknown reasons, with the architectural plans engraved on the surrounding rocks. The unfinished materials abandoned at the site, the architectural drawings carved on the rocks, and the mason's marks have helped scholars understand the temple construction techniques of 11th- century India. The temple has been designated as a Monument of National Importance by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). History The Bhojpur temple is believed to have been constructed by the 11th-century Paramara king Bhoja. Tradition also attributes to him the establishment of Bhojpur and the construction of now-breached dams in the area. Because the temple was never completed, it lacks a dedicatory inscription. However, the name of the area (\\"Bhojpur\\") corroborates its association with Bhoja. This belief is further supported by the site's sculptures, which can be dated to the 11th century with certainty. A Jain temple in Bhojpur, which shares the same sets of mason's marks with the Shiva temple, has an inscription explicitly dated to 1035 CE. Besides several literary works, historical evidence confirms that Bhoja's reign included the year 1035 CE: the Modasa copper plates (1010-11 CE) were issued by Bhoja; and the Chintamani-Sarnika (1055 CE) was composed by his court poet Dasabala. Moreover, the area around the temple once featured three dams and a reservoir. The construction of such a large Shiva temple, dams and reservoir could have only been undertaken by a powerful ruler. All this evidence appears to confirm the traditional belief that the temple was commissioned by Bhoja. Archaeology professor Kirit Mankodi dates the temple to the later part of Bhoja's reign, around mid-11th century. The Udaipur Prashasti inscription of the later Paramara rulers states that Bhoja \\"covered the earth with temples\\" dedicated to the various aspects of Shiva, including Kedareshvara, Rameshwara, Somanatha, Kala, and Rudra. Tradition also attributes the construction of a Saraswati temple to him (see Bhoj Shala). The Jain writer Merutunga, in his Prabandha-Chintamani, states that Bhoja constructed 104 temples in his capital city of Dhara alone. However, the Bhojpur temple is the only surviving shrine that can be attributed to Bhoja with some certainty. According to a legend in Merutunga's Prabandha-Chintamani, when Bhoja visited Srimala, he told the poet Magha about the \\"BhojasvƒÅmin\\" temple that he was about to build, and then left for Malwa (the region in which Bhojpur is located). However, Magha (c. 7th century) was not a contemporary of Bhoja, and therefore, the legend is anachronistic. The temple originally stood on the banks of a reservoir 18.5 long and 7.5 miles wide. This reservoir was formed through construction of 3 earth-and-stone dams during Bhoja's reign. The first dam, built on Betwa River, trapped the river waters in a depression surrounded by hills. A second dam was constructed in a gap between the hills, near present-day Mendua village. A third dam, located in present-day Bhopal, diverted more water from the smaller Kaliasot river into the Betwa dam reservoir. This man-made reservoir existed until 15th century, when Hoshang Shah emptied the lake by breaching two of the dams. =Funerary monument theory= The Bhojpur temple features several peculiar elements, including the omission of a mandapa connected to the garbhagriha (sanctum), and the rectilinear roof instead of the typical curvilinear shikhara (dome tower). Three of the temple's walls feature a plain exterior; there are some carvings on the entrance wall, but these are of the 12th century style. Based on these peculiarities, researcher Shri Krishna Deva proposed that the temple was a funerary monument. Deva's hypothesis was further corroborated by the discovery of a medieval architectural text by M. A. Dhaky. This fragmentary text describes the construction of memorial temples erected over the remains of a dead person, conceived of as vehicles for ascent to the heaven. Such temples were called svargarohana-prasada (\\"temple commemorating the ascent to the svarga or heaven\\"). The text explicitly states that in such temples, a roof of receding tiers should be used instead of the typical shikhara. Kirit Mankodi notes that the superstructure of the Bhojpur temple would have been in this exact form upon its competition. He speculates that Bhoja may have started the construction of this shrine for the peace of soul of his father Sindhuraja or of his uncle Munja, who suffered a humiliating death in enemy territory. = Abandonment of construction = Architectural drawings engraved in the surrounding rock, for use by the artisans It appears that the construction work stopped abruptly. The reasons are not known, but historians speculate that the abandonment may have been triggered by a sudden natural disaster, a lack of resources, or a war. Before its restoration during 2006‚Äì07, the building lacked a roof. Based on this, archaeologist KK Muhammed theorizes that the roof could have collapsed due to a mathematical error made while calculating the load; subsequently, circumstances might have prevented Bhoja from rebuilding it. The evidence from the abandoned site has helped the scholars understand the mechanics and organisation of 11th century temple construction. To the north and the east of the temple, there are several quarry sites, where unfinished architectural fragments in various stages of carving were found. Also present are the remains of a large sloping ramp erected for carrying the carved slabs from the quarries to the temple site. Several carvings brought to the temple site from the quarries had been left at the site. The ASI moved these carvings to a warehouse in the 20th century. Detailed architectural plans for the finished temple are engraved on the rocks in the surrounding quarries. These architectural plans indicate that the original intention was to build a massive temple complex with many more temples. The successful execution of these plans would have made Bhojpur one of the largest temple complexes in India. A statue lying down at Shiv Temple, Bhojpur.jpg  An unfinished statue at the site Palace frags PP.jpg  Architectural fragments at one of the quarry sites Bhojeshwar temple carved rock fragments.jpg  Carved rock fragments near the entrance The marks of over 1,300 masons are engraved on the temple building, the quarry rocks and two other shrines in the village. This includes the names of 50 masons engraved on the various portions of the temple structure. Other marks are in the form of various symbols such as circle, crossed circle, wheel, trident, swastika, conch shell, and Nagari script characters. These marks were meant to identify the amount of work completed by individuals, families or guilds involved in the construction. The marks would have been erased while giving the finishing touches, had the temple been completed.  Conservation and restoration  By 1950, the building had become structurally weak because of the regular rainwater percolation and removal of the stone veneers. In 1951, the site was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for conservation, in accordance with the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act 1904. During the early 1990s, the ASI repaired the damaged steps of the platform and the sanctum, and also restored the missing ones. It also restored the facade on the north-west corner of the temple. During 2006‚Äì07, the ASI team supervised by KK Muhammed carried out a restoration of the monument. The team added a missing pillar to the structure. The 12-tonne pillar was carved out of a single stone by expert masons and sculptors in a style that matches the original. The monolith was procured from the area near Agra after a nationwide search for material matching the stone originally used in the temple. The team was unable to procure a crane with a sufficiently long boom. So, they lifted the monolith 30 feet up with the help of a system of pulleys and levers, which took 6 months to devise. KK Muhammed noted that two other pillars in the temple weigh 33 tonnes, and are also carved out of a single stone: it must have been very challenging for the original builders to erect these pillars without modern technology and resources. The team closed the ceiling with a new architectural component matching the original one, to stop the water percolation. This fibreglass component weighs less than the original one, thus reducing unnecessary weight which could damage the structure. To further prevent the rainwater from getting in, the ASI also closed the portion between the wall and the superstructure by placing slanting stone slabs. In addition, the ASI placed new stone veneers matching the original ones on the northern, southern and western exterior walls of the temple. The ASI also cleaned the dirt that had accumulated on the temple walls over the past few centuries.  Architecture  The temple lies on a platform long, wide and high. On the platform lies a sanctum containing a large lingam. The sanctum plan comprises a square; on the outside, each side measures ; on the inside, each measures . The lingam is built using three superimposed limestone blocks. The lingam is high and in circumference. It is set on a square platform, whose sides measure . The total height of the lingam, including the platform is over . The doorway to the sanctum is high. The wall at the entrance features sculptures of apsaras, ganas (attendants of Shiva) and river goddesses. The temple walls are window- less and are made of large sandstone blocks. The pre-restoration walls did not have any cementing material. The northern, southern and eastern walls feature three balconies, which rest on massive brackets. These are faux balconies that are purely ornamental. They are not approachable from either inside or outside of the temple, because they are located high up on the walls, and have no openings on the interior walls. The northern wall features a makara-pranala, which provided a drainage outlet for the liquid used to bathe the lingam. Other than the sculptures on the front wall, this makara sculpture is the only carving on the external walls. 8 images of goddesses were originally placed high up on the four interior walls (two on each wall); only one of these images now remains.

A single couple appears on all the three faces of each bracket. While the superstructure remains incomplete, it is clear that the shikhara (dome tower) was not intended to be curvilinear. According to Kirit Mankodi, the shikhara was intended to be a low pyramid-shaped samvarana roof, usually featured in the mandapas. According to Adam Hardy, the shikhara probably intended to be of phamsana (rectilinear in outline) style, although it is of bhumija (Latina or curvilinear in outline) style in its detailing. The incomplete but richly carved dome is supported by four octagonal pillars, each high. Each pillar is aligned with 3 pilasters. These 4 pillars and 12 pilasters are similar to the navaranga-mandapas of some other medieval temples, in which 16 pillars were organized to make up 9 compartments. The remnants of a sloping ramp can be seen on the north-eastern corner of the building. The ramp is built of sandstone slabs, each measuring 39 x 20 x 16 inches. The slabs are covered with soil and sand. The ramp itself is long, and slopes upwards to a height of . Originally, the ramp reached up to the temple wall, but currently, a gap exists between the two. Bhojeshwar Temple Museum There is a small museum dedicated to Bhojeshwar Shiva Temple and it is situated nearly 200 meters from the main temple. The museum depicts the history of Bhojeshwar Temple through posters and sketches. The museum also describes the reign of Bhoja and important books written by him as well as the mason marks. There is no entry fee in the museum and the museum is open for visitors from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.  Present use  The monument is now under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Because of its proximity to the state capital Bhopal (28 km), it attracts a considerable number of tourists. In 2015, the site received the National Tourism Award (2013‚Äì14) for the \\"Best maintained and Disabled Friendly Monument\\". Despite being unfinished, the temple is in use for religious purposes. On Maha Shivaratri, thousands of devotees visit the temple. The Government of Madhya Pradesh organises the Bhojpur Utsav cultural event at the site every year around Maha Shivaratri. Past performers at the event include Kailash Kher, Richa Sharma, Ganna Smirnova, and Sonu Nigam.

The film was released on August 26, 2016, by Amazon Studios and IFC Films. Plot A woman is shown living a variety of different lives under different aliases in different cities. In New York City she manufactures a meeting with Clyde at a cafeteria and introduces herself as Alice, a biologist who specializes in studying frogs and who has recently returned from an extended project in Tasmania. Clyde's friend and coworker Tom is preparing for a birthday party with his wife Ramina, an aspiring jewelry designer. Since Alice says she is looking to meet new friends, he takes her to the party. There she charms Ramina and the other guests with tales of her life and work in Tasmania. When Tom returns from the party he seems to recognize her and calls her \\"Jenny\\". Ramina announces that she has been accepted into a prestigious jewelry design fellowship in California, something Tom was not yet aware of. Over dinner, Alice tells of how she had impulsively decided to live in Mexico for a year, without informing her family. The admission causes some of the dinner guests to question her life choices. Later, Tom confronts Alice, who admits to being Jenny, an old college girlfriend who disappeared. She explains that she has spent the last fifteen years living under a string of assumed identities, abandoning them and moving one whenever she begins to feel trapped. She has come to New York to see Tom, someone who knows her from her old life. The groups heads to a nightclub. Alice does a magic trick for Tom and explains that she learned it while working as a magicians assistant in China. The admission causes Clyde and the others to question her story and whether she lied about her background. Alice leaves the club and Tom follows her. They run into a woman named Nina who is walking her dog. When Nina sprains her ankle they help her back to her nearby apartment, with Alice claiming to be a pediatric surgeon. At the apartment which Nina shares with her husband Roger, Alice introduces Tom as Tony, an osteopath. At Roger's urging, Tom examines Nina. He begins to understand the thrill which Alice feels from pretending, but becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Tom asks Alice if everything she says is a lie and she assures him that she really does work with animals. She takes him to Long Island to meet her coworker and see frogs hatching. Afterwards, Tom insists on accompanying her to her apartment as she prepares to leave and assume a new identity. Alice invites Tom to come with her, but he refuses. He returns to his apartment to discuss California with his wife. In a public restroom, Alice dumps her credit cards, but keeps her drivers license, which she puts in a scrapbook containing all her old identities. She walks off into the crowd but then reappears in frame, wearing different clothes and a new identity.

Locomotion in these conditions is different from locomotion in Earth's gravity. There are many factors that contribute to these differences, and they are crucial when researching long-term survival of humans in space.  Challenges of locomotion in reduced gravity  Humans have long lived in a 1-G environment and have therefore become accustomed to Earth's standard atmospheric conditions, and the microgravity environment of space can have huge effects on the human body and its locomotion (Main article: Space medicine). = Environmental conditions = The environmental conditions in space are harsh and require extensive equipment for survival and completion of daily activities. There are many environmental factors to consider both inside and outside of a spacecraft that astronauts work in. These factors include but are not limited to movement during weightlessness, general equipment necessary to travel to the desired destination in space, and gear such as space suits that hinder mobility.Harris, G., & American Astronautical Society.

When doing extravehicular activities (EVA), it is important to be protected from the vacuum of space.Mallan, L. (1971). Suiting up for space; the evolution of the space suit. New York: John Day. Exposure to this harsh environment can cause death in a small amount of time. The main environmental factors of concern in space include but are not limited to the following (Main article: Space Exposure): * lack of oxygen * extreme pressure and temperature differences * higher radiation levels (Main article: Health Threat from Cosmic Rays) = Effects on the human body = There are many detrimental effects of extended exposure to reduced gravity that are similar to aging and disease. Some long-duration effects of reduced gravity can be simulated on Earth using bed rest. These effects are discussed below in general but more detailed information can be found on the page \\"Effect of spaceflight on the human body.\\" The various effects include: * muscle atrophy * deconditioning (e.g. arterial constriction, bone density loss ) * symptoms similar to aging or disease * head-ward fluid shifts (headaches, sinus/nasal congestion, facial swelling) * decreased muscle volume * decreased bone strength and fracture * increased fatigue and loss of general strength * decreased locomotor control * motion sickness * vision problems * excessive flatulence * other physical effects * psychological effects The muscle volume can decrease up to 20% over a six-month mission, and the bone density can decrease at a rate of approximately 1.4% at the hip in a month's time. A study done by Fitts and Trappe examined the effects of prolonged space flight (defined as approximately 180 days) on human skeletal muscle using muscle biopsies. Prolonged weightlessness was shown to cause significant loss in the mass, force, and power production in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. Many countermeasures to these effects exist, but thus far they are not sufficient to compensate for the detrimental effects of space travel and astronauts need extensive rehabilitation upon their return to Earth.  Technology used to compensate for the negative effects  In order to compensate for the negative effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity, scientists have developed many countermeasure technologies with varying degrees of success. Electrical Muscle stimulation NMES for back. = Electrical stimulation = Transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is the use of electric current to stimulate muscle activity. This method is theoretically utilized to prevent muscle atrophy and weakness. The efficacy of this approach was tested in a 30-day bed rest study done by Duovoisin in 1989. Though the patients showed decreased rates of muscle atrophy in the stimulated limb, there was not evidence to support that this method would necessarily prevent these effects. More recently, in 2003, Yoshida et al. did a study related to hind limb suspension in rats. This study concluded that the hind limb suspension and EMS did have some success in the prevention of muscle function deterioration induced by disuse. There have been several scientific studies conducted that mention the application of this technique as a countermeasure in long-term spaceflight. = Loading suits = Loading suits are garments that are used to help maintain loading on the bones during their time in space, not to be confused with space suits, which aid astronauts in surviving the harsh climate outside of a vehicle such as the International Space Station (ISS). Expedition 43 commander and NASA astronaut Terry Virts shows off a special suit for his preparation process to return to Earth later. Virts tweeted this image with an explanation of the suits purpose on May 12, 2015: \\"Our \\"Penguin (–ø–∏–Ω–≥–≤–∏–Ω)\\" suit- it compresses you, to get your body ready for the return to gravity\\".  Pingvin suit  The Pingvin suit is designed to add musculoskeletal loads to specific muscle groups during space flight in order to prevent atrophy of the muscles in the back. This lightweight suit has a series of elastic bands to create these vertical bodily loads. It loads both the upper and lower body separately. The upper body can be loaded up to 88 lb. (40 kg). Users have found this suit to be hot and uncomfortable, despite its low weight.  Gravity Loading Countermeasure Skinsuit (GLCS)  The GLCS is a garment designed to help mitigate the effects of musculoskeletal deconditioning. It is partly inspired by the Pingvin suit,D.S.F. Portree (March 1995). \\"Mir Hardware Heritage\\" (PDF). NASA. p. 69. Retrieved 2016-04-17. a Russian space suit used since the 1970s. Employing elastic materials to place loads on the body, the GLCS attempts to mimic the gravitational loads experienced while standing.Kendrick, D. P. and D. J. Newman (2014). Modeling the Gravity Loading Countermeaure Skinsuit, 44th International Conference on Environmental Systems. A pilot study was conducted in parabolic flight in order to assess the viability of the initial design in 2009. This skinsuit creates a loading gradient across the body that gradually increases the loading to body weight at the feet. Further iterations of the initial design have been developed and now the current version of the suit is being tested on the ISS as part of a research project sponsored by the ESA.  Other loading suits  * DYNASUIT concept The DYNASUIT is a conceptual design that involves a suit that can be divided into many subsystems. Each subsytem controls a different aspect of the suit. For example, there is a bio- parameter subsystem that would measure physiological responses like muscle signals (EMG), heart rate, electrocardiogram, ventilation rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. There is also a central control unit or the equivalent of the suit's brain, as well as an artificial muscle subsystem that proposes to use either electro-active polymers (EAP) or pneumatics to apply forces on the body. There is also a proposed user interface to help the astronaut interact with the suit. This potential design is still in the development phase and has not been prototyped at this point. = Pharmacologic therapy = In general, the way a person's body absorbs medicine in reduced gravity conditions is significantly different than normal absorption properties here on Earth. In addition, there are various pharmacological or drug therapies that are used to counter certain side effects of prolonged space flight. For example, dextroamphetamine has been used by NASA to help with space motion sickness and orthostatic intolerance. The use of biophosphate alendronate has been proposed to aid in the prevention of bone loss but no conclusive evidence has been found to show that it helps in this regard. See recommended reading for more information on space pharmacology. = Artificial gravity = Artificial gravity (AG) is the increase or decrease of gravitational force on an object or person by artificial means. Different types of forces, including linear acceleration and centripetal force, can be used to generate this artificial gravitational force. The use of artificial gravity to counteract simulated microgravity (e.g. bed rest) on Earth has been shown to have conflicting results for the maintenance of bone, muscle, and cardiovascular systems. Short arm centrifuges can be used to generate loading conditions greater than gravity that could help prevent the skeletal muscle and bone loss associated with prolonged spaceflight and bedrest. A pilot study done by Caiozzo and Haddad in 2008 compared two groups of subjects: one that had been on bed rest of 21 days (in order to simulate the effects of prolonged space travel), and another that had been on bed rest as well as being exposed to artificial gravity for one hour a day. They used a short arm centrifuge to artificially induce the gravitational force. After taking muscle biopsy samples, they determined that the group that had been exposed to artificial gravity did not show as severe a deficit in terms of muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Even though this technology has potential to aid in counteracting the detrimental effects of prolonged spaceflight, there are difficulties in applying these artificial gravity systems in space. Rotating the whole spacecraft is expensive and introduces another layer of complexity to the design. A smaller centrifuge can be used to provide intermittent exposure, but the available exercise activities in the small centrifuge are limited due to the high rotation speed required to generate adequate artificial gravitational forces. The subject can experience \\"unpleasant vestibular and Coriolis effects\\" while in the centrifuge. Several studies have suggested that artificial gravity might be an adequate countermeasure for prolonged space flight, especially if combined with other countermeasures. A conceptual design entitled ViGAR (Virtual Gravity Artificial Reality) was proposed in 2005 by Kobrick et al. and it details a device that combines artificial gravity, exercise and virtual reality to counter the negative effects of prolonged spaceflight. It includes a bicycle on a centrifuge as well as an integrated virtual reality system. = Exercise methods = Astronaut Sunita L. Williams, Expedition 14 flight engineer, equipped with a bungee harness, exercises on the Treadmill Vibration Isolation System (TVIS) in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station.  Treadmill Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (TVIS)  The TVIS is a modified treadmill. It includes a vibration isolation system, which prevents the forces from the exercise from being transferred into the International Space Station (ISS). This device is used in a very similar manner to a regular treadmill. In order to hold the user to the surface of the treadmill, it includes a system of straps called the series bungee system (SBS) which use latex tubes or straps called \\"subject load devices\\" (SLDs) attached to a harness. These straps place resistive forces and loads in a range of 40 lb. to 220 lb. on the crew member's body as they walk or run on the treadmill.  Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation (CEVIS)  NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, Expedition 32 flight engineer, exercises on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS) in the Destiny laboratory of the International Space Station The CEVIS provides both aerobic and cardiovascular training using recumbent cycling activities. The workload placed on the subject can be tuned very accurately. You can create target goals of speed, workload and heart rate. It is a modified version of the Inertial Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (IVIS) Cycle Ergometer. It has a control panel that displays the target workload as well as the actual workload in addition to the cycling speed, heart rate, deviation from target speed and heart rate, and elapsed exercise time. The workload range is between 25 and 350 Watts. The pedal speeds range from 30 to 120 rpm. There is a vibration isolation system that prevents the motions and forces generated by the crew member exercising from being transferred to the International Space Station (ISS). It is currently used on the International Space Station as part of the astronauts' weekly exercise schedule and it is certified for 15 years of on-orbit service.  Interim Resistance Exercise Device (iRED)  SS017E006639 (11 May 2008) - NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman, Expedition 17 flight engineer, wearing squat harness pads, performs knee-bends using the Interim Resistive Exercise Device (IRED) equipment in the Unity node of the International Space Station. The iRED provides resistive exercise to the user which helps prevent muscle atrophy and minimize bone loss. It focuses on maintaining the strength, power, and endurance of the crew member. It has over 18 different exercises for both upper and lower body and provides up to a 300 lb. resistive force. Examples of possible exercises include but are not limited to: squats, straight-leg deadlifts, bent-leg deadlifts, heel raises, bend-over rows, upright rows, bicep curls, shoulder presses etc. It was used daily as a part of the crew members' exercise regimen but was retired in October 2011. Now, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) is used.  Other exercise methods for use in space  * Flywheel exercise device * Multi-purpose Integrated Countermeasures Stimulator (M-ICS) * Resistive Vibration Exercise * Integrated Countermeasure and Rehabilitation Exerciser (ICARE) * Short Arm Human Centrifuge * Lower Body Negative Pressure Exercise (LBNP)  Effectiveness and assessment of these methods  The TVIS and iRED are largely ineffective when it comes to maintaining muscle volume and bone density. Both the TVIS and the iRED cannot generate forces that are similar to those experienced on Earth. The harnesses and bungee cords used in many of these device cause substantial discomfort, and in the future need to be redesigned for ease of long-duration use. The CEVIS, at its maximal setting, is the only device that can achieve resistive loads that are comparable to Earth. The European Space Agency employs many different devices to assess the effectiveness of different countermeasure technologies: * Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES) * Portable Pulmonary Function System (PPFS) * Earlobe Arterialised Blood Collector (EAB C) * Long-Term Medical Survey System (LTMS) * ISS- compatible X-Ray Imaging System * Biofeedback and Virtual-reality systems: Enhanced Virtual-Reality System (eVRS) Center of mass on a massless leg travelling along the trunk trajectory path in inverted pendulum theory. Velocity vectors are shown perpendicular to the ground reaction force at time 1 and time 2.  Kinematics of locomotion in space  See also: Bipedalism, Walking, and Gait analysis Gravity has a large influence on walking speed, muscle activity patterns, gait transitions and the mechanics of locomotion, which means that the kinematics of locomotion in space need to be studied in order to optimize movements in that environment. On Earth, the dynamic similarity hypothesis is used to compare gaits between people of different heights and weights. This hypothesis states that different mammals move in a dynamically similar manner when traveling at a speed where they have the same ratio of inertial forces to gravitational forces. This ratio is called the Froude number and is a dimensionless parameter that allows the gait of different sizes and species of animals to be compared. The Froude number is based on the mass of the person, the leg length, the person's velocity and the gravitational acceleration.Jacquelin Perry (1992). Gait Analysis: Normal and Pathological Function.Thorofare, New Jersey: SLACK Incorporated. . It indicates the point at which a person switches from walking to running and is typically around 0.5 for humans in Earth's gravity. At reduced levels of gravity, individuals switch to running at slower speeds, but still at approximately the same Froude number.Kram, R., Domingo, A., & Ferris, D. (1997). Effect of reduced gravity on the preferred walk-run transition speed. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 200(Pt 4), 821-6. When locomotion is studied in space, these same relations do not always apply. For example, the inverted pendulum model for walking might not be applicable in reduced gravity conditions. In addition, when using a space suit, there are very apparent differences in the Froude number.Xiu, W., & Ma, Ou. (2015). Study of Human Dynamics in Simulated Reduced-G Environment and Its Applications,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Christopher Carr and Jeremy McGee at MIT developed a modified parameter called the Apollo number in 2009. The Apollo number takes into account the weight that the space suit supports as well as the difference in gravitational acceleration. While it does not explain all of the differences between walking in a space suit versus without, it accounts for 60% of that difference, and has the potential to provide valuable information for optimization of future space suit designs.  Energetics of locomotion in space  See also: Space suit, Bioenergetic systems On Earth, it takes half of the amount of energy to walk a mile when compared to running the same distance. In contrast, when using a spacesuit under reduced gravity conditions, running is more efficient than walking. Generally, walking in reduced gravity has a high metabolic cost which means that there is some disruption of normal gait kinematics while in this environment. While running in reduced gravity conditions, the energy consumption of the human body decreases proportionally as body weight decreases. This combined with other evidence indicates that space suits behave similarly to springs while running, which in turn would decrease the cost of transport when compared to walking. A study by Christopher Carr and Dava Newman suggested that the cause of this spring-like behavior is knee torque, which means in motions that require a larger bend in the knee, the contributions from the space suit will be greater. The limitations on extravehicular activity (EVA) in space are related to the metabolic costs of locomotion in a spacesuit. Metabolic cost refers to the energy cost of a physical activity. Looking forward to future space missions and colonization, EVA limitations are important to consider. The aspects that play the greatest role in the energetic cost of movement in a spacesuit are the \\"suit pressurization, gravity, velocity, surface slope, and space suit configuration.

It is transmitted by mosquitoes in the genus Aedes including A. caballus and A. circumluteolus. __TOC__  History  The first known outbreak was reported in 1955 on a sheep farm in the town of Wesselsbrons in Orange Free State Province, South Africa after an increase of lamb deaths and ewe abortions. alt=Wesselsbron is located in Free State (South African province) Since the flock had been vaccinated 2 weeks before for protection against the Rift Valley virus, the possibility of a \\"new\\" disease was not put into consideration; the vaccine was assumed to be the culprit. Although they both share similarities, the WSL virus was isolated as distinct from the Rift Valley virus after the examination of a dead lamb's liver and brain.  Geographical Distribution  Since 1955, WSL virus has been found in animals and mosquitos from Zimbabwe, Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Senegal, Cameroon, and Ivory Coast. Serologic evidence has also shown the virus to be present in Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, Angola, and Madagascar. Outside of Africa, WSL virus has been found in Thailand.  Effect on Sheep  Although it can infect a wide variety of animals, WSL virus is most commonly found in sheep. In newborn lambs, death may occur within 72 hours following an incubation period of 1‚Äì3 days. Signs of illness, which include but are not limited to fever, anorexia, listlessness, weakness, and increased respiration, can often go undetected because they are not specific to any disease. Pregnant ewes generally suffer from abortions, but rams and non-pregnant ewes usually only develop a fever. There is no specific treatment for the virus, but sheep can be immunized with an attenuated vaccine that lasts a lifetime.  Human Cases  Most documented human infections have been acquired by field workers bitten by mosquitoes or in the laboratory. Person-to-Person transmission of the virus has yet to be reported, so it is not considered to be contagious in humans. The WSL virus has an incubation period of 2‚Äì4 days before leading to a sudden onset of a generally mild, acute phase that includes fever, rigors, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and impaired vision.

Like emotional quotient (EQ), FQ derived its name from IQ (intelligence quotient).  Measurement  A widely adopted measurement of FQ is based on a six- category model developed by Yu and Zhang.Yu, Cindy and Zhang, Hong (2016). \\"Financial Intelligence for Parents and Children (FIFPAC): Financial Intelligence Quotient (FQ) Test\\", Institute of Financial Intelligence, . The six categories are, * Spending * Credit and debt * Career and income * Investing * Financial planning * Risk and protection The concept of this test is based on the following understanding: * People's financial well beings are the consequences of large and small financial decisions. * A more comprehensive understanding will help improve financial behaviorsAtkinson, A. and F. Messy (2012), \\"Measuring Financial Literacy: Results of the OECD / International Network on Financial Education (INFE) Pilot Study\\", OECD Working Papers on Finance, Insurance and Private Pensions, No. 15, OECD Publishing, Paris. given the same other conditions such as the background information, personal finance and intelligence level, etc. * A higher FQ score can be obtained through education. A comprehensive FQ test includes all six categories while each category further contains multiple subjects. Test scores are obtained from each category and compiled to show the strength and weakness on each of them. A hexagon distribution of the category scores is used to provide a visualization of the FQ score. Although the term FQ is named after IQ, the FQ score is different from an IQ score, which uses a normal distribution. On the other hand, the FQ score is an indicator of how confident one can expect when the person is making a financial decision. It is based on the person's understanding of how the money works and how to conserve and grow one's wealth with a calculated risk.  Application  The FQ score has been used to analyze people's behavior in the financial world, such as using credit cards, purchasing cars and houses, etc. It is also used to measure and improve financial literacy education \\"Advancing National Strategies for Financial Education: A Joint Publication by Russia‚Äôs G20 Presidency and the OECD\\", 2013.

History  During the autumn of 1931, the \\"Manifesto of the 30\\" was published by militants of the anarchist trade union Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Among those who signed it there was the CNT General Secretary (1922‚Äì1923) Joan Peiro, Angel Pesta√±a (CNT General Secretary in 1929) and Juan Lopez Sanchez. They were called treintismo and they were calling for a more moderate political line within the Spanish anarchist movement. In 1932, they established the Syndicalist Party which participated in the 1936 Spanish general election and proceed to be a part of the leftist coalition of parties known as the Popular Front by obtaining two congressmen (Pesta√±a and Benito Pabon). In 1938, CNT General Secretary Horacio Prieto proposed that the Iberian Anarchist Federation transforms itself into a Libertarian Socialist Party and that it participates in the national elections.Isra√´l Renof, Possibilisme libertaire, Noir et Rouge, n¬∞41, mai 1968, pp. 16-23, lire en ligne. = Precedents and later cases = Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ran for the French Constituent Assembly in April 1848, but he was not elected, although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan√ßon and Lille.

For prominent anarcho-syndicalist Rudolf Rocker: \\"The first movement of the Spanish workers was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pi y Margall, leader of the Spanish Federalists and disciple of Proudhon. Pi y Margall was one of the outstanding theorists of his time and had a powerful influence on the development of libertarian ideas in Spain. His political ideas had much in common with those of Richard Price, Joseph Priestly [sic], Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a Socialist economic order\\".\\"Anarchosyndicalism\\" by Rudolf Rocker Pi i Margall was a dedicated theorist in his own right, especially through book- length works such as La reacci√≥n y la revoluci√≥n (Reaction and Revolution, 1855), Las nacionalidades (Nationalities, 1877) and La Federaci√≥n (The Federation, 1880). On the other hand, Ferm√≠n Salvochea was a mayor of the city of C√°diz and a president of the province of C√°diz. He was one of the main propagators of anarchist thought in that area in the late 19th century and is considered to be \\"perhaps the most beloved figure in the Spanish Anarchist movement of the 19th century\\".Bookchin, Murray (1998).

In doing so, she became the first woman in Spanish history to be a cabinet minister. When the Republican forces lost the Spanish Civil War, the city of Madrid was turned over to the Francoist forces in 1939 by the last non- Francoist mayor of the city, anarchist Melchor Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a.\\"S√≠ se ha aprobado por unanimidad, tambi√©n a propuesta de Ciudadanos, dedicar una calle al anarquista Melchor Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a, el √∫ltimo alcalde de Madrid republicano, ante \\"el gran consenso social y pol√≠tico\\" al respecto y por \\"su gran relevancia para la reconciliaci√≥n y la concordia tras la Guerra Civil\\".

The new decision making process was founded on unanimity as each person has a right of veto on the orientations of the federation. The FCL published the same year the Manifeste du communisme libertaire. Several groups quit the FCL in December 1955, disagreeing with the decision to present \\"revolutionary candidates\\" to the legislative elections. On 15‚Äì20 August 1954, the Ve intercontinental plenum of the CNT took place. A group called Entente anarchiste appeared which was formed of militants who did not like the new ideological orientation that the OPB was giving the FCL, seeing it was authoritarian and almost Marxist.\\"Si la critique de la d√©viation autoritaire de la FA est le principal fait de ralliement, on peut ressentir d√®s le premier num√©ro un √©tat d'esprit qui va longtemps coller √† la peau des anarchistes fran√ßais. Cet √©tat d'esprit se caract√©rise ainsi sous une double forme : d'une part un rejet inconditionnel de l'ennemi marxiste, d'autre part des questions sur le r√¥le des anciens et de l'√©volution id√©ologique de l'anarchisme. C'est Fernand Robert qui attaque le premier : \\"Le LIB est devenu un journal marxiste. En continuant √† le soutenir, tout en reconnaissant qu'il ne nous pla√Æt pas, vous fa√Ætes une mauvaise action contre votre id√©al anarchiste. Vous donnez la main √† vos ennemis dans la pens√©e. M√™me si la FA dispara√Æt, m√™me si le LIB dispara√Æt, l'anarchie y gagnera. Le marxisme ne repr√©sente plus rien. Il faut le mettre bas ; je pense la m√™me chose des dirigeants actuels de la FA. L'ennemi se glisse partout.\\" C√©dric Gu√©rin. \\"Pens√©e et action des anarchistes en France : 1950‚Äì1970\\" The FCL lasted until 1956 just after it participated in state legislative elections with tem candidates. This move alienated some members of the FCL and thus produced the end of the organization.

Tuchman, an American historian and author. It was published on March 19, 1984, by Knopf in New York.  Summary  The book is about \\"one of the most compelling paradoxes of history: the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interests.\\" It details four major instances of government folly in human history: the Trojans' decision to move the Greek horse into their city, the failure of the Renaissance popes to address the factors that would lead to the Protestant Reformation in the early sixteenth century, England's policies relating to American colonies under King George III, and the United States' mishandling of the conflict in Vietnam. More than half of the book deals with US intervention in the Vietnam War, while the other three case studies are shorter.  Critical reception  The book was described by Foreign Affairs as \\"in the Tuchman tradition: readable, entertaining, intelligent. It should lead a wide audience to think usefully about \\"the persistence of error.\\"\\" The New York Review of Books reacted favorably to the book, stating: \\"Systems and theories therefore should not be imposed on the past. The facts of the past should be allowed to speak for themselves. Why did history have to teach lessons anyway? ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù she asked with some exasperation, ‚Äúcannot history be studied and written and read for its own sake, as the record of human behavior‚Ä¶?‚Äù History is not a science, it is an art. History needs writers, or artists, who can communicate the past to readers, and that has been Tuchman‚Äôs calling.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote in a Feb 15, 1984 review, \\"An exercise in historical interpretation such as this, tracing a single idea through a set of examples, is structured toward [Tuchman's] weaknesses; and they are only too apparent. Tuchman applies the concept of folly to 'historical mistakes' with certain features in common: the policy taken was contrary to self-interest; it was not that of an individual (attributable to the individual's character), but that of a group; it was not the only policy available; and it was pursued despite forebodings that it was mistaken. The only way to account for such self-destructive policies, in Tuchman's view, is to label them follies; but that, as she seems unaware, puts them beyond rational explanation.\\" In a May 1984 review in The New Criterion, Paul Johnson criticized the book as having followed \\"the conventional, not to say threadbare, lines which the liberal media developed in the 1970s: that American involvement in Vietnam was, ab initio, an error which compounded itself as it increased and was certain to fail all along. [Tuchman] thereby falls into a trap which a historian who seeks to draw lessons from the past should be particularly careful to avoid: to assume that what in the end did happen, had to happen.\\" In The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote, \\"[A]ny way one approaches The March of Folly, it is unsatisfying, to say the least. Better books have been written about Vietnam, the American Revolution, the Renaissance Popes and the Trojan Horse.\\" He concluded, \\"Not only has [Tuchman] confined herself to the shallower wellsprings of history, she has committed the further sin of treating them superficially.\\" The book was also reviewed by History Today.

The novel is La Guma's second, and is not heavily reviewed by critics. The novel is set in the Cape Flats, an impoverished area near Cape Town. The novel follows an unemployed protagonist, thematically exploring the opportunity for solidarity amongst the oppressed peoples in the apartheid regime, making the book a critique of apartheid South Africa. Many critiques highlight the novels effective social history and social commentary: the novel represents economic conditions true to the Western Cape during the 60s, where housing shortages effected a number of displaced workers. Other critics emphasize the strong imagery and writing that make the novel engaging. La Guma wrote the novel while under arrest at Roeland Street, writing between 1962 and 1963. It was the only novel by La Guma not to appear in the highly influential African Writers Series published by Heinemann.

Early life and education Calderwood was born in 1896 in Blairgowrie, Perthshire, in Scotland. Her father Daniel Scott Calderwood was the headmaster of the Blairgowrie Public School. Her family then moved to Edinburgh when she was still young, after her father was appointed as the headmaster of the Church of Scotland Normal School. Calderwood started at James Gillespie's School in 1901, at the age of five, staying for six years. On receiving a bursary from the Edinburgh Burgh Committee on Secondary Education, she studied at Edinburgh Ladies' College from 1907 to 1914. In 1910, at the age of 14, she passed Higher Piano, and in 1913 was named the dux of the music classes at Edinburgh Ladies' College. She was also awarded the prize to the best Science scholar and best Arithmetician, both of which she resigned, and the Costorphine Prize for the best mathematician. Calderwood studied at the University of Edinburgh from 1914 to 1920, earning a Bachelor of Science (Pure) in 1919 and a Master of Arts in Political Economy in 1920. Courses taken include mathematics, Latin, natural philosophy and chemistry. She joined the faculty of the University of Birmingham the following year, lecturing in mathematics. Soon, however, she returned to Edinburgh to continue her studies under mathematician Alexander Aitken, earning a PhD in mathematics from the University in 1931 with a thesis on Researches in the Theory of Matrices. Career and research Calderwood was a member of Edinburgh Mathematical Society joined in 1919 as an undergraduate, and the London Mathematical Society, joined in 1922. She is fondly listed by a student, Margaret Lee n√©e Ireland (1962 BSc Mathematics) as one of her favourite memories: \\"Dr Nora Calderwood - what a woman who loved us so much, she could barely keep exam questions secret\\". =Awards and honours= Hers is the namesake for the Calderwood Prize, an academic award at the University of Birmingham.

Vernon was established as South Bentonsport in 1837. It received its present name with the establishment of a post office in 1852. Citizens began the process of establishing a public school in May 1866. They acquired the land in January of the following year. Riley Cass, who was probably a local builder, provided the plans for the building and was chosen to oversee its construction. The design itself was more than likely from a pattern book. Construction proceeded slowly as funds became available. Although it was substantially completed earlier, as late as 1873 the school board was still hiring workers to do finishing work. The two-story, brick Italianate building features a low pitch roof, bracketed eaves, a square bell tower, and a fanlight over the main entrance. School district consolidation began in Van Buren County in 1957 and culminated two years later with the creation of three districts. The Vernon School held its last classes in 1960. The building, which had always been used as a community center was a polling place until 1984. It is the only 19th-century brick public school building left in the county. The former school building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Ruins of World War II Constructed during World War II, the Tedim road passes through this village, and it connects the Indian city of Imphal and the Burmese town of Tedim. A contingent of the Japanese army took this road which was then still under construction. So, the Allied Forces destroyed some bridges on the Tedim road in order to check the advance of the Japanese troops.

For a number of decades, a brisk border trade has been carried out unofficially at this border village. Despite its potential, this bazaar village still lacks the infrastructure to develop into a booming commercial town. Aimed at boosting the Indo-Myanmar border trade, the Central Government of India had approved the setting up of an Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Behiang on 27 May 2012. On October 3, 2012, the State's Minister of Commerce and Industry, Konthoujam Govindas and the MLA of Singngat, GS Haupu accompanied by officials visited Behiang to ascertain land availability for the construction of the proposed Border Trade Center which is also part of the Union Government's Look East Policy.

It is commonly used for analysis of compounds where UV detection might be a restriction and therefore used where compounds do not efficiently absorb UV radiation, such as sugars, antivirals, antibiotics, fatty acids, lipids, oils, phospholipids, polymers, surfactants, terpenoids and triglycerides. ELSDs is related to the charged aerosol detector (CAD) and like the CAD, falls under the category of destructive detectors. An evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) is able to detect all compound which are less volatile than the mobile phase, i.e. non volatile and semi-volatile compounds. Principles of operation ELSDs analyze solvent after elution from HPLC. As the eluent passes from an HPLC, it is mixed with an inert carrier gas and forced through a nebulizer, which separates the liquid into minute aerosolized droplets. These droplets then pass into a heated drift tube, where the mobile phase solvent is evaporated off. As the mobile phase evaporates, the droplets become smaller and smaller until all that is left is minute particles of dried analyte. These particles are pushed through the drift tube by the carrier gas to the detection region. In this region, a beam of light crosses the column of analyte and the scattering of light is measured by a photodiode or photomultiplier tube. The detector's output is non-linear across more than one order of magnitude and proper calibration is required for quantitative analysis.

She is recognized for her unique aesthetic as well as for her pioneering use of digital marketing and social media within contemporary ceramics. She is curator of the popular Instagram feed Pots in Action and is a 2015 United States Artist Distinguished Fellow in Craft.

She worked with her hands from an early age and continues to find inspiration in Maine's people, landscape, architecture, objects and history of craft. Before studying ceramics, Horie worked as a documentary photographer, shooting for weekly newspapers in Seattle. She sees a connection between her photographs of everyday life and her conceptual and formal interests as a potter. Horie holds a BA from Mount Holyoke College, a BFA in ceramics from the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University and a MFA in ceramics from the University of Washington in Seattle. Work Horie is known for her functional pots, often featuring drawings of animals, made using a waterless throwing technique that preserves the gestural quality of clay. This \\"dry throwing\\" technique, developed while an undergraduate at Alfred, records evidence of the history of each pot's making. Fingerprints and imperfections inherent in clay such as stretching, cracking, and sagging create a sense of vulnerability and emotional connection to the user.Raccoon Jar, 2015, Porcelain, 7 x 5 x 5 in. The hand-scratched sgraffito animal drawings on her pots are inspired equally by natural history illustrations and Japanese manga. The \\"cuteness\\" of these images, heightened by the bold and playful use of color, is a way of further eliciting a sense of softness and humanity. In addition to her studio practice, Horie works collaboratively on projects that consider the relationship between ceramics and the wider community. Horie's work is in various collections throughout the United States, including the Museum of Art and Design, New York. Her solo and two-person exhibitions include Greenwich House Pottery, New York; Red Lodge Clay Center, Red Lodge Clay Center, MT; Akar Gallery, Iowa City, IA; Formargruppen, Malmo, Sweden; Lux Center for the Arts, Lincoln, NE; Kobo, Seattle, WA; Lill Street, Chicago; and Northern Clay Center, Minneapolis, MN. Her work has been featured in T: The New York Times Style Magazine online edition, Design Sponge, Ceramics Monthly, Uppercase Magazine, Studio Potter, American Craft Magazine online edition, and others. Community engagement For Horie, pots not only create intimacy between individuals but can deepen connections to community and become agents of social change. She is the curator of the Instagram feed Pots in Action, one of the first crowdsourced projects in ceramics, featuring contributions and guest hosts from around the world. The project evolved from a personal website begun in 2005, in which she collected photographs of her pots in use in daily life and plotted them on a Google Map. Horie has co- organized multiple online craft-based fundraisers, beginning with Obamaware in 2008 which was the first online fundraiser of its kind and gained unprecedented response beyond the usual ceramic audience. This was followed by Handmade For Japan in 2011, which raised over $100,000 for disaster relief following the great East Japan earthquake and tsunami. Understanding handcraft to be a political choice that celebrates individual creativity within a society based on mass consumerism, Horie works to expand the audience for functional pottery and to showcase clay as a medium that uniquely reflects everyday human experience. Since 2002, she has participated in the Artstream Nomadic Gallery, a restored 1967 Airstream trailer that operates as a mobile alternative exhibition space and has traveled to over 150 locations. In 2009, she collaborated on a tile mapping installation at Greenwich House Pottery, which used data from the Mannahatta Project to raise ecological awareness. Begun in 2015, Portland Brick is a collaborative public art project that repairs the sidewalks of Portland, Maine with bricks made from local clay that are stamped with the city's histories, memories, and wishes for the future and invites further participation through live events and a website. Horie travels widely to lecture and give workshops on ceramics and social media, including at Alfred University, Anderson Ranch, Arizona State University, Archie Bray Foundation, Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, Penland School of Crafts, Penn State University, Pratt Institute, the Rhode Island School of Design, and Virginia Commonwealth University, and was Clay Coordinator for three years at Women's Studio Workshop. She has served on multiple boards including that of the Archie Bray Foundation, the American Craft Council and accessCeramics.org.

The variety is a genetic crossbreed of the Seibel 7053 and Riesling clone 239 grape varieties. Hibernal has had plant variety protection since 1977 and was included on the list of varieties in 1999. Hibernal was developed for the same reasons as other new varieties developed by the Geisenheim Institute, such as Ehrenbreitsteiner, Dakapo, Rondo and Saphira. The basic idea was to develop pest and fungus-resistant vines. In bad years Hibernal is susceptible to mildew (powdery mildew and downy mildew) and must be provided with 1-2 sulphur treatments shortly before and/or shortly after flowering. The variety, however, has a very good winter hardiness even against stronger frosts. The full-bodied and racy wine produced has a taste at times similar to a Scheurebe. The variety is particularly important in South East Europe.

Education  When he was 19 Zayner worked at Motorola as a programmer. He has a BA in plant biology from Southern Illinois University and a Ph.D in biophysics (2013) from the University of Chicago. Before receiving his PhD he earned an MSc in cell and molecular biology from Appalachian State University.  Career  He spent two years as a researcher at the Mountain View, California's NASA Ames Space Synthetic Biology Research Center, where he worked on Martian colony habitat design. While at the agency, Zayner also analyzed speech patterns in online chat, Twitter, and books, and found that language on Twitter and online chat is closer to how people talk than to how they write. Zayner found NASA's scientific work less innovative than he expected, and upon leaving in January 2016, he launched a crowdfunding campaign to provide CRISPR kits to let the general public experiment with editing bacterial DNA. He also continued his grad school business, The ODIN, which sells kits to let the general public experiment at home. The company's main adviser is George Church, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and director of PersonalGenomes.org. As of May 2016, The ODIN had four employees and operated out of Zayner's garage. The Chromochord He refers to himself as a biohacker and believes in the importance of letting the general public participate in scientific experimentation, rather than leaving it segregated to labs. Zayner found the academic biohacking community to be exclusive and hierarchical, particularly with respect to the types of people who decide what is \\"safe\\". He hopes that his projects can let even more people experiment in their homes. Other scientists have responded that biohacking is inherently exclusive for its dependence on leisure time and money, and that deviance from general safety rules could lead to even harsher regulations for all. Zayner's public CRISPR kit campaign coincided with wider public scrutiny over genetic modification. Zayner maintained that these fears were based on misunderstandings of the product, as genetic experiments on yeast and bacteria cannot produce a viral epidemic. In April 2015, Zayner ran a hoax on Craigslist to raise awareness about the future potential of forgery in forensic genetic testing. Zayner later used CRISPR to attempt to edit his own genes and is the first known person to do so. His CRISPR kit was displayed at the Cooper Hewitt's 2019 Nature Design Triennial. In February 2016, Zayner attempted a full body microbiome transplant on himself, including a fecal transplant, to experiment with microbiome engineering and to see if he could treat his gastrointestinal and other health issues. The microbiome from the donor's feces successfully transplanted in Zayner's gut according to DNA sequencing done on samples. This experiment was documented by filmmakers Kate McLean and Mario Furloni and turned into the short documentary film Gut Hack. In December 2016, Zayner created a fluorescent beer by engineering yeast to contain the green fluorescent protein from jellyfish. Zayner's company, The ODIN, released kits to allow people to create their own engineered fluorescent yeast, which was met with some controversy as the FDA declared that the green fluorescent protein can be seen as a color additive. Zayner views the kit as a way that an individual can use genetic engineering to create new things in their everyday life. In 2019, Zayner launched a curriculum (Bioengineering 101 ) featuring a series of educational videos directed at those studying biotechnology for the first time.  Art  In the arts, Zayner's work has been featured in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, Philadelphia Museum of Art and others. While at the University of Chicago Zayner created a musical instrument, the Chromochord, which stimulates light-, oxygen-, and voltage-sensing proteins and translates their reactions into music. Together with composer Francisco Castillo Trigueros he received a grant from the university to compose music and create audio visual art installations using the work. Zayner, gave a musical performance using the Chromochord at NY MoMA PS1. Zayner was a resident artist at Stochastic Labs in Berkeley, California where he worked with the new media artist Lynn Hershman Leeson to create an art installation about genetic engineering, which included a booth designed by Zayner that attempted to reverse engineer a person's DNA from their picture. The installation was shown at ZKM and Deichtorhallen.  Medical investigation  The California Department of Consumer Affairs informed Zayner in May 2019 of their investigation into a complaint against him for practicing medicine without a license. By September of the same year Zayner received notice that the investigation had been concluded, and ‚Äúno further action is anticipated.‚Äù  References   Further reading   Category:Living people Category:1980s births Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:NASA people Category:DIY culture Category:American biophysicists ","title":"Josiah Zayner"},{"id":"50507581","text":"Christiane Bonnelle (, died 21 August 2016) was a French physicist and pioneering spectroscopist, who served as professor emeritus at Pierre and Marie Curie University.

He is considered Detroit's number one ambassador of art for world-renowned techno music artists. Haqq's artwork is featured worldwide on classic records by Detroit Techno record labels, namely the records of Juan Atkins, Metroplex, Derrick May, Transmat, Underground Resistance, Kevin Saunderson, Carl Craig. Abdul Qadim Haqq has been serving the techno music community through Techno Visual Art since 1989. His artwork continues to inspire fans all over the world. Haqq, founder of Third Earth Visual Arts, bases his futuristic concepts on time travel. His love for fantasy art was inspired by childhood pastimes such as watching sci-fi and Japanese animation. \\"Japanese cartoons were all I watched when I was a kid, like Speed Racer, Battle of the Planets and Robotech,\\" says Haqq. \\"I watched them constantly; I never missed an episode.\\" As a youth growing up in Detroit, Haqq was often sick from asthma and had to stay in the house, which caused him to spend a considerable portion of his time watching science fiction and fantasy shows on TV. These in turn led him to create and illustrate his own stories. Haqq majored in graphic illustration at the College for Creative Studies, originally called the Center for Creative Studies, in Detroit. After graduating in 1991, he committed himself to working as a futurist artist, and remains dedicated to Detroit Techno Art today. \\" ''  Career Haqq completed his first work for Derrick May's record label Transmat in October 1989. Later that year, Haqq met Mike Banks and UR. \\"We got our start when Derrick May from Transmat asked us to do artwork for his label. We started doing work there and he liked it, so he let us have a studio in the basement at Metroplex, which he arranged with Juan Atkins. Third Earth Visual Arts was originally four art students, but we all went different paths and I'm the only one who stuck with it for the past 25 years.\\" After completing art school in 1991, he met Banks and composed his first project for him. He recalls having the same feelings about the sound then and now; \\"[the music] always sounded like it was from beyond this world,\\" he says. At the time, UR was new, but the music was already alive. Haqq knew this from his nights spent dancing at the Music Institute, which is burnt into the city's history of computer dance jams. One day, Derrick May skimmed some of his journal entries on Native American rituals and chose some of Haqq's notes on the Lakotah for the backsleeve of his magnum opus, Rhythm is Rhythm's \\"The Beginning\\". That instance was just one of the increasing moments of Haqq's eye and eye (third and physical) visions that are evenly building optical rapture. \\"Abdul Qadim Haqq & Shinichiro Watanabe Joint Exhibition\\" held an Art exhibit from April 24, 2010 until August 1, 2010.

The \\"Technanomicron\\" is a 30-paged art book in 10\\" size entitled \\"The Rise of the Technolords\\". It contains abstract illustrations of important artists from Detroit, as well as short biographies written in Abdul's own unique science fiction style of Storytelling. Prolific and highly respected Detroit techno artist, Abdul Haqq, shares a selection of personal favourites and undisputed Detroit techno classics from the archives of Underground Resistance, Carl Craig, Derrick May, Jeff Mills and Suburban Knight. Over the years, Haqq has undertaken a whole foray of artwork for the aforementioned recording artists and their related labels. He was responsible for producing some of the earlier artwork for Transmat, closely followed by various projects for Planet E, including the well known Intergalactic Beats cover art. Subsequently, Abdul has worked very closely with Underground Resistance and still producing much of their label artwork to this day, remains the key figure in creating the unique imagery for the ultimate techno institution.

At its greatest extent it roughly corresponded to the present provinces of √âquateur and Tshuapa. Location The original four provinces of the Belgian Congo had considerable autonomy, but in 1933 they were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. The former √âquateur Province was renamed Coquilhatville Province after the capital city of Coquilhatville. A map of the 1933 administrative divisions shows Bangala District and Ubangi District had been merged to form Congo- Ubangi District in the north. In the south, the districts of Lulonga and √âquateur had been combined to form Tshuapa District. Tshuapa District bordered the French possessions across the Congo River to the west, Congo-Ubangi District to the north, Stanleyville District to the east, and Sankuru, Kasai and Lac L√©opold II districts to the south. The district was named after the Tshuapa River, which flowed westward through it to the Congo River. Coquilhatville Province was renamed √âquateur Province in 1947. By 1954 it had again been divided into Equateur, a smaller Tshuapa, Mongala and Ubangi districts. A 1955-1957 map shows Tshuapa District bounded by Mongala District to the north, Stanleyville District to the east, Sankuru, Kasai and Lac L√©opold II districts to the south and √âquateur District to the west. It covered the same territory as the modern province of Tshuapa. The area was out of a total of for Equateur province as a whole. On 14 August 1962 the new provinces of Cuvette Centrale (Equateur and Tshuapa) and Ubangi were split off from √âquateur Province, and the remainder of the province was placed under central administration, to become the province of Moyen-Congo (Mongala) on 5 February 1963. On 25 April 1966 Cuvette Centrale, Moyen-Congo, and Ubangi were reunited in a new √âquateur province. On 11 July 2015 √âquateur was split into a smaller √âquateur province and the new provinces of Tshuapa, Mongala, Nord- Ubangi and Sud-Ubangi. Tshuapa Province was formed from the Tshuapa district, whose town of Boende was elevated to capital city of the new province.

Education and early career Wu studied law at Central Police University after attending what became the National Pingtung University of Education. Subsequently, he enrolled at National Taiwan University's Graduate School of Building and Planning, and completed a master's degree in transportation engineering at National Chiao Tung University, followed by a doctorate in engineering at Chinese Culture University. He later pursued further education at the Graduate Program of Building and Construction within the University of London. Political career A prot√©g√© of Lee Teng-hui, Wu was also close to Wang Jin-pyng and Lien Chan. As leader of the Taiwan Provincial Planning and Developing Department from 1988 to 1992, Wu began taking kickbacks from a company installing water pumps in Banqiao District. He contested the 1993 local elections as a Kuomintang candidate for the magistracy of Pingtung County and won reelection in 1997. Alt URL Wu was indicted in 1996 for his actions in Banqiao, but not detained until a 1997 court order and had been released on medical parole in 1998. Later that year, local media reported Wu's expulsion from the Kuomintang. Alt URL He gained legal immunity in December via his election to the Legislative Yuan, as a representative for Pingtung County. In January 2000, Wu Tse-yuan and Lien Chan were accused of land speculation in Wuqi, Taichung, dating back to 1993. On 30 November 2000, the Taiwan High Court sentenced Wu to fifteen years imprisonment for the Banqiao corruption case. A week later, the Executive Yuan proposed an amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law targeting Wu and other politicians involved with black gold politics. The amendment sought to bar anyone serving a suspended sentence, a sentence longer than ten years imprisonment, or a death sentence from seeking public office. In addition, convicted racketeers released within ten years of an election would also be illegible for that election cycle. In March 2001, Wu was indicted in another corruption scandal involving the Pali Sewage Treatment Plant. He, Lo Fu-chu, and other legislators planned on founding a new political group affiliated with Lee Teng-hui in 2001, but the proposal was postponed that July. Wu left for Japan on 29 December 2001 as part of a junket, and never returned to Taiwan. He was tracked to Guangzhou some time later. In 2004, Taiwan Pineapple Group executive Huang Tsung-hung claimed that he bribed Wu in 1999 and asked Wu to help him secure a loan for his company. Personal life Wu Jin-lin is his younger brother. The younger Wu ran for a Pingtung County seat in the legislative elections of 2004, and won. The Apple Daily was the first Taiwanese publication to report Wu Tse-yuan's death in September 2008, but immediately afterward, both Wu Jin-lin and the Ministry of Justice refused to confirm media reports.

History The 2nd & Virginia site was formerly proposed as part of a $67 million condominium project in the early 1990s called \\"One Pacific Towers\\", which would have had two 27-story towers with 145 units in each, that was later cancelled. In 2008, developer Justen Company submitted proposals to build a 39-story, 234-unit condominium building on the same site, part of a two-tower project spanning Virginia Street, but did not move further on into the design review process. Bellevue-based developer Continental Properties bought the quarter-block property and master-use permit in March 2014 for $16 million, and announced plans to build a 324-unit residential building on the site using the previously-approved master-use permit. Initially planning to build condominiums, Continental instead opted to build apartments (later named \\"Tower 12\\") because of the higher value and lower risk involved. Construction of the building began on March 27, 2015 and the building opened on May 1, 2017. The building was topped out in August 2016.

The novel was serialised in five parts then published as a limited edition hardback by Island magazine and has been shortlisted in the Fiction Category of the 2016 Prime Minister's Literary Awards.  Plot  This novel is about 42-year-old Kennard Stirling, son of a wealthy family, who has spurned his inheritance in favour of a small town, rural New South Wales coast, where he spends his days helping the elderly and needy members of the community, while in his spare time working on his own hobby: a project to rejuvenate various bush blocks, but fertilised by the murdered remains of itinerants, drifters and economic losers that Stirling has judged not to offer anything to society. The World Repair Video Game enters the articulate, philosophical, but ultimately unsettling reflections of Kennard Sterling, as he holds modern Australian culture to our gaze.  Critical reception  The Australian's chief literary critic, Geordie Williamson wrote: \\"In The World Repair Video Game, Ireland has written an impossible novel: one shriven entirely of the social. Yet in doing so he has revealed the illogic that underlies what we call economic rationalism. He has drawn our coming world in a clear and terrible light.\\"\\"David Ireland: man with a mission to mulch\\" by Geordie Williamson, The Australian, 28 March 2015] Nicolas Rothwell wrote in The Australian that The World Repair Video Game is \\"a precise, controlled exercise in horror writing and cryptic social commentary, elegantly written, unremittingly dark. The tale is simply done: we travel in the mind of a monologue-spinning, self-justifying serial killer, a man on a mission to cleanse the fallen world.

Biography Gardea-Torresdey grew up in Parral, a mining area in Northern Mexico. He went back and forth to the United States as a child, where his parents were in school at the University of Southern California. He was raised in an upper-class family, and he had nine siblings, all of whom were younger. From an early age, Gardea-Torresdey was interested in chemistry, to the disappointment of his family of entrepreneurs. He obtained a doctorate at New Mexico State University, where he studied under Joseph Wang. Gardea-Torresdey joined the UTEP faculty in 1994 and became the chemistry department head in 2003. His work focuses on the use of nanoparticles. In 2002, Gardea-Torresdey led a team from UTEP and Mexico using technology at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) to study phytoremediation in alfalfa plants. The team demonstrated that alfalfa would extract gold from the medium in which it was growing and that it would store the gold in the form of nanoparticles. Gardea-Torresdey estimated that, after some refinement, the process could harvest gold amounting to about 20 percent of the weight of the plant. He received the 2009 Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).

The project, established at Princeton University, is the definitive edition of documents written by or to Jefferson. Work on the series began in 1944 and was undertaken solely at Princeton until 1998, when responsibility for editing documents from Jefferson's post- presidential retirement years, 1809 until 1826, shifted to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello. This enabled work to progress simultaneously on two different periods of Jefferson's life and thereby doubled the production of volumes without compromising the high standards set for the project.  History  The project grew out of a plan developed in 1943 by Julian P. Boyd, the chief librarian of Princeton University, a scholar of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, and the historian of the Thomas Jefferson Bicentennial Commission. The Commission tasked Boyd with studying whether or not a comprehensive collection of Jefferson's papers would be feasible. Prior to this less than 20% of Jefferson's papers had been published in any format and what had been published had been highly selective and thinly or poorly annotated. Boyd, who served as the project's first general editor, intended the finished project to be complete enough to replace what had been previously published and to ensure that the task would not have to be redone in the future. Princeton University agreed to host the editorial project and Princeton University Press also agreed to publish the volumes. Initial funding came from The New York Times Company. Although the United States government, which was in the midst of World War II, could not fund the early phases of the project's work, both President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his successor Harry S. Truman were enthusiastic supporters. The project's first volume was released in 1950 to near universal praise. As conceived by Boyd, the edition would consist of two series: one chronological and one topical. The chronological series includes letters written by and to Jefferson, as well as other documents such as memoranda, notes, and Jefferson's public addresses. The Papers of Thomas Jefferson cites itself as the \\"first modern historical documentary edition\\" and has exerted a strong influence on the presentation and organization of materials for other historical editions. Similar projects have used The Papers of Thomas Jefferson as their model. Boyd continued to work on the Papers until his death in 1980. Boyd's immediate successor, Charles T. Cullen, introduced computer technology and the systematic indexing of the volumes. During his lifetime of working on The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Boyd created new, higher ideals for historical editing. Which his successors Cullen, and Catanzariti continued after his death.

The Foundation assumed responsibility for Jefferson's papers composed between the end of his presidency on 4 March 1809 and his death on 4 July 1826. This new effort, named the Retirement Series, is also published by Princeton University Press in a similar format. Aided by a start-up grant from The Pew Charitable Trusts, work began in 1999 at Monticello under the editorial leadership of historian J. Jefferson Looney. The Retirement Series is expected to be completed in twenty-three annotated volumes. = Jefferson Quotes & Family Letters = In 2004 the Retirement Series launched a second project, Jefferson Quotes & Family Letters, a freely accessible collection of digital correspondence by, to, and between members of Jefferson's extensive family, excluding those to and from Jefferson himself. Ranging beyond Jefferson's life as far as the family's American Civil War experience, this material had not been part of the core Papers volumes and most of it had never been published elsewhere. These letters and other documents give personal insights into aspects of Jefferson's life that he seldom highlighted in his own writings, as well as providing accounts of the early years of the University of Virginia and of domestic, economic, and social life in nineteenth-century Virginia. Jefferson Quotes & Family Letters also features a growing collection of keyword-searchable quotes by and about Thomas Jefferson. The project is currently ongoing and new material is added regularly. =Retirement Series editors= *J. Jefferson Looney (Retirement Series Volumes 1 - current), 1999 -  Second Series  The Second Series edition is a collection of Jefferson's texts that are more suitable for topical rather than chronological arrangement. This Second Series of the edition, published by Princeton University Press, consists of commissioned volumes edited by subject specialists. Volumes published thus far are as follows: * Jefferson's Extracts from the Gospels: The Philosophy of Jesus and The Life and Morals of Jesus (1983, edited by Dickinson W. Adams) * Jefferson's Parliamentary Writings: Parliamentary Pocket-Book and A Manual of Parliamentary Practice (1988, edited by Wilbur Samuel Howell) * Jefferson's Literary Commonplace Book (1989, edited by Douglas L. Wilson) * Jefferson's Memorandum Books: Accounts, with Legal Records and Miscellany, 1767-1826 (1997, 2 volumes, edited by James A. Bear Jr. & Lucia C. Stanton)  Scope  The project's goal is to create as comprehensive a collection of Jefferson's personal and public papers as possible. Material collected for the project includes papers and letters written by Jefferson throughout the course of his life, both personal and professional. In order to show a complete version of events, the project also includes documents received by Jefferson. When completed, the project will have collected papers spanning from 14 January 1760 to Jefferson's death in 1826. The published papers are drawn from original manuscripts in repositories, libraries, and private collections from around the world. Collected as photocopies or digital scans, they are then carefully transcribed, verified, annotated, and indexed in order to provide as much context and accessibility as possible.  Design  The design for The Papers of Thomas Jefferson was created by Goudy Award-winning designer P. J. Conkwright of Princeton University Press, and one element of the design was a new Linotype font created for the edition. Called Monticello, the font was based on typefaces from Jefferson's era. In 2003 the English typographer Matthew Carter transformed the font into digital format.  Publications  President Truman at the Library of Congress receiving the first copy of Volume One of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson. Volumes for The Papers of Thomas Jefferson are released in print through Princeton University Press for both the pre- and post-1809 Jefferson papers. The first volume was published in 1950. As of January 2015, the Princeton editorial team has produced 41 volumes of work spanning the years between 14 January 1760 to 15 November 1803, with the first volume released in 1950. The Monticello team has completed 12 volumes as of January 2016. = Electronic edition = Beginning in April 2009, the published volumes became part of the University of Virginia Press's American Founding Era digital collection, a fully searchable subscription- based version of the volumes that are available in their entirety through its Rotunda electronic imprint. Updates and new documents are added to this edition at regular intervals and new volumes are added to Rotunda within two years of their print publication. In June 2013, the electronic edition also became available through the open access platform Founders Online, which is sponsored by the National Archives.  Funding  The Papers of Thomas Jefferson has been cited as a successful model of private-public sponsorship by the National Archives. In addition to Princeton University and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, Inc., the project has received support from the New York Times Company Foundation, the Packard Humanities Institute, the Florence Gould Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and other foundations and individuals. The project has been supported and able to continue and grow through the support of the many foundations and individuals. Beginning in the 1960s, the project also received federal support from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission.  Reception  Critical reception for the project and its released volumes has been positive. American historian David Chesnutt wrote that Boyd's approach to the Jefferson documents was very influential, stating \\"Modern historical editing dates from the publication of Julian Boyd's first volume of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson in 1950. Although there had been earlier compilations of the papers of famous Americans, his carefully prepared texts of Jefferson's letters and other writings, \\"warts and all,\\" set a new standard for accuracy and reliability.\\" American journalist and biographer Jon Meacham also praised the Jefferson Papers, calling it \\"one of the most formidable and significant scholarly undertakings in American life\\". = Awards = * Outstanding Academic Title by the American Library Association (2005, won - for The Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Retirement Series Volume 1) See also * The Washington Papers * The Papers of Abraham Lincoln * The Papers of James Madison * The Selected Papers of John Jay * Adams Papers Editorial Project * Papers of Martin Van Buren  Further reading  * References External links * at Princeton * The Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello * Jefferson Quotes and Family Letters at Monticello * Digital edition of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson at University of Virginia * Digital edition of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson at the National Archives Category:Historiography of the United States Category:Thomas Jefferson ","title":"The Papers of Thomas Jefferson"},{"id":"50508089","text":"Praba Malkanthi Udawatte (born October 4, 1980 in Kandy, Sri Lanka) is an Sri Lanka cricketer.

It was formerly named as Dongjing Labor Reform Detachment. The prison is governed by the Guangdong Prison Administrative Bureau. In 1982 the prison housed around 700 inmates, and in late 1995 the number of inmates was approximately 3,900. Website Jieyang Prison has a unique website that was the \\"first of its kind\\" in China, which provides information for the public, inmates and the families of inmates. In October 2014, the website received over 30,000 requests for inmate information and 270,000 page views. Family members of inmates can access the site using a username and password, and can obtain information about inmate health, prison terms, paroling, sentence reductions and how personal funds are spent in the prison. Reservations for visiting inmates can also be placed using the website. In April 2014, the prison implemented a video conferencing meeting system that is used for inmates to communicate with relatives who live far from the area or who are too ill to visit in person. The meeting system is coordinated through the prisons website. It is the first such system in China, and was initiated at Jieyang Prison as a pilot program. The meeting system was implemented in part to increase transparency and openness using such technology. Labor In 1996, it was reported in the publication \\"Prison Work Newsletter\\" published by the Chinese government that garments had been produced at Jieyang Prison for the prior 12 years. The work performed has been described as forced labor, because the inmates are required to do it. The garments are sold on the international market. Additional products produced at the prison include watchbands, artificial Christmas trees, mineral water, rosary beads and chinaware. Labor has been subcontracted at the prison from the Jixiang Knitting Garment Factory. It was reported in 1997 that approximately 80% of prison inmates perform the labor.

Its closest phylogenetic relative is candidatus Solibacter usitatus, according to Michael Nerdahl. It contains 5,650,368 nucleotides, 4,777 proteins, and 55 RNA genes, and has a circular chromosome according to information found from GenBank. According to the Joint Genome Institute, ‚ÄúThe bacterium is a gram-negative, highly capsulated, aerobic heterotroph that grows with a range of sugars, sugar polymers, and some organic acids.‚Äù It was first found in soil in a pasture from Australia in 2003, by a group of scientists led by S. J. Joseph. Although Koribacter has a very slow growth rate, sometimes taking up to a week to have a visible colony, it accounts for up to 14% of soil bacteria communities. The amount of Koribacter in soil is so abundant because iron is critical for its survival so with the large amount of iron in the soil it can thrive there. Koribacter plays a large role in regulating Carbon monoxide output on Earth. From previous studies about bacteria it has been found that CO-oxidizing bacteria remove 20% of the total CO emitted to the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. And because of that finding, ‚Äúit is then plausible that acidobacteria, including Koribacter, make a quantitatively significant contribution to two major parts of the carbon cycle: degradation of complex polymers and CO oxidation‚Äù, according to Michael Nerdahl.

Overview The composition was commissioned by Sentieri selvaggi and first performed by them at the Teatro Manzoni (Milano) in the year 2000. The American premiere took place in Houston on 17 February 2014. Glamorama Spies was inspired by Bret Easton Ellis' 1998 satire novel Glamorama. Analysis The piece consists of a single movement lasting around six minutes, written in a chromatic and dissonant idiom. The opening section begins with a semitonal \\"anxiety\\" theme and ostinato figures atop an ostinato bass line, marked by off-beat bass accents. A lyrical section follows in which these elements gradually move to the background while a gentle, contrapuntal \\"sentimental\\" theme emerges in the cello. The exchange between the two contrasting main themes is interrupted from time to time by dramatic chords on the piano, representing the point of view of the protagonist. The final section recapitulates some of the thematic material of the first section. At the end, the tension subsides, leaving room for ethereal harmonies and a conclusive ending.

Initially, she associated with Frances Benjamin Johnston, who later became her lover, living and working with her from 1909 for 8 years. Together they also established a firm called \\"Johnston-Hewitt Studio\\" in New York City in 1913 which functioned till 1917. They became well known in the field of architectural and landscape photography and took many pictures of famous buildings and gardens which were titled \\"Miss Johnston and Mrs. Hewitt\\" or \\"Frances Benjamin Johnston and Mattie Edwards Hewitt.\\" After the partnership with Johnston broke up in 1917, Hewitt ventured on her own and became famous in her own right as a commercial photographer. She set up her business establishment in photography with specific orientation to taking pictures for designers, architects, and landscape architects, recording interior and exterior views of home and business houses, and gardens. She continued in this profession until her death in Boston in 1956. A catalog of her work titled \\"Portrait of an Era in Landscape Architecture: The Photographs of Mattie Edwards Hewitt\\" is available as an exhibit catalog, (September 15 ‚Äì November 30, 1983) in the \\"Wave Hill\\", Bronx, New York. Biography Hewitt was born in October 1869 in Saint Louis, Missouri in a middle-class family. After a period of studying art she married Arthur Hewitt, a photographer. As his assistant, she was trained in principles of photography involving processing and printing. She started her career in photography as a small operation in St. Louis, Missouri where she lived and learned from the camera clubs and photography journals which then flourished during the late 19th century. She was also influenced by an article on photography by Frances Benjamin Johnston, published in the Ladies Home Journal. Her photography initially were on landscape, her home surroundings including chickens in the barnyard, the cat and the dog. During her visit to New York in 1901 to participate in the Pan- American Exposition held in Buffalo, New York, Hewitt met Johnston, who was then a famous photographer from Washington D.C.. Johnston made a profound influence not only on Hewitt's photographic career but also on her personal life for several years. She then became a fan of Johnston and started writing letters to her seeking her help professionally and personally. Hewitt sought her advice on several matters including providing a job opportunity for her husband with Lumi√®re, the French photographers and scientists, in his newly opened East Coast office in New York. She sought Johnston's advice for creating a dark room in her house, which however was built by her husband; this dark room made with walls fixed with terracotta building paper had enough shelves and space for two people to work freely. From this dark room of her husband's studio she printed photographs taken by Johnston. Hewitt's correspondence with Johnston, which was mostly one sided, was quite sensuous with declaration of her love for Johnston. Her letters to Johnston are part of the book titled \\"The Woman behind the Lens: The Life and Work of Frances Benjamin Johnston\\" (1864‚Äì1952) by Bettina Berch which also contain \\"epistolary exchanges of lady-love\\" letters of the then many other famous women such as between Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West, Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Edith Wynne Matthison, and Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict. One of Hewitt's letters to Johnston said \\"I wonder why I expect you to understand me better than most people ‚Äì is it because I love you so?\\" Based on these letters the author of the biography, asserts that the exchanges were \\"unswervingly lesbian... hardly straight forward\\". However, some scholars opine that such romantic exchange of letters was not unusual among the woman of the 19th century and consider them as not sensual. But many others feel that such writings are a \\"clue to a greater, if submerged, lesbian subculture\\". Hewitt then divorced her husband's entanglement Arthur Hewitt in 1909, and moved to New York to work and live with Johnston. After her divorce, she was dependent on photography as a profession for her living and pursued it with dedication, and had said \\"it is the most fascinating of arts\\". Her photographic career was a \\"transition from an amateur in the 19th century to 20th century professional\\", when there was substantial innovation in photographic equipment. Beechwood mansion Though she shifted to New York in 1909, it was only in 1913 that she established a photography firm, in partnership with Johnston, titled the \\"Johnston-Hewitt Studio\\" in New York, with a specialty in architectural and garden photography. While Johnston held the primary task of shooting for the studio, Hewitt functioned in the studio as the darkroom assistant. She was at this stage dependent on Johnston as her mentor. However, their partnership broke up in 1917, for reasons unknown. Hewitt developed her own professional skill in home and garden photography, and operated independently. By this time, she had a good clientele to pursue business on her own. With her office in New York City, she became a freelance photographer and executed many assignments by taking pictures of mansions and gardens of rich people of the East Coast. Her nephew Richard Averill Smith had also associated with her on some of the assignments. Many of these pictures were published in newspapers and magazines, along with articles on the mansions in the New York Times, the Evening Post, House Beautiful, and House & Garden, and Garden Magazine. In 1910, Hewitt had taken photographs of the Albert Boardman Estate in Southampton which was published in Southampton Times in 1912 and again in 1916 which brought her professional skill to limelight. In all the photographs she took, carrying heavy wooden cameras and wooden tripods, for clients she also took additional pictures which she offered to newspapers and magazines for publication as part of an article. She also maintained a good record of negatives with names of clients, architects, and location. She had also taken photographs for buildings of Carr√®re & Hastings who had recommended her work to others. In the words of Robin S. Karson, author of the book titled Fletcher Steele, Landscape Architect: An Account of the Gardenmaker's Life, 1885‚Äì1971, Hewitt was \\"one of the best known and most lyrical garden photographers of her day.\\" Hewitt took photographs documenting the estate for the Paris Exhibition of 1930. These photographs have been said to \\"glimmer with drops of light reflecting from shiny-leaved willows\\".

It was formed from part of Uele District in 1912. It roughly corresponded in area to the present Haut-U√©l√© province. Location Haut-Uele District (Upper Uele District) was named after the Uele River, and covers the upper part of the river basin. Belgian Congo The Haut-Uele District was created by an arr√™t√© royal of 28 March 1912, which divided the Congo into 22 districts. A 1912 map shows that the former Uele District had been broken into the Haut-Uele and Bas-Uele (Lower Uele) districts. Haut-Uele was bordered by French territory to the north, British territory to the east, Ituri and Stanleyville districts to the south and Bas-Uele to the west. The Haut-Uele District became part of the Orientale Province created in 1913. Two miners in Kilo-Moto c. 1941 Kilo-Moto is a region in the far northeast corner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where gold was discovered in the Ituri River by government prospectors in 1903. Moto is in the Haut-U√©l√© Province and Kilo in the Ituri Province. The Kilo mine was opened in 1905 and the Moto mine in 1911. Gold was also extracted by panning the river gravels. In 1919 the government created the R√©gie Industrielle des Mines de Kilo-Moto, an autonomous body. At the end of 1919 Louis Franck, the Minister of the Colonies, gave Georges Moulaert, former governor of √âquateur Province, responsibility for the Kilo-Moto state mines. These were located in largely hostile territory, with no communications and very primitive operations. Moulaert tackled improvements to roads, transport, medical support, supplies and crops, as well as mining installations, exploitation of alluvium and eluvium deposits, prospecting and research. Between 1920 and 1924 the company built of roads, with many metal bridges, and installed of telegraph and telephone lines. In 1924 a hydroelectric power station was inaugurated at Soleniana and the grinding plant was electrified. Due to poor transport across the Congo region, particularly the Matadi-L√©opoldville Railway, the company developed a route from the Uele River to the Nile to transport cotton, coffee and other products of the region. In 1926 the R√©gie was converted into a commercial company, the Soci√©t√© des Mines d‚ÄôOr de Kilo-Moto. Hydroelectric stations were built to power the crushing plants, and by 1930 the two mines, but mostly Kilo, were producing almost annually. Moulaert was made chairman of the board. He continued to head the company until 1947. Moulaert boosted gold production at Kilo-Moto, but his methods were questioned, particularly forced recruitment of Black workers, who totaled 10,012 in 1918 and over 40,000 in 1939. Alexis Bertrand wrote a 1932 report that strongly criticized the practices at the Kilo-Moto gold mines. The report said from 35% to 50% of able bodied adult men were forced to leave their homes to work the gold deposits, far above the official limit of 10% set by the Manpower Commission. This caused public controversy. Moulaert strongly defended \\"his\\" company, but criticism continued into the 1940s. With the 1933 reorganization Bas-Uele and Haut-Uele were again combined into Uele District, and lay in the new Stanleyville Province. By 1954 Stanleyville Province had been renamed Orientale Province, and Uele District had again been split into Bas-Uele and Haut-Uele districts. A 1955‚Äì1957 map shows Haut-Uele District bordered by French territory to the north, Ituri District to the southeast, Stanleyville District to the southwest and Bas-Uele District to the west. The area was out of a total of for Orientale province as a whole. Post-independence On 27 July 1962 the administration of Orientale Province was taken over by the central government. It was divided into the new provinces of Kibali-Ituri, U√©l√© and Haut-Congo. On 28 December 1966 Orientale Province was reunited. The Durba Mine is a gold mine in the Haut-Uele Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, within the Kilo-Moto greenstone belt. As of 2011 a joint venture between AngloGold Ashanti and Randgold Resources was actively developing the Kibali Gold Mine concession centered on this mine. Between 1998 and 2000, co- circulating Marburg virus and Ravn virus caused 154 cases of Marburg virus disease and 128 deaths among illegal gold miners in Durba and nearby Watsa. The 2008 Christmas massacres took place on 24-27 December 2008, when the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a Ugandan rebel group, attacked several villages in Haut-Uele District. The Makombo massacre took place from 14 to 17 December 2009 in the village and region of Makombo in the Haut-Uele district. Human Rights Watch (HRW) believes the attacks, which killed 321 people, were perpetrated by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which denied responsibility. In 2015 Orientale Province was broken up into the provinces of Bas-U√©l√©, Haut- U√©l√©, Ituri and Tshopo.

In 1915, the operetta La Cocarde de Mimi-Pinson, a theatre play in honour of the poilus fighting for the French flag, was a triomph at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Apollo in Paris. At the beginning of World War I, midinettes nicknamed Mimi Pinson, were making tricolor rosettes for the benefit of solidarity funds (a work led by Gustave Charpentier). Henri Goublier thought that the current events could be a good subject operetta. Goublier obtained the agreement of Maurice Ordonneau, one of the fashionable authors of the time for the libretto, a project which Francis Gally joined. The operetta was presented 25 November 1915.

The parish encompassing Manaoag and the surrounding towns is administered by the Order of Preachers under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan. It was officially declared a Basilica on February 17, 2015. Some of the miracles attributed to Our Lady of Manaoag are depicted in murals inside the church's transepts and nave. The Paschal Chapel beside the south flank of the church has icons of the Black Nazarene similar to that of the Quiapo Church, the Santo Entierro (Dead Christ), and other statues of the Virgin Mary. The sanctuary on the left side of the main entrance has a large image of the Crucified Christ. Behind the church are the Parish Office, Museum of Our Lady of The Rosary of Manaoag, Candle Gallery, Pilgrims‚Äô Center and Rosary Garden. There is also an Information Center at the Priory at the left side of the church and souvenir shops at the front office of the church, beside the Veneration Room at the second floor behind the main sanctuary, and at the Candle Gallery in the space behind of the church.  History  The Augustinians built the first Chapel of Santa Monica (the original name of Manaoag) in 1600, at the site of the present graveyard. It was served by the friars from the town of Lingayen, who were succeeded by the Dominicans in 1605 and served from the town of Mangaldan.\\"History\\". Shrine of Our Lady of The Rosary of Manaoag Official Website. Retrieved on 2014-01-05. The first Dominican priest to work in the Manaoag mission was Juan de San Jacinto, O.P., who was the first curate of Mangaldan. It was only in 1608 that the Mangaldan mission was formally accepted by the provincial chapter of the Dominicans. In 1610, Tom√°s Jim√©nez, O.P. became the Manaoag mission's first resident priest. Numerous threats from the Igorot tribes of the surrounding mountains led to the transfer of the entire community to the present site on a hill. The Dominicans started to build a large church on its present site in 1701 under the sponsorship of Gaspar de Gamboa and his wife, Agata Yangta, who were wealthy residents from Manila who moved to Lingayen. Later expansion of the church from 1882 was frustrated by an earthquake in 1892. During the tumult of the Philippine Revolution for independence from Spain, revolutionaries set fire to the church, its treasures, ornaments, and records on 10 May 1898. The image narrowly escaped destruction; it was found abandoned at the back of the church. It was spirited away to Dagupan City, where it was kept from June to October 1898. The Dominicans returned in 1901 upon the invitation of Rev. Mariano Pacis, the diocesan priest of Manaoag. Under the aegis of the Dominicans, the church that was started in 1882 was finally completed to a large extent in 1911-12. The central retablo, incorporating Baroque columns from the 18th-century altar, was completed by the famed Tampinco Atelier of Manila. The transepts were completed in 1931-32. The Dominicans ceded all their Pangasinan missions to the diocesan clergy except Manaoag. Spiritual administration of the shrine in perpetuity was granted by the Holy See to the Order of Preachers in 1925. A huge crowd attended the Canonical Coronation of the image on 21 April 1926 by then-Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines Guglielmo Piani, S.D.B., as authorized by Pope Pius XI. This meant that the Catholic Church officially recognized and proclaimed that The Virgin Mary acclaimed as Our Lady of The Rosary of Manaoag had granted favors and blessings to or formidable intercessions for her devotees through the centuries. The church was rebuilt after surviving Japanese bombardment during the Second World War. The old convento is now the Our Lady of Manaoag College, founded as Holy Rosary Academy in 1946 by the last Spanish Dominican in Manaoag, Rev. Teodulo Cajigal, O.P.. Since 8 December 1972, the Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Manaoag has been under the Philippine Dominican Province. It celebrated the Diamond Jubilee of the image's canonical coronation on 1 January 2000. = Canonical affiliation with Saint Mary Major = On 21 June 2011, Cardinal Bernard Francis Law, Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major in Rome and Pope Benedict XVI canonically approved the granting of a \\"Special Bond of Spiritual Affinity in Perpetuity\\" through which the pilgrims are assured of the same blessings and entitlement to a plenary indulgence equal to that received when visiting a papal basilica in Rome. This was confirmed by the prelate (now Archbishop) of the Lingayen- Dagupan, Socrates B. Villegas, in a circular dated June 13, 2011.J.E.(2011-06-08). \\"CBCP: Vatican approves indulgences for Manaoag visitors\\". GMA News Network. Retrieved on 2014-01-05. The Manaoag Shrine is the first to achieve this status followed by the Shrine of Our Lady of Caysasay in Taal, Batangas in June 2012. The official document and a shrine official, who was among the priests who went to Rome, confirmed that a plenary indulgence (of a maximum of one per day) may be obtained on each visit to the Shrine in a spirit of detachment from the attraction of sin subject to three conditions for each occasion: going to confession immediately before or after the pilgrimage; attending a Mass and receiving the Eucharist during the pilgrimage; and praying for the intentions of the Pope at the Shrine. = Elevation to basilica = In February 2015, the Shrine of Our Lady of The Rosary of Manaoag was elevated to a minor basilica in a ceremony attended by more than 100 archbishops and bishops, leaders of church and state, and numerous devotees. The Shrine was henceforth called the Basilica of Our Lady of The Rosary of Manaoag, headed by a rector appointed by the Archbishop of Lingayen-Dagupan.Administrator (2012-05-27). \\"Manaoag Shrine elevated to Basilica\\".

It stars Miranda Raison, Sam Keeley, Daniella Kertesz, Elarica Johnson and Lorna Nickson Brown as five twentysomethings who mysteriously end up in a remote cabin by the sea following a nightclub fire. Plot Strong willed and organised Robyn wakes up unexpectedly on a strange beach. Panicked and with strange supernatural events happening around her she runs to a small cabin not far away. There she finds Seb is enjoying himself in a threesome with outgoing Patricia and the youngest, kind-hearted, Livvy. Uncertain of where she is she speaks to the three and finds out that they are in some sort of afterlife following the collapse of a roof in an overcrowded nightclub. Suddenly quiet and shy Onie appears out of no-where, suggesting she may be teetering between life and death. Clues are provided by the cabin itself, the different rooms, and two paintings inside the cabin. Whilst the five get to know each other tensions flare as they try and work out why they are all there. A nearby lighthouse causes them all to have terrifying flashbacks accompanied by deafening sounds. Any attempt to walk away from the cabin towards the lighthouse is met by them somehow ending back up at the hut. Despite Onie trying to self-harm, and the girls trying to kill Seb, it appears they can no longer 'die' again as they are already dead. A supernatural being of unknown power, manifesting as black smoke, takes over the bodies of Seb and Robyn at various points. As time passes the 'bubble' they are trapped in slowly grows smaller around the cabin, which contains different rooms from each of the occupants lives. It is determined that the house is a single occurrence of a cosmic test which everyone must undergo upon death (each group of deceased people encountering a unique house but the same test), with the solution being not to sin again having reached the tabula rasa (\\"blank slate\\") house. It is also determined that no one has ever passed the test, that everyone outside the bubble is in Hell, and that Heaven is empty because of this. Onie reappears and disappears for one last time having decided to live, leaving a blanket to control the smoke monster. Livvy uses the blanket to make Robyn possessed, revealing that she figured out Robyn's sin (she was the night club manager who let too many people in and caused the collapse) and convincing her to use the demon power to take Livvy to Heaven (hoping it will cause a destruction of all afterlife, harking back to a saying Patricia's father had said about Heaven being destroyed if a sinner were to enter). Upon destruction of the afterlife, Hell would theoretically also be destroyed, freeing every soul who ever died from it. At the end the bubble closes on itself and the film ends abruptly, with the result of Livvy's plan left ambiguous.

It is located in the centre of the suburb on Forest Road with stairway access to the railway station. The centre includes a 2,700sqm Coles supermarket and around 38 speciality stores.  History  Hurstville railway station opened in 1884 on the terminus of the Illawarra line from Redfern. The train station was an open air type train station until Hurstville Super Centre opened in 1965. In 1956, a cake shop owner at Wynyard railway station lodged an application with Hurstville Council to build a shopping centre above Hurstville Railway Station. The cake shop owner was inspired by the way shops sat above Wynyard's train line. So he proposed a five-storey development above Hurstville Station. Kogarah Council, which had control over the Ormonde Parade side of the train station, approved the plan. Construction started on the site in 1957 with the centre originally to be called Bowes Super Centre. The construction came to a halt by that year since the opening of the Top Ryde Shopping Centre. The plan changed to the centre to 5 storeys and then above. In 1961, the project, now known as the Hurstville Super Centre, projected a completion date of late 1962. The opening date was set to 1965 after objections with the former Hurstville Mayor Gordon Hill and the former Federal Transport Minister John McMahon. The first stage of the centre officially opened on 13 September 1965 by NSW Premier Robert Askin with an estimated 8,000 people lined onto Forest Road and crowded into the centre. However rival centre Roselands officially opened on 13 October 1965, just a month later. Since the opening, customers were promised a lot more in the future than the fifty shops and rooftop carpark. The original plans from the early 1960s included extra parking, \\"Prestige\\" shopping level above the existing shopping centre, offices and six levels of apartments. In the 1970s there was hope that it would proceed as per original plans. However the development was never built further than stage one. With the purchase of Miranda Fair (now Westfield Miranda) by the Westfield Group and the opening of nearby Westfield Hurstville in 1987 saw the centre fall into a gradual decline. During the 1990s the centre lost many stores with many vacant store spaces left including Franklins (which had replaced Coles) closed. By the mid-2000s the centre was desolate with large areas vacant and the structure itself in a bad state. However, during this time there have been several ownership changes with the centre purchased and owned by Cerno Group. Hurstville Super Centre before it was demolished In 2007 Hurstville Super Centre underwent a redevelopment, costing $15 million. During this refurbishment, the centre was rebuilt and included a Coles supermarket and an upgraded concourse with many new a stores as well. The redevelopment was completed in 2008 and the centre was renamed Hurstville Central. There have previously been plans to build several residential towers above the station and the centre but these plans have been shelved over concerns about the integrity of overhead supports in the event of a derailment.

Background Olivorio Mateo, known as Pap√° Liborio, was a religious healer and popular leader of the early twentieth century in the southern region of the country, who created a self-reliant commune in the mountains of San Juan de la Maguana. Born to an impoverished family, he reportedly disappeared during a 1908 hurricane, that swept the south-west region of the country. When his family performed a novena (nine days of prayer for the dead), he suddenly reappeared. Olivorio had claimed that he was transported to heaven and was sent back to earth by God. He was received as an incarnate of Jesus Christ and was worshipped. Liborio had established a cult in the region, and the idea of fighting for \\"the salvation of the world and build a different world\\" based on criteria of equality and solidarity. During the United States occupation of the Dominican Republic, he was branded as a threat and was persecuted and killed. =Liborista movement= This messianic legacy was collected in 1962 by Romilio and Le√≥n Ventura Rodriguez, twin brothers and liborista priests, who established a new commune, north of Palma Sola, near Las Matas de Farf√°n and led a movement that followed the preachings that Olivorio Mateo had reported 40 years earlier. In addition to the area, general Alcantara Miguel Angel Ram√≠rez, a former exile in Central America, vivified and increased the influence of the twin priests in the inserting area in political activities. The election results strongly favored them with help from influential people in the region, and in political terms, created branches of Palma Sola. Events This religious community in Palma Sola who followed the preachings of Olivorio Mateo, was considered a threat to the social economic, and religious status quo. On 26 December 1962, the Dominican government decided to end the mass movement, prompting the dispatch of a military contingent that performed a napalm airstrike killing 600 people in the area. Among those dead was inspector general Miguel Rodr√≠guez Reyes of the Dominican armed forces, who allegedly arrived on the same day to negotiate a treaty and was considered an accidental casualty of the strike. Some manifestations of this cult still exist in the southern region of the Dominican Republic.

The district dates back to the days of the Belgian Congo. At its greatest extent it roughly corresponded to the northern part of the current Lualaba Province and to the present Haut-Lomami Province. Belgian Congo The original four provinces of the Belgian Congo had considerable autonomy, but in 1933 they were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. Katanga became Elisabethville Province. The number of districts in the colony was reduced to 15. Elisabethville Province was divided into Lualaba District in the west, and Tanganika District and Haut-Katanga District in the east. By 1955 Lualaba had been greatly reduced in size, with the northern part of the district split off as Haut-Lomami District and part of the east transferred to Luapula-Moero District. A 1955‚Äì1957 map shows Haut-Lomami District bordered by Lulua District and Kabinda District to the north, Tanganika District to the northeast., Luapula-Moero District to the southeast, Lualaba District to the south and Portuguese territories to the west. The area was out of a total of for Katanga province as a whole. Post-independence On 11 July 1960, a few days after the Congo Republic had gained independence, the province of Katanga seceded as an independent state. In November 1961 the northern portion was reconquered by the national government and made the province of Nord-Katanga. On 21 January 1963 the remainder of Katanga was reconquered and divided into the provinces of Lualaba and Katanga Oriental. Nord-Katanga, Lualaba and Katanga Oriental were merged back into the province of Katanga on 28 December 1966. In 2015 Haut-Lomami Province was formed from Haut-Lomami district, whose town of Kamina was elevated to capital city of the new province.

It went through various changes in extent. It roughly corresponded to the present provinces of Kwilu and Kwango. Congo Free State In 1895 the number of the districts in the Congo Free State was increased to fifteen. The districts now included Kwango District. It had been carved out of the west of the Kasai District. A map of the Congo Free State in 1897 shows the Kwango Oriental district bounded by the Stanley Pool District to the west, the Lualaba Kassai District to the east, and Portuguese possessions (Angola) to the south. The district extended south from the point where the combined Kwango and Kwilu rivers entered the Kasai River, and included the watershed of the Wamba River. The Kwango River formed the border with the Portuguese territory to the west, and the eastern boundary was to the east of the Kwilu River. Belgian Congo The Congo Free State was annexed by Belgium in 1908 as the Belgian Congo. Kwango is shown with slightly different boundaries in maps of 1910, 1912, 1926 and 1933. In 1910 Kwango bordered Bas- Congo to the west, Moyen-Congo to the northwest, Lac L√©opold II to the northeast and Kasai to the east. Congo-Kasai formally become a vice-government in 1919. It contained the districts of Bas-Congo, L√©opoldville, Kwango, Kasai and Sankuru. With the 1933 reorganization Bas-Congo, L√©opoldville, Kwango and Lac L√©opold II were included in the L√©opoldville Province. A map from 1955-1957 showed a much smaller Kwango District after the northern part had been made into Kwilu District. Kwango was now bordered by the Portuguese territories to the south, Cataractes District to the west, Kwilu District to the north and Kasai District to the east. The area was out of a total of for L√©opoldville province as a whole.

The castle stands within the parish of Kalkofen, over a kilometre north of the village itself, which is part of the municipality of Hohenfels in the county of Konstanz in Germany. The castle gave its name to the municipality of Hohenfels which was created in 1973.  Location  The castle is located around eight kilometres east of Stockach and twelve kilometres north of Lake Constance, on the spur of a south-tilting kuppe of a forested hill ridge.  History  Hohenfels Castle has more than 700 years of history. It was founded by the lords of Hohenfels and was the family seat of the Neu-Hohenfels, a branch of Alt-Hohenfels with its family seat at Hohenfels in Bonndorf in the county of Konstanz, who had settled here in the 12th century. Hohenfels Castle was first mentioned in 1292 as \\"Neuhohenfels\\". The Neuhohenfels line died out in 1352, and the Barony of Neuhohenfels, including its castle, passed by marriage to the lords of Jungingen, who managed to largely reunite the two Hohenfels estates in the early 15th century through marriage. After flourishing for a short period, the family territory was divided again in 1441 into the Jungingen-Althohenfels and Jungingen- Neuhohenfels estates and fell into decay. After the death in 1501 of the last male member of the Jungingen family, Ulrich of Jungingen, in 1506 his sister Anna sold the Barony of Neuhohenfels to the Teutonic Order.See cited literature and the deed dated 1 August 1506 in the Sigmaringen State Archives Ho 160 T 2 No. 8 Since then the estate has been owned by the Landkomturei Altshausen of the Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Alsace and Burgundy. For exactly 300 years, from 1506 to 1806, the Teutonic Order dominated Altshausen influenced the Barony of Hohenfels. In 1553 and 1642 there were fires at the castle. In 1806, the Teutonic Order estate of Hohenfels, which was managed by an Obervogtei (senior advocate's office), and which included Hohenfels Castle as well as the villages of Deutwang, Kalkofen, Liggersdorf, Mindersdorf and Selgetsweiler, together with the Teutonic Order estate of Achberg came under the sovereignty of the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and was incorporated into the Obervogtei of Hohenfels. The castle passed through the hands of the princely House of Hohenzollern to the School of Schloss Salem.  References   Literature  * Christian H.

The site, which follows the path of a section of Hadrian's Wall, is notable for an unusually wide range of grassland types growing on thin soil above the Whin Sill, a rock formation peculiar to the Northern Pennines. Location and natural features Allolee to Walltown is situated in the north-east of England, some east-north- east of Greenhead and north-north-west of Haltwhistle. It is an east-west corridor of land straddling Hadrian's Wall for a distance of between Milecastle 45 (Walltown) to the west, and Turret 43B in the east, just short of the fort of Aesica (Great Chesters). Milecastle 44 (Allolee) is found at approximately the middle point of the east-west SSSI site. The site is situated on the Whin Sill, igneous rock dolerite found in County Durham and Northumberland, which outcrops as high, rocky cliff lines, and which was used by the builders of Hadrian's Wall to full strategic advantage. The particular rock of the Winn Sill gives rise to conditions less acidic than comparable types, and the overlying soil is thin and peaty; it provides a habitat for glasses than tolerate dry conditions, notably wild chives (Allium schoenoprasum), rare in Northumberland other than on the Whin Sill. =Vegetation= Besides wilc chives, the thin soil of the site supports biting stonecrop (Sedum acre), hairy stonecrop (S. villosum), wild thyme (Thymus praecox), parsley piert (Aphanes arvensis), common whitlow-grass (Erophila verna), early hair-grass (Aira praecox), annual knawel (Sceleranthus annuus), rue-leaved saxifrage (Saxifraga tridactylites) and long-stalked cranesbill (Geranium columbinum). Grassland surrounding drier areas is composed of red fescue (Festuca rubra), common bent (Agrostis capillaris), sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and heath grass (Danthonia decumbens). Crags and north-facing scarp slopes support bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and heather (Calluna vulgaris), fir clubmoss (Lycopodium selago) and parsley fern (Cryptogramma crispa). Green spleenwort (Asplenium viride) is found on limestone outcrops. More calcareous areas support a herb-rich grassland with meadow oat-grass (Avenula pratensis), quaking grass (Briza media), dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium), greater burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis) and salad burnet (S. minor). On unit of the site, a dip slope east of Allolee has poor drainage, which supports a 'most unusual' species-rich grassland dominated by purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and having quaking grass, meadow oat-grass, spring sedge (Carex caryophyllea), glaucous sedge (C. flacca), tawny sedge (C. hostiana), flea sedge (C. pulicaris), lady's mantle (Alchemilla filicaulis), lady's bedstraw (Galium verum), fairy flax (Linum catharticum), cowslip (Primula veris), devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), greater burnet and wild thyme.

Built in Kerala architectural style on a plot of land measuring approximately 4 acres, the building is located at Manissery, a village in Ottapalam in Palakkad. It is a popular shooting location for Malayalam films and several commercially successful films such as Devasuram, Aaraam Thampuran, Rappakal were filmed on its premises.  Profile  The Varikkasseri family is reported to have a history of over 1000 years and the family is known to have occupied a sovereign position among Ashta gruha (Eight Families) Namboothiri families. The Mana was built by Varikkassery Ravi Namboothirippad in or about 1902, using locally available red stone. An expansive padippura (gate house) provides the entry to the three-storied building complex which comprises a nalukettu with 74 rooms, two pathayappuras (outhouses), a large pond and the adjoining bath house, a family temple complex consisting three temples of Shiva, Krishna and Ayyappan, and an oottupura (dining hall), which has since been demolished. It was designed by Krishnan Thampuran, also known as Shilpi Thampuran, of Varikkasseri family, who had earlier studied architecture in Chennai and his exposure to western architecture is seen in the design of the building, especially in the long slender columns surrounding the portico of the building. The beams, doors and windows are made out of wood and are adorned with intricate carvings. The house was used in a number of Malayalam films, starting with Theertham, the 1987 film made by Mohan. It is reported that the principal photography of over 100 films have been done here which include Devasuram, Aaraam Thampuran, Rappakal, Anandabhadram, Drona,, Simhasanam, Madampi, Sufi Paranja Katha, Jana (Tamil),Thooval Kottaram, Valliettan, Kaavalan, Manthrikan and Pretham 2. Visitors are allowed in the complex when no film is being shot, but access to the ritually pure thevarapura is restricted to Brahmins who intend to perform rituals.

At the start of the First World War it was the strongest party in parliament, and on the ending of that war in 1918 the party leader Karl Renner became chancellor of the First Republic. The party lost power in 1920, but retained a strong base of support in the capital Vienna. A period of rising political violence culminated in the banning of the Social Democratic Party under the Austrofascist dictatorship (1934‚Äì38). In 1918, the Socialists supported union with Germany, but the Allies forbid this in the treaty of St. Germain. When the Nazis took power in Germany the Socialists changed their view on the Anschluss, which took place in 1938 and brought Austria into the Second World War. In 1945 the party was reconstituted as the \\"Socialist Party of Austria\\" (Sozialistische Partei √ñsterreichs, SP√ñ), led by Adolf Sch√§rf. The party entered the government of the Second Republic as part of a grand coalition with the People's Party (√ñVP) until 1966, Renner becoming the Republic's first president. From 1971 to 1983, under Bruno Kreisky, the Socialist Party was the sole governing party. For the following three years it ruled in coalition with the Freedom Party (FP√ñ), then up to 2000 it was again part of a grand coalition with the √ñVP, with Franz Vranitzky as Chancellor until 1997. In 1991 it reverted to including \\"Democratic\\" in its name, becoming the \\"Social Democratic Party of Austria\\" (Sozialdemokratische Partei √ñsterreichs). During this period, the grand coalition combined with the \\"Proporz\\" systemwhereby important posts throughout the government were shared out between members of the two main partiesevoked rising discontent. This was a factor in the growing popularity of the FP√ñ, which came second to the SP√ñ in elections in 1999. The following year the FP√ñ and √ñVP formed a rightwing coalition, displacing the Social Democrats from a share in government. While this coalition was still in power, the Social Democrat Heinz Fischer was elected president in 2004. Following the 2006 elections another grand coalition was formed between the SP√ñ and √ñVP, this lasting until 2017.  From the beginnings until 1918  Socialist and worker's movements and associations had already started to form in Austria by the mid-19th century. The party's first meeting took place in 1874 in Neud√∂rfl in what later became Burgenland. The following years saw factional infighting, and the party split into moderate and more radical factions. It was united in 1889 as the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria (, SDAP√ñ) through the work of Doctor Victor Adler. At the party congress in Hainfeld, the party decided to accept Adler's Declaration of Principles on 30 December 1888. 1 January 1889 is therefore considered the party's founding date. On 12 July 1889 the first issue of the party newspaper the Arbeiter-Zeitung was printed. Initially close to Marxism, the party continued to grow especially in Vienna and the industrial areas of Bohemia, Moravia, Styria, Lower Austria and Upper Austria. The party participated in the founding of the Second International in Paris on 14 July 1889. The party campaigned for more rights for workers, including their right to vote. In the Br√ºnner Programm of September 1899, the Socialists demanded that the Austro-Hungarian Empire be reformed into a federal democratic state. The Social Democrats were allowed to run in the City Council (Gemeinderat) elections of Vienna on 30 May 1890. In Trieste the Italian- speaking \\"Social Democratic League\\" (Lega Social Democratica) decided at its congress in December 1897 to change its name to \\"Adriatic Italian Section of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria\\" (Sezione Italian Adriatica del Partito dei Lavoratori Social Democratici in Austria). Notably, the Trieste Socialists preferred to use the label \\"socialist\\" rather than \\"social democrat\\".Winkler, Eduard. Wahlrechtsreformen und Wahlen in Triest 1905 ‚Äì 1909: eine Analyse der politischen Partizipation in einer multinationalen Stadtregion der Habsburgermonarchie. S√ºdosteurop√§ische Arbeiten, 105. M√ºnchen: Oldenbourg, 2000. pp. 84‚Äì85 In 1907, after a general strike, universal suffrage was granted. In the elections to the House of Deputies in the Reichsrat, the Social Democrats were able to win many votes. Out of a total of 516 seats, the party won 87 seats, becoming the second strongest fraction in parliament after the Christian Social Party. Eventually, by 1911, the Socialists became the strongest party in parliament. The party initially supported the declaration of war against Serbia after the Assassination in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg in 1914, but soon realised that the disastrous war was untenable. After the death of Emperor Franz Joseph, the first peace-meeting was held in December 1916. By January 1918, strikes were breaking out, calling for an end of the war and the terrible suffering that the people, especially the worker's families, had to endure. By October, a provisional national assembly (\\"Provisorische Nationalversammlung\\") was convened under the Social Democrat Karl Renner, which tried to work out a provisional constitution (Provisorische Verfassung) under the leadership of a new state council led by the new state chancellor Renner. The Social Democrats wanted a new form of government and, on 12 November 1918, the republic was proclaimed by Renner. Renner's government introduced an eight-hour workday and paid holidays.A Concise History of Austria by Steven Beller First Republic The party had moderate success in the 1920s, but its conflict with right wing forces escalated until it was defeated in the Austrian Civil War. =Establishment of the First Republic= The SDAP√ñ played an important role in the establishment of the First Republic. On November 11, 1918, Emperor Charles I relinquished his right to take part in Austrian affairs of state. The following day Karl Renner was declared Chancellor of the Republic of German-Austria. The Bohemian provincial organization of SDAP√ñ held a conference in Teplice 31 August ‚Äì 3 September 1919 at which it re-constituted itself as a separate party, the German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic. The party clearly wanted to steer Austria towards political union with Germany, calling the new Austrian republic \\"Deutsch-√ñsterreich\\" (German-Austria). But the Treaty of St. Germain clearly forbade any unification between Austria and Germany. The SDAP√ñ nevertheless still advocated such a union during the existence of the First Republic, as they hoped for a strengthening of their position and the socialist cause within a Greater Germany. In the first elections for the constitutional national assembly on 16 February 1919, women were allowed to vote for the first time. The SDAP√ñ became the strongest party and formed a grand coalition with the anti-AnschlussDIVIDE ON GERMAN AUSTRIA. ‚Äì Centrists Favor Union, but Strong Influences Oppose It., The New York Times, 17 January 1919 (PDF) Christian Social Party (CS). =Red Vienna= In May, elections for the city council of Vienna followed: out of 165 mandates the social democrats won 100 seats. Jakob Reumann became the first social-democratic mayor of Vienna. Vienna was going to continue to be the stronghold of the socialists in a largely conservative-governed nation. The socialist-led city government built the first Gemeindebauten for the working class, such as the Karl-Marx- Hof, Sandleitenhof, and the public housing estates on the G√ºrtel ring road, and instituted social, healthcare and educational reforms. These measures indeed ameliorated the living conditions for workers and raised their standard of living. This deepened the ties of workers towards the party and created a large pool of loyalists on whom the party could always depend, giving rise to the term \\"Rotes Wien\\" (Red Vienna) of the 1920s. The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 ‚Äì 1940. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 312 Within the grand coalition, the parties were able to agree on a package of reforms such as the 8-hour-day (8-Stunden-Tag), the worker's council law (Betriebsr√§tegesetz) and negotiations for a new republican constitution, which came into force on 10 November 1920. After the parliamentary elections in October 1920, the SDAP√ñ left the grand coalition after the CS won the majority of votes. The Socialists would remain in opposition during the First Republic. But the SDAP√ñ continued to be internally divided in roughly two wings: on the one side were the moderates under the leadership of former chancellor Karl Renner, who advocated a parliamentary, liberal democracy and the welfare state; on the other side were the more radical Austromarxists under the leadership of Otto Bauer. Especially the latter part did not wish any further cooperation with the CS, which led to an increase in political instability over time as political views became grew more extreme and fractious. Feeling increasingly under threat, most political parties formed their own military wings. In May 1924, the SDAP√ñ founded its own paramilitary wing, the Republikanischer Schutzbund (Republican Protection League). The Communist Party of Austria (KP√ñ) formed its Red Brigades and the conservative CS followed suit, founding its Heimwehr (Homeland Protection Force). The existence of armed political militias and vigilante groups, alongside the regular police and army forces, did not bode well for the stability of the young republic. The founding of these militias was a response to increased political tension, but also aggravated it, increasing the chances of open, violent clashes as political parties within parliament continued their fighting. On 3 November 1926, the so-called \\"Linzer Programm\\" was agreed upon at the SDAP√ñ party convention, which was heavily influenced by Otto Bauer's wing and reinforced the differences between the opposition Christian Social Party and the Social Democrats. Logo of the SDAP√ñ On 30 January 1927, members of the conservative Heimwehr shot at members of the Republikanischer Schutzbund in Schattendorf, resulting in two deaths. In the Schattendorfer Urteil trial that followed, the jury found the accused not guilty in July 1927. Members of the Republikanischer Schutzbund, the SDAP√ñ, and workers were outraged by this verdict and launched demonstrations on 15 July to protest. The mob vented its frustration, and eventually moved towards the Palace of Justice, setting it on fire. Clashes with the police left 85 workers and four policemen dead and up to 600 people were injured. The burning of the Palace of Justice and the bloodshed surrounding it symbolised a break within the republic, marking the coming end of democracy. The political atmosphere became increasingly poisoned and untenable. The conservatives shored their position against the Social Democrats, and on 18 May 1930 the Heimwehr of the CS issued its Korneuburger Eid (Oath of Korneuburg), in which it openly called for the overthrow of the parliamentary democracy (\\"Wir verwerfen den westlichen demokratischen Parlamentarismus und den Parteienstaat!\\")Brook-Shepherd, G. The Austrians. HarperCollins Publishers Ltd. London, 1995. , page 366 Both under the Austro- fascist dictatorship (1934‚Äì1938) and during the German occupation of Austria between 1938 and 1945, the SDAP√ñ was banned and persecuted heavily, but after liberation, the Social Democrats became a major political force in post-war Austria. During Austrofascism On 7 March 1933, parliament in effect shut itself down due to a minor technicality in the parliamentary procedures. During a vote impasse, the collective presidency of the lower house stepped down from office and in effect left the house without a speaker or chair. Federal Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss seized the opportunity to circumvent parliament and govern with a number of emergency decrees through an emergency powers act from 1917. Pressure was increased on the SDAP√ñ, political activities were increasingly curtailed, press censorship increased. The Social Democrats protested and rallied their forces in the worker's strongholds in Vienna, Linz, and other industrial areas and towns. Tension openly erupted on 12 February 1934, when the police entered the local party headquarters in Linz for a search. The socialist militia resisted the police force, and during the course of the week armed fighting broke out in Vienna and other SDAP√ñ strongholds such as industrial areas. The army was called in to crush the uprising in Vienna, shelling the Karl-Marx-Hof where members of the Schutzbund were holed up. The civil war lasted until 16 February, in the end the social- democratic movement was completely outlawed, most of the leadership arrested. The end of the civil war marked the definite end of the First Republic and the start of the Austro-fascist state under the leadership of Dollfuss. The crushing of the Social Democrats opposition by the conservatives however meant a further weakening of Austria, as infighting within the Heimwehr and the conservatives continued. Chancellor Dollfuss himself was assassinated 10 weeks after the end of the civil war by National socialists. Adolf Hitler was increasingly influencing political affairs in Austria. Nazi Germany was increasing the pressure by scheming and manipulating political events, as well as planning and carrying out terrorist attacks on infrastructure within Austria. The successor of Dollfuss, the conservative chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg, tried a new round of talks with the outlawed social-democrats and even the monarchists, in order to stabilise the situation again. The Socialists favoured democracy, but were lukewarm to the concept of an independent Austria. The majority of conservatives wanted to keep an independent Austria, however in the form of an Austro-fascist regime. The extreme fighting and enmity between the two parties resulted in both the abolition of democracy and the end of Austria as an independent entity. On 12 March 1938, the weakened Austrian government under Chancellor Schuschnigg was forced to step down by Hitler under the threat of war, and Austria was annexed into Nazi Germany. The Anschluss was initially enthusiastically greeted by many Social Democrats, such as the former chancellor Karl Renner who pledged to vote \\"yes\\" in a referendum on the Anschluss (\\"Ich stimme mit 'Ja'\\")Brook- Shepherd, G., The Austrians, page 455 and finally realise the old dream of a union with Germany. Although democracy was not in sight, at least Hitler's policies promised more work and equality for many workers and labourers, as well as further socialist reforms and political stability. During the beginning of the Second Republic The battle of Vienna between Soviet and Nazi forces was over on 13 April 1945. Immediately the party was refounded as the \\"Socialist Party of Austria\\" (Sozialistische Partei √ñsterreichs, SP√ñ). The first party chairman was Adolf Sch√§rf. After tyranny, war and destruction, the country had to be reconstructed while enduring hunger and deprivation. The traumatic experience under German rule brought a swing in domestic opinion away from Pan-Germanism and towards the idea of Austria as an independent, sovereign and democratic country. The two former enemies, the conservatives and the Socialists, put aside their differences in order to work towards the prosperity and renewed sovereignty of the country. Both sides entered into a grand coalition government that would last for the next 21 years until 1966. The Soviet Union had the most influence as an occupying allied power in the immediate post-war years. Joseph Stalin was interested in integrating the newly liberated Austria into the Soviet bloc. The Communist Party of Austria were the only party who could claim to have consistently fought against the Nazi regime, and they largely lay under the protection and guidance from Moscow. Any new Austrian government would therefore have to integrate them as well. Karl Renner tried to position himself as the man of the hour who could act as a bridge between the conservatives and the communists. The Soviets and the other allied powers had large reservations about Renner, whom they viewed as an opportunist. Renner tried to convince a sceptical Stalin in a letter, where he expressed his mea culpa for his previous support of the Anschluss, at the same presenting himself as the only credible Socialist politician left able to reach an agreement with the Communists.Brook-Shepherd, G., The Austrians, page 515 If Renner convinced Stalin, or if it was out of pure necessity, is not entirely clear, but the Soviets tentatively decided to support Renner, maybe in order to win more influence over the government in time. With Soviet support Karl Renner and Leopold Kunschak proclaimed a provisional Austrian state government on 27 April 1945 in the parliament building in Vienna. The proclamation aimed to re-establish an independent Austria. Historic photographs show Renner reading out the proclamation in the old imperial Chamber of the House of Representatives (Abgeordnetenhaus), with Soviet officers sitting in the back benches. This alarmed the western allies, who feared a plot by the Soviets to establish a people's republic, a tactic that worked in Hungary and East Germany, where the social democrats there were forcibly integrated with the communist party. However, for the moment, the Austrian socialists were allowed to re-establish their party and operate relatively freely. The new party also established their own newspaper, the \\"Arbeiter-Zeitung\\" on 4 August of the same year. Ex-chancellor Renner was elected as the new Federal President of Austria by the Federal Assembly on 20 October 1945. Renner would hold this office until his death on 31 December 1950. The party held its first congress since 1933 in December 1945. The SP√ñ decided to make its peace with the conservatives, since their fighting was partly responsible for the failure of the First Republic. The party entered an all encompassing grand coalition with the Austrian People's Party (√ñVP), the successor party of the old Christian Social Party. This form of a grand coalition would last for the next 21 years until 1966. After the death of Karl Renner in 1950, Theodor K√∂rner was elected as Federal President on 26 May 1951. In Frankfurt in Germany, the Socialist International was founded, of which the SP√ñ was one of the charter members. In May 1957 Bruno Pittermann became party chairman. Former chairman Adolf Sch√§rf was elected as Federal President in April 1957 and re-elected for a second term in 1963. He was succeeded in May 1965 by Franz Jonas, who also hailed from the socialist party. The grand coalition governments of SP√ñ and √ñVP were marked by a desire to stabilise the political and social situation and concentrate on economic growth and social equality. One of the first acts of the grand coalition was able to agree on a new law about worker's vacation regulations on 25 July 1946. The party followed a rather moderate line and tried to cooperate with its coalition partner. Many state enterprises were nationalised and the situation of the worker ameliorated with work incentives and social benefits. The neutrality that was required by Austria meant that the country had little to worry about military spending and obligations to any military block. Instead it tried to act as a mediator between two sides in any international conflict, concentrating on tasks within the United Nations framework. Nevertheless, on 4 January 1960, Foreign Minister Bruno Kreisky was able to sign the accession treaty of Austria into the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The Bruno Kreisky era In the parliamentary elections of April 1966, the √ñVP won a governmental majority and was thus able to rule alone. The Socialists left the grand coalition government, going into opposition. On 30 January 1967 Bruno Kreisky was elected as party chairman. In the National Council elections of March 1970, the SP√ñ won with a relative majority, but was only able to build a minority government that counted on support from the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ). This government was short-lived: new snap elections had to be held in October 1971. This time the SP√ñ was able to win the absolute majority in parliament. This ushered in a period of Socialist-led governments for the next 13 years, led by the charismatic Bruno Kreisky who would become one of the most important statesmen of the Second Republic. In June 1974, the SP√ñ-nominated candidate Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger won the 1974 presidential election. On the economic side, the 40-hour working week, a project by the SP√ñ, was passed in parliament and became law. The success of the economy and the international high-profile Austria was enjoying due to its neutrality ushered in another victory for Kreisky and the SP√ñ in the legislative election of May 1979, where the party won 51% of all votes. Nevertheless, the party failed to win another absolute majority in the following elections in April 1983. Kreisky stepped down and Fred Sinowatz became the new chancellor and formed a coalition government with the FP√ñ. Sinowatz later took over as party chairman from Kreisky in October of the same year. Sinowatz tried to rely on the liberal wing of the FP√ñ, however political infighting and the rise of the right-wing populist politician J√∂rg Haider to the chairmanship of the FP√ñ made a further coalition with its junior partner for the SP√ñ impossible. Franz Vranitzky, who replaced Sinowatz in June 1986, ended the so-called \\"small coalition\\" and called for fresh elections. In the November 1986 legislative election, the SP√ñ became strongest party again and entered into a grand coalition with the √ñVP. Vranitzky himself was elected as party chairman in May 1988. Second grand coalition phase with √ñVP SP√ñ party headquarters in Vienna The grand coalition government with the conservative √ñVP as the junior partner would last from 1988 until 2000. In July 1990, Bruno Kreisky, who was the grand doyen of the party, died. The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain confronted Austria and the SP√ñ with changing realities. In October of the same year, the party won and remained strongest party in parliament. In June 1991, the party congress decided to change its name from the \\"Socialist Party of Austria\\" to the \\"Social Democratic Party of Austria\\" (Sozialdemokratische Partei √ñsterreichs), thus shifting the emphasis from socialism to a reaffirmation to its commitment to social democracy. On issues of gender equality, the party congress decided in June 1993 to introduce a quota for women. The new regulation required that at least 40% of SP√ñ candidates are female. Chancellor Vranitzky tried to repair the damage to Austria's international image caused by the presidential election of the controversial Kurt Waldheim. He was the first chancellor who, in a speech in front of parliament, clearly spoke of the guilt Austrians carried during the Second World War, something that was until then a topic that was taboo at home. He undertook a number of steps towards reconciliation with victims, his state visit to Israel in 1983 was highly regarded. The SP√ñ also endorsed an entry of the country into the European Union during negotiations with Brussels. In the national referendum of 12 June 1994, over 66% percent of all voters voted \\"yes\\", Austria duly became a member of the European Union on 1 January 1995. Although the SP√ñ supported Austria's entry to the European Union, the party fared badly in the 1994 legislative election held in October 1994, but remained the strongest party in parliament. It was able to retain that position in the December elections of 1995 where it gained votes back. In 1997, Chancellor Vranitzky stepped back from office after more than 10 years in office to make way for the new generation, being replaced by his former Finance Minister Viktor Klima, who was sworn in during January. In April 1997 he also took over the position as party chairman. The party congress decided on a reformed party programme in October 1998. The basic values of social democracy, freedom, equality, justice and solidarity were reaffirmed. But the party also committed itself to modernisation and a willingness to take risks and welcome change. A new, more open party statute was passed. In order to reflect the new reforms, a new party logo was also introduced. Problems with Proporz The problem of the grand coalition in Austria was the continuation of the old Proporz system, where basically any political position as well as the civil service, trade unions and even positions in the economy and state businesses were occupied by either members of the two big parties. This system worked well in the post-war period, however with the end of the Cold War and Austria's entry to the EU, people's perceptions and opinions changed strongly. The old Proporz system, where basically the SP√ñ and the √ñVP would divide everything up between them, was increasingly seen as outdated and even undemocratic. Because both parties always had an absolute majority in parliament, no effective opposition could ever exist. The long period of grand coalitions lasted for over a decade, a period that was very unusual for any western, parliamentary democracy. As voters' frustration with the old system grew, the right-wing populist Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ) under the young and dynamic party chairman J√∂rg Haider was able to ride the wave of discontent and win votes in every parliamentary election. The FP√ñ had its core support with right-wing voters, but was increasingly able to attract voters from the conservative √ñVP and even made inroads with traditional SP√ñ voters who grew fed up with the grand coalitions and the old Proporz system. The 1999 legislative election was a great shock to the country's system. Although the SP√ñ lost votes, it was still able to retain its position as the strongest party, but the FP√ñ became the second strongest party by a very small margin ahead of the √ñVP. Although federal president Thomas Klestil gave the Social Democrats the order to form a new government, no coalition partner could be found. The √ñVP under their leader Wolfgang Sch√ºssel, who was Vice-Chancellor of Austria and Foreign Minister, entered into negotiations with the FP√ñ instead. In February 2000, the new right-wing coalition government between the √ñVP and the FP√ñ was formed with Sch√ºssel as the new chancellor. This prompted a huge outcry at home as well as abroad, leading even to sanctions by the EU and Israel pulling out its ambassador in protest against the far-right FP√ñ. For the first time in 30 years, the SP√ñ had to sit in opposition. New role as opposition party and return to power SP√ñ poster for the 2006 general elections; \\"The country needs a new fairness.\\" The end of the grand coalition left many within the √ñVP embittered with their party and its perceived sell-out. Alfred Gusenbauer became new party chairman and started restructuring the party politically, organisationally and financially. In the snap elections of November 2002 the party lost its position as strongest party to the conservative √ñVP, which won a resounding victory at the expense of the Social Democrats and the FP√ñ. The SP√ñ got 36.5% of the votes, ending up with 69 seats in the National Council. It had 23 seats in the Federal Council. Nevertheless, in a number of state elections, the SP√ñ won an increased number of votes and even made inroads in traditionally conservative-ruled states. Outside its traditional strongholds of Vienna and Burgenland, the party surprisingly won state elections in Styria and Salzburg, forming the new state governments there. SP√ñ candidate Heinz Fischer won the presidential elections in April 2004 against √ñVP contender Benita Ferrero- Waldner. Thus an √ñVP-led government stood opposite a Social Democrat president. President Fischer repeatedly made statements that stood in contrast to the official stance of the government, such as the speaking out for the equality of homosexuals as well as calling for better treatment of immigrants. In June 2004, the SP√ñ fared well in the 2004 European elections, winning 33.5% of the Austrian votes cast and receiving nine seats (out of a total of 18 Austrian seats) and becoming the strongest Austrian party. This was seen as a welcome sign for the upcoming 2006 legislative election. Due to the banking scandal of the BAWAG, which was close to the unions, confidence has been greatly shaken that the party will separate financial dealings from politics. In the 2006 National Elections the SP√ñ, to the surprise of many, became Austria's strongest party with 68 seats (67 plus the chairman of the Liberal Forum running on the SP√ñ electoral list) to the √ñVP's 66. In the long protracted coalition negotiations that followed, a grand coalition was formed with the √ñVP, with Gusenbauer as Chancellor. The government was finally sworn in January 2007, three months after the elections. See also *Independent Social Democratic Party (Czech Lands) References =Literature= * Gordon Brook-Shepherd.

The title is taken from Psalms and means ‚ÄúA Joyous Mother of Children‚Äù. The Book Teichtal grew up as a staunch anti-Zionist Chasid of the Munkatsher Rebbe. However, during the Holocaust, Rabbi Teichtal changed his position from the one he espoused in his youth. The physical product of that introspection is the book, Eim HaBanim Semeicha, in which he specifically retracts his previous viewpoints, and argues that the true redemption can only come if the Jewish people unite and rebuild the land of Israel. Many of his coreligionists viewed the book with skepticism, some going so far as to ban Rabbi Teichtal from their synagogues. In the book, Rabbi Teichtal strongly criticizes the Haredim for not supporting the settlement of the Land of Israel. When it was written, it was a scathing criticism of the Jewish Orthodox establishment, and Agudat Israel in particular. He writes: > It is clear that he who prepares prior to the Sabbath will eat on the > Sabbath (Avodah Zarah, 3a), and since the Haredim did not toil, they have > absolutely no influence in the Land (of Israel). Those who toil and build > have the influence, and they are the masters of the Land. It is, therefore, > no wonder that they are in control... Now, what will the Haredim say?

Brading's first book, Miners and Merchants in Bourbon Mexico 1765‚Äì1810 was published in 1971. It dealt with the general history of the silver industry in Mexico with a comprehensive study of Guanajuato and its mines, population and leading families. A review in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science called it \\"landmark of dissertation research and organization\\" while Fernand Braudel who is considered one of the greatest of the modern historians found it a \\"fascinating book\\". It won the Bolton Prize in 1972 In 1973, Brading returned to Cambridge University as a University Lecturer in Latin American History and become Director of the Centre of Latin American Studies at Cambridge University from 1975 ‚Äì 1990. He was a fellow of St Edmund's College from 1975‚Äì1988. In 1991 a LittD was awarded to Brading and he was made Reader in Latin American History at Cambridge University. The following year he was the Leverhulme Research Fellow in Mexico, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Lima in Peru. and was elected membership of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts of which he is one of only ten British members in the humanities, the others being Roger Scruton, Richard Overy , Norman Davies and Timothy Garton Ash among others. In 1999, Brading was made Professor in Latin American History at Cambridge University. Works In 1992, Brading's book The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492‚Äì1867 was published. Its central thesis was that Spaniards born in the New World (creoles) had an American cultural identity, a creole consciousness, distinct from those born and raised in Spain (peninsulares). A review in the journal History declared it to be a book of major importance on the topic, as did a review in the Journal of Latin American Studies. The Mexican literary magazine Letras Libres \\"said it occupies a place of honor in the library of neophytes and scholars.\\" In 2001, Brading published Mexican Phoenix, Our Lady of Guadalupe: Image and Tradition across Five Centuries, a detailed history of the most important religious icon in Latin America ‚Äì the Virgin of Guadalupe. Foreign Affairs magazine commented in a review saying that it was \\"brilliant\\"... and having \\" remarkable insight\\" [13] Festschrift In 2007 a Festschrift was published in his honour, entitled Mexican Soundings: Essays in Honour of David A. Brading. The Hispanic American Historical Review in a review of the book said \\"Brading's contributions to Mexican history are equaled by few and exceeded by none.\\" while an essay by Eric Van Young praised Brading as the \\" leading scholar of intellectual history and the Catholic Church for colonial Mexico.\\" Contributors included Alan Knight , Enrique Florescano, Eric Van Young, Susan Deans-Smith, Ellen Gunnarsd√≥ttir, Brian Hamnett, Marta Eugenia Garc√≠a Ugarte, and Guy P.C.

In her later years she made a new career for herself in the world of the arts, and as a painter of Na√Øve art. Life Marianne was born in Cologne a few months after the outbreak of the First World War. After leaving school she trained as a legal assistant. When she was 15 she joined the Rote Falken, a youth group for the children of socialist leaning families. Three years later, on 1 November 1932, she joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Less than a year later, the Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost little time in converting the German state into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity (unless in support of the Nazi party) became illegal. Marianne was already involved with Heinz K√ºhn, who had already also been involved in the Rote Falken. He was a railway worked who helda position of some prominence in the SPD locally, and whom she would marry in 1939. Rejecting the reassurances of friends that things would return to normality within a few months of the Nazi power grab, the two of them emigrated to Belgium from where they continued to work against the German Nazi Party. After the war ended, she returned to Cologne with her husband, remaining politically engaged. With her husband and Susanne Miller she was a co-founder of the Socialist Education Association (Sozialistischen Bildungsgemeinschaft ) in Cologne. Between 1952 and 1973 she was a city councillor, representing the Dellbr√ºck district of Cologne, where she had her home along the Roteichenweg. It was nevertheless her husband who had the more stellar political career. Heinz K√ºhn served as the regional prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1966 till 1978. In 1979 Marianne K√ºhn opened a small art gallery at the couple's home in the Cologne garden suburb of Dellbr√ºck. It was described as a \\"Naive-Kunst- Galerie\\" and the focus was on Na√Øve art. She presented 65 exhibitions of art from across the world, including pieces from Eastern Europe, Israel, Ethiopia, Argentina, China and Tanzania, but at the centre was a core of around 250 exhibitors from the historic German lands. She also produced paintings herself and built up her own art collection. After her home city had rejected her offer to donate her collection to Cologne, in 2003 Marianne K√ºhn gifted her collection of approximately 650 pieces to the Vestische Museum in nearby Recklinghausen.

The primary individual behind the Tel-musici was inventor George R. Webb. In January 1908, while soliciting for investors, he arranged a demonstration of the concept at a Baltimore hotel, where listeners telephoned a remote location with their requests, which were played back as \\"'10 cents' worth of Lohengrin,' or 'a quarter's worth of ragtime'\\" to the assembled participants.\\"Melody by 'Phone\\", Baltimore Sun, January 26, 1908, page 20. Shortly thereafter, a Tel-musici company with a capitalization of $10,000 was incorporated in the state of Delaware by \\"a number of Baltimorians\\".\\"Telmusici Co. Incorporated\\", Music Trade Review, February 1, 1908, page 29 (arcade-museum.com) In 1909 an operating Tel-musici system was established in Wilmington, Delaware with George Webb as the company president, and J. J. Comer the general manager. The music rooms' musical library was described as comprehensive and \\"embracing a complete line of all the latest productions\\". The charge was three cents for each requested standard tune, and seven cents for grand opera. Subscribers were required to guarantee purchases totaling $18 per year. Provisions were also made for transmitting a general program in lieu of individual requests. The promoters hoped to interest local telephone companies in installing their own Tel-musici operations. The Wilmington operation was later taken over by the Wilmington and Philadelphia Traction Co., which operated a Wilmington telephone franchise, and an advertisement for a Tel-musici \\"dance music program\\" appeared as late as 1914.\\"Last and Best April Dance Program\\" (advertisement), Wilmington (Delaware) Morning Star, April 26, 1914, page 9. However, it does not appear that any additional installations became operational. In 1912, George Webb began promoting the similarly conceived Magnaphone system, established in New York City, which was intended to transmit recording and other audio offerings to subscribers for eight dollars a month.\\"Something Really New‚ÄîThe Magnaphone\\", Popular Electricity, December 1912, pages 808-810. The New York Magnaphone and Music Company was granted a twenty-five year franchise for operations \\"in the Borough of Manhattan and that part of the Borough of The Bronx west of the Bronx River\\", however, the franchise was never built. J. J. Comer would later participate, in conjunction with the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago, with development of the Musolaphone system, which briefly operated in southside Chicago, and which transmitted live news and entertainment to subscribing homes and businesses over telephone lines.\\"Increasing the Revenue Producing Efficiency of a Plant\\" by Stanley R.

The cave was inhabited by humans (cro-magnon) before the year 10,000 BC. Due to the collapse of the rock, the original entrance to the cave was sealed thousands of years ago, which made it possible for preservation of objects, tools and wall paintings that were discovered in 1968. Based on those objects found in the cave, it is known that there was a significant human presence during the Magdalenian culture of the Upper Palaeolithic, but the cave was probably inhabited before that time. Entrance to the cave The Tito Bustillo Cave has been designated a World Heritage Site, as part of the Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain, and it counts with 12 prehistorical paintings, making it one of the most complete examples of the prehistoric art in the north of Spain. The oldest of these paintings shows human figures and is around 33,000 years old, as determined by radiocarbon dating. Some scientists believe it could have been made by Neanderthals, though this theory hasn't been proven. Some of the paintings represent animals: horses, deer, moose and even a marine animal (probably a whale) http://www.centrotitobustillo.com/es/2/la-cueva/23/el-arte-rupestre-de-la- cueva-de-tito-bustillo.html and they are believed to have had some kind of ritual purpose to improve their hunting. There is also a panel representing female genitalia and it is believed to have had the intention to invoke fertility. The oldest painting in the cave represents an anthropomorphic figure, part male, part female. Apart from the paintings, some objects from the Magdalenian period were perfectly preserved. The most important ones are some harpoons made of bone and a carved staghorn of a goat head.

He took office in 2016 after winning the most votes in the 2016 election, 71,356 (39.1%). He was reelected in 2020 with 92.2% of the vote. A historian, Gu√∞ni was a docent at the University of Iceland before running for president in 2016. His field of research is modern Icelandic history, and he has published works on the Cod Wars, the 2008‚Äì2011 Icelandic financial crisis and the Icelandic presidency, among other topics. Early life and education Gu√∞ni is the son of teacher and journalist Margr√©t Thorlacius and sports instructor J√≥hannes S√¶mundsson. His brother Patrekur J√≥hannesson is a former Icelandic handball national team player. Gu√∞ni played handball in his youth, in both Iceland and the UK. Gu√∞ni graduated from Menntask√≥linn √≠ Reykjav√≠k (MR), a junior college in central Reykjav√≠k, in 1987. While at MR, he competed in Gettu betur, an Icelandic team quiz show for junior college students. He earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science from the University of Warwick in England in 1991 and a Master of Arts in history from the University of Iceland in 1997. He has also studied German and Russian at university level. In 1999, he completed an MSt degree in history at St Antony's College at the University of Oxford. In 2003, he received a PhD in history from Queen Mary, University of London. Career Gu√∞ni has worked as a lecturer at the University of Iceland, Bifr√∂st University and University of London. At the time of his presidential candidacy he worked as a senior lecturer in history at the University of Iceland. His field of research is modern Icelandic history, in which he has published a number of works, including on the Cod Wars, the 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis and the Icelandic presidency. He has written a biography of Gunnar Thoroddsen and a book about Kristj√°n Eldj√°rn's presidency. Between 1992 and 1997, he translated four works by Stephen King into Icelandic. From 2011 to 2015, Gu√∞ni was president of S√∂guf√©lag, the Icelandic historical society. =Presidential candidacy= Gu√∞ni giving a talk in September 2016. Gu√∞ni decided to stand for president on 5 May 2016. Before his candidacy, he had appeared frequently on live television to provide commentary and historical context in the wake of the publication of the Panama Papers, which created a scandal for Icelandic prime minister Sigmundur Dav√≠√∞ Gunnlaugsson and ultimately led to his ouster. A scholar of the Icelandic presidency, Gu√∞ni delineated on live television the options available to incumbent president √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson and other Icelandic political actors. After his television appearances, there were calls for Gu√∞ni to run for the presidency himself. His platform included support for a citizen initiative referendum provision in the Constitution. Early polls showed significant support, and following incumbent president √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson's decision to drop out of the race Gu√∞ni saw an increase in popularity reflected in various polls, which ranked him first with 67% to 69%, far ahead of other contenders. Gu√∞ni was elected on 25 June after receiving a plurality of 39.1% of the vote. Gu√∞ni was unaffiliated with any of Iceland's political parties. He said he would be a \\"less political president\\" than his predecessor due to a lack of partisanship. Gu√∞ni has emphasized the importance of unity for the small nation. = President of Iceland = Gu√∞ni with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Arkhangelsk, Russia, 2017 Gu√∞ni took office as President of Iceland on 1 August 2016. At 48, he was Iceland's youngest president. Roughly one month into his term, Gu√∞ni had approval ratings of 68,6% in an MMR survey, the highest approval rating this pollster has measured for an Icelandic president since its establishment in 2011. Early in his term, Gu√∞ni had to oversee negotiations to form a government in Iceland in the wake of the 2016 Icelandic parliamentary election on 29 October. These negotiations were difficult, as no pre-election coalition had a majority, and all possible majority coalitions had parties with highly divergent policy positions. In December 2016, Gu√∞ni had approval ratings of 97%. Such high approval ratings for Icelandic politicians are without precedent. In April 2019, his approval rating was 93,5% among those who took a position in a survey. Gu√∞ni attracted international attention in February 2017 when he jokingly vowed to ban pineapple as a pizza topping. Personal life =Religious beliefs= Gu√∞ni stands outside organized religion, but was raised in the Catholic faith. He left the Catholic Church due to its delayed and muted response to reports of criminal abuses by priests. His credo is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\"human beings are born free, equal in dignity and rights. Humans are endowed with reason and conscience and should act in the spirit of brotherhood towards each other.\\" =Family= Gu√∞ni is the son of the teacher and journalist Margr√©t Thorlacius and the physical education teacher and coach J√≥hannes S√¶mundsson. His father died of cancer at age 42.

AEGIS campaigned to improve the care of older people in long-stay wards of National Health Service (NHS) psychiatric hospitals. In 1967, Robb compiled Sans Everything: A Case to Answer, a controversial book detailing the inadequacies of care provided for older people, which prompted a nationwide scandal. Although initially official inquiries into these allegations reported that they were \\"totally unfounded or grossly exaggerated\\",'Sans Everything (Reports of Inquiries)' Hansard HC Deb 09 July 1968 vol 768 cc213‚Äì6, 214 her campaigns led to revealing of other instances of ill treatment which were accepted and prompted the government to implement NHS policy changes.Anon, 'Disturbing report on a hospital: health authorities to be asked to review standards of care' Times, 16 May 1974, 16  Early life  Born into a landed Roman Catholic recusant family in Yorkshire, Barbara Anne had a privileged early life, a convent education, and attended finishing school in Kensington, London. She danced with the Vic-Wells company,Anon, 'The patients' campaigner', Hampstead and Highgate Express, 25 June 1976 the forerunner of the Royal Ballet, but an ankle injury ended her dancing career. Instead, she studied theatre and stage design at the Chelsea School of Art. At Chelsea she met Brian Robb, an artist, cartoonist and illustrator. They married in 1937.Anon, 'Burghwallis Hall Wedding: granddaughter of Major ELS Anne' Yorkshire Post, 22 July 1937 Robb's grandfather, Major Ernest Charlton Anne (1852‚Äì1939) inspired her humanitarian outlook. Robb recalled his words many years later: \\"when you see somebody needing help ‚Äì help him\\" and \\"wherever there were nettles there were sure to be dock leaves to cure the sting [...] Remember that everything in life is like the nettles, there are always dock leaves if only you look hard enough.\\"Anne Allen, 'One woman who refused to pass by..'

Robb undertook a \\"remarkable self-analysis\\",White to Jung, 19 January 1947, in Ann Lammers, Adrian Cunningham (eds) The Jung-White Letters (London: Routledge, 2007) 68 and mainly taught herself the techniques of the discipline. White corresponded and collaborated with Carl Jung. Letters between them refer to Robb's dreams and their interpretation, her personality and appearance; Jung wrote, \\"She decidedly leaves you guessing\\", and that she was \\"an eyeful and beyond!\\"Jung to White, 21 September 1951, Lammers and Cunningham, Jung-White, 168‚Äì169 White called her \\"quite a corker\\" and did not quite know how to \\"deal with\\" her.White to Jung, 7 October 1951, Lammers and Cunningham, Jung-White, 169‚Äì170 Until 1965, Robb practised as a psychotherapist. She and Brian lived in a small cottage in Hampstead, each of the three floors measuring little more than 2.5-by-3.5 metres. They wanted children, but had none. They had a good social life, including in the company of artists and politicians, often left- wing, and holidayed in Venice, where Brian painted. Robb enjoyed fashionable clothes and hats; C.H. Rolph wrote in his memoir, \\"Even if it were possible to forget Barbara, it would not be possible to forget those extraordinary, carefully chosen, and obviously expensive hats, with which she seemed to transmute every occasion into a kind of one-woman Ascot.\\"CH Rolph, Further Particulars (Oxford: OUP, 1987) 183  Visit to Friern Hospital, 1965  Friern Hospital in 2008 (now renovated as private housing) White introduced Amy Gibbs (1891‚Äì1967) to Robb in 1943, for psychotherapy. Gibbs was well for the next 20 years. She worked as a seamstress, and took up art in retirement. In late 1963, Gibbs was admitted to Friern Hospital, a psychiatric institution. She expected a short admission to sort out her medication which was making her feel \\"muzzy\\".Robb, Sans Everything, 69 In December 1964, a mutual friend informed Robb that Gibbs was still in Friern, on a long-stay 'back ward' and wanted to see her. On her first visit in January 1965, Robb was shocked by what she saw and heard on the ward: the patients' uniform haircuts, no activities, institutional clothing, lack of personal possessions including spectacles, dentures and hearing aids, and harshness from the nurses.Robb, Sans Everything, 69‚Äì72 Robb began \\"Diary of a Nobody\\",Robb, Sans Everything, 69‚Äì112 a diary of her visits to ensure that she accurately recorded them, as \\"I felt that I would never have another really easy moment unless I did everything I could to try to right this situation.\\"  AEGIS (1965‚Äìc.1975)  Within months Robb established AEGIS, which became one of the country's most determined pressure groups.Anne Robinson, 'Whitewash in the old folks' wards' Sunday Times, 5 April 1970 It was small, elite and high profile, using the media to create publicity. Its team of advisors and active supporters included Brian Abel-Smith; CH Rolph; Audrey Harvey; David Kenworthy, 11th Baron Strabolgi; psychiatrists Russell Barton, Anthony Whitehead and David Enoch; nurses with senior roles at the Royal College of Nursing; and others when needed. Strabolgi ensured that a copy of 'Diary of a Nobody' reached the Minister of Health, Kenneth Robinson, who said he would investigate ‚Äì but nothing happened.Robb, Sans Everything 91, 97 Robb was passionate about her chosen cause, and worked incessantly to achieve improvement in the long-stay wards. Her cottage became AEGIS's headquarters. She described her campaign style as aggressive: \\"I'm better suited to Walls of Jericho than to Trojan Horse tactics.\\"Anon, 'The patients' campaigner', Hampstead and Highgate Express, 25 June 1976 The Sunday Times described her extraordinary drive and her punishing schedule‚Äîtwelve hours a day, six days a week‚Äîincluding acting as counsellor to \\"hundreds of distressed nurses\\"Sunday Times, 12 November 1972 and responding personally to a constant stream of correspondence. Through her unrelenting determination and her contacts with the press, according to Richard Crossman (the Secretary of State for Health and Social Services 1968‚Äì70), Robb achieved the reputation of being \\"a terrible danger\\" to the Government, a \\"bomb\\" which it \\"had to defuse.\\"Richard Crossman, The Diaries of a Cabinet Minister Vol 3. (London: Hamilton and Cape, 1977) 727  Sans Everything  = Sans Everything and its reception (1967) = AEGIS published Sans Everything in 1967. Chapters by nurses and social workers, together with Robb's 'Diary of a Nobody', described scandalous inhumane and inadequate care in long-stay wards in seven hospitals. Wards were over-crowded and under-staffed. Undignified and unkind practices included: rough handling, teasing, slapping, swearing at patients and rushed 'production-line' bathing of over 40 elderly and frail patients in a single morning. There was little, if any, privacy, including for personal care. Bed time could be as early as 5 pm. Some wards were locked and un-staffed at night, with senior staff disregarding the risks, for example, of fire. There was lack of medical attention, and usually no attempt at rehabilitation. Staff were rarely deliberately cruel, but harsh, disrespectful and patronizing nursing practices, especially for older people, were accepted by staff as standard. The practices often evolved from attempts to devise time-saving methods to get through the workload and manage large numbers of patients in overcrowded environments, or were due to ignorance of modern psychiatric and geriatric treatment and care. Widespread, excessively pessimistic, stereotypic understanding of inevitable and hopeless chronic decline in old age, pervaded and contributed to staff negativity. Staff who complained or wanted to change practices were accused of being disloyal, and could be victimized to the point of resigning or being dismissed from their posts. Sans Everything proposed remedies, including: specialist psychiatric services to treat, rehabilitate and support mentally unwell older people, based on the model practised at Severalls Hospital in Colchester, which prevented admission and enabled discharge;Anthony Whitehead, 'A comprehensive psychogeriatric service' Lancet, 1965, ii, 583‚Äì586 building homes for rent on surplus land around the psychiatric hospitals to generate income for the NHS to pay for better services and accommodation for older people;AEGIS, Project 70 (London: AEGIS, 1966) and ways of monitoring to ensure high standards, through improved NHS complaints procedures, a hospital ombudsman and an inspectorate.Abel-Smith, Robb, Peter Thomson, Anthony Whitehead in Sans Everything, 116‚Äì135 Discussion at the Ministry did not lead to action.Claire Hilton 'Developing psychogeriatrics in England: a turning point in the 1960s?' Contemporary British History, 2016, 30, 40‚Äì72, 47 Doi:10.1080/13619462.2015.1049263 Throughout AEGIS' campaign, health service staff, politicians, patients and their relatives, the media and the wider public, responded in diverse ways. These ranged from absolute endorsement of the allegations of bad practice, such as by the pressCH Rolph, 'Whiter-than-white paper' New Statesman, 19 July 1968 and most relatives of patients, to absolute rejection, most apparent in higher tiers of NHS administration.Maurice Hackett, 'Hospitals: we are experts' Sunday Times, 23 July 1967; 'Sans Everything (Reports of Inquiries)' Hansard HC Deb 09 July 1968 vol 768 cc213‚Äì6 AEGIS struggled to convince the Ministry of Health and the regional hospital boards (RHBs), which managed the hospitals, about the happenings in them. Robinson publicly criticized the book, and announced on the BBC television news programme 24 Hours that he was sure poor-care was almost non-existent and that investigations would demonstrate that. The press criticized Robinson \\"who to his shame, seemed to pooh-pooh\\" the allegations. = Inquiries into the allegations = Robinson asked the RHBs with responsibility for the hospitals in Sans Everything to establish committees of inquiry. These committees adopted various tactics during their investigations which were out of keeping with government recommendations.Council on Tribunals, Annual Report: 1968, page 13‚Äì14, and 1969, page 4 These included: discrediting Sans Everything evidence as false, unreliable or exaggerated, based on their assessment of the witnesses' personality; using leading questions; accepting that practices were correct because that was how they were always done; and justifying their decisions based on comments by senior staff who they were judging, rather than using independent sources about best psychiatric and geriatric practice. The committees demonstrated their assumptions, about the excellence of nursing care and that the NHS was \\"the best health service in the world\\",'Mental health service' Hansard HC Deb 19 March 1965 vol 708 cc1645‚Äì719, 1656 and they held excessively negative ideas about older people and mental illness.DHSS Findings and Recommendations 22, 31, 37 They also appeared unaware of the rigid and self-defensive administrative and nursing hierarchies in the psychiatric hospitals and that complainants could be victimised.Anon, 'Editorial' Nursing Mirror, 24 January 1969; Tommy Dickinson, Curing Queers': mental nurses and their patients, 1935‚Äì1974 (Manchester University Press: Manchester, 2015) The committees lacked professional experience of investigating government appointed Boards which had neglected their responsibilities to the detriment of the population they served (such as at Aberfan, 1966). Some committees ignored, or were unaware of, current guidance about NHS complaints management. The Council on Tribunals, the public body set up to ensure fair inquiries, criticized Robinson's handling of the Sans Everything allegations.Council on Tribunals, Annual Report 1968, 13‚Äì14; Anon, 'Sans Everything' New Law Journal, 17 July 1969 The inquiries made 48 general recommendations, but did not uphold the specific allegations in Sans Everything. Robinson published the inquiry reports as a White PaperMinistry of Health, Findings and Recommendations Following Enquiries into Allegations Concerning the Care of Elderly Patients in Certain Hospitals Cmnd. 3687 (London: HMSO, 1968) and announced, in the House of Commons, that the allegations were \\"totally unfounded or grossly exaggerated\\" and that the committees reported \\"very favourably on the standard of care provided.\\"Sans Everything (Reports of Inquiries)' Hansard HC Deb 09 July 1968 vol 768 cc213‚Äì6, 214 An in-depth study of the White Paper showed that Robinson's interpretation was incorrect, verging on deceitful.CH Rolph, 'Whiter-than- white paper' New Statesman, 19 July 1968 Crossman recorded in his diary, that Robinson thought that his dealing with Sans Everything would silence Robb, and that his handling of Sans Everything was 'retaliation' against her.Richard Crossman, The Diaries of a Cabinet Minister. Vol 3. (London: Hamilton and Cape, 1977) 134 This fitted with the observation of Max Beloff, Professor of Government and Public Administration at Oxford, that \\"most inquiries are so manned that they turn out to be nothing but the system looking at itself, and finding more to admire than to blame.\\" Max Beloff, 'Defining the limits of official responsibility' Times, 11 September 1967, 9 = Other scandals revealed as a result of Sans Everything = In response to publicity about Sans Everything, staff in several other psychiatric hospitals made allegations of similar sorts of ill-treatment. A World in Action television documentary about Powick Hospital, Ward F13, exposed undignified batch-living of 78 elderly women on one Nightingale ward with over-worked nurses.World in Action, Ward F13, Granada Television, 21 May 1968 There was \\"smouldering discontent\\" among the nursing students at Whittingham Hospital, Lancashire, but the senior nurses ignored their concerns.DHSS, Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Whittingham Hospital Cmnd. 4861 (London: HMSO, 1972) An employee at South Ockendon Hospital, Essex, anonymously sent Robb pages torn from a ward report book, describing severe injuries probably inflicted by staff on a patient. Robb's personal involvement and persistence was recognized by Barbara Castle (Secretary of State for Health and Social Services 1974‚Äì6). The sender's action pointed to Robb's reputation for dealing with serious NHS complaints, and emphasized the need for an official, independent authority, e.g. an ombudsman, who staff could approach directly. Other disturbing reports emerged, including deaths of patients at Farleigh Hospital, Bristol, and the convictions of three ward staff for manslaughter.DHSS, Report of the Farleigh Hospital Committee of Inquiry Cmnd. 4557 (London: HMSO, 1974) A report about Sans Everything by David Roxan in the News of the World triggered letters of concern from staff and former staff about other hospitals.David Roxan, '‚ÄúOld folk beaten in hospital‚Äù allegation' News of the World, 25 June 1967 Roxan forwarded them to the Ministry. One concerned Ely Hospital, Cardiff. The Welsh Hospital Board set up a committee of inquiry into conditions at Ely chaired by Geoffrey Howe. Howe had recently represented the Coal Board managers at the inquiry into the Aberfan disaster, so had experience of an inquiry into neglect in the public sector. Howe conducted the Ely Inquiry rigorously, and avoided the biased processes of the Sans Everything inquiries.Geoffrey Howe, 'The management of public inquiries' Political Quarterly, 1999, 70, 295‚Äì304 He meticulously weighed all the evidence from the whistle-blower, nursing auxiliary Michael Pantelides. The committee upheld most of Pantelides' allegations, which were similar to those in Sans Everything, including ill- treatment of patients, victimization of staff who complained and inadequate hospital management. Howe wanted his full report published. Crossman (Robinson had since left the Ministry of Health), fearful of Howe's legal skills and Robb's relationship with the press,Richard Crossman, The Diaries of a Cabinet Minister. Vol 3. (London: Hamilton and Cape, 1977) 727 agreed. The day Crossman revealed the Ely Inquiry findings in the Commons, he also announced plans to establish an NHS hospitals' inspectorate to help ensure higher standards.'Ely Hospital, Cardiff' Hansard HC Deb 27 March 1969 vol 780 cc1808‚Äì20 The Ely Inquiry, along with those at Farleigh, Whittingham and South Ockendon,DHSS, Report of the Committee of Inquiry into South Ockendon Hospital HC 124 (London: HMSO, 1974) vindicated Robb and Sans Everything, although the NHS authorities made no public apology. Sans Everything faded from the agenda and from history, while the other inquiries, especially Ely, achieved highly regarded status.Charles Webster, The National Health Service: a political history (Oxford: OUP, 1998) 80  Outcomes, death and legacy  Creating NHS policy was, and is, complex. Robb and AEGIS could not make changes independently, but they undoubtedly influenced them. Robb continued to exert pressure on the government to implement proposals, through the press, Members of Parliament, peers including Lord Strabolgi and directly into the DHSS (Department of Health and Social Security) via Abel-Smith. Crossman was keener than Robinson to remedy deficits in the long-stay hospitals. In 1969, Crossman established the Hospital Advisory Service (HAS), an inspectorate.DHSS, National Health Service Hospital Advisory Service: initial plan of operation HM (70)17 (London: HMSO, 1970) (The Care Quality Commission is the 2016 incarnation.) The HAS linked to proposals in Sans Everything.Abel-Smith in Sans Everything, 135 Crossman, with Howe, Abel-Smith, Robb, Peter Townsend, Bea Serota and some others made a powerful case for making improvements and allocating more funds to the long-stay hospitals. The DHSS also produced 'blueprints,' in conjunction with NHS clinical staff, for future developments. These contributed to improving services for people with mental illnessDHSS, 'Hospital Services for the Mentally Ill' HM(71)97 (London: HMSO, 1971) and 'mental handicap,'DHSS, Better Services for the Mentally Handicapped (London: HMSO, 1971) and for older people.DHSS, Services for Mental Illness Related to Old Age HM(72)71 (London: HMSO, 1972) Other changes linked to Robb's work took place, some under successive governments. They included: triggering other revelations of ill-treatment and pressurizing the government to establish inquiries into them; the first review of complaints procedures in the history of the NHS (1971‚Äì3);DHSS, Report of the Committee on Hospital Complaint Procedures (Chair: Sir Michael Davies) (London: HMSO, 1973) the NHS Ombudsman (1973) and the DHSS' first guidance on preventing violence in hospitals (1976).DHSS, The Management of Violent or Potentially Violent Hospital Patients HC (76)11 (London: HMSO, 1976) Other pressure groups followed AEGIS' style and adopted more assertive methods by using the media to shift public opinion and bring pressure to bear on the government.National Association for Mental Health, Annual Report, 1968‚Äì9, 'The whole truth', 5‚Äì7 Sans Everything also linked to campaigns to improve nurses' education and conditions of employmentAnon, 'Tug of war at nurses' Commons protest' Daily Telegraph, 14 December 1968 and to the development of the new specialty of 'old age psychiatry,' taking a proactive and rehabilitation approach to mental illnesses in older people.M David Enoch, John Howells, The Organisation of Psychogeriatrics (Ipswich: SCP, 1971); Claire Hilton 'Developing psychogeriatrics in England: a turning point in the 1960s?'

Although her diary began to fill a few months later, the campaign never regained its full strength. Robb died at home in Hampstead on 21 June 1976. A memorial stone with her name (and later her husband's) is in the family cemetery at Burghwallis, Yorkshire.

Kl√∂ckner's core business is the sale of steel and non-ferrous metals. With an established distribution network and some 160 locations, the Group serves more than 100,000 customers in 13 countries.  Group structure  Kl√∂ckner & Co operates in 13 countries around the world. Its business activities are supervised by the Management Board and the corporate departments of its holding company in Duisburg, and carried out by the country organizations. The Kl√∂ckner & Co Group comprises the following companies:  Business model  The Kl√∂ckner & Co Group's value chain ranges from procurement and warehousing through a wealth of services all the way to trade and distribution. Kl√∂ckner & Co also offers its customers consulting services for warehousing, processing and logistics. The international distributor operates independently of production. Hailing for the most part from the construction industry as well as machinery and mechanical engineering, Kl√∂ckner & Co's customers span the arc from small and medium-sized companies to major international corporations. In addition, the Group supplies intermediate products for the automotive, shipbuilding and consumer goods industries. Kl√∂ckner & Co plans to digitalize its supply and service chain throughout pushing ahead with the introduction of an independent open industry platform, which is to become the leading vertical platform for the steel and metal industry.  Market and competitors  In the North American market, Kl√∂ckner & Co's chief competitors are Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. and Ryerson Inc., both domiciled in the US, and Russel Metals Inc. in Canada. Major European competitors are the BE Group in Sweden along with the distribution arms of steel producers Salzgitter AG, Germany; Tata Steel, UK; ArcelorMittal, Netherlands; and ThyssenKrupp, Germany.  Products and services  The company's product portfolio is divided into the segments long products (steel beams for the construction industry), flat products (sheet for mechanical engineering companies), hollow section (structural hollow section), stainless and quality steel (high-alloyed round steel bars for machine building), aluminum (aluminum sectional rods for plant construction) and special products, such as plastics, ironware and accessories. Kl√∂ckner & Co offers a total of over 200,000 products. Alongside unprocessed materials and intermediate products, the Kl√∂ckner & Co Group provides services such as cutting and splitting steel strip, cutting to length, flame cutting and surface treatment.  History  On June 28, 1906, the merchant Peter Kl√∂ckner set up the Kl√∂ckner & Co trading company in Duisburg. The company soon joined the ranks of Germany's largest steel distributors, with numerous branch offices and a broad array of products. Trading underpinned Peter Kl√∂ckner's enterprises and was at the heart of his industrial empire comprising mills, factories and plants. They later evolved to become Kl√∂ckner-Werke AG and Kl√∂ckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG. The first branch offices were set up way back in 1906, the company's very first year, quickly establishing a network of Kl√∂ckner & Co locations throughout Germany. = The beginnings = Born in 1863 in Koblenz, Peter Kl√∂ckner had already been working in the iron and steel industry for 24 years when the company was founded. He had made a name for himself in the industry through corporate restructuring and investments. With the founding of Kl√∂ckner & Co in 1906, he created a trading company that was strategically in step with the growing iron and steel industry. In addition to the takeovers already completed, Kl√∂ckner pursued a course of expansion from the outset. Wasting no time, he set up further sales offices in Cologne and D√ºsseldorf in the year of the company's founding. = Further expansion = In 1907, Kl√∂ckner opened additional offices in Berlin and Magdeburg, followed in 1909 by Hamburg and Dresden. In 1911, the new Mannheim office covered the southwest and established a connection to the production site in Knutange. Within just a few years, the extensive trade and distribution network had reached a size that made traditional patriarchal management unfeasible. The branch offices were granted the status of independent companies, each working for its own account under their own managing director. The range of products also expanded, as Kl√∂ckner & Co added ore trading and raw materials processing to its previous activities, pig iron trading and steel production. = New business fields = After the plants in Troisdorf and D√ºsseldorf had become firmly anchored within the Kl√∂ckner Group, its companies covered the entire spectrum of industrial production. The trading company served as a connecting link in the production chain, which as early as 1912 extended from ore mines to the manufacture of wire and machinery. In 1913, the company entered the scrap dealing business, which evolved into an especially lucrative branch of iron and steel trading. = World War I = No sooner had the company arrived at the pinnacle of success than it faced a major setback. On August 1, 1914, the German Reich declared war on Russia. The ramifications of the war dealt industry a serious blow. Notably, the draft of a great many workers posed a problem ‚Äì for Peter Kl√∂ckner, too. His plant at Knutange in Lorraine, for example, had to cut back production drastically during the war years because many Italians and Poles who had been working there returned to their home countries when the war broke out. Despite these setbacks, Peter Kl√∂ckner steadfastly continued to pursue his life's work throughout the war. = Growth in times of crisis = Kl√∂ckner & Co held its ground through the post-World War I recession, compensating for losses in the steel business by expanding its fields of activity. Sales increased. The scrap trade boomed while other business such as trading pitwood, coal and chemicals generated additional revenues. In the 1920s and ‚Äô30s, the company opened its first branches in Europe, South America and North America and set up a special foreign operations department. The steel trader whose business focused chiefly on Germany had now grown into a distributor with international operations and a broad product portfolio. Dividing the company into Kl√∂ckner-Werke AG and Kl√∂ckner & Co served to further strengthen the independent nature of the distribution activities. In December 1936, Peter Kl√∂ckner's business success was overshadowed by an unexpected tragedy: Waldemar, Kl√∂ckner's only son and potential successor, was killed in a car accident. His place at the helm of the business was filled by another family member, G√ºnther Henle, the husband of Peter Kl√∂ckner's stepdaughter. = In the throes of political upheaval = Following Peter Kl√∂ckner's death on October 5, 1940, G√ºnther Henle took over as Managing Director of the Group. Due to the company's strategic importance for the German arms industry, the Kl√∂ckner plants fell under Nazi control during the turmoil of the war. After being ousted from his position as Managing Director of the Kl√∂ckner Group by the Nazis in 1942, Henle fled briefly to Berlin but soon returned and took over the management of Kl√∂ckner & Co. Even during the Nazi regime, the trading company remained relatively independent. Normal trading, however, was scarcely possible during the war years (see also War economy). = New beginnings and the Wirtschaftswunder = After the war, the Kl√∂ckner Group fell under the supervision of the Allies. Their aim was to break up the large corporation. Despite these difficult conditions, Kl√∂ckner & Co managed to make a fresh start surprisingly quickly. Like the other Kl√∂ckner enterprises, the trading company benefited from the rapid upswing in international demand for iron and steel. Following the divestiture of Kl√∂ckner-Werke AG and Kl√∂ckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG in the 1950s, Kl√∂ckner evolved into a strongly diversified organization. Steel sales in Germany were very profitable during the Wirtschaftswunder years. Foreign branches bolstered international business. Kl√∂ckner seized the opportunities the booming economy offered in other industries, too, broadening its spectrum from plastics to heating oil and from the maritime industry to burner technology. = International expansion = After the Wirtschaftswunder era, Kl√∂ckner responded to fundamental changes in the steel market by offering more services, reorganizing its warehouses and stepping up international trading operations. The company expanded other trading areas alongside its core business of steel distribution and tapped into new fields of business. Diversification and international expansion proved sound strategies through the economic ups and downs of the 1970s and ‚Äô80s, keeping the Group on a steady path to success over two decades. Then, in the late 1980s, a failed crude-oil futures contract plunged the company into a crisis that threatened its very existence. The losses incurred through this speculation decimated the company‚Äôs capital base, the ‚Äúoil debacle‚Äù costing 600 million Deutschmarks. Peter Henle, who was responsible for the business segment concerned, accepted the consequences and resigned from the Group's management. Deutsche Bank came to the rescue, providing 400 million Deutschmarks to cover the losses and thus staving off bankruptcy. For Kl√∂ckner, fundamental restructuring was now the order of the day. Deutsche Bank took over the company and transformed it into a joint stock company. For the first time in its history stretching back over 80 years, Kl√∂ckner was no longer a family-run business. As part of the rescue package, ownership of the tradition-steeped enterprise was transferred to VIAG. Under the new management, the 1990s saw Kl√∂ckner evolve into a contemporary, international distribution specialist operating in areas such as steel, PC products, chemicals, textiles and tent systems. Kl√∂ckner significantly expanded its international presence in steel during these years. = Focusing on core business = In spring 1997, Kl√∂ckner announced its decision to retrain the focus on its core business, steel and metal distribution. This move was brought to life with a new logo featuring the Kl√∂ckner & Co dog and the slogan ‚Äúmulti metal distribution,‚Äù which are still the face of the company today. As Kl√∂ckner continued to expand its stockholding steel distribution in Europe, it set about divesting those segments that were no longer part of the Group's core business. In 1997, Kl√∂ckner & Co spun off the textiles activities to a non-consolidated unit in preparation for their sale. At the end of the year, the Group transferred its remaining stake in Thyssen Kl√∂ckner Recycling GmbH to the majority shareholder. Early 1998 saw the sale of Kl√∂ckner Chemiehandel GmbH. Computer 2000 AG changed hands in the summer of 1998 and was bought by the US company Tech Data Corporation. Around the same time, Kl√∂ckner also disposed of R√∂der Zeltsysteme und Service AG as planned, and transferred its remaining stake in Kl√∂ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH (INA) to the majority shareholder. After all these changes, Kl√∂ckner had completely restructured within just 15 months. What was once a diversified conglomerate had become a pure steel and metal distributor. Business volume as measured by sales fell by half, from 18.6 billion Deutschmarks in 1997 to 9.5 billion in 1998. The workforce shrank from 14,655 to 10,752. In the fall of 1998, the then parent company, VIAG, announced its intention to part ways with the Duisburg steel distributor. In 2001, Kl√∂ckner & Co was sold to the Balli Group, a UK-based raw materials trader. At the time, Kl√∂ckner's workforce numbered 10,000 and its annual sales came to ‚Ç¨4.8 billion. But the Balli Group's two Iranian owners had financed the approximately ‚Ç¨1.1 billion takeover this way: Hassan Alaghband and Vahid Alaghband admitted to having siphoned off ‚Ç¨47.5 million from the Kl√∂ckner & Co Group's accounts even prior to the takeover for the purposes of financing the transaction. Previously, the sum that moved from Kl√∂ckner & Co accounts to Switzerland was reported to have been ‚Ç¨120 million. The brothers each received suspended sentences of one-and-a-half years and fines of between ‚Ç¨1.75 million and ‚Ç¨2.25 million for embezzlement and abetting embezzlement. During the trial relating to this financing method, the two owners claimed that WestLB, aware of Balli's financing difficulties, refused them a ‚Ç¨150 million loan so the bank itself could take advantage of a lien on the Kl√∂ckner shares at Balli's expense and reap the profits for itself. Two years after the takeover, Balli sold 94.5% of the steel and metal distribution company to WestLB and 5.1% to Hamburgische Landesbank. Along with the change of ownership, there was also a change in the Group's top management: Dr. Thomas Ludwig, who had been a member of Kl√∂ckner & Co's Management Board from 1991 to 1995, was appointed the new CEO. Under his aegis, the company resumed its course of strategic expansion. = Stock market flotation = In 2005, Kl√∂ckner was sold to the US private equity company Lindsay Goldberg & Bessemer (LGB), which finally launched it on the stock market in June 2006 and went on to sell the majority of its stake in October of that year. Currently, all the company's shares are publicly traded (public float) (as of August 2011). The shares are admitted to trading on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with additional post- admission obligations (Prime Standard). Kl√∂ckner & Co shares were admitted to the MDAX index of the German Stock Exchange on January 29, 2007. The shares have been listed on the SDAX index since March 21, 2016. Kl√∂ckner & Co ranks among Germany's 160 largest listed companies. Identified institutional investors now hold 62% of all shares, which makes them the largest group of shareholders. Most of the institutional investors are from Germany and the USA. Another 27% of shares are in the hands of private investors. = Expansive acquisition strategy = Since its 2006 IPO, Kl√∂ckner & Co has pursued an expansive acquisition strategy, with takeovers already totaling 26 companies. Kl√∂ckner & Co now ranks among Germany's 80 largest listed companies. In April 2007, Kl√∂ckner announced its takeover of steel distributor Primary Steel through its US subsidiary Namasco. The new US subsidiary enabled Kl√∂ckner to significantly expand its activities there, with sales soaring by some 60%. In April 2008, Ulrich Becker was appointed to the Management Board. In addition to the Group's operating activities in Europe, Kl√∂ckner Global Sourcing's business fell under Becker's purview along with logistics, process management and international product management. Shortly after his appointment, the company was converted into a European Public Company (SE) in August 2008, and was known from then on as Kl√∂ckner & Co SE. In response to the financial crisis that began mounting in 2007, Kl√∂ckner launched a program of urgent measures it called ‚ÄúWave 1‚Äù in October 2008. It ordered the temporary suspension of acquisitions, cost cutting, debt reduction and shoring up of Group financing. March 2009 saw the initiation of another program of urgent measures, known as ‚ÄúWave 2.‚Äù In a move to return to the acquisition strategy the company had been pursuing since the 2006 IPO, Kl√∂ckner launched a convertible bond issue in June 2009, followed shorty after by a rights issue. In November 2009, Gisbert R√ºhl replaced Thomas Ludwig as CEO of Kl√∂ckner & Co. In addition to that office, R√ºhl also retained his function as CFO of the Group. Ten days after Gisbert R√ºhl took office, Kl√∂ckner signed a preliminary agreement to acquire Becker Stahl-Service Group (BSS). Kl√∂ckner & Co completed the takeover of Bl√§si AG in January 2010, ending the temporary suspension of its acquisition strategy triggered by the global economic crisis; on March 1, 2010, the Kl√∂ckner & Co Management Board announced that the BSS acquisition had been brought to a successful conclusion. Kl√∂ckner acquired Macsteel Service Centers USA in April 2011. In May 2011, the company took over Frefer, Brazil's third largest independent steel and metal distributor. The following month, Kl√∂ckner effected a rights issue. The issue of 33,250,000 new no-par- value shares generated net issue proceeds of some ‚Ç¨516 million, earmarked chiefly for the continued pursuit of the ‚ÄúKl√∂ckner & Co 2020‚Äù growth strategy. At the end of 2011, Kloeckner Metals (Changshu) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Kl√∂ckner & Co, opened. The Group's first-ever steel service center in China is located in Changshu, an urban municipality in the east of the People's Republic near Shanghai and the provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui. Until then, Kloeckner Metals had supplied machinery and mechanical engineering companies located primarily in the greater Changshu area from Europe. Against the backdrop of shrinking demand for steel in Europe coupled with uncertain economic prospects, the Group had launched a comprehensive restructuring program back in the fall of 2011 which entailed selling or closing 70 locations and cutting some 2,200 jobs. Kl√∂ckner completed the restructuring program at the end of 2013, as announced by CEO Gisbert R√ºhl at the financial statements press conference on March 6, 2014. = Digitalization = As part of its long-term growth strategy, Kl√∂ckner & Co has set itself the goal of digitalizing its entire supply chain. Kl√∂ckner & Co set up kloeckner.i, its Group Center of Competence for digitalization, in late 2014. Around 90 employees work there in the areas of product management, software development, data science & AI, business intelligence & analytics, online marketing and user experience & design. In addition, Kl√∂ckner & Co founded XOM Materials, an industry platform open to competitors, in 2018. Specially developed applications such as the Kloeckner Assistant, which automates the processing of customer inquiries using artificial intelligence, are driving up the company's digital transformation. By automating the core processes, Kl√∂ckner & Co is to become a platform company. In addition to setting up its own digital services, Kl√∂ckner & Co is investing in start-ups via the venture company kloeckner.v.

Built about 1853, it is the town's last surviving unaltered district school house. It underwent restoration in the early 2000s, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Mill Cove School is locate near the geographic center of West Bath, on the west side of Berrys Mill Road, one of the community's major north-south routes, about south of its junction with Hill Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a tall pitched gabled roof and clapboard siding. The building is oriented facing south, with the roof gable parallel to the road. Its main facade consists of a pair of sash windows flanking a center entrance, all with simple framed surrounds. The side facing the street has three sash windows, while the west side has a projecting outhouse ell. The interior retains some 19th- century fixtures and trim, including a blackboard. The school was built about 1853, for use in the Mill Cove District, which had been in existence since the 1770s, when the area was still part of Bath. West Bath had as many as four school districts, and this school is the only one to surviving without significant alteration. It remained in service as a municipal school until 1946. From 1946 until 1975 it was used as a clubhouse by the West Bath Men's Club, and was then abandoned. The town sought its demolition beginning in 1998, but local outcry resulted in the formation of a nonprofit dedicated to its care and restoration.

As the title of the novel and Boethius' comments on Fortune as printed on the first page of the very first part suggest, defying the ravages of time and fate forms a central theme to this novel, where the six primary characters seek to challenge fate or to make their own destinies regardless of the social norms or circumstances of the time. Synopsis The book's main events all revolve around a stately Georgian era home named Oxmoon, and are set on the Gower Peninsula in Wales, spanning a period of over forty years in which the owners of Oxmoon all have to face immense challenges, financial hardship and even personal tragedy. The book is divided into six parts, each one based on the point-of-view of several characters, namely: *Robert \\"the Winner\\" Godwin (Part 1) The eldest of five brothers (the others being John, Lionel, Edmund and Thomas) Robert is apparently a successful lawyer based in London and the heir apparent of a family of Welsh rural gentry which while seemingly happy, successful and prosperous, has a skeleton or two in the closet that as usual involves murder and adultery. :His high-handed attitude and dominating personality makes him aloof from his siblings, with two exceptions being... *Ginevra \\"Ginette\\" (Part 2), Robert's cousin and later Robert's wife. Ginevra is haunted by an even darker secret from her past that threatens her relationship with Robert's family and her marriage to Robert; and ... *John Godwin (Part 3), Robert's brother, a sensitive soul trapped in spiritual limbo following the death of his first wife, torn between convention and passion. *Kester (Part 4), Robert and Ginevra's son (and John's nephew), a gifted writer but a terrible financial manager. *Harry (Part 5), John's son and Kester's cousin, who resents Kester's inheritance of Oxmoon and is engaged in a lifelong feud over the same that ends only with Kester's death. *Hal (Part 6), Harry's son, who unlike his father is close to Kester. Hal's story is in fact more of a detective story, in which he investigates the circumstances revolving around Kester Godwin's apparent suicide. =Part 1: Robert (1913)= Upon the death of her husband Conor, Ginevra decides to leave New York City, entrust her young children to her late husband's family from Ireland, and return to Wales to stay with her childhood friend, the lawyer and politician Robert Godwin (who is also heir presumptive to the Godwin family estate, Oxmoon). Robert, who usually prizes logical thinking, willpower and level-headedness, initially expresses annoyance and worry with his feelings for Ginevra (which are mutually reciprocated), but eventually gives in. As Robert and Ginevra revive their childhood relationship and eventually consummate it, he then decides to marry Ginevra but the marriage is vehemently opposed by his mother Margaret, and Robert soon learns why when he discovers several dark secrets in his family revolving around his father Bobby and his grandmother. Bobby killed his mother's lover, Owen Bryn-Davies, to keep him from defrauding the Godwin family of Oxmoon, and has been psychologically damaged ever since. With Margaret's resigned tolerance and understanding, Bobby engaged in many sexual affairs to relieve himself of the guilt of having murdered Owen and one of the women he slept with was a teenaged Ginevra. =Part 2: Ginevra (1913-1919)= Notwithstanding the opposition of his family, Robert goes ahead and marries Ginevra, and despite the abrasive differences inherent in their own individual personalities (Ginevra's describes her mind was all \\"splashes of colour\\" and Robert as \\"emotionally colour-blind\\"1984 hardcover ed, p 149) as well as the opposition of Ginevra's children with Conor, Robert and Ginevra stay together as husband and wife in London (where Robert has his practice as a lawyer), eventually having two sons of their own together, Robin and Kester. The First World War breaks out, and with it, the first of several family tragedies befalls the Godwin family. Robert's brothers Lionel and Edmund are sent to France, where Lionel is killed in action and Edmund is left psychologically maimed, leaving Robert broken and despondent. He takes up mountaineering, and goes off by himself periodically, leaving a bored and slightly paranoid Ginevra alone in their rural setting, with uncomfortable relations with her inlaws, including straitlaced and judgmental John. She travels to London frequently, to see girlfriends and drink away her worries. Robert confides to Ginevra that following a friend's death in a mountaineering accident, he is terrified of the prospect of dying, especially more so now that Lionel is dead. Robert eventually decides to retire to Oxmoon with Ginevra, but even then that is not the end of their tribulations. Robert suddenly contracts an unnamed degenerative neurological disorder (described later in Part 6 as multiple sclerosis) that first manifests itself as unexplained tremors, later intensifying into full-blown paralysis over the next nine years. By the end of Ginevra's story, Robert is wheelchair-bound and realises his condition will only get worse. Feeling she might be happier married to someone else, Robert offers his wife a divorce but Ginevra declines, vowing to stay on by Robert's side till the bitter end, saying \\"I could always walk out on a husband. But I could never turn my back on a friend.\\" =Part 3: John (1921-1928)= Back in Oxmoon, John Godwin, one of Robert's surviving brothers, begins planning to take over as the heir of Oxmoon as Robert's disease begins to take hold, but more deaths soon take place. Bobby's wife, Margaret, suddenly dies following a party, upsetting the balance of the family and unhinging Bobby, who then takes on a mistress, Milly Straker, who turns out to be a gold digger intent on seizing Oxmoon from the Godwins. As Bobby lapses into senility and falls under Straker's control, John, Robert, and their younger brother Thomas vie with her for control of Oxmoon. Due to Bobby's mismanagement a workers' strike breaks out, forcing Straker out of Oxmoon, leaving the mansion and the lands back in the hands of the Godwins. John is also personally affected when his young wife Blanche passes away from a congenital cardiac defect, and his nephew Robin falls to his death through a window. In the immediate aftermath of this, John caves in to his \\"inappropriate\\" feelings for his housekeeper's sister, Bronwen. He resumes his business life in London with his brother Edmund and falls under the spell of a powerful American millionaire, Armstrong. He's given a choice, marry Constance Armstrong, his American employer's daughter and advance his family's commercial and social standing, or follow his heart and spend the rest of his life with the working-class Welshwoman Bronwen, who is, he feels, the only person who knows his true self. John marries Constance but finds his marriage emotionally unsatisfying, so after finding out he has fathered a child with Bronwen, he leaves Constance, choosing love and ostracism over profit and respectability. He struggles socially while making his living through market farming with Thomas' help. The supportive Bronwen convinces John do the right thing: relinquish his personal claim to Oxmoon, and to help aid his nephew Kester to succeed Bobby as master of Oxmoon, now that both Robert and Bobby are dying. =Part 4: Kester (1928-1939)= Home- schooled by Ginevra and living a somewhat sheltered life in a house with a dying father and a sainted deceased older brother, Kester Godwin survives an awkward adolescence to become an author. His recollections reveal that he has inherited his mother's emotional intensity, her propensity for melodrama and sensual excess, as well as Robert's competitive spirit and obsessive nature, leaving Kester with a manipulative streak that becomes more apparent in Harry and Hal's stories. Upon his father's passing, Kester's Uncle John, whose brave romantic decision made him a hero in Ginevra's eyes, makes good his promise to the now deceased Robert and attempts to help Kester prepare for his role as the master of Oxmoon. Once Ginevra dies, Kester comes into his inheritance, but is an incurable romantic who prefers writing over farming, choosing to invest money in indulging his taste for art and sculpture rather than properly running the estate, much to the disgust of his uncle Thomas, and evoking the envy of his cousin Harry, John's son . Harry's jealousy stems from the fact Harry felt that his father should have inherited Oxmoon instead of Ginevra and Kester. Kester's relationship with Thomas becomes more heated and violent when he marries Anna, a German Jew on the run from Hitler's Nazi regime. With the Oxmoon estate in arrears thanks to Kester's mismanagement, John and Thomas are forced to seize control of Oxmoon's management from Kester and Anna. Naturally, Kester vows vengeance to retake back Oxmoon, and on Thomas for having publicly humiliated him and insulted his wife. =Part 5: Harry (1939-1952)= Harry is seen as the perfect boy - handsome, clever and tough - but we learn he is a lost soul, wanting to follow music and desperate for his father's approval. After Bronwen leaves her beloved John to go to Canada to escape their socially-derided relationship, John resumes his London life with Constance and Harry silently melts down at boarding school. John's absence from Wales gives young master of the castle Kester more room to live an idyllic life at Oxmoon, which infuriates Harry. He finds some solace in a local, distant relative, with whom he has nothing in common but sexual attraction. They later marry and have four mostly accidental children who cause Harry more trouble than joy. Desperately unhappy, he volunteers for military service to get away from his pain. A moment of pure joy awaits Harry upon his return -- since his stepmother Constance died two years ago his father rekindled his relationship with Bronwen, the woman Harry considers his mother and his guide towards the good. He arrives at the estate to find her there waiting, and after a tearful reunion, he sees John and Bronwen finally marry. The conflict between the two cousins still remains however, and grows with the eerily coinciding deaths of the young wives of both men. Harry's hatred of Kester only increases when it's revealed that he is estranged from his own young sons (who blame him for their mother's death from complications in childbirth) even as Kester ingratiates himself with one of them, Hal. Yet when Kester kills Thomas (in apparent self-defence), Harry chooses to help cover up the killing and make it look like he died in a car crash, but the struggle is far from over. Kester fears Harry exposing his killing of Thomas, while Harry in turn is afraid Kester will deprive him of Oxmoon and frame him for his uncle's death. Harry's story ends with a cliffhanger, following Kester's invitation to Harry to discuss and resolve their differences in an isolated area near a dangerous stretch of cliffs by the seashore. =Part 6: Hal (1966)= By 1966, Oxmoon is barely a shadow of its prewar self and in a state of disrepair due to the lack of funds available for renovation. In Hal Godwin's account, it is revealed that his uncle Kester was found drowned fourteen years before, and so Hal's story is reminiscent of a crime fiction tale as he seeks to prove that his uncle's death was neither due to suicide nor accident. Hal eventually discovers that his father murdered Kester, but along with this terrible revelation, Hal finds an unlikely means of saving Oxmoon thanks to Kester's literary genius. The novel ends with Oxmoon being restored and reopened as a tourist attraction under the auspices of the National Trust. Shortly after the inauguration ceremony, the Godwin family enjoys one last dance in Oxmoon's now restored ballroom before closing for the night. Author's note Howatch acknowledges that this novel is in fact a re- creation in a modern form of the story of the Plantagenet family of Edward III of England,ibid, p 1,090 the modern characters being created from those of his eldest son Edward of Woodstock (The Black Prince) and his wife Joan of Kent, John of Gaunt and his mistress, later wife, Katherine Swynford, Richard II (son of Edward of Woodstock), Henry IV (son of John of Gaunt) and Henry IV's eldest son King Henry V.

It was selected to be screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 21, 2017.  Plot  The film opens with Milo drinking the blood of a dead man who has his pants down in the men's bathroom. He then steals his wallet, washes his mouth and leaves for home where he crosses a date off his calendar, and adds the stolen cash to a secret bag. He is often shown watching videos of extreme graphic violence, and writing in what appears to be a visual journal. The next morning he throws up the blood. On the way home he is confronted by bullies who hold him down and urinate on him. Taking a shower, we briefly see his back looking like it has suffered burning. At home, where he lives with his brother Lewis, he stares at a closed door before snapping out of it. In the neighborhood he is mocked by thugs. He then meets Sophie, who is apparently new to the neighborhood. He helps her with her bags. The next day, while walking on the beach, he witnesses a group of men drinking beer and taking turns raping Sophie. After they leave he walks in on Sophie as she is cutting herself. They end up talking and drinking. When he leans in towards her bloody arm, she stops him. They come back to his house to watch a video of lambs getting slaughtered violently, during which she abruptly leaves. The next day she explains she had seen similar videos and she simply had to leave. Home alone, Milo is shown staring at the closed door again. He is often shown watching movies about vampires, or just listening to them without watching. He visits the park where he sleeps beneath a bridge and ambushes a hobo and drinks his blood. He then mark another date off his calendar. The next day he ask Sophie out for movies where they watch Nosferatu, which he considers a realistic depiction of vampirism. After, Sophie claims Twilight is a better film and suggests he watch or read it. Milo speaks about what he thinks realistic vampires are like. He points out that he believes vampires cannot kill themselves. They talk about their family, revealing both parents of both of them are dead, specifically that Sophie's grandfather beats her. and Milo's mother having killed herself when he was younger, and that he still doesn't know where her grave is because his brother will not discuss it. On the way home they are harassed by the neighborhood thugs again. Later, she kisses him going home. The next morning they visit the grave of Milo's mother, which Sophie tracked down. The next day, a couple in their car stop and ask Milo if he can help them acquire \\"C\\" or \\"molly\\". He lures the guy to the basement of a nearby building where he hides as the thugs shoot him. After talking to the police, he is escorted back home. Having seen this, the thugs distrust him. Sophie, upset that he's been avoiding her, brings Milo the Twilight book and kisses him. At home, Milo remembers standing next to his mother's fresh corpse with her wrist cut, and tasting her blood. His brother tells him to leave and advises him to be careful regarding both the thugs and the police. Sitting at the docks, Sophie and Milo discuss God, and what they would do with a million dollars. She tells him she would move in with her cousin in Alabama. They sleep together. Looking at his calendar, Milo realizes the date for him to quench his bloodthirst has passed without him noticing. Sophie asks to stay with Milo when she escapes her abusive grandfather. After living happily together for a few days, she discovers his instructions to \\"hunt\\" and kill, and violent drawing and leaves. Milo leaves her a voicemail asking for a chance to explain. Roaming around the town, he finds a drunk, abusive man and follows him home. He enters his house to kill him but also kills his little daughter first and drinks her blood. On the way home he shakes and cries. He contemplates suicide on top of a tall building, but does not go through with it. The next day Sophie apologizes for disappearing. Milo gives Andre, the leader of the thugs, a bag of stolen goods, to they can \\"trust each other again\\". Milo then visits a police station and turns them in. He buys Sophie flowers and they leave for a day of fun. At night, sitting beneath the docks at the beach, he imagines killing her and sucking the blood out of her neck. Upon departure, he gives her the money she needs to move. She asks him to move with her but he refuses and leaves. At home, he watches a shootout during which all of the thugs are arrested. The next morning he leaves Sophie a voicemail asking whether she had left, after which he is gunned down. Sophie calls him back to no avail. He is bagged and moved to a hospital where they remove his heart during autopsy. After he's buried, it is revealed that he wanted the thugs to kill him because he wanted to die and even though he could not kill himself, he could arrange it.

Built about 1899, it is a fine and imposing local example of Colonial Revival architecture, designed to meet the latest school standards of the time. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Wells Village School is located on the west side of the main village of Wells, on the north side of Main Street (Vermont Route 30). It is a long rectangular two-story wood frame building, with hip- roofed end sections at either end of a central gabled section. The front- facing hipped section is fronted by a two-story gabled vestibule, with the main entrance set in a round-arch opening at its base. The front hip section is topped by a square turret with a pyramidal roof and an open belfry. The school was built by the town in about 1899, in order to improve the town's school facilities and merge two district schools. It originally had two classrooms on the ground floor, and an open meeting space with stage on the upper floor, which could be used for town meetings. The building has undergone several alterations over the years, due to changing state requirements for schools. Additional windows and fire exits were added in the early decades of the 20th century. In 1987 the rear addition was added to the building, and the upstairs space was converted into two classrooms.

Antonio Castellanos Mata (7 March 1947 ‚Äì 27 January 2016)Acto de homenaje al Prof. D. Antonio Castellanos Mata was a Spanish physicist.  Personal life  Antonio Castellanos Mata was born on 7 March 1947, in Anto√±anes del P√°ramo near Le√≥n, Spain. A few years later, the family moved to Le√≥n. He was the third and youngest child of Manuel Castellanos Berj√≥n (1910‚Äì1993), a school teacher,http://bibliotecadigital.jcyl.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=10081470 and Fidela Mata Sarmiento (1915‚Äì2013). As a child, Mata was very religious and decided to become a priest. While studying in a seminary, he began studying mathematics and physics on his own. Several months before graduating, Mata was expelled from the seminary. Mata then entered the University of Valladolid. He was awarded the first PhD in physics at the University. He was granted a Fulbright scholarship and spent a year at the Ohio State University. He established long-lasting scientific collaborations in many countries. One of his close friends was Pierre Atten, who inspired Mata with a love for electrohydrodynamics. Mata's first wife was Mar√≠a Elena Navarrete Sandoval. They married in 1975 and had a son, Antonio Castellanos Navarrete, and a daughter, Dayeli Anah√≠ Castellanos Navarrete. In 2006, he married Elena Grekova, with whom he had two sons, Le√≥n Antonievich Castellanos Grekov and Iv√°n Antonievich Castellanos Grekov. In 2014, Mata was diagnosed with kidney cancer. He died on 27 January 2016. Through the end of his life, Mata taught classes, continued research, and directed scientific projects.  Scientific career  Antonio Castellanos defended his PhD thesis, Dispersion theory and its application to the reaction 11B(d, Œ±)Be9, at the University of Valladolid in 1972. He worked at many universities: University of Valladolid, University of the Basque Country, Autonomous University of Madrid; since 1983, he was a full professor at the University of Seville. He made long-term scientific visits to the USA, France, Nicaragua, and Russia, collaborated with researchers from the UK, the Netherlands, China. He worked in various fields of science: #Electrohydrodynamics, #Gas discharges at atmospheric pressure, #Cohesive granular materials. Mata founded a research group at the University of Seville: Electrohydrodynamics and Cohesive Granular Media. This group includes as today more than 20 researchers. He lectured physics at various universities throughout his career. For his last 33 years, he taught electrodynamics and electromagnetism at the Faculty of Physics of the University of Seville. He directed research projects for more than 30 years, and this made it possible for him to organize two laboratories at the University. While dedicating significant effort to pure science, he was also interested in contemporary problems and collaborated with industry (Xerox Corporation, Novartis, Dow Corning, IFPRI). He authored more than 350 papers, collectively having more than 7800 citations.https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BpnTUYwAAAAJ&hl;=en&oi;=ao Noteworthy results include: #Galilean limits of electromagnetism. #Temperature equation and entropy production in electrohydrodynamics. #Self-similar solution for two-dimensional and axisymmetric plumes. #Seminal works on numerical simulation of electrohydrodynamic flows. #Physical mechanism of electrothermohydrodynamic instabilities. #Energy cascade in electrohydrodynamic turbulence. #Stabilization of dielectric liquid bridges by AC electric fields. #Theory of AC electroosmosis and electrothermal flows in microsystems. #Absence of inertial regimes in fine powders. #Model of elastoplastic contact between two powder particles. #Microstructure characterization of fluidized bed of fine particles: aggregation, solidlike- fluidlike transition, fluctuations, influence of electromagnetic fields.

Career  Built as Mar√©chal de Broglie for private owners and transferred to the French East India Company, the ship sailed two journeys to China as a merchantman. In April 1779, she was purchased by the Crown to ferry furnitures to Isle de France (now Mauritius) and be commissioned as a warship upon her arrival. In June, she was coppered, and she received her name of Ajax on 13 August. On 16 February 1780, under Captain Bouvet de Pr√©court, Ajax departed Lorient with Prot√©e, √âl√©phant and Charmante, escorting a convoy bound for India. In late February, off Spain, the convoy met Rodney's fleet; Prot√©e sacrificed herself to hold the British back and was captured on 24, while Charmante returned to Lorient, arriving on 3 March, and the convoy escaped under the protection of Ajax. Arrived at Isle the France, Ajax joined Suffren's squadron. At the Battle of Sadras, on 17 February 1782, Suffren ordered Ajax and Flamand, under Cuverville, to attack the British line to leeward. They both maneuvered to this effect, but then Tromelin, on Annibal, countermanded the order by signaling Ajax and Flamand to return to their post in the line of battle. While Ajax obeyed the order, Flamand sailed on and Saint-F√©lix, of Brillant, requested permission to replace Ajax. After the battle, Suffren apologised to Bouvet for the confusion in his orders that had frustrated him from a prime role in the battle, promising to make up for it at the next occasion. She took part in the Battle of Negapatam on 6 July 1782, still under Captain Bouvet. The rigging of Ajax having been damaged by a gale the night before and not been repaired, Bouvet requested authorisation to retreat to effect his repairs; when Suffren refused, Ajax remained with her squadron but without taking part in the action. Suffren was furious. In July 1782, in the wake of the Battle of Negapatam, Suffren appointed Lieutenant de Beaumont le Ma√Ætre to replace Bouvet. In the night of 12 January 1783, chasing the frigate Fine which she had mistaken for a privateer, HMS Coventry (1757) sailed into Ganjam Roads, where Suffren's H√©ros, Illustre, Ajax and Brillant were at anchor. Captain Wolseley, of Coventry, had no information that French vessels were in the area and so allowed the current to take him towards the vessels, the wind being weak. As Coventry arrived, Suffren, on H√©ros, was sending a boat over to Illustre, but the boat master was drunk and instead mistakenly came aboard Coventry. The boat's crew was promptly taken prisoners and taken to the orlop deck. At this moment, the French division noticed Coventry, and Illustre, Ajax and Brillant opened fire. Interrogating his prisoners, Wolseley learnt that the ships firing on him were part of Suffren's squadron, at which point his men rushed below. Alone on his quarterdeck, Wolseley had no choice but to surrender. Ajax then took part in the Battle of Trincomalee under Beaumont le Ma√Ætre, and in the Battle of Cuddalore under Captain Dupas de la Manceli√®re, who was killed in the action.

She was elected in the non-partisan election on May 10, 2016. She began a 12-year term in January 2017. Walker was named in articles of impeachment passed by the West Virginia House of Delegates on August 13, 2018, was \\"reprimanded and censured\\" on October 2, 2018, but allowed to remain in office after being tried in the West Virginia Senate.Senators reprimand Justice Walker, but vote to not impeach. Walker is the 77th justice to serve on the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. She was an unsuccessful candidate for the same office in 2008.  Career  = Campaign = She stated that she was running for the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia because West Virginians deserve a fair and impartial court system. She stated that she understands the importance of the role of the Supreme Court as an independent branch of government. She was generally considered the right-most of the four serious candidates in the election. Those she defeated to earn the spot included then-current Justice Brent Benjamin (the incumbent) and former Justice and state Attorney General Darrell McGraw. = State Supreme Court female majority = Once Walker took office, West Virginia had a female majority on the state Supreme Court for the first time in history. West Virginia is one of 11 states whose top courts have a majority of women. = Impeachment = Following a series of controversies involving excessive spending, the West Virginia House Judiciary Committee voted on August 7, 2018 to recommend that Walker and the other three remaining justices be impeached \\"for maladministration, corruption, incompetency, neglect of duty, and certain high crimes and misdemeanors\\". On August 13, 2018 the full House of Delegates approved the Judiciary Committee recommendation and impeached Walker. On October 2, 2018, after a two-day impeachment trial, the West Virginia Senate, in a 32-1-1 vote, decided not to remove Walker from office. The Senate later voted to publicly \\"reprimand and censure\\" Walker for her actions in the spending scandal.Senators acquit Justice Walker on impeachment charge = Earlier career = Prior to taking the bench, Walker was an attorney for West Virginia University Medicine. Prior to that, Walker was a partner in the law firm of Bowles Rice, where she concentrated her statewide practice on labor and employment law for more than 20 years. She has advised large and small employers in a wide variety of industries including manufacturing, energy, health care, financial services, professional services and associations and retail sales. She also has experience representing higher education entities, municipalities, counties and boards of education in the public sector. In 2012, Walker was elected a Fellow of the College of Labor and Employment Lawyers, which is an international membership association of more than one thousand of the best and brightest lawyers who practice in labor employment law.

It preserves a sample of Cerrado vegetation. History The Area of relevant ecological interest (ARIE) was at one time part of the property of the Vassununga Sugar Mill, which went bankrupt in the late 1960s. Four plots covered in seasonal forest and one, P√©-de-Gigante, covered in Cerrado vegetation became the property of the state. On 26 October 1970 these five plots became the Vassununga State Park, the responsibility of the S√£o Paulo State Forestry Institute. On 3 December 1971 another portion of land covered in seasonal forest was added to the Vassununga State Park, while the P√©-de-Gigante was assigned to the University of S√£o Paulo (USP) Institute of Biosciences, and became the Manga√≠ba Biological Station. There followed more than two decades of legal disputes between the USP and the Forestry Institute. The Cerrado P√© de Gigante Area of Relevant Ecological Interest was created by decree 99.275 on 6 June 1990, and is administered at the federal level by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). In 1995 it was agreed that the ARIE would be jointly managed by the USP Biosciences Institute and the Forestry Institute. Under an agreement of 3 July 1997 the ARIE became a part of Vassununga State Park. It is classed as IUCN protected area category IV (habitat/species management area), with the objective of maintaining natural ecosystems of regional or local importance and regulating permissible use of these areas to make it compatible with the objectives of conserving nature. Location Cerrado P√©-de-Gigante covers an area of . It is in the municipality of Santa Rita do Passa Quatro in the state of S√£o Paulo. It is not far from the Buriti de Vassununga Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, which was also created on 6 June 1990. The terrain is gently rolling. The area has altitudes ranging from above sea level. The climate is \\"Central Brazil Tropical\\" or \\"Subtropical Savannah.\\" Average annual temperature is below , higher in the summer. Annual rainfall averages over , with a dry season from May to September. Environment The surrounding region is mainly covered in cerrado, with areas of semi-deciduous forest. From the end of the 19th century human activity has made major changes, removing timber and introducing coffee plantations. The original vegetation survives only in islands, mostly less than . The protected area holds various types of cerrado vegetation including savannah, semi-deciduous and riparian forest, mostly in relatively good condition. The ARIE is home to mid-sized animals such as capybaras, deer and peccaries, as well as several rare or endangered species including the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), cougar (Felis concolor), Tayra (Eira barbara) and giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla).

From the mid-1860s, she became one of Stockholm's most highly regarded portrait photographers. Biography Born on 16 October 1833 in Kalmar in the south of Sweden, Sj√∂man was the daughter of John Peter Hammarqvist, a captain in the merchant navy. When 22, she married Captain Sven Sj√∂man, 15 years her senior. After moving to Stockholm in 1857, the couple had two sons and a daughter. When her husband died of alcoholism in 1864, she worked as the assistant of the photographer Carl Johan Malmberg who had established one of the city's earliest photographic studios in 1859. She later took over his studio and operated it in her own name. Rosalie Sj√∂man: Alma, c.1880 Sj√∂man soon gained a reputation as one of Stockholm's best portrait photographers. She eventually employed a staff of some ten assistants, opening studios in Kalmar, Halmstad and Vaxholm. She was also conversant with the latest techniques, coating her images with a thin film of collodion to gain a glossy effect. She also produced coloured portraits with tinting, several of which can be seen in Stockholm's Nordic Museum. Artur Hazelius bought 26 of her works for his collection in 1877, four years after he founded the museum. Examples of her portraits can also be seen in the Royal Library. In 1875, she married the photographer Gustaf Fredrik Diehl who had been active in Vyborg, Finland. After giving birth to a third son and a second daughter, in 1881 she moved with her five children to a new property of Regeringsgatan where she opened a new studio, soon separating from Diehl. In the early 1880s, she took her most celebrated portrait, a photograph of her daughter Alma surrounded by roses. She continued to run her studio on Regeringsgatan until 1905. Sj√∂man died in Stockholm in 1919, aged 86. She is remembered as one of Sweden's earliest female professional photographers along with Emma Schenson in Uppsala, Hilda Sj√∂lin in Malm√∂ and Wilhelmina Lagerholm in √ñrebro See also *List of Swedish women photographers References  Further reading  * Category:1833 births Category:1919 deaths Category:19th- century Swedish photographers Category:Swedish women photographers Category:People from Kalmar Category:19th-century women photographers ","title":"Rosalie Sj√∂man"},{"id":"50510909","text":"Lars \\"Erik\\" Westberg (born 1 September 1956 in Stockholm) is a Swedish conductor and professor in music performance.

It is one of the former ceramic workshops of Choisy-le-Roi, in the 10th district of Paris, France. Former headquarter of a ceramic factory now turned \\"The Manor of Paris\\"  Description  When it opened, this tourist attraction featured 13 Parisian legends from the 18th to the 20th centuries. Since then, 4 legends have been added, and more are expected to be added. With an area of 1000 m¬≤ (10763,9 ft¬≤), it is divided into two floors of 500 m¬≤ (5381,96 ft¬≤). These 23 rooms are what makes the journey interactive for visitors.leparisien.fr Un manoir hant√© fera revivre treize l√©gendes parisiennes d√®s vendredi √† Paris - 05/05/2011 The Manoir de Paris aims to extend itself by an additional 1000 m¬≤, as well. Next to the three animatronic figures imported from the United States,leparisien.fr Une maison hant√©e en plein Paris - 07/05/2011 including a gargoyle which adorns the entrance and a rabid dog, there are roughly 20 trained actors in costume who introduce visitors to specific Parisian legends.Visiter : Le Manoir de Paris The haunted mansion also offers five levels of \\"fearfulness\\".  History  The site is situated at the edge of the former Saint-Lazare precinct, a leper colony adjacent to what was the Prison Saint-Lazare. Two Cour des miracles were situated near the Porte Saint-Denis, not far from where the Manor now stands. In 1889, the Choisy-le-Roi ceramics workshops, which was part of the firm Hyppolyte Boulenger, built their new store and head office at 18, Rue du Paradis. The building was partially registered as monument historique (historical monument) in 1981; it became the \\"Mus√©e de l'Affiche\\" in 1978, and the Mus√©e de la Publicit√© in 1982, before moving out in 1990. The Manoir de Paris project took 2 years to plan and 6 months to build and rehearse for. Adil Houti, a young American living in Paris, was the instigator for this project. Born in 1983, Houti took part in the creation of two haunted houses in Texas: the first one, \\"13th Floor St Antonio\\", is an attraction based on San Antonio, Texas superstitions, while the second, named \\"House of Torment\\", is about the Apocalypse in Austin, Texas.  Legends  The Parisian legends told during the visit are inspired by real facts, coming from literature or Parisian folklore: the Catacombs of Paris, the crocodile in the Paris sewers, the Phantom of the Opera, the prisoner in the iron mask, the vampires of Paris, the Paris M√©tro, the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, the phantom of the Tuileries, the Alchemist's Library, the Bloody Baker, the assassins' cabaret, gargoyle and chimera, the hunchback of Notre Dame de Paris. To these were added, some time after the opening: the desecrated grave of Sergeant Bertrand, the witch \\"La Voisin\\", the \\"Barber's Blade\\" and the guillotine. Starting from October 18, 2013, a new attraction has been on offer, named \\"Asylum\\": in 2013, the Manoir de Paris staged a special Halloween event, between October 18th and November 10th. During that period, the usual tour was replaced by one where new monsters and costumed characters greeted the visitors.

M. Coakley. Based on a true story, it stars Sean Faris, Mehcad Brooks, and Danielle Savre. Plot Samuel returns home from his work at Supa Value Glass & Screens Hardware Store, where he works with Lola, with a branch of flowers, only to find his wife Ashley cheating on him with Damien on their own marriage anniversary, holding them captive at gunpoint on a hot New Orleans day, while he decides their fates. At first, Samuel shoots both of them, but then finds himself re-experiencing the events in his mind. Instead of shooting them, he forces Ashley and Damien to disclose about their personal lives and their sexual encounters. Samuel learns that Damien has a wife, Jasmine, who is three months pregnant, and that Ashley's abusive ex-boyfriend was actually her ex-husband (it is not clear if Ashley is a bigamist). Samuel has Damien call Jasmine, using the speaker phone so all can hear the conversation that is about to take place, and tell her what he has just done with Ashley. Jasmine reveals that Damien has cheated on her numerous times in the past. Devastated, Jasmine is asked by Samuel to decide Damien's fate, whether to return home to her, or let Samuel shoot him. He alludes to some suggestive decision from her to come there and confront Damien in person, and have sexual intercourse with Samuel to show how she felt about being cheated upon. Samuel justifies his decision to kill Damien using his twisted religious beliefs that vengeance is his and not the Lord's. Samuel later finds himself back in reality, just after burying Ashley and Damien beneath the rose bed in the back yard.

It is filled with jam and covered with lattice patterns of pastry. Handmade by pastry chefs in the Hautes-Alpes and the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence or industrially made by some manufacturers. It has the advantage of being able to be kept for months without losing its flavour.  Origin and history  The \\"Tarte des Alpes\\" is a speciality of the Valgaudemar Valley, where it is called \\"pie of the valley\\" or \\"country pie\\". An almost identical version can be found in the Champsaur or in the Queyras regions, where it is called \\"Queyras pie\\".http://ete.queyras-montagne.com/la-tarte-queyrassine-abries.html It was originally made in winter, using fruit jams from the summer. A creamy plum filling was used for the pie, with raspberry or blueberry jam added. Today this pie, with its decoration of strips of pastry, is one of the emblems of the regional gastronomy of the Southern Alps.  Ingredients  Tarte des Alpes is made from a sweet shortcrust pastry and jam. Over time, the jams or jellies filling the pie have diversified and there are now many fruit flavours. The main ones are blueberry, raspberry, apricot, prune, strawberry, fig, lemoncurd, cherry, and forest fruits.http://gap.cylex- france.fr/entreprises_12520860/l'alpine-et-ses-d%C3%A9lices.html  Preparation  The pastry is made from flour, butter, caster sugar, eggs, salt and yeast. The choice of jam or jelly is a matter of taste; usually, a little pectin is added. Once the pastry has been rolled out, it is placed in a pie dish and filled with jam or fruit jelly. The strips of pastry for the covering are generally 3mm thick, 5mm wide and form a criss-cross pattern.  Consumption and conservation  These pies can be eaten hot or cold; after meals; at breakfast; with coffee or afternoon tea. They can be kept for two or three months, all the while retaining their original flavour.
