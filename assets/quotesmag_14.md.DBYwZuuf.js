He was a right-arm off break bowler who appeared six times for Australia, and was touted as a promising prospect to replace Shane Warne. However, a number of unproductive seasons meant that he lost his national contract in 2008, and was dropped by South Australia in 2010, ending his first-class career. He first appeared for South Australia in 2004, and after two strong seasons for South Australia, he was selected to tour Bangladesh with the national team in April 2006. He made his Test debut when other players were rested, and subsequently played the three ODIs on the tour. The following season, after a string of poor performances, he was replaced in South Australia's first-class team, and although he performed better in 2007–08, his bowling figures continued to wane, and he was eventually dropped from the state side, resulting in the loss of his South Australian contract at the end of the 2009–10 season. Cricket career Cullen made his first-class cricket debut in 2004 for South Australia, appearing against Victoria. He claimed four wickets in the match, which South Australia won. His debut season drew the plaudits of Shane Warne, who claimed that Cullen would be \\"a certainty to play for Australia.\\" He took 43 wickets at an average of 30.37 that year, and the following season he was named as the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year, despite breaking his finger. After the conclusion of the Australian domestic season, Cullen was selected as part of the Australian squad to face Bangladesh. He did not play in the first Test match, but was called up for the second, as several members of the team were rested due to fatigue. He took one wicket in the match, in which Australia's other two spinners, Warne and Stuart MacGill, took 15 wickets between them. He played in all three of the One Day Internationals (ODIs) on the tour, taking two wickets at an average of 49. Along with Cameron White, he played for Somerset as their overseas player for the 2006 English cricket season. He had a relatively unproductive spell with the county, taking seven wickets in four matches at an average over 50. He left Somerset early to play in the Top End series for Australia A. He subsequently played in two ODIs during the 2006–07 DLF Cup, but remained wicket-less in both. Despite his early promise, and the positive comments made by Warne and Ricky Ponting, these were Cullen's final appearances for Australia, ending his international career with one Test wicket and two ODI wickets in six matches. He struggled in 2006–07, and after only taking 13 wickets in the Pura Cup, he was replaced in South Australia's first-class team by Cullen Bailey. He travelled to Pakistan with Australia A in September of that year, and in three List A matches against Pakistan A, he claimed three wickets: the best by any Australian, as they lost all three games. In the first unofficial Test between the sides, Cullen took five wickets in the match to help Australia A to an innings victory. Cullen once again had poor bowling figures during the 2007–08 domestic season in Australia, but he blamed the pitches, claiming that \\"I compare myself against the spinners in every game and I've pretty much out-bowled the majority.\\" Cricket Australia disagreed, and he lost his national contract at the end of the season. In the 2008–09 season, Cullen took ten first-class wickets at an average of 77.70, The following 2009–10 season, his only appearance came in the Ford Ranger Cup, in which he played against Queensland, bowling six overs without taking a wicket. That was his final appearance for South Australia, ending his career with 130 first-class wickets at an average of 44.28, and 56 List A wickets at 35.39. He lost his contract with South Australia at the end of that season.

History RIC records from 1890 show that Ballymore Irish Brigade had 34 members with officers listed as Revd J McCarthy, John Byrne, Laurence Morrissey and Pat Keenan. The club affiliated 1887–1926. James Doyle and Anthony Corrigan attended the 1889 convention. Kilmoney near Baltinglass was also recorded as affiliated to Kildare GAA in a Leinster Leader of 1890. Ballymore participated in the first Kildare junior championship in 1906. In 1916 it left the GAA altogether over a dispute with the County Board over the right to appeal a decision, resulting from a dispute over the Junior Football final with Kilcullen. After that, Ballymore was a soccer town. One of its most famous sons was Jack Byrne of Bohemians and Shamrock Rovers. Gaelic Football Ballymore reformed in 1928 and won the county minor championship in 1943. That team came from Junior B in 1949 to win the Junior Championship in 1951, Intermediate Championship in 1952 and the Senior Championship in 1953. Larry Stanley trained the team that won the senior championship in 1953, his nephew Jim Clarke scored the winning goal. Clarke, Kevin Burke and Myles Doyle went on to star on Kildare football teams. Ten of the team had been on the side that won the Junior B championship five years earlier. No other club has won the junior, intermediate and senior championships in successive seasons in Kildare. They reached the 1956 county final and lost 1–6 to 0–4 against a Military College team that did not have a single Kildareman, and suffered the abuse of the press and the County Board after a rough match in which one Ballymore player was sent off, two players were expelled from the Association, and another was suspended for two months. Other achievements include a spectacular 6–3 to 0–3 victory over Kilcock in the Intermediate League final of 1951 which place in February 1953, when both were senior teams. There was an echo of the past when Ballymore won junior and intermediate championships in successive years 1985–1986. In 1985 Ballymore overcame the challenge of a strong Ballyteague side, while in 1986 they defeated hot favourites Suncroft in the final. They also defeated Castledermot in 1994 to regain the Intermediate Championship crown and Senior status. Ballymore have since been regraded and contest the Intermediate Championship. On 16 October 2010 Ballymore once more won the Intermediate Championship defeating Confey in a closely contested final. On 16 January 2011 Ballymore won the 2010 Leinster Intermediate Football Championship defeating Nobber (Meath) by 0–12 to 0–10 in the delayed final played on their home pitch Handball Ballymore Eustace court was constructed during the First World War. A roof and gallery was added in the 1920s, in 1953 the walls were raised and lighting was installed in 1962. The club was affiliated to the Irish Amateur Handball Union until it ceased in 1935. Tommy Leahy was the leading IAHU player of the 1920s while Jack Byrne, Jack Byrne, Mick Dowling and Jim Dolan also won titles. When Ballymore affiliated to the GAA handball body in 1940, Mick Dowling came out of retirement to win junior and senior hardball titles within three years. Although softballs had been introduced in 1915 the leather hardball game was the prestige event of handball until the 1950s, winning five hardball titles. In 1979 Tom O'Rourke brought the first softball title to Ballymore when he beat Packie Ryan of Dublin. All of Kildare's top handballers of that era, Tom O'Rourke, Cecil and Pius Winders, Matt Purcell, Greg Lawlor and Michael Dowling (son of the old IAHU and IAHA champions) came from Ballymore. Camogie A Ballymore team applied to the Kildare GAA board for recognition in 1921. Camogie was revived in the 1950s when the registered colours were maroon and again in 1980, when the registered colours were green and white.

The school works under the auspice of the local Roman Catholic Benedictine Monasterio de Tibatí, and the Assumption Abbey in Richardton, North Dakota, United States. It enrolls 1,400 students in grades transition through 11th grade which is equivalent to 1st through 12th grades or a combined primary and secondary education in the United States. San Carlos has welcomed students from all creeds and religions: it is not mandatory to be a Catholic to be a San Carlos student. The school has also welcomed people from all walks of life and nationalities, since its inception. However, an IQ test and other intelligence and dexterity examinations are required for students' enrollment in the school. San Carlos is named after Saint Charles Borromeo and its motto, Ora et Labora (Pray and Work), is based on the teachings of Saint Benedict.  History  In April 1960, Abbot Ignatius Hunkler received an invitation from Colombian Archbishop Luis Concha Córdoba to establish a boys school in Bogotá. The Abbot in turn invited him to Assumption Abbey in Richardton, North Dakota, in order to present this proposal to the monastic community. He went there, and the monks agreed to accept the task. As a result, monks Lawrence Wagner O.S.B., Frederic Mundt O.S.B., Anselm Ruelle O.S.B. and Adrian Mundt O.S.B., were sent to Puerto Rico in June to learn Spanish. They arrived in Bogotá on August 6, 1960, the same day the city was celebrating its foundation -(it was founded in 1538). They immediately began preparations to run the school. Colegio San Carlos officially opened its doors on February 4, 1961. Since its inception in the 1960s, the school has been educating future scientists, politicians, doctors, lawyers, engineers, artists, architects and many others to be leaders in their professions and their communities.

Francis Wehri the \\"Cruz de Boyacá\\", Colombia's highest distinction. The school's most important principals have been Fr. Sebastian Schmidt O.S.B. (1934-2017) who was rector only for a few years, but remained a strong presence throughout the history of the school as a teacher, staff member and sports coach, and Fr. Francis Wehri O.S.B. who by mid-1966 replaced Schmidt. Wehri, also born in 1934, was in charge of leading the school for 49 continuous years. A dedicated musician (proficient in piano and organ), he arrived in Colombia with little knowledge of Spanish, and took the office of rector at 36 years of age. He soon managed to become a permanent reference for excellence in educational standards and academic guidance on a national level. After many years in this tenure he was awarded Colombian honorary citizenship by president Juan Manuel Santos, and in 2011 also received the country's highest distinction: The Cruz de Boyacá. After a short period of illness, Wehri resigned his post as rector, but decided to stay in Colombia and continue residing at the School's monastery. He died in Bogotá on July 30, 2017, and was replaced two years before his death by secular and current rector Juan Fernando Corral Strassman, a 1970s alumnus.  Academic performance  Colegio San Carlos is highly recognized in Colombia for consistently directly placing some 15% of its graduates in universities throughout the world. Some of the prestigious schools that San Carlistas have attended directly after graduation include: MIT, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Cornell University, UCLA, Georgetown University, Lehigh University, Harvard University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago, Columbia University, Brown University, RISD, University of Michigan, Cambridge University, Oxford University, Architectural Association School of Architecture and the London School of Economics. Many San Carlos graduates who study in Colombian universities later apply for postgraduate studies abroad. Even though the school has not adopted any international teaching system such as the AP or IB, its high-profile compulsory curriculum ensures a high-quality, fully bilingual, homogeneous education for its pupils. All graduating students must take the ICFES national standardized exam. Students wishing to study abroad are encouraged to sit for standardized tests such as the SAT or the ACT. In 2011 the school celebrated its 50th anniversary. At the time, 3,404 students had officially graduated. Colegio San Carlos has consistently ranked 1st among the ten most important schools in Colombia, and has earned notoriety in Maths, Biology, Chemistry and Physics performance on a national and international level.

Krebs, a higher archive official's son, did his Abitur in 1917 after finishing school at the Gymnasium in Aschaffenburg and thereafter reported to the military as a volunteer. He was not deployed in the First World War. Krebs was discharged in March 1919, leaving him free to begin studies in Germanistics, history, national economics, and English language in Würzburg, Tübingen, Marburg and Frankfurt am Main. Krebs had been busying himself in the youth movement even before the war. Furthermore, during his studies, he was in the Gildenschaft (a Studentenverbindung umbrella group) and in the Freikorps von Epp and Oberland in 1919. In 1922, he received his doctorate and, in the same year, he joined the Nazi party. In March 1925, Krebs was working at the Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfen-Verband (German National Trade Assistants' Federation; DHV) in Spandau in Berlin. After the reestablishment of the NSDAP, Krebs rejoined it on 10 May 1926 (Membership No. 35,589). On the resignation of Hamburg Gauleiter Josef Klant on 4 November 1926, Hamburg was downgraded from the status of a Nazi Gau. Krebs then was appointed Chairman (in effect, Ortsgruppenleiter) of the new \\"Independent Ortsgruppe Hamburg\\". After the Local Group was once again raised to Gau status on 26 February 1928, Krebs became Gauleiter of Gau Hamburg. After some infighting, in which Krebs did not feel he was being supported enough by the party leadership in Munich, he stepped down as Gauleiter on 3 September 1928. From 1929 to January 1931, Krebs was editor of the weekly Hamburger Volksblatt, the first Nazi newspaper in the city. In April 1930, Krebs took over the leadership of the Hamburg Betriebszellenorganisation, the Nazi Factory Cell Organization. A further career advance made it possible for him, starting in January 1931, to work as the first editor-in-chief of the Nazi daily newspaper Hamburger Tageblatt. As a member of the left wing of the Party, he was not comfortable with the Party leadership's move to accommodate more conservative and business interests. Owing to an article published early in 1932 that was critical of Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher's cabinet, Krebs was upbraided by Adolf Hitler personally, removed as editor and expelled from the Party on 20 May 1932. Professionally, he continued his activities as a national education and cultural consultant at the DHV until its dissolution in April 1934. Thereafter he worked as a freelancer at the German Office Workers' Union (Deutsche Angestellten- Gewerkschaft; DAG). From September 1934 to March 1938 he was the Director of the Hamburg Public Library. His last position was as Senate Director of the Hamburg Cultural Administration from April 1940 to July 1945. With the beginning of the Russian Campaign, Krebs was called up for service and assigned as special leader of the Propagandabteilung Ostland and took over cultural affairs in the cities of Riga and Tallinn. Through his acquaintance with Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg, to whom he had been introduced in 1942, Krebs knew in advance about the resistance's plans to overthrow the Führer and also about the attempt on Hitler's life. After it failed on 20 July 1944, he had to go underground. After the end of World War II, in Denazification proceedings, Krebs was banned from working as a journalist and lost his pension rights. On appeal, however, that ban was overturned in proceedings in October 1949. In his autobiographical chronicle, published in 1959, \\"Tendenzen und Gestalten der NSDAP\\" (\\"The NDSAP's Tendencies and Shapes\\"), Krebs portrayed himself as a contemporary who was at first impressed by Nazism's political ideas and goals, but who after personal experience with Hitler's dictatorial leadership style and the \\"incompetence in the NS Führer State\\" withdrew, disappointed, from political life.

The organization is responsible for some of the most audacious thefts in the history of theft and organized crime. They are responsible for what have been termed some of the most glamorous heists ever, and one criminologist even described their crimes as \\"artistry\\". They have operated in numerous countries and on several continents, and include Japan's most successful robbery amongst their thefts. A film documentary based upon their thefts, Smash & Grab, was released on 2 July 2013. Some law enforcement agencies suspect that the group is responsible for over US$500 million in robberies of gold and diamonds from the following countries: United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, Japan, France, Liechtenstein, Germany, United States of America, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Spain, Monaco, Austria and Australia, as well as Netherlands, Portugal and Belgium. Law enforcement authorities suspect their involvement in the heist of the jewelry store Harry Winston in Paris, on 9 December 2008. The thieves escaped with more than €80 million worth of jewelry.\\"Pink Panthers' Global Trail Littered with Jewels\\", New York Times, 12 December 2008. Raids Interpol has said it estimates that there are several hundred thieves in the group, and that many come from Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. However, other sources say the gang is suspected of having at least sixty members, around thirty of whom are thought to be from Montenegro. Several gang members are former soldiers with violent pasts. A great amount are fluent in many different languages and possess passports which have been given to others. In 2003, the gang first came to attention and earned the nickname \\"Pink Panthers\\" following the theft of a £500,000 diamond from a jewellers in the Mayfair area of central London in the United Kingdom. The thieves hid the diamond in a jar of face cream, mimicking an act seen in the film The Return of the Pink Panther. In May 2005, Graff, a diamond specialist in London, was targeted by Pink Panthers and lost a total of £1 million in jewellery. Three men were suspected of being behind the theft; one was in possession of a firearm. Graff had been targeted in 2002 and lost £23 million on that occasion, £3 million of which was recovered two years later. One of the thieves was sentenced to fifteen years in prison in July 2004. In the space of six years during the twenty-first century, the Pink Panthers robbed 120 stores in twenty different countries. Japan, London, Denmark, Monaco, Paris, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United States have all been targeted by the gang. Their attention to detail has ensured this high rate of success. Before robbing a jewellery store in Biarritz, the gang covered a nearby bench in fresh paint to deter anyone from sitting on it and seeing them in action. The gang is suspected of participating in at least two smash-and-grab jewellery robberies in Tokyo's Ginza district. The first, in 2004, netted ¥3.5 million in gems. The second, in June 2007, took jewellery valued at ¥284 million. In that heist, Rifat Hadžiahmetović and Radovan Jelušić sprayed tear gas at three saleswomen then took a tiara, necklaces, and other jewels and fled the store (see below for details of their subsequent arrest).Agence France-Presse/Jiji Press, \\"'Pink Panther' to face trial in Montenegro over 2007 Ginza heist\\", Japan Times, 21 May 2012, p. 1 The gang is also known for its daring escapes and attempts to break into their chosen store. They robbed a jewellery store in Saint-Tropez in 2005 wearing T-shirts emblazoned with flowery designs then made their escape on a speedboat. Prior to one 2008 robbery of Graff jewellers in Dubai, eight gang members drove a pair of Audis through a window, taking watches and other items worth a total of £8 million. In a further robbery, four gang members dressed themselves up as women in December 2008 before breaking into France's Harry Winston jewellers in Paris. The gang escaped from the store with items worth over US$100 million (£60 million). There is growing speculation that the US$65 million heist on 6 August 2009 of an exclusive London jewellery store was the work of the same group. A key element in the speculation is that the men who looted Graff Diamonds on New Bond Street made no effort to hide their faces, suggesting that they had been able to alter their looks with \\"Mission Impossible\\" style prosthetic make-up. In 2013, the gang was suspected to have struck again when a man wearing a baseball cap and a scarf covering his face broke into the Carlton Hotel in Cannes and made off with US$136 million worth of diamonds, gems, and jewelry being stored by the Leviev diamond house for an exhibit (see Carlton Intercontinental Hotel heist). Nice-Matin speculated that this may have been the most costly jewelry theft in history. Arrests and breakouts The thieves have been identified and linked through DNA matching, according to Interpol. In 2005, three Serbs, two men and one woman, were arrested in Belgrade. In October 2007, they were sentenced to jail terms by a court in Serbia for the theft of the Comtesse de Vendome necklace, worth approximately £15 million (US$30 million), from a Tokyo jewellery boutique, in what was Japan's biggest ever jewel robbery in March 2004. The gang leader was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment while the other two were handed lesser sentences. Three Pink Panthers from Serbia were declared guilty of robberies carried out in Biarritz, Cannes, Courchevel and Saint-Tropez by one court in Chambéry in 2008. Two were given jail-terms of six and ten years. One suspect in a June 2007 Ginza heist, a Montenegrin-national named Rifat Hadžiahmetović, travelling on a forged Bulgarian passport, was arrested in March 2009 by Cypriot police at Larnaca International Airport. Hadžiahmetović was due to serve a sentence in Cyprus for travelling on a forged passport before being extradited to Spain. He was extradited from Spain to Japan and, in September 2011, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His accomplice, Radovan Jelušić, was arrested in Italy in 2010 over a separate crime, then was extradited to Montenegro to stand trial on 18 May 2012. On 20 June 2009, French police in Monte Carlo detained another three members of the gang seen loitering near jewellery shops in Monaco. The gang members drove up outside a casino in Casino Square on 18 June 2009. The men were told to lie down and were then handcuffed before being whisked away from the scene quickly. One of the three arrested, Dragan Mikić, is of special interest to the police investigation. He is from Serbia and is on the Interpol's \\"Most Wanted\\" list, possibly being a senior member of the Pink Panthers. Mikić has been on the run since 2005 after breaking out of jail via a ladder whilst other people fired machine guns at the prison. A head figure of the Pink Panthers, Mitar Marjanović, was arrested on 8 March 2012 in Rome, after two of his accomplices in a bank robbery, committed a month earlier, dropped stolen items containing Marjanovic's fingerprints. On 14 March 2012, three more members of the gang were arrested in Athens, Greece. Two of the three were male Serbians, aged 20 and 36, and were arrested while reconnoitering a jewellery store robbery. Patrolling police were prompted to question them due to their wearing wigs. The two men fled and the 36-year-old fired and injured a police officer during the pursuit that followed. Both were arrested and led the police to the arrest of the third person, a 43-year-old Serbian female, Olivera Vasić Ćirković. On 12 July 2012 Olivera escaped from Athens' prison when a man who entered the prison on the pretext of delivering art supplies knocked out a guard and stole her keys. On 14 May 2013, a member of the gang escaped from the \\"Bois-Mermet\\" prison in Lausanne, Switzerland. He has not yet been caught. He escaped with the help of three outside accomplices who meticulously prepared the operation. Four other prisoners got away at the same time. On 25 July 2013, Milan Poparić, who was serving a sentence of almost seven years for a 2009 robbery at a jewellery store, was the third Pink Panther to escape from a Swiss prison since May 2013. Also escaping was Swiss kidnapper, arsonist and money launderer Adrian Albrecht. They were helped out of the prison at Orbe, in western Switzerland, by accomplices who broke through the perimeter fence and brought ladders for the escapees while keeping the prison guards at bay with fire from AK-47s.

It is situated on the river Alsenz, approx. north of Kaiserslautern. Rockenhausen is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Nordpfälzer Land. The town consists the villages Marienthal, Dörnbach, and Rockenhausen itself. History Rockenhausen received its town charter in 1332. At that time subordinated to the Raugrafen, the town belonged to the Electoral Palatinate from 1457. During the Thirty Years' War, it was almost completely destroyed, as were almost all other villages in the region. After 1792 the region was occupied by French troops in the First Revolutionary War and annexed after the peace of Campo Formio (1797). From 1798 to 1814 Rockenhausen belonged to the French department Donnersberg and was the capital (chef-lieu) of the canton Rockenhausen. Due to the agreements made at the Congress of Vienna (1815) and an exchange contract with Austria, the region became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816. From 1818 Rockenhausen was assigned to the Landkommissariat Kirchheim in the Bavarian Rheinkreis, later to the Bezirksamt Kirchheimbolanden. On 1 December 1900 the district office Rockenhausen was formed from parts of the district offices Kirchheimbolanden and Kaiserslautern. On January 1, 1939, the district office was renamed into the district of Rockenhausen.[4] After the Second World War, Rockenhausen became part of the newly formed state of Rhineland-Palatinate within the French occupation zone and belonged to the administrative district of Palatinate until 1968. On 7 June 1969, the district of Rockenhausen was united with the district of Kirchheimbolanden to form today's Donnersberg district. On 10 June 1979, the previously independent municipalities of Dörnbach with 550 inhabitants and Marienthal/Pfalz with 280 inhabitants were incorporated into the town.

A stone tool, circular in shape with a hole in the middle, was found alongside the jar, though it was never dated. Pottery sherds from the Hellenistic, early and late Roman and the Byzantine eras have been found here. A sacred cave exists above the village on the south, which is probably an ancient rock-cut chapel.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, vol 2, p. 185 Aaron Demsky noted that the town is mentioned in the 3rd century Mosaic of Rehob.Aaron Demsky, The Permitted Villages of Sebaste in the Reḥov Mosaic, Israel Exploration Journal (vol. 29, no. 3/4), Jerusalem 1979, p. 190. The village is also mentioned in Crusader sources of 1178,Rey, 1883, p. 426 as a place sold to the Knights Hospitallers. Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229) noted it as \\"a village belonging to and lying among the hills of Nablus.\\"Le Strange, 1890, p. 441; cited in Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, ARP vol 2, pp. 336-337 Pottery sherds from the early Muslim and Medieval eras have also been found here. Ottoman era Sanur can be seen in the background In 1596 Fandaqumiyya appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as being in the nahiya of Jabal Sami, part of the Sanjak of Nablus. It had a population of eleven households and one bachelor, all Muslim. The inhabitants paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues and a press for olives or grapes; a total of 11,752 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 125. Fandaqumiya was mentioned by the Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi in 1640. In 1830, during the military campaign against a revolt by the Jarrar clan of Sanur, Emir Bashir Shihab's forces set fire to Fandaqumiya. In 1838, Edward Robinson passed by and noted it as a being a small village,Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol.3, pp. 150-151 located in the esh-Sharawiyeh esh-Shurkiyeh (the Eastern) district, north of Nablus.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, 2nd Appendix, p. 129 French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village in 1863 and 1870, and estimated it as having about 500 inhabitants. He describes it as being situated on the slopes of a high hill. With abundant waters, the whole slope was cultivated with beautiful olive trees, figs and pomegranates.Guérin, 1875, pp. 216-217 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Fandaqumiya as \\"a very small village on the slope of the hill, with three springs to the south-west, small and marshy.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, vol 2, p. 155 A spur of the Ottoman Hejaz railway to Damascus was built through the area, and a station was opened nearby at Sebastia. After the collapse of the Ottomans, locals took apart the rail infrastructure for secondary use in construction. Many of the steel beams can still be seen in the roofs of local homes. British Mandate era In 1917, Fandaqumiya was captured by General Allenby's British forces from the Ottomans, and three years later it was assigned to British Mandatory Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Fandaqumiya had a population of 327, all Muslims.Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub-district of Jenin, p. 29 This increased in the 1931 census to a population of 445, still all Muslim, living in 101 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 68 Soon after the British arrived, they built a police fort on a nearby hill. Despite many villagers being employed in the construction, relations with the British forces were at times rocky owing to tax disputes. During the riots of 1936-1939, some villagers launched attacks on the British troops, and the village was subject to British reprisals. During the 1940s, the British administration funded modern water and agriculture development projects as well as an elementary school. In the 1945 statistics the population was 630 Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 16 with 4,079 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

The rarer isotopes nickel-62 and iron-58, which both have higher binding energies, are not shown. Iron-56 (56Fe) is the most common isotope of iron. About 91.754% of all iron is iron-56. Of all nuclides, iron-56 has the lowest mass per nucleon. With 8.8 MeV binding energy per nucleon, iron-56 is one of the most tightly bound nuclei.Nuclear Binding Energy Nickel-62, a relatively rare isotope of nickel, has a higher nuclear binding energy per nucleon; this is consistent with having a higher mass-per- nucleon because nickel-62 has a greater proportion of neutrons, which are slightly more massive than protons. (See the nickel-62 article for more). Light elements undergoing nuclear fusion and heavy elements undergoing nuclear fission release energy as their nucleons bind more tightly, so 62Ni might be expected to be common. However, during nucleosynthesis in stars the competition between photodisintegration and alpha capturing causes more 56Ni to be produced than 62Ni (56Fe is produced later in the star's ejection shell as 56Ni decays). Production of these elements has decreased considerably from what it was at the beginning of the stelliferous era. Nonetheless, 28 atoms of nickel-62 fusing into 31 atoms of iron-56 releases of energy. As the Universe ages, matter will slowly convert to ever more tightly bound nuclei, approaching 56Fe, ultimately leading to the formation of iron stars over ≈101500 years in an expanding universe without proton decay.

History Originally, the council comprised six members— Alexander Menshikov, Fyodor Apraksin, Gavriil Golovkin, Andrey Osterman, Peter Tolstoy, and Dmitry Mikhaylovich Golitsyn. Several months later, Catherine's son-in- law, Karl Friedrich, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, joined the Council. During Catherine's reign (1725-1727), her favorite, Prince Menshikov, dominated the Council. In her testament the Empress Catherine I authorized the Council to wield power equal to that of her successor Peter II, except in matters of succession. Peter II, Catherine's step-grandson, assumed the throne on 6 May 1727; Menshikov organised for the 11-year-old Peter to become engaged to his 15-year-old daughter Maria Alexandrovna Menshikova (25 May 1727). By the time of Menshikov's downfall in September 1727 the Council's make-up had changed drastically: Apraksin had died, Tolstoy had been exiled, and the Duke of Holstein had left Russia. Thereupon the Council expanded to eight members, of which six represented old boyar families opposing the Westernization reforms of Peter the Great—the Dolgorukovs and the Golitsyns. Osterman and Golovkin retained the other two seats. As the conservative influence prevailed among its members, the Council, although nominally a consultative body, monopolized supreme power and had the imperial capital moved de facto back to Moscow. . The collegia (i.e., ministries) and the Senate, instituted by Peter the Great as supreme governing bodies, were held accountable before the Council rather than to the young Emperor. The Senate was renamed from \\"Governing\\" to \\"High\\". After Peter II's death in 1730, the Council chose a rather improbable successor—the daughter of Tsar Ivan V, Anna Ivanovna, Duchess of Courland, whom they deemed easily amenable to manipulation and too conservative to restore Peter I's reforms. Anna was allowed to ascend the throne only after she had signed the famous \\"Conditions\\" which conferred on the Council the powers of war and peace and of taxation. According to the Conditions, Anna couldn't promote officers to ranks higher than colonel or interfere in military affairs. She promised not to marry and not to choose her successor. The Council modelled the Conditions on the form of government recently instituted in Great Britain. If implemented, they could have led to Russia's transformation into a constitutional monarchy. If she were to violate the Conditions, Anna was to be dethroned. Menshikov in Beryozovo, Vasily Surikov A month after signing the document, on 25 February 1730, Anna, on the advice of her close counsellor, Ernst Johann von Biron, won the sympathies of the Leib Guard and tore up the terms of her accession. Within days, the Council was abolished and many of its members were exiled to Siberia.

Owing its lineage to the successful line of sesquiplane fighters that included the Nieuport 17, the Nieuport 28 continued a similar design philosophy of a lightweight and highly maneuverable aircraft. By the time the Nieuport 28 was available, the SPAD XIII had been chosen to equip the escadrilles de chasse of the Aéronautique Militaire for 1918, and this fighter was also the first choice for the projected American \\"pursuit\\" squadrons.Hamady 2008, p. 47. In the event, a shortage of SPADs led to Nieuport 28s being issued to four American squadrons between March and August 1918, becoming the first aircraft to see operational service with an American fighter squadron. Nieuport 28s saw considerable post-war service: in particular 50 were \\"returned\\" to America, and as well as army and naval service these found civilian use, especially in Hollywood films. Development Background and origins By the middle of 1917, it was obvious that the Nieuport 17 and its immediate developments, such as the Nieuport 24bis, could provide only moderate performance gains over the standard model, so that they were unable to deal with the latest German fighters. In fact, the Nieuport 17 line was already being supplanted in French service by the SPAD S.VII,Cheesman 1960, p. 94. as quickly as supplies of the Hispano-Suiza engine would allow. It had become increasingly apparent that the basic sesquiplane \\"v-strut\\" layout was approaching the limits of its development.Bowers 1966, pp. 4-5. The Nieuport 28 design advanced the concept of the lightly built, highly maneuverable rotary engined fighter typified by the Nieuport 17 to the more demanding conditions of the times. Bowers refers to it as being \\"an excellent example of the step-by-step evolution of a single basic design to its point of ultimate development and then its transition into a new model to meet changing requirements\\".Bowers 1966, p. 3. Prototypes During 1917 the Nieuport company experimented with a number of new designs - including monoplanes, biplanes and triplanes. None of these types achieved production status and thus never received an official military designation, but the results of tests provided information later used in future Nieuport fighters, including the 28.Hamady 2008, p. 193. Several prototypes of the new fighter were constructed. Three different dihedral settings for the top wing were tried, including a completely flat wing, and one with marked dihedral that rested very close to the top of the front fuselage. Production aircraft featured an intermediate configuration, which involved a slight dihedral in the upper wing and taller cabane struts, providing room to accommodate a second machine gun, mounted under the wing's center section.Hamady 2008, Appendix B pp. 193–203. Additional prototypes based on the design of the N28 were built to test various features of the Nieuport 29, including its wooden monocoque fuselage,Davilla 1997, p. 407. and alternate engine installations, such as the 300 hp Hispano-Suiza 8Fb, 170 hp Le Rhône 9R, 275 hp Lorraine- Dietrich 8Bd,Davilla 1997, pp. 409–410. and 200 hp Clerget 11E. Design The Nieuport 28's design featured several improvements over the 27, including the adoption of a more powerful engine, a twin-machine gun armament, and a new wing structure.Bowers 1966, p. 5. For the first time, a production Nieuport fighter was fitted with conventional two-spar wings, top and bottom, in place of the sesquiplane \\"v-strut\\" layout of the earlier Nieuports.Bowers 1966, pp. 3, 5. Both wings featured elliptical wingtips, instead of the angular raked tips common to Nieuport's earlier works. The upper wing was built in two sections, joined together over the fuselage center-line. The leading edge of both wings was a plywood structure, which proved to be structurally weak in later service. Ailerons, which were controlled via an arrangement of torque tubes, were fitted to the lower wings only. In order to provide a more streamlined profile, the fuselage was longer and slimmer, so narrow that its twin Vickers machine guns were offset to port, one between the cabane struts and one just outboard of them. National Air and Space Museum, Retrieved: 30 August 2009.Bowers 1966, pp. 5-6. The design of the tail unit closely followed that of the Nieuport 27. Operational history Starting Nieuport 28s of the 95th Aero Squadron for a patrol By early 1918, when the first production examples of the Nieuport 28 became available, the SPAD S.XIII was already firmly established as the standard French fighter, and the Nieuport 28 was \\"surplus\\" from the French point of view.Cheesman 1960, p. 106. On the other hand, the United States Army Air Service was desperately short of fighters to equip its projected \\"pursuit\\" (fighter) squadrons. Since the SPAD S.XIIIs the Americans actually wanted were initially unavailable due to engine shortages, the Nieuport was offered to the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) as an interim alternative.Hamady 2008, pp. 38–49.Davilla 1997, p. 502. A total of 297 Nieuport 28s were purchased by the Americans (none of our sources make it clear if this refers only to the initial order or includes Nieuport 28A trainers accepted from the late 1918 contract). The 94th and 95th Aero Squadron received the initial allotments, starting in March 1918.Dorr and Donald 1990, pp. 16–17. In all, four AEF pursuit squadrons: the 27th, 94th, 95th and 147th Aero Squadrons, flew Nieuport 28s operationally for various periods between March and August 1918.Davilla 1997, p. 408.Guttman 1992, pp. 5, 8. Rickenbacker with his Nieuport 28 – note offset guns The factory delivered the Nieuport 28s to the Americans in mid-February 1918 without armament.Bowers 1966, pp. 9-10. At the time, the AEF had no spare Vickers machine guns to supply to the squadrons, so that the first flights were unarmed training flights for pilots to familiarize themselves with the handling and performance of the new type. When deliveries of Vickers guns to the American squadrons finally started in mid-March, and until sufficient guns had been received for all of the fighters to be fully equipped, some aircraft were flown on patrol with only one machine gun fitted.Treadwell 2000, p. 68. On 14 April 1918, the second armed patrol of an AEF fighter unit resulted in two victories when Lieutenants Alan Winslow and Douglas Campbell (the first American-trained ace) of the 94th Aero Squadron each downed an enemy aircraft over their own airfield at Gengoult.Hamady 2008, p. 10.Bowers 1966, p. 10. Several well-known World War I American fighter pilots, including the 26-victory ace, Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, began their operational careers on the Nieuport 28.Treadwell 2000, pp. 68, 75. Quentin Roosevelt (the son of former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt) was shot down and killed flying the type. The 94th and 95th had the task of dealing with the type's teething troubles. Initially undercarriages failed on landing – this was corrected by using heavier bracing wire. The Nieuport 28's 160 hp Gnome 9N rotary engine and fuel system proved to be unreliable and prone to fires.Guttman 1992, pp. 7–8. Field improvements to fuel lines, and increased familiarity of the American pilots (and their ground crews) with the requirements of monosoupape engines reduced these problems, but the definitive solution adopted was simply not completely filling the reserve fuel tank, a move which came at the expense of range. More seriously, a structural problem emerged – during a sharp pull out from a steep dive, the plywood leading edge of the top wing could break away, taking the fabric with it.Hamady 2008, Appendix D\\" pp. 230–240.(This is the definitive study of the problem) On the whole, although the pilots of the 94th and the 95th appreciated the maneuverability and good handling of the Nieuport, and were reasonably happy with its general performance, their confidence in the fighter's structural integrity was shaken.Hamady 2008, p. 65. USS Arizona The 27th and 147th Aero Squadrons arrived at the front three months later, starting combat operations on 2 June 1918.Guttman 2008, p. 31. In July 1918, the 94th and 95th Aero Squadrons received their first SPAD XIIIs and some of their surviving Nieuport 28s were then transferred to the 27th and 147th Aero Squadrons. By the end of August 1918, all four American squadrons were fully outfitted with SPAD XIIIs.Hartney 1971, p. 182. The pilots of the 94th and 95th Aero Squadrons welcomed the SPADs, although the 27th and 147th Aero Squadrons were much less enthusiastic about the change.Guttman 1992, p. 10. The Nieuport 28 certainly possessed superior maneuverability to its SPAD replacement.Bowers 1966, pp. 10-12. Twelve of the Army Nieuports were transferred to the U.S. Navy to be flown from launching platforms mounted above the forward turrets of eight battleships, in the manner of the Sopwith Camel 2F.1s embarked at this time by the British Grand Fleet. In Royal Navy fashion, they were fitted with hydrovanes as a means of mitigating the dangers of \\"ditching\\" at the end of a mission, and flotation gear, inflated using compressed air, to facilitate salvage of the aircraft.Cooksley 1997, p. 48. Nieuport 28A During late 1918, about the time that the type was withdrawn from front line use, the United States Army placed an order for an additional 600 improved Nieuport 28s, which were given the American designation 28A. Although these were mainly intended as advanced trainers, early problems with the SPAD S.XIII in American service meant that the possibility of re-introducing the Nieuport fighters into the operational squadrons was not discounted, and provision was made for the installation of twin M1917/M1918 Marlin guns, mounted side by side under the center section.Hamady 2008, pp. 112–113.Bowers 1966, p. 6. The Nieuport 28A was to feature an improved upper wing leading edge structure and a redesigned fuel system, correcting faults in the initial production batch. As the Nieuport company were preoccupied with later types, production was undertaken by Lioré et Olivier who had built 170 Nieuport 28As and parts for another 100 by the end of the war, when the remainder of the order was cancelled.Hamady 2008, p. 113. Nieuport 28A advertising Nucoa margarine after the war in the US Postwar Postwar, approximately 50 new Nieuport 28As which had not previously seen service were shipped to the U.S. During the 1920s, Nieuport 28s were also in service with various air forces; Switzerland obtained 15, while Argentina received a couple of aircraft.van Leeuwen, Marcel. \\"Nieuport 28.\\" zap16.com, 30 December 2008.

The Dawn Patrol stars Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Richard Barthelmess, and Gardner James with a Nieuport 28 The type also found its way into civilian use. Several were used for aerial races; Nieuport 28 racers were often modified by reducing the wing span by up to five feet and replacing the parallel wing struts with a single 'I'-shaped strut. During the same period, a number of Nieuport 28s made their way to Hollywood where they appeared in the movies, The Dawn Patrol (1930), as well as its remake in 1938, Ace of Aces (1933) and Men with Wings (1938).Hardwick and Schnepf 1989, pp. 56, 58–59.

After the House of Representatives election committee canvassed over 1,300 votes Fitzgerald's plurality went down to 10 votes. After determining that one-third of the votes in three precincts of Boston's Ward 5 were fraudulent, the committee threw out the votes of those precincts. The committee determined that the election had been tainted by illegal registrations and fraud. They determined that Tague won the election by 525 votes. On October 2, 1919, by a vote of 5 to 2, the committee voted to unseat Fitzgerald and to seat Tague. On October 23, 1919, the full House of Representatives unseated Fitzgerald and seated Tague. Tague was reelected to the Sixty-seventh and Sixty-eighth Congresses, serving from October 23, 1919, to March 3, 1925. Tague is noted for having introduced a bill in Congress in 1921 to investigate the KKK, which then was becoming a powerful force nationwide. He was defeated for reelection in 1924. Boston mayoral candidate Tague was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of Boston in December 1917, finishing fourth in a field of four candidates; the election was won by Andrew James Peters.  Later years  Following his defeat for Congress in 1924, Tague resumed his business career. He was appointed assessor of Boston in 1930 and chairman of the election commission of Boston the same year. In 1936, he was appointed postmaster and served until his death. Tague died in Boston on September 17, 1941, at the age of 70. He was interred in Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, Massachusetts.

The club was founded in 1967 and currently competes in the National Premier Leagues Queensland, with home matches played at Goodwin Park. The club has grown tremendously in the past 15 years growing from 190 registered players to over 855 players. The current head coach is Ben Cahn. History Olympic FC was founded in 1967 by Greek immigrants, under the name Pan Rhodian Soccer Club, affiliated with Queensland Soccer Association. The following year the club joined the Queensland Soccer Federation, changing its name to Brisbane Olympic United as a condition of joining the federation. The club colours were originally blue and white until changing to red and white in the late 2000s. In 2008, the club again changed its name to Olympic FC upon joining the Queensland State League (QSL). After playing in the QSL in 2008 and 2009, the club elected to play in the Brisbane Premier League for the 2010 season. The Queensland State League was ultimately superseded by the National Premier Leagues competition. In 2013, Olympic FC was awarded a licence to compete in the inaugural Queensland National Premier Leagues season, a recognition of the club's stature in the state. The NPL is Australia's second highest footballing tier. Club Performance Olympic has won NPL Queensland competition on one occasion. In the competition's inaugural 2013 season, Olympic secured a league premiership with two rounds remaining, defeating Moreton Bay United 3–1. Olympic FC then secured a victory over Brisbane City 3–3 (3–0) on penalties in the NPL Queensland Grand Final at Goodwin Park. Since 2013, Olympic FC has continued to perform well in the competition, securing multiple top table finishes. The club lost 2–1 to Lions FC again in the 2018 NPL Queensland Grand Final at Lions Stadium. Olympic FC has played in the national rounds of the FFA Cup on two occasion. The club qualified in 2014, progressing to the Round of 16 before losing narrowly to the Central Coast Mariners, an A-League, professional side. The club qualified again in 2018, but lost to local rivals Lions FC in the Round of 32.  Home Ground  Olympic FC first played at Pineapple Park, a field near the Gabba Cricket Ground in Kangaroo Point. In the 1970s, Olympic moved to Dutton Park. In 1982, the club moved to the current home ground in Yeronga, Goodwin Park. Notable Players Olympic FC has developed notable players. Michael Zullo, A-League champion and Socceroo, played for Olympic FC as a boy. Jai Ingham and Dane Ingham both spent formative years at the club before playing professionally in the A-League.

The SLR to be maintained by banks is determined by the RBI in order to control the expansion. The SLR is determined as a percentage of total demand and time liabilities. Time liabilities refer to the liabilities which the commercial banks are liable to repay to the customers after an agreed period, and demand liabilities are customer deposits which are repayable on demand. An example of a time liability is a six-month fixed deposit which is not payable on demand but only after six months. An example of a demand liability is a deposit maintained in a saving account or current account that is payable on demand. The SLR is commonly used to control inflation and fuel growth, by decreasing or increasing the money supply. Indian banks' holdings of government securities are now close to the statutory minimum that banks are required to hold to comply with existing regulation. When measured in rupees, such holdings decreased for the first time in a little less than 40 years (since the nationalisation of banks in 1969) in 2005–06. It is 18.00 percent as on June 2020. Usage SLR is used by bankers and indicates the minimum percentage of deposits that the bank has to maintain in form of gold, cash or other approved securities. Thus, we can say that it is ratio of cash and some other approved liability (deposits). It regulates the credit growth in India. The liabilities that the banks are liable to pay within one month's time, due to completion of maturity period, are also considered as time liabilities. The maximum limit of SLR is 40% and minimum limit of SLR is 0 In India, Reserve Bank of India always determines the percentage of SLR. There are some statutory requirements for temporarily placing the money in government bonds. Following this requirement, Reserve Bank of India fixes the level of SLR. However, as most banks currently keep an SLR higher than required (>26%) due to lack of credible lending options, near term reductions are unlikely to increase liquidity and are more symbolic. The SLR is fixed for a number of reasons. The chief driving force is increasing or decreasing liquidity which can result in a desired outcome. A few uses of mandating SLR are: *Controlling the expansion of bank credit. By changing the level of SLR, the Reserve Bank of India can increase or decrease bank credit expansion. *Ensuring the solvency of commercial banks *By reducing the level of SLR, the RBI can increase liquidity with the commercial banks, resulting in increased investment. This is done to fuel growth and demand. *Compelling the commercial banks to invest in government securities like government bonds If any Indian bank fails to maintain the required level of the statutory liquidity ratio, then it becomes liable to pay penalty to Reserve Bank of India. The defaulter bank pays penal interest at the rate of 3% per annum above the bank rate, on the shortfall amount for that particular day. However, according to the Circular released by the Department of Banking Operations and Development, Reserve Bank of India, if the defaulter bank continues to default on the next working day, then the rate of penal interest can be increased to 5% per annum above the bank rate. This restriction is imposed by RBI on banks to make funds available to customers on demand as soon as possible. Gold and government securities (or gilts) are included along with cash because they are highly liquid and safe assets. The RBI can increase the SLR to control inflation, suck liquidity in the market, to tighten the measure to safeguard the customers' money. Decrease in SLR rate is done to encourage growth. In a growing economy banks would like to invest in stock market, not in government securities or gold as the latter would yield less returns. One more reason is long term government securities (or any bond) are sensitive to interest rate changes. However, in an emerging economy, interest rate change is a common activity. Value and formula The quantum is specified as some percentage of the total demand and time liabilities ( i.e. the liabilities of the bank which are payable on demand anytime, and those liabilities which are accruing in one months time due to maturity) of a bank. SLR rate = (liquid assets / (demand + time liabilities)) × 100% This percentage is fixed by the Reserve Bank of India. The maximum limit for the SLR was 40% in India.Master Circular of RBI to banks http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/55663.pdf Following the amendment of the Banking regulation Act (1949) in January 2017, the floor rate of 20.75% for SLR was removed.

June Mountain, like its neighbor and current owner, Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, has traditionally been popular with skiers from Southern California, in part because of its relative ease of automobile access in winter compared to the Lake Tahoe resorts, which are traditionally more accessible to Northern California residents. It is also popular with locals, elementary and high school ski programs, and race teams in the surrounding small towns of Mono County, many of whom depend on the resort for a substantial portion of their winter tourism base. June Mountain hosted the 2006 Ski Mountaineering Race Series and the ski and snowboard portions of the 2006 California Winter Games in March 2006. June Mountain also offers chair lift rides to the chalet throughout the summer and contains hiking trails and other scenic features that are accessible throughout the summer months. On June 21, 2012, Mammoth Mountain and the Starwood Capital Group announced that they would close June Mountain for the summer and winter 2012–2013 season, after 50 years of continuous operation. An active citizen movement arose in response, raising concerns about the prospects for sustaining the local community if the mountain closed. With a new strategy to finally invest in snowmaking, a chairlift, and marketing, June Mountain re-opened for the 2013–2014 season. In 2014, Mammoth Mountain purchased Bear Mountain and Snow Summit for $38 million. In 2017, Mammoth Resorts announced its sale by Starwood to a partnership of Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners, later named Alterra Mountain Company. Ski lifts June Mountain operates 7 ski lifts, 2 high-speed quads, 4 doubles, and 1 people mover for beginners. In 1996, Doppelmayr retrofitted the two high-speed quads, introducing new grips and other technological improvements. Most of the double chairlifts were built by Riblet and retrofitted by Lift Engineering (Yan Lifts). Chair J1, a double chair, carries skiers and snowboarders from the lower ticket office up to June Meadows Chalet where most amenities the resort has to offer are located. From the chalet, riders can either head down the challenging front face of the resort back to the lower ticket office and parking lot or continue to the more intermediate upper mountain. Chair J6, a high speed quad lift, provides direct access to the top of Rainbow Mountain and a variety of intermediate runs. The other lift option from the chalet is chair J2 which leads to Stew Pot Slims, where food and beverages are available, and gives skiers and snowboarders access to the smaller of the two terrain parks on the mountain as well the 22 foot superpipe. From the top of chair J2, chair J4, and chair J7. Chair J4 also leads to the summit of Rainbow Mountain while chair J7 goes to the top of June Mountain and provides access to some of the more iconic runs on the mountain in addition to the largest terrain park found in the resort. The total uphill capacity of the lifts at June Mountain is 10,000 rides per hour. Mountains View of the ski slopes at June June Mountain ski area consists of two mountains, Rainbow Mountain, with an elevation of 10,040 feet (3,060 m), and June Mountain, with a peak of 10,090 feet (3,075 m). The total vertical rise from the lower ticket office to the summit of June Mountain is 2,545 feet. June Mountain averages 250 inches of snowfall a year along with some snowmaking capabilities and normal season runs from December through April. The ski area covers 1,500 acres and has 35 named trails of which 20% are advanced, 45% are intermediate, and 35% are beginner. June Mountain is also home to two terrain parks and a 22 foot superpipe. Many opportunities exist, however, for riders to explore the trees that cover much of the ski areas total acreage and access fresh snow off piste. June Mountain has also established itself as a favorite spot among locals due to its small crowds and easy access to powder following a storm. Backcountry The lifts at June Mountain Ski Resort also give riders access to multiple backcountry ski locations that would normally require an all day hike to reach. Examples of these backcountry zones are San Joaquin Ridge, the Negatives, Fern Creek, Carson Peak, Devil’s Slide, and Four Seasons. Due to the location of the resort, 5,000 foot descents are easily available with only 2,000 feet of ascending by skis. Because of this and the variety of backcountry terrain found in the immediate proximity of the resort, June Mountain is considered to have some of the best lift accessed backcountry in the West. Services Most of the mountain's services are found at June Meadows chalet, at the top of chair J1. Services include a restaurant and a renowned bar. It is also the home of the ski school, a general merchandise shop, and a ski shop, supplying skis, snowboards, and their requirements. Another restaurant on the mountain, \\"Stew Pots Slim's\\", located at the base of chair J7, is popular with more advanced skiers, for its location next to the terrain parks and June Mountain's many advanced runs. It serves drinks, sandwiches, soups and chili. Other Looking down upon June from the top June Mountain has some snowmaking, but it is rarely used, for the mountain averages about 250 inches (6.4 m) of snowfall per year. It also has a small grooming fleet for the terrain park and trails. June Mountain used to be home to the QMC, or Quad Monocable Tramway, a type of gondola similar to a funitel or funifor. It was built by Yan Lifts (Lift Engineering), but was removed in 1996 due to technical problems. It was bought by Dave McCoy in 1986, owner of Mammoth Mountain. The ski resort is now owned by Mammoth Mountain Ski resort.

In 1881, Walton created a method for reducing the environmental hazards of the smoke emitted from locomotive, industrial and residential chimneys. Her system deflected the emissions being produced by factory smokestacks into water tanks, where the pollutants were retained and later flushed \\"into the sewer, or into other suitable channels for conducting them to a distant or any desired locality\\".Walton, Mary E.

Walton had chosen to pursue a solution after hearing that young Thomas Edison had tried and failed. After experimentation and research, she was able to narrow down that much of the sound was a result of amplification from wooden support boxes. To test various solutions, she built a model of the tracks in her basement. From these tests, she determined that lining the boxes with cotton and filling them with sand served to effectively dampen the sound of the trains. Her system deadened the noise caused by trains running over the tracks by cradling the tracks in a wooden box lined with cotton and filled with sand.Walton, Mary E. (1881).

Domesday Map Online: Long Sutton. A flood in 1236 that destroyed Wisbech Castle is also said to have washed away the village of Dolproon (or Dolprun) near Long Sutton and its existence has been handed down in the lines: \\"When Dolproon stood, Long Sutton was a wood. When Dolproon was washed down, Long Sutton became a town.\\" The Friday market dates back to the early 13th century when the town was a prosperous trading centre. By the mid-14th century, it was considered to be one of the richest communities in Lincolnshire. Prosperity continued into the 20th century, helped by the arrival of the railways. In the 1950s eleven trains would daily transport passengers and local produce to and from the town. Long Sutton railway station on the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway closed in 1959 when passenger services were withdrawn. In 1987 a Butterfly Park was opened near Long Sutton. The park was closed in October 2012 after a series of losses and bad weather. On 21 June 2012, at about 2:30 pm, a tornado hit Long Sutton.

Food canning factory One of the largest employers in the area since the 1940s was the food-canning factory of Lockwoods Foods Limited, on Bridge Road between Sutton Bridge and Long Sutton. Lockwoods produced a wide range of own-brand canned food and drink products, ranging from canned mushy peas to seasonal strawberries, cola to ginger beer and lemonade shandy to name a few, for both the domestic UK and overseas markets, including third-party brands such as Del Monte. During the 1980s, the factory was purchased by Premier Foods when Lockwoods Foods Limited went into administrative receivership. Premier Foods, among other popular food brands, would later produce the popular staple food Fray Bentos canned steak and kidney pie at the Long Sutton factory.

It is situated on the upper course of the river Alsenz, approx. north-east of Kaiserslautern. Winnweiler is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Winnweiler. Winnweiler station is on the Alsenz Valley Railway (Alsenztalbahn), running between Hochspeyer and Bad Münster am Stein. The settlement in Rhenish Franconia was first mentioned in an 891 deed, from the 12th century onwards it was a possession of the Counts of Falkenstein. As a Lorraine exclave it fell to the House of Habsburg upon the marriage of Maria Theresa of Austria with Duke Francis III Stephen in 1736. It was thereafter administered as an Oberamt of Further Austria until its occupation by French troops in 1797. Geography Winnweiler is located in the Saar-Nahe-Bergland and on the edge of the Donnersberg nature reserve. The municipality is divided into the following districts * Alsenbrück-Langmeil with the living quarters Bahnhof Langmeil, Salomonsmühle, Sattelhof, Wäschbacherhof and Ziegelhütte * with the residential areas Eisenschmelz, Kahlheckerhof and Kupferschmelz * Potzbach with the Leithöfe residential area * Winnweiler with the residential areas Igelbornerhöhe and chapel Culture and sights To the east of Winnweiler on the Leisbühl stands a listed war memorial built in 1933, in whose half-open hall a larger-than-life soldier figure as well as commemorative plaques with the names of fallen soldiers commemorate the two world wars. At the northern corner of the square building there is an attached 12.5 m high stair tower leading to an 8.5 m high viewing platform above the hall. From here you have a good view towards Winnweiler and the surrounding area. Economy and infrastructure Traffic Winnweiler is connected to the national road network via the Federal Motorway 63 (Mainz- Kaiserslautern) and the Federal Road 48 (Bingen am Rhein-Bad Bergzabern). The Bingen-Winnweiler section was already a national road (R 40). There was also a station on the Alsenztalbahn (Kaiserslautern-Bingen) in Langmeil, which, however, has not been served since December 2006, as demand had fallen sharply due to the better locations of the Winnweiler and Enkenbach stations and the opening of the Münchweiler stop on the Alsenz in 1999. Here the Zellertalbahn (Monsheim-Langmeil) branches off. This line has been used for some years on Sundays and public holidays in summer again for the excursion traffic. The trains run from Monsheim via Langmeil to Hochspeyer. Education In addition to the Montessori primary school, the town also offers the Realschule plus Albert-Schweitzer-Schule. There is also the Wilhelm-Erb-Gymnasium, a former Latin school. The next university town is Kaiserslautern. Sports Winnweiler is served by a local sports club, ASV Winnweiler. This club was formed in 1910 and continues to provide sports training and character-building in young people. ASV Winnweiler fields teams at most levels of official German football from grade school to adult men and women's teams. The sports field consists of one lighted turf pitch, one lighted smaller cage (for warm-up or training similar to futsal or indoor football), and one grass pitch. The clubhouse is a full-service clubhouse with food, drinks, indoor and outdoor seating, and restrooms - along with several locker rooms for the players.

A Systems Analysis of Political Life, New York, S.32. Systems theory in political science is a highly abstract, partly holistic view of politics, influenced by cybernetics. The adaptation of system theory to political science was first conceived by David Easton in 1953. Overview In simple terms, Easton's behavioral approach to politics, proposed that a political system could be seen as a delimited (i.e. all political systems have precise boundaries) and fluid (changing) system of steps in decision making. Greatly simplifying his model:Easton, David. (1965). A Systems Analysis of Political Life. New York: Wiley. Influence of computers on the discipline of political science and the political system work within an environment. The environment generates different demands from different section of society such as reservation system in the matter of a certain group, demand for better transportation etc. * Step 1. changes in the social or physical environment surrounding a political system produce \\"demands\\" and \\"supports\\" for action or the status quo directed as \\"inputs\\" towards the political system, through political behavior. * Step 2, these demands and supporting groups stimulate competition in a political system, leading to decisions or \\"outputs\\" directed at some aspect of the surrounding social or physical environment. * Step 3, after a decision or output is made (e.g., a specific policy), it interacts with its environment, and if it produces change in the environment, there are \\"outcomes.\\" * Step 4, when a new policy interacts with its environment, outcomes may generate new demands or supports and groups in support or against the policy (\\"feedback\\") or a new policy on some related matter. * Step 5, feedback, leads back to Step 1, forming a never-ending cycle. If the system functions as described, then we have a \\"stable political system\\". If the system breaks down, then we have a \\"dysfunctional political system\\". Political analysis Easton aspired to make politics a science, that is, working with highly abstract models that described the regularities of patterns and processes in political life in general. In his view, the highest level of abstraction could make scientific generalizations about politics possible. In sum, politics should be seen as a whole, not as a collection of different problems to be solved.Easton, David. (1953). The Political System: An Inquiry into the State of Political Science. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. His main model was driven by an organic view of politics, as if it were a living object. His theory is a statement of what makes political systems adapt and survive. He describes politics in a constant flux, thereby rejecting the idea of \\"equilibrium\\", so prevalent in some other political theories (see institutionalism). Moreover, he rejects the idea that politics could be examined by looking at different levels of analysis. His abstractions could account for any group and demand at any given time. That is, interest group theory and elite theory can be subsumed in political systems analysis.Easton, David. (1965). A Framework for Political Analysis. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. His theory was and is highly influential in the pluralist tradition in political science. (see Harold Lasswell and Robert Dahl) Critiques Easton's approach has been criticised for being unfalsifiable and holding a Western or American bias, as well as not explaining crises or the breakdown of the system.

Prehistory The vase from Butmir near Sarajevo, early Neolithic The Paleolithic in Bosnia is marked by the oldest Paleolithic monument in southeastern Europe, the engravings in Badanj Cave near Stolac in Herzegovina. A magnificent one is Horse attacked by arrows, preserved in fragments and dated around 14-12000 BC. During the time when Neolithic cultures were appearing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there existed interesting mixtures of Mediterranean and Pannonian cultures. Herzegovina was under the influence of impresso ceramics from the western Mediterranean, as seen in Green Cave near Mostar, Čairi near Stolac, Lisičići near Konjic and Peć Mlini near Grude. People then lived in caves or simple settlements on hilltops. On the upper mainstream of the Bosna river and in northeast parts of Bosnia (Obre I near Kakanj), people lived in wooden houses built by the river. In this culture we can see influences from Adriatic cultures in the south and the Starčević culture in the northeast. Original expressions of Kakanj culture are ceramic pots on four legs, called rhyton. We can also find them in the Danilo culture on the Croatian coast. Due to these objects, Kakanj culture is considered a part of the wide circle of Neolithic populations that followed a cult of life force (from northern Italy, Dalmatia and Epirus to the Aegean). The Butmir culture near Sarajevo is distinctive, with fine glazed ceramics and miscellaneous geometrical decorations (often spirals). Figures from Butmir are unique sculptures modeled with hand; heads are almost like portraits with emphasized parts of body. Bronze Age settlements in Herzegovina were built like citadels (natively called gradina), and in Bosnia we have necropolises with stone tumuli. During this time, bronze arms, decorated plates, flat necklaces, and fibulas were decorated with a specific geometrical style of engraved ornament. Illyrian period Iron Age Glasinac culture (around 300 BC). The bronze culture of the Illyrians, an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania and parts of northern Greece. From 8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in Illyria (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was that of the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC.[7] The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom.[8] The Kingdom of the Ardiaei (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC.[9] The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom.[10] Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well. From the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of Halstat cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different. A very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of cremation and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth tumuli (natively called gromile) that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high. Japodian tribes had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil). Roman glass found in Bosanski Novi from the 2nd century In the 4th century BC, the first invasion of Celts is recorded. They brought the technique of the pottery wheel, new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to Greece, so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages. In the Neretva Delta in the south, there were important Hellenistic influence of the Illyrian Daors tribe. Their capital was Daorson in Ošanići near Stolac, the main center of ancient culture in B&H.; Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by megalithic, 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of Mycenae in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze coins and sculptures. Roman period Conflict between the Illyrians and ancient Romans started in 229 BC. In the year 168 BC, the land of Illyrians became the Roman province of Illyricum. Rome completed its annexation of the region in 9 A.D, ending a three-year rebellion of Illyrians against Romans. In the year 10 A.D., Illyria was divided and the northern strip of today's Bosnia along the south side of the Sava River became part of the new province of Pannonia. The rest of what is today Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Dalmatia, and western Serbia became part of the Roman province of Dalmatia. left In the Roman period, Latin- speaking settlers from all over the Roman Empire settled among the Illyrians and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region. Several towns of today's Bosnia were founded under Roman rule. For example, the town of Blagaj on the Buna River is built on the site of the Roman town of Bona. Roman Bosnia enjoyed a huge development, with many \\"Roman via\\" and \\"castra\\" and an economy based on the exploitation of mines.Map and information of Roman Bosnia- Herzegovina Following Roman rule there was a large number of Vlachs who were descended from a pre-Slavic population. Related to Romanians and originally speaking a language related to Romanian, the Vlachs are today Slavic speakingJohn V. A. Fine,John Van Antwerp Fine, The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century. University of Michigan Press, 1994 p.19 Christianity had already arrived in the region by the end of the 1st century, and numerous artifacts and objects from the time testify to this. Following events from the years 337 and 395, when the Roman Empire split, Dalmatia and Pannonia were included in the Western Roman Empire. The region was conquered by Huns, and later by the Ostrogoths in 455. The Ostrogoth Kingdom was defeated by Byzantine Empire in the Gothic War (535-553) by the Emperor Justinian I, and the area was re-conquered for the Byzantine Empire.

At its apex, The News was widely regarded as the newspaper of record in New Jersey.\\"Newark Evening News preservation\\". The Second Century. vol. 9, no. 3. Fall 1998. The Newark Public Library. It had bureaus in Montclair, Elizabeth, Metuchen, Morristown, Plainfield, Kearny, and Belmar. There were also bureaus in the New Jersey State House in Trenton and in Washington, DC.  History  The News was founded in 1883 by Wallace Scudder. The newspaper was operated by the Scudder family for 86 of its 88 years. The grandson of Wallace Scudder, Richard Scudder, worked as the newspaper's publisher from 1952 until 1972. For years, the paper thrived as a daily and Sunday paper. It had five editorial writers, an editorial cartoonist, a military writer, and an aviation writer. The paper even had a Sunday magazine. However, a great deal of the paper's focus was on politics. In 1970, the paper was sold to Media General. In February 1971, the newsroom, which had never been organized, voted to go out on strike and walked out in May 1971. The strike lasted almost a full year — not settling until April 1972. It faced increasing competition from the Newark Star-Ledger, and for its final four months, the daily editions of the Newark Evening News were printed on Star-Ledger presses. That was because the paper's new owners had sold the presses, along with the Sunday News edition, to the Star-Ledger. The paper folded on August 31, 1972.  Historic research  Since its demise, the Newark Public Library acquired the paper's records, including ancillary materials (reporters’ notes, etc.), and has undertaken a major preservation project.

It is the most famous zoological garden in Taiwan and a leader in conservation, research and education, and recreation. It is one of the largest zoos in Asia, with a total area of 165 hectares, of which more than 90 ha are developed. History Hippo sculptures at the Taipei Zoo The Taipei Zoo was founded as in 1914, when Taiwan was under Japanese rule, in Mt. Maruyama (modern-day Yuanshan) on the northern suburb of Taihoku (modern-day Taipei). It was originally a private zoological garden owned by a Japanese citizen, Mr. Oe. The Japanese government in Taiwan bought the property the following year and opened it as a public park. After World War II, the Republic of China (ROC) retreated to Taiwan and the ownership of the park was passed to the Taipei City Government of ROC. An Asian elephant named Lin Wang that served with the Chinese Expeditionary Force during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) and later relocated to Taiwan with the Kuomintang forces was moved to the zoo, and lived out most of his life and was the most popular animal at the zoo, and the most famous animal in Taiwan until it received 2 pandas from China. Many adults and children alike affectionately called the bull elephant \\"Grandpa Lin Wang\\". Due to a need for expansion and for better conditions for the animals, the zoo was moved to its current site in Muzha on the southeastern suburb of Taipei City in 1986. It is, therefore, sometimes referred to as the \\"Muzha Zoo\\" to be distinguished from the former \\"Yuan-shan Zoo\\". The current site encloses 165 hectares, including 90 hectares open to the public. The zoo was badly hit during Typhoon Soudelor on 8 August 2015 which caused NT$10 million of loss with additional NT$4 million in reparation cost. The zoo opened again on 11 August 2015 while some parts of it were still kept closed.http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/chiayi/2015/08/11/442964/Alishan- Railway.htm  Exhibitions  The Taipei Zoo displays animals from Taiwan, Australia, Africa, the Asian tropical rainforest, the desert, and the temperate zones. The zoo also displays domestic animals in its Children's Zoo, as well as over 12000 birds of over 130 species in an aviary. Other exhibitions in the zoo include an insectarium, amphibian and reptile house, penguin habitat, koala habitat, nocturnal animals display, and a panda exhibition.  Giant Panda House  Tuan Tuan at the Taipei Zoo In 2008, the zoo received two pandas from the People's Republic of China (PRC), named Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan (meaning \\"reunion\\"), as a gesture of unity. The gift of the endangered pandas had been rejected by President Chen Shui-bian in 2005 who viewed it as a propaganda tool against Taiwan's independence, but the next president, Ma Ying-jeou, of the Kuomintang, had forged stronger economic and diplomatic relations with the PRC under his presidency, and was willing to accept them. The offering of pandas as a gift from the PRC is often known as \\"panda diplomacy\\", and the zoo expected to draw around 30,000 visitors a day as a result of their arrival. The move was criticized by supporters of Taiwan's independence and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, who said that \\"Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan means a union, which perfectly matches Beijing's goal of bringing Taiwan into its fold.\\" The offspring of Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, Yuan Zai, was born on July 6, 2013. She is the first panda cub to be born in Taiwan. Yuan Zai's public debut was on January 6, 2014. Pangolin dome The Pangolin dome is a pavilion which was completed in 2019 at a cost of NT$390 million. Its design was inspired by the shape of a pangolin and is intended to raise public awareness about wildlife trafficking in general and more specifically the pangolin trade. The pavilion sits on 1.5 hectares, is 24 meters tall, and comprises six outdoor exhibits and one indoor. The large dome shaped indoor exhibit is used to display tropical rainforest species.

Another theory is that Lagos was named after the city of the same name in Portugal which at the time was a major maritime hub for seafaring activity on the Atlantic Ocean. Although Lagos translates to \\"lakes\\" in Portuguese, it also means “Lagoon”, or a salt water body of water connected to the ocean by channels which flow depending on the tide. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, for instance, the Portuguese named the “Região dos Lagos” (Lakes Region) an area with lagoons very much similar to the Lagos Lagoon. Lagos as a tributary to the Benin Empire From the crowning of Ado as its first Oba, Lagos (then called Eko) served as a major center for slave-trade, from which then Oba of Benin Ado and all of his successors for over four centuries supported - until 1841, when Oba Akitoye ascended to the throne of Lagos and attempted to ban slave-trading. Local merchants strongly opposed the intended move, and deposed and exiled the king, and installed Akitoye's brother Kosoko as Oba.http://www.hubert- herald.nl/NigeriaL.htm At exile in Europe, Akitoye met with British authorities, who had banned slave-trading in 1807, and who therefore decided to support the deposed Oba to regain his throne. With the success of the British intervention, in 1851 Akitoye was reinstalled as Oba of Lagos. In practical terms, however, British influence over the kingdom had become absolute, and ten years later, in 1861, Lagos was formally annexed as a British colony. Colonial Lagos as capital of Nigeria The British annexed Lagos as a colony in 1861. The remainder of the Benin Empire - i.e., modern- day Nigeria - were seized by the British in 1887, and when the British established the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914, Lagos was declared its capital. Lagos maintained its status as capital when Nigeria obtained its independence from Britain in 1960. Lagos was therefore the capital city of Nigeria from 1914 until 1991, when it was replaced as Federal Capital Territory by planned city of Abuja, built specifically for such purpose. Currently Until today, the Oba of Lagos is the head of all the Kings in Lagos State and his status is different from other Obas most of whom were later given back their crowns and staff of office only within the last 40 years except for the Alahun of Imoore Oba Haruna Okikiola who went to late justice Savage enquiry to proof that the Oba of Imoore is a first class Oba that had his crown from ile-ife that should not be classified amongst Obas that only got their crowns recently. Those who got their crowns back were the original land owners (Olofin's children). The present day Lagos state has a higher percent of this sub-group who allegedly migrated to the area from Isheri along the Ogun river. History has it that the Awori were actually from Ife, the cradle of Yorubaland. The Awori people are a peaceful people initially not taken to warfare. Due to war, those from the hinterlands, like the Ekiti, ran towards Isheri, which at that time had more than one Olofin who were heads of settlements about 1400AD. When the people fled from the hinterlands most of them scattered again, some to Iro, to Otta, Ado, others to Ebute Metta i.e. three landing places - Oyingbo, Iddo Island and Lagos Island (Eko). The Olofin that brought those who went to Ebute-Metta was Ogunfunminire, later known as Agbodere. With the full commencement of the war about 2000 moved to Iddo Island, others to Otto Awori or Otto Ijanikin towards modern-day Badagry. Those from Ekiti Aramoko came to Ebute-Metta, Iddo and then Ijora. After the demise of Agbodere, the name Olofin became the name used to remember him; the title of Oloto was given to his successor. When one of his sons becoming the Oloto his other children parted ways to what is known as visible settlements in present-day Lagos. Until the coming of the Benins, Lagos's geographic boundary was Lagos Mainland. Lagos Island, the seat of the Oba of Lagos, then consisted of a pepper farm which belonged to the Aromire family (One of Olofin's sons) and fishing posts. No one lived there. The name Eko was given to it by its first king, Oba Ado, during its early history; it also saw periods of rule by the Kingdom of Benin. Eko was the land area now known as Lagos Island where the king's palace was built. The palace is called Iga Idunganran, meaning palace built on the pepper farm. Oba Ado and the warriors from Benin, as well as some of the indigenous people who sought safety, settled in the southern part of Eko, called Isale Eko. \\"Isale\\" literally means \\"bottom\\", but must have been used to indicate downtown (as in Downtown Lagos). Notable events The first king of Lagos, Oba Ado, apart from having two sons also had a daughter Erelu Kuti, who begat Ologun Kutere, who later became king. Shokun his brother, who was more aggressive and whom the Erelu suspected could plan a palace coup, was given a chieftaincy title, \\"Onile-gbale\\", and a palace just behind the king's palace. This was the first time that a Chief would be appointed and installed at the same time as a King's coronation.

Prior to this, all the Kings of lagos were buried in Benin. They passed on taxes to the Oba of Benin until the British came and explained that there was no need to send taxes to Benin anymore since they were no longer under Benin suzerainty. It was during his reign that the direct influence of Benin on Lagos ended. Oba Kosoko believed in the slave trade and was at loggerheads with the British, hence his dethronement and flight, first to Badagry and later to Epe, Nigeria where he founded kingdoms that still exist today.

It was later called Eko. The Portuguese explorer Ruy de Sequeira who visited the area in 1472, named the area around the city Lago de Curamo; the present name is Portuguese for \\"lakes\\". An alternate explanation is that Lagos was named for Lagos, Portugal - a maritime town which at the time was the main center of the Portuguese expeditions down the African coast and whose own name is derived from the Celtic word Lacobriga. Flag of Lagos Colony It was a major centre of the slave trade until 1851, and the Bombardment of Lagos. Britain, which had banned slavery in 1807, signed a treaty which ushered in the British consular period. Lagos was annexed by Britain via the Lagos Treaty of Cession in 1861 ending the consular period and starting the British colonial period. The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1886. Post colonial Lagos street, ca. 1910 When the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914 Lagos was declared its capital. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom prior to the Biafran War. This continued through the 1980s and 1990s up to the present date. Lagos was the capital of Nigeria from 1914 - 1991 when the capital was moved to Abuja. Abuja is a capital like Washington, DC in United States and Brasilia in Brazil in that it was built from scratch specifically to be a capital. In 1991, Ibrahim Babangida, the Military President and other government functions moved to the newly built capital. This was as a result of intelligence reports on the safety of his life and what was later to be termed his hidden agenda, which was the plan to turn himself into a civilian president. He finished what was started by the Murtala/Obasanjo regime. The change resulted in Lagos losing some prestige and economic leverage. However, it has retained its importance as the country's largest city and as an economic centre. In 2002, accidental explosions killed more than 1,000 people. In 2012, 163 people died when a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 crashed into a local furniture works and printing press building.

There are different stories of two saints with by the name Renatus, who were later merged into a single one based on their described similarities and contemporaneity. Both are venerated in Italy and France. They were: Saint Renatus of Sorrento (San Renato di Sorrento), and Saint Renatus of Angers (Saint-René d'Angers). Part of their stories seem to be a legend, part incomplete and part deficient historically documented. Due to the Angevin domination of Naples from the 13th to the 15th century, and the fact that they were both bishops and saints from the same age, the personality of Renatus of Sorrento was linked with the figure of Renatus of Angers. Maurilius of Angers and saint Renatus of Angers Saint Renatus of Angers (Saint-René d'Angers) The first story of the lesser known Saint-René began when the Italian Saint Maurilius, the bishop of the French city of Angers (Anjou) in the 5th century, was one day called to assist a moribund child. Unfortunately he was detained by a pressing task in the church, and arrived too late to minister the sacrament of baptism to the child. Feeling responsible for the loss, Maurice decided to expiate it, and left Angers in secret and embarked upon a ship, throwing the keys to the cathedral's treasury into the high seas. He then went further to England, to work as the royal gardener. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Angers had found the keys inside the liver of a big fish which was caught by the local fishermen. They traced the whereabouts of the bishop to England and convinced him to return to their city. Arriving at Angers, Maurilius prayed at the dead child's tomb, and, in a miracle, the child resuscitated, smiling, \\"fresh as the flowers growing on the tomb\\". Because of this Maurilius baptized the boy as René (French for re-born and Renatus). René later succeeded Maurilius as the bishop of Angers, and came to sainthood himself, as Saint René. Saint-René is mostly venerated in France on November 12. Saint Renatus of Sorrento (San Renato di Sorrento) The second story of the better known San Renato is about a bishop in the 5th century who lived in the city of Sorrento, near Naples, in the province of Campania; therefore he was a member of the early Christian church. He was the first bishop of Sorrento, and probably was one of the hermits who lived in the hills near the city. According to Antonio Borrelli, he may have been an early member of the hermits, such as Catellus of Castellammare or Antoninus of Sorrento, who lived between the 7th and 9th centuries as hermits on the hills of the Sorrentine Peninsula. A homily dedicated to the saint, composed at the end of the eighth century, does not refer to him as a bishop, nor is he mentioned as such in the Life of Saint Antoninus, Abbot of Sorrento, composed in the 9th century or sometime after. The Life includes a description of the saints obtained from painting hanging at the time in the cathedral of Sorrento. In this work, Renatus is depicted as an old man and appears with the patron saints of Sorrento: Antoninus of Sorrento, Athanasius of Sorrento, Baculus of Sorrento, and Valerius of Sorrento. In the narrative, the saints appear to Duke Sergius I of Naples on the eve of battle against Moorish forces in 846 AD. Renatus' place of prayer (oratorio) became the city's first cathedral, which later was substituted in 1603 by a big basilica built by the Benedictines of Monte Cassino, during a time of renewed interest in the relics associated with Renatus and Valerius of Sorrento. Renatus’ cult was diffused throughout Campania. In Sorrento there was a chapel in the cathedral dedicated to the saint, where he is venerated with the title of Confessor of the Faith. On Monte Faito, in the Municipality of Vico Equense, there was a small church dedicated to Renatus. Several centers for Renatus’ cult appeared in Naples, and are mentioned in documents dating from July 1276 and March 1367. There were also centers of his cult in Capua, Sarno, and Nola in the fourteenth century. The present-day Duomo of Sorrento has a chapel dedicated to San Renato. He was also venerated on October 6. Fusion The story goes on when in 1262, Charles I d'Anjou, a prince of the House of Anjou, now a powerful dynasty, conquered Naples. The French conquerors soon discovered the local saint of devotion, Saint Renatus of Sorrento. The Sorrentini became acquainted with the story of Saint Renatus of Angers. Since they seemed to be contemporaries, and were physically described by their contemporaries as being very similar (a bald old man, with a long beard) one single figure of devotion was born by common consent, and the legend was amplified by telling how the Bishop of Angers came to Sorrento in old age, and went to live as a hermit, and became the new Bishop of Sorrento. Thus, Renatus of Angers and Renatus of Sorrento were identified as being the same person. Although plausible, no historical and documental proof of this identity ever came to light, however. Veneration Saint Renatus of Angers, by confusion of his name with reins, \\"kidneys\\" (once believed to be the seat of sexual power) was invoked for fertility as one of the phallic saints.The Minor Themes Trivia About a millennium after the saints lived, René of Anjou, named after Saint-René and born in the castle of Angers became King René I of Naples (near Sorrento). He was known as the Good King René (French Le bon roi René).  References  Sources * San Renato di Angers. Santi e Beati. * San Renato di Sorrento. Santi e Beati.

It is the follow-up to AIP's box office hit I Was a Teenage Werewolf, released less than five months earlier. Both films later received a sequel in the fictional crossover How to Make a Monster, released in July 1958. The film stars Whit Bissell, Phyllis Coates, Robert Burton, Gary Conway and George Lynn. Plot Professor Frankenstein (Whit Bissell), a guest lecturer from England, talks Dr. Karlton (Robert Burton) into becoming an unwilling accomplice in his secret plan to actually assemble a human being from the parts of different cadavers. After recovering a body from a catastrophic automobile wreck, Professor Frankenstein takes the body to his laboratory/morgue, where in various drawers he keeps spare parts of human beings. The professor also enlists the aid of Margaret (Phyllis Coates), as his secretary, to keep all callers away from the laboratory. Margaret, becoming suspicious of what is going on, decides to investigate and goes down to the morgue. She is panic-stricken by the monster (Gary Conway), who has been activated following the grafting of a new leg and arm. She dares not tell the professor about her feelings and keeps silent for the present. On a couple of occasions, the professor takes discarded human body parts ... and feeds them to an alligator concealed in a hidden chamber. One night, the monster leaves the laboratory. He peers into a girl's apartment. The girl becomes hysterical and starts screaming; in his attempt to silence her, he kills her in panic and flees. The next morning, the hunt for the murderer is on. Margaret, angry at the professor, tells him that she knows that the monster is responsible for the murder. The professor, taking no chances, has the monster kill her and feeds her remains to the alligator. Dr. Karlton, sent out of town, knows nothing about this. The professor accompanies the monster to a lover's lane, where he kills a teenage boy in order to obtain his face. The boy's face is successfully grafted onto the monster. Professor Frankenstein tells Dr. Karlton of his plans to dismember his creation and ship him in various boxes to England and then return there to put him together again. When they strap the monster down again, he becomes suspicious and tears loose—to throw Professor Frankenstein into the alligator pit—while Dr. Karlton runs for help. When Dr. Karlton arrives with the police, the monster, maddened with fright, backs into the electrical dial board. Contact with the iron wrist bands electrocutes him and he falls to the ground, dead. Karlton tells the police that he will never forget the way the monster's face looked after the accident.

He published a major study in 1854, Polyglotta Africana, marking the beginning of serious study by Europeans of African languages. Life Sigismund Koelle was born in Cleebronn in the Württemberg region of southern Germany. In his Württemberg origin he resembles his contemporaries Johann Ludwig Krapf (born 1810) and Johannes Rebmann (born 1820), who also worked as linguists and missionaries for the Church Missionary Society, but in East Africa.Johnston (1918), p. 98. Another CMS missionary born in Württemberg was Karl Gottlieb Pfander (born 1803), who was Koelle's colleague in Istanbul. After training in the Basel Mission, a missionary seminary in Basel, Switzerland, Koelle transferred in 1845 to the Church Missionary Society based in London; after further training in Islington he was ordained by the Bishop of London, Charles Blomfield.Stock (1899), vol. 2, p. 102. From December 1847 to February 1853Curtin & Vansina (1964), p. 186. he lived and worked in Sierra Leone, the British protectorate established in West Africa for liberated slaves. Koelle taught at Fourah Bay College, which was founded by the Church Missionary Society in 1827.Houis (1966), p. 137; Solleveld (2020), §1. \\"He was a Semitic scholar, and started a Hebrew class at Fourah Bay; and very soon African youths, the children of liberated slaves, could be seen reading the Old Testament in the original.\\"Stock (1899), vol. 2, p. 102. While in Sierra Leone he also collected linguistic material from many African languages, some of it from freed slaves such as Ali Eisami, a Kanuri man. Koelle's major work, Polyglotta Africana (1854), is considered the beginning of the serious study of a large range of African languages by European scholars. Grammar of the Vai language In 1849, when Koelle had been in Freetown for just over a year, he was asked to investigate a report that speakers of the Vy, Vei, or Vai language were using a script of their own invention. Koelle made a 7-week trip to Vailand to meet the inventor of the script, and wrote an account of his journey which was published later that same year.Koelle (1849). In mid 1850, Koelle spent a few weeks in the Gallinas district of Vailand, and from November 1850 to March 1851 he worked again in the Cape Mount district.P. E. H. Hair, introduction to the 1968 reprint of Koelle's Grammar. By July 1851 he had completed his Vai grammar, and it was published by the Church Missionary Society in 1854. Polyglotta Africana The second great linguistic work carried out by Koelle during his five years in Sierra Leone was the Polyglotta Africana.Houis (1966), p. 137, states that it was researched between April 1850 and July 1852. Curtin & Vansina (1964), p. 186, state that the book was mostly researched in 1849. The idea of this was to use the fact that Sierra Leone was a melting pot of ex-slaves from all over Africa to compile a list of 280 basic words (a sort of early Swadesh list) in some 160 languages and dialects. These were then grouped as far as possible in families. Most of the informants who contributed to this work came from West Africa, but there were also others from as far away as Mozambique. One area that was lacking was the Swahili coast of Kenya and Tanzania, since it seems that slaves from this region were generally taken northwards to Zanzibar and Arabia rather than southward towards America and Brazil.Curtin & Vansina (1964), p. 189. The pronunciations of all the words were carefully noted using an alphabet similar, though not identical, to that devised by Karl Richard Lepsius, which was not yet available at that time.Solleveld (2020), section 2. The name of the book was imitated from a well-known work called Asia Polyglotta (1823) by the German scholar Julius Klaproth.Solleveld (2020), section 1. In the introduction Koelle tells us that he wanted a selection of words that would be simple enough for each informant to be interviewed on a single day, and for this reason he omitted pronouns, which would have taken much longer to elicit. He adds that a few years earlierA footnote in Lapsansky-Werner & Bacon (2005), p. 255, states that Koelle had already made a brief visit to Sierra Leone in 1843 under the auspices of the Church Missionary Society. during a long vacation he had made a similar such list, of just 71 languages, and that in making the present list he had learnt from that experience. Included with a book is a map of Africa showing the approximate location, as far as it could be ascertained, of each language, prepared by the cartographer August Heinrich Petermann. The value of the list is not merely linguistic, since the work not only includes the words themselves, arranged with all the languages spread out on two facing pages for each group of three English words, but Koelle also added a short biography of each informant, with geographical information about their place of origin, and an indication of how many other people they knew in Sierra Leone who spoke the same language. This information, combined with a census of Sierra Leone conducted in 1848, has proved invaluable to historians researching the African slave trade in the 19th century.Curtin & Vansina (1964), p. 186. Of the 210 informants, there were 179 ex-slaves (two of them women), while the rest were mostly traders or sailors.Hair (1965), p. 193. An analysis of the data shows that typically Koelle's informants were middle-aged or elderly men who had been living in Freetown for ten years or more. Three-quarters of the ex-slaves had left their homeland more than ten years earlier, and half of them more than 20 years before; and three-quarters of the informants were over 40 years old.Hair (1965), p. 195. Another interesting facet of the book is the manner in which the informants had been made slaves. Some had been captured in war, some kidnapped, some sold by a relative, others condemned for a debt or sentenced for a crime.Hair (1965), pp. 196–200. Grammar of the Kanuri language Another work researched and written by Koelle in Sierra Leone was the Grammar of the Bornu or Kanuri Language, also published in 1854. Koelle was engaged on this at intervals from 1848 to 1853, working for several hours a day with an informant called Ali Eisami Gazirma (also known as William Harding). Eisami also provided the material for another work, African Native Literature, which consists of proverbs, fables, descriptive accounts, and historical fragments in the Kanuri language.Anderson & Lovejoy (2020), ch. 6, p. 135. Of Koelle's grammar, a later researcher, A. Von Duisburg, wrote:Grundriss der Kanuri- Sprache in Bornu (1913), translated by P. A. Benton Primer of Kanuri Grammar (1917), p. 8. :\\"Koelle's Grammar is compiled with very great industry, but it unfortunately contains numerous errors, which may be explained by the fact that Koelle was never in Bornu or any racially allied country. His chief informant was an interpreter resident in Sierra Leone, who had left his mother-country more than forty years before Koelle made use of him in his linguistic studies. An examination of the above-mentioned Grammar warrants the assumption that Koelle himself never spoke Kanuri. He himself admits in the Preface to his Grammar that his interpreter did not seem to be reliable as regards the pronunciation of consonants, a fact which is frequently noticeable in the Grammar.\\" However, the translator P. A. Benton adds in a footnote: \\"I cannot agree. Koelle seems to me to be extraordinarily accurate.\\"For another assessment of the work, see Henry B. Lovejoy in Anderson & Lovejoy (2020), ch. 6, pp. 139–40. Later career After 1853, Koelle, who had become ill by the end of his stay in Sierra Leone,Stock (1899), vol 2. p. 148. never returned to West Africa. For a time he continued his linguistic researches, in particular on questions of standard orthography, in connection with the Standard Alphabet which was being discussed in 1854 by Karl Lepsius.Solleveld (2020), section 2. In 1855 he was sent to Egypt, but remained only a short time; he moved on to Haifa in Palestine in the same year. In 1856 he was awarded the Volney Prize of 1,200 francs by the French Academy of Sciences for his work on the Polyglotta Africana.Houis (1966), p. 138. In 1859 he was posted by the Church Missionary Society to Constantinople (Istanbul) to join Karl Gottlieb Pfander, who had gone out the year before. Together with another missionary, R. H. Weakley, they had some success in converting Turks to Christianity. However, in 1864, there was a violent reaction from the Turkish government and several Turkish converts were arrested. Pfander and Weakley were forced to leave Constantinople, while Koelle remained behind for a few more years.Vander Werff, (1977), p. 163. When the Church Missionary Society withdrew from the city in 1877, he stayed on there for a time as an independent missionary, until in 1879 he too was forced to depart, after being arrested, together with a Turkish friend, Ahmed Tewfik, who had helped him translate the Anglican prayer book into Turkish. Koelle was released after a few hours, but Tewfik was imprisoned and sentenced to death. After pressure from the British Government, Tewfik was sent into exile on the island of Chios, and eventually escaped to England, where he was baptized in 1881 into the Anglican church in a ceremony in St Paul's, Onslow Square London, witnessed among others by Koelle's father-in-law, Archdeacon Philpot. However, it seems that he was unhappy with his new life and after being sent to Egypt in 1883 he eventually voluntarily gave himself up again to his captors in Chios.Stock (1899), vol 3, p. 123. Sigismund Koelle died in London in 1902.Deutsche Biographie.

The lake covers a total of 37 square kilometres, in contrast to its size its depth is very shallow. It was once the natural harbour of Tunis. History The Tunis-Carthage connection was very important to the Romans, as it meant control over the fertile hinterland. The Romans therefore built a dam through the lake. The dam is used today as an expressway for automobiles and railway connecting Tunis to the harbour, La Goulette, and the coastal cities of Carthage, Sidi Bou Said, and La Marsa. The northern lake includes the island of Chikly, once home to a Spanish stronghold, and now (since 1993) a nature reserve. The lake continued to aggrade (an increase in land elevation, in this case of the lake bed, due to the deposition of sediment) during the 19th century. French colonial forces traversed the lake with a 10-kilometer long, 450-meter wide, and 6-meter deep canal. Development Recently, the Tunisian government and Sama Dubai of the UAE (led by Dubai Governor Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) have joint-ventured an investment agreement to develop the southern shore of the lake into a new commercial, residential and touristic center in Tunisia and the Mediterranean. Total costs of the investment, considered the biggest in Tunisia's history, will be around US$18 billion. The project should be ready in the next 10 to 15 years.

The school is part of the Cape Henlopen School District and is located between Savannah Road and King's Highway. Cape Henlopen's school colors are bright gold and Columbia blue. Its mascot is Thor the Viking. In the 2016-17 school year, there were 1,406 students enrolled at the high school. The Cape Henlopen School District Superintendent is Mr. Robert Fulton. Other members of the Cape Henlopen Board of Education are Alison J. Myers, Jessica Tyndall, Andy Lewis, Janis Hanwell, Jason Bradley, Julie Derrick, and Roni Posner. History The original Cape Henlopen High School opened in 1969. It was a combination of three area schools that housed their high school grade levels with other grades: Rehoboth School, Lewes School, and Milton School. The district began construction of a new building to house Cape Henlopen High School in 1974. In September 1976, the new Cape Henlopen High School opened on Kings Hwy. The school was a model of 1970s architecture and echoed the educational sentiment of the day that called for minimal distraction in a classroom. The school's very few windows were positioned in places where it would be difficult for students to gaze out of them during classroom time. It was possible for a student to enter the building at the beginning of the school day and not see the sunshine again until he or she left at the end of the school day. Over time the sentiments of educators changed, and, because the school was showing its age, when construction began on the new school (located on the same property of the current school) in 2007, the decision was made to make it as bright a place as possible. Construction of the new school was completed in the fall of 2009. The new Cape Henlopen High School incorporates energy efficient materials and state-of-the-art technology. It also incorporates a separate 9th grade academy and vocational wing, eliminating the use of the Ninth Grade Campus building. Curriculum highlights While Cape Henlopen High School offers a variety of career pathways, the school is developing academies in areas which include the following: * Health care and human services including the Certified Nursing Assistant Academy * Leadership and JROTC * FFA, animal, plant and environmental sciences * Theater and performing arts * Business, finance and technology * Hospitality and tourism * World languages Staff development includes Learning Focused Strategy training and summer workshop initiatives which concentrate on curriculum alignment in core subject areas. Programs Cape Henlopen High School enjoys an athletic program to support student academic goals and interests. Athletics Cape Henlopen High School participates in athletics in the Henlopen Conference and is one of the larger high schools based on enrollment, thereby competing in the Henlopen North. Their 37 state championships rank them #1 in the Henlopen Conference for total state championships. The Lady Vikings' win of the 2009 Lacrosse title made them the first public high school in the state to win the championship that had been held since 1998. They also have a defending conference championship girls' cross country team that is looking to defend the title. Beside them is the boys' cross country team, coached by George Pepper. In May 2010 Cape's Lady Vikings Lacrosse team was titled State Champions for the second year in a row. As of 2015, Cape's girls' field hockey team has won five consecutive state championships, making them the first high school in the state to do so. On May 23, 2013, Cape's girls' lacrosse team won its fifth straight state championship, defeating Tower Hill 12-10 at Dover High School. Cape became the first public school to win a girls' lacrosse title and is one of only three schools in the state to ever win the championship. The win extended Cape's winning streak against Delaware opponents to 63 games. Extracurricular activities Cape Henlopen High School has an Army JROTC program, under the leadership of Senior Army Instructor LTC Ron Erale, and Army Instructors 1SG Phillip Webb and SFC Hurt. Cape Henlopen competes in competitions all over the area with its Raider, Rifle, and Drill teams and its Color Guard. Its Raider Team is one of the best in the region, acting as the vanguard for the entire program. The school bands take active part in the community. The concert and marching band has over 100 members every year, and they perform in numerous local parades, as well in competitions in places like London, Boston, Toronto, Miami, and Cleveland. The jazz band also participates in many local events, performing for Veterans Day and Memorial Day services, for local retirement homes, country clubs and the Rehoboth Beach Bandstand. The band was started in the 1970s by Barry Eli, and since then, the group has been awarded numerous trophies and has taken many \\"superior\\" titles. Eli retired from Cape in 2008.

Soil contamination or soil pollution as part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotics (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene), solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. Contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks, from direct contact with the contaminated soil, vapours from the contaminants, or from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil.Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund, Human Health Evaluation Manual, Office of Emergency and Remedial Response, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington D.C. 20450 Mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting cleanups are time- consuming and expensive tasks, requiring extensive amounts of geology, hydrology, chemistry, computer modeling skills, and GIS in Environmental Contamination, as well as an appreciation of the history of industrial chemistry. In North America and Western Europe the extent of contaminated land is best known, with many of countries in these areas having a legal framework to identify and deal with this environmental problem. Developing countries tend to be less tightly regulated despite some of them having undergone significant industrialization.  Causes  Soil pollution can be caused by the following (non-exhaustive list) * Microplastics * Oil spills * Mining and activities by other heavy industries * Accidental spills may happen during activities, etc. * Corrosion of underground storage tanks (including piping used to transmit the contents) * Acid rain * Intensive farming * Agrochemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers * Petrochemicals * Industrial accidents * Road debris * Drainage of contaminated surface water into the soil * Ammunitions, chemical agents, and other agents of war * Waste disposal ** Oil and fuel dumping ** Nuclear wastes ** Direct discharge of industrial wastes to the soil ** Discharge of sewage ** Landfill and illegal dumping ** Coal ash ** Electronic waste The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. Any activity that leads to other forms of soil degradation (erosion, compaction, etc.) may indirectly worsen the contamination effects in that soil remediation becomes more tedious. Historical deposition of coal ash used for residential, commercial, and industrial heating, as well as for industrial processes such as ore smelting, were a common source of contamination in areas that were industrialized before about 1960. Coal naturally concentrates lead and zinc during its formation, as well as other heavy metals to a lesser degree. When the coal is burned, most of these metals become concentrated in the ash (the principal exception being mercury). Coal ash and slag may contain sufficient lead to qualify as a \\"characteristic hazardous waste\\", defined in the US as containing more than 5 mg/l of extractable lead using the TCLP procedure. In addition to lead, coal ash typically contains variable but significant concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; e.g., benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, indeno(cd)pyrene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and others). These PAHs are known human carcinogens and the acceptable concentrations of them in soil are typically around 1 mg/kg. Coal ash and slag can be recognised by the presence of off-white grains in soil, gray heterogeneous soil, or (coal slag) bubbly, vesicular pebble-sized grains. Treated sewage sludge, known in the industry as biosolids, has become controversial as a \\"fertilizer\\". As it is the byproduct of sewage treatment, it generally contains more contaminants such as organisms, pesticides, and heavy metals than other soil.Free full-text (registration required) In the European Union, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive allows sewage sludge to be sprayed onto land. The volume is expected to double to 185,000 tons of dry solids in 2005. This has good agricultural properties due to the high nitrogen and phosphate content. In 1990/1991, 13% wet weight was sprayed onto 0.13% of the land; however, this is expected to rise 15 fold by 2005. Advocates say there is a need to control this so that pathogenic microorganisms do not get into water courses and to ensure that there is no accumulation of heavy metals in the top soil. Pesticides and herbicides A pesticide is a substance used to kill a pest. A pesticide may be a chemical substance, biological agent (such as a virus or bacteria), antimicrobial, disinfectant or device used against any pest. Pests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms) and microbes that compete with humans for food, destroy property, spread or are a vector for disease or cause a nuisance. Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, there are also drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other organisms. Herbicides are used to kill weeds, especially on pavements and railways. They are similar to auxins and most are biodegradable by soil bacteria. However, one group derived from trinitrotoluene (2:4 D and 2:4:5 T) have the impurity dioxin, which is very toxic and causes fatality even in low concentrations. Another herbicide is Paraquat. It is highly toxic but it rapidly degrades in soil due to the action of bacteria and does not kill soil fauna. Insecticides are used to rid farms of pests which damage crops. The insects damage not only standing crops but also stored ones and in the tropics it is reckoned that one third of the total production is lost during food storage. As with fungicides, the first insecticides used in the nineteenth century were inorganic e.g. Paris Green and other compounds of arsenic. Nicotine has also been used since the late eighteenth century. There are now two main groups of synthetic insecticides – 1\\\\. Organochlorines include DDT, Aldrin, Dieldrin and BHC. They are cheap to produce, potent and persistent. DDT was used on a massive scale from the 1930s, with a peak of 72,000 tonnes used 1970. Then usage fell as the harmful environmental effects were realized. It was found worldwide in fish and birds and was even discovered in the snow in the Antarctic. It is only slightly soluble in water but is very soluble in the bloodstream. It affects the nervous and endocrine systems and causes the eggshells of birds to lack calcium causing them to be easily breakable. It is thought to be responsible for the decline of the numbers of birds of prey like ospreys and peregrine falcons in the 1950s – they are now recovering. As well as increased concentration via the food chain, it is known to enter via permeable membranes, so fish get it through their gills. As it has low water solubility, it tends to stay at the water surface, so organisms that live there are most affected. DDT found in fish that formed part of the human food chain caused concern, but the levels found in the liver, kidney and brain tissues was less than 1 ppm and in fat was 10 ppm, which was below the level likely to cause harm. However, DDT was banned in the UK and the United States to stop the further buildup of it in the food chain. U.S. manufacturers continued to sell DDT to developing countries, who could not afford the expensive replacement chemicals and who did not have such stringent regulations governing the use of pesticides.. 2\\\\. Organophosphates, e.g. parathion, methyl parathion and about 40 other insecticides are available nationally. Parathion is highly toxic, methyl-parathion is less so and Malathion is generally considered safe as it has low toxicity and is rapidly broken down in the mammalian liver. This group works by preventing normal nerve transmission as cholinesterase is prevented from breaking down the transmitter substance acetylcholine, resulting in uncontrolled muscle movements.  Agents of war  The disposal of munitions, and a lack of care in manufacture of munitions caused by the urgency of production, can contaminate soil for extended periods. There is little published evidence on this type of contamination largely because of restrictions placed by governments of many countries on the publication of material related to war effort. However, mustard gas stored during World War II has contaminated some sites for up to 50 years– Six Mustard gas sites uncovered – The Independent and the testing of Anthrax as a potential biological weapon contaminated the whole island of Gruinard. Britain's Anthrax Island – BBC Health effects Contaminated or polluted soil directly affects human health through direct contact with soil or via inhalation of soil contaminants which have vaporized; potentially greater threats are posed by the infiltration of soil contamination into groundwater aquifers used for human consumption, sometimes in areas apparently far removed from any apparent source of above ground contamination. This tends to result in the development of pollution-related diseases. Health consequences from exposure to soil contamination vary greatly depending on pollutant type, pathway of attack and vulnerability of the exposed population. Chronic exposure to chromium, lead and other metals, petroleum, solvents, and many pesticide and herbicide formulations can be carcinogenic, can cause congenital disorders, or can cause other chronic health conditions. Industrial or man-made concentrations of naturally occurring substances, such as nitrate and ammonia associated with livestock manure from agricultural operations, have also been identified as health hazards in soil and groundwater.yosemite.epa.gov Chronic exposure to benzene at sufficient concentrations is known to be associated with higher incidence of leukemia. Mercury and cyclodienes are known to induce higher incidences of kidney damage and some irreversible diseases. PCBs and cyclodienes are linked to liver toxicity. Organophosphates and carbonates can induce a chain of responses leading to neuromuscular blockage. Many chlorinated solvents induce liver changes, kidney changes and depression of the central nervous system. There is an entire spectrum of further health effects such as headache, nausea, fatigue, eye irritation and skin rash for the above cited and other chemicals. At sufficient dosages a large number of soil contaminants can cause death by exposure via direct contact, inhalation or ingestion of contaminants in groundwater contaminated through soil.Article on soil contamination in China The Scottish Government has commissioned the Institute of Occupational Medicine to undertake a review of methods to assess risk to human health from contaminated land. The overall aim of the project is to work up guidance that should be useful to Scottish Local Authorities in assessing whether sites represent a significant possibility of significant harm (SPOSH) to human health. It is envisaged that the output of the project will be a short document providing high level guidance on health risk assessment with reference to existing published guidance and methodologies that have been identified as being particularly relevant and helpful. The project will examine how policy guidelines have been developed for determining the acceptability of risks to human health and propose an approach for assessing what constitutes unacceptable risk in line with the criteria for SPOSH as defined in the legislation and the Scottish Statutory Guidance. Ecosystem effects Not unexpectedly, soil contaminants can have significant deleterious consequences for ecosystems.Michael Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw and Harry Seidman Computer modelng of pesticide transport in soil for five instrumented watersheds, prepared for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Southeast Water laboratory, Athens, Ga. by ESL Inc., Sunnyvale, California (1973) There are radical soil chemistry changes which can arise from the presence of many hazardous chemicals even at low concentration of the contaminant species. These changes can manifest in the alteration of metabolism of endemic microorganisms and arthropods resident in a given soil environment. The result can be virtual eradication of some of the primary food chain, which in turn could have major consequences for predator or consumer species. Even if the chemical effect on lower life forms is small, the lower pyramid levels of the food chain may ingest alien chemicals, which normally become more concentrated for each consuming rung of the food chain. Many of these effects are now well known, such as the concentration of persistent DDT materials for avian consumers, leading to weakening of egg shells, increased chick mortality and potential extinction of species. Effects occur to agricultural lands which have certain types of soil contamination. Contaminants typically alter plant metabolism, often causing a reduction in crop yields. This has a secondary effect upon soil conservation, since the languishing crops cannot shield the Earth's soil from erosion. Some of these chemical contaminants have long half-lives and in other cases derivative chemicals are formed from decay of primary soil contaminants. Cleanup options Cleanup or environmental remediation is analyzed by environmental scientists who utilize field measurement of soil chemicals and also apply computer models (GIS in Environmental Contamination) for analyzing transportS.K.

Cole, \\"A multidimensional finite element code for the analysis of coupled fluid, energy and solute transport\\", Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory PNL-2939, EPA contract 68-03-3116 (1982) and fate of soil chemicals. Various technologies have been developed for remediation of oil-contaminated soil and sediments There are several principal strategies for remediation: * Excavate soil and take it to a disposal site away from ready pathways for human or sensitive ecosystem contact. This technique also applies to dredging of bay muds containing toxins. * Aeration of soils at the contaminated site (with attendant risk of creating air pollution) * Thermal remediation by introduction of heat to raise subsurface temperatures sufficiently high to volatize chemical contaminants out of the soil for vapor extraction. Technologies include ISTD, electrical resistance heating (ERH), and ET-DSP. * Bioremediation, involving microbial digestion of certain organic chemicals. Techniques used in bioremediation include landfarming, biostimulation and bioaugmentating soil biota with commercially available microflora. * Extraction of groundwater or soil vapor with an active electromechanical system, with subsequent stripping of the contaminants from the extract. * Containment of the soil contaminants (such as by capping or paving over in place). * Phytoremediation, or using plants (such as willow) to extract heavy metals. * Mycoremediation, or using fungus to metabolize contaminants and accumulate heavy metals. * Remediation of oil contaminated sediments with self-collapsing air microbubbles.A. Agarwal, Y. Zhou, Y. Liu (2016) Remediation of oil contaminated sand with self-collapsing air microbubbles. Environmental Science and Pollution Research DOI: 10.1007/s11356-016-7601-5 *Surfactant leaching By country Various national standards for concentrations of particular contaminants include the United States EPA Region 9 Preliminary Remediation Goals (U.S. PRGs), the U.S. EPA Region 3 Risk Based Concentrations (U.S. EPA RBCs) and National Environment Protection Council of Australia Guideline on Investigation Levels in Soil and Groundwater. People's Republic of China The immense and sustained growth of the People's Republic of China since the 1970s has exacted a price from the land in increased soil pollution. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment believes it to be a threat to the environment, to food safety and to sustainable agriculture. According to a scientific sampling, 150 million mu (100,000 square kilometres) of China's cultivated land have been polluted, with contaminated water being used to irrigate a further 32.5 million mu (21,670 square kilometres) and another 2 million mu (1,300 square kilometres) covered or destroyed by solid waste. In total, the area accounts for one-tenth of China's cultivatable land, and is mostly in economically developed areas. An estimated 12 million tonnes of grain are contaminated by heavy metals every year, causing direct losses of 20 billion yuan ($2.57 billion USD).Facing up to \\"invisible pollution\\"  European Union  According to the received data from Member states, in the European Union the number of estimated potential contaminated sites is more than 2.5 million and the identified contaminated sites around 342 thousand. Municipal and industrial wastes contribute most to soil contamination (38%), followed by the industrial/commercial sector (34%). Mineral oil and heavy metals are the main contaminants contributing around 60% to soil contamination. In terms of budget, the management of contaminated sites is estimated to cost around 6 billion Euros (€) annually. United Kingdom Generic guidance commonly used in the United Kingdom are the Soil Guideline Values published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Environment Agency. These are screening values that demonstrate the minimal acceptable level of a substance. Above this there can be no assurances in terms of significant risk of harm to human health. These have been derived using the Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment Model (CLEA UK). Certain input parameters such as Health Criteria Values, age and land use are fed into CLEA UK to obtain a probabilistic output. Guidance by the Inter Departmental Committee for the Redevelopment of Contaminated Land (ICRCL) has been formally withdrawn by DEFRA, for use as a prescriptive document to determine the potential need for remediation or further assessment. The CLEA model published by DEFRA and the Environment Agency (EA) in March 2002 sets a framework for the appropriate assessment of risks to human health from contaminated land, as required by Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. As part of this framework, generic Soil Guideline Values (SGVs) have currently been derived for ten contaminants to be used as \\"intervention values\\". These values should not be considered as remedial targets but values above which further detailed assessment should be considered; see Dutch standards. Three sets of CLEA SGVs have been produced for three different land uses, namely * residential (with and without plant uptake) * allotments * commercial/industrial It is intended that the SGVs replace the former ICRCL values. The CLEA SGVs relate to assessing chronic (long term) risks to human health and do not apply to the protection of ground workers during construction, or other potential receptors such as groundwater, buildings, plants or other ecosystems. The CLEA SGVs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding, as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils. To date, the first ten of fifty-five contaminant SGVs have been published, for the following: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, inorganic mercury, nickel, selenium ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene. Draft SGVs for benzene, naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold. Toxicological data (Tox) has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzo[a]pyrene, benzene, dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs, naphthalene, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, tetrachloroethene, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethene and xylene. The SGVs for ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene are dependent on the soil organic matter (SOM) content (which can be calculated from the total organic carbon (TOC) content). As an initial screen the SGVs for 1% SOM are considered to be appropriate. Canada India In March 2009, the issue of Uranium poisoning in Punjab attracted press coverage. It was alleged to be caused by fly ash ponds of thermal power stations, which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the Faridkot and Bhatinda districts of Punjab. The news reports claimed the uranium levels were more than 60 times the maximum safe limit. In 2012, the Government of India confirmedUranium in Ground Water Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India (2012) that the ground water in Malwa belt of Punjab has uranium metal that is 50% above the trace limits set by the United Nations' World Health Organization (WHO). Scientific studies, based on over 1000 samples from various sampling points, could not trace the source to fly ash and any sources from thermal power plants or industry as originally alleged. The study also revealed that the uranium concentration in ground water of Malwa district is not 60 times the WHO limits, but only 50% above the WHO limit in 3 locations. This highest concentration found in samples was less than those found naturally in ground waters currently used for human purposes elsewhere, such as Finland.Atomic Energy Report – Malwa Punjab Uranium Q&A; Lok Sabha, Government of India (2012) Research is underway to identify natural or other sources for the uranium.

Born in India in 1913, the elder son of Sir Ivo Elliott, 2nd Baronet, he was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, Eastbourne College and University College, Oxford where he was an active member of the Oxford Ornithological Society. From 1937 until 1961 he worked as a colonial civil servant, in Tanganyika Territory, where he was District Commissioner in Moshi and was then transferred to the Ministry of Natural Resources in Dar es Salaam. He was promoted to Permanent Secretary in 1958 and remained in that position until retirement in 1961 shortly before Independence. While at the Ministry he made an important contribution to the development of National Parks, in particular the creation of the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Conservation Area. During his time in Tanganyika he was seconded to become the first Administrator of Tristan da Cunha (1950–53). In his spare time, he was an avid and serious birdwatcher in Tanganyika, collecting specimens, making systematic observations, and publishing articles in ornithological journals. He continued this interest on Tristan, making an important contribution to the ornithology of the islands. In the 1953 New Year Honours he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his service to the community on Tristan da Cunha. Upon retiring from the colonial civil service in 1961 he was appointed Commonwealth Liaison Officer for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), based in Switzerland. In 1962 he also took on the role of Acting Secretary General of the IUCN and became Secretary General in 1964. Then in 1966 he changed role to become Secretary of the IUCN's Ecology Commission until 1970, but continued to edit the IUCN's technical publications for several more years. He served on the committee of the British Ornithologists’ Union, being Honorary Secretary 1962–66, Vice-President 1970–73 and President 1975–79. He was a Trustee of the British Museum (Natural History) 1971–81 and Chairman of the British Section of the International Council for Bird Preservation 1980–81.

The catalogue is made up of records that describe geospatial data (e.g. KML), geospatial services (e.g. WMS), and related resources. CSW is one part (or \\"profile\\") of the OGC Catalogue Service, which defines common interfaces to discover, browse, and query metadata about data, services, and other potential resources. Version 2.0 of the specification was released in May 2004. The most recent release is 2.0.2, which was published in 2007. Wednesday, 3 May 2017 The records are in XML according to the standard. Typically the records include Dublin Core, ISO 19139 or FGDC metadata, encoded in UTF-8 characters. Each record must contain certain core fields including: Title, Format, Type (e.g. Dataset, DatasetCollection or Service), BoundingBox (a rectangle of interest, expressed in latitude and longitude), Coordinate Reference System, and Association (a link to another metadata record). Operations defined by the CSW standard include: * \`GetCapabilities\`: \\"allows CSW clients to retrieve service metadata from a server\\" * \`DescribeRecord\`: \\"allows a client to discover elements of the information model supported by the target catalogue service. The operation allows some or all of the information model to be described\\". * \`GetRecords\`: search for records, returning record IDs * \`GetRecordById\`: \\"retrieves the default representation of catalogue records using their identifier\\" * \`GetDomain\` (optional): \\"used to obtain runtime information about the range of values of a metadata record element or request parameter\\" * \`Harvest\` (optional): create/update metadata by asking the server to 'pull' metadata from somewhere * \`Transaction\` (optional): create/edit metadata by 'pushing' the metadata to the server Requests can encode the parameters in three different ways: * GET with URL parameters * POST with form-encoded payload * POST with XML payload Responses are in XML.

Every language in a language family that descends from the same language as the others is a sister to them. A commonly given example is the Romance languages, each one of which is a continuation of spoken Latin. Italian and French have about 89% lexical overlap, meaning the words share 89 percent of the same characteristics and root origins. Italian and French have a huge number of similar words. Similarly, Spanish and Portuguese have about 89% lexical overlap, so many words are shared or similar between those two languages (see also cognates). Spanish and Romanian's overlap is lower, at about 67%. Spanish and Portuguese have undergone Arabic influence and Romanian has undergone many different influences over the years, particularly from the Slavic languages and Greek. Along with a large amount of shared vocabulary, the Romance languages share numerous features of morphology and syntax because they are all continuations of their common ancestor, Latin. When considered a separate language, the Scots language is considered to be a sister language of English, as they are both descended from the common ancestor Old English (via Early Middle English). (Some people consider Scots to be a register or style of Scottish English.) The phonological development of the two languages is divergent, with different loanwords entering each language from sources such as Norse, Latin and French. Political and cultural events have largely dictated the decline of broad Scots as a standard variety in the modern period, and Scots is currently confined to largely spoken use and unofficial functions.Smith, Older Scots A Linguistic Reader, (Scottish Text Society: Edinburgh, 202 2) See also * Language family *Lexical similarity * Daughter language References Category:Historical linguistics ","title":"Sister language"},{"id":"4230022","text":"(reformed) or (traditional) is a German proverbial expression which translates as \\"there must be order\\".

As a slogan used by Paul von Hindenburg, it became \\"world famous\\" in 1930, according to The New York Times.

The \\"Quietist\\" heresy was seen to consist of wrongly elevating \\"contemplation\\" over \\"meditation\\", intellectual stillness over vocal prayer, and interior passivity over pious action in an account of mystical prayer, spiritual growth and union with God (one in which, the accusation ran, there existed the possibility of achieving a sinless state and union with the Christian Godhead). Since the late seventeenth century, \\"Quietism\\" has functioned (especially within Roman Catholic theology, though also to an extent within Protestant theology), as the shorthand for accounts which are perceived to fall foul of the same theological errors, and thus to be heretical. As such, the term has come to be applied to beliefs far outside its original context. The term quietism was not used until the 17th century, so some writers have dubbed the expression of such errors before this era as \\"pre-quietism\\". (thesis) Key features of \\"Quietism\\" Although both Molinos and other authors condemned in the late seventeenth century, as well as their opponents, spoke of the Quietists (in other words, those who were devoted to the \\"prayer of quiet\\", an expression used by Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross and others), \\"Quietism\\" was a creation of its opponents, a somewhat artificial systematisation made on the basis of ecclesiastical condemnations and commentary upon them. No single author – even Molinos, generally seen as the main representative of Quietist thought – advocated all the positions that formed the Quietism of later Catholic doctrinal textbooks; as such, at least one author suggests that it is better to speak of a Quietist tendency or orientation, one which may be located in analogous forms through Christian history. The Quietist controversy of the 1670s and 1680s Miguel de Molinos Quietism is particularly associated with Miguel de Molinos, referred to by the Catholic Encyclopedia as the \\"founder\\" of Quietism. Molinos and the doctrines of quietism were finally condemned by Pope Innocent XI in the Bull Coelestis Pastor of 1687. Molinos was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo, where he died in 1696. Quietism in France Quietism spread among Roman Catholics through small groups into France. Here it was also influenced by the thought of François de Sales, with his emphasis on pure love resulting from spiritual practice. The most noted representative was Mme Guyon, especially with her work A Short and Easy Method of Prayer, who claimed not to have known the teaching of Molinos directly, but certainly did have contact with François Malaval, a proponent of Molinos. Madame Guyon won an influential convert at the court of Louis XIV in Madame de Maintenon, and influenced the circle of devout Catholics in the court for a time. She was also a spiritual counsellor to Archbishop Fénelon of Cambrai. A commission in France found most of Madame Guyon's works intolerable and the government confined her, first in a convent, then in the Bastille, leading eventually to her exile to Blois in 1703.Ward, Patricia A. \\"Quietism\\", in The Cambridge Dictionary of Christian Theology, (Cambridge, 2011). In 1699, after Fénelon's spirited defense in a press war with Bossuet, Pope Innocent XII prohibited the circulation of Fénelon's Maxims of the Saints, to which Fénelon submitted at once. The inquisition's proceedings against remaining quietists in Italy lasted until the eighteenth century. Jean Pierre de Caussade, the Jesuit and author of the spiritual treatise Abandonment to Divine Providence, was forced to withdraw for two years (1731–1733) from his position as spiritual director to a community of nuns after he was suspected of Quietism (a charge of which he was acquitted).Sheldrake, Philip (2013). Spirituality: A Brief History. p. 129 John Wiley & Sons. Analogous sets of beliefs It is possible to isolate similar tendencies (and similar concerns from the accusers) as those condemned in the seventeenth century \\"Quietist\\" controversy in earlier periods. In Hellenistic philosophy, the state of imperturbable serenity or ataraxia was seen as a desirable state of mind by Pyrrhonian, Epicurean, and Stoic philosophers. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, an analogous dispute might be located in Hesychasm in which \\"the supreme aim of life on earth is the contemplation of the uncreated light whereby man is intimately united with God\\". In early Christianity, suspicion over forms of mystical teaching may be seen as controversies over Gnosticism in the second and third centuries, and over the Messalian heresy in the fourth and fifth centuries. The Cathars' denial of the need for sacerdotal rites has been perceived as a form of quietism. Likewise, the twelfth and thirteenth-century Brethren of the Free Spirit, Beguines and Beghards were all accused of holding beliefs with similarities to those condemned in the Quietist controversy. Among the ideas seen as errors and condemned by the Council of Vienne (1311–12) are the propositions that humankind in the present life can attain such a degree of perfection as to become utterly sinless; that the \\"perfect\\" have no need to fast or pray, but may freely grant the body whatsoever it craves. This may be a tacit reference to the Cathars or Albigenses of southern France and Catalonia, and that they are not subject to any human authority or bound by the precepts of the Church. Similar assertions of individual autonomy on the part of the Fraticelli led to their condemnation by John XXII in 1317. Alternatively, it is likely to be a direct reference to the so-called Beguine, Margaret Porette, burned alive at the stake in Paris in 1310 formally as a relapsed heretic, but also on account of her work \\"The Mirror of Simple Souls\\", written, importantly in the French vernacular. Margaret is truly unique in her thought, but that the perfected soul becomes free of virtue and of its obligations and of those of the church she states clearly in her work and it is a theme throughout. The condemnation of the errors of Meister Eckhart in 1329 may also be seen as an instance of an analogous concern in Christian history. Eckhart's assertions that we are totally transformed into God just as in the sacrament the bread is changed into the body of Christ (see transubstantiation) and the value of internal actions, which are wrought by the Godhead abiding within us, have often been linked to later Quietist heresies. In early sixteenth century Spain, concern over a set of beliefs held by those known as alumbrados raised similar concerns to those of Quietism. These concerns continued into the mid-sixteenth century, and the writings of Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. Both were very active reformers and both cautioned against a simple-minded \\"don't think anything\\" (no pensar nada) approach to meditation and contemplation; further, both acknowledged the authority of the Catholic Church and did not oppose its teaching concerning contemplative prayer. Thus, their work was not condemned as heresy, being consistent with Church teaching. This did not stop John's work, however, coming under suspicion after his death; the fact he was not canonised until 1726 is largely due to seventeenth-century suspicions of beliefs similar to those termed \\"Quietist\\" later in the century. George Fox came to the conclusion that the only real spirituality was achieved by paying attention to the Holy Spirit (the godhead) through silence, and founded the Quaker movement on this basis – one which shared much resemblance with \\"Quietist\\" thought. Quietist thinking was also influential among the British Quakers of the later 19th century, when the tract A Reasonable Faith, by Three Friends (William Pollard, Francis Frith and W. E. Turner (1884 and 1886)) caused sharp controversy with evangelicals in the society.

The club currently plays in the Brisbane Premier League, the first tier of senior football in Brisbane (third tier in Queensland and fourth overall in Australia).  History  The club was initially formed in 1952 under the name HNK Croatia Brisbane but struggled to sustain a full squad of players for the entire season, so the club disbanded. With the steady growth of the Croatian community in following years, the club was reformed in 1957. On 15 May 1957 the club was registered with the governing federation as an official soccer club. The club also played under the names New Farm SC (from 1971-1974), Sunnyside United SC (1975-1987), Croatia Soccer Club (1988), Brisbane Croatia Soccer Club and Rocklea United SC. In the early years the club played at council grounds throughout Brisbane until 1970, when the local Croatian community purchased 50-odd acres of land at Rocklea, an inner city south-west suburb of Brisbane. In the 1980s the club competed in the Brisbane Premier League.  Recent History  After relegation from the Capital League 1 in 2013, the Knights managed immediate promotion in 2014, finishing runners up in the Capital League 2. In 2015, Knights finished fifth in League 1. Brisbane Knights hosted the 41st annual Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament in October 2015. It was the fourth time the Queensland club hosted the tournament, having previously hosted in 1982 (winning the tournament for the first and only time to date), 1989 and 2001. Melbourne Knights FC took out their sixth title at the tournament. After another mid-table finish in 2016, Knights finished in third place in League 1 in 2017 and were promoted back to the Brisbane Premier League due to a league re-structure, where Football Queensland Premier League became the new state- wide second tier and the BPL became the third state tier. The Knights finished in the lower half of the BPL table in both 2018 and 2019. In January 2020, it was announced that Gold Coast Knights SC had assumed control of Brisbane Knights Football Club.

Modern Ithaca can be seen to the west Ulysses meets his father Laertes on Ithaca (Theodoor van Thulden, 1600) Ithaca (; Greek: Ιθάκη, Ithakē) was, in Greek mythology, the island home of the hero Odysseus. The specific location of the island, as it was described in Homer's Odyssey, is a matter for debate. There have been various theories about its location. Modern Ithaki has traditionally been accepted to be Homer's island. One recent alternative candidate is Paliki, which may have been an island separated from the rest of Kefalonia, as argued by Bittlestone, Diggle and Underhill in Odysseus Unbound. This theory has not been generally accepted, however, on grounds of geology, Kalliopi Gaki-Papanastassiou and others, “Geomorphological study and paleogeographic evolution of NW Kefalonia Island, Greece, concerning the hypothesis of a possible location of the Homeric Ithaca,” in Geoarchaeology, Climate Change, and Sustainability, Geological Society of America, Special Paper 476, 2011, pp. 78-79. archaeology, Christina Souyoudzoglou-Haywood, “Archaeology and the search for Homeric Ithaca: the case of Mycenaean Kephalonia,” Acta Archaeologica, vol. 89, no. 1 (December, 2018), pp. 145-158. philology,George Huxley, Review of Odysseus Unbound in Hermathena, no. 182 (Summer 2007), pp. 165-169; Barbara Graziosi, Review of Odysseus Unbound in Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. 128 (November, 2008), pp. 178-180. or historical and Homeric analysis.Jonathan Brown, In search of Homeric Ithaca (Canberra: Parrot Press, 2020), pp. 321-333. “What is clearly missing,” wrote Dr Christine Haywood reviewing Odysseus Unbound, “is a good knowledge of the complexities of Homeric language, and the support of archaeology.” Classics Ireland, vol. 14 (2007), p. 90. The central characters of the epic such as Odysseus, Achilles, Agamemnon and Hector are generally believed to be fictional characters. Yet there are many claims that some Homeric hero long ago had inhabited a particular contemporary region or village. This, and the extremely detailed geographic descriptions in the epic itself, have invited investigation of the possibility that Homer's heroes might have existed and that the location of the sites described therein might be found. Heinrich Schliemann believed he tracked down several of the more famous traditions surrounding these heroes. Many locations around the Mediterranean were claimed to have been the heroes' \\"homes\\", such as the ruins at Mycenae and the little hill near the western Turkish town of Hissarlik. Schliemann's work and excavations proposed, to a very sceptical world, that Homer's Agamemnon had lived at Mycenae, and that \\"Troy\\" itself indeed had existed at Hisarlik. Much work has been done to identify other Homeric sites such as the palace of Nestor at Pylos. These attempts have been the subject of much scholarly research, archaeological work, and controversy. Theories on the location of \\"Homer's 'Ithaca'\\" were formulated as early as the 2nd century BC to as recently as AD 2005. Each approach to identifying a location has been different, varying in degrees of scientific procedure, empirical investigation, informed hypothesis, wishful thinking, fervent belief, and sheer fantasy. Each investigator and each investigation merits interest, as an indicator both of the temper of the times in which a particular theory was developed, and of the perennial interest in Odysseus and the possible facts of his life.

It combined the various cities of Arcadia, in the Peloponnese, into a single state. The league was founded in 370 BC, taking advantage of the decreased power of Sparta, which had previously dominated and controlled Arcadia. Mantinea, a city that had suffered under Spartan dominance, was particularly prominent in pushing for its founding. The league was responsible for the foundation of Megalopolis. Although initially successful in resisting Spartan influence in Arcadia, the league was soon divided in the power struggles that engulfed Greece in the 4th century BC. Thebes, which had been instrumental in the founding of the league, soon came into conflict with Mantinea. At the Battle of Mantinea (362 BC), the cities of the league fought against each other, Mantinea fighting alongside Sparta and Athens, while Tegea and others sided with Thebes. Arcadia and the Peloponnese before 370 Beginning in the 6th century BC and continuing through the 5th and early 4th centuries, Sparta dominated the Peloponnese, and compelled its neighbors to join its Peloponnesian League and fight in its wars. This dominance naturally aroused anger amongst these neighboring states, and Sparta's allies proved themselves willing to rise up against their overlord on several occasions. In 418 BC, Mantinea joined a league of Peloponnesian democratic states that briefly pursued an anti-Spartan policy before being defeated at the Battle of Mantinea (418 BC). After the end of the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, Sparta, under king Agesilaus, took several opportunities over the ensuing years to discipline a number of restive allies. In 385 BC, the Spartans attacked Mantinea and forced the city to dissolve, splitting it into five separate villages, each of which was governed by a Spartan-backed oligarchy.. Oligarchic governments throughout the rest of Arcadia also received Spartan support. The Spartan military dominance that enabled this interference in Arcadian affairs was suddenly ended in 371 BC, when Epaminondas and his Boeotian army decisively defeated a Spartan army at Leuctra, killing a sizable portion of the elite Spartiate class. This development upset the balance of power in the Peloponnese and opened new possibilities for action by anti-Spartan factions. Formation of the league The first sign of rebellious activity in Arcadia came in the spring of 370 BC, when the city of Mantinea began reassembling from the villages it had been divided into, under democratic leadership. Shortly after this, a number of Arcadian communities began to assemble into a league for mutual protection against Sparta, an effort led by Lycomedes, a Mantinean. Substantial resistance was encountered at Tegea, where an oligarchic government was in power, but Tegean democrats overthrew this government with the aid of Mantinean troops, and the formation of the league proceeded. A Spartan army under Agesilaus was sent to attempt to restore the oligarchs, but achieved nothing. After driving off the Spartans, the Arcadians began work on the new city of Megalopolis, a strongly fortified capital city positioned to serve as a bulwark against Sparta.. Although this first attempt to break up the new league had ended without success, the threat of further military intervention prompted the Arcadians to dispatch ambassadors to Athens, requesting protection. The Athenians were theoretically bound by the terms of a treaty signed in late 371 BC to protect the autonomy of all Greek states, but their desire to maintain the strength of Sparta as a check on the ambitions of the Thebans led them to refuse the Arcadians' request. Continuing to Thebes, however, the Arcadians soon obtained the assistance they sought. A massive Boeotian army, led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, was dispatched to the Peloponnese.. Reaching Arcadia, this army was swelled to some 50,000 to 70,000 men by the arrival of Argive, Elean, and Arcadian forces. For the Spartans to challenge such a massive force in the field would have been little short of suicidal; accordingly, over the next several months, Epaminondas twice led the army south into Spartan territory, first to ravage Laconia and then to liberate Messenia. This latter action, by depriving Sparta of much of her territory and placing a new hostile state on her borders, essentially ended any serious threat to the Arcadians. As the Theban army returned north, the Arcadians were free to go on with organizing their league without fear of Spartan interference.. By 369 BC, most if not all Arcadian states had joined the league.. Government and structure Cities entering the Arcadian league seem to have surrendered a large degree of their autonomy to the federal government. The league maintained a standing army, and a section of the new capital at Megalopolis was filled with federal buildings and barracks for that army. The league conducted a unified foreign policy, led by a chief executive or executives--which is not clear--holding the title of strategos.. The league had a democratic constitution, although how widely the franchise was extended is unclear. The body of voting citizens was known as the myrioi, or \\"ten thousand.\\" If this number is taken as a rough estimate of the actual size of the body, the body would have consisted only of citizens of hoplite class or higher--the upper middle class and up. If, on the other hand, the word is interpreted in its figurative meaning of \\"a very large number,\\" it is possible that the body may have been much larger, possibly including all free males. A smaller council, the Boule, was composed of an unknown number of representatives from the various cities of the federation. This council probably handled administrative matters, and, if it served a similar function to the council of the same name at Athens, may have prepared resolutions to be debated by the myrioi. Finally, 50 officials known as demiourgoi probably served as a working committee of the Boule. History after 370 BC After its establishment in 370 BC, the Arcadian League took an active role in the politics of the Peloponnese. Arcadian soldiers campaigned with a Theban army during Epaminondas's second invasion of the Peloponnese in 369 BC, and continued to campaign in 368 BC, defeating a joint Athenian and Corinthian force, then raiding successfully into Spartan territory, but in the summer of 368 BC, a Spartan force invaded Arcadia and wiped out an Arcadian force without suffering a single casualty, in what became known as the \\"tearless battle.\\" Xenophon asserts that the Arcadians' allies, the Thebans and Eleans, \\"were almost as well pleased as the Lacedaemonians at the misfortune of the Arcadians -- so vexed had they become by this time at their presumption.\\"Xenophon. Hellenica, 7.1.31. After this defeat, the Arcadians hurried the completion of the fortifications at Megalopolis to prevent further Spartan incursions.. The league's military fortunes revived over the next few years, however, and in 365 BC the league fought and won a war against Elis.. In 364 BC, the Arcadian strategos Aeneas of Stymphalos intervened in Sicyon, expelling the tyrant of that city. A Theban army had invaded the Peloponnese in 366 BC, but the purpose of that expedition was to establish Achaea as a counterweight to Arcadian influence; although this effort was largely a failure, it antagonized leading Arcadians. Accordingly, in that same year, Lycomedes persuaded the myrioi to make an alliance with Athens; the Athenians, although reluctant to ally with enemies of their allies the Spartans, could not pass up such a chance to undermine Theban influence.. By 362 BC, the question of whether to continue as an ally of Thebes had become so pressing as to divide the Arcadian League, with Mantinea siding with Sparta and Athens while Tegea and Megalopolis remained loyal to Thebes. Thus, the cities of the league fought on different sides at the Battle of Mantinea in that year. That battle, a Theban victory, was followed by a Common Peace which brought peace to the region for a time. Although it never regained the prominence it had held during the 360s BC, an Arcadian league in some form--whether a continuation or a recreation of the original league is unclear--continued to exist in the years after the Battle of Mantinea. Various references indicate that the league endured at least into the 3rd century BC. According to an obscure passage in Pausanias, the Arcadian League may have experienced a short period of revival between 250 and 245 BC, after the liberation of Megalopolis from tyranny.Pausanias. Description of Greece, VIII.10. The date of its final disappearance is uncertain, but at the latest it had vanished by the 230s BC, as the Arcadian cities joined the Achaean League.

It currently takes place during Winter and, in certain regions, Carnival and is one of the oldest traditions being practiced in Portugal still today. Although there are \\"rituals\\" practiced at the village of Lazarim (Lamego, Viseu District), these are not of Celtic origin as their origin is only registered as starting on the second half of the last century. Caretos are masked young men dressed in suits made of colourful fringe wool quilts, wearing brass, leather or wooden masks and rattles in their belts. Shrove Tuesday and the prior Sunday are the days when the Caretos are most active. They appear in groups from every corner of the village running and shouting excitedly, frightening the people and “robbing” all the wineries. The main target of these masquerade groups are single young girls, who make them climb to the top of walls and verandas.

Lying on the shores of the Strait of Gibraltar, the town was originally a fishing village and trade link when it was settled some 2,000 years ago. Although prosperous at the time of Emperor Claudius, it went into a decline hastened by earthquakes and was abandoned by the 6th century. The study of its architectural remains shows its Roman origin at the end of the 2nd century BC, already observed since that time a great wealth that makes it an important economic center in the Mediterranean area. History A model of the city Baelo Claudia is situated on the northern shore of the Strait of Gibraltar. The town was founded in the end of the 2nd century BC as a result of trade with North Africa (it was a major port for Tangier, in Mauretania Tingitana, for example). It is possible that Baelo Claudia had some functions of governmental administration, but tuna fishing, salting, and the production of garum were the primary sources of wealth. The city was eventually successful enough to be granted the title of municipium by Emperor Claudius. The life of the inhabitants reached its greatest splendor during the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD. In the middle of the 2nd century, however, the town declined, probably as a result of a major earthquake which wiped out a large part. In addition to such natural disasters, by the 3rd century, the town was beset by hordes of pirates, both Germanic and Barbary. Although it experienced a slight renaissance later in the century, by the 6th century, the town had been abandoned. Excavations have revealed the most comprehensive remains of a Roman town in the whole of the Iberian Peninsula, with extremely interesting monuments such as the basilica, theatre, market, and the temple of Isis. The spectacular setting in El Estrecho Natural Park allows the visitor to see the coast of Morocco. A modern Visitor Centre showcases many artefacts and has a comprehensive introduction to the site. It also offers parking, shade, toilets, a shop and good views of the sea. Admission is free to citizens of the European Economic Area on production of an ID card. The archeological site The figure of Jorge Bonsor is key in the recovery of the archaeological site. In its urban layout are distinguished the two main classical routes of the Roman city: the decumanus maximus , which ran from East to West and at the ends were located the entrance to the city, and the cardo maximus , which crosses it at a right angle and therefore in a north-south direction. In the meeting of these two main streets was the forum or main square, whose current pavement is the original slabs of Tarifa preserved since the 1st century, and around which the main public buildings were distributed. This was an open square with porticos on three sides, from one of which three of them were accessed: the emperor's temple, the curia, and another that served as a meeting room. The main building, located in the background is the basilica, for various purposes and especially the seat of the courts of justice; and on the left side there were small rectangular constructions made of stones: the shops or tabernaes. In the archaeological site the most representative elements that constituted the essence of a Roman city are preserved. This one had: * A walls, reinforced with more than forty watchtowers, of which the main gates of the city are conserved, the one that was directed to Gades, to the west, and the one that was directed a Carteia (near San Roque). Towards the East, there existed a third door located to the north of the city, called Puerta de Asido. * Buildings of an administrative nature such as curia (local senate) or the municipal archive. * A public square (forum). * A courthouse (judicial basilica), located in the forum in front of the temples. It has rectangular plant and measures 19.5 by 35.5 meters. It was presided by a statue of the emperor Trajan more than three meters high. * Four temples: three dedicated to each of the components of the Capitoline Triad (Jupiter, Juno and Minerva) and one dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Isis, related to the Isiac cult in the peninsula, recently discovered by a group of archaeologists of Histdeutsch. A similar provision has only been found in the city of Sbeitla in Tunisia. * The largest building in Baelo Claudia is the theater, with a capacity of up to 2000 people, where all the actors were men, even in the roles of women, which to interpret were they put on masks, depending on the character they represented. * You can also see remains of the shops (tabernae), the market (macellum), enclosed area intended for the sale of meat and edible in general and formed by fourteen stores and an inner courtyard ;, and the hot springs (thermae). The water supply of the city was carried out by means of four aqueducts. The industrial area can also be seen with remains of the garum manufacturing facilities, streets, aqueducts, remnants of the sewerage system, etc. In no other Roman site of the Iberian Peninsula is it possible to extract after the visit such a complete vision of Roman urbanism as in Baelo Claudia. In this lies its main interest, highlighted also by the spectacular landscape that surrounds the city. Bien de Interés Cultural, its publication as a Monument appeared in La Gaceta de Madrid, in the year 1925. The archaeological site has been accompanied by a museum since 2007, incorporated into the Institutional Headquarters and Visitors Center of the Archaeological Site of Baelo Claudia, designed by the architect Guillermo Vázquez Consuegra.«The new museum of Baelo Claudia shows the singularity and the rise of the Roman city» Diario Sur File:Capitel romano Baelo Claudia.jpgA Roman capital File:Factoría de salazones 001.jpgRuins of a factory for salted fish and garum (fish sauce) File:Escultura romana Baelo Claudia.jpgStatue of a lady or goddess with a palla and stola File:Basílica Baelo 001.jpgThe basilica File:Acueducto Baelo.JPGAn aqueduct  The current site  The archaeological site is next to a tourist area, so it is beginning to exploit its potential cultural tourism. The site is easily accessed and visits are free, except for foreigners who must pay a fee to visit it. The Junta de Andalucía has built a new Visitor Reception Center (of which the architect is Guillermo Vázquez Consuegra) and has carried out a Landscape Action Project in the Ensenada de Bolonia (written and executed by the Andalusian Institute of Historical Heritage between 2010 and 2013). Likewise the University of Cádiz conducts studies of the site, giving rise to new discoveries, as the only copy of the Doryphoros of Polykleitos in Hispania.

She rose to fame in the mid-1960s and charted fifteen singles on the Billboard C&W; charts between 1965 and 1975. Background Wilma Burgess was born and raised in Orlando, Florida. Following high school graduation she proceeded to Stetson University in DeLand, Florida studying physical education. She had no interest in a musical career - although she had displayed her natural talent performing as a Pop singer on local television - until hearing Eddy Arnold in concert awakened her passion for C&W; music. In 1960 a songwriter friend of Burgess persuaded her to go to Nashville to record some demos of his compositions. One of the publishers Burgess sang for asked to manage her singing career and Burgess cut her first single in the fall of 1962 for the United Artists label. Eventually Burgess came to the attention of Owen Bradley who heard in Burgess' voice the potential for a successor to the recently deceased Patsy Cline who Bradley had produced. Bradley arranged for Burgess' signing with Decca where she had her first session in June 1964. Career peak After three unsuccessful single releases Bradley had Burgess record the Ray Griff song \\"Baby\\" on 24 September 1965: the track proved to be Burgess' breakout hit reaching No. 7 C&W.; Burgess' expertise with teary ballads was further exemplified with the follow- ups \\"Don't Touch Me\\" (#12 C&W;) and \\"Misty Blue\\" (#4) and logically her successful versions of these C&W; classic tunes would have consolidated Burgess' position as a major player on the Nashville scene. However Burgess' versions of both \\"Don't Touch Me\\" and \\"Misty Blue\\" were both overshadowed, the first by the concurrent release of a more successful version of \\"Don't Touch Me\\" by Jeannie Seely - for whom Hank Cochran (then Seely's husband) had written the song. Then \\"Misty Blue\\" - handed down to Burgess after being rejected by Brenda Lee - was shortly established as a trademark song for Burgess' prime influence Eddy Arnold whose version in the spring of 1967 not only reached No. 3 C&W; but became a regional Pop hit reaching No. 57 nationally. 1967 on Continuing to record with Owen Bradley, Burgess placed seven more singles on the C&W; chart but only the first two of these: \\"Fifteen Days\\" (#24) and \\"Tear Time\\" (#15) both 1967 reached the Top 40. Burgess association with Bradley and Decca Records ended in 1971; that same year she signed with Shannon a label owned by Jim Reeves Enterprises (Burgess was a close friend of Reeves' widow Mary Reeves). Five of Burgess' single releases on Shannon appeared on the C&W; chart with the 1973 duet with Bud Logan \\"Wake Me Into Love\\" providing an on-off return to the Top 40 at No. 14\\\\. In 1975 Burgess left Shannon signing with RCA Records where her uneventful tenure lasted until 1978. In 1982 she ended her recording career with the album Could I Have This Dance on 51West a Columbia Records label. Later in the decade Burgess opened the Hitching Post - described as Nashville's first women-only bar - where she regularly performed. Burgess also worked on and off with Mary Reeves running the Jim Reeves Museum in Nashville. It has been noted by Jim Ed Brown that Burgess was also a decent poker player, having taken both Ernest Tubb and Tubb's bus driver's money while on tour together. Burgess was openly lesbian and preferred to record love songs with no gender-specific references. She did sometimes agree to record songs such as \\"Ain't Got No Man\\" on condition that her producer Owen Bradley let her record a song she liked but he didn't. Death Wilma Burgess died unexpectedly Monday, August 26, 2003 at 4:05 a.m. at Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, after suffering a massive heart attack. She was 64, and had been hospitalized for a week for tests, and had seemed to be on the road to recovery.Wilma Burgess at Geocities.com *In 1965 Burgess purchased the Nashville home that had belonged to Patsy Cline; the purchase was made from Cline's widower Charlie Dick. Burgess had attended Cline's 30th birthday party and housewarming at the home six months before Cline's fatal accident. Burgess also purchased Jim Reeves' touring bus \\"Big Blue\\" in 1969. *Burgess appeared in the 1966 film The Las Vegas Hillbillys singing \\"Baby\\". The film which starred Jayne Mansfield was a B-movie that showcased several top C&W; performers.

The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory. The common name arises from their having a hollow, leek- or onion-like leaf. Some species only flower after summer fires and have flowers similar to those of Xanthorrhoea which flower at the same time, suggesting that they employ the same pollinating insects. Leek orchids are similar to those in the genus Genoplesium except that the free part of the leaf is cylindrical (flat in Genoplesium) and the labellum has a solid (rather than flexible) connection to the column. They range in size from the little laughing leek orchid (P. gracile) at about to the king leek orchid (P. regium) which grows up to tall.Labelled image of Prasophyllum elatum flower Description Orchids in the genus Prasophyllum are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs usually with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a pair of more or less spherical tubers partly covered by a fibrous sheath. Replacement tubers form at the end of short root- like stolons. Leek orchids rarely reproduce by forming \\"daughter\\" tubers, relying on their flowers for reproduction. A single onion or leek-like leaf develops near the base of the plant and accounts for the common name of the group. The leaf is long, narrow, hollow, cylindrical and glabrous. The inflorescence is a spike or raceme with a few to many non-resupinate flowers breaking through a thin part of the leaf. The dorsal sepal is wider than two lateral sepals which are often joined. The petals are often curved, shorter and narrower than the sepals. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum, differing markedly from the other petals and sepals. The labellum is positioned above the column and rigidly attached to its base. Its edges are usually wavy and rolled back. The labellum has a callus which consists of a raised, fleshy plate which is usually channelled, with the base forming an inverted basin shape. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column which is short and has narrow wings, often with a small lobe at the front. Leek orchids usually flower between late winter and early summer, depending on species, and the fruit that follows flowering is a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus Prasophyllum was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. Brown described twelve species but did not name a type species, however in 1989, Mark Clements nominated P. australe as the lectotype. The name Prasophyllum is derived from the Ancient Greek words prason meaning \\"leek\\" and phyllon meaning \\"leaf\\". Distribution and habitat Leek orchids occur in all states of Australia, but not in the Northern Territory. There are 20 named species in Western Australia as well as a further 40 that have been discovered but not as yet described. There are 28 species in Tasmania, about 40 in New South Wales and 15 in South Australia. New Zealand has about 6 species, occurring on both main islands as well as Stewart and Chatham Islands. In Western Australia alone, they grow in a range of habitats from the margins of salt lakes, to swamps and dense Karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forests. Ecology Prasophyllum species are mycotrophic, requiring symbiotic fungi for seed germination. The main fungus is Ceratobasidium cornigerum. Many Western Australian species only flower after summer fires and in other years only produce leaves. Most flowers are strongly scented, produce nectar and are pollinated by insects but a few appear able to self-pollinated if not visited. They often have flowers similar to grass trees in the genus Xanthorrhoea, flower under similar conditions and are visited by a similar range of insects, suggesting that they mimic grass tree flowers.  Species  As at October 2017, about 140 species are recognised by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. Eight species described in 2017 are not included on the Checklist yet but are included in the International Plant Names Index. They are P. crassum, P. nitidum, P. roseum, P. rousei, P. stygium, P. sylvicola, P. spadiceum and P. tortilis.

Many of the party's candidates have their own biography pages; information about others may be found here. Albert Koehl (Trinity—Spadina) Koehl was a lawyer for the provincial Environment Ministry during the early 1990s (Globe and Mail, 4 June 1992), and later worked as a war crimes investigator for the United Nations. In 1998, he contributed to a UN report on past human rights abuses in Guatemala. He has also worked with aboriginal groups in Guatemala, and with Guatemalan refugees in Mexico. In 2003, he wrote against General Efraín Ríos Montt's bid to return as President of Guatemala (Toronto Star, 9 November 2003). He received 9,817 votes (27.48%), finishing second against New Democratic Party incumbent Rosario Marchese. He was 39 years old (Toronto Star, 17 May 1999). Koehl later became a founding member of the Education Rights Task Force, and has written about the difficulties faced by the children of illegal immigrants in attaining education in Canada (Toronto Star, 10 May 2002). In 2005, he supported the provincial government of Dalton McGuinty's decision to remove an attendance fee for the children of some recent immigrants (Canada NewsWire, 19 May 2005). He is also a lawyer with the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, and has written in support of the Kyoto Accord (Globe and Mail, 28 August 2002). In 2003, he spoke out against plans for a logging road network near Pukaskwa National Park in Northern Ontario (Broadcast News, 12 August 2003). Costas Manios (Scarborough Centre) Costas Manios (born in Greece) is a politician in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A Liberal, he was nevertheless involved in a serious controversy with Ontario Liberal Party in the 2003 provincial election. Prior to running for the provincial Liberal party, Manios was an executive assistant in the office of federal Liberal Member of Parliament John Cannis. He was also a membership coordinator for the federal Liberal party in Ontario, and served as an executive director of the Hellenic-Canadian Federation of Ontario. Manios first campaigned for the Ontario legislature in the 1999 provincial election, against Progressive Conservative incumbent Marilyn Mushinski in the eastern Toronto riding of Scarborough Centre. Although Manios did not have a strong public profile when the election was called, he came within 4,000 votes of defeating Mushinski, and many believe he would have been elected had not been for vote-splitting with New Democratic Party candidate Sid Ryan, who received about 20% of the vote and took third-place. After the election, Manios undertook extensive promotional work for the Liberal Party in Toronto. Manios intended to run as a Liberal again in the 2003 election, and was bitterly disappointed when party leader Dalton McGuinty appointed Brad Duguid as the party's candidate in Scarborough Centre instead. (Such appointments are permitted under the constitution of the Ontario Liberal Party, but are not commonly utilized.) Manios and his supporters claimed that McGuinty had previously given Manios full sanction to run for the Liberal nomination again, and described Duguid's appointment as a betrayal of trust. With the support of the local Liberal riding association, Manios entered the race as a \\"liberal independent candidate\\". He officially appeared on the ballot as an independent, but used Liberal red and white colours in his campaign handouts. Manios had a support base in Scarborough's Greek community, and many believed that he could split the vote with Duguid to allow Mushinski another victory. In the event, however, provincial trends overrode local factors. Duguid won a convincing majority over Mushinski, as the Liberals formed a majority government provincially. Manios finished fourth, behind Michael Laxer of the NDP, with 3,259 votes (7.82%). His vote total, while credible for an independent candidate, was not enough to influence the outcome. After the election, Manios claimed that McGuinty and his supporters had drifted away from the party's principles. 1999 ","title":"Ontario Liberal Party candidates in the 1999 Ontario provincial election"},{"id":"4230220","text":"Wörth or Woerth may refer to:  Places   Germany  *Wörth am Main, Miltenberg district, Bavaria *Wörth am Rhein, Germersheim district, Rhineland- Palatinate *Wörth an der Donau, Regensburg district, Bavaria *Wörth an der Isar, Landshut district, Bavaria *Wörth, Upper Bavaria, Erding district, Bavaria *Donauwörth, Donau-Ries district, Bavaria *Wörth, Worthsee, an island in Lake Wörth, Bavaria, Germany  Elsewhere  *Wœrth, a town in Bas-Rhin, Alsace, France *Wörth Castle, Neuhausen am Rheinfall in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland *Lake Wörth (disambiguation), multiple lakes  Other uses  *SMS Wörth, an 1892 ship of the German Navy *Battle of Wœrth, fought in 1870, near Wœrth, Alsace, France *Éric Woerth (born 1956), French politician ","title":"Wörth"},{"id":"4230224","text":"Sand Ridge or Sandridge may refer to: Places In Australia * Electoral district of Sandridge, Victoria * Port Melbourne, Victoria, historically known as Sandridge In the United Kingdom * Sandridge, Hertfordshire, a village and civil parish * Sandridge, Stoke Gabriel, Devon * Sandridge, Wiltshire In the United States * Sand Ridge neighborhood, Southwest community, Birmingham, Alabama * Sand Ridge Township, Jackson County, Illinois * Sand Ridge State Forest, Mason County, Illinois * Sand Ridge, Indiana, an unincorporated community * Sand Ridge, New York, a hamlet and census-designated place * Sand Ridge, Houston County, Texas, an unincorporated community * Sand Ridge, Wharton County, Texas, an unincorporated community * Sand Ridge, West Virginia, an unincorporated community * Sand Ridge, a Tulare Lake sandspit that once formed a chain of islands in California.

It is a translation, probably by Stephenson himself, of \\"Leiningens Kampf mit den Ameisen\\" which was originally published in German in 1938. Plot summary Leiningen, the owner of a plantation in the Brazilian rainforest, is warned by the district commissioner that a swarm of ferocious and organised soldier ants is approaching and that he must flee. Unlike his neighbours, Leiningen is not about to give up years of hard work and planning to \\"an act of God\\", as he believes in the superiority of the human brain and has already made preparations. He convinces his workers to stay and fight with him. When the ants reach his estate, Leiningen seals it by filling a moat that surrounds it on three sides, the fourth being a river. The ants attempt to cross over by covering the waters with tree leaves, but he thwarts them repeatedly by emptying then flooding the moat. Eventually, the ants breach that line of defence and the men retreat behind a second moat, this time filled with petrol. Leiningen is able to incinerate several waves of attack, but runs out of petrol when the pumps malfunction. After days of hard fighting, the ants breach the last defenses, and all seems lost. However, Leiningen realizes that his original principle of canals and damming can be put to use: if he dams the main river itself, the whole plantation will flood, drowning all the ants. He and his men can take refuge in the heights of the manor house on a hill. However, this plan requires reaching the dam, long overrun by the ants. Leiningen puts on a makeshift protective suit, douses himself with petrol, picks up two spray cans of petrol and runs for the dam — through the ants. He reaches the dam controls and floods the plantation; this means the destruction of his year's crop, but it will save his men, preserve the contents of his granaries and destroy the menace of the ants. The climax of the story occurs on the return journey when he is knocked down by the ants and almost devoured. Thinking about a stag he had seen the ants devour to the bones, he forces himself to get up. Despite suffering horrible injuries, including ant bites to the inside of his nose and directly below his eyes, Leiningen continues running, reaches the concrete ditch with the blazing petrol and survives. At the story's end, Leiningen awakes while recovering from his injuries; his final words before going to sleep are: \\"I told you I would come back, even if I am a bit streamlined.\\" Adaptations William Conrad, 1952 In 1948, the story was adapted into a radio play as part of the CBS Radio series, Escape Radio script genericradio.com.

It is produced in a variety of finishes, calibers, and barrel lengths. History In the early 1950s, Westerns were popular in movies and television. Colt had discontinued the iconic Single Action Army prior to World War II, and few single-action revolvers were available to meet market demand for cowboy-style revolvers. In 1953, the new firm of Sturm, Ruger & Company introduced the Single-Six, a .22 LR rimfire single-action revolver. The Single-Six proved to be a popular seller, leading Ruger to develop and market a centerfire revolver similar to the Single Action Army: the Ruger Blackhawk. Ruger introduced the Blackhawk in 1955. Chambered for the .357 Magnum, the Blackhawk was a simple and strong design, and it sold well. In 1956, as Smith & Wesson was introducing the new .44 Magnum, Ruger quickly developed a variant of the Blackhawk in the new cartridge. Ruger achieved wide popularity with this firearm in a hotly anticipated new cartridge, which was both cheaper and more readily available than the Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver. According to popular legend, Ruger was able to field a .44 Magnum revolver at nearly the same time as Smith & Wesson due to a Ruger employee finding expended .44 Magnum cartridge cases at a scrapyard and deducing that Smith & Wesson was about to launch a new cartridge.Sturm Ruger booklet \\"Fifty Years of .44 Magnums\\"Sixguns.com The 1955–1962 Blackhawks are known today as the \\"Flattop\\" models, because their adjustable rear sights were not protected by \\"ears\\" extending up from the frame as later became standard. From 1962 through 1972, Ruger made the \\"Three Screw\\" Blackhawk in various calibers, so called by the number of screws visible on the side of the revolver. The Flattop and Three Screw Rugers were modernized compared to the Colt Single Action Army, in that they had adjustable sights instead of the Colt's fixed sights, and they used wire coil springs instead of the Colt's flat leaf springs. Bill Ruger chose coil springs due to their greater durability, saying that it solved one of the primary weaknesses of the Colt design. The early models of the Blackhawk still operated the same way as the Colt, in that the hammer was half-cocked to load and unload and that the firearm was not safe to carry with all six chambers loaded due to the hammer resting upon the sixth chamber. In 1973, in order to eliminate accidents occurring from the hammer jarring against a round loaded in the sixth chamber, Ruger introduced the New Model Blackhawk. The New Model Blackhawk did not require the hammer to be half-cocked for loading and unloading, and it employed a transfer bar mechanism which prevented the cartridge under the hammer from being fired without the trigger being pulled. The New Blackhawk was seen as limiting firearms accidents and legal liability. Ruger then began offering a retrofit program, offering free transfer bar conversions to earlier variants of the Blackhawk. It is worth noting that the Super Blackhawk is capable of operating with much higher pressure handloads than factory produced ammunition in .44 Magnum. Factory produced loads, such as Federal Champion 240 gr JSP loads are right around 800 ft-lbs muzzle energy. Loads in excess of 1200 ft-lbs muzzle energy are commonly produced by handloaders for this caliber and the Super Blackhawk can, in fact, handle more powerful loads than any .44 Magnum lever action rifle and substantially more powerful rounds than any double action .44 Magnum revolver. Buffalo Bore makes a heavy load that is in excess of 1500 ft- lbs muzzle energy. These facts make the Ruger Super Blackhawk one of the top choices for handgun hunting. It is capable of reliably taking down deer, elk, caribou, moose, lion, grizzly or brown bear and even cape buffalo. It is commonly used to deliver a coup de grace shot to mortally wounded large game, having the ability to dispatch even an elephant with a conscientiously placed close range shot to the head. The wide availability of .44 Magnum cases and bullets make the .44 Magnum chambering far more practical than .454 Casull or .480 Ruger, while allowing for similar ballistics in custom loadings. The Ruger Super Blackhawk in .44 Magnum is one of the most accurate big bore pistols for target shooting, typically returning 5 shot groups that are one ragged hole from a rest at 25 yards. Work is commonly performed on the action of these revolvers to give a light, crisp trigger pull, thereby contributing to accuracy. Various models Ruger Old Model Super Blackhawk Ruger New Model Super Blackhawk and Javelina The Ruger Old Army is a 45-caliber percussion revolver based on the Ruger Blackhawk action. The Blackhawk is a popular base gun for custom work. This one is a cooperative effort by members of the American Pistolsmith's Guild. Variation of Ruger Blackhawk of all-steel construction and a number of retro features including .357-size frame and steel micro sight. There is a Bisley Grip Variation and a selection of calibers-.44 Special pictured. Over the years the Blackhawk has appeared in a wide variety of models. These models include: *New Model Blackhawk: Produced in blued steel in .30 Carbine, .357 Magnum, .41 Remington Magnum, .44 Special, and .45 Colt; produced in stainless in .327 Federal Magnum with an 8-round cylinder, .357 Magnum, and .45 Colt. Multiple barrel lengths were offered in many of these configurations. *New Model Blackhawk Convertible: The cylinder of a Blackhawk is easily removed, and can be replaced with a cylinder for a different cartridge of the same diameter. Ruger has offered \\"convertible\\" cylinder revolvers in .45 Colt/.45 ACP, .38-40/10mm Auto, and .357 Magnum/9×19mm Parabellum. Other than being sold with multiple cylinders, these firearms are identical to the Blackhawk. *New Model Super Blackhawk: Produced in blued and stainless, with or without a rib for mounting a scope. The Super Blackhawk is built on the same frame, but with a larger grip (in the 7.5\\" and 10.5\\" barrels) and unfluted cylinder (except for 5.5\\" barrel), in order to more effectively deal with the .44 Magnum's recoil. Also, the grip frames are made of steel, versus aluminium for those same components in the Blackhawk. Ejector rod housings were originally steel on old model Super Blackhawks. The new model stainless steel versions have steel ejector rod housings. *Vaquero and New Vaquero: With the popularity of Cowboy Action Shooting came demand for a single-action revolver that was more traditional in appearance. As the standard Ruger Blackhawk departs from the Single Action Army looks due to its adjustable sights, Ruger offered a fixed-sight equivalent to cater to buyers wanting a more traditional appearance. In all other ways, the Vaquero was identical to the Blackhawk, though offered in slightly fewer variants. The original Vaquero was offered in .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .45 Colt. After some time, Ruger went with a smaller frame to more closely resemble the actual size of the Colt SAA, changed the name to the New Vaquero, and dropped the powerful .44 Magnum from the lineup. While keeping the smaller size, Ruger later went back to the simple Vaquero name. *Bisley: The Bisley grip is a type of angled grip developed by Colt for target shooting at the end of the 19th Century. Ruger's \\"Bisley\\" offerings incorporated a Bisley-style grip, hammer spur, and trigger.

He was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 31, 2002, but refused to report to the Pirates, choosing to retire instead. He is best remembered for his seasons with the Giants and Red Sox. Dusty Baker, who managed the Giants during Lewis' tenure with San Francisco, named his own son after him.  Career  During his 13-year career, he established himself as one of top base stealers of the 1990s. He won a NL Gold Glove Award as a member of the Giants in 1994. He made postseason appearances with the Reds in 1995, and in 1998, 1999 with the Red Sox.  Errorless streak On June 17, 1993, while playing for the San Francisco Giants, Lewis set a major league record by playing his 243rd consecutive errorless game, the longest stretch ever by an outfielder to begin a career. On July 16, 1993 against the New York Mets, he broke Don Demeter's all-time MLB record by playing his 267th consecutive game without an error. The streak continued until June 30, 1994, when the Giants played the Montreal Expos. Lewis was charged with his first error in 392 Major League games (938 chances) when he allowed Cliff Floyd's base hit to skip under his glove. His record was later broken by Atlanta Braves' right fielder Nick Markakis on June 18, 2015. Defense was Lewis's strong point, recording a .994 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. He committed only 16 errors in 2836 total chances in 9483 innings in the outfield.  Post- baseball  Darren Lewis was an assistant baseball coach for California State University, East Bay. He left the position in 2016.

They can lay up to 400 eggs in a single summer. These eggs often hatch within just 3.5-5 weeks. This is a highly invasive slug species. It is often considered a pest, not only in areas where it has been accidentally introduced, but even in places where it is indigenous.

The colour of the Spanish slug is brownish or reddish brown, or brightly orange. The tentacles are darker. Colouration varies, but not within the same population. Adults differ little from Arion rufus, in contrast to the brightly coloured and banded juveniles that allow reliable determination of this species. Reproductive system: The atrium is small. The oviduct is large and swollen, with the same diameter as atrium. The spermatheca is spherical, its diameter twice of oviduct. The long, anteriorly swollen oviductus with large longitudinal ligula inside is distinctive of Arion vulgaris. When disturbed, the slugs will emit copious amounts of mucus. When killed in boiling water (one of several methods used in the fight against the species as an invasive organism), the mucus will colour the water yellow. {Reproductive system of Arion vulgaris is important for species identification. leftthumbReproductive system of Arion vulgaris showing small and short atrium (A), and the long, muscular distal part of the oviduct (O). E – epiphallus; VD – vas deferens; B – bursa copulatrix. Reproductive system of Arion vulgaris showing long folds (ligula) inside the oviduct. }  Ecology  Arion vulgaris inhabits cultivated habitats of any kind, as well as natural habitats such as river and lake margins, margins of forests, forests in valleys or moderately dry meadows. In Switzerland it has been found up to 1700 m altitude. It is a serious horticultural pest in large parts of Europe. It is being dispersed mainly by soil used for horticultural purposes. Hedgehogs and some birds, including many breeds of domestic ducks, feed on slugs, often voraciously enough to control their numbers effectively. Some amphibians and reptiles do so too. Large species of ground beetles and species of glowworm in the family Lampyridae feed on slugs, snails and their eggs. The Spanish slug does not appear to be subject to such constraints, and locally appears in extremely dense populations. As an invasive species conspecific.

Arion vulgaris is the worst slug pest in Europe and it has an important economical, ecological, health and social impact. The local name of the slug in the regions it has invaded is typically a translation of \\"Spanish slug\\". In recent years, as its dominance has increased, it has been nicknamed \\"killer slug\\", perhaps due to its tendency to eat dead or weaker individuals of the species, although its destructive impact on gardens may seem just as appropriate a reason for the name. The German name \\"Spanische Wegschnecke\\" for the species translates \\"Spanish road slug\\", which could be misunderstood to indicate spread along roadside vegetation. \\"Wegschnecke\\" is the German artificial name invented for the genus Arion, so all members of the genus carry this name. The main reason behind problematic invasions of gardens by the Spanish slug is that it has adapted to a dry climate, where most eggs will dry out before hatching. The slug lays hundreds of eggs so that at least some may hatch. In the less dry regions of Northern Europe and Britain, the constraints of drought do not limit reproduction to the same degree. The species is also gregarious, allowing for mass occurrences. Like all pulmonate snails and slugs, it is a hermaphrodite and has the capacity to self-fertilize, meaning that one single slug can start an infestation. Poor control of exported produce has also been assumed to be a cause, as the main route for the slugs to spread was long time thought to have been through careless handling of imported produce from Spain and Portugal. In recent years, it has been observed that the Spanish slug has bred with the indigenous black slug Arion ater to produce a more frost- resistant variety in the more northerly regions.symposium at Canterbury Christ Church University College, Kent, UK, on 8-9 September 2003 from Malacological Society of London Danish authorities maintain that the Spanish slug, black slug and red slug are in fact subspecies of the same species. Engelke S. (2006?). \\"Til Snegleforeningen (Note to the Danish Slug-society)\\". Article in Danish Confusion over species The Spanish slug was identified as Arion lusitanicus when it was first reported as an invading species in France in 1956. Van Regteren Altena C.O. (1956). \\"Notes sur les limaces, 3. (in cooperation with D. Aten & A. R. Schouten). Sur la présence en France d’Arion lusitanicus Mabille\\". Journal de Conchyliologie 95: 89-99. This was most probably a case of misidentification. In slugs it is often difficult to establish good criteria for identifying species using external features or internal features, as colouration can be quite variable, and the rather plastic anatomy makes diagnostic anatomical features difficult to establish. Current consensus is that the true Arion lusitanicus is a microendemic species of the Serra da Arrábida mountains south of Lisbon, Portugal.Castillejo J. (1997). \\"Las babosas de la familia Arionidae Gray, 1840 en la Península Ibérica e Islas Baleares. Morfología y distribución. (Gastropoda, Pulmonata, terrestria nuda)\\". Revista, Real Academia Galega de Ciencias 16: 51-118. Santiago de Compostela. A close analysis of slugs from the site in Portugal from where it was originally described by Jules François Mabille in 1868, showed that the true A. lusitanicus differed from the central European invader in its internal anatomy, the shape of the spermatophore and the number of chromosomes. Castillejo J. (1997). Babosas del Noroeste Ibérico. Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Spain, 192 pp. The invader was identified in 1997 as Arion vulgaris, which had been described by Alfred Moquin-Tandon in 1855 from an unrecorded site in France, presumably from western or southwestern France. The results of these studies were first published in a local journal in Spain. The news were not noticed outside Spain until they were mentioned in a widely dispersed atlas of British molluscs. Still today we are confronted with the Central European invader being reported as having originally been introduced with vegetables from Spain. These reports are usually based on outdated information published in pre-1999 literature. Often this can be recognised by the name A. lusitanicus being used for the species, instead of A. vulgaris. Its common name \\"Spanish slug\\" was also based on the unsubstantiated assumption that the species would not only live in Portugal, but also in Spain. Portugal had less intensive economical trade connections with France. Actually Arion lusitanicus had never been reliably reported from Spain.

at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, Cambridge University. He is known for his studies on the early use of iron in India and the archaeology of Eastern India. Career Dilip K Chakrabarti is the first person to hold professorship in the field of ancient Indian history at Cambridge University. He started his career as a lecturer of Archaeology at Calcutta University from 1965 to 1977. He was a reader of Archaeology at Delhi University from 1977 to 1990 and also held a tenured appointment at Visva Bharati University from 1980 to 1981. He moved to a teaching post in South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University in 1990 and was promoted to professor prior to his retirement in 2008. He has also held visiting fellowships, scholarships, teaching appointments and received grants in Cambridge, Edinburgh, Tehran, New York, Paris, Jahangir Nagar (Bangladesh) and Armidale (Australia). He has archaeologically surveyed the Kangra valley, the whole of the Chhotanagpur plateau, the whole of the Ganga-Yamuna plain and Haryana-Panjab between 1980 and 2008. During this period he also worked out in the field the archaeology of the routes which linked the Ganga plain with the Deccan and the ancient routes of the Deccan and the southern Peninsula. After his retirement in 2008 he completed a spell of field-studies in Rajasthan. In 1963-79 he participated in archaeological field-projects in India and Iran. On these field-topics and other problems of Indian archaeology, he has authored (co-authored in two cases) 29 books (one in press) and edited/co-edited about a dozen more. He is presently Distinguished Fellow at the Delhi-based think tank, Vivekananda International Foundation, where he is also the Editor of the eleven-volume VIF series History of Ancient India. The publication of his 1984 book \\"The Antiquities of Kangra\\", where he was a co-author with Syed Jamal Hasan created a controversy when it was discovered that this book reproduced verbatim the M. Phil thesis of his student and co-author Syed Jamal Hasan. A 1985 committee of inquiry found in its report \\"The charge of plagiarism against Dr. Dilip Chakrabarti is unfounded. … Dr. Chakrabarti’s failure to mention in the preface to the book that the book is substantially the same as Mr. Hasan’s M.Phil thesis submitted to the University of Delhi is a serious impropriety.\\" Dr. Dilip Chakrabarti has strived to bring academic rigor into the Indian history research. He \\"lambasted\\" the Indian Council of Historical Research for inviting “vedic teacher” David Frawley to deliver the Foundation Day lecture. Chakrabarti said, \\"David Frawley is not an academic. Why should he be invited to deliver an academic lecture?' \\"It’s a fact there is a long shadow of the Left on history writing in India. But we need to correct that through proper academic research. We cannot achieve that with the likes of Mr. Frawley.\\" Chakrabarti argues 'that South Asian archaeology need not mimic the developments in the Euro-American World, but rather it should be attentive to its own needs'.

The violent confrontation occurred near the small Francophone hamlet of Reesor Siding (a ghost town today), that is located just west of Opasatika, approximately halfway between Kapuskasing and Hearst in Northern Ontario. Background Fifteen hundred members of the Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union, Local 2995 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, walked out on strike on January 14, 1963, effectively halting operations at the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company which relied on their logs for wood pulp. Among the complaints of the woodcutters were a proposed wage freeze and a proposal by the company that would have seen the woodcutters working seven days a week over the next two months to meet quota. Independent local farmer-settlers were also established suppliers of pulp wood to the mill, supplying approximately 25% of the company's annual needs. When they were asked to halt their own sales to put further pressure on the mill, however, the farmers refused. Combined with a separate strike at The New York Times, one of the chief consumers of the mill's pulp, this weakened the bargaining position of the woodcutters. Union members began sabotaging the farmers' stacked piles of lumber, making it unsaleable. The farmers' refusal to support the strike, and the tactics of the strikers soured relationships with the community. The situation deteriorated to the point that on January 23, the mayor of Kapuskasing, Norman Grant, was quoted in The Globe and Mail: \\"These settlers are getting so desperate they are going to go into the bush with guns and shoot anyone who tries to interfere with their cutting.\\"CBC Digital Archives, \\"Bitter bush strike turns deadly,\\" Feb. 17, 1963. Confrontation On February 10, a shipment of 600 cords (2200 m³) was scheduled to be loaded onto waiting railcars at midnight, and a mob of 400 unarmed union members had resolved to disrupt the shipment. Between 12 and 20 Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officers waited at the loading station where twenty farmers were on hand to protect the lumber. The police erected a simple line made from chains in an attempt to protect the shipment and keep the two groups apart. However, the union members breached the small police cordon.50 Years later: The Reesor Siding incident,\\" Feb. 17, 1963. As the union members continued toward the stockpiled pulp wood, a number of the farmers stepped out from the concealment of a hut by the tracks and began shooting before the union members reached the chain. Eleven union members were shot: Fernand Drouin, and brothers Irenée and Joseph Fortier were killed; eight others were wounded: Harry Bernard, Ovila Bernard, Joseph Boily, Alex Hachey, Albert Martel, Joseph Mercier, Léo Ouimette and Daniel Tremblay. Later, Donald MacDonald, leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP), would declare that affidavits indicated the police knew that the farmers had brought firearms with them that night, but had not taken any precautions to ensure that they were not used. Resolution Following the deadly confrontation, an additional 200 OPP officers were sent to the scene. The Provincial Ministry of Labour quickly intervened to settle the labour dispute. The striking workers voted to return to work under the terms of their old contract on February 17 while arbitration to fully resolve the issues behind the 33-day-long strike continued. Legal proceedings All twenty farmers present the night of the shootings were charged, and 5 .22 rifles, 3 12 gauge shotguns, 2 .30-30 rifles, 2 Lee–Enfield rifles, a .30-06 rifle and a .38 Smith & Wesson revolver were confiscated. A total of 237 union members were charged with rioting and held temporarily in the former Monteith POW Camp, south of Iroquois Falls, until they were released on bail posted by the union. Eventually, 138 union members were found guilty of illegal assembly and the union paid $27,600 in fines. The case against the farmers was heard in October 1963 in Cochrane, before Supreme Court of Ontario Chief Justice McRuer. After three days of deliberations following a preliminary hearing the seven-man jury dismissed the charges of non-capital murder. Paul-Emile Coulombe, Léonce Tremblay, and Héribert Murray were charged with firearms violations arising from the incident, which resulted in fines of $150 to each of them. Cultural significance A memorial to the incident and the dead and injured workers was erected by the union, amid some public outcry, at a cost of $22,000. The Globe and Mail reported threats at the time to destroy the monument. The Province of Ontario in turn erected a historical plaque on the site, which is located at . In 1969, Stompin Tom Connors released his album On Tragedy Trail, which chronicled various real and fictitious Canadian tragedies, including the Reesor shooting. He reported receiving death threats, ordering him not to play the song at upcoming venues. The incident has been the subject of a number of folks songs, plays, and a CBC radio documentary in Quebec. It also forms the basis for the 2003 historical novel Défenses legitimes by Doric Germain. In 2005, Brent St. Denis marked the 42nd anniversary of the confrontation in Parliament, and it has also been occasionally raised in the course of the business of the Ontario Legislature as an important milestone in labour history.

Early life  The son of Sir John Skelton KCB LLD, Skelton was born on 1 July 1880 at Hermitage of Braid in Edinburgh and was educated at Glenalmond College, the University of Edinburgh and at Christ Church, Oxford, to which he won a history scholarship. He was placed in the Second Class in the School of Modern History in 1902 and in 1906 he was called to the Scottish Bar and therefore joined the Faculty of Advocates. Skelton was respected as a lawyer, but he dealt mainly with divorce cases and those involving disputed wills. In 1920, he was appointed Junior Counsel to the Post Office and to the Board of Inland Revenue in 1921. In the First World War, Skelton served with the Scottish Horse as a Lieutenant, Captain and latterly a Major in Gallipoli, Salonika and France, where he was seriously wounded in the last weeks of the war.  Political career  Skelton first stood for Parliament at the second general election of 1910, but he lost the East Perthshire Division to his Liberal opponent. Despite his defeat, Skelton remained active in politics, speaking frequently from Unionist platforms across Scotland. He was opposed to Irish Home Rule, but he was more progressive on issues like land reform, industrial relations and the use of the referendum. At the end of the Great War, Skelton stood aside and allowed the Coalition candidate in East Perthshire to be elected unopposed. However, he was elected Member of Parliament for the new Perth Division in 1922, although he lost the constituency a year later to a Liberal.  Constructive conservatism  Skelton was a talented journalist and wrote frequently for The Spectator, including four articles in April and May 1923 under the heading \\"Constructive Conservatism\\". These lively articles set out his political philosophy—chiefly the pursuit of a property-owning democracy, the division of land into small-holdings, co-partnership and share options to improve industrial relations and finally the use of referendums to resolve disputes between the House of Commons and House of Lords—as well as urge the Unionists to compete with Labour on more typically socialist issues like pensions and housing. The four Spectator articles were republished as a pamphlet in 1924 which had a lasting influence, particularly among younger Tory MPs.  YMCA  Skelton was re-elected for Perth in 1924 and again in 1929. He quickly struck up friendships with the Conservative MPs like Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan, Robert Boothby, John Buchan and Oliver Stanley and became the intellectual leader of a Parliamentary grouping dubbed the YMCA by cynical older Parliamentarians. The group lobbied to make sure that Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin resisted the influence of reactionary elements in the Conservative Party and instead implemented progressive legislation. Baldwin was sympathetic and it was soundings with the YMCA which prevented Baldwin backing a controversial Political Levy Bill which would have had disastrous consequences for United Kingdom trade union relations. Skelton also maintained the group's journalistic presence, writing several articles for The Spectator, the Quarterly Review and the English Review.  Scottish Office  Memorial to Archibald Noel Skelton, old churchyard, Loch Leven, Kinross Skelton switched to the Scottish Universities constituency in 1931 and was returned unopposed. That same year, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland with responsibility for health, housing and education. He was a talented administrator but occasionally pedantic when intervening in Commons debates. By 1935, Skelton was terminally ill with cancer and after several weeks in a nursing home died in Edinburgh on 22 November 1935. The declaration for the Scottish Universities constituency was made three days later and Skelton was re-elected posthumously. Skelton was cremated and his ashes were buried in Dean Cemetery with his sister. A separate memorial lies in the old churchyard in Kinross on the edge of Loch Leven.  Influence  Although Skelton died at the relatively young age of 55, he had once been seen as a potential Conservative leader and certainly as a senior Cabinet minister. Although he was quickly forgotten among the wider public, his influence, as Harold Macmillan wrote in his memoirs, \\"on politics and political thinking must have grown steadily year by year\\". His thinking on property ownership as the fundamental basis of modern conservatism proved particularly attractive and Anthony Eden personally revived the phrase as a political slogan at the 1946 Conservative Party conference. Macmillan then used it as the intellectual basis for the 1950s house-building boom while his successor as Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home owed his early political career to Skelton as his PPS from 1931–1935.

Club career Born in Bradford, Armstrong served in the RAF during the Second World War. He was a versatile, tough-tackling and energetic midfielder who played mainly for Chelsea, joining the club from Bradford Rovers in 1946 for a fee of 100 guineas. Armstrong was a key member of Ted Drake's 1954–55 Championship-winning Chelsea side, making 39 appearances that season. He played in over 400 games (including a then-club record 362 league games) for the West London club and scored 30 goals. After leaving Chelsea in 1957 Armstrong emigrated to Gisborne, New Zealand and continued to play football there for several local clubs, including Eastern Suburbs and North Shore United, and won four Chatham Cups. He then took over as manager at Mount Wellington, winning two league titles (in 1972 and 1974) and another Chatham Cup, in 1973. He played his last game in 1971, aged almost 47. Armstrong was later appointed chief coach of the national side. International career Armstrong was a member of England's 1954 World Cup squad but did not travel to Switzerland, remaining in England as one of five players on reserve status. He won a solitary England cap, against Scotland at Wembley in England's famous 7–2 win in the British Home Championship in April 1955. After emigrating to New Zealand in 1957, Armstrong played a significant part in developing football in his adopted country and played 13 times for the national side, including nine A-internationals in which he scored three goals. In 1991, he was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Soccer Media Association Hall of Fame. Management career Armstrong managed National League side Mount Wellington, and was player manager of the New Zealand national soccer team from 1958 to 1964, taking charge of 32 games in that period, winning 11, losing 19 and drawing two.All Whites Coaching Records In 1980, he took charge of the New Zealand women's national soccer team.Football Ferns Roll of Honour Family Armstrong's family is well represented in international football.

The band featured lead singer Terry Cashman, best known for his baseball songs, notably \\"Talkin' Baseball\\", then known as Dennis Minogue. The group disbanded when John \\"Marty\\" Trautman, co-founder of the group, was drafted by the U.S. Army on December 11, 1962. The Chevrons formed in the Inwood Section of upper Manhattan in 1958. The group consisted of tenor lead singer Dennis Minogue (Cashman), lead baritone/baritone John \\"Marty\\" Trautman, second tenor Gary Giordan, first tenor Frank Williams, and bass, Raul Al Conde. Conde was formerly a member of The Spirals from Washington Heights, New York, who recorded \\"Little Girl\\" and \\"School Bells\\" c. 1958 for George Goldner's End Record Label. The Chevrons' first recording on Bob Shad's Brent label was \\"That Comes With Love\\" b/w \\"Don't Be Heartless\\", followed by \\"Lullabye\\" b/w \\"Day After Forever\\". The success of \\"Lullabye\\" landed them an appearance on Dick Clark's American Bandstand on June 24, 1960. \\"Lullabye\\" was followed by an album on Time Records called Sing-Along Rock N' Roll, which consisted of covers of twenty-six hit songs arranged in sing-a-long format. Several songs - including \\"Little Star\\", \\"Come Go With Me\\" and \\"Little Darlin'\\" - were released off the album as singles. Marty Trautman Sister Marion Trautman worked at an Advertising Company as Creative Producer in 1960 she got the Chevrons to do a TV commercial for one of the companies clients, as a Barbershop Quartet, for a Hair Tonic Product called (Dandy Hair Tonic) which was shown on National Television CBS which was one of the sponsored Commercials for The Million Dollar Movie at the time. When The Chevrons disbanded, Conde went on to form another group called The Holidays (c. 1961), recording two songs he had written for the group,\\"New Orleans\\" and \\"Life\\" on the Sabina label, owned and produced by The Belmonts. In 1967, Dennis Minogue aka Terry Cashman teamed up with Gene Pistilli and Tommy West on Paramount Records to form the pop-folk group Cashman, Pistilli and West. Their successful debut album, Bound to Happen (1967) included the Cashman and Pistilli composition \\"Sunday Will Never Be the Same\\", a summer 1967 hit for Spanky and Our Gang. Cashman and West later recorded the album Tale of Two Cities (American City Suite) on Dunhill records, and produced several hits for Jim Croce. Terry Cashman was honored at the Baseball Hall Of Fame for his song \\"Talkin' Baseball\\" (Willie, Mickey and the Duke) on July 23, 2011. The Chevrons reunited in July 1988, to appear as guests on the \\"Doo-Wop Shop\\" hosted by Don K. Reed Show on WCBS-FM. In 1999, The Wop Ding A Ling collection of New York doo-wop from the late 1950s and 1960s included \\"Lullabye\\" and \\"Don't Be Heartless\\". On December 25, 2011, co-founder John \\"Marty\\" Trautman (Johnny '56) died at his home in Coppell, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. His final professional singing gig was earlier that month. Raul (Al) Conde contributed a short story written about his real-life experiences growing up as a kid in Washington Heights NYC during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s to Heightsmemories.com. Boris Riabov, a documentary filmmaker, happened to read the essay and asked Al Conde if he could make a short documentary based on his true life story. The documentary was made and it is called (Through A Kids Eyes) Part 1, Part 2 Which can be watched on YouTube.com.

Distribution Arion lusitanicus is native to woody areas in Portugal. Description In slugs it is often difficult to establish good criteria for identifying species using external features or internal features, as colouration can be quite variable, and the rather plastic anatomy makes diagnostic anatomical features difficult to establish. It is a rather large (up to 80 mm long) slug of reddish-brown colour. There are two light brown bands on the dorsum and mantle, the right band passes above the pneumostome. The margin of the foot is reddish or yellowish with dark transverse lines reaching into the lateral parts of the sole. The sole is olive greyish with darker marginal zones. The tentacles are blackish. Genitalia: Atrium spherical and undivided, spermatheca ovoid, spermatheca duct as long as spermatheca or slightly shorter, getting slightly wider near insertion at atrium, epiphallus longer than vas deferens, vagina longer and wider than spermatheca duct.Animalbase (Welter-Schultes) Taxonomy The more well known Spanish slug Arion vulgaris (Moquin-Tandon, 1855) was for a time misidentified as Arion lusitanicus, but the two slugs are not very closely related, differing in internal anatomy, shape of spermatophore and number of chromosomes.

The precise definition of a singular point depends on the type of curve being studied. Algebraic curves in the plane Algebraic curves in the plane may be defined as the set of points (x, y) satisfying an equation of the form f(x, y)=0, where f is a polynomial function f:R2→R. If f is expanded as :f=a_0+b_0x+b_1y+c_0x^2+2c_1xy+c_2y^2+\\\\dots\\\\, If the origin (0, 0) is on the curve then a0=0. If b1≠0 then the implicit function theorem guarantees there is a smooth function h so that the curve has the form y=h(x) near the origin. Similarly, if b0≠0 then there is a smooth function k so that the curve has the form x=k(y) near the origin. In either case, there is a smooth map from R to the plane which defines the curve in the neighborhood of the origin. Note that at the origin :b_0={\\\\partial f\\\\over\\\\partial x},\\\\,b_1={\\\\partial f\\\\over\\\\partial y}, so the curve is non-singular or regular at the origin if at least one of the partial derivatives of f is non-zero. The singular points are those points on the curve where both partial derivatives vanish, :f(x,y)={\\\\partial f\\\\over\\\\partial x}={\\\\partial f\\\\over\\\\partial y}=0. Regular points Assume the curve passes through the origin and write y=mx. Then f can be written :f=(b_0+mb_1)x+(c_0+2mc_1+c_2m^2)x^2+\\\\dots.\\\\, If b0+mb1 is not 0 then f=0 has a solution of multiplicity 1 at x=0 and the origin is a point of single contact with line y=mx. If b0+mb1=0 then f=0 has a solution of multiplicity 2 or higher and the line y=mx, or b0x+b1y=0, is tangent to the curve. In this case, if c0+2mc1+c2m2 is not 0 then the curve has a point of double contact with y=mx. If the coefficient of x2, c0+2mc1+c2m2, is 0 but the coefficient of x3 is not then the origin is a point of inflection of the curve. If the coefficients of x2 and x3 are both 0 then the origin is called point of undulation of the curve. This analysis can be applied to any point on the curve by translating the coordinate axes so that the origin is at the given point.Hilton Chapter II §1 Double points Three limaçons illustrating the types of double point. When converted to Cartesian coordinates as (x^2+y^2-x)^2=(1.5)^2(x^2+y^2), the left curve acquires an acnode at the origin, which is an isolated point in the plane. The central curve, the cardioid, has a cusp at the origin. The right curve has a crunode at the origin and the curve crosses itself to form a loop. If b0 and b1 are both 0 in the above expansion, but at least one of c0, c1, c2 is not 0 then the origin is called a double point of the curve. Again putting y=mx, f can be written :f=(c_0+2mc_1+c_2m^2)x^2+(d_0+3md_1+3m^2d_2+d_3m^3)x^3+\\\\dots.\\\\, Double points can be classified according to the solutions of c0+2mc1+m2c2=0. =Crunodes= If c0+2mc1+m2c2=0 has two real solutions for m, that is if c0c2−c12<0, then the origin is called a crunode. The curve in this case crosses itself at the origin and has two distinct tangents corresponding to the two solutions of c0+2mc1+m2c2=0. The function f has a saddle point at the origin in this case. =Acnodes= If c0+2mc1+m2c2=0 has no real solutions for m, that is if c0c2−c12>0, then the origin is called an acnode. In the real plane the origin is an isolated point on the curve; however when considered as a complex curve the origin is not isolated and has two imaginary tangents corresponding to the two complex solutions of c0+2mc1+m2c2=0. The function f has a local extremum at the origin in this case. =Cusps= If c0+2mc1+m2c2=0 has a single solution of multiplicity 2 for m, that is if c0c2−c12=0, then the origin is called a cusp. The curve in this case changes direction at the origin creating a sharp point. The curve has a single tangent at the origin which may be considered as two coincident tangents. =Further classification= The term node is used to indicate either a crunode or an acnode, in other words a double point which is not a cusp. The number of nodes and the number of cusps on a curve are two of the invariants used in the Plücker formulas. If one of the solutions of c0+2mc1+m2c2=0 is also a solution of d0+3md1+3m2d2+m3d3=0 then the corresponding branch of the curve has a point of inflection at the origin. In this case the origin is called a flecnode. If both tangents have this property, so c0+2mc1+m2c2 is a factor of d0+3md1+3m2d2+m3d3, then the origin is called a biflecnode.Hilton Chapter II §2 Multiple points A curve with a triple point at the origin: x(t)=\\\\sin 2t+\\\\cos t,\\\\quad y(t)= \\\\sin t+\\\\cos 2t In general, if all the terms of degree less than k are 0, and at least one term of degree k is not 0 in f, then curve is said to have a multiple point of order k or a k-ple point. The curve will have, in general, k tangents at the origin though some of these tangents may be imaginary.Hilton Chapter II §3 Parametric curves A parameterized curve in R2 is defined as the image of a function g:R→R2, g(t) = (g1(t),g2(t)). The singular points are those points where : {dg_1\\\\over dt}={dg_2\\\\over dt}=0. A cusp in the semicubical parabola y^2=x^3 Many curves can be defined in either fashion, but the two definitions may not agree. For example, the cusp can be defined on an algebraic curve, x3−y2 = 0, or on a parametrised curve, g(t) = (t2,t3). Both definitions give a singular point at the origin. However, a node such as that of y2−x3−x2 = 0 at the origin is a singularity of the curve considered as an algebraic curve, but if we parameterize it as g(t) = (t2−1,t(t2−1)), then g′(t) never vanishes, and hence the node is not a singularity of the parameterized curve as defined above. Care needs to be taken when choosing a parameterization. For instance the straight line y = 0 can be parameterised by g(t) = (t3,0) which has a singularity at the origin. When parametrised by g(t) = (t,0) it is nonsingular. Hence, it is technically more correct to discuss singular points of a smooth mapping rather than a singular point of a curve. The above definitions can be extended to cover implicit curves which are defined as the zero set f −1(0) of a smooth function, and it is not necessary just to consider algebraic varieties. The definitions can be extended to cover curves in higher dimensions. A theorem of Hassler Whitney Th. Bröcker, Differentiable Germs and Catastrophes, London Mathematical Society. Lecture Notes 17. Cambridge, (1975)Bruce and Giblin, Curves and singularities, (1984, 1992) , (paperback) states :Theorem. Any closed set in Rn occurs as the solution set of f −1(0) for some smooth function f:Rn→R. Any parameterized curve can also be defined as an implicit curve, and the classification of singular points of curves can be studied as a classification of singular point of an algebraic variety. Types of singular points Some of the possible singularities are: *An isolated point: x2+y2 = 0, an acnode *Two lines crossing: x2−y2 = 0, a crunode *A cusp: x3−y2 = 0, also called a spinode * A tacnode: x4−y2 = 0 *A rhamphoid cusp: x5−y2 = 0.

The film footage of the sighting is believed to be among the first ever taken of what came to be called an unidentified flying object. The footage was investigated by the U.S. Air Force, and found to be reflections from two F-94 jet fighters. The incident At 11:25 am on August 15, 1950, Nick Mariana, the general manager of the Great Falls Electrics minor-league baseball team, and his nineteen-year-old secretary, Virginia Raunig, were inspecting the empty Legion Stadium baseball field before a game.(Ruppelt, p. 219) The Electrics were a farm club of the Brooklyn Dodgers. A bright flash caught Mariana's eye and, according to his reports, he saw two bright silvery objects, rotating while flying over Great Falls at a speed he estimated to be two hundred to four hundred miles per hour. He believed that they were roughly fifty feet wide and one hundred and fifty feet apart.(Ruppelt, 219) Mariana ran to his car to retrieve his 16 mm movie camera and filmed the UFOs for sixteen seconds. The camera could film the objects in color, but could not record sound. Raunig also witnessed the objects.(Ruppelt, 219) The day after Mariana's sighting, the Great Falls Tribune, the city's daily newspaper, described his sighting and the film in an article, which was picked up by other media outlets around the nation. For several weeks after the sighting, Mariana showed his film to local community groups, including the Central Roundtable Athletic Club.(Clark, p. 397) Air Force investigation After seeing the film, a reporter for the Great Falls Tribune called Wright- Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and informed them of Mariana's sighting and film. U.S. Air Force Captain John P. Brynildsen interviewed Mariana at nearby Malmstrom AFB outside of Great Falls. When Mariana and Ms. Raunig both told him that they had seen two jet fighters pass over the baseball stadium shortly after the sighting, Brynildsen felt that perhaps the jets were the objects Mariana had seen and captured on film.(Clark, 398) With Mariana's permission, Capt. Brynildsen sent the film to Wright-Patterson AFB for analysis. He told a reporter in Great Falls that he had \\"picked up about eight feet of film from Mariana.\\" However, in his message to Wright-Patterson he said that he was sending \\"approximately fifteen feet of moving picture film\\" to the base for study.Project Blue Book, August 1950 Great Falls Montana, pgs. 12-13 According to UFO historian Jerome Clark, this discrepancy was never cleared up.(Clark, 398) At Wright-Patterson AFB the film was briefly examined and determined to be the reflections from two F-94 jet fighters that were known to be flying over Great Falls at the time of Mariana's sighting. Lt. Col. Ray W. Taylor returned the film to Mariana with a cover letter stating that \\"our photoanalysts were unable to find anything identifiable of an unusual nature\\".(Clark, 398) However, according to Air Force officer Edward J. Ruppelt, who would become the supervisor of the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation into the UFO mystery in 1951, \\"in 1950 there was no interest [by the Air Force] in the UFO, so after a quick viewing, Project Grudge had written them off as the reflections from two F-94 jet fighters that were in the area\\".(Ruppelt, 219) Controversy soon arose when Mariana claimed that the first thirty-five frames of his film - which he said most clearly showed the UFOs as rotating disks - were missing. People in the Great Falls area who had viewed Mariana's film supported his claims.(Clark, 398) They claimed that the missing frames clearly showed the UFOs as spinning, metallic disks with a \\"notch or band\\" along their outer edges. The Air Force personnel denied this accusation, and insisted that they had removed only a single frame of film which was damaged in the analysis.(Clark, 398) Lawsuit In January 1951, Bob Considine, a writer and UFO skeptic, wrote an article for Cosmopolitan magazine. Entitled \\"The Disgraceful Flying Saucer Hoax\\", it debunked the most famous UFO sightings to that date, including Mariana's sighting and film. Claiming that Considine's article implied that he was \\"a liar, prankster, half-wit, crank, publicity hound and fanatic\\", Mariana filed a lawsuit for slander against Considine. The lawsuit was eventually dropped in September 1955.(Clark, 398)  Later studies  In July 1952, Captain Ruppelt was able to convince Mariana to let the Air Force see the film again for a more detailed analysis. Mariana reluctantly agreed, but only after requiring the Air Force to sign an agreement that they would not remove any frames of the film.(Ruppelt, 220) The film analysts at Wright-Patterson AFB concluded that the objects in Mariana's film were not \\"birds, balloons, or meteors\\".(Ruppelt, 220) The original conclusion - that the objects were reflections from the F-94 jets - was also ruled out. According to Ruppelt in his memoirs: \\"The two jets weren't anywhere close to where the two UFOs had been... we studied each individual light and both appeared too steady to be reflections. We drew a blank on the Montana Movie, it was an unknown\\".(Ruppelt, 220) In January 1953 the Air Force and CIA convened a committee of prominent scientists to examine the \\"best\\" cases collected by Project Blue Book. Called the Robertson Panel, after its chairman, physicist H.P. Robertson, it viewed Mariana's UFO film. The scientists judged that the objects in the film were \\"reflections of aircraft known to have been in the area\\".(Clark, 399) Baker analysis In 1954 Greene-Rouse productions decided to film a documentary-movie about the UFO phenomenon. They asked Nick Mariana for the rights to use his film in the documentary, and Mariana agreed. To analyze the film, they hired Robert M.L. Baker, Jr., a scientist and engineer for the Douglas Aircraft company. Baker completed his analysis of Mariana's film in early 1956. He concluded that the explanation that the objects were simply reflections from the F-94 jets was \\"quite strained\\".(Baker, 1956) In 1968 Baker testified before a Congressional hearing on UFOs. He commented on his analysis of the Mariana film: \\"Preliminary analysis excluded most natural phenomena. More detailed study indicated that the only remaining natural phenomenon candidate for the Utah film was birds in flight, and for the Montana film it was airplane fuselage reflections of the sun. After about 18 months of rather detailed, albeit not continuous, study using various film-measuring equipments [sic] at Douglas and at UCLA, as well as analysis of a photogrammetric experiment, it appeared that neither of these hypothesized natural phenomena explanations had merit\\".(Baker, Congressional testimony 1968) In 1969 Baker presented a paper at the AAAS UFO panel organized by Thornton Page and Carl Sagan. He discussed the Mariana film as well as other films and photographs of UFOs. Baker concluded that the Mariana film was unidentifiable. He emphasized the importance of improving the quality of photographic data before speculating about the nature of UFOs.(Baker, \\"Motion Pictures of UFOS's\\", 1969) Condon report In 1966 the U.S. government established and funded a study of the UFO phenomenon. Located at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and chaired by Dr. Edward U. Condon, a prominent physicist, the committee's researchers decided to \\"reinvestigate\\" Mariana's UFO film. The Condon Committee assigned two investigators to study the case: Dr. Roy Craig, a physicist who was generally skeptical of UFOs, and Dr. David Saunders, a psychologist who had long been interested in the Mariana UFO incident. Saunders and Craig soon added a new problem to the case - they were not sure whether the film had been taken on August 5 or August 15, 1950. After interviewing Mariana, the two researchers came to different conclusions about the film. Craig remained skeptical of Mariana's claims that 35 frames had been removed from the footage: \\"the comment I considered most significant, which Mr. Mariana's ex- secretary made to me during a telephone interview...when I pressed for information or beliefs regarding clipping of the film by the Air Force. The very hesitant comment was, 'What you have to remember in all this is... that Nick Mariana is a promoter'. That comment was adequate to close our conversation\\".(Craig, p. 230) In his memoirs, Dr. Craig also wrote that: \\"I would not like to have to defend Dr. Saunders's conviction that the Mariana film is strong evidence that we have extraterrestrial visitors\\".(Craig, p. 231) However, David Saunders thought the Mariana film was a crucial case in the Colorado Project's case files. Impressed by Baker's analysis, Saunders was suspicious of the discrepancy over the missing frames at the beginning of the Mariana film. He was particularly concerned with reports that the first three seconds of the film that were missing clearly indicated the objects were spinning discs.(Saunders, 1969) He came to the conclusion that Mariana's film \\"was the one sighting of all time that did more than any other single case to convince me that there is something to the UFO problem\\".(Clark, 400) Dr. William Hartmann, an astronomer for the University of Arizona, analyzed the Mariana UFO film for the Condon Report. His conclusion was that \\"past investigations have left airplanes as the principal working hypothesis. The data at hand indicate that while it strains credibility to suppose that these were airplanes, the possibility nonetheless cannot be entirely ruled out. There are several independent arguments against airplane reflections.\\".(Condon, 635)  Today  Copies of Mariana's film currently reside in the US National Archives.National Archives local identifier number 341-PBB-323A It is still featured in documentaries, television programs, and shared online. The film continues to be debated. Since Mariana's sighting, over 100 other UFO sightings have been made in Great Falls, Montana, making it one of the most active locations for UFO sightings in North America. In 2008, the minor-league baseball team in Great Falls was renamed the Great Falls Voyagers in honor of the Mariana UFO incident.

Design The Fireflite was introduced in 1955 as De Soto's flagship model. It was wider and longer than previous DeSoto models and it came equipped with a V8 engine producing 200 hp when equipped with the 4 barrel carburetor (190 kW) and PowerFlite automatic transmission. The transmission was operated by a Flite-Control lever located on the dashboard. The car weighed 4,070 lb (1850 kg) and cost US$3,544. AM radio was a $110 option. The 1956 model car was best known for its long, tapering tail fins, often accentuated by a two-tone exterior finish. The interior offered bench seating that could accommodate six passengers. The Fireflite had a 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 11 seconds and a top speed of 110 mph (175 km/h). Sales The Fireflite’s bold design increased sales for DeSoto. In 1955, DeSotos sold well with over 114,765 examples produced, making 1955 the best year for the company since 1946. By 1956, DeSoto placed eleventh in U.S. production with an annual production of 110,418 cars. The success was short-lived, however, and Chrysler Corporation discontinued the Fireflite models at the end of the 1960 model year, and the DeSoto brand effective in November 1960. Indianapolis 500 pace car In 1956 a gold and white Fireflite convertible was the Official Pace Car for the 1956 Indianapolis 500. While no official production figures for the pacesetter convertibles was ever released, research from National DeSoto Club members has narrowed it down to between 390-426 produced. Indianapolis 500 President Tony Hulman said the DeSoto was chosen unanimously by the track committee because it delivered outstanding performance and had superb handling characteristics.DeSoto Sets Pace At Indianapolis 500, Life Magazine, May 28, 1956, pg. 14. Modifications and specifications The 1956 Fireflite had a longer stroke, 3.80 inches, giving a 330 cubic inch displacement (5.4L). Compression ratio increased to 8.5:1 and power increased to .Ultimate American V8 Engine Databook, 1949 - 1974, Peter C. Sessler, MotorBooks International, 1999, pg. 147. It made up 27.39% of DeSoto's sales in 1956. Power seats were $70, while power brakes cost $40. The Fireflite’s appearance for 1957 was redesigned with the help of Chrysler Corporation's head stylist, Virgil Exner. The design was bold and radical with large tail fins, dual oval exhaust and triple-lens taillights. The tail fins were not only aesthetic, but helped to stabilize the car at high speeds. A four-headlight system was optional for both the Fireflite and DeSoto Firedome models in 1957.Kiplinger's Personal Finance, January 1957, pg. 21. The DeSoto Firesweep polyhead V8s were introduced with a bore and stroke of X . for 325 cid. The two barrel V8 was rated at while the four barrel version produced . The 330 cid hemi engine was replaced by a hemi which was 341 cid (5.6L) . The two barrel carburetor produced . while the four barrel version was rated at . Both engines had a 9.25:1 compression ratio. In 1957 the Fireflite was superseded by the Adventurer as the premium DeSoto model. Nevertheless, Fireflites continued to offer high-grade appointments in a full line of body styles. Also in 1957, a station wagon was added to the Fireflite's lineup. Back-up lights became standard. In 1958, a new engine was added. For 1959, the car was restyled. The electric clock became standard. A hand brake light was optional.

It has both prehistoric and historic remains. Topography Carningli (or Carn Ingli) is high. Close to the coast, it dominates the surrounding countryside. It is easy to climb but has a rocky summit and a steep scree slope on its southern and eastern flanks. It is a biological SSSI.  Carningli Hillfort  The summit features a large and prominent archeological site; one of the largest hillforts in west Wales. This hillfort, generally dated to the Iron Age and assumed to be from the first millennium BC. It covers an area of about 4 ha, and is about 400 m x 150 m in extent. The lower slopes of Carningli are covered with traces of Bronze Age settlement (Pearson 2001) and so some features of the hillfort may be even older. Although not one of the largest fortified sites in Wales, it is certainly one of the most complex, incorporating a series of substantial stone embankments, natural rock cliffs and scree slopes which may have been used as natural defences. Inside and outside the embankments are terraced enclosures, hut circles and rectangles. Approximately 25 hut circles are at the north east end of the site. On the other side are three enclosures separated by embankments. Beneath the scree slope on the eastern flank of the mountain are two further massive defensive embankments. The only plan is that of Hogg 1973 - it has been modified by Figgis, and again in recent research by Brian John. According to Hogg, there are signs that some of the defensive embankments and walls had been intentionally demolished, which he attributed as \\"evidence for systematic destruction by Roman invaders in the aftermath of the conquest of Wales\\". The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales noted in 2009 that \\"Such a dramatic interpretation, placing the Roman legions on the slopes of Carn-ingli in an attack on its inhabitants, might be questioned today\\". There are records of intermittent occupation of the site in the Age of the Saints, and as recently as the Middle Ages. No comprehensive excavations of the hillfort have been made. As with other upland defended sites, the economy of the tribe which inhabited Carningli was probably a pastoral one. The site is incredibly exposed, and it is quite possible that it was only seasonally inhabited. The site is referred to in the Cadw Guide to Ancient and Historic Wales (1992) by Sian Rees, and in NP Figgis's \\"Prehistoric Preseli\\" (2001). Map of Carningli hillfort by Brian John Sacred association According to legend Saint Brynach (a local saint) used to climb to the summit to find serenity, to pray and to \\"commune with the angels\\" in the 5th century. In some old texts and maps the mountain is called Carn Yengly or Carnengli, which are probably corruptions of Carn Engylau. Strictly, this would be translated as \\"the rocky summit of the angels.\\" However, this derivation of the name is not universally agreed.B G Charles, The Place-names of Pembrokeshire, NLW, 1992, , page 163 In literature Brian John's \\"Angel Mountain Saga\\" of eight volumes, recounts the life of Mistress Martha Morgan of Plas Ingli. These books were published between 2001 and 2012. The mountain is the heroine's personal sanctuary. Industry There was once a little \\"mountain railway\\" on Carningli, carrying broken stone from a small quarry down to a crushing plant on the Cilgwyn Road. Some railway sleepers can still be found in the turf, but otherwise the only traces remaining are the two stone pillars that supported a cable drum — a cable was used to control the descent of the loaded wagons as they rolled downhill, and then to pull the empty ones back up again. This little industry was abandoned before 1930.

While the Firesweep featured DeSoto's signature tailfins, the front clip (the front section, forward of the firewall) was based on the Dodge Coronet. The most telling feature was the headlight design, housed under heavily chromed lids typical of Dodge. Firesweep grilles were similar to those on other contemporary DeSoto models. The Firesweep could seat six passengers. It was available initially as a four-door sedan, four-door station wagon, two-door hardtop and four-door hardtop.John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars, 1946-1975, Revised 4th edition, Krause Publications, 2002, pages 318 to 322 A convertible was added for 1958. Depending on the body style, Firesweeps weighed between 3,660 and 3,980 lb (1,660 and 1,674 kg). The base price of the Firesweep (1957) was US$3,169 and it was offered in one and two-tone exterior finishes. Features included power steering, power brakes, dashboard clock, push-button radio and whitewall tires. File:De Soto Firesweep 1957 5900cc.jpg1957 DeSoto Firesweep 4 Door Sedan Production and sales The first year of the car’s production, 1957, was the best year for Firesweep sales. A decline in DeSoto quality and increasing market pressures led to the end of the Firesweep’s production at the end of the 1959 model year. During 1959 Firesweep cars carried only DeSoto external nameplates. For 1960, DeSoto automobiles came in two series, Fireflite and the Adventurer. The final Desoto model, lacking a series name, was offered for the 1961 model year. DeSoto production ended in November 1960. Engine specifications, transmission, options In 1957, the DeSoto Firesweep was powered by the Dodge \\"Poly\\" 325 V8 with a 2bbl Stromberg down draft carburetor. The 325 was basically a detuned polyspherical combustion chambered version of the Dodge \\"Red Ram\\" 325 Hemi. With the optional power-pack four-barrel V8, the 1957 Firesweep produced 260 hp at 4400 rpm. This represented an increase of fifteen horsepower over the two-barrel engine.1957 DeSoto, Standard Catalog of American Cars, 1946 - 1975, John Gunnell, Krause Publications, 1982, pp. 264 - 265. The 1958 Firesweep was fitted with a V8 and the 1959 model with a V8 The Firesweep was offered with three different transmissions as well, a two-speed PowerFlite, a three-speed TorqueFlite, or a three-speed column-shifted manual. The Firesweep was available with up to a three-color paint job (the body was a different color than the \\"sweep\\" on the side of the body, and the roof was a different color still). DeSoto offered a laundry list of options for the vehicle to include, but not limited to: clock, AM radio, rear speaker, air conditioning, carpeting, deluxe cloth seat inserts, dual rear antennae, deluxe interior lighting, stainless steel stone shields, power steering, and power brakes.The Standard Catalog of American Cars (1946 - 1975), John Gunnell, Kraus Publications, 1987.

A former Camp Hill prison guard, Banks shot 13 people to death on September 25, 1982 in Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania and Jenkins Township, including seven children – five being his own – their mothers, some of their relatives, and one bystander. His attorneys argued for the insanity defense, but, following a trial before jurors from Allegheny County and presided over by Luzerne County Common Pleas judge Patrick J. Toole Jr., Banks was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. On November 29, 1990, the Pennsylvania State Legislature barred further use of the electric chair amid debate that electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment; it approved execution by lethal injection. Banks's case was appealed and, on December 2, 2004, he received a stay of execution following a determination that he was incompetent for execution. On May 12, 2010, Luzerne County Common Pleas judge Joseph Augello declared Banks was incompetent to be executed, following a competency hearing held the previous month. Shooting spree On the night of September 24, 1982, Banks drank large quantities of straight gin and took prescription drugs at his home on Schoolhouse Lane in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The next morning on September 25, 1982, he used an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill eight people in his house, including three women in their 20s (all girlfriends and mothers of his children) and five children, four of them his. Two of the women were sisters. Banks dressed in military fatigues and went outside, where he saw 22-year-old Jimmy Olsen and 24-year-old Ray Hall, Jr, who were leaving a house across the street. He shot at them both, reportedly yelling that they \\"would not tell anyone about this,\\" before he fired. He hit both men, fatally wounding Hall; Olsen survived. Banks drove away. Banks went to Heather Highlands mobile home park, where his former girlfriend Sharon Mazzillo and their son Kissamayu lived, of whom he had been trying to gain custody. Banks forced his way in and shot Mazzillo. He then shot and killed his sleeping son. Banks killed Sharon’s mother, who was trying to call police, and Sharon's 7-year-old nephew, who were also in the home. Hiding in the closet was Sharon’s brother, whom Banks did not see. He was the only survivor and called police, identifying Banks as the shooter. When police examined the victims at the mobile home park, they made the connection to the shooting of Olsen and Hall, who had been discovered at Schoolhouse Lane. They next found Banks's victims in his house. Police began to search for Banks, who abandoned his car and carjacked another vehicle. After abandoning the stolen vehicle, Banks stopped in a grassy isolated area to rest and fell asleep. After Banks awoke, he visited his mother’s house (also in Wilkes-Barre.) He was said to confess his crimes to her. His mother called his home to check on his children and instead reached the police on scene, who tried to keep Banks on the phone. Banks hung up, rounded up more ammunition, and went to a vacated rental house. This is when a standoff between Banks and police began. The police brought his mother to their base to talk with Banks. They tried various tactics to get the murderer to surrender (including having a false news report played over WILK radio saying that the children were alive and needed blood to survive.) The police tried other tactics to draw Banks out of the house. Finally, Robert Brunson, a former co-worker of Banks, was able to talk him out after a 4 hour standoff. As of September 30, 1982, Banks was charged with 8 counts of murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, grand theft auto, armed robbery, and felonious theft. Banks was held without bail.

Perpetrator George Emil Banks was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on June 22, 1942, to John Mack, who was black, and Mary Yelland, who is white. His parents were not married. According to his attorneys at his later trial, he suffered severely from racism while he was growing up because of being mixed race.Associated Press, \\"Decades on death row: Now delusional, George Banks killed 13 people, including 5 of his children in 1982\\", PennLive, 29 September 2017, accessed 16 October 2015. In 1961 at the age of 19, after being discharged from the Army, Banks and some accomplices robbed a tavern, shooting and injuring the unarmed owner. He was sentenced to six to fifteen years in prison, which was extended when he briefly escaped in 1964; however, he was granted parole in 1969 and his sentence was commuted by then Governor Milton Shapp in 1974. After his release, he married Doris M. Banks, who is black, on August 23, 1969. They had two daughters together. The couple divorced in 1976. As noted by his attorney during his trial, Banks seemed to have been deeply affected by racial issues. After his divorce, he dated white women. By September 1982 he had broken up with girlfriend Sharon Mazillo, who had lived with him at one time, and they were disputing custody of their young son. He was living with three women in his house; they were mothers of four of his children, and one had another daughter living with her. Despite his criminal record for an armed offense, Banks had started working as a prison guard at Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, in 1980. In 1982 Banks had told coworkers at the prison that \\"the world would soon be consumed by a race war\\" and said he wanted \\"to prevent the five children he fathered with the four white girlfriends from [experiencing] the torment and agony of racism\\". He was put on \\"an extended leave of absence\\" the first week in September 1982 after a conflict with a supervisor and threatening suicide. The prison ordered Banks to be examined for mental health issues at a Harrisburg-area hospital. Aftermath On June 6, 1983, Bank's trial began at the Luzerne County Courthouse in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. Banks insisted on testifying. He said that he had only wounded some of the victims and police had killed them. Several scene witnesses, Banks family members, and Olsen testified. Olsen identified Banks as the person who shot him and left him for dead. Closing arguments took place on June 21, 1983. Banks' attorney argued that he was insane, but the jury found Banks guilty of 12 counts of first-degree murder, one count of third-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, and one count each of robbery, theft, and endangering the life of another person. On June 22, 1983, the jury recommended the death penalty. Banks was incarcerated in the maximum-security unit at Huntingdon until November 1985. His appeals reached the U.S. Supreme Court, but it refused to overturn his verdict. He was then sent to the Correctional Institute at Graterford, where he was housed in a contained housing unit. From 1987 to 2000, Banks's attorneys continued to appeal his case. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his attorneys' argument that he lacked the mental competency to be executed. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge twice signed a death warrant for Banks; however, both times federal appellate courts have stayed his execution. In 2001, 2006, and 2008 the court held hearings about the mental state of Banks in order to determine if he could be executed. He exhibited delusional behavior that caused the court to rule him incompetent for execution. During this period, various appeals were being heard by state and federal courts. In 2010, another hearing was held on his competency; his attorney said his mental state had deteriorated significantly since 1982. Judge Joseph M. Augello ruled that Banks was mentally incompetent for execution or to assist his attorneys in seeking clemency. He would continue to be held in a restricted housing unit at Graterford prison. As of September 2017 he was still on death row in Pennsylvania. He was later transferred to SCI-Phoenix in May 2018. Determined incompetent for execution During appeals of his case, Banks was examined more than once in competency hearings by the court to determine if he was competent for execution, and he has been found mentally incompetent on three occasions. In 2006 psychiatrists testified that he was \\"psychotic, delusional and irrational.\\"Emilie Lounsberry, \\"Mass murderer judged unfit for execution; George E. Banks, who killed 13 people in 1982, is \\"a very mentally sick man,\\" the judge said.\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, 28 February 2006 In May 2010, Luzerne County Common Pleas judge Joseph Augello held a new hearing and determined that Banks was mentally incompetent for execution or to assist his attorney in a clemency appeal. As of September 2017, he was held in a restricted housing unit at Graterford prison. He was relocated to SCI Phoenix following the 2018 closure of SCI Graterford.

Introduced as DeSoto's premium line of vehicles in 1953 and 1954, the Firedome also occupied the least expensive position in the model lineup during 1955 and 1956 model years before it was reclassified as a mid-range vehicle offered by DeSoto between 1957 and 1959. Topline series, 1952–54 The 1953 Firedome was introduced just prior to DeSoto's 25th Anniversary in 1953, and arrived as the new top series, displacing the Custom nameplate which was retired at the end of the 1952 model year. The entire De Soto model lineup was restyled and Firedome prices started at US$2,740. During the 1953 model year, approximately 64,211 examples were produced. The Firedome could seat six passengers. It was available as a 4-door sedan, 5-door station wagon, 2-door coupe and 2-door convertible. The AM radio was $85. The Firedome was powered by a Hemi V8 engine producing 160 hp (120 kW) and had a top speed of 100 mph (160 km/h). The car weighed 3,700 lb (1,700 kg) and had a 0–60 mph (100 km/h) time of 15.5 seconds. This was the first time that DeSoto offered an 8-cylinder engine in one of its models since 1931. By 1953, DeSoto's Firedome Hemi V-8 produced 170 horsepower.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpH8QtTNAuk Entry Level series 1955–56 1956 Desoto Firedome Sedan In 1955, Chrysler dropped its 6-cylinder DeSoto Powermaster series and added the topline Fireflite series, pushing the Firedome down to entry level status. Still, the Firedome was not a cheap offering, retaining its V8 engine, but increasing the 276 c.i. displacement to 291 c.i. with a larger bore,a power boost to 185 horsepower,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl7MDMCFwpE and coming with a host of features and interior upgrades that were lacking in the Powermaster series. While Powerflite 2-speed automatics were advertised as optional transmission equipment on the Firedome, officially the car was also offered with a 3-speed manual as standard equipment, although few were produced. In 1956,the Firedome V-8 got still another boost in horsepower, to 230 H.P., an increase of 45 horsepower over the previous year. https://www.allpar.com/mopar/hemi/oldhemi.html Midline series 1957–59 The series was again moved upmarket in the model offering when the 1957 DeSotos were introduced, with the new entry-level Dodge-based Firesweep.

Zero to 60 mph (100 km/h) now took just under eight seconds with a top speed of . However 1958 DeSoto's sales skidded by almost 60% from 1957's model year output, partially due to the economy and partially because of build issues with the 1957 models. In an attempt to attract buyers, Chrysler offered the 1959 DeSoto Firedome in 26 solid colors and 190 two-tone finishes. By the end of the 1959 model year, Chrysler was struggling to find buyers for its DeSoto automobiles. Despite the wide variety of models available, consumers shunned DeSoto automobiles as rumor circulated that Chrysler would phase out the marque. A padded dash was standard. Firedome production ended at the end of the 1959 model year. For the 1960 model year DeSoto offered two models, the Fireflite and the Adventurer. For model year 1961, a model named only \\"DeSoto\\" was sold as a two-door hardtop and four-door hardtop. The end of the DeSoto marque came on November 30, 1960, 48 days after the 1961 models were introduced, ending 32 years of production.

It was directed by Bernhard Wicki and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and Julien Derode, with the film's stars, Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn, as co-producers. The screenplay was by Ben Barzman, adapted by Maurice Valency from Friedrich Dürrenmatt's 1956 play Der Besuch der alten Dame (literally, The Visit of the Old Lady). Bergman and Quinn head a cast that includes Irina Demick, Paolo Stoppa, Hans Christian Blech, Romolo Valli, Valentina Cortese, Claude Dauphin, and Eduardo Ciannelli. Plot Karla (Claire in the play) Zachanassian (Ingrid Bergman), a fabulously wealthy woman, returns to a decaying village she had been forced to leave years earlier in disgrace. She had a child by Serge Miller (Anthony Quinn), who denied paternity. Her purpose in this \\"visit\\" is to make a deal with the inhabitants -- in exchange for a vast sum of money, she wants Miller killed. At first reluctant, they eventually accept the arrangement and Miller is condemned to death. At the last moment, Karla stops the execution and tells the citizens that they will have to live with the guilt of their murderous choice for the rest of their lives.

However, it is a study of the darker elements of human nature. The themes of the film, as with the play, are greed, revenge and corruption and the fact that money can buy anything, even justice. Power that comes from money can lead to hate, even murder and to the collapse of ordinary morality. Notes * In the stage play, the character of Serge Miller (called Alfred Ill in the original text of the drama) is killed at the end. In the film, the execution is halted. * Bergman and Quinn co-starred again six years later in the romantic melodrama A Walk in the Spring Rain (1970). Reception According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $6,100,000 in film rentals to break even and made $2,635,000, meaning it lost money.

About in diameter. The third flat from the left is standing on edge, showing the thickness. A λ/20 optical flat that has been coated with aluminum, making a first-surface mirror Two optical flats tested using 589 nm laser-light. At in diameter and thick, both surfaces are flat to within 1/10 of the wavelength of the light (58.9 nm), as indicated by the perfectly straight fringes. An optical flat is an optical-grade piece of glass lapped and polished to be extremely flat on one or both sides, usually within a few tens of nanometres (billionths of a meter). They are used with a monochromatic light to determine the flatness (surface accuracy) of other surfaces, whether optical, metallic, ceramic, or otherwise, by interference. When an optical flat is placed on another surface and illuminated, the light waves reflect off both the bottom surface of the flat and the surface it is resting on. This causes a phenomenon similar to thin-film interference. The reflected waves interfere, creating a pattern of interference fringes visible as light and dark bands. The spacing between the fringes is smaller where the gap is changing more rapidly, indicating a departure from flatness in one of the two surfaces. This is comparable to the contour lines one would find on a map. A flat surface is indicated by a pattern of straight, parallel fringes with equal spacing, while other patterns indicate uneven surfaces. Two adjacent fringes indicate a difference in elevation of one-half wavelength of the light used, so by counting the fringes, differences in elevation of the surface can be measured to better than one micrometre. Usually only one of the two surfaces of an optical flat is made flat to the specified tolerance, and this surface is indicated by an arrow on the edge of the glass. Optical flats are sometimes given an optical coating and used as precision mirrors or optical windows for special purposes, such as in a Fabry–Pérot interferometer or laser cavity. Optical flats have uses in spectrophotometry as well. Flatness testing astigmatic, with curvatures in two orthogonal directions. An optical flat test in which the angular size of the light source is too small. The interference fringes only show up in the reflection, so the light needs to appear larger than the flat. An optical flat is usually placed upon a flat surface to be tested. If the surface is clean and reflective enough, rainbow colored bands of interference fringes will form when the test piece is illuminated with white light. However, if a monochromatic light is used to illuminate the work piece, such as helium, low- pressure sodium, or a laser, then a series of dark and light interference fringes will form. These interference fringes determine the flatness of the work piece, relative to the optical flat, to within a fraction of the wavelength of the light. If both surfaces are perfectly the same flatness and parallel to each other, no interference fringes will form. However, there is usually some air trapped between the surfaces. If the surfaces are flat, but a tiny optical wedge of air exists between them, then straight, parallel interference fringes will form, indicating the angle of the wedge (i.e.: more, thinner fringes indicate a steeper wedge while fewer but wider fringes indicate less of a wedge). The shape of the fringes also indicate the shape of the test surface, because fringes with a bend, a contour, or rings indicate high and low points on the surface, such as rounded edges, hills or valleys, or convex and concave surfaces.Metrology & Measurement by Bewoor – McGraw-Hill 2009 Page 224–230 Preparation Both the optical flat and the surface to be tested need to be extremely clean. The tiniest bit of dust settling between the surfaces can ruin the results. Even the thickness of a streak or a fingerprint on the surfaces can be enough to change the width of the gap between them. Before the test, the surfaces are usually cleaned very thoroughly. Most commonly, acetone is used as the cleaning agent, because it dissolves most oils and it evaporates completely, leaving no residue. Typically, the surface will be cleaned using the \\"drag\\" method, in which a lint-free, scratch-free tissue is wetted, stretched, and dragged across the surface, pulling any impurities along with it. This process is usually performed dozens of times, ensuring that the surface is completely free of impurities. A new tissue will need to be used each time, to prevent recontamination of the surfaces from previously removed dust and oils. Testing is often done in a clean-room or another dust-free environment, keeping the dust from settling on the surfaces between cleaning and assembly. Sometimes, the surfaces may be assembled by sliding them together, helping to scrape off any dust that might happen to land on the flat. The testing is usually done in a temperature-controlled environment to prevent any distortions in the glass, and needs to be performed on a very stable work-surface. After testing, the flats are usually cleaned again and stored in a protective case, and are often kept in a temperature-controlled environment until used again. Lighting For the best test-results, a monochromatic light, consisting of only a single wavelength, is used to illuminate the flats. To show the fringes properly, several factors need to be taken into account when setting up the light source, such as the angle of incidence between the light and the observer, the angular size of the light source in relation to the pupil of the eye, and the homogeneity of the light source when reflected off of the glass. Many sources for monochromatic light can be used. Most lasers emit light of a very narrow bandwidth, and often provide a suitable light source. A helium–neon laser emits light at 632 nanometers (red), while a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser emits light at 532 nm (green). Various laser diodes and diode-pumped solid- state lasers emit light in red, yellow, green, blue or violet. Dye lasers can be tuned to emit nearly any color. However, lasers also experience a phenomenon called laser speckle, which shows up in the fringes. Several gas or metal-vapor lamps can also be used. When operated at low pressure and current, these lamps generally produce light in various spectral lines, with one or two lines being most predominant. Because these lines are very narrow, the lamps can be combined with narrow-bandwidth filters to isolate the strongest line. A helium-discharge lamp will produce a line at 587.6 nm (yellow), while a mercury-vapor lamp produces a line at 546.1 (yellowish green). Cadmium vapor produces a line at 643.8 nm (red), but low pressure sodium produces a line at 589.3 nm (yellow). Of all the lights, low pressure sodium is the only one that produces a single line, requiring no filter. The fringes only appear in the reflection of the light source, so the optical flat must be viewed from the exact angle of incidence that the light shines upon it. If viewed from a zero degree angle (from directly above), the light must also be at a zero degree angle. As the viewing angle changes, the lighting angle must also change. The light must be positioned so that its reflection can be seen covering the entire surface. Also, the angular size of the light source needs to be many times greater than the eye. For example, if an incandescent light is used, the fringes may only show up in the reflection of the filament. By moving the lamp much closer to the flat, the angular size becomes larger and the filament may appear to cover the entire flat, giving clearer readings. Sometimes, a diffuser may be used, such as the powder coating inside frosted bulbs, to provide a homogenous reflection off the glass. Typically, the measurements will be more accurate when the light source is as close to the flat as possible, but the eye is as far away as possible.Optical Shop Testing by Daniel Malacara – John Wiley and Sons 2009 Page 10–12 How interference fringes form How interference works. The distance between the bright fringe (a) and the dark fringe (b) indicates a change in the light path length of 1/2 the wavelength, so a change of the width of the gap of 1/4 wavelength. So the distance between two bright or dark fringes indicates a change in the gap of 1/2 wavelength. The gap between the surfaces and the wavelength of the light waves are greatly exaggerated. The diagram at right shows an optical flat resting on a surface to be tested. Unless the two surfaces are perfectly flat, there will be a small gap between them (shown), which will vary with the contour of the surface. Monochromatic light (red) shines through the glass flat and reflects from both the bottom surface of the optical flat and the top surface of the test piece, and the two reflected rays combine and superpose. However, the ray reflecting off the bottom surface travels a longer path. The additional path length is equal to twice the gap between the surfaces. In addition, the ray reflecting off the bottom surface undergoes a 180° phase reversal, while the internal reflection of the other ray from the underside of the optical flat causes no phase reversal. The brightness of the reflected light depends on the difference in the path length of the two rays: If the gap between the surfaces is not constant, this interference results in a pattern of bright and dark lines or bands called \\"interference fringes\\" being observed on the surface. These are similar to contour lines on maps, revealing the height differences of the bottom test surface. The gap between the surfaces is constant along a fringe. The path length difference between two adjacent bright or dark fringes is one wavelength of the light, so the difference in the gap between the surfaces is one-half wavelength. Since the wavelength of light is so small, this technique can measure very small departures from flatness. For example, the wavelength of red light is about 700 nm, so the difference in height between two fringes is half that, or 350 nm, about 1/100 the diameter of a human hair. Mathematical derivation The variation in brightness of the reflected light as a function of gap width d\\\\, can be found by deriving the formula for the sum of the two reflected waves. Assume that the z-axis is oriented in the direction of the reflected rays. Assume for simplicity that the intensity A of the two reflected light rays is the same (this is almost never true, but the result of differences in intensity is just a smaller contrast between light and dark fringes). The equation for the electric field of the sinusoidal light ray reflected from the top surface traveling along the z-axis is :E_1(z, t) = A\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi z}{\\\\lambda} - \\\\omega t\\\\right) where A\\\\, is the peak amplitude, λ is the wavelength, and \\\\omega = 2\\\\pi f\\\\, is the angular frequency of the wave. The ray reflected from the bottom surface will be delayed by the additional path length and the 180° phase reversal at the reflection, causing a phase shift \\\\phi\\\\, with respect to the top ray :E_2(z, t) = A\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi z}{\\\\lambda} - \\\\omega t + \\\\phi\\\\right)\\\\, where \\\\phi\\\\, is the phase difference between the waves in radians. The two waves will superpose and add: the sum of the electric fields of the two waves is :E = E_1 + E_2 = A\\\\left[\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi z}{\\\\lambda} - \\\\omega t\\\\right) + \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi z}{\\\\lambda} - \\\\omega t + \\\\phi\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\, Using the trigonometric identity for the sum of two cosines: \\\\cos a + \\\\cos b = 2\\\\cos\\\\left({a + b \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\cos\\\\left({a - b \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\,, this can be written :E = 2A\\\\cos\\\\left({\\\\phi \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\cos\\\\left({2\\\\pi z \\\\over \\\\lambda} - \\\\omega t + {\\\\phi \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\, This represents a wave at the original wavelength whose amplitude is proportional to the cosine of \\\\frac{\\\\phi}{2}, so the brightness of the reflected light is an oscillating, sinusoidal function of the gap width d. The phase difference \\\\phi is equal to the sum of the phase shift {2\\\\pi \\\\over \\\\lambda}(2d)\\\\, due to the path length difference 2d and the additional 180° phase shift at the reflection :\\\\phi = {4\\\\pi d \\\\over \\\\lambda} + \\\\pi = 2\\\\pi\\\\left({2d \\\\over \\\\lambda} + {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right) so the electric field of the resulting wave will be :E = 2A \\\\cos\\\\left[\\\\pi\\\\left({2d \\\\over \\\\lambda} + {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\cos\\\\left[{2\\\\pi z \\\\over \\\\lambda} - \\\\omega t + \\\\pi\\\\left({2d \\\\over \\\\lambda} + {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\, This represents an oscillating wave whose magnitude varies sinusoidally between 2A and zero as d increases. *Constructive interference: The brightness will be maximum where \\\\left\\\\cos\\\\pi\\\\left({2d \\\\over \\\\lambda} + {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\right = 1\\\\,, which occurs when *: \\\\begin{align} \\\\pi\\\\left({2d \\\\over \\\\lambda} + {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right) &= n\\\\pi,\\\\quad n \\\\in {0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow d &= \\\\left(n - {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right){\\\\lambda \\\\over 2} \\\\end{align} *Destructive interference: The brightness will be zero (or in the more general case minimum) where \\\\left\\\\cos\\\\pi\\\\left({2d \\\\over \\\\lambda} + {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\right = 0\\\\,, which occurs when *:\\\\begin{align} \\\\pi\\\\left({2d \\\\over \\\\lambda} + {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right) &= \\\\left(n + {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\pi,\\\\quad n \\\\in {0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow d &= n{\\\\lambda \\\\over 2} \\\\end{align} Thus the bright and dark fringes alternate, with the separation between two adjacent bright or dark fringes representing a change in the gap length of one half wavelength (λ/2). Precision and errors Two λ/10 flats at 589 nm. Although both surfaces have some irregularities, the test shows they are both flat relative to each other. As wringing progresses the thin fringes widen until only a single fringe remains. A thermal image of an optical flat after handling for just a few seconds. The warmer areas increase the thickness of the flat over cooler areas, distorting the surface accordingly. Counterintuitively, the fringes do not exist within the gap or the flat itself. The interference fringes actually form when the light waves all converge at the eye or camera, forming the image. Because the image is the compilation of all converging wavefronts interfering with each other, the flatness of the test piece can only be measured relative to the flatness of the optical flat. Any deviations on the flat will be added to the deviations on the test surface. Therefore, a surface polished to a flatness of λ/4 cannot be effectively tested with a λ/4 flat, as it is not possible to determine where the errors lie, but its contours can be revealed by testing with more accurate surfaces like a λ/20 or λ/50 optical flat. This also means that both the lighting and viewing angle have an effect on the accuracy of the results. When lighted or viewed at an angle, the distance that the light must travel across the gap is longer than when viewed and illuminated straight on. Thus, as the angle of incidence becomes steeper, the fringes will also appear to move and change. A zero degree angle of incidence is usually the most desirable angle, both for lighting and viewing. Unfortunately, this is usually impossible to achieve with the naked eye. Many interferometers use beamsplitters to obtain such an angle. Because the results are relative to the wavelength of the light, accuracy can also be increased by using light of shorter wavelengths, although the 632 nm line from a helium–neon laser is often used as the standard.Metrology & Measurement by Bewoor – McGraw-Hill 2009 Page 224–230 No surface is ever completely flat. Therefore, any errors or irregularities that exist on the optical flat will affect the results of the test. Optical flats are extremely sensitive to temperature changes, which can cause temporary surface deviations resulting from uneven thermal expansion. The glass often experiences poor thermal conduction, taking a long time to reach thermal equilibrium. Merely handling the flats can transfer enough heat to offset the results, so glasses such as fused silica or borosilicate are used, which have very low coefficients of thermal expansion. The glass needs to be hard and very stable, and is usually very thick to prevent flexing. When measuring on the nanometer scale, the slightest bit of pressure can cause the glass to flex enough to distort the results. Therefore, a very flat and stable work-surface is also needed, on which the test can be performed, preventing both the flat and the test-piece from sagging under their combined weight, Often, a precision-ground surface plate is used as a work surface, providing a steady table-top for testing upon. To provide an even flatter surface, sometimes the test may be performed on top of another optical flat, with the test surface sandwiched in the middle. Absolute flatness Absolute flatness is the flatness of an object when measured against an absolute scale, in which the reference flat (standard) is completely free of irregularities. The flatness of any optical flat is relative to the flatness of the original standard that was used to calibrate it. Therefore, because both surfaces have some irregularities, there are few ways to know the true, absolute flatness of any optical flat. The only surface that can achieve nearly absolute flatness is a liquid surface, such as mercury, and can sometimes achieve flatness readings to within λ/100, which equates to a deviation of only 6.32 nm (632 nm/100). However, liquid flats are very difficult to use and align properly, so they are typically only used when preparing a standard flat for calibrating other flats. The other method for determining absolute flatness is the \\"three-flat test.\\" In this test, three flats of equal size and shape are tested against each other. By analyzing the patterns and their different phase shifts, the absolute contours of each surface can be extrapolated. This usually requires at least twelve individual tests, checking each flat against every other flat in at least two different orientations. To eliminate any errors, the flats sometimes may be tested while resting on edge, rather than lying flat, helping to prevent sagging.Handbook of Optical Metrology: Principles and Applications by Toru Yoshizawa – CRC Press 2003 Page 426–428 Wringing Optical flats being used to calibrate metal parts Wringing occurs when nearly all of the air becomes forced out from between the surfaces, causing the surfaces to lock together, partly through the vacuum between them. The flatter the surfaces; the better they will wring together, especially when the flatness extends all the way to the edges. If two surfaces are very flat, they may become wrung together so tightly that a lot of force may be needed to separate them. The interference fringes typically only form once the optical flat begins to wring to the testing surface. If the surfaces are clean and very flat, they will begin to wring almost immediately after the first contact. After wringing begins, as air is slowly forced out from between the surfaces, an optical wedge forms between the surfaces. The interference fringes form perpendicular to this wedge. As the air is forced out, the fringes will appear to move toward the thickest gap, spreading out and becoming wider but fewer. As the air is forced out, the vacuum holding the surfaces together becomes stronger. The optical flat should usually never be allowed to fully wring to the surface, otherwise it can be scratched or even broken when separating them. In some cases, if left for many hours, a block of wood may be needed to knock them loose. Testing flatness with an optical flat is typically done as soon a viable interference pattern develops, and then the surfaces are separated before they can fully wring. Because the angle of the wedge is extremely shallow and the gap extremely small, wringing may take a few hours to complete. Sliding the flat in relation to the surface can speed up wringing, but trying to press the air out will have little effect. If the surfaces are insufficiently flat, if any oil films or impurities exist on the surface, or if slight dust-particles land between the surfaces, they may not wring at all. Therefore, the surfaces must be very clean and free of debris to get an accurate measurement.Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook by W. H. Cubberly, Ramon Bakerjian – Society of Manufacturing Engineers 1989Page 12-13 Determining surface shape float- glass optical window. By placing a ruler across the image, adjacent to a fringe, and counting how many fringes cross it, the flatness of the surface can be measured along any line. The window has a flatness of 4–6λ (~2100–3100nm) per inch. harmonic opposites (green is λ/4 shorter), so the fringes overlap every fourth red-fringe (every fifth green-fringe), interfering to form yellow fringes. The fringes act very much like the lines on a topography map, where the fringes are always perpendicular to the wedge between the surfaces. When wringing first begins, there is a large angle in the air wedge and the fringes will resemble grid topography-lines. If the fringes are straight; then the surface is flat. If the surfaces are allowed to fully wring and become parallel, the straight fringes will widen until only a dark fringe remains, and they will disappear completely. If the surface is not flat, the grid lines will have some bends in them, indicating the topography of the surface. Straight fringes with bends in them may indicate a raised elevation or a depression. Straight fringes with a \\"V\\" shape in the middle indicate a ridge or valley running across the center, while straight fringes with curves near the ends indicate edges that are either rounded-off or have a raised lip. If the surfaces are not completely flat, as wringing progresses the fringes will widen and continue to bend. When fully wrung, they will resemble contour topography-lines, indicating the deviations on the surface. Rounded fringes indicate gentle sloping or slightly cylindrical surfaces, while tight corners in the fringes indicate sharp angles in the surface. Small, round circles may indicate bumps or depressions, while concentric circles indicate a conical shape. Unevenly spaced concentric circles indicate a convex or concave surface. Before the surfaces fully wring, these fringes will be distorted due to the added angle of the air wedge, changing into the contours as the air is slowly pushed out. A single dark-fringe has the same gap thickness, following a line that runs the entire length of the fringe. The adjacent bright-fringe will indicate a thickness which is either 1/2 of the wavelength narrower or 1/2 of the wavelength wider. The thinner and closer the fringes are; the steeper the slope is, while wider fringes, spaced further apart, show a shallower slope. Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell whether the fringes are indicating an uphill or downhill slope from just a single view of the fringes alone, because the adjacent fringes can be going either way. A ring of concentric circles can indicate that the surface is either concave or convex, which is an effect similar to the hollow-mask illusion. There are three ways to test the surface for shape, but the most common is the \\"finger- pressure test.\\" In this test, slight pressure is applied to the flat, to see which way the fringes move. The fringes will move away from the narrow end of the wedge. If the testing surface is concave, when pressure is applied to the center of the rings, the flat will flex a little and the fringes will appear to move inward. However, if the surface is convex, the flat will be in point- contact with the surface in that spot, so it will have no room to flex. Thus, the fringes will remain stationary, merely growing a little wider. If pressure is applied to the edge of the flat something similar happens. If the surface is convex the flat will rock a little, causing the fringes to move toward the finger. However, if the surface is concave the flat will flex a little, and the fringes will move away from the finger toward the center. Although this is called a \\"finger\\" pressure test, a wooden stick or some other instrument is often used to avoid heating the glass (with the mere weight of a toothpick often being enough pressure). Another method involves exposing the flat to white light, allowing rainbow fringes to form, and then pressing in the center. If the surface is concave, there will be point-contact along the edge, and the outer fringe will turn dark. If the surface is convex, there will be point-contact in the center, and the central fringe will turn dark. Much like tempering colors of steel, the fringes will be slightly brownish at the narrower side of the fringe and blue on the wider side, so if the surface is concave the blue will be on the inside of the rings, but if convex the blue will be on the outside. The third method involves moving the eye in relation to the flat. When moving the eye from a zero-degree angle of incidence to an oblique angle, the fringes will appear to move. If the testing surface is concave, the fringes will appear to move toward the center. If the surface is convex, the fringes will move away from the center. To get a truly accurate reading of the surface, the test should usually be performed in at least two different directions. As grid lines, the fringes only represent part of a grid, so a valley running across the surface may only show as a slight bend in the fringe if it is running parallel to the valley. However, if the optical flat is rotated 90 degrees and retested, the fringes will run perpendicular to the valley and it will show up as a row of \\"V\\" or \\"U\\" shaped contours in the fringes. By testing in more than one orientation, a better map of the surface can be made.Optical Shop Testing by Daniel Malacara – John Wiley and Sons 2009 Page 5–9  Long-term stability  During reasonable care and use, optical flats need to maintain their flatness over long periods of time. Therefore, hard glasses with low coefficients of thermal expansion, such as fused silica, are often used for the manufacturing material. However, a few laboratory measurements of room temperature, fused-silica optical-flats have shown a motion consistent with a material viscosity on the order of 1017–1018 Pa·s. This equates to a deviation of a few nanometers over the period of a decade. Because the flatness of an optical flat is relative to the flatness of the original test flat, the true (absolute) flatness at the time of manufacture can only be determined by performing an interferometer test using a liquid flat, or by performing a \\"three flat test\\", in which the interference patterns produced by three flats are computer-analyzed. A few tests that have been carried out have shown that a deviation sometimes occurs on the fused silica's surface. However, the tests show that the deformation may be sporadic, with only some of the flats deforming during the test period, some partially deforming, and others remaining the same. The cause of the deformation is unknown and would never be visible to the human eye during a lifetime. (A λ/4 flat has a normal surface-deviation of 158 nanometers, while a λ/20 flat has a normal deviation of over 30 nm.) This deformation has only been observed in fused silica, while soda-lime glass still shows a viscosity of 1041Pa·s, which is many orders of magnitude higher.

Killian played professional baseball from 1902 to 1912, including seven seasons with the Detroit Tigers from 1904 to 1910. He recorded a won-loss record of 103-78 for a winning percentage of .569. Twice a 20-game winner (including a 25–13 season in 1907), Killian's career earned run average (ERA) of 2.38 ranks 26th best in major league history. He also helped lead the Tigers to three consecutive American League pennants from 1907 to 1909, including winning both games of a doubleheader on September 30, 1909, to clinch the third pennant. As a hitter, Killian posted a .209 batting average (127-for-609) with 56 runs, 52 RBI and 16 bases on balls. Killian allowed only nine home runs during his major league career. He holds the major league record for the longest streak without allowing a home run -- a streak of 1,001 innings that ran from September 19, 1903, to August 7, 1907. Killian played in the minor leagues for the Rockford Red Sox of the Three-I League (1902-1903) and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League (1910-1911). Early years Killian was born in 1876 in Racine, Wisconsin. He did not begin playing professional baseball until he was in his mid-1920s. He played independent baseball in Racine and worked in a planing mill where he was \\"receiving $1.25 per day for ten hours of hard manual labor.\\" Professional baseball player Rockford and Cleveland (1902-03) Killian began playing professional baseball in the spring of 1902 with the Rockford Red Sox of the Three-I League for a salary of $75 per month. He started 38 games at Rockford and compiled a 21-15 record with a 2.80 earned run average (ERA). Killian returned to Rockford in 1903 and compiled a 14-10 record in 24 games. In August 1903, Killian was sold by the Rockford team to the Cleveland Naps. Killian made his major league debut with Cleveland on August 25, 1903. He appeared in nine games in the closing weeks of the 1903 season, compiling a 3-4 record with a 2.48 ERA. Detroit Tigers (1904-10) =The \\"twilight twirler\\"= Killian in 1908 In January 1904, Killian was traded by the Naps with Jesse Stovall to the Detroit Tigers for Billy Lush. Killian pitched the rest of his major league career with the Tigers. In 1904, Killian had 32 complete games and a 2.44 ERA in 331 innings, but lost 20 games. The 1904 Tigers team (one year before the arrival of Ty Cobb) was a weak-hitting group that compiled a .231 team batting average (nearly 60 points lower than Mullin) and finished in seventh place. As proof that his 1904 win-loss record was not indicative of his talents, Killian battled Cy Young in one of the most remarkable pitching duels in history on May 11, 1904. Young and Killian each pitched 14 scoreless innings, before the Red Sox scored a run in the 15th inning, winning 1–0. Early in his career with the Tigers, Killian received the nicknames \\"Twilight Ed\\" and the \\"Twilight Twirler\\") after pitching multiple extra-inning games that extended into the twilight hours. In 1905, Killian reduced his ERA further to 2.27. He started 37 games and completed 33. He wound up with a 23–14 record, the third best win total in the American League and fourth best in complete games. His eight shutouts in 1905 was tops in the American League. =Suspension in 1906= Killian started only 16 games in 1906 and finished 10–6 with a 3.43 ERA. He missed several weeks of the season in August and September. He was suspended after a series of incidents in which he destroyed a telephone and various articles of furniture in the clubhouse in a rage, showed up on multiple occasions not \\"in condition to play ball\\", and trouble under the grandstand in which officers had to be called to prevent Killian from going on the field. During the suspension, Killian left Detroit and pitched semipro ball in Chicago (for $100 per game) and did not pitch in a game for the Tigers until September 19.(first game back after suspension) =1,001 innings without a home run= Between September 19, 1903, and August 7, 1907, a span of nearly four years and 1,001 innings, he did not allow an opposing batter to hit a home run. In his entire career, he allowed only nine home runs -- an average of one home run every 178 innings. According to BaseballLibrary.com, he was \\"the hardest pitcher to homer against in ML history.\\" He reportedly used a \\"sinkerball\\" to induce batters to hit ground balls. =Three consecutive American League pennants= 1911 tobacco card In 1907, Killian had the best season of his career. He started 41 games and compiled a 25–13 record with a 1.78 ERA. His ERA was 81 points lower than the league average of 2.59. He ranked among the American League's leaders with his 1.78 ERA (second), 25 wins (third), 29 complete games (sixth), and 1,270 batters faced (sixth). Killian also excelled as a batter in 1907, compiling a .320 batting average and .410 slugging percentage. His batting average was 73 points higher than the league average of .247. Killian's 8.0 wins above replacement (WAR) in 1907 was the highest of any player in the American League at any position, higher even than teammate Ty Cobb. Only Honus Wagner in the National League had a higher WAR rating at 9.0. Killian's performance helped lead the 1907 Tigers to their first American League pennant and was one of the best pitching performances in the club's history. Unfortunately, Killian's arm was worn out for the post-season, and he pitched only four innings in relief with no decision during the 1907 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. In 1908, Killian appeared in 27 games and compiled a 12-9 record and 2.99 ERA as the Tigers won their second consecutive pennant. He also started one game in the 1908 World Series, giving up five hits, three walks, and three earned runs in 2-1/3 innings. In 1909, Killian did not appear in his first game until mid- May. He ultimately appeared in 25 games and compiled an 11-9 record with a 1.71 ERA. On September 30, 1909, he pitched both games of a double-header against Boston and won both games to help the Tigers clinch their third consecutive American League pennant. He was pitching a no-hitter in the first game until the eighth inning and was then removed after the eighth inning to rest up for the second game. The Tigers won the first game by a 5-0 score. In the second game, Killian pitched a complete game (bringing his day's total to 17 innings), and the Tigers won by an 8-3 score. =Final season= In 1910, Killian appeared in only 11 games for the Tigers, compiling 4-3 record with a 3.04 ERA. He appeared in his final major league game on July 15, 1910. After seven seasons in a Detroit uniform, he was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League on August 2, 1910. At the time of his release, the Detroit Free Press wrote: > \\"Gameness has been one of Killian's chief assets.

History Built in 1969–1970, Summit Point Motorsports Park (then \\"Summit Point Raceway\\"), opened in 1969. The first races held there were SCCA regional races in the fall of 1969 with IMSA International Sedans being the first professional event,Results of Spring Sprints for Sedans, Summit Point Speedway, 30/5/1970 later to become The Radial Tire Series, and IMSA Pro Formula Ford. The event was held on Memorial Day, May 30, 1970. (The holiday was still celebrated on the 30th then.) Rasey Feezell won in an Alfa Romeo 4-door sedan, whose modifications were very questionable, taking home the grand sum of $200 prize money. Five of the eleven entrants were from Raleigh, North Carolina. During its early years and since SCCA held numerous events at the track. Several Regional and National races were run each year. Many racers got their start in the popular SCCA Driver's Schools held there by the Washington DC Region. Paul Newman ran several of his early races there in a Bob Sharp-prepared Datsun 510 sedan. He wished to be just another \\"racer\\" and did not want to be recognized at racing events as a \\"superstar\\", so he and wife Joanne Woodward kept to themselves and eschewed signing autographs. Few realized they were racing in the company of famous actors. The only outward clue was the plate on his 510's front bumper... \\"PLN\\" Over time the track was host to a number of professional races sanctioned by IMSA and the SCCA Trans-Am Series through the late 1980s.

Circuits Summit Point Main layout Summit Point Main Summit Point Main is a 10-turn, road course that features a main straight. This original circuit opened in 1970. The original layout did not include the \\"Carousel\\", presently denoted Turns 6 and 7. In the original layout, Turn 5 was a ~90 deg. left-hander leading to a 90 deg. right-hander at the entry to what is now denoted Turn 8. Therefore, the original layout had 8 turns (or 9 depending on how you counted them). The \\"Carousel\\" wasn't added until sometime after mid-1973.Per Steve Coleman, 1972 IMSA Radial Sedan Class A Champion, from a testing session late summer 1973. No longer used for professional auto races, it hosts many WKC, WKA, SCCA, Audi, Mazda Drivers, BMWCCA, NESBA, and NASA club races, track days, and schools. In addition, motorcycle races are run by CCS and WERA, which also holds national-level 6-hour endurance race. The Main Circuit is also the annual home of the Jefferson 500 vintage race and The 12 Hours at the Point endurance race.

The castle is noteworthy for its unusually high altitude of 935 m making it the third highest located castle in Slovakia. It also figures in several romantic legends about its remarkable owners. Murány Castle was built in the 13th century on a cliff overlooking a regional trade route. Its name was mentioned for the first time in 1271 (\\"arx Mwran\\"), when Stephen V of Hungary ceded the castle to Gunig comes. One of its owners, the robber baron Mátyás Basó (or Bacsó, in Slovak: Matúš Bašo), transformed the castle into a stronghold of bandits who robbed merchants and looted villages. After a siege by the royal army, the castle fell in 1548 and Basó was executed. One of the oldest Slovak songs, The Song About The Castle of Muráň written by Martin Bošňák describe this batlle. Another famous owner was Mária Széchy, better known as \\"The Venus of Murány\\". This astonishingly independent woman divorced her second husband to marry the love of her life – magnate Ferenc Wesselényi, the subsequent Palatine of Hungary. When Wesselényi was besieging Murány Castle, which was occupied by her relatives at the time, she even managed to get his soldiers inside through trickery. In 1666, Wesselényi organized a failed coup against Leopold I, but he died before any major confrontation. Subsequently, Mária Széchy bravely led a defense of the castle against Imperial troops. Outnumbered, she eventually surrendered to Charles of Lorraine in 1670. After the Treaty of Szatmár, the importance of the castle declined, so did its general condition. It was damaged twice in the 18th century by fire: in 1702 and in 1760. The area was part of Gömör, then Gömör és Kishont County of Hungary. In 1920, under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon it became part of the newly formed Czechoslovakia.

It is the predecessor of the University of California public university system. History In 1853, in the recently established town of Oakland, California, noted educators Rev. Henry Durant and Dr. Samuel H. Willey founded the Contra Costa Academy to provide boys with a liberal arts education with a strong emphasis on the classics. It was nominally nonsectarian with a general Christian atmosphere, although its trustees, educators, and supporters consisted of a coalition of Congregationalists and Presbyterians. This private college preparatory school grew quickly and by 1855, with the benefit of some government grants and a new charter, the newly renamed College of California opened in what by then had become the city of Oakland, on the four blocks bounded by Twelfth, Fourteenth, Franklin and Harrison Streets. Despite the new name, it did not add college-level courses until 1860. Within a few years, the downtown Oakland site had become unsuitable, owing to a lack of room for expansion, and the crowdedness and general rowdiness of the area. In 1866, the college trustees sought out a quieter, more rural site for their College. They planned to finance this expansion by selling land near the prospective college site. To this end, they formed the \\"College Homestead Association\\" and purchased 160 acres (65 hectares) of land north of Oakland on a site that is part of the City of Berkeley today. The College hired landscape architecture firm Olmsted, Vaux & Co. for recommendations on the site. Olmsted produced a 25-page survey and plan, dated June 29, 1866. Olmsted's work is now regarded as part of the legacy of UC Berkeley's planning, even though it was largely discarded. Sales of lots were less than had been hoped for. Even worse, although the college's trustees and supporters strongly believed in the importance of a liberal arts education, there was not much local interest in pursuing one at the college level. Meanwhile, the State of California had established an Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College in 1866, but it existed only on paper as a placeholder to secure federal land-grant funds. In 1867, Governor Frederick Low suggested a merger of the already-functional and land-rich but cash-poor College of California with the state college, which had money but nothing else. On October 9, 1867, the college's trustees reluctantly agreed to the merger on the condition that the new institution would be a complete university with a liberal arts college (the College of Letters, now the College of Letters and Science). They were aware the new state institution would have to be entirely secular but recognized it was more important to find some way to preserve the College of California's liberal arts educational mission as part of the new university. The University of California was chartered with the enactment of the Organic Act on March 23, 1868, although it continued to use the College of California's Oakland facilities while the campus at Berkeley was being built. In September 1873, the university moved, with great ceremony, to Berkeley. The site of the College of California in Oakland has been designated California Historical Landmark #45. As of May 2019, the site of the plaque at the corner of Franklin and 13th Street has been under construction as part of the Atlas development by Carmel Partners.http://www.carmelpartners.com/property/atlas/https://www.atlasoakland.com/  References  External links * Photographs and transcription of marker - Markeroni.com Category:University of California Category:University of California, Berkeley Category:History of Oakland, California Category:Education in Berkeley, California Category:Education in Oakland, California Category:California Historical Landmarks Category:Educational institutions established in 1855 Category:19th century in Oakland, California ","title":"College of California"},{"id":"4230678","text":"Josef Barák Josef Barák (26 January 1833 in Prague – 15 November 1883 in Prague) was a Czech politician, journalist, and poet.

Foran Freeway (Interstate 280, I-280) in the city of San Francisco. An alternative name for this highway feature is the Alemany Interchange. History The Alemany Maze gets its name from Alemany Boulevard, which is named for Joseph Sadoc Alemany. Alemany, who in 1840 completed his studies in sacred theology in Rome at the College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, was consecrated Bishop of Monterey in California on June 30, 1850, at Rome, and was transferred July 29, 1853, to the See of San Francisco as its first archbishop. The Alemany Maze is an interchange that originally controlled the separation of traffic travelling between the James Lick Freeway, Bayshore Boulevard, and Alemany Boulevard. The former US 101 Bypass, which followed Bayshore Boulevard to the south, separated from the old US 101 alignment at the Maze. The Alemany Boulevard routing of US 101 was eventually replaced by the construction of the Southern Freeway, later renamed the John Foran Freeway. The routing of US 101 was shifted to the Bayshore Freeway in 1964, with the former US 101 freeway becoming renumbered as part of I-280.US Highway 101, San Mateo/San Francisco Area, 1964 entry. Maze features The most notable features of the Alemany Maze are the double-deck ramps to and from US 101 from the south and the double-deck portion of I-280 northeast of the interchange. Although overall a north-south freeway, I-280 actually runs east–west through the interchange. The word maze refers to the series of interchanges necessary for a vehicle to maneuver in order to navigate their way from a multi-lane freeway to a narrower distribution structure of lanes which funnel to connector exit ramps, similar to the better known MacArthur Maze. Traffic reporters use these words combined with the Alemany Maze to indicate its bottleneck status. In spite of its size and complexity, like the MacArthur Maze, it does not allow full freedom of movement: drivers approaching the interchange in the southbound direction on either highway cannot directly access the northbound direction of the other highway.

The tollway would connect Interstate 294 (I-294, the Tri-State Tollway) to a western access point to the airport. From there, it would continue northward to an extension of the Illinois Route 390 and I-90 (Jane Addams Memorial Tollway). The O'Hare Western Bypass is part of the Elgin–O'Hare Western Access (EOWA) project. Building the highway would affect the villages of Elk Grove Village, Wood Dale, Itasca and Bensenville.. The proposed route runs through the American Airlines Flight 191 crash site, the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.  Route description  I-490 will begin at a partial interchange with I-294 (Tri-State Tollway) in Franklin Park, south of O'Hare International Airport.https://www.illinoistollway.com/documents/20184/840043/2018_490_I-294Interchange_MAP_120718.pdf/6fe9c8bc- bc00-4ce7-9581-2389f6ce42fa There will be an interchange with Franklin Ave / Green St. The tollway will head north before curving westward to briefly parallel the Canadian Pacific Railway before crossing it. Immediately afterwards, the tollway will have an interchange with Illinois Route 19 (IL 19, Irving Park Road). On the western side of O'Hare International Airport, I-490 will have an interchange with the IL 390 (Elgin–O'Hare Tollway) at the entrance to a planned western terminal. Continuing north, I-490 will cross over the Canadian Pacific Railway again and have an interchange with IL 72 (Touhy Avenue) before ending at a trumpet interchange with I-90 (Jane Addams Memorial Tollway) in Des Plaines. https://www.illinoistollway.com/documents/20184/656198/2018_I-490_90-490Interchange_090518.pdf/dbdbb28c-13ae-4dab- bbf7-d122321e87f5  History  In December 2009, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) finalized the routing of the western bypass. Intermediate interchanges are planned at County Line Road/Franklin Avenue, IL 19, IL 390 and IL 72. On August 25, 2011, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISHTA) approved a $12 billion capital plan called Move Illinois, which seeks to improve toll roads under their jurisdiction; the authority doubled toll rates to help fund it. The bypass is also part of the EOWA project. On October 6, 2014, IDOT submitted an application to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for the creation of the new I-490 designation. AASHTO approved the I-490 designation on November 20, 2014, contingent on Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approval. In November 2015, the Canadian Pacific Railroad sought a federal injunction to block ISHTA from acquiring land in the Bensenville Rail Yard to build the tollway, over fears that this would impact rail traffic. In 2016, ISHTA sued the Canadian Pacific Railway to request that the United States Surface Transportation Board allow for the construction of the tollway. On June 13, 2018, ISHTA and Canadian Pacific Railroad agreed to settle the dispute. Construction on the interchange with I-90 began on September 12, 2018; the interchange was scheduled to be finished in 2023. The project is planned to be finished in 2025. In preparation for the interchange at Interstate 90, and the widening of I-90, the Des Plaines over-highway oasis structure was permanently closed on March 16, 2014. The over-highway oasis structure began to be deconstructed immediately, but the gas stations and gas station stores remained open. These businesses were eventually closed on December 14, 2018. The oasis, which opened on June 24, 1959, was the second oldest of the five original tollway oases in Illinois. The gas station buildings were finally demolished in April 2019, and the new bridge decks over I-90, placed almost exactly where the oasis was previously located, were installed in June 2019.

It was the home stadium for the Rochester Red Wings of the International League from 1929 to 1996, and for the New York Black Yankees of the Negro National League for their final season in 1948. The ballpark also briefly hosted professional football as it was the home field for the Rochester Braves (second American Football League) in 1936 and the Rochester Tigers (second American Football League) in 1936 and 1937. The facility opened May 2, 1929, as Red Wing Stadium. It was renamed Silver Stadium on August 19, 1968, for Morrie Silver, then the president of Rochester Community Baseball, Inc. Silver Stadium hosted its final event, a Governors' Cup playoff game between the Columbus Clippers and the Red Wings, on September 10, 1996, and was demolished in late 1997 and early 1998. The site is now an industrial and office park. History Silver Stadium cost $415,000 to construct and opened on May 2, 1929, as Red Wing Stadium. At the time, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 15,000. The park was built in the middle of a thriving urban residential neighborhood, which like most suffered a decline in the latter half of the century. Plentiful parking for automobiles, not a huge concern at the time it was built, became an issue as more and more fans drove their cars to the ballpark. In late 1956, the St. Louis Cardinals, then the major league affiliate of the Rochester Red Wings and also the owners of Red Wing Stadium and the Red Wings, were exploring the possibility of removing the franchise from their minor league system. In response, Morrie Silver, a Rochester businessman, spearheaded an effort to purchase both assets from the Cardinals. A total of 8,222 stockholders, including Silver, came together to form Rochester Community Baseball, Inc. (RCB) The effort was ultimately successful as RCB purchased both assets on February 27, 1957, ensuring that the team would remain in Rochester for the 1957 season and beyond. Red Wing Stadium was renamed Silver Stadium in Silver's honor on August 19, 1968.Date given on base plate of 2007 Red Wings bobblehead promotion commemorating the 1968 stadium renaming Major League Baseball mandated changes to minor league ballparks in the 1990s to both upgrade the field of play and the facilities that the players used. Even though it was renovated in the mid-1980s, Silver was deficient in a number of these areas. Like most old ballparks of its era, it did not have any corporate luxury suites. The official story is that public sentiment in Rochester was in favor of building a new ballpark somewhere closer to the downtown area, with plenty of parking and access to expressways. However, at various times, proposals were made to build the new stadium in one of Rochester's suburbs, namely Greece, Avon and Victor. Ground was broken on Frontier Field, a new stadium located in downtown Rochester next to Eastman Kodak's world headquarters, in 1995. Frontier Field opened on July 11, 1996, allowing Silver Stadium to close on September 10, 1996. Silver Stadium was demolished in late 1997 and early 1998, and the site is now an industrial and office park. Events The Rochester Red Wings of the International League moved from the Bay Street Ball Grounds to Red Wing Stadium following the 1928 season. Red Wing Stadium opened May 2, 1929, with a regular season game between the Red Wings and the Reading Keystones. Rochester lost, 3–0. The Wings continued to play at the facility until the 1996 season. On August 30, 1996, the Red Wings lost, 8–5, to the Ottawa Lynx in the final regular season game at Silver Stadium. Rochester also lost the final game ever at Silver Stadium, game two of the Governors' Cup Finals on September 10, 1996, by a margin of 4–0 to the Columbus Clippers. The Red Wings moved to Frontier Field for the 1997 season. The New York Black Yankees of the Negro National League played at Red Wing Stadium in 1948. The season was the last in the team's history. Outside of baseball, the ballpark briefly hosted professional football as Red Wing Stadium was the home field for the Rochester Braves (second American Football League) in 1936 and the Rochester Tigers (second American Football League) in 1936 and 1937. Johnny Antonelli, a Rochester native who won the 1954 World Series as part of the New York Giants, ran a local Firestone business which sponsored \\"Johnny Antonelli Night\\" each year at the ballpark. As part of the festivities, the company would give away tires and televisions during the games. Jim Kelly held his fourth-annual StarGaze charity event at the stadium in June 1995.https://buffalonews.com/news/stargaze-calls-rochester-home-this- year/article_a3f7380e-5f1e-550a-b64d-ee58ada971d0.html The largest attendance at the stadium was 31,000, for a concert by The Grateful Dead on June 30, 1988, eclipsing their previous record of 30,100, on July 2, 1987.Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, July 3, 1987 and Rochester Times-Union, July 1, 1988 The second largest attendance corresponded to a “Billy Graham Crusade” in September of 1988 which featured christian artist Steve Green.

The western terminus of the road is in Sheridan Township at exit 119 off Interstate 94 (I-94). The eastern terminus is a junction with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) downtown Albion. The entire road is within Calhoun County and runs through rural farm fields outside of Albion; in town it is a residential street. The M-199 designation had previously been applied to a highway in the Upper Peninsula in the 1930s. The current highway was previously part of other highways in the first half of the 20th century before it was transferred to local control around 1960. It was later transferred back to state control in 1998 and remains unchanged since. Route description As a two-lane roadway, M-199 starts at exit 119 along I-94 northwest of Albion in Sheridan Township. The highway runs southward through farm fields along 26 Mile Road before curving to the southwest on Star Commonwealth Road near the campus of the Montcalm School for Boys and Girls, a private boarding school. At the end of this curves, the highway follows 25½ Mile Road southward to the intersection with Michigan Avenue. There M-199 turns easterly along Michigan Avenue and passes south of Montcalm Lake. The trunkline runs parallel to a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway until about the intersection with 26½ Mile Road. At the intersection with 27 Mile Road, M-199 enters the city of Albion, and the street name changes to Austin Avenue. In town, the highway follows a four-lane street through residential neighborhoods. The trunkline passes the northern edge of McAuliffe Park and runs parallel to the Kalamazoo River. At the intersection with Eaton Street, the highway meets BL I-94, where M-199 ends while the business loop continues southeasterly on Austin Avenue at this corner. M-199 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that 1,185 vehicles per day used the roadway between I-94 and Michigan Avenue and between 3,174 and 4,042 vehicles used section along the combined Michigan and Austin avenues. No sections of M-199 have been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History In the middle of 1933, an earlier designation of M-199 was used for a short spur route from US Highway 41 (US 41) into Daggett in Menominee County. This highway was decommissioned in 1939. The current M-199 was once part of M-17 starting around July 1, 1919. When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the highway was incorporated into US 12. The Albion area was bypassed by a freeway (now I-94) at the end of the 1950s, and Michigan Avenue was turned over to local control. The current highway routing was transferred to state control on October 1, 1998, and the M-199 designation was subsequently assigned to the trunkline. The highway has remained unchanged since designation.

Life and works Durych was born in Hradec Králové and was orphaned at an early age. He attended school at the Archbishop's convent in Příbram, but was expelled for reading forbidden literature. Later, he was able to attend medical school in Prague, thanks to a military scholarship, and graduated in 1913. After serving as a military doctor in Galicia during World War I, he established a private practice in Přerov. This proved to be an unsuccessful enterprise, however, and he returned to the Army; rising to the rank of Colonel. From 1923 to 1930, he served as the head of the military hospital near Olomouc. In 1935, he was elected to the , but resigned in 1938 following the Anschluss. Throughout the Nazi occupation and the communist regime, he remained isolated and was able to publish only a few newspaper articles, written under pseudonyms. Under the influence of Josef Florian, he published his first novel, ' (Wandering, 1929), an historical piece set in the time of the Thirty Years' War, then Služebníci neužiteční (Roughly: Useless Servants), a novel about Jesuit missionaries in 17th-century Japan, led by Charles Spinola. Only the first part could be published in Czechoslovakia, because Durych was silenced following the Communist coup d'état in 1948. A full four volume edition was published in Rome in 1969. Bloudění was translated into English as Descent of the Idol and published in the United States in 1936. Durych's Catholic viewpoint was often at odds with the prevailing intellectual climate in the Czechoslovak First Republic; notably his positive evaluation of the developments in Bohemia and baroque culture in general that followed the Battle of White Mountain. Durych felt that the loss suffered there by Frederick V of the Palatinate saved Bohemia from becoming a part of Germany. He was also the target of heavy criticism for supporting the Falangist side during the Spanish Civil War. Durych died in Prague. References * Novák, Arne. Přehledné dějiny literatury české.

History  Cornell Companies, through predecessor entities, began operations of juvenile facilities in 1973, adult- community-based programs in 1974, and adult secure facilities in 1984. In 1996, Cornell Companies was officially incorporated in the State of Delaware as a consolidated entity. By 2010, Cornell had established long-standing relationships with a number of significant federal and state customers, including a nearly 20-year relationship with the Bureau of Prisons in its Adult Secure division and a 35-year relationship with the Bureau of Prisons in its Adult Community-Based division. Also, in Cornell's Abraxas juvenile division, more than 70% of revenue was sourced from customers over 15+ years. Cornell had significant contracts with the Departments of Corrections in the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Mississippi and Arizona.  Business segments  Cornell Companies offered a diverse portfolio of services in structured and secure environments through three operating divisions: * Adult Secure Services * Adult Community-Based Services * Abraxas Youth and Family Services Within the Adult Secure Services segment, Cornell provided minimum- to maximum-security incarceration services for federal, state and local government agencies. Cornell's Adult Community-Based Services involved the supervision of adult parolees and probationers. Cornell offered a national presence with locations in many large urban areas, throughout the United States. Cornell was a leading provider of community-based services to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons and to a number of state corrections departments. The Abraxas Youth & Family Services division included residential, detention, shelter care and community-based services, along with educational, rehabilitation and treatment programs for juveniles, typically between the ages of 10 and 18.  Employees  At December 31, 2008, Cornell had 4,109 full-time employees and 300 part-time employees. Cornell employs management, administrative and clerical, security, educational and counseling services, health services and general maintenance personnel. Controversies Frank Prewitt, Cornell's consultant in Alaska, acknowledged making a prohibited campaign contribution in 2002 that was actually from Cornell. It could have resulted in a civil fine or written warning if the violation had come to the attention of the Alaska Public Offices Commission. The issue was moot because fines or warnings for Alaska campaign contribution violations can only be issued within twelve months of the alleged violation (Alaska Statutes 15.56.130).Anchorage Daily News 07/03/07http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2007/July/07_crm_489.html, United States Department of Justice, 9 July 2007.

The number of prisoners at the facility increased but Cornell did not adjust staffing appropriately. A state audit in 2005 showed the guard to prisoner ratio was 1 to 60, which was believed to contribute to the rate of violence and abuses. According to the Council for Juvenile Correctional Administrators, a ratio of 1 to 10 or 12 is more common. In addition, prisoners were aging; by 2006 prisoners up to age 21 were housed there. Older prisoners in their early 20s were added during expansion of the capacity. These changes made conditions more harsh for younger inmates. As of 2006 the prison housed 950 prisoners ages 12 to 21.Hipp, Laura. \\"Inmates get jobs in pilot program.\\" The Clarion Ledger. December 25, 2006. Main A1.

Walnut Grove received payment in lieu of taxes from the prison corporation, monies that made up 15% of its annual budget. William Grady Sims, mayor of Walnut Grove since 1981, profited from the revenues of 18 vending machines he had installed at the WGCF. By 2009, the prison had 1,225 prisoners.

In November 2010, plaintiffs represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU National Prison Project filed a federal class-action lawsuit against GEO and the state agencies that contracted for the facility, saying that the prison authorities allowed abuses and negligence to occur at the facility. The lawsuit stated that prison guards engaged in sexual intercourse with the prisoners, tolerated and encouraged violence, smuggled illegal drugs into the facilities, and that prison authorities denied required education and sufficient medical care.

Sophia Jex- Blake was appointed as both the Director and the Dean of the School. The first class of women to study at the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women consisted of eight students, the youngest of whom was nineteen years of age. Throughout its twelve years in operation, the school struggled to find financial funding to keep its doors open. A rival institution, the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women, set up by Elsie Inglis with the help of her father John Inglis, attracted several students of Jex-Blake, including Martha Cadell and Grace Cadell. St Mungo’s College and Queen Margaret College in Glasgow also accepted women medical students and when the Scottish universities began to do so the Edinburgh School of Medicine could no longer compete. The school folded and closed its doors in 1898. Over the twelve years of its operation, the Edinburgh School of Medicine provided education to approximately eighty female students. Of those eighty students, thirty-three completed the full course of medical training at the Edinburgh School while many others chose to finish their education at outside institutions.  Background about the founder  The first step in Sophia Jex-Blake's journey to obtaining entry into a medical program was by requesting permission from Professor JJ Balfour, who served as the Dean of the Medical Faculty, to participate in the University of Edinburgh Medical College’s summer classes. Following this request, the faculty at the University voted to determine the fate of Blake and future women’s admission into their medical program. On one hand, she received support in her pursuit of medical education as long as women were educated solely in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. However, other faculty members were opposed to allowing females to study medicine on the foundation of intellectual inferiority. One such individual was Robert Christison, who believed that allowing women to study medicine would diminish the quality of the medical field because women were not only less intelligent than men, but also too fragile to endure the rigorous coursework demanded by such a profession. In spite of some opposition to Sophia Jex-Blake’s request, the faculty vote ended in favor of her admission to the program. The admission of Sophia Jex-Blake into the University of Edinburgh Medical College did not go without controversy and upheaval from university attendees. After the initial vote granted Jex-Blake admission to the program, Claud Murihead, who worked with the Royal Infirmary, brought forward an appeal to overturn the decision. Backed by a petition signed by approximately 200 students, Murihead’s appeal resulted in a reversal of the decision to admit Jex-Blake. The argument that led to the decision was that men and women should be educated separately, and thus providing courses for a single female student would be inefficient and financially unconscionable. The fight did not end there, however. During the appeal, Jex-Blake was represented by David Masson, who was both a friend and advocate of her cause. Masson argued that the cost of educating men and women separately could be offset by increasing the number of women enrolled. With a greater number of female medical students, the University would have the resources to provide separate courses for women without producing a financial headache. David Russel, who edited a local newspaper The Scotsman, was a friend to Jex-Blake and published the story regarding the admissions debate as well as Masson’s proposed solution. Inspired by Jex-Blake, more women applied to the University of Edinburgh Medical College.  The \\"Edinburgh Seven\\"  After over a decade of refusing to admit women into their medical school, some lecturers at the Extramural School in Edinburgh accepted women into their classes. The “Edinburgh Seven,” consisting of Sophia Jex-Blake, Isabel Thorne, Edith Pechey, Matilda Chaplin, Helen Evans, Mary Anderson, and Emily Bovell were the first women to be admitted into the medical program in 1869. However, acceptance into the program was just the beginning of the challenges they would face. The Edinburgh Seven were charged higher fees than their male counterparts, as a result of smaller class sizes. In addition, while the University had granted their faculty the permission to teach women, it was not a requirement. Professors could refuse to teach female students if they felt it necessary to do so. As a result, these women had to arrange classes on their own instead of being assigned courses by the University program. Furthermore, despite equivalent coursework and lectures, the all-female classes were graded on a different scale than the male classes. This reduced the ability of these women to qualify for scholarships offered by the university based on academic success and achievement. The grading policy and limitations to available lectures and training were not the only challenges faced by these women. The male students at the university were displeased with the school's decision to admit females into the program. As a result, the male students exhibited aggressive behavior and harassment toward their female counterparts on campus. Tension between the students reached a point of violence, and eventually a riot ensued. As the women arrived to take an anatomy examination, they were met by male student protestors who threw mud at them. The riot was publicized by local newspapers, which fostered public support for the plight faced by the female students. However, the violence had sparked fear at the university and resulted in the decision to allow women to participate in the medical program to be revisited. The university made the decision to revoke the women's admission, and they were declined from the program in the middle of their studies.  Inspiration for establishment  As the opportunity to receive a medical education became increasingly available to women in Edinburgh and abroad, Jex-Blake was inspired to establish her own medical college for female students. Jex-Blake's first step in this endeavor was to notify the National Association for Promoting the Medical Education of Women of her desire to open a school that offered a medical education exclusively to women. However, before she was granted permission to do so by the Association, Jex-Blake began reaching out to potential students and publicizing her medical program. Sophia Jex-Blake's intention for this establishment was to cater to the local community in Edinburgh. Thus, she did not include the price of housing in the proposed cost of tuition and books, as it was assumed that most students would be residents in the Edinburgh area and would be living at home. History It was ten years since the first UK women had been licensed to practise as doctors, and it would be another six years before Scottish universities would admit women students. Jex-Blake had friends in Edinburgh, as well as opponents, from her earlier unsuccessful campaign to persuade the University of Edinburgh to educate women in their medical school. Lectures took place in the School's premises in Surgeons' Square. The Royal Infirmary, the main teaching hospital, continued to refuse women students. The Royal Infirmary argued that it would produce an undue burden on the hospital staff to make special arrangements specifically for the female students, as it was the main location for the male students undergoing clinical training. As a result, Jex- Blake was forced to search for another institution for her students to be taught, and arranged for them to have clinical teaching at Leith Hospital.  Closing  Jex-Blake's uncompromising approach to discipline led to problems. She was a strict rule enforcer and maintained high expectations for her students. She established strict guidelines for acceptable behavior and conduct during lectures, examinations, and training at the hospital. The academic demands Jex-Blake imposed on her students and her disciplinary persona created a level of tension between the students and herself. Tension came to a head when Jex-Blake expelled two sisters studying at the School without proper grounds. When the two sisters—Ina (Martha Georgina) and Grace Cadell—won the court case challenging their expulsion, the bad publicity meant that both the school and Jex-Blake herself lost support, and some students moved to Glasgow, London and Dublin; the only other places in Great Britain or Ireland where women could study medicine at that time. Elsie Inglis left the School and, with the help of her father John Inglis, Ina Cadell, and Grace Cadell, set up an alternative nearby: the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women. Jex-Blake wanted to be involved there too, but met resistance, while her relations with Leith Hospital were also becoming strained. The female students would soon be allowed to gain practical experience at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, previously blocked to them. In 1892, Scottish universities opened their doors to women. The ESMW continued for a few more years, advertising > \\"Science Classes for Ladies - separate classes in botany, zoology and > practical chemistry . . . Qualify for Arts and Science Graduation . . . > \\"Scotsman 25 April 1896 The school was never free of financial troubles. Jex-Blake applied for scholarships to support the institution, and The National Association for the Promoting of Medical Education for Women, along with some missionary organizations, helped fund the school. However, competition with the College of Medicine established by Inglis and the Cadell sisters was difficult, and in 1897 Jex-Blake herself was suffering from exhaustion. The following year the school closed, having educated about 80 women from Great Britain, India and elsewhere, with 33 of them completing the full course. Jessie Macgregor was one of those who stayed for the whole course, achieving distinctions in her examinations. For many years she practised medicine in partnership with Elsie Inglis, and later was a medical officer at the Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children. In December 1909, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, having decided to allow women to admit to their examinations, added the school to their list of recognised medical schools.

Toxicity HgSe is non-toxic as long as it is not ingested due to its insolubility. Toxic hydrogen selenide fumes can be evolved on exposure to acids. HgSe is a relatively stable compound which might mean that it is less toxic than elemental mercury or many organometallic mercury compounds.

It is a full-length recording of their performance on November 18, 1975 at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, during their Born to Run tours. It was first released as a DVD on November 14, 2005 as part of the Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition package, and then several months later on February 28, 2006 released as an audio CD. The album was reissued on vinyl for the first time for Record Store Day on April 22, 2017. Background The concert was part of Columbia Records' push to promote Springsteen in the UK and Europe following the success of his third album, Born to Run (1975) in the US. The large amount of publicity accompanying these appearances, especially the one in London, famously caused Springsteen to pull down from the front of the Odeon a promotional poster proclaiming \\"Finally London is ready for Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band.\\" \\"Bruce Springsteen: A Responsible Rocker,\\" Sunday Times, May 31, 1981\\"At last London was ready for Bruce Springsteen,\\" The Rock’n’Roll Routemaster, November 19, 2015 This performance marked the European concert debut of Springsteen and the E Street Band, kicking off a four-date mini-tour which also featured shows in Stockholm, Sweden and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as well as a second concert at the Hammersmith Odeon on November 24 that was added due to the huge ticket demand for the first London gig. In the liner notes, Springsteen himself writes that after the show had been recorded, \\"I'd paid no attention to it. I never looked at it ... for 30 years.\\" In his autobiography, Born to Run, he reveals that during and after the concert he experienced an angst-ridden sense of doubt as to performing in general, and his performance that evening in particular. However, in the same book, he recognizes that \\"whatever happened, that first night at the Hammersmith Odeon became one of our 'legendary' performances\\", despite calling the return gig on November 24 at the end of the European tour \\"a blaze of a show\\" by comparison. After The Rising Tour, Springsteen had an inkling to dig into film of the early part of his career, the vast majority of which remained \\"a blank spot,\\" with little or nothing ever released. He found the film and the 24-track audio recordings. The two-and-a-half-hour concert film was spliced together from 32 reels of silent 16-mm footage, digitally restored frame by frame in a painstaking process that took editor Thom Zimny a full year to complete. Bob Clearmountain, a veteran of several Springsteen projects, mixed the audio for the CD and film. Actor, writer and Monty Python member Michael Palin was in attendance and devoted an entire diary entry (dated Tuesday, November 18, 1975) to the concert and his first impression of Springsteen and the band. He notes that the hype by CBS Records was met with a certain scepticism by the ticket-buying public. He notes that the concert did not start until 45 minutes after the scheduled start time, that the PA system made it difficult for him to make out the lyrics, but Springsteen and the band \\"kept the evening alive – and he did three encores.\\"Michael Palin Diaries 1969–1979: The Python Years [2006] Contemporary and later reports seem to agree with Bruce Springsteen that the first performance on November 18 was in fact the inferior one, and was outshone by the repeat concert at the same venue on November 24 at the end of the European shows. This view may deem to have been borne out by the respective number of encores; three on November 18 and nine on November 24. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart on March 18, 2006 at number 93 with sales of approximately 12,000 copies sold. It spent two weeks on the chart. Hammersmith Odeon '75, with the exception of some songs on the Live/1975-85 box set, stands so far as the only full-length, official release that gives a snapshot of Springsteen and the E Street Band in concert at this early point in their musical career.

She achieved a public profile with her performances in the television play Cathy Come Home (1966) and the films Poor Cow (1967) and I'll Never Forget What's 'isname (1967), but alcoholism and drug abuse damaged her career, and from the early 1970s she worked infrequently. Life and career White, the daughter of a scrap merchant, was born in Hammersmith, London, and attended the Corona Stage Academy. She played minor roles in films from 1949 until the late 1950s, when she began to play more substantial supporting roles in films such as Carry on Teacher (1959) and Never Let Go (1960) in which she played the girlfriend of Peter Sellers. She continued working regularly, and drew attention for her performances in the television version of Nell Dunn's Up the Junction (1965). She followed this success with roles in Cathy Come Home (1966) and the films Poor Cow (1967), based on another Nell Dunn book, and I'll Never Forget What's'isname (1967). Up the Junction, Cathy Come Home and Poor Cow were all directed by Ken Loach. White starred opposite Alan Bates, Dirk Bogarde and Ian Holm in the film adaptation of Bernard Malamud's The Fixer (1968) and then travelled to Hollywood in 1968 to make Daddy's Gone A-Hunting (1969). She appeared in a Dean Martin western film, Something Big (1971), and had major roles in Dulcima (1971) and Made (1972), with the singer Roy Harper. During the late 1960s, White was considered one of the most promising actresses in British cinema, but her alcoholism and substance abuse, as well as unhappy relationships with male stars such as Richard Burton, Frank Sinatra, Oliver Reed and Paul Burke, hindered her career. She did, however, have a prominent role as a hostage in The Squeeze (1977). After living in Hollywood for several years, White returned to London to star in Nell Dunn's play Steaming at the West End's Comedy Theatre, filming Nutcracker at the same time. Despite receiving excellent reviews for Steaming, she was often late, missed performances, and was finally sacked. In 1981, a biography, Carol Comes Home, by Clifford Thurlow, was published.Thurlow, Clifford (1981) Carol Comes Home, New English Library Although White received publicity for the play and the biography, she was unable to revive her career. She returned to the United States, where she lived for the remainder of her life. Death White died in 1991 in Florida, at the age of 48. The cause of her death is disputed, with some sources claiming she took a drug overdose, and others (The Sunday Times in 1991 and Upton writing in 2004)Film star has liver failure Sunday Times, 15 September 1991Fallen Stars, Upton, Julian (2004), HeadpressFallen Stars at Google books Retrieved 9 October 2018 suggesting she succumbed to liver disease.

Various measures were made at the request of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) for environmentally friendly design measures. In its early years, the Sydney Super Dome used renewable energy for a fraction of its power supply, provided by EnergyAustralia's green power scheme. The venue saw use of green power through a deal with EnergyAustralia that lasted the duration of the 2000 Summer Olympics and the five years following. The Super Dome's power architecture includes 1,176 photovoltaic solar panels, installed on the arena's roof, which provide 10% of the venue's daily energy consumption, estimated at ~8612MWh annually. Energy efficient lighting and heating/cooling systems were also installed in the venue. The roof's drainage system consists over 2000m of high-density polyethylene pipes, in addition to nearly 3000m of cast iron and copper pipes used in the venue's plumbing system, and 1000m of vitrified clay pipes that make up the Super Dome's surrounding stormwater drainage system. The Super Dome was also one of many venues built at Sydney Olympic Park that made use of recycled timber, used to construct the exterior balconies of the venue.

The 3,500 capacity Apollo Stadium, which had been Adelaide's primary entertainment and indoor sports venue since 1969, was increasingly considered to be too small to meet this need and by the end of the 1980s many international music acts were bypassing Adelaide (especially in the winter months) on their Australian tours due to the lack of a suitable indoor venue (the only other viable indoor venues in Adelaide were the Adelaide Festival Centre or the Thebarton Theatre, both of which only held 2,000 which was even less than the Apollo's capacity). To meet the demand for a new indoor venue that could hold upwards of 10,000 people, the AEC was announced in late 1989 and would be built at a cost of AU$44 million. Building for the venue began in early 1990 and involved the excavation of 75,200 tonnes of earth and the pouring of 36,480 tonnes of concrete, the largest concrete pour in South Australia at the time, as well as over 750,000 hours on construction. The Main Arena floor is 65.4 metres by 42.1 metres and the roof height is approximately 20 metres from the Arena floor (approximately the height of a 5 storey building). The clear span of the Arena is 85 metres, the 8 roof trusses weighed a total of 216 tonnes and 980 tonnes of structural steel was used in the construction. The Adelaide Entertainment Centre was officially opened on 20 July 1991 by John Bannon, the then Premier of South Australia. Before the AEC was built it was generally believed by the people of Adelaide that it would also be the new home of the Adelaide 36ers who played in the National Basketball League as they played their home games at Apollo and a move there when it opened seemed natural as ticket demand for the 36ers was more than twice what the old stadium could hold. This speculation was also fueled by the success of other teams in the NBL, namely the Brisbane Bullets, Perth Wildcats, and Sydney Kings who had all moved into their respective cities larger Entertainment Centres and were attracting record crowds. However, both Basketball SA and the 36ers wanted their own venue that would provide a home for basketball in SA, and thus the AU$16 million, 8,000 seat Clipsal Powerhouse (Renamed to Titanium Security Arena, and then to Adelaide Arena in 2019) was opened in 1992. In 2019, the Adelaide 36ers announced that the Adelaide Entertainment Centre would be the new home of the Adelaide 36ers NBL team. The Adelaide Entertainment Centre has capacity to hold 10,000 Basketball fans. The South Australian Government assigned responsibility for the management of the AEC to the Grand Prix Board in 1989. In August 1998, the Government established the Adelaide Entertainments Corporation. The first Board of Directors for the AEC was formally appointed on 9 February 1999. The current Board consists of seven Directors. In 2007, the Rann Government announced plans to renovate the Adelaide Entertainment Centre. The Government released the statement: \\"The State Government is committed to the vision of creating a vibrant entertainment and media precinct on the Adelaide Entertainment Centre Site\\". On 6 August 2007, the renovation plans were passed and construction began on the $52 million upgrade. Tourism Minister Jane Lomax-Smith said: \\"the upgrade comes on the back of a record-breaking last 12 months, with more than 370,000 passing through the centre's doors, and record profits recorded.\\" The renovation included: major upgrades of the foyer, backstage area and corporate facilities; creation of additional car parking; new staging and curtains; renovation of administration areas; and restoration of the heritage-listed Revelations Chapel for use as a wedding and function venue. In the main arena itself 8,000 new seats were also installed. The centre not only holds music and cultural events, but hosts the occasional sporting event such as netball, as well as Professional Wrestling with the World Wrestling Entertainment using the venue for the Adelaide leg of their Australian tours since 2004. On 7 November 2010, the centre played host to the ANZ Championship grand final between local team the Adelaide Thunderbirds and the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic team from New Zealand. The Thunderbirds won the grand final 52-42 in front of 9,300 fans. The Entertainment Centre was chosen over the Thunderbirds home venue of ETSA Park which only holds 3,200 and their former alternate venue, Titanium Security Arena, due to its ability to hold more spectators and because ticket demand was more than the Titanium's 8,000 capacity. The centre also hosted the opening two games of the 2012 Holden Netball Quad-Series in a double header with Australia taking on England and New Zealand taking on South Africa. On 14 July 2013, the AEC hosted its second ANZ Championship grand final when the Thunderbirds hosted the Queensland Firebirds. The T-Birds kept their winning record at the venue when they defeated the Firebirds 50-48 in front of 9,000 fans. Since 2018, the Thunderbirds have utilised the Entertainment Centre as an alternate home venue. Kylie Minogue performed here for the first time on 25 and 26 April 2001, during her On A Night Like This. Minogue returned on 30 November and 1 December 2006 as part of her Homecoming Tour. Kylie performed again 18 June 2011 as part of her Aphrodite: Les Folies Tour and 17 March 2015 during her Kiss Me Once Tour. She will return on 11 March 2019, during her Golden Tour. On 23 July 2007, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for The Love Tour supporting their album The Love Album. On 4 October 2014, Miley Cyrus performed in the Entertainment Centre during the Bangerz Tour for the second time since her last sold out show in 2011 during her Gypsy Heart Tour. On 9 October 2018 Cher performed at this arena as part of her Here We Go Again Tour . After the centre's success, the number of regular plays and musicals decline in 2010s, as the Adelaide Festival Centre opposite the Adelaide Oval took over with musicals such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, The Sound Of Music and Matilda (shown in 2014, 2016 and 2017). Centre features Taylor Swift concert at the Centre in 2015. The footprint of the site is (approx 7 acres), and includes a large foyer area, a event arena, seven function rooms, car parking, logistic facilities and administrative offices. The arena is the largest auditorium in South Australia. The centre it is capable of operating in several different modes, including an 'intimate' mode (2,000–4,500 patrons), end stage mode (4,500–7,500 patrons) and '360-degree' mode. With a general admission floor and Corporate-level seating, the maximum capacity of the AEC of 11,300, making it the third-largest permanent indoor arena in Australia behind Sydney's Qudos Bank Arena (21,032) and the Brisbane Entertainment Centre (14,500), and the fifth-largest Australian arena behind the Sydney Super Dome (Qudos), Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena (16,200), the Perth Arena (14,856) and the Brisbane Entertainment Centre (both the Rod Laver and Perth arenas are retractable roof venues). The AEC has a complete in-house catering operation that provides for audience food and beverage requirements, as well as banquet, function, seminar, tradeshow, corporate suites and backstage requirements. The AEC also provides corporate hospitality in the form of 31 suites that are leased on a 2–5-year basis. Functions The Adelaide Entertainment Centre holds various functions throughout the year for corporate clients and private hirers including gala banquets, dinners, breakfasts, conferences, weddings and wedding ceremonies. The Arena can accommodate a banquet for up to 1000 guests. The AEC is also home to the Revelations Chapel which is heritage listed and non-denominational. This venue can host both wedding ceremonies and functions.  Car parks  The Adelaide Entertainment Centre has more than 1,400 car park spaces available on site for concert- goers. Entry or exit is via Mary Street, Manton Street or Adam Street only. A $15 parking fee applies for event parking.  Transport  A tram service operates from Glenelg via the Adelaide city centre, free of charge to and from the city. A taxi stand is situated on Port Road next to the main entrance of the AEC. Bus stops are located on Port Road and Manton Street (rear of the AEC). The Bowden railway station is located within a minute's walk from the main entrance of the AEC.

He also was a noted painter of portraits of fashionable women, which helped to bring him success in his own time.  Life  The Two Crowns, 1900 Dicksee's father, Thomas Dicksee, was a painter who taught Frank as well as his sister Margaret from a young age. The family lived in Fitzroy Square, Bloomsbury. Dicksee enrolled in the Royal Academy in 1870 and achieved early success. He was elected to the Academy in 1891 and became its President in 1924. \\"Francis Bernard Dicksee (1853–1928)\\" Phryne He was knighted in 1925, and named to the Royal Victorian Order by King George V in 1927. In 1921 Dicksee exhibited at the first exhibition of the Society of Graphic Art in London. Dicksee painted The Funeral of a Viking (1893; Manchester Art Gallery), which was donated in 1928 by Arthur Burton in memory of his mother to the Corporation of Manchester. Victorian critics gave it both positive and negative reviews, for its perfection as a showpiece and for its dramatic and somewhat staged setting, respectively. The painting was used by Swedish Viking/Black metal band Bathory for the cover of their 1990 album, Hammerheart. A book on Frank Dicksee's life and work with a full catalogue of his known paintings and drawings by Simon Toll was published by Antique Collector's Club in 2016.

It is structurally related to the proteinogenic α-amino acid L-arginine, the sole difference being the replacement of a methylene bridge (-\\\\- unit) in arginine with an oxa group (i.e., an oxygen atom) in canavanine. Canavanine is accumulated primarily in the seeds of the organisms which produce it, where it serves both as a highly deleterious defensive compound against herbivores and a vital source of nitrogen for the growing embryo (see also L-canaline). The mechanism of canavanine's toxicity is that organisms that consume it typically mistakenly incorporate it into their own proteins in place of L-arginine, thereby producing structurally aberrant proteins that may not function properly. The toxicity of canavanine may be enhanced under conditions of protein starvation, and canavanine toxicity, resulting from consumption of Hedysarum alpinum seeds with a concentration of 1.2% canavanine weight/weight, has been implicated in the death of a malnourished Christopher McCandless.Krakauer, J., et al. (2015). \\"Presence of l-canavanine in Hedysarum alpinum seeds and its potential role in the death of Christopher McCandless.\\" Wilderness & Environmental Medicine. (McCandless was the subject of Jon Krakauer's book (and subsequent movie) Into the Wild). Chemical structure of canavanine compared to arginine Some specialized herbivores tolerate L-canavanine either because they metabolize it efficiently (cf. L-canaline) or avoid its incorporation into their own nascent proteins. An example of this ability can be found in the larvae of the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens, which can tolerate massive amounts of dietary canavanine. These larvae fastidiously avoid incorporation of L-canavanine into their nascent proteins (presumably by virtue of highly discriminatory Arginine—tRNA ligase, the enzyme responsible for the first step in the incorporation of arginine into proteins). In contrast, larvae of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta can only tolerate tiny amounts (1.0 microgram per kilogram of fresh body weight) of dietary canavanine because their arginine-tRNA ligase has little, if any, discriminatory capacity. No one has examined experimentally the arginine-tRNA synthetase of these organisms. But comparative studies of the incorporation of radiolabeled L-arginine and L-canavanine have shown that in Manduca sexta, the ratio of incorporation is about 3 to 1. Dioclea megacarpa seeds contain high levels of canavanine. The beetle Caryedes brasiliensis is able to tolerate this however as it has the most highly discriminatory arginine-tRNA ligase known. In this insect, the level of radiolabeled L-canavanine incorporated into newly synthesized proteins is barely measurable. Moreover, this beetle uses canavanine as a nitrogen source to synthesize its other amino acids to allow it to develop. NZB/W F1, NZB, and DBA/2 mice fed L-canavanine develop a syndrome similar to systemic lupus erythematosus, while BALB/c mice fed a steady diet of protein containing 1% canavanine showed no change in lifespan. Alfalfa seeds and sprouts contain L-canavanine. The L-canavanine in alfalfa has been linked to lupus-like symptoms in primates, including humans, and other auto-immune diseases. Often stopping consumption reverses the problem.http://vegpeace.org/rawfoodtoxins.html See also * Canaline * Arginine  References   Bibliography  * * Category:Amino acids Category:Toxic amino acids Category:Non-proteinogenic amino acids Category:Plant toxins ","title":"Canavanine"},{"id":"4231033","text":"Yakup Ağa () or Ebu Yusuf Nurullah Yakub (), was the father of the Barbarossa Brothers, Oruç and Hızır.

Yakup became an established potter and purchased a boat to trade his products. The four sons helped their father with his business, but not much is known about his daughters. At first, Ishak, the eldest son, was involved with the financial affairs of the family business and remained on Mytilene. Hızır operated in the Aegean Sea and based his operations mostly in Salonica. The other two brothers Oruç and Ilyas soon became seamen engaging in sea trade, later turning privateers in the Mediterranean. When their vessel was captured by a Knights of St. John galley, Ilyas was killed during the battle and Oruç became a slave aboard the galley for two to three years. When he regained his freedom, he and his brother Hızir started engaging in piracy as corsairs entering history as the Barbarossa Brothers. They took part in many Ottoman campaigns around the Mediterranean and gained fame for their skill as commanders. Oruç and Ishak were killed in Oran (Algeria) during the battle for Tlemcen (Algeria) fighting the Spaniards. The last surviving son Hızır became one of the most famous Barbary pirates of his era and a legendary figure as Admiral of the Ottoman navy.

Description P. eryngii is the largest species in the oyster mushroom genus, Pleurotus, which also contains the oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus. It has a thick, meaty white stem and a small tan cap (in young specimens). Its natural range extends from the Atlantic Ocean through the Mediterranean Basin and Central Europe into Western Asia and India. Unlike other species of Pleurotus, which are primarily wood-decay fungi, the P. eryngii complex are also weak parasites on the roots of herbaceous plants, although they may also be cultured on organic wastes. Taxonomy Its species name is derived from the fact that it grows in association with the roots of Eryngium campestre or other Eryngium plants (English names: 'sea holly' or 'eryngo'). P. eryngii is a species complex, and a number of varieties have been described, with differing plant associates in the carrot family (Apiaceae). * P. eryngii var. eryngii (DC.) Quél 1872 – associated with Eryngium ssp. * P. eryngii var. ferulae (Lanzi) Sacc. 1887 – associated with Ferula communis * P. eryngii var. tingitanus Lewinsohn 2002 – associated with Ferula tingitana * P. eryngii var. elaeoselini Venturella, Zervakis & La Rocca 2000 – associated with Elaeoselinum asclepium * P. eryngii var. thapsiae Venturella, Zervakis & Saitta 2002 – associated with Thapsia garganica Other specimens of P. eryngii have been reported in association with plants in the genera Ferulago, Cachrys, Laserpitium, and Diplotaenia. Molecular studies have shown Pleurotus nebrodensis to be closely related to, but distinct from, P. eryngii. Pleurotus fossulatus may be another closely related species. Uses The mushroom has a good shelf life and is cultivated widely. It has little flavor or aroma when raw. When cooked, it develops typical mushroom umami flavors. Pleurotus eryngii may contain chemicals that stimulate the immune system. Dietary intake of Pleurotus eryngii may function as cholesterol-lowering dietary agent.

She served as the Minister for Health, Minister for Ambulance Services and Minister for the Coordination of Health and Human Services COVID-19 as well as Deputy Leader of the Government, but resigned these positions and from parliament on 26 September 2020 in the wake of criticism of her role in hotel quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Political career Mikakos in 2006 Mikakos was first elected as the Member for Jika Jika Province in the State of Victoria in September 1999. From 1999 until 2006, she represented the Legislative Council province of Jika Jika. Mikakos' electorate was abolished at the 2006 election as part of major reforms of the Legislative Council introduced after the 2002 election, but she won the second position on the Labor ticket for the replacement electorate, the larger, five-member Northern Metropolitan Region. She was first on the Labor ticket at the 2010, 2014 and 2018 elections. In Parliament, Mikakos held the roles of Parliamentary Secretary for Justice, Parliamentary Secretary for Planning, Shadow Minister for Community Services, Children, Youth Affairs, Youth Justice and Seniors and Ageing, Minister for Families and Children, Early Childhood Education and Youth Affairs, and Minister for Health and Ambulance Services. In March 2020, she was appointed Deputy Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council. In April 2020, Mikakos was appointed as the Minister for the Coordination of Health and Human Services COVID-19 as part of the Victorian Government's response to the coronavirus global pandemic. This appointment followed media coverage of comments which Mikakos made regarding a GP who tested positive for COVID-19 (see Controversies below). In Parliament, Mikakos voted against the human cloning bill but for stem cell research, for abortion decriminalisation, for assisted reproductive technology reforms and for dying with dignity laws. These bills were subject to conscience votes in the Labor Party. Mikakos is a member of Labor's left faction. Mikakos resigned as Minister for Health and from the Legislative Council on 26 September 2020.  Controversies  Misuse of taxpayer funds In 2003, Mikakos was criticised for nepotism after employing her sister Nikki in her taxpayer- funded electoral office. In 2005, Mikakos was forced to pay back taxpayer funds spent mailing Labor Party members on Parliamentary stationery for reelection support, which led to Premier Steve Bracks warning Labor MPs regarding the conduct. In 2014, Mikakos was again involved in applying taxpayer funds for political purposes, and the Victorian Ombudsman found that Mikakos was among a number of Labor MPs who had misused $388,000 in taxpayer funds for election campaigning. Mikakos declined to be interviewed by police in connection with the affair, which became known as the \\"red shirts rort\\".https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-14/no-mps-charged-over-victorian- alp-red-shirts-scandal/10795058 The Labor party later repaid the amount.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/14/victorian-labor- mps-exonerated-in-red-shirts-election-rorts-scheme Youth justice In 2016, a number of criminals under the age of 18 in custody at Parkville prison engaged in a violent riot and caused significant property damage, forcing staff to flee. Mikakos, then the Minister for Youth Affairs, was criticised for losing control of youth justice. Later, Mikakos illegally moved the relevant inmates to an adult prison, and was forced to reverse that decision by the Supreme Court of Victoria. Remarks in Parliament In 2018, Mikakos was suspended from Parliament for a day after accusing Liberal MPs of racism. Suspension involves forfeiture of the member's salary for the day. Handling of the COVID-19 pandemic Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Mikakos was criticised for attacking a Melbourne GP who attended work after travelling to the United States. The Minister stated that she was 'flabbergasted' a doctor with 'flu-like symptoms' had presented to work, despite the GP not meeting her own departmental guidelines for testing. The Minister was criticised for inaccuracies, violating patient privacy and maligning frontline health workers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had- coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies but refused to apologise.https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health- minister-wont-apologise-for-flabbergasted-coronavirus-comment-towards-dr- chris-higgins/news-story/cedd00e3e8e510c0e5faee0c7b5ccabd Later, in April 2020, Mikakos was involved in controversy when she defended a comparison between COVID-19 and Captain Cook.https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/politics/coronavirus-victorian- health-officers-captain-cook-or-virus-tweet-sparks-outrage/news- story/f3a545406b8515bc8bf23ff982402d76 In June 2020, a breakdown in hotel quarantine procedures created a second wave of COVID-19 cases in Victoria, leading to the first total lockdown of residents in homes in Australia,https://www.afr.com/politics/victoria-public-housing-towers-locked- down-20200704-p5590j panic buying,https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/pm/victoria-calls-in-the-army- and-panic-buying-returns/12389734 and military personnel called in.https://thewest.com.au/news/coronavirus/coronavirus-crisis-military-called- in-as-cases-surge-in-victoria- ng-b881589071zhttps://www.sbs.com.au/news/gladys-berejiklian-says-don-t- interact-with-people-from-melbourne-as-victoria-records-17-more-coronavirus- cases The resurgence occurred despite a report from experts a month earlier warning of an opportunity to prevent a further outbreak; Mikakos claimed she was unsure whether her government had received a copy of the reporthttps://www.smh.com.au/national/man-dies-of-coronavirus-20-new-cases- and-surge-in-replication-rate-in-victoria-20200624-p555kb.html and attempted to distance herself from the scandal.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-03/victoria-coronavirus-cases- rise-by-66/12419538 In August 2020, Mikakos was stripped of responsibility for hotel quarantine. In August 2020, Mikakos was criticised for providing inadequate and insufficient PPE to hospital staff. Mikakos claimed that only 10-15% of healthcare workers with COVID-19 became infected through their workplace, and the government was later forced to correct that figure to 70-80%.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-20/questions-over-coronavirus- figures-victorian-healthcare- workers/12572982?nw=0https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-25/health-workers- covid-coronavirus-case-numbers-victoria/12582468 Beginning in March 2020, Mikakos resisted calls to resign for her handling of the pandemic, including from the medical profession, the opposition, and the disgraced Health Workers Union (which changed its name from a branch of the Health Services Union following scandals).https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-08/coronavirus-gp- chris-higgins-hits-back-at-health- minister/12036910https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-09/coronavirus-victorian- health-minister-jenny-mikakos- twitter/12538844https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-24/hwu-calls-for- victorian-health-minister-jenny-mikakos-to- resign/12696806https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/factional-games-at- play-in-health-union-s-call-to-sack-jenny-mikakos-20200924-p55yue.html In August 2020, Mikakos was criticised for declining to answer questions in Parliament and for failing to meet Parliamentary deadlines to provide promised written responses to questions.https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/arrogant-mikakos- refuses-to-answer-questions-as-liberal-mp-posts-crude- attack-20200805-p55isi.html She stated that she was declining to answer questions relating to the breakdown of hotel quarantine until a result came out of the independent inquiry led by former Justice Jennifer Coate. Justice Coate announced that the inquiry did not prevent any person from commenting publicly or answering questions on the matters covered by the inquiry.https://www.quarantineinquiry.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-08/Transcript%20of%20extraordinary%20sitting%205%20August%202020.pdf at P-16 Under the convention of individual ministerial responsibility in the Westminster system, Ministers are expected to be accountable to Parliament, including by answering questions, and to resign for major failures in their department regardless of whether they were aware of them. On 24 September 2020, Mikakos appeared before the board of inquiry into the hotel quarantine program, where she stated that she had not made the decision to use private security contractors to manage the quarantine program, and had not been aware of the arrangement until an outbreak at a Melbourne hotel became apparent in mid-May. Footage emerged of Mikakos at a media briefing on 29 March with jobs minister Martin Pakula as he announced that security guards would be used to patrol hotels, and media also reported that the premier's office had sent a briefing note to caucus outlining this arrangement. Mikakos tendered a supplementary statement on 25 September, denying that she had misled the inquiry and reiterating that she had no recollection of the matters raised. Premier Daniel Andrews faced the inquiry on 25 September, at which he stated that he regarded Mikakos as \\"accountable\\" for the program. The following day, Mikakos resigned from cabinet. Mikakos made a statement suggesting that the reason for her resignation was that she disagreed with \\"elements\\" of the Premier's statement, and was no longer able to serve in his cabinet. Personal life Jenny Mikakos attended the private Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar School and the University of Melbourne, where she obtained arts and law degrees. Before her election to Parliament, Mikakos worked as a commercial and tax lawyer at top-tier accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand and law firm King & Wood Mallesons, as well as Jerrard & Stuk. She was briefly a Councillor with the City of Northcote in the early 1990s.

Principle In machine learning, the goal is to train a system to minimize a cost function or (referring to ALOPEX) a response function. Many training algorithms, such as backpropagation, have an inherent susceptibility to getting \\"stuck\\" in local minima or maxima of the response function. ALOPEX uses a cross-correlation of differences and a stochastic process to overcome this in an attempt to reach the absolute minimum (or maximum) of the response function. Method ALOPEX, in its simplest form is defined by an updating equation: \\\\Delta\\\\ W_{ij}(n) = \\\\gamma\\\\ \\\\Delta\\\\ W_{ij}(n-1) \\\\Delta\\\\ R(n) + r_i(n) Where: *n \\\\geq 0 is the iteration or time-step. *\\\\Delta\\\\ W_{ij}(n) is the difference between the current and previous value of system variable \\\\ W_{ij} at iteration n . *\\\\Delta\\\\ R(n) is the difference between the current and previous value of the response function \\\\ R, at iteration n . *\\\\gamma is the learning rate parameter (\\\\gamma\\\\ < 0 minimizes R, and \\\\gamma\\\\ > 0 maximizes R \\\\ ) *r_i(n) \\\\sim\\\\ N(0,\\\\sigma\\\\ ^2) Discussion Essentially, ALOPEX changes each system variable W_{ij}(n) based on a product of: the previous change in the variable \\\\DeltaW_{ij}(n-1), the resulting change in the cost function \\\\DeltaR(n), and the learning rate parameter \\\\gamma. Further, to find the absolute minimum (or maximum), the stochastic process r_{ij}(n) (Gaussian or other) is added to stochastically \\"push\\" the algorithm out of any local minima.

Weinrich was the son of a shoe manufacturer. After attending elementary school and technical school, he joined the Prussian army in 1906, where he worked in administration. During the First World War he was employed in an army provisions office in Germany. After the war, Weinrich worked in a government supply office from 1920, first in Cologne and from 1920 in Landau in the Bavarian Palatinate, where he also became a member of the Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund, a large anti-Semitic, völkisch organization. In February 1922 Weinrich joined the Nazi Party and founded local groups first in Landau and later in Kassel. After the ban on the party was lifted, he rejoined it in February 1925 (membership number 24,291). He became an Ortsgruppenleiter (Local Leader) in Kassel and from 1925 to 1927 was Deputy Gauleiter and Gau Treasurer. On 1 February 1928 he became Acting Gauleiter of Gau Hessen-Nassau Nord, succeeding Walter Schultz, and was named permanent Gauleiter in September. The Gau was renamed Gau Kurhessen on 1 January 1934.https://rpb.lbz-rlp.de/cgi- bin/wwwalleg/srchrnam.pl?db=rnam&recnums;=0007435 From 1929 to 1933 he was a City Councilor in Kassel. From October 14, 1930 to 1933 he was a member of the Landtag of Prussia. He was also a member of the Hessen-Nassau Provincial Parliament and the Kassel Municipal Parliament. In 1933-34 he was the Deputy Authorized Representative of the Province of Hesse-Nassau to the Reichsrat. From 11 July 1933 to 1945 he was a member of the Prussian State Council. From 12 November 1933 to 1945, he was a member of the Reichstag for electoral constituency 19, Hesse-Nassau. A member of the National Socialist Motor Corps (Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), he reached the rank of NSKK- Obergruppenführer on 30 January 1939. On 16 November 1942, he was appointed the Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau. Shortly after the air raid on Kassel of 22 October 1943, which destroyed the entire city center, Weinrich was charged him with failing in Kassel's war preparations and abandoning the city during the bombing. He was initially placed on leave and then removed from his post as Gauleiter on 6 November 1943. His successor was Karl Gerland, then the Deputy Gauleiter in Reichsgau Lower Danube. After the war ended, Weinrich was interned in the Eselheide internment camp from 1945 to 1950. On July 6, 1949, he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment by the Kassel Chamber of Justice as one of the main culprits of the Nazi (later reduced to six or seven years, sources differ). In November 1950 he was released, in consideration of time already served. From Kassel he moved to Trendelburg, then to Hausen near Offenbach am Main and finally back to Kassel at the beginning of the 1960s. He died on 22 July 1973.

The area is close to junctions of the M62 and A1(M) motorways; as well as junctions on the rail network, including northward to York, south to Pontefract (and Rotherham), west to both Wakefield and Leeds, east to Goole and south-east to the East Coast Main Line; the River Aire meets the Aire and Calder navigation close to the east of the town. The area is famous for the power station and the M62 services which offers a Burger King, an M&S; Simply Food, a Cotton Traders, a WH Smiths, a Greggs, and a Travelodge. Ferrybridge Power Station to the north dominates the skyline around the village. The village The Golden Lion Pub The village has two public houses; \\"The Golden Lion\\" which sits by Ferrybridge lock and is steeped in colourful history during its time as a coaching Inn and \\"The Magnet Inn\\". The village has two primary schools one of which is in the top 250 schools in the country, The Vale Academy was described as \\"outstanding\\" in a 2013 Ofsted report. The other, Willow Green Academy, (previously known as Roundhill Junior School and Ferrybridge Infant School). History Housing in Ferrybridge An archaeological feature at Ferrybridge is Ferrybridge Henge, a prehistoric ceremonial monument dating back to the Neolithic period, constructed during the period 4,500-1,500 BC, additionally a 2,400-year-old chariot burial has been discovered in the area. The history of Ferrybridge - and its neighbour, Knottingley - dates back to the establishment of Anglo-Saxon settlements along this stretch of the river. The respective histories of the two settlements of Ferrybridge and Knottingley are closely linked, bringing glassmaking, shipbuilding, brewing and potteries to the area. Airedale Methodist Church Ferrybridge stands where the Great North Road crosses the River Aire. In 1198, a bridge was built over the river. The first recorded crossings of the river at Ferrybridge date from the bridge's construction. [In 1228 the bridge collapsed, resulting in the drowning of crusaders passing over at the time. See Christopher Tyerman How To Plan A Crusade (2017), p. 182, citing Calendar of Close Rolls 1227–31, p. 34-35.] The bridge was rebuilt at the end of the 14th century with seven pillars and a chantry chapel at one end. Until 1810, a toll was payable to cross the bridge. In March 1461, on the eve of the battle of nearby Towton, an engagement between the Lancastrians and Yorkists ended in a Lancastrian victory, and Lord Fitzwalter, the Yorkist leader was killed. This is known as the Battle of Ferrybridge. Up to the end of the 17th century, Knottingley was an important inland port in the West Riding as the River Aire was not navigable beyond it. The construction of the Aire and Calder Navigation Canal (by a 1699 Act of Parliament; this was the first navigation scheme passed by Act of Parliament) diminished Knottingley's importance as a port by allowing barges on the river to navigate further upstream to Leeds. Parliament authorized a new canal in 1820. Cutting through the centre of Knottingley, the new Aire and Calder Navigation Canal was opened in 1826 and connected the new port of Goole with the River Aire at Ferrybridge. The lock at Ferrybridge opened at 10 a.m. on 20 July 1826. Ferrybridge ‘C’ Power Station By the end of the Industrial Revolution, Ferrybridge had become a centre for glass production. The Ferrybridge railway station opened in 1882 on the Swinton and Knottingley Joint Railway (1879) and closed in 1965. In the 20th century, three power stations were built, all on the same site - the first in the 1920s, the second in the 1950s, and the third, Ferrybridge 'C' Power Station, in the 1960s; three of the latter's cooling towers collapsed during construction in high winds in 1965 (see Ferrybridge power stations).

Indication Surgery is indicated in patients with pulmonary artery emboli that are surgically accessible. Thrombi are usually the cause of recurrent/chronic pulmonary emboli and therefore of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) (pulmonary hypertension).Pulmonary endarterectomy: Part II. Operation, anesthetic management, and postoperative care. Banks DA, Pretorius GV, Kerr KM, Manecke GR Semin Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 2014 Dec;18(4):331–40. Epub 2014 Jul 7. Indeed, PTE is the only definitive treatment option currently available for CTEPH.Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Fedullo P, Kerr KM, Kim NH, Auger WR Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011;183(12):1605. Due to the nature of the procedure patients with significant hemodynamic or ventilation complications or impairments may be unable to undergo PTE. Description of the surgery A PTE has significant risk; mortality for the operation is typically 5%, but less in centers with high volume and experience. Individuals with favorable hemodynamic risk profiles also demonstrate lower mortality rates (1.3%). PTEs are risky because of the nature of the procedure. PTEs involve a full cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), deep hypothermia and cardioplegia (a crystalline fluid which stops the heart from beating). Actual removal of the embolus is carried out in a standstill operation (deep hypothermia and periods of cessation of circulation). There are a number of reasons why these high risk elements of the procedure are necessary. CPB is needed to divert blood from the heart and lungs and supply the body with oxygen and blood while the pulmonary vasculature is operated on. Cardioplegia is initiated as the approach to the pulmonary arteries is performed through the pericardium, a fibrous sack surrounding the heart. Furthermore, movement from the heart makes delicate work on the closely attached pulmonary arteries complex. Hypothermia is necessary as the embolus is very delicate and the risk of disruption is high, in order to appropriately visualize the clot and remove it a bloodless field is required. Clot visualization is achieved through dissection of the pulmonary arteries which is technically challenging. If possible the clot is removed in a single piece to avoid the formation of mobile emboli. In order to achieve this CPB is periodically stopped, resulting in a complete cessation of blood circulation. This is only feasible if the patient is hypothermic (cooled to 18-20C) as metabolism is slowed and the body can better tolerate the resulting lack of blood supply.Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Fedullo P, Kerr KM, Kim NH, Auger. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011;183(12):1605. Circulatory arrest is limited to 20 minute intervals to protect brain function. Typically an experienced surgeon can perform an entire unilateral procedure in this time. After each interval of arrest circulation is continued for 10 minutes or until pulmonary venous oxygen saturation is at least 90%.Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Fedullo P, Kerr KM, Kim NH, Auger WR. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011;183(12):1605. Bypass time is typically 345 minutes. There are emerging alternative options available that seek to limit neurologic complications resulting from hypothermia and circulatory arrest. Currently these options have not been shown to be superior to the previously described technique. They include use of moderate hypothermia, antegrade cerebral artery perfusion without total circulatory arrest, and negative pressure application to the left ventricle.Technical advances of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Hagl C, Khaladj N, Peters T, Hoeper MM, Logemann F, Haverich A, Macchiarini P. Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2003;23(5):776.

Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2008;34(1):159. Epub 2008 Jun 12. It is important to note that acute pulmonary embolectomy is a dramatically different procedure. Its is typically performed without hypothermia as the structure of the clot is different, and the emergent nature presents different operative priorities. Recovery and Complications Recovery from this procedure can be complex. Thoracic surgery, CBP and cardioplegia are associated with their own complications and management challenges, as is hypothermia. Specifically, endartectomy is associated with reperfusion pulmonary edema and \\"pulmonary artery steal.\\" Reperfusion pulmonary edema occurs in up to 30% of patients and is a result of changes in permeability to the vascular endothelium. Management of this condition may require the use of supportive ventilation including BiPAP (bidirectional positive airway pressure) and fluid management with diuretics. In patients who are non responsive to this management extra corporeal circulation may be indicated. Each of these strategies are complex and require careful consideration of patient physiology.Reperfusion pulmonary edema after pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy. Levinson RM, Shure D, Moser KM. Am Rev Respir Dis. 1986;134(6):1241. Pulmonary artery steal occurs in 70% of patients. It is related to changes in blood flow over areas of pulmonary vasculature that have been newly exposed from the endarectomy. The result is insufficient oxygenation though the mechanism causing this remains obscure. Treatment is supportive with oxygen, and ventilation, and the condition is typically self limiting.Resolution of vascular steal after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Moser KM, Metersky ML, Auger WR, Fedullo PF. Chest. 1993;104(5):1441. Pulmonary vascular steal in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Olman MA, Auger WR, Fedullo PF, Moser KM. Chest. 1990;98(6):1430. Post-surgery The benefits of PTEs are significant. Most patients after surgery no longer suffer from shortness of breath and therefore have a much improved quality of life. Further, pulmonary vascular resistance usually drops back to close normal levels. Since the pulmonary resistance is proportional to the pressure driving the pulmonary flow (P = Q \\\\cdot R), it follows that the pulmonary pressure decreases. This in turn means that the work per time (power) decreases because it is equal to the pressure gradient times the volumetric flow, which in this case is the cardiac output. As a result of the operation, patients are spared from pulmonary hypertension and further right ventricular hypertrophy. Most pleasing is that patients who previously had right heart dysfunction often recover function. History and development The UCSD Medical Center's cardiothoracic surgery department, led by Stuart W. Jamieson, is widely recognized as a pioneer in the relatively new surgery, having performed more PTEs than the rest of the world combined (over 3000 since 1970 out of a total of 4500 worldwide) with the lowest mortality rate. In the UK, PTE is offered only at one centre, Royal Papworth Hospital, led by surgeon Mr David Jenkins. He is one of just four surgeons in the UK qualified to perform pulmonary endarterectomy surgery, all based at Royal Papworth, which is one of the most active centres in the world for this operation with approximately 190 operations performed each year and a total caseload since 1996 of more than 2,000. The operation features in a BBC Two documentary called 'Surgeons: At the Edge of Life', broadcast on Tuesday 6 October 2020. The footage shows the patient's entire body being drained of blood and cooled to 20 degrees Celsius - half the normal temperature - in order to enable the surgery to occur. Relation to pulmonary thrombectomies PTEs and pulmonary thrombectomies are both operations that removed thrombus from the lung's arterial vasculature. Aside from this similarity they differ in many ways. *PTEs are done on a nonemergency basis while pulmonary thrombectomies are typically done as an emergency procedure. *PTEs typically are done using hypothermia and full circulatory arrest. *PTEs are done for chronic pulmonary embolism, thrombectomies for severe acute pulmonary embolism. *PTEs are generally considered a very effective treatment, surgical thrombectomies are an area of some controversy and their effectiveness a matter of some debate in the medical community.

Biography Kangrga was born in Zagreb, where he attended elementary and grammar school. In 1950, he graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb, where he commenced his work as a teaching assistant working in the fields of ethics and aesthetics. Between 1962 and 1964, he studied in Heidelberg, Germany. He became a tenured professor in 1972 and he held this position until his retirement in 1993. Kangrga started his confrontation with the Yugoslav communist leadership during his undergraduate studies in February 1948, before the clash of Joseph Broz Tito with Joseph Stalin. Then, he published his first philosophical article entitled On Ethics in Studentski list (Zagreb), which the League of Communists of Yugoslavia bureaucrats found provoking. In 1953, Kangrga became a member of the LCY but in 1954 he was expelled from the party because he announced that he was inspired to become a communist by the works of Miroslav Krleža, who still wasn't wholly rehabilitated by the regime. In 1964, Kangrga was one of the founders of the journal Praxis. Together with Rudi Supek, he has established the Korčula Summer School, which was a unique meeting place for philosophers from the East and the West between 1964 and 1974. It is around these two institutions that the Praxis school took shape. The defining features of the school were: 1) emphasis on the writings of young Marx; and 2) call for freedom of speech in both East and West based upon Marx's insistence on ruthless critique of everything existent. Milan Kangrga emphasized creativity as well, but also the understanding of human beings as producers humanizing nature. While he was critical of the Communist party in Yugoslavia, mainly for not implementing self-management socialism, he rejected non-Socialist reactions against SFR Yugoslavia, the most notable one being the Croatian Spring. Milan Kangrga has lectured in Bonn, Munich, Prague, Budapest, Moscow, and Kiev among other cities. His articles have been published in Germany, Italy, the United States, France, Spain, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Mexico. Major works Kangrga has published 15 books.

Life Hornsby became a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1760. He occupied the Savilian Chair of Astronomy at Oxford University from 1763. In the same year, he became Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy. Hornsby was especially concerned with the observation of the transit of Venus. In 1761, he observed the transit of Venus from Shirburn Castle, in Oxfordshire, the seat of the Earl of Macclesfield. George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield (ca. 1695-1764), celebrated as an astronomer, had spent most of his time conducting astronomical observations at Shirburn Castle; here he had built an observatory and a chemical laboratory. Despite the international efforts made to observe the 1761 transit, poor weather conditions hampered observations. In 1766 Hornsby informed the Royal Society that preparations needed to begin for the 1769 transit, his publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society focusing attention on the \\"cone of visibility\\" indicating some of the better places to observe the transit. Hornsby himself viewed the 1769 transit at the Tower of the Five Orders, where the Bodleian Library is situated. In the periodical Philosophical Transactions, Hornsby published a comparative analysis of 1761 transit (1763); a plan for suitable viewing stations for 1769, including possible locations in the Pacific (1765); a description of organising and reporting observing groups in Oxford (1769); and a comparative analysis of the 1769 transit (1771). Hornsby was instrumental in the establishment of the Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford in 1772, and was made Radcliffe Observer in the same year. In 1782, he was appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy. In 1783, he became Radcliffe Librarian. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788. Hornsby made tens of thousands of astronomical observations. These were not published, however, until 1932, and were donated to Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1935. They include a determination of the rate of change of the axial inclination of the Earth and the proper motion of Arcturus, both close to the modern values, whose combination of visual magnitude and large proper motion led Hornsby to argue (incorrectly) that \\"We may, I think, fairly conclude that Arcturus is the nearest Star to our System visible in this Hemisphere\\". The crater Hornsby on the Moon is named after him. N.B. His death announcement in the Kentish Gazette 24 April 1810 quotes his death as \\"Wednesday (11th Apr. 1810) at the Observatory Oxford, aged 76, the Rev. Thomas Hornsby D.D. & F.R.S.

Karl Gerland (14 July 1905 in Gottsbüren – 21 April 1945) was a Nazi Gauleiter of Kurhessen and Oberpräsident of the Prussian Province of Kurhessen. On 21 April 1945 Gerland was killed during the fighting against the Soviet Red Army at Frankfurt (Oder). Biography Gerland was born in Gottsbüren (now a part of Trendelburg) near Kassel. He joined the Nazi Party in 1929. As of 1930, he was district leader in Kreis Hofgeismar, and beginning in 1932, he was acting propaganda leader in the Gau of Kurhessen. From 1933 he was leader of the provincial post in Kurhessen of the Propagandaministerium and worked as office leader from October 1934 in the Party Chancellery. In March 1936, Gerland was elected a member of the Reichstag, and from 1 June 1938 until November 1943, he was Deputy Gauleiter in Reichsgau Niederdonau. In November 1943, he became an SS Brigadeführer. From 6 November 1943, Gerland served as Gauleiter in Kurhessen. He succeeded the former Gauleiter Karl Weinrich, who had been removed from his post for abandoning the city of Kassel during an air raid on 22 October. Gerland served as acting Gauleiter from 6 November 1943 until being named permanent on 13 December 1944. From 1 July 1944 Gerland was also Oberpräsident ('High President') of the newly formed Prussian Province of Kurhessen. Previously it had been part of the Province of Hesse-Nassau. Gerland thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the province. On 1 August 1944 he was promoted to SS- Gruppenführer. In the spring of 1945 Gerland received high praise from Joseph Goebbels. In his diary entry of 2 April 1945 Goebbels noted that Gerland was conducting himself \\"superbly,\\" adding, \\"I would have expected this from [him] anyway.\\" On 21 April, Gerland was killed at Frankfurt (Oder) during fighting on the Eastern Front.

Considered a landmark of avant-garde cinema,\\"Few filmmakers have had as large an impact on the recent avant-garde film scene as Canadian Michael Snow, whose Wavelength is probably the most frequently discussed 'structural' film.\\" Scott MacDonald, \\"So Is This by Michael Snow\\" Film Quarterly Vol. 39, No. 1 (Autumn, 1985): 34. it was filmed over one week in December 1966 and edited in 1967,P. Adams Sitney, Visionary Film: The American Avant-Garde 1943-1978. New York: Oxford University Press, 1979 p. 375 and is an example of what film theorist P. Adams Sitney describes as \\"structural film\\",Sitney pp. 368-397 calling Snow \\"the dean of structural filmmakers.\\"Sitney p. 374 Wavelength is often listed as one of the greatest underground, art house and Canadian films ever made. It was named #85 in the 2001 Village Voice critics' list of the 100 Best Films of the 20th Century. The film has been designated and preserved as a masterwork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada. In a 1969 review of the film published in Artforum, Manny Farber describes Wavelength as \\"a pure, tough 45 minutes that may become The Birth of a Nation in Underground films, is a straightforward document of a room in which a dozen businesses have lived and gone bankrupt. For all of the film's sophistication (and it is overpowering for its time-space-sound inventions) it is a singularly unpadded, uncomplicated, deadly realistic way to film three walls, a ceiling and a floor... it is probably the most rigorously composed movie in existence.\\"Reprinted in Manny Farber, Negative Space: Manny Farber on the Movies, London: Studio Vista, 1971, p. 250 Synopsis Wavelength consists of almost no action, and what action does occur is largely elided. If the film could be said to have a conventional plot, this would presumably refer to the four \\"character\\" scenes. Snow's intent for the film was \\"a summation of my nervous system, religious inklings and aesthetic ideas\\". The 45-minute-long zoom–which nonetheless contains edits–that incorporates in its time frame four human events in the room, including a man's death and a woman calling emergency later on, is intended to be symbolic of his intent.Robert Enright, \\"The Lord of Missed Rules: An Interview with Michael Snow\\" Border Crossings v. 26 no. 2 (May 2007): 22 In the first scene, a woman in a fur coat enters the room accompanied by two men carrying a bookshelf or cabinet. The woman instructs the men where to place this piece of furniture and they all leave. Later, the same woman returns with a female friend. They drink the beverages they have brought, and turn on the radio, which is playing \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" by the Beatles. Long after they leave, what sounds like breaking glass is heard. At this point, a man (played by filmmaker Hollis Frampton) enters and inexplicably, although in a way to indicate his death, collapses on the floor. Later on, the woman in the fur coat reappears and makes an emergency phone call, speaking, with strange calm, about the dead man in her apartment whom she has never seen before. Around the end of the film, one can hear what sound like police sirens, but could just as well be a part of the musical score, a distinct piece of minimalist music that pairs tones at random. These tones shift in frequency (and in \\"wavelength\\"), becoming higher- pitched as the camera further analyzes the space of the anonymous apartment. What begins as a view of the full apartment zooms (the zoom is not precisely continuous as the camera does change angle slightly, noticeably near the very end) and changes focus slowly across the forty-five minutes, only to stop and come into perfect focus on a photograph of the sea on the wall. The film ends with the camera going completely out of focus and fading to white, as the soundtrack finally raises to a pitch too high to be heard. Cast * Hollis Frampton * Lyne Grossman * Naoto Nakazawa * Roswell Rudd * Amy Taubin * Joyce Wieland * Amy Yadrin Structural film Still from film According to P. Adams Sitney, the trend in American avant-garde cinema during the late 1940s and 1950s (such as the work of Maya Deren and Stan Brakhage) was towards \\"increased complexity\\".Sitney, p. 369 Since the mid-1960s, filmmakers such as Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, Paul Sharits, Tony Conrad and Joyce Wieland produced works where simplicity was foregrounded. Sitney labeled this tendency \\"structural film.\\" The four characteristics of structural film are \\"fixed camera position…the flicker effect, loop printing, and rephotography off the screen.\\"Sitney, p. 370 Sitney describes Snow as the \\"dean of structural film- makers\\" who \\"utilizes the tension\\" of Wavelength's use of a \\"fixed-frame and…the flexibility of the fixed tripod\\". Where Sitney describes structural film as a \\"working process,\\" Stephen Heath in Questions of Cinema finds Wavelength \\"seriously wanting\\" in that the \\"implied…narrative [makes Wavelength] in some ways a retrograde step in cinematic form\\".Stephen Heath, Questions of Cinema, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981, p. 166 To Heath, the principal theme of Wavelength is the \\"question of the cinematic institution of the subject of film\\" rather than the apparatus of filmmaking itself.Heath, p. 129 In 2003, Snow released WVLNT (or Wavelength For Those Who Don't Have the Time), a shorter (1/3 of the original time) and significantly altered version by overlaying multiple forms of the original film upon itself.\\"The density of Wavelength is foregrounded in Snow's own 'preemptive' digital version of the film, WVLNT or Wavelength For Those Who Don't Have the Time (2003), which divides the film into thirds and superimposes them into a fifteen-minute short.

Michael Zryd, \\"Avant-Garde Films: Teaching Wavelength.\\" Cinema Journal 47, Number 1 (Fall 2007): 111-112. Critical reception The screening of Wavelength in 1967 was, according to filmmaker Jonas Mekas, \\"a landmark event in cinema.\\"Enright, 23 Considered a canonical avant-garde film along with Léger and Murphy's Ballet mecanique (1924), Buñuel and Dalí's Un chien andalou (1929), Maya Deren's Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), Stan Brakhage's Mothlight (1963) and Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising (1964),Michael Zryd, \\"Avant-Garde Films: Teaching Wavelength\\" Cinema Journal Vol. 47 Issue 1 (Fall 2007): 111 Wavelength's 45-minute running time nevertheless contributes to a reputation for being a difficult work:Zryd, 110 > [G]iven the film's durational strategy, we feel every minute of the time it > takes to traverse the space of the loft to get to the infinite space of the > photograph of waves—and the fade to white—at the film's end.

The film won the Grand Prix at the 1967 Knokke Experimental Film Festival, Knokke, Belgium. and in a 1968 Film Quarterly review, Jud Yalkut describes Wavelength as \\"at once one of the simplest and one of the most complex films ever conceived.\\"Jud Yalkut, \\"Wavelength by Michael Snow\\" Film Quarterly Vol. 21, No. 4 (Summer, 1968): 50 In a 1968 L.A. Free Press review of the film, Gene Youngblood describes Wavelength as \\"without precedent in the purity of its confrontation with the essence of cinema: the relationships between illusion and fact, space and time, subject and object. It is the first post- Warhol, post-Minimal movie; one of the few films to engage those higher conceptual orders which occupy modern painting and sculpture. It has rightly been described as a triumph of contemplative cinema.'\\" Wavelength ranked 102nd in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made, and also received three directors' votes.

UAJY is one of the 50 most promising university and one of the best six universities in Indonesia in quality assurance according to Directorate of Higher Education, Department of National Education. History The university was established on 27 September 1965 by the Yogyakarta branch of the Atma Jaya Catholic University Institute of Indonesia. The founders were R.A. Soehardi, A.J. Liem Sioe Siet A., Sutijoso, Oey Liang Lee and Leo Sukoto. Originally an extension of the Universitas Atma Jaya in Jakarta, it became an independent university under the auspices of the Slamet Rijadi Foundation on 31 August 1973. The university borrowed classrooms from the IKIP (Teaching and Education Institute) Sanata Dharma, now the Universitas Sanata Dharma, until its own campus buildings, at Mrican Baru Street, were finished in 1980. Growing student numbers led to the Faculty of Engineering and the Administration department being moved to a new building in Babarsari Road in 1990, in conjunction with the celebrations of the silver anniversary of the founding of the university. In 1995, the Economics Faculty and the Postgraduate Program moved into a new building beside the existing building in Babarsari Road. In 2005 a new building was built adjacent to the Faculty of Engineering and the Administration department to host the Faculty of Social and Political Science. The University also acquired the former BHS Bank building to host administrative department. An integrated four-story library was built next to the Faculty of Social and Political Science building. It will host library and Information Systems Center. The library building officially opened in a Mass led by Mgr. Ignatius Suharyo (archbishop) in October 2009. In late 2010, a project for a new building was started. It was planned as an addition to the Faculty of Social and Political Science Building. The newer building is on the east of the current building. Faculties #Engineering Dean Prof. Ir.

The stadium was located west of Curson Avenue, surrounded by Beverly Boulevard, Fairfax Avenue and Third Street. The stadium was built by Earl Gilmore, son of Arthur F. Gilmore and president of A. F.

Drivers that were killed at the track include Ed Haddad, Swede Lindskog, Speedy Lockwood, Frankie Lyons, and Chet Mortemore. In the sixteen years of the stadium's existence, over 5 million fans attended races at the track. The stadium drew crowds over 18,000 people each race. Attendance dropped to below 9,000 at normal weekly races by the late 1940s. The attendance drop and increased demand for property in West Hollywood led to the track's sale in 1950.

The Théâtre du peuple is constructed entirely of wood and can seat up to 1,200 people. The Théâtre du peuple was the first people's theatre to be established in France after the Revolution. Originally it was an open-air theatre, in which Pottecher staged folk and morality plays, often performed by locals in dialect. Its low costs, low ticket prices and the offer of a free performance per season proved a successful formula for Sunday-afternoon theatre. Pottecher used his success as a platform to launch a people's theatre campaign (soon taken up by Nobel-prize winner Romain Rolland).

The Kay K-161 ThinTwin electric guitar made from 1952 to 1959, was one of the longest produced guitars by Kay Musical Instrument Company. The K161 Thin-Twin was commonly referred to as the \\"Jimmy Reed\\" guitar. Introduced not long after Gibson's Les Paul, the ThinTwin was a semi-hollow body guitar and larger than its name \\"thin\\" implied. The guitar's body was deep. \\"ThinTwin\\" was a reference to the unique appearance of the dual pickups, having a very slim profile. There was also a Silvertone-branded version of this guitar, with a slightly more 'regal' appointment in ts decorated pickguard and headstock logo, coupled with a deeply finished 'flamed' grain top and so-called 'sunburst' finish. Both the pickguard and the headstock's decorated laminate on early versions of this model sported a shield-type engraving and coloring, with later versions of the guitar losing the shield from the headstock of later models, but with the sky-blue-trimmed pickguard never losing the shield, which sat right in the middle of the strumming field. The earliest model of this guitar, the model #1381 had the shield device on both the pickguard and the headstock laminate. Later versions of that model would only have the gold filled free-form script \\"Silvertone' logo within an headstock edge-tracing blue border, much like the appearance in width and color of the blue line trimming the pickguard. The very last-produced of the 1381 guitars and into the versions sold as the model #1369, were topped with a thin metal script Silvertone set in a glossy black field. Model 1381/1369 \\"Thin Twin\\" Manufactured by Kay was available from the Spring/Summer Sears catalog of 1954 through the Fall/Winter version going into early 1958. In the Spring/Summer catalog of 1957, the model number changed to 1369, and that number lasted until the retirement of the model in early 1958, being available in the Fall/Winter 1957 catalog. Description of shield: A front view drawing of a crown ringed around the edge we can see with three fleur-de-lis-like tips. Across the face of the ring between the tips and the edge of the crown that would sit on the head when worn, are three round circles representing jewels. From left to right, the circles are colored red, blue, red. Under this drawing of a crown is a long shield just slightly narrower than the crown device. This shield is bisected from approximately 1/3 the way down on its right side, on a 45 degree angle line that has a width appropriate with extending the width of that line so as to reach the bottom third of the device on its left side. The fields this wide band separates are brown with a gold musical note within its borders on the top and bottom fields. Vintage Catalog listings and Examples of this guitar at SilvertoneWorld Started in 1890 and based in Chicago, Illinois, the Kay Musical Instrument Company introduced, in 1957, the Gold \\"K\\" line of guitars. These included electric guitars as well as archtop and flattop acoustics. Before then, the company's guitars had been known mostly for student and department store grade instruments. They made instruments for many companies under different names; \\"Old Kraftsman\\", \\"Airline\\" and \\"Silvertone\\" were just a few of them used. They stopped making the \\"K\\" Gold line in 1962. Kay had got Barney Kessel, the top guitarist in the late 1950s, to endorse three models (Jazz Special, Artist, and Pro) of the series.

He coached at Rhode Island State College (now the University of Rhode Island) from 1920 to 1948 and taught a style of basketball using a fast-breaking offense and a full-court defense. In his 28 years at Rhode Island, Keaney's basketball Rams won eight conference championships and had only one losing season. In 1939, Keaney's Rams became the first college team to score more than 50 points per game, and in 1943 the team had an average of more than two points per minute (80.7 points per game), which led to the Rams being dubbed \\"The Firehouse Gang\\". During his tenure the URI team had four National Invitation Tournament appearances. Keaney's career record with the men's basketball team was 401–124 (.764). After retiring from coaching collegiate basketball, Keaney was offered the position of head coach of the Boston Celtics. Keaney's doctor, however, refused to let him take the job. He remained at URI as athletic director until 1959. The university named the Frank W. Keaney Gymnasium-Armory in his honor in 1953. Keaney was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1960.

The shrub is native to central and southern Europe, northwest Africa and western Asia;Altervista Flora Italiana, Crespino comune, Sowberry, Common Barberry, vinettier, espino cambrón, Sauerdorn, Berberis vulgaris L. includes photos, drawings, and European distribution map it is also naturalised in northern Europe, including the British Isles and Scandinavia, and North America. In the United States and Canada, it has become established in the wild over an area from Nova Scotia to Nebraska, with additional populations in Colorado, Idaho, Washington state, Montana, and British Columbia.Flora of North America vol 3 Although not naturalised, in rural New Zealand it has been widely cultivated as a hedge on farms. It is cultivated for its fruits in many countries. Description It is a deciduous shrub growing up to high. The leaves are small oval, long and broad, with a serrated margin; they are borne in clusters of 2–5 together, subtended by a three-branched spine 3–8 mm long. The flowers are yellow, across, produced on long panicles in late spring. The fruit is an oblong red berry long and broad, ripening in late summer or autumn; they are edible but sour. Culinary uses Dried barberries The berries are edible and rich in vitamin C, though with a very sharp flavor; the thorny shrubs make harvesting them difficult, so in most places, they are not widely consumed. They are an important food for many small birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. In Europe, the berries have been traditionally used as an ingredient in making jam. The berries are high in pectin which makes the jam congeal as it cools after having been boiled. In southwestern Asia, especially Iran, the berries are used for cooking, as well as for jam-making. In Iran, barberries are commonly used as a currant in rice pilaf. zerešk is the Persian name for the dried fruit of Berberis spp., particularly also that of Berberis integerrima called zerešk bi-dâne, literally “seedless barberry”, which is widely cultivated in Iran. Iran is the largest producer of zerešk. The South Khorasan province in Iran is the main area of zerešk and saffron production in the world, especially around Birjand and Qaen. About 85% of production is in Qaen and about 15% in Birjand. There is evidence of cultivation of seedless barberry in South Khorasan two hundred years ago. A garden of zerešk is called zerešk-estân. Zerešk is widely used in cooking, imparting a tart flavor to chicken dishes. It is usually cooked with rice, called zerešk polo, and provides a nice meal with chicken. Other uses The plant has been widely cultivated for hedges in New Zealand. Berberis vulgaris (European barberry) is the alternate host species of the wheat rust fungus (Puccinia graminis), a grass-infecting rust fungus that is a serious fungal disease of wheat and related grains. For this reason, cultivation of B. vulgaris is prohibited in Canada and some areas of the United States (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire). Salishan people have used \\"barberry\\" to treat acne in their traditional medicine, although bark of the native M. aquifolium (formerly B. aquifolium, Oregon grape) and other Mahonia species was used. Native American Indians used the roots or berries as a general herbal tonic to stimulate appetite. A decoction of the plant has been used as a folk medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments and coughs, although its use has been limited due to the bitter taste of the bark and root.

He was the fourth Archbishop of Hartford, having previously served as Bishop of Buffalo from 1995 to 2003. The Archbishop is believed by many in the Buffalo Diocese to have an eidetic memory. He can remember names of, for example, Confirmation candidates without note cards or assistance. Pope Francis accepted Archbishop Mansell's resignation from the pastoral care of the archdiocese on October 29, 2013, the Archbishop having reached the mandatory retirement age a year earlier. Pope Francis appointed Bishop Leonard Paul Blair of Toledo, Ohio as the new Archbishop on the same day. Early life Henry Mansell was born in The Bronx to Henry and Bridget (née Finn) Mansell, and baptized at St. Augustine's Church (Bronx) three weeks later. He has a sister, Ann. Mansell attended Cathedral College, the preparatory seminary of the Archdiocese of New York, in Manhattan from 1951-57, and then entered St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in 1959. He studied at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Martin O'Connor on December 19, 1962. He earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Gregorian in 1963, and did postgraduate work at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. until 1965. Ministry Mansell served as a parish priest at parishes in Harrison, his native Bronx, and SS John and Paul parish in Larchmont. He was appointed director of the Office of Parish Councils on June 9, 1972, and Vice Chancellor of the Archdiocese of New York on July 1, 1985. On March 17, 1986, Mansell was made an Honorary Prelate of His Holiness. He later became director of Priest Personnel and Chancellor (1988) of the Archdiocese.

While Mansell did not oversee any church closures during his leadership in Buffalo, he lauded praises and support for the Diocese when it was actually in decline. Bishop Edward Kmiec then took on the role as Bishop of Buffalo after Mansell, faced with more than $3 million in debt, a declining Catholic population, and decreased viability for keeping many schools and churches open. Archbishop of Hartford, Connecticut Pope John Paul II promoted Mansell to the fourth Archbishop of Hartford, Connecticut, on October 20, 2003. He was installed on December 18 of that same year.

When he was three years old, the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland where, in 1811, he was enrolled in St. Mary's College. After graduation he worked in the family dry goods business.

It has a removable door made of clay or alternatively a cast-iron door, and was a standard fitting for most kitchen fireplaces in Cornwall and Devon. The oven would be built into the side of the chimney breast, often appearing as a round bulge in the chimney. This bulge consisted of the masonry surrounding the oven, and was intended to be dismantled should the oven ever need to be replaced. During installation, they are surrounded by packed clay to prevent the actual oven cracking. To use a clome oven, one must enter the fireplace and build a fire within the oven. Dried gorse or blackthorn was traditionally used. As the oven has no internal chimney, the smoke is allowed to escape through the oven door, and into the adjacent fireplace where it leaves through the main chimney. Once the oven is white hot, the hot ashes are either raked out or pushed aside, then the baking is put in, and the door propped up to the opening. As cast-iron range cookers were brought into common use, it became standard practice to build a dividing wall to split the fireplace into two separate fireplaces, thus allowing access to the clome oven, as well as providing a space of the correct dimensions to fit a Cornish range or similar. Bricks were the most common building material for this task, since the installation of a Cornish range required a brick flue to be built up the back of the fireplace. Many clome ovens were preserved in situ in this way.

A battling left-handed opening batsman, Hewett could post a large score in a short time against even the best bowlers. Capable of hitting the ball powerfully, he combined an excellent eye with an unorthodox style to be regarded at his peak as one of England's finest batsmen. Hewett was educated at Harrow School, won a Blue at Oxford in 1886 and played for Somerset from 1884. As an inconsistent middle-order batsman he made little impact during this period. Even so, he was appointed captain of Somerset in 1889. Over the next two years, his leadership and performances as an opening batsman were instrumental in the county regaining first-class status and admission to the County Championship in 1891. He remained Somerset captain for a further three seasons, usually opening the batting with Lionel Palairet. In 1892, they shared a partnership of 346 for the first wicket, of which Hewett scored 201. The stand remains the county's highest first-wicket partnership.As of February 2011. In that season, Hewett made 1,405 runs at an average of more than 35, and was named as one of the \\"Five Batsmen of the Year\\" by Wisden. England did not play any Test matches at home in 1892, or else Hewett would probably have won a Test cap; instead his highest accolade was being selected to play for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's in 1894. A disagreement over whether play should take place on a sodden pitch in the match against the Australians in 1893 led to Hewett's departure from Somerset at the end of that season. He played first-class cricket for three more years, during which time he scored centuries against both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, appearing for a variety of amateur and representative sides. Having been selected to captain an \\"England XI\\" at Scarborough in 1895, Hewett was involved in another incident caused by a wet pitch. Feeling insulted by shouts of derision from the crowd, he left the match at lunch-time on the first day. He made only one further first-class appearance: playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University in 1896. Hewett practised as a barrister, having been called to the Bar at the Inner Temple. Early life Herbert Tremenheere Hewett was born at Norton Court in Norton Fitzwarren, near Taunton on 25 May 1864, the only son of William Henry and Frances M Hewett. Although he was the couple's only son, they had at least four daughters; in 1871 two older sisters, Emily Louisa and HelenG are listed in the census, along with one younger sister, Florance Ethel. Original data: By 1891, Mary W is also listed as a younger sister, although by this date both older sisters are no longer registered at the address nor their father William Henry. Original data: He was initially educated at Hillside, Godalming where he was captain of the cricket and rugby teams. On leaving Hillside in 1879 he went to Harrow School. In 1881 he had a trial for the school cricket eleven mainly on the strength of his bowling, having taken all ten wickets for 22 runs in a house match. Hewett was part of the school's cricket first eleven in 1882 and 1883, and appeared in the annual contest against Eton College in both years, but did little on either occasion, his highest score being six, made in the first-innings in 1882. In all matches for Harrow he had a batting average of just 7.4 in 1883 and 9.5 in 1884 while his bowling average in 1884 was 32.10. Hewett also appeared in the school association football eleven in 1883. On completion of his studies at Harrow, he attended Trinity College, Oxford. In his reminiscences, W. G. Grace suggests that Hewett \\"first won some little renown in Public School and 'Varsity cricket, but it was not until he joined Somersetshire that he forced himself to a prominent place in County Cricket.\\" Oxford and Somerset (1884–1888) After appearing in The Freshman's Match in 1884, during which he scored zero and eight and took two wickets, Hewett made little impact in his first season at Oxford and was not selected for the University eleven. His debut in first-class cricket came later that season for Somerset County Cricket Club at Tunbridge Wells, when he was 20 years old. Against Kent in late August, he scored 14 and0 batting as part of the middle order, and claimed his only two wickets in first-class cricket. He made one other appearance in 1884, against Lancashire. In 1885 Hewett played in a trial match at Oxford without success. He did, however, play in four of Somerset's six first-class matches that summer. In his first game of the season for Somerset, in mid-July, Hewett scored his maiden half-century; he remained 50 not out in the second-innings of a five-wicket victory over Hampshire. He passed 50 for Somerset on two more occasions during 1885, and finished the season with 247 runs at a batting average of 35.28, one of seven seasons in which his average was in excess of 30. Hewett (back row, second from the left) with the Oxford University cricket team in 1886 He started the 1886 season well, scoring 151 for his college and 164 not out for Perambulators against Etceteras. An 1893 write-up in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said: \\"early in the season of 1886 [Hewett] showed signs of the brilliant hitting which has since made him famous\\". Although he top-scored in the Seniors Match, he was not selected for the eleven until the university's third game. He made scores of 49 and 77 in successive matches for Oxford University against Lancashire and gained his Blue, scoring 0and7 in the University Match against Cambridge. He finished the season fourth in the Oxford University batting averages with his 160 runs being scored at 22.85, and was described in James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual as being: \\"Sometimes a most dashing left-handed hitter, but not at all dependable; hard-working field.\\" Poor results in 1885 saw Somerset lose their first-class status for the following seasons.Foot (1986), pp. 23–28. Somerset played just six matches in 1886 of which Hewett played two, top-scoring with 69 against Devon. An injury to his hand prevented him from playing all but one match for the university in his final year at Oxford, 1887, when \\"he would have had a good chance of retaining his place in the University eleven\\", according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, although he was fit enough to score a century with a broomstick in a college match. During 1887, in a second-class match for Somerset against Warwickshire, Hewett scored 98 to help Somerset to an innings victory, scoring the first 92 runs in less than an hour, an unusually high rate of scoring. The next year, 1888, he scored successive half-centuries for Somerset early in the season against Warwickshire and Staffordshire before making his debut for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Facing Oxford University, Hewett made zero and eight for the London club. The same summer, Hewett was selected to play for an England XI against the touring Australians, and in a ten wicket win for the tourists, he scored 12 and 1. Between 1884 and 1888 Hewett had limited success at the first-class level, establishing a reputation as a useful, if erratic, hard- hitting middle-order batsman. He played a lot of club cricket, being a regular for Harrow Wanderers, and scoring 201 not out for Senior Common Room against Christ Church in 1888. Captaining Somerset Second-class county Hewett's appearances for Somerset in 1889 were more successful. Having previously appeared in the middle-order, Hewett switched to opening the innings at the start of the season, and took on the captaincy. He scored three half-centuries in the season: two against Warwickshire, and one against Staffordshire. He comfortably headed the Somerset batting with an average of 38 in matches against the other second-class counties. In his history of Somerset cricket, Sunshine, Sixes and Cider, David Foot describes Hewett's selection policy as captain as being one that was more dependent on the cricketing ability of the player than \\"of [the player's] social charm and ability to drink into the early hours\\"—unlike some of his predecessors.Foot (1986), p. 34. In 1890, his side were unbeaten against county opposition, winning the \\"Second-class County Championship\\".Foot (1986), p. 27. In an early season first-class appearance for A. J. Webbe's XI, Hewett scored his maiden first-class century, reaching 114 against Cambridge University. Later in May, for the MCC against Oxford University, he scored 71. Hewett top-scored with 65 in the second-innings of Somerset's opening county match of 1890, and two matches later scored 64 during a first-wicket partnership of 115 with Lionel Palairet against Leicestershire. A string of lower scores followed for just under a month before Somerset hosted Staffordshire at Taunton. Having dismissed the visitors for 43, Hewett remained 203 not out when he declared the Somerset innings closed, scored in four hours, \\"a remarkable display of powerful and well-timed hitting\\". He did not pass 100 again that season, but came close during the Scarborough Festival, being bowled for 99 in the second- innings for the Gentlemen of England. Hewett led Somerset's batting averages in 1890, during which the club won twelve and tied one of their thirteen matches against county opposition. Due to this record the county were admitted to the County Championship for 1891 after a unanimous vote, regaining their first-class status.Foot (1986), pp. 27–28. While Red Lillywhite assessed him as \\"a dangerous left-hand bat, very free, but somewhat uncertain; good point\\", after the 1889 season, a year later he was described as \\"one of the very best left-hand bats in England, hitting hard all round; excellent point. Captain in 1889–1890, which post he filled with wonderful judgement.\\" At the end of the 1890 season he was presented with a handsome silver flask by members of Somerset County Cricket Club. County Championship cricket Hewett (seated, third from the left) with the Somerset team of 1892 Hewett led his side in their first County Championship match starting on 18 May 1891. Although the club had played first-class cricket a few years earlier, the championship had only been formed the previous season. Their debut in the competition was interrupted by rain and finished a draw; Hewett top-scored in Somerset's only innings with 31. Somerset's next match was against reigning county champions Surrey. Lionel Palairet, Bill Roe and Sammy Woods were all missing for various reasons, leaving Hewett with a depleted side and only two real bowlers; Ted Tyler and George Nichols. Surrey reached 449, and then bowled Somerset out twice, for 37 in each innings.Foot (1986), pp. 28–29. When Surrey travelled to Taunton later that season, most likely expecting an easy win to secure a second consecutive championship, Hewett top-scored for his team with 55 in the first-innings as Somerset reached 194. Woods, Nichols and Tyler then secured a 40 run first-innings lead for the home side who added another 331 runs in their second-innings, Hewett contributing 42. The same trio of Somerset bowlers proceeded to bowl the champions out for a second time, the final wicket falling two minutes from the close of play, and their team recorded a 130-run victory.Foot (1986), pp. 29–32. Hewett had a quiet season with the bat, in addition to his 55 against Surrey he passed 50 on only one other occasion; against Middlesex two weeks later. He totalled 514 runs during the season at an average of 19.76; his lowest average when playing eight or more innings in a season. Touring North America Following the close of the 1891 County Championship, Hewett was part of Lord Hawke's party which toured North America, playing six matches in the United States of America and two in Canada. Sammy Woods wrote that Hewett, along with Charles Wreford-Brown and George Ricketts, became very seasick on the journey there.Woods (1925), p. 45. The first two matches were first-class fixtures against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. Hewett scored 30 and 49 in the first, an eight wicket loss which Woods blamed on taking place too soon after their arrival, claiming the team \\"had hardly found our land-legs.\\" The first match had yielded an aggregate of 861 runs, the second contained only 352, of which Hewett scored 10 and 29. His captain, Lord Hawke, was the only other batsman to reach double figures in both innings as the touring side won by four wickets. None of the remaining fixtures on the tour had first-class status, and not all were eleven-a-side contests. Hewett scored 113 against the sixteen man All New York on Staten Island, a match in which he was standing in as captain due to Lord Hawke being ill.Woods (1925), p. 46. Woods rated Hewett, along with Lord Hawke and Brown, as the best batsmen on the tour.Woods (1925), p. 47. Batsman of the Year Hewett (right) with Lionel Palairet after their record first-wicket partnership of 346 against Yorkshire in 1892Hewett's first three matches of the 1892 season were for representative sides against the universities. He reached double figures in each of his six innings, and scored a half-century for the Gentlemen of England against Cambridge. On returning to Somerset, he did not score a half-century until his third match, making 54 against Oxford University. He passed 50 on twelve occasions during the season, the most during any season of his career. In late August, playing Yorkshire, Hewett scored 201 out of a partnership of 346, establishing a record for the first wicket in first-class cricket, surpassing W.G. Grace and Bransby Cooper's 1869 total of 283.Roebuck (1991), p. 62. Although their record has since been beaten in first-class cricket, it remains Somerset's record partnership for the first wicket. Their partnership was described as \\"Pure grace at one end, sheer force at the other\\", in H.S. Altham and E. W. Swanton's A History of Cricket. At the time, The Daily Telegraph reported that the pair remained together for three and half hours, during which Hewett scored 30 fours. Hewett finished the season with 1,047 runs for Somerset, making him the only batsman in England to score 1,000 runs in county matches. In total he scored 1,407 first-class runs, the most by any batsman, and was third in the amateur batting averages. He was named as one of the Five Batsmen of the Year by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1893, in which it was claimed that \\"had it been necessary last August [1892] to put a representative England eleven into the field, Hewett would undoubtedly have been given a place.\\" Under Hewett's captaincy, Somerset won eight, drew three and lost five matches in 1892, finishing third in the County Championship, which would remain their highest position for over 100 years, until the county were runners-up in the competition in 2001. The Times praised the county's achievements during the year, and reserved special praise for Hewett; \\"Somerset's many brilliant feats, and the fine play of Messrs. Hewett and Palairet in particular, were a marked feature of this year's cricket.\\" After the close of the County Championship, Hewett appeared in three representative matches, captaining the West to victory over the East, and appearing under the captaincy of W.G. Grace for both the South and the Gentlemen vPlayers. Departure from Somerset Hewett began the 1893 season in good form, reaching his half-century in each of his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May. Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time George Wood replaced him as a substitute. In July 1893, the touring Australians played Somerset at Taunton for the first time since 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the umpires inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself.Roebuck (1991), pp. 66–67. The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the Quantock Hills.Foot (1986), pp. 42–45. Hewett, along with Woods and Vernon Hill, arranged to play golf in Minehead.Woods (1925), pp. 51–52. The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take another look at the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that \\"the decision not to play was premature.\\" At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that \\"Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once.\\" David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's \\"mind wasn't on the game.\\" No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets. Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that \\"if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him.\\" Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season. Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects. In his five further games for Somerset before the end of the season Hewett hit two centuries. He reached 120 runs against Nottinghamshire and against Gloucestershire, on his final appearance for the county, he scored 112 runs in just under two hours; according to James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual, it \\"was a splendid display\\". He scored 1,092 runs in total during 1893, of which his 669 for Somerset in the championship were scored at an average of 31.85, topping the county's batting charts. During his five seasons of first-class cricket for Somerset, he played 51 matches and scored 2,592 runs at an average of 30.85. Later cricket career and life After leaving Somerset, Hewett did not continue in county cricket at all, opting to play first-class cricket only for amateur and representative sides. At the tail-end of the 1893 season, he played three times for the South, scoring two half-centuries. In July 1894, Hewett made the second of his two appearances for the Gentlemen against the Players. Unlike his first appearance, made at Hastings, the match was played at Lord's Cricket Ground, which was generally considered to be the more prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture of the season, being the more representative. These matches were keenly contested during the 1890s, and were considered to be second in prestige only to gaining a Test cap. Batting at number three, Hewett scored 12 runs out of the Gentlemen's total of 254, before Stanley Jackson and Hewett's former Somerset colleague, Sammy Woods, bowled the Players out for 108 and 107. He appeared 11 times in 1894, scoring 579 runs at an average of 34.05, higher than the previous season. Woods described Hewett as being \\"in splendid form\\" when he played, and lamented that he was no longer playing for Somerset.Woods (1925), p. 58. He scored his only century of the season for A. J. Webbe's XI, reaching 110 after opening the innings against Oxford University. He continued his form with the bat into 1895, twice scoring centuries for the Gentlemen against the universities, making 109 against Cambridge, and 102 against Oxford. During this season Hewett appeared in his first match for the amateur side I Zingari, who had strong links with both Harrow School and Somerset president Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane. Hewett played all three matches of the 1895 Scarborough Festival; he opened the innings for the MCC against Yorkshire, and then captained the South in their loss against the North. In the third match, Hewett was named captain of an England XI, a compliment for the former Somerset captain. However, rain meant the start was delayed. Unlike a couple of years earlier, Hewett was happy to ignore the puddles in the field and start the match at the scheduled time. The umpires disagreed with him, and the crowd, wanting cricket, blamed Hewett for the delay and lack of sport. When he belatedly led his side onto the field, the spectators threw insults at him until the Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, shouted \\"Keep quiet or I'll think about calling the game off\\".Foot (1986), p. 45. Hewett did not bother with such threats, and left the field, got changed and departed from the ground, taking no further part in the game. Fred Spofforth replaced him in the match which the England side went on to win by nine wickets. During the English winter of 1895–96, Hewett once again toured with Lord Hawke, travelling to South Africa. Arriving too late to take part in the first match of the tour, he then played the next four matches, but was summoned back to England by important business. The tour included three matches against a South African national team which were deemed to be Tests, but by this stage of the tour Hewett had left South Africa, and he thus completed his cricket career without any Test appearances. He played his final first-class match in 1896, scoring 86 for the MCC against Oxford University. In this match, for unknown reasons, he appeared as \\"Mr. H Herbert\\". > \\"When Mr 'Herbert' came in to bat... many of the spectators in the free > seats did not recognise him, but after he had sampled an over or two, an old > gentleman, who had shown some knowledge of the game, hit the nail on the > head when he remarked: I don't remember to have seen this Mr 'Erbert' before > but he's 'class'.\\" He continued to play cricket for the Harrow Wanderers, MCC and I Zingari until 1901. At the time of the 1901 Census, Hewett was living in Westminster. He was listed as head of the household, the only other resident being a servant. Original data: Hewett practised as a barrister, having trained at the Inner Temple, where he passed at least one exam in 1890. During the First World War, he served in the Territorial Force Reserve as an Assistant Provost Marshal, an appointment which he held from 7September 1915 until 24 May 1918. He died in Hove, Sussex on 4March 1921, and his funeral was held in Norton Fitzwarren four days later. His obituary in The Times describes only Hewett's cricket career, and does not give any details about his later life. It does not mention a spouse or any children. The notice of his funeral in the same paper says: \\"The whole village [of Norton Fitzwarren] was in mourning and among those present at the graveside were Mr H. E. Murray Anderdon, president, and Mr S. M. J. Woods, secretary of the Somerset Cricket Club.\\" Personality and style Hewett demonstrating an on drive, photographed by George Beldham in 1905. When Hewett was named as one of the Five Batsmen of the Year by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1893, the publication described him as \\"the finest left-handed batsman in England\\". He played in an unorthodox but attractive fashion, which prompted W.G. Grace to praise \\"his dashing and fearless hitting\\", while remarking that he had an awkward style. In Somerset, Cider and Sixes, David Foot described that he was \\"possessed of an eagle eye, considerable meat and the ability to make his forcing shots attractive.\\"Foot (1986), p. 39. In Peter Roebuck's From Sammy to Jimmy, he offered a similar portrait of Hewett's batting style, adding that \\"he saw it as his task to conquer\\".Roebuck (1991), p. 49. Hewett's batting received praise in H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton's A History of Cricket, where he is described as a \\"singularly determined and venomous\\" batsman who \\"hit the ball in unexpected and demoralizing directions.\\" He frequently scored his runs rapidly, as described by the Reverend R.S. Holmes, who wrote of his batting against Nottinghamshire; \\"the Captain scored at his usual rate – three out of four runs notched, represent his pace. Against Surrey he got 61 out of 81, this time 60 out of the same total. That's the kind of example every captain should set – a run a minute, or thereabouts.\\" In summary of the 1892 season The Cricket Annual notes that \\"the Somerset player, in fact, had established the reputation of being the most punishing batsman and rapid scorer of the day, and on last season's form no representative eleven could be considered complete without him.\\" Sammy Woods claimed that Hewett disliked fielding, but offered the view that he was good at point. Woods also related how Hewett would chew on a toothpick, which he always had in his mouth when fielding, when his team was losing.Woods (1925), p. 52. As evidenced by the manner in which Hewett left Somerset and walked off during the Scarborough Festival of 1895, he possessed a short fuse. Teammate Frederic John Poynton characterised his captain as a player who suffered \\"from a deep, difficult nature, which once upset, took long to recover\\". He was a strong leader who was both respected and feared by his colleagues. In 1885, Somerset County Cricket Club had failed to field eleven players for some of their first-class contests, and in most of their other matches were a poor side. Hewett took on the county captaincy in 1889, and in his second year led his side unbeaten against fellow county opposition to win the 'Second-class County Championship', and gain re- admission to the first-class game. Hewett's batting and captaincy were aided by the emergence of Woods and Palairet, both of whom were named as Wisden Cricketers of the Year between 1889 and 1893. In 1891, Somerset finished joint fifth among the nine first-class counties, while the subsequent year they rose to third. Hewett's final season at Somerset was the county's least successful under his captaincy, winning just four of their sixteen matches to finish in eighth.

Whilst the school mainly admits boys, a small number girls have been educated at the school within the Sixth Form. The School holds specialist status in Sports.  History  The old Borden Grammar School now Sittingbourne Adult Education College Plans for a boys' school in Borden began in 1875, as a new way of using some of the accumulated funds from the Barrow Trust, established from the estate of William Barrow (d. 1707), a local farmer, for the benefit of the poorer inhabitants of the village. The trustees of the Barrow Trust became the new school's governors, and they began organising a suitable sum of money to allow the project to go ahead. Within a few years, they had amassed £9,500 and the building of the school began on a seven acre site in Riddles Road, which belonged to the trust. The Barrow Boy's School, Borden, was to be an independent day and boarding school, designed to have some fifty boarders and some 150 day pupils. The School formally opened in October 1878, with just twenty-three pupils (nine of them from the village of Borden) and one full-time member of staff (the headmaster, Rev. William Henry Bond). A full-time assistant master was recruited in 1880, followed by a second full-time assistant master in 1883.K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998) In 1893, Rev. Bond left to become headmaster of Churcher's College, and was replaced by James Williamson Thurnham, who was keen to increase the number of boarders at the School, which by now was known as Barrow School, Borden. Boarders came from all parts of the country and, indeed, the world, with some hailing from France, Spain, India and Jamaica. Thurnham left to establish New College, Herne Bay in 1906, and took most of the 120 boarders and the majority of the School's staff with him, leaving the next headmaster, William Murdock, with the difficult task of building up numbers once more. Soon after Murdock's appointment, the School began to be referred to as Borden Barrow's Boys' School and was taken into the state education system in 1906. The School now became known as Borden School, a name that had appeared as part of the School badge since at least 1885, but, by 1910, there were six annual scholarships to 'Borden Grammar School', the name by which the School has been known ever since. Up until the 1914, there had still been a few boarders at the School but, after the First World War, it became a day grammar school.K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), pp. 3-4 In the early summer of 1929, the School moved to its present site on the Avenue of Remembrance, Sittingbourne, not only because of the rising maintenance costs of the original premises and the fact that it was no longer possible to attract suitable numbers of boys with the school being so far from the centre of Sittingbourne. The new building was formally opened by George, Lord Harris in October 1929, but the School retained its original name despite no longer being located in Borden. The old school building was used for a time as an agricultural college, and is now an Adult Education Centre. In January 1931, work began on the construction of a cricket pavilion as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who were killed in the First World War, most of the money being provided by the Old Bordenian Association. The original pavilion was replaced by a modern structure in 2004, which continues to serve as a memorial to all those old boys who were killed in the First World War.K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p.5 In May 1940, the Government announced that a number of towns on the Southeast Coast were to have their children evacuated: Sheerness was one such town, and some sixty-five pupils from Borden, accompanied by three masters, were evacuated to Pengam, South Wales, where the boys were to attend the Lewis School. Meanwhile, air raid shelters were built on the east side of the school site in Sittingbourne and, later, to the north of the cricket pavilion. In May 1949, a clock tower was unveiled by the Bishop of Dover as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who lost their lives in the Second World War, the funds once again being provided by the Old Bordenian Association.K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 6 The word 'Grammar' was removed from the School's name in 1972, in accordance with a change in the local education system, and there were fears that Borden might be turned into a Sixth Form college. These fears were, however, not realised, and Borden remained a selective school, admitting pupils at thirteen rather than after the 11+ Examination. In 1982, the word 'Grammar' was restored to the School's name, and entry at eleven resumed in 1994.K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 7 In 1979, a new teaching block, the Hardy Block (named for the School's fifth headmaster, George Hardy), was opened by Commander John Bostock, DSC, RN, chairman of governors. The first phase of another new teaching block, the Short Block (named for the School's sixth headmaster, Bryan Short), was opened in 1995 and completed in 1998; the finished building was formally opened by Robin, Lord Kingsdown, the great-grandson of the School's first chairman of governors, Sir Edward Leigh Pemberton.K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998) One of the science laboratories, the Hooker Advanced Physics Laboratory, was named for and opened by Sir Stanley Hooker, an Old Bordenian and aeronautical engineer.  Modern School  On 1 September 2006 the School was awarded Specialist status for Sports and Modern Foreign Languages. With this status and an associated increase in funding, the school has built many new facilities including a multi use games area (MUGA) and the William Barrow Library. In 2011 the school also received a sports bursary, with which it used to construct a climbing wall in the gym. In 2011, three updated war memorials were installed in the School vestibule, commemorating all those Old Bordenians known to have given their lives in the conflicts of the Twentieth Century (forty casualties in the First World War, sixty casualties in the Second World War, and single casualties in the Boer War, Korean War and Northern Ireland). Borden became an academy in 2012, which changed the flexibility of the curriculum able to be taught at the school as well as increased funding. The School, along with other Sittingbourne-based Secondary schools, Fulston Manor School and Highsted Grammar School for Girls, maintain a close community and share teaching responsibilities of specialised subjects at A-Level, with Borden teaching Economics, Sociology and Psychology.  Old Bordenian Association  The Old Bordenian Association (OBA) was established in 1912, re-established in 1925, and membership is open to all former pupils and staff of Borden Grammar School. The OBA's annual journal, The Maroon, was first published in 1937, but was replaced by a website in 2009. The OBA holds an annual reunion dinner, formerly held inside the Old Hall but now in the nearby premises of UK Paper Leisure Club. The OBA also organises a Remembrance Service on the Saturday closest to Remembrance Sunday, honouring all those old boys who have lost their lives in the armed conflicts of the Twentieth Century. Apart from these annual events, the OBA's activities include the Old Bordenian Hockey Club and Old Bordenian Football Club. The OBA also strives to support the present activities of the school, and in recent years has provided a minibus and contributed toward the costs of refurbishing the School's William Barrow Library, in addition to offering career mentoring to current pupils and recent leavers.  School badge, motto and song  The School's badge, which in heraldic terms is blazoned as 'azure, a chevron or between three crescents of the last', is believed to have been derived from the coat of arms of William Barrow; however, no proof of this connection has been uncovered, despite extensive efforts in the 1930s. Some sources fancifully state that the three crescents represent successive generations of pupils at the School, but the badge was in use as early as 1885, when the School was still in its infancy. The gold border that surrounds the shield is believed to have been added when a navy blazer became part of the school uniform, so that the blue field of the shield would stand out. The School has a Latin motto, 'nitere porro', which translates as 'strive forward'. Adopted during the headmastership of William Claydon, it was taken from a speech by Julius Caesar quoted in Horace's Epistles. 'Forty Years On' was also adopted as the school song under William Claydon. This replaced an earlier school song, which began with the words 'Borden, you merit all our praise, Our home through countless happy days.'  Houses  In common with many secondary schools in England, Borden has long had a house system. At the time of the First World War, the houses were 'Blue', 'Buff' and 'Red'. These were later replaced with 'Barrow', 'Borden' and 'School', to which 'Swale' was added in the 1930s. Aside from the references to the School's location and benefactor, the etymology of 'Swale' can be explained by reference to the local stretch of water, The Swale, which runs between Sittingbourne and the Isle of Sheppey and also lends its name to the local Borough Council. This house system was brought to an end by headmaster Stephen Wright in 2002. A house system was reinstated at the start of the school year beginning September 2007. The new house names are Lord's, Wimbledon, Wembley and Twickenham, named after the homes of cricket, tennis, football and rugby in England; ironically, the School predates the namesakes of two of its houses, Wembley and Twickenham. With the loss of Barrow House, there is no longer any reference to the school's benefactor, William Barrow.  Uniform  No formal uniform existed for the first few decades of the School's existence. Prior to the First World War, some pupils wore a cap that carried a metal badge depicting the School shield; this badge later became embroidered. In the 1920s, pupils wore a tie with horizontal stripes in navy blue and gold, the School's colours. Members of the School's Cadet Corps wore khaki military uniform. By the end of the Second World War, a uniform was in place that continues to be worn, with minor modifications, to the present day: navy blazer with the School shield on the breast pocket; grey trousers; white shirt; and tie with diagonal stripes in navy blue and gold. This tie was formerly worn by all pupils in Lower and Middle School; members of the Sixth Form wore a navy blue tie with small representations of the School shield arranged diagonally, while prefects wore a plain red tie. However, following the introduction of lounge suits for the Sixth Form in 2002, the former Sixth Form tie was adopted by Middle School and the former Lower and Middle School tie adopted by Lower School only.  Cadet Corps  The School's first cadet corps was formed in 1903, affiliated to 4th Volunteer Battalion, The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) and commanded by one of the masters. The Cadet Corps was removed from the Army List in 1906, following the transfer of the headmaster, James Thurnham, and most of the School's staff and boarders, to New College, Herne Bay. It was then revived in 1917, this time affiliated to 4th The Buffs (East Kent Regiment) and commanded by the then headmaster, William Murdock. It appears to have been finally wound up by the time the School moved to the Avenue of Remembrance in 1928.  Headmasters  * 1878–1893: Rev.

Early career Toeava was born in Samoa but moved to New Zealand in 1994 to live with his grandmother. He attended De La Salle College, Mangere East, he played alongside Taniela Moa in the school's First XV rugby team. He represented New Zealand U-19 where he was named the IRB's Under-19 2005 player of the year. He played at second-five for New Zealand Under 19. Other early career highlights include playing second five for the Championship-winning Auckland Marist Under 21 side, coached by Peter Tubberty. Career Toeava played for the All Blacks and represented New Zealand in Sevens rugby. In 2005 Toeava was a shock selection for the All Blacks Grand Slam tour at only 19 years of age. He had had no Super 14 experience, and limited Provincial experience with just eight games for Auckland, and only a solitary start at first-five against Northland. He played his first-class rugby mainly at centre, wing and fullback. He played his provincial rugby for Auckland in the Air New Zealand Cup and was drafted to the Hurricanes in the 2006 Super 14 season. He played for the Blues for the 2007 season. He was instrumental in the success of the Blues in the 2007 Super 14 season, scoring four tries and setting up many others from the outside centre position. He was later nominated for Rebel Sport Super 14 Player of the Year at the 2007 Steinlager Rugby Awards. He was one of several players to be played at centre for the All Blacks in 2010 and 2011, a position which has seen numerous changes because of Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith's injuries. Toeava played the final two games of the 2011 Tri-Nations tournament. At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Toeava played in pool matches against Tonga (at left wing), Japan (at fullback) and Canada (coming of the bench in the second half). In July 2012, Toeava signed a two-year contract with the Tokyo-based Canon Eagles. In March 2016 Toeava joined Clermont as a medical joker to cover an injury crisis and has held his place at the powerful club. His form helped guide Clermont to the French Top 14 championship and to the lead in their pool of the Champions Cup in January 2017, before an arm injury that required surgery sidelined him for the rest of the season.http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/international/88517849/arm-surgery- ends-french-title-hopes-for-all-black-isaia-toeava On 16 June 2020, Toeava signs for Top 14 rivals Toulon ahead of the 2020-21 season.

This region is one of the higher levels of the ventral stream of visual processing, associated with the representation of objects, places, faces, and colors . It may also be involved in face perception,Haxby indicates that a few studies have found face perception in the inferior temporal sulcus, with the majority of sites elsewhere in the brain: p.2, Haxby, et.al. (2000) \\"The distributed human neural system for face perception\\" Trends in Cognitive Sciences 4 (6) June 2000, 11pp. and in the recognition of numbers. The inferior temporal gyrus is the anterior region of the temporal lobe located underneath the central temporal sulcus. The primary function of the occipital temporal gyrus – otherwise referenced as IT cortex – is associated with visual stimuli processing, namely visual object recognition, and has been suggested by recent experimental results as the final location of the ventral cortical visual system. The IT cortex in humans is also known as the Inferior Temporal Gyrus since it has been located to a specific region of the human temporal lobe. The IT processes visual stimuli of objects in our field of vision, and is involved with memory and memory recall to identify that object; it is involved with the processing and perception created by visual stimuli amplified in the V1, V2, V3, and V4 regions of the occipital lobe. This region processes the color and form of the object in the visual field and is responsible for producing the “what” from this visual stimuli, or in other words identifying the object based on the color and form of the object and comparing that processed information to stored memories of objects to identify that object. The IT cortex’s neurological significance is not just its contribution to the processing of visual stimuli in object recognition but also has been found to be a vital area with regards to simple processing of the visual field, difficulties with perceptual tasks and spatial awareness, and the location of unique single cells that possibly explain the IT cortex’s relation to memory. Structure Human right cerebral hemisphere. Lateral view (left) and medial view (right). In both images, inferior temporal gyrus labeled at bottom. The areas colored green represent temporal lobe. (Brown is occipital and purple is limbic respectively.) The temporal lobe is unique to primates. In humans, the IT cortex is more complex than their relative primate counterparts. The human inferior temporal cortex consists of the inferior temporal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus. When looking at the brain laterally – that is from the side and looking at the surface of the temporal lobe – the inferior temporal gyrus is along the bottom portion of the temporal lobe, and is separated from the middle temporal gyrus located directly above by the inferior temporal sulcus. Additionally, some processing of the visual field that corresponds to the ventral stream of visual processing occurs in the lower portion of the superior temporal gyrus closest to the superior temporal sulcus. The medial and ventral view of the brain – meaning looking at the medial surface from below the brain, facing upwards – reveals that the inferior temporal gyrus is separated from the fusiform gyrus by the occipital-temporal sulcus. This human inferior temporal cortex is much more complex than that of other primates: non-human primates have an inferior temporal cortex that is not divided into unique regions such as humans' inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, or middle temporal gyrus. This region of the brain corresponds to the inferior temporal cortex and is responsible for visual object recognition and receives processed visual information. The inferior temporal cortex in primates has specific regions dedicated to processing different visual stimuli processed and organized by the different layers of the striate cortex and extra-striate cortex. The information from the V1 –V5 regions of the geniculate and tectopulvinar pathways are radiated to the IT cortex via the ventral stream: visual information specifically related to the color and form of the visual stimuli. Through comparative research between primates – humans and non-human primates – results indicate that the IT cortex plays a significant role in visual shape processing. This is supported by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected by researchers comparing this neurological process between humans and macaques. Function  Receiving Information  The light energy that comes from the rays bouncing off of an object is converted into chemical energy by the cells in the retina of the eye. This chemical energy is then converted into action potentials that are transferred through the optic nerve and across the optic chiasm, where it is first processed by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. From there the information is sent to the primary visual cortex, region V1. It then travels from the visual areas in the occipital lobe to the parietal and temporal lobes via two distinct anatomical streams. These two cortical visual systems were classified by Ungerleider and Mishkin (1982, see two-streams hypothesis). One stream travels ventrally to the inferior temporal cortex (from V1 to V2 then through V4 to ITC) while the other travels dorsally to the posterior parietal cortex. They are labeled the “what” and “where” streams, respectively. The Inferior Temporal Cortex receives information from the ventral stream, understandably so, as it is known to be a region essential in recognizing patterns, faces, and objects. The dorsal stream (green) and ventral stream (purple) originating in the primary visual cortex. Single-Cell Function in the Inferior Temporal Gyrus The understanding at the single-cell level of the IT cortex and its role of utilizing memory to identify objects and or process the visual field based on color and form visual information is a relatively recent in neuroscience. Early research indicated that the cellular connections of the temporal lobe to other memory associated areas of the brain – namely the hippocampus, the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex, among others. These cellular connections have recently been found to explain unique elements of memory, suggesting that unique single-cells can be linked to specific unique types and even specific memories. Research into the single-cell understanding of the IT cortex reveals many compelling characteristics of these cells: single-cells with similar selectivity of memory are clustered together across the cortical layers of the IT cortex; the temporal lobe neurons have recently been shown to display learning behaviors and possibly relate to long-term memory; and, cortical memory within the IT cortex is likely to be enhanced over time thanks to the influence of the afferent-neurons of the medial-temporal region. Further research of the single-cells of the IT cortex suggests that these cells not only have a direct link to the visual system pathway but also are deliberate in the visual stimuli they respond to: in certain cases, the single-cell IT cortex neurons do not initiate responses when spots or slits, namely simple visual stimuli, are present in the visual field; however, when complicated objects are put in place, this initiates a response in the single- cell neurons of the IT cortex. This provides evidence that not only are the single-cell neurons of the IT cortex related in having a unique specific response to visual stimuli but rather that each individual single-cell neuron has a specific response to a specific stimuli. The same study also reveals how the magnitude of the response of these single-cell neurons of the IT cortex do not change due to color and size but are only influenced by the shape. This led to even more interesting observations where specific IT neurons have been linked to the recognition of faces and hands. This is very interesting as to the possibility of relating to neurological disorders of prosopagnosia and explaining the complexity and interest in the human hand. Additional research form this study goes into more depth on the role of \\"face neurons\\" and \\"hand neurons\\" involved in the IT cortex. The significance of the single-cell function in the IT cortex is that it is another pathway in addition to the lateral geniculate pathway that processes most visual system: this raises questions about how does it benefit our visual information processing in addition to normal visual pathways and what other functional units are involved in additional visual information processing.  The Way it Works  The information for color and form comes from P-cells that receive their information mainly from cones, so they are sensitive to differences in form and color, as opposed to the M-cells that receive information about motion mainly from rods. The neurons in the inferior temporal cortex, also called the inferior temporal visual association cortex, process this information from the P-cells. The neurons in the ITC have several unique properties that offer an explanation as to why this area is essential in recognizing patterns. They only respond to visual stimuli and their receptive fields always include the fovea, which is one of the densest areas of the retina and is responsible for acute central vision. These receptive fields tend to be larger than those in the striate cortex and often extend across the midline to unite the two visual half fields for the first time. IT neurons are selective for shape and/or color of stimulus and are usually more responsive to complex shapes as opposed to simple ones. A small percentage of them are selective for specific parts of the face. Faces and likely other complex shapes are seemingly coded by a sequence of activity across a group of cells, and IT cells can display both short or long term memory for visual stimuli based on experience.  Object Recognition  There are a number of regions within the ITC that work together for processing and recognizing the information of “what” something is. In fact, discrete categories of objects are even associated with different regions. *The fusiform gyrus or Fusiform Face Area (FFA) deals more with facial and body recognition rather than objects. Diagram depicting different regions of the left cerebral hemisphere, Fusiform in Orange. *The Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA) helps differentiate between scenes and objects. Same as above, but parahippocampal gyrus now in orange. *The Extrastriate Body Area (EBA) tells apart body parts from other objects *And the Lateral Occipital Complex (LOC) is used to determine shapes vs. scrambled stimuli. These areas must all work together, as well as with the hippocampus, in order to create an array of understanding of the physical world. The hippocampus is key for storing the memory of what an object is/what it looks like for future use so that it can be compared and contrasted with other objects. Correctly being able to recognize an object is highly dependent on this organized network of brain areas that process, share, and store information. In a study by Denys et al., functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) was used to compare the processing of visual shape between humans and macaques. They found, amongst other things, that there was a degree of overlap between shape and motion sensitive regions of the cortex, but that the overlap was more distinct in humans. This would suggest that the human brain is better evolved for a high level of functioning in a distinct, three-dimensional, visual world. Clinical significance Prosopagnosia Prosopagnosia, also called face blindness, is a disorder that results in the inability to recognize or discriminate between faces. It can often be associated with other forms of recognition impairment, such as place, car, or emotional recognition. A study conducted by Gross et all in 1969 found that certain cells were selective for the shape of a monkey hand, and they observed that as the stimulus they provided began to further resemble a monkey hand, those cells became more active. A few years later, in 1972, Gross et al. discovered that certain IT cells were selective for faces. Although it is not conclusive, ‘face-selective’ IT cortex cells are assumed to play a large role in facial recognition in monkeys. After the extensive research into the result of damage to the IT cortex in monkeys, it is theorized that lesions in the IT gyrus in humans result in prosopagnosia. Rubens and Benson’s 1971 study of a subject in life with prosopagnosia reveals that the patient is able to name common objects on visual presentation flawlessly, however she cannot recognize faces. Upon necropsy conducted by Benson et al., it was apparent that a discrete lesion in the right fusiform gyrus, a part of the inferior temporal gyrus, was one of the main causes of the subject’s symptoms. A more in depth observation can be seen with the example of patient L.H. in the study conducted by N.L. Etcoff and colleagues in 1991. This 40-year-old man was involved in an automobile accident when he was 18, which resulted in severe brain injury. Upon recovery, L.H. was unable to recognize or discriminate between faces, or even recognize faces that were familiar to him before the accident. L.H. and other patients with prosopagnosia are often able to live relatively normal and productive lives despite their deficit. L.H. was still able to recognize common objects, subtle differences in shapes, and even age, sex, and “likeability” of faces. However, they use non-facial cues, such as height, hair color, and voice to differentiate between people. Non-invasive brain imaging revealed that L.H.’s prosopagnosia was a result of damage to the right temporal lobe, which contains the inferior temporal gyrus. Deficits in Semantic Memory Certain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and semantic dementia, are characterized by a patient’s inability to integrate semantic memories, which results in patients being unable to form new memories, lacking awareness of time period, as well as lacking other important cognitive processes. Chan et al 2001 conducted a study that used volumetric magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the global and temporal lobe atrophy in semantic dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The subjects were selected and confirmed to be in the middle of the spectrum of their respective disorders clinically, and then further confirmation came from a series of neuropsychological tests given to the subjects. The study treated the inferior temporal cortex and the middle temporal cortex as one and the same, because of the, \\"often indistinct,\\" border between the gyri. The study concluded that in Alzheimer's disease, deficits in inferior temporal structures were not the main source of the disease. Rather, atrophy in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus was prominent in the Alzheimer’s inflicted subjects of the study. With respect to semantic dementia, the study concluded that “the middle and inferior temporal gyri [cortices] may play a key role” in semantic memory, and as a result, unfortunately, when these anterior temporal lobe structures are injured, the subject is left with semantic dementia. This information shows how, despite often being grouped in the same category, Alzheimer's disease and semantic dementia are very different diseases, and are characterized by marked differences in the subcortical structures they are associated with. Cerebral Achromatopsia An example of vision in a person with cerebral achromatopsia. Cerebral achromatopsia is a medical disorder characterized by the inability to perceive color and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity in high light levels. Congenital achromatopsia is characterized the same way, however it is genetic, while Cerebral Achromatopsia occurs as a result of damage to certain parts of the brain. One part of the brain that is particularly integral to color discrimination is the inferior temporal gyrus. A 1995 study conducted by Heywood et al. was meant to highlight the parts of the brain that are important in achromatopsia in monkeys, however, it obviously sheds light on the areas of the brain related to achromatopsia in humans. In the study, one group of monkeys (group AT) received lesions in the temporal lobe anterior to V4 and the other group (group MOT) received lesions to the occipito-temporal area that corresponds in cranial location to the lesion that produces cerebral achromatopsia in humans. The study concluded that group MOT had no impairment of their color vision while the subjects in group AT all had severe impairments to their color vision, consistent with humans diagnosed with cerebral achromatopsia. This study shows that temporal lobe areas anterior to V4, which includes the inferior temporal gyrus, play a large role in patients with Cerebral Achromatopsia.

He was reelected in 2000 and retired in 2004. Elley was born in Simcoe, Ontario and was educated at McMaster University in Hamilton, where he obtained a BA in History and an MDiv in theology. He pastored several churches in the Baptist denomination in three provinces, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. In 1967, he married Louise Plester from Chemainus, British Columbia and they raised eight children—four children of their own as well as four foster children, three of whom are First Nations. Along with his wife, they fostered more than 155 children. Elley joined the Reform Party of Canada, then led by Preston Manning, in 1988 discovering that his political, social and faith views were very much aligned with Manning whom he admired. His first political activity was in 1992, when he ran a Vote No campaign on behalf of the Reform Party in the federal riding of Calgary Centre during the Charlottetown Accord constitutional referendum which he and the Party won. He then became an area manager for the Reform candidate Jim Silye. During that time he and his family moved to Vancouver Island, where he became involved in the winning campaign of Bob Ringma in 1993. After the election, he was asked to become president of the Nanaimo—Cowichan constituency association for the Reform Party. He was nominated as the Reform candidate in Nanaimo-Cowichan in 1997 and won in that year's federal election. He was re-elected in 2000 in what the local press described as a landslide win as a member of the Canadian Alliance and ended his career as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. As MP, he served as deputy critic for Health and Vice-Chair of the Health Committee for three years. He became the senior critic for Indian Affairs and Northern Development under Stockwell Day's leadership. When Stephen Harper became the leader of the Party in 2002, Elley became senior critic for Labour and continued on the Committee for Persons with Disabilities. Elley was a social conservative whose staunch opposition to same-sex marriage became a source for controversy when he was in Parliament. In 2000, as Parliament debated extending rights to same- sex couples, Elley suggested homosexuality should never have been legalized. Elley blamed former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's decision to decriminalize homosexuality in 1969 for what he said was an assault on the traditional family. Elley said: \\"He and his cohorts passed omnibus legislation which legitimized behavior which up until then had been considered outside the realm of normal.\\" Elley stood by those remarks, later telling a Vancouver Sun reporter: \\"I presented my views on the breakdown of society as I saw it. … I had deep concerns about the erosion of traditional values and I ... still continue to stand up for traditional family values.\\" He ran in the 2008 general election but was not successful, finishing second to New Democratic Party candidate Jean Crowder by more than 4,000 votes. In 2011, he was elected president of the fledgling BC Conservative Party and held the position for a year. Since his retirement from federal politics in 2004, he has held interim pastoral positions in Port Alberni, West Vancouver, Cobble Hill, and Chemainus. He is still active politically and is the current President of the Cowichan—Malahat—Langford Conservative EDA. He resides in Chemainus, BC with his wife Louise.

The numbering plan area comprises most of Santa Clara County and Northern Santa Cruz County, and includes Gilroy, Morgan Hill, Saratoga, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, Cupertino, Campbell, and San Jose. Area code 408 was split from area code 415 in 1959, and area code 669 was assigned to the same numbering plan area in an overlay plan in 2012. History As of 1950, the central and northern regions of California had been divided into two numbering plan areas (NPAs) along a south-north boundary, with area code 415 assigned to the coastal stretch, and 916 for the mountainous region in the east.W. H. Nunn, Nation-wide Numbering Plan, AIEE 1952-09 p.884 Area code 408 was split from numbering plan area 415 in a flash-cut (without permissive dialing period) on March 1, 1959. On July 11, 1998, area code 408 was split, producing area code 831 for the counties of Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito. Despite this split, the 408 area code is still used in northern Santa Cruz County. On November 20, 2012, numbers in a new overlay area code 669 became available for assignment to new customers, requiring the use of ten-digit dialing in the entire area.  Los Gatos  Los Gatos is one of three cities in Santa Clara County that was not served by the Bell System. Gilroy and Morgan Hill were also outside the Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) service area. These communities were served by what was referred to in \\"Bell System circles\\" as \\"independent\\" telephone companies. According to historian Willys I. Peck, the Los Gatos Telephone Company was the first company to offer telephone service in town. Later, the Western California Telephone Company provided service to Los Gatos and to Novato, Morgan Hill, and Kenwood. In the 1970s, the utility was acquired by General Telephone and Electronics, which changed its name to GTE, and merged with Bell Atlantic in 2000 to become Verizon Communications. Verizon served these areas until April 1, 2016, when Frontier Communications took over the service. Los Gatos is served by three central offices. Historically, these were called the Six Office, the Four Office, and the Mountain Office. The first two of these designations come from the historic exchange names when the town converted from manual to dial service. Phone numbers in these two offices were ELgato-6 and ELgato-4 numbers, respectively (dialed as ELx-xxxx.) As the area migrated to seven- digit numbers, these changed to 356- and 354-numbers. In their earlier life, all numbers for the segment of town served by each office had the respective prefix or office code related to that office. As late as the early 1980s, before the modern system of digital transcribing was widely available, billing information for calls placed from Los Gatos was recorded on magnetic tape and sent to a centralized processing center in Southern California. As the tapes were processed, the charges found their way to subscribers' bills. The Mountain Office served the Summit Road community and areas of the Santa Cruz Mountains west of town. Although the office code or prefix for service from this switch was ELgato-3 (later 353), it was not referred to as the Three Office. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the area was served by Automatic Electric step-by-step (SXS) electromechanical switching equipment. The step office was a maintenance headache; it being in a rural area made the problem more difficult. Users noticed crosstalk, and dial pulsing was audible during at least some of their calls. Outside the plant in the mountain area was subject to a variety of tough environmental factors, including long loop lengths and the high humidity of the redwood forest. The area is now served by remote equipment on Summit Road connected to the central office on Los Gatos Boulevard. Before the late 1980s and the arrival of cellular and PCS mobile phone service, GTE offered Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) on VHF (152 MHz) and UHF (454 MHz) frequencies in Los Gatos. The service included full-duplex dial service. There were tight restrictions on call lengths because there were only a few channels available. In the late 1970s, daytime calls longer than three minutes were billed at over $1 per minute to discourage the long-winded. The VHF equipment was located near the Santa Clara Valley Water District's Rinconada Water Treatment Plant on More Avenue at NAD27 coordinates . The IMTS system included General Electric mobile radio voting equipment. (Voting is a form of diversity combining used in mobile radio systems on land.) One receiver for at least one of the voted IMTS channels was located in a pole mount-cabinet on a utility pole along Montevina Road off California State Route 17. These IMTS systems were dismantled after cellular systems became available to subscribers in the Bay Area. San Jose Manual service Before 1949, San Jose telephones were manual service. A subscriber would lift the receiver and wait for the operator to inquire, \\"Number Please?\\" Most telephone numbers started with Ballard or Columbia. Mayfair numbers served the east side. The City Manager's number was Ballard 1 while most numbers had four digits and a letter, (for example: Ballard 2345 W). One of four letters was appended to telephone numbers: J, M, R, or W. These letters may have tipped off the operator as to the proper keys to press to ring a subscriber who was on a party line. Dial service and numbering plan After the conversion to dial service in 1949, San Jose telephone numbers started with names including ALpine-, ANdrews-, BAldwin-, CLayburn-, and CYpress-. As the North American Dialing Plan evolved in the 1950s, these became today's 25x-, 26x-, 22x-, 258-, and 29x-numbers, respectively. When area codes were introduced in 1947 San Jose was assigned to area code 415 along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area and much of northern California. Area code 408 was created on January 1, 1959, and included most of Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito Counties. Until the late 1970s, there was permissive dialing between (408) and (415). At the time, the entire East Bay, peninsula, and on to Marin County was in area code (415). Phone numbers were not duplicated across (415) and (408), so subscribers could dial seven-digit San Francisco or Berkeley numbers without dialing an area code and the call would go through. Population growth, facsimile machines, and pagers caused demands for numbers to outrun the capacity of this permissive dialing plan. The additional demands for PCS and cellular phone numbers helped necessitate the (831)/(408) area code split, the (650)/(415) split, and the earlier (510)/(415) split. Part of the previous permissive dialing plan included a mass calling prefix for radio station contests, introduced in the 1960s because some contests put unacceptable loads on the Bay Area's telephone switches. Until the 1980s, radio station call-in contests throughout the Bay Area used 575-numbers. Electromechanical switching equipment of the day had been engineered to accommodate large call volumes to 575-numbers. Large numbers of calls would otherwise have overloaded switching equipment causing slow dial tone and blocked long distance circuits. A patchwork quilt of electromechanical switching equipment handled San Jose calls between 1949 and the 1980s. There were about eight Western Electric Crossbar switches, at least one Number 1 and mostly Number 5. There was a Western Electric 4A Crossbar that took up two floors of the Main telephone exchange. In the mid-1980s, the 4A crossbar was replaced with a digital switch which took up part of a single floor and quadrupled calling capacity. The 408 area code was the last area code in the United States to institute the requirement of dialing \\"1\\" before making a long-distance call. Mobile service Before the existence of cell phones, Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) was offered. As of 1983, three VHF and two UHF channels were available. Subscribers had either a VHF or UHF vehicle-mounted phone, consequently they could access only two or three channels over the entire San Jose area. On VHF, the maximum system capacity for the San Jose system was three simultaneous calls. There was a roaming feature, but no registration scheme like the ones used by modern PCS and cell phones.

The 408 area code was forecast to require a new area code by the second quarter of 2012. From May to October 2011, public feedback was solicited to residents in the area. On October 20, 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission confirmed implementing 669 as an overlay to the existing 408 area code, the first in the San Francisco Bay Area. The new area code became active in November 2012, following a six-month permissive dialing period. AT&T; telephone bills shortly before the overlay was to go into effect included the following information for 408 area code customers: * Effective April 21, 2012, you should begin the new dialing procedures [i.e., to use the area code] whenever you place a call from the 408 area code. If you forget and dial just seven digits, your call will still be completed. * Beginning October 20, 2012, you must use the new dialing procedures (...) for all calls. After this date, if you do not use the new dialing procedures, your call will not be completed and a recording will instruct you to hang up and dial again. * Beginning November 20, 2012, new telephone lines or services may be assigned numbers using the 669 area code.

History During almost two centuries, and more precisely the years 697-887, nine different ordinances were promulgated and kept in the record of the annals of Ireland. Each ordinance was issued either by a saint or monastic group. Three texts of these legislations have come to us, the earliest being Cáin Adomnáin - Lex Innocentium - proclaimed by Adomnán, abbot of Iona, at the synod of Birr in 697. Máirín Ní Dhonnchadha, The guarantor list of Cáin Adomnáin, 697; pp. 178-215, Brepols Online, . According to D.N. Dumville, it is suspected that the promulgation of this law in 697 was a centennial commemoration of Columba, who died in 597.Dumville, D.N., \\"Review\\" of O'Loughlin's Adomnan at Birr, AD 697: Essays in Commemoration of the Law of the Innocents in the Catholic Historical Review, pp. 283-284, Volume 89, Number 2, April 2003 As a successor of Columba of Iona, Adomnán had sufficient prestige to assemble a conference of 91 chieftains and clerics from Ireland, Dál Riata, and Pictland at Birr to promulgate the new law. As well as being the site of a significant monastery, associated with Saint Brendan of Birr, Birr was close to the boundary between the Uí Néill-dominated northern half of Ireland, and the southern half, where the kings of Munster ruled. It, therefore, represented a form of neutral ground where the rival kings and clerics of both sides of Ireland could meet. Various factors, including Marian devotion in seventh- and eighth-century Ireland, are supposed to have contributed to inspire Adomnán to introduce these laws, but it may also be that as Columba's biographer, he was prompted by the saint's example.Cf. Adomnán, Life, II, 24 and II, 25. It was originally known as the Law of the Innocents and focused on the beneficiary noncombatants. Upon its renewal in 727, it referenced its author.Charles- Edwards, T.M., Early Christian Ireland, p.560, Cambridge University Press, 2000 Content The indigenous Brehon Laws were committed to parchment about the 7th century, most likely by clerics. Most scholars now believe that the secular laws were not compiled independently of monasteries. Adomnan would have had access to the best legal minds of his generation. This set of laws were designed, among other things, to guarantee the safety and immunity of various types of noncombatants in warfare. It required, for example, that \\"whoever slays a woman... his right hand and his left foot shall be cut off before death, and then he shall die.\\" If a woman committed murder, arson, or theft from a church, she was to be set adrift in a boat with one paddle and a container of gruel. This left the judgment up to God and avoided violating the proscription against killing a woman. The laws also provided sanctions against many things like the killing of children, clerics, clerical students and peasants on clerical lands; rape; impugning the chastity of a noblewoman and women from having to take part in warfare. Much repeated traditional Irish laws. The law described both the secular fines which criminals must pay and the ritual curses to which lawbreakers were subject. Bystanders who did nothing to prevent the crime were as liable as the perpetrator.Grigg, Julianna. \\"Aspects of the Cain: Adomnan's Lex Innocentium\\", Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association, Vol.1, 2005 \\"Stewards of the Law\\" collected the fine and paid it to the victim or next of kin. Legacy Adomnán's initiative appears to be one of the first systematic attempts to lessen the savagery of warfare among Christians, a remarkable achievement for a churchman on the remote outer edge of Europe. In it, he gave local expression, in the context of the Gaelic legal tradition, to a wider Christian movement to restrain violence.\\"Adomnán's Law of the Innocents\\",Travels in Time It was an early example of international law in that it was to be enforced in Ériu and Albu, (Ireland and Britain) although Britain refers to only what is now northern Scotland for it was the kings of that region who were guarantors of the Law. As with later clerical efforts, such as the Peace and Truce of God movement in millennial France, the law may have been of limited effectiveness. Fergus Kelly notes that no cases relating to the Cáin Adomnáin have been preserved.Kelly, p. 79. Thus, it is unknown whether the harsh penalties which it mandates, which may have contradicted the general character of Irish law, were rigidly enforced.Kelly, pp.234-235: \\"the law texts of the Senchas Már collection consistently favour reparation by payment rather than the death penalty for murder and other serious offences (by either sex).\\" There are annalistic examples of the justice of the Cáin Adomnáin being applied, such as here by Cenél nEógain High King Niall Glúndub, for whom the O'Neill Clan of Ulster are named. * In 907 the sanctuary of Ard Macha was violated by Cearnachan mac Duilgen who took a captive from the church and drowned him in Lough Cier nearby. * This perpetrator was taken by Nial Glundub mac Aedha, Righ an Tuaisceirt, having replaced his brother Domnall as king of the north, and he drowned Cearnachan in the same lake Lough Cier in revenge for the violation of Padraicc.

He travelled to Norway and consulted the famous polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen that had sailed the furthest north with the Colin Archer built polar ship Fram in 1893-96. In 1899 Amedo bought Jason, renamed her Stella Polare and took her to Colin Archer's shipyard. The interior was stripped out and beams, diagonals and knees heavily strengthened the ship. At the same time, Colin Archer fitted out Southern Cross for polar expeditions and the two ships lay side by side at the yard in Larvik. Amedeo gathered an expeditionary crew of Italian and Norwegian civilians and sailed from Christiana on 12 June of that year. By the 30th, they had reached Archangel, Russia to load sled dogs onto the ship.Paine, Lincoln P. Ships of Discovery and Exploration. New York: Mariner, 2000. 131. Leaving Russia, they headed for Franz Josef Land. They landed in Teplitz Bay in Rudolf Island, with a hope to establish a winter camp for the expedition. From here, they established a string of camps designed to supply each other with food and men. During the expedition, Amedeo lost two fingers to frostbite, and had to hand command of the voyage over to Captain Umberto Cagni.Edwards, Deltus M. The Toll of the Arctic Seas. New York: Henry Holt, 1910. 387-388. On 25 April 1900, Cagni planted the Italian flag at 86°34'N, claiming the title of \\"Farthest North.\\" Amedo's uncle was murdered and the widow made a silver replica of Stella Polare at a cost of 12.000 lire and placed it at the virgin Marias wonder working picture in the cathedral of Torino, Italy. In July 1909 the Stella Polare was given as training ship for an association in Rome. She was taken under tow from the arsenal in Spezia and anchored at Ripa Grande in river Tiber, a little upstream of the Aventinerhights. There she caught fire, but a part of the bow was saved and put in the museum of Milano.

It is often used by beginning shooters for target practice and for hunting small game. Description It takes 20 lead balls of the diameter of a 20-gauge shotgun bore to equal one pound, while it only takes 12 lead balls of the diameter of a 12-gauge shotgun bore to equal the same weight. A 20-gauge shotgun is more suitable for hunting certain types of game or for some hunters because it recoils less, and the guns weigh less and may be smaller. Specifications 20-gauge shotguns are especially suitable for hunting game birds such as quail, grouse, turkey, and other game when using shot shells. A 20-gauge can also shoot slugs and buckshot and thereby become an effective deer-hunting gun. While shotguns loaded with slugs are usually less accurate than rifles they often have better stopping power at short range—although this depends on the amount of propellant in the shell's load. Performance In addition, 20-gauge shotguns have less recoil than 10-, 12-, or 16-gauge versions on average, and may be more desirable to those who want to experience less recoil for prolonged shooting. The lower recoil also makes a 20-gauge appropriate for younger (or conversely, middle-aged or elderly) shooters who may have a difficult time firing a larger shotgun. However, recoil is also dependent on the weight of the gun itself; for instance, a 20-gauge can have more recoil than an 12-gauge. This is widely considered a flaw in the design of so-called 'youth' guns.

Discovery and naming Remains of this small, poorly known perhaps saurolophine dinosaur were first discovered during the 1940s, from extensive erosional outcrops of the lower unnamed member of the Mooreville Chalk Formation (Selma Group; lower and middle Campanian) in Dallas County, west of the town of Selma, Alabama. The taxon has since also been reported from Black Creek Formation (Campanian) of North Carolina. The holotype, which is housed in the collections of the Field Museum in Chicago, consists of a fragmentary and disarticulated skull and incomplete postcranial skeleton. The length on the holotype specimen has been estimated as . The genus was named by Wann Langston in 1960. It was thought to be the only species of hadrosaur from that fossil formation, until 2016 with the discovery of the primitive hadrosaur, Eotrachodon orientalis. The name Lophorhothon means \\"crested nose\\" (Greek lophos meaning 'crested' and rhothon meaning 'nose'). The type species is Lophorhothon atopus. The specific name is derived from Greek atopos, \\"uncommon\\" or \\"strange\\". Taxonomic status Since the publication of Langston's description of Lophorhothon a number of workers have questioned the validity of this genus. It has been suggested, for example, that the material may actually represent a juvenile Prosaurolophus. James Lamb in 1998 has suggested the genus may actually represent a basal iguanodont, an idea that has failed to find widespread acceptance. More recent workers (Horner, Weishampel, and Forster, 2004) have classified Lophorhothon as a basal hadrosaurine and a sister taxon to all other hadrosaurines. An analysis published in 2010 indicated it was a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea.A. Prieto-Marquez and G. C. Salinas, 2010, \\"A re-evaluation of Secernosaurus koerneri and Kritosaurus australis (Dinosauria, Hadrosauridae) from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 30(3): 813–837 Holotype The specimen which Langston designated as the holotype was discovered by Rainier Zangerl, Bill Turnbull and Charles Barber on a Field Museum expedition in 1946 and was given catalogue number FMNH P 27383. It consists of less than one half of the skull, a number of vertebrae, and significant portions of the fore- and hindlimbs. Preserved cranial material includes a partial quadrate, left maxilla, teeth, jugal, lacrimal, nasal (with the namesake crest), postorbital, frontal, prefrontal, parietal, squamosal, and paroccipital process and a portion of the predentary bone. The specimen was likely washed out to sea by a river, where it eventually sank and was buried in the silty carbonate sediments of the Mississippi embayment.

On the left side is a realistic two-person suit. Bear suits are a type of costumed character or creature suit resembling a bear. They are a popular choice of mascot, and both stylized and realistic bear suits are commonly used in film and on stage, due to the bear's prominent role in the arts and entertainment. Specific types of bear suits are also used in activism, such as polar bear suits to draw attention to the threat of global warming.  History  Masked bearskin costumes were used by shamans in ritual dances by native peoples of the Pacific Northwest, such as the Tlingit, alongside those of other animals. In Romania, dancers wearing real bearskins are a pre-Christian tradition that is meant to drive away evil spirits.  Modern use  Bear suits are common as mascots for sports teams, such as Cornell University's Touchdown the Bear, which replaced an actual bear cub that was used up until the 1930s. Realistic and sometimes animatronic bear suits of all types are typically used in film, or as costumed characters. For the nature film Born in China, the filmmakers themselves were required to wear panda suits in order to get close to pandas that had never seen a human before. A realistic two-person polar bear suit was created for the 2011 play Greenland by the Royal National Theatre, and was later purchased by Greenpeace for £4,000 via a donation campaign. It was named Paula, and was used in short films and as a costumed character to draw public attention to global warming. In the Chessington World of Adventures amusement park, one show uses actors wearing animatronic panda suits created by Millennium FX. Bear suits have also been used in science, as researchers used one to study goats' response to predators both within and outside populated areas, and to study the effects of the increasing presence of polar bears on muskoxen due to global warming. In the Wolong National Nature Reserve in China, keepers wear panda suits to interact with cubs and teach them to live in the wild without relying on humans.  In popular culture  Bear suits are used in the production of various children's television series, such as Bear in the Big Blue House. In Disneyland, the characters Kenai and Koda from Brother Bear (2003) are portrayed by performers in bear suits. The film Brigsby Bear (2017) revolves around a fictional fake children's television show featuring a performer in a bear suit, which the main character later wears in an attempt to create a movie. A recurring segment in Late Show with David Letterman featured a \\"Guy in the Bear Suit\\" played by Donick Cary, who attempted to perform mundane tasks like hailing a cab for comedic effect.

They cover parts of Contra Costa County and western Alameda County, including the city of Oakland, but excluding Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton, and Sunol. Area code 510 was established on September 2, 1991, in a split from area code 415. On March 4, 1998, the inland portion of the East Bay was split off as area code 925. The dividing line followed the Berkeley Hills; almost everything west of the hills stayed in 510, while everything east of the hills transferred to 925. In response to projections that 510 would exhaust in the second quarter of 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission approved the addition of an overlay area code, 341, to serve the East Bay. The first central office codes in 341 became available on July 22, 2019. Ten-digit dialing became mandatory in the East Bay a month earlier, on June 22; attempts to make seven-digit calls triggered an intercept message reminding callers of the new procedure. Prior to 2019, 510 had been one of the few urbanized area codes without an overlay, making Oakland one of the few large cities where seven-digit dialing was still possible.

In response, the commission held meetings in Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward in January and February 2017 to discuss area code relief for 510. The North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA) proposed in May 2017 that CPUC relieve 510 by introducing the overlay area code 341 for the entire territory. NANPA had previously assigned 341 as the relief area code for 510 in 1999, but nationwide number pooling procedures eliminated the need at that time. The NANPA retained 341 for the then-future relief of 510. CPUC accepted the NANPA proposal in a decision on June 21, 2018. With the start of the overlay plan in July 2019, all customers in the numbering plan area can be assigned telephone numbers with either code, and must dial the area code for all calls; otherwise, a recorded message will remind them if they dial incorrectly.NANPA planning letter PL-518 for area code 341 overlay Prior usage of 510 for TWX In the United States, AT&T; originally used NPA 510 for the TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. Western Union acquired the TWX network in 1969 and renamed it Telex II.

Turnbull was originally a soldier, serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, and joined Arsenal in 1921 as an amateur. He was originally a left back and made his debut on 27 December 1921 against Cardiff City at Ninian Park; Arsenal lost 3–4 in a tightly fought game. Turnbull only played occasionally at this stage, making only five appearances in the 1921-22 season. The following season, he played a little more regularly, featuring in eight of the Gunners' first fifteen matches. At this point in time, mid-November, Arsenal were bottom of the table, having only won four matches. With Arsenal's regular striker Henry White out of form and no money available to buy a replacement, Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton switched Turnbull from defence to up front, and the gamble paid off; Turnbull scored 21 league goals that season, including two four-goal hauls against Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool. Turnbull's goals saved Arsenal from relegation and they eventually finished a comfortable 11th. An additional goal in the FA Cup against Liverpool brought Turnbull's total for the season to 22, which was then a top-flight record for an Arsenal player. However, his blistering form could not last, and he only scored six goals in 1923-24. The arrival of Harry Woods forced Turnbull out of the Arsenal side altogether and he was sold to Charlton Athletic in November 1924; in all he had scored 28 goals in 66 matches for Arsenal. After just three months at The Valley, he was sold on Chelsea, where he rediscovered his form. In less than three seasons he scored 58 goals in only 87 first-team games. After leaving Chelsea in 1928 he had brief spells at Clapton Orient, Southend United and Crystal Palace. After retiring, he stayed on with Palace as a trainer, until his death in 1946 aged 52.

Shirburn Castle - more detailed view of the frontage from the surrounding gardens. The Castle (as \\"Sherbourn Castle\\") as illustrated in John Neale's \\"Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. L.P\\", volume 3 (1818). Shirburn Castle Gatehouse. Shirburn Castle is a Grade I listed, moated castle located at the village of Shirburn, near Watlington, Oxfordshire. Originally constructed in the fourteenth century, it was renovated in the Georgian era by the first Earl of Macclesfield who made it his family seat, and again in the early nineteenth century in the \\"Gothick\\" style. The Earls of Macclesfield remained in residence until 2004, and the Castle is still (2020) owned by the Macclesfield family company. It formerly contained an important, early eighteenth century library which, along with several valuable paintings, remained in the ownership of the 9th Earl and were largely dispersed at auction following his departure from the property; notable among these items were George Stubbs's 1768 painting \\"Brood Mares and Foals\\", a record setter for the artist at auction in 2010, the Macclesfield Psalter, and personal correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton. Description and earlier history The Castle was constructed circa 1378 on the site of a previous moated grange, and the present, still moated, three storey building has a quadrangular form with four rounded corner towers. Rendered on the exterior (although the latter covering now disappeared in places), it has been stated as being the earliest brick building in Oxfordshire, although Emery, cited below, believes that the original construction was more likely built entirely in limestone, with the brick \\"casing\\" added only when the Castle was remodelled in 1720 in the Georgian style.Emery, Anthony (2006): Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300–1500: Volume 3, Southern England. Cambridge University Press. ISBN:9781139449199 It was later modified further in the early 19th century in the then popular \\"Gothick\\" style. Records state that the first licence to build the Castle was granted to Warin de Lisle in 1377. Following his death 5 years later, the Castle passed to his daughter who married Lord Berkeley, and then to her daughter who married Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, whose principal residence was Warwick Castle. Later it was owned or occupied by successive families including the Talbots, Quartremayes and FowlersThis information from a historical account \\"admirably compiled by Lady Macclesfield in a little brochure published in 1887\\" as reported in Money, 1895, p. 293. and eventually sold to the Chamberlain family, commencing with Edward Chamberlain, whose mother took out a lease on the Shirburn estate from her brother in 1505 and who died there in 1543. The Castle's next owner was Sir Leonard Chamberlain (or Chamberlayne), d.1561, who was also the Governor of Guernsey from 1553. During the English Civil War it was held by Richard Chamberlain for the King, but surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax for the Parliamentarian cause in 1646. After the end of the Civil War, the Castle remained in (or was returned to) the Chamberlain family. The last male of the line, one John Chamberlain, died in 1651, leaving no sons but two co-heirs via the female line, his daughters Elizabeth, wife of John Neville, Lord [A]bergavenny, and Mary, who was married first to Sir Thomas Gage of Firle, Sussex, and later to Sir Henry Goring. Elizabeth and Lord Abergavenny (d. 1662) possessed the manorial rights there until Elizabeth's death (date not known); by 1682 both Elizabeth and Mary had died and the castle passed to Joseph Gage (1652–1700), Mary's fourth son by her first husband, Thomas Gage.Burke, John, 1839. A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire. 6th Edition. Henry Colburn, London. The Castle then continued as the seat of that branch of the Gage family until 1714, when the eldest son Thomas Gage succeeded his wife Elizabeth's late father to the estate of High Meadow, a property in Gloucestershire, and associated \\"considerable fortune\\"; at this time he decided to sell Shirburn, and in 1716 the Castle was acquired by Thomas Parker, Baron (later to be the first Earl) of Macclesfield and subsequently Lord Chancellor of England from 1718-1725,Victoria County History, London, 1964: A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 8, Lewknor and Pyrton Hundreds: Parishes: Shirburn (pp. 178-198). Available online at https://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/oxon/vol8/pp178-198. the purchase price (for Shirburn plus another property, Clare manor) being £25,696 8s. 5d. (more than £2 million in recent money), and thenceforth the Castle becoming the seat of the Earls of Macclesfield (and/or their associated family company) to the present time. The then very wealthy, soon-to-be first Earl was responsible for extensive renovations to the Castle (considered by some authors to be a substantial rebuild, see below), costing a further five thousand pounds, and also commenced assembly of the Castle's extensive and important library, which was to survive intact for almost 300 years until its dispersal. The Earls of Macclesfield are (or at least were) protective of their privacy, allowing few visitors to see the inside of the castle and denying requests for access for an examination to scholars of medieval architecture, with the result that Anthony Emery wrote in 2006: \\"Shirburn Castle has a well deserved reputation for being barred to all students of architecture ...Consequently, the castle has never been studied in detail ...The list [of persons denied entry] extends from Lord Torrington in 1775 to Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural staff of Country Life, and the Department of the Environment recorders 200 years later. ...Not surprisingly, Shirburn has been ignored by all writers on castles except for the summaries of ownership by Sir James Mackenzie, The Castles of England, 1 (1897) 163-5 and Sir Charles Oman, Castles (1926) 46-9\\". (It should also be noted that the list of excluded persons also included Emery himself, who was unable to report further on the interior.) The medieval entrance hall, a surviving room from the pre-eighteenth century Castle, was previously illustrated by J. Skelton \\"after F. Mackenzie\\" and published in Skelton's Antiquities of Oxfordshire in 1824 (see \\"external links\\").

Yale University Press, 352 pp. ISBN:9780300248685 Fortunately for history, one record of a successful nineteenth century visit survives, in the form of Walter Money's report \\"A Walk to Shirburn Castle\\", from the Journal of the British Archaeological Association for December 1895, which describes the interior in some detail from p. 290 onwards, especially with regard to some particular items of interest in the armoury, plus an extensive list of the more important portraits and other pictures to be seen in various rooms, together with a description and illustration of a Roman sarcophagus originally found in the garden, being used as a pedestal.Money, Walter, 1895.

Available online at https://archive.org/stream/journalofbritishns01brit#page/n370/mode/1up Emery postulates that after Thomas Parker purchased the Castle in 1716, the latter's renovations probably affected more than three-quarters of the Castle, with the result that what stands at Shirburn today is \\"essentially an eighteenth- century interpretation of the medieval castle, following its original plan\\", although he allows that the main (west) front with its gate-tower, and the lower stages of two of the other towers, are likely to be survivors from the original fourteenth-century building.Emery, 2006, pp. 153-154.

Here he built an observatory and a chemical laboratory. The observatory was \\"equipped with the finest existing instruments\\" and the 2nd Earl of Macclesfield used it from 1740. In 1761 the astronomer Thomas Hornsby observed the transit of Venus from the castle grounds.

Twentieth century and beyond Under a tax minimisation arrangement, ownership of the castle was transferred to the Beechwood Estates Company, the Macclesfield family estate management company, in 1922, with equity divided among the family members; unfortunately for the succession, however, this had the result of decoupling ownership and automatic right to occupy the Castle from inheritance of the title, and in the early twenty-first century, following a long-running and acrimonious court battle, Richard Timothy George Mansfield Parker, the 9th Earl of Macclesfield and last member of the family to reside at the Castle, was evicted from the family seat by the other family members, departing in 2005.Neutral Citation Number: [2003] EWHC 1846 (Ch), accessed 18 December 2012.Godfrey Barker: Who's laughing now?

It is an agricultural community, and is known particularly for its production of prickly pears. Geography Located in the south-eastern corner of the province, close to the provinces of Caltanissetta and Enna, San Cono borders with the municipalities of Mazzarino (CL), Piazza Armerina (EN) and San Michele di Ganzaria. History The town was named San Cono in 1785 by its founder, the Duke of Trigonia Marquis Ottavio Trigona Bellotti. In 1883, the territory was divided into several parts and rented to the town's inhabitants. The town belonged to the Trigonia family until the abolition of feudal rights. The town is named after San Cono Abate, although the reason for naming the town after this saint is not clear; according to Jesuit Father Ignazio Mario Piccolo, the fiefdom \\"was named after San Cono because it was first owned by the Santapau family, who were decedents of the Saint\\" and the same is reported by the historian Carlo Incudine. Although there are no documents to prove this hypothesis. Ottavio Trigona (although busy with the administration of Piazza Armerina, the neighbouring town) never neglected the interests of the feud of San Cono. To further explain the name of the town and the historically uncertain reasons of the foundation, there is a popular legend. It is said that one day the Marquis Trigona received a visit from a Friar of Naso who belonged to the Order of St. Basil to buy a large amount of wheat. Not being able to pay in full, the Friar left a precious ring he wore on his finger as a pledge to the Marquis, with the promise that he would then pay the debt. He then loaded the grain onto the mule and left. But after a long period of time the Marquis, having no longer been visited by the monk (and beginning to doubt his good faith), decided to go personally to Naso to ask for information; yet no one was able to tell him anything about the Friar. Once he began his return, on a wall of a Convent, he found the monk depicted in a picture. It was San Cono, who died more than five centuries earlier. Convinced that he witnessed a miracle, he decided to found the town and give it the name of the saint. The Marquis had a church and 60 houses built at his own expense, where he welcomed people from all over Sicily with the promise of a house and a piece of land to cultivate; therefore, many men who had problems with the law replied to the marquis's proclamation to rebuild their lives. Ottavio Trigona asked and obtained a \\"licentia populandi\\"(This was a concession or permit by the Kingdom of Sicily, for barons or feudal lords to allow them the privilege of populating a feud. Shortly after, he provided the means for the construction of the Church of San Cono. Main sights The Monument to the Fallen is situated in the centre of the public square. It was constructed between 1967 and 1968 to commemorate those who lost their lives in the world wars. Chiesa Madre is the town's oldest church, presumably dating back to the 18th century. The altar has a statue of Saint Cono, and the Trigonia coat of arms carved into the sides. The church's ceiling features paintings representing the life of the saint. The Palace Trigonia was built by the Trigona family as a seasonal residence in the center of the fiefdom of San Cono Soprano with an animation of the peasants and the person in charge of the small block. Around it, where \\"U Bagghiu\\" was born in the center, there are the stables and warehouses with a watering trough for the animals whose water is tested by the Vallone Mira. Today the Trigona palace is found to be divided into various owners, who over the years have made profound changes without taking into account its historical and cultural value. Culture The patronal feast of St. Cono Abbate is held on the second and third weekends of May. A major festival in San Cono is the \\"Sagra del Fico d'India\\" (which translates to the Festival of the Prickly Pears), held on the first Sunday in October each year.

The theory was introduced by for nilpotent groups and later extended by Bertram Kostant, Louis Auslander, Lajos Pukánszky and others to the case of solvable groups. Roger Howe found a version of the orbit method that applies to p-adic Lie groups. David Vogan proposed that the orbit method should serve as a unifying principle in the description of the unitary duals of real reductive Lie groups.  Relation with symplectic geometry  One of the key observations of Kirillov was that coadjoint orbits of a Lie group G have natural structure of symplectic manifolds whose symplectic structure is invariant under G. If an orbit is the phase space of a G-invariant classical mechanical system then the corresponding quantum mechanical system ought to be described via an irreducible unitary representation of G. Geometric invariants of the orbit translate into algebraic invariants of the corresponding representation. In this way the orbit method may be viewed as a precise mathematical manifestation of a vague physical principle of quantization. In the case of a nilpotent group G the correspondence involves all orbits, but for a general G additional restrictions on the orbit are necessary (polarizability, integrality, Pukánszky condition). This point of view has been significantly advanced by Kostant in his theory of geometric quantization of coadjoint orbits.  Kirillov character formula  For a Lie group G, the Kirillov orbit method gives a heuristic method in representation theory. It connects the Fourier transforms of coadjoint orbits, which lie in the dual space of the Lie algebra of G, to the infinitesimal characters of the irreducible representations. The method got its name after the Russian mathematician Alexandre Kirillov. At its simplest, it states that a character of a Lie group may be given by the Fourier transform of the Dirac delta function supported on the coadjoint orbits, weighted by the square-root of the Jacobian of the exponential map, denoted by j. It does not apply to all Lie groups, but works for a number of classes of connected Lie groups, including nilpotent, some semisimple groups, and compact groups.  Special cases   Nilpotent group case  Let G be a connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie group. Kirillov proved that the equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G are parametrized by the coadjoint orbits of G, that is the orbits of the action G on the dual space \\\\mathfrak{g}^* of its Lie algebra. The Kirillov character formula expresses the Harish-Chandra character of the representation as a certain integral over the corresponding orbit.  Compact Lie group case  Complex irreducible representations of compact Lie groups have been completely classified. They are always finite-dimensional, unitarizable (i.e. admit an invariant positive definite Hermitian form) and are parametrized by their highest weights, which are precisely the dominant integral weights for the group. If G is a compact semisimple Lie group with a Cartan subalgebra h then its coadjoint orbits are closed and each of them intersects the positive Weyl chamber h*+ in a single point. An orbit is integral if this point belongs to the weight lattice of G. The highest weight theory can be restated in the form of a bijection between the set of integral coadjoint orbits and the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G: the highest weight representation L(λ) with highest weight λ∈h*+ corresponds to the integral coadjoint orbit G·λ.

The genus, circumscribed by Swiss botanist Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli in 1857, contains 81 species. Most parasitise insects and other arthropods, and the best-known Nosema species parasitise honeybees, where they are considered a significant disease by beekeepers, often causing a colony to fail to thrive in the spring as they come out of their overwintering period.

Chambers played predominantly as a right-back, although he also played at centre-back, left-back and right-wing during his career. He last played for Worcester City. Career Chambers' early career mirrored that of his twin brother Adam Chambers. Both played for school football teams - Grove Vale Primary School and Dartmouth High School, West Bromwich District and Sunday league team - Holy Name F.C. before joining West Bromwich Albion in 1996, and signing for West Bromwich Albion as apprentices in July 1997. West Bromwich Albion After progressing through Albion's youth system, both twins turned professional in January 1999. James made his debut in a 0–0 draw with Port Vale on 15 January 2000. He made 78 appearances in total for the Baggies, with a significant number coming in the 2000–01 season. In the 1998–99 season he and his brother Adam became the first twins to represent England at any level when they appeared together during the World Youth Tournament in Nigeria. They were also the first twins to play for the Albion, and the first to play in same side for any club in the Premier League. Watford With few chances available at the newly promoted Premiership side, he was allowed to move to Championship side Watford on loan in August 2004.Player Profile: James Chambers Chambers impressed manager Ray Lewington enough to sign him on a permanent three-year contract in a deal worth up to £250,000.Hornets land Chambers Chambers started regularly in his first season at the club and also featured in the club's run to the League Cup semi-finals that year. He scored his only two career goals to date (as of December 2010) in the 4th round 5–2 victory over Premiership side Southampton.Watford 5–2 Southampton He also played in the quarter-final victory over Portsmouth and semi-final defeat to Liverpool. Chambers competed with Lloyd Doyley for the right-back spot in 2005–06, as well as spending some time playing at left- back. Watford reached the play-offs, finishing third, and Chambers started on the right-wing in the semi-final first leg against Crystal Palace, putting in an impressive display.Report: Crystal Palace vs Watford He kept his place for the second leg and the final, against Leeds United, where his deflected strike led to an own goal by Leeds goalkeeper Neil Sullivan.Leeds 0–3 Watford Watford won 3–0, and were promoted to the Premiership. In the post-match dressing room celebrations, Sky cameras inadvertently showed Chambers fully naked – exposing his private parts on national television – whilst jumping around and spraying manager Aidy Boothroyd with champagne.Watford celebrations Chambers started Watford's first game in the top-flight, a 2–1 loss to Everton where he was substituted at half-time. Aside from a League Cup appearance against Accrington Stanley, he did not play another first team match until he joined Cardiff on a month's loan in October 2006. Playing as a left back for the early Championship leaders, he started all seven games in his time at Ninian Park. Watford then rejected Cardiff's request to extend the loan. penalty kick in an M69 derby at the Ricoh Arena He returned to the Watford side at right- back, but sustained an injury against Newcastle United that kept him out of the team until March. He featured sporadically after that, as Watford were relegated from the Premiership, but did play in the side's FA Cup quarter- final victory over Plymouth Argyle and semi-final loss to Manchester United. Leicester City In June 2007 Chambers turned down a new contract at Watford to sign a three-year contract with fellow Championship side Leicester City. Doncaster Rovers On 4 August 2008, Chambers signed a three-year- deal with Doncaster Rovers.

He became Rovers' seventh signing of the summer, leading up to their first season back in the second tier of English football after fifty years in the lower leagues. Chambers was a regular for Rovers throughout the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, with his ability to play on either side of the back four adding some much needed versatility to the Rovers ranks. Rehabilitation from a knee operation caused him to miss the beginning of the 2010–11 season. Walsall After a period on trial at the club, Chambers joined League One side Walsall on 18 August 2012, again linking up with his brother Adam.

He served as Gauleiter of Reichsgau Kärnten and Landeshauptmann (premier) of Carinthia from 1938-39. Early years Born in Raibl (today: Cave del Predil, Tarvisio) in the Carinthian Val Canale, the son of minor customs official, he attended the Gymnasium in Villach. Taking his Matura exams in 1912, he completed his military service as an Einjährig- Freiwilliger (\\"one-year volunteer\\") in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Thereafter he served in World War I in the rank of a Leutnant in Galicia, where he was seriously wounded in 1915. He reached the rank of Oberleutnant at the Italian Front. In 1916 he was transferred to the reserve, commanding casualty assemblies in Klagenfurt and Trento. When the war ended, Klausner from 1919 fought in the Volkswehr paramilitary forces in the armed conflicts against Yugoslav troops, which led to the Carinthian Plebiscite of 1920. Afterwards he joined the Federal Army of the First Austrian Republic and was promoted to the rank of Hauptmann (Captain). In 1930 he was promoted to Major, the highest rank that he would reach in the Austrian Army before he had to leave for political reasons in 1933. Austrian Nazi Party Having initially joined the Greater German People's Party, he switched to the Austrian Nazi Party in 1922, which he left in 1927. In February 1931, he once again joined the NSDAP, which won influence in local council and provincial elections in Carinthia in 1931 and 1932. Klausner was an early and ardent proponent of Nazism in Carinthia. He was appointed Deputy Gauleiter in January 1933, Bezirksleiter (District Leader) of Klagenfurt in March, and on 5 May 1933, he advanced to the position of Gauleiter of the still-outlawed Nazi Party in Carinthia. Klausner's influence grew during the incarceration of Austrian Nazi Party Leader (Landesleiter) Josef Leopold in 1935-1936 and he was viewed by some as the de facto party leader.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust), R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, p. 82, . During the time of Austrofascism in the Federal State of Austria (Ständestaat), Klausner was interned for a few months several times in 1935, 1936 and 1937. His arrests for political reasons however, could not keep him from further advancing the Nazi movement. His home in Latschach near Finkenstein became a venue for meetings with other leading Carinthian Nazis such as Friedrich Rainer and Odilo Globocnik. Klausner resigned as Gauleiter on 9 October 1936 in a policy dispute with Leopold, who favored a more independent Austrian approach as opposed to the Greater-German ideas of Klausner and his associates. Things reached a climax on 21 February 1938 when Leopold was removed as Landesleiter of the Nazi Party by Adolf Hitler and replaced with Klausner. Anschluss On the eve of the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany on 12 March 1938, Klausner received Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler at the Vienna airport. Klausner announced the Anschluss on Austrian radio and joined the SS immediately afterwards, in the rank of Oberführer. The next day, Klausner was appointed by the new Nazi Chancellor Arthur Seyss-Inquart to be \\"Minister for Political Decision Making\\" in the first Nazi cabinet. Upon the German election on 10 April, he obtained a seat in the Reichstag. On 23 April he became deputy to Josef Bürckel, the Reichskommissar for the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich. Then, on 22 May he again was named Gauleiter of Gau Carinthia, and also became deputy to Bürckel in his capacity as Reichsstatthalter of Ostmark. Along with all this, he also attained, as of 1 June 1938, the office of Landeshauptmann of Carinthia. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jurisdiction. While he was in Vienna assisting Bürckel, his duties as Gauleiter and Landeshauptmann were exercised by his deputies Franz Kutschera and Wladimir von Pawlowski, respectively. On 9 November 1938, Klausner was promoted to SS- Brigadeführer. At the height of his power, Hubert Klausner died suddenly on 12 February 1939 in his home in Vienna, officially of a stroke. Adolf Hitler together with Reinhard Heydrich and Rudolf Hess attended Klausner's state funeral in Klagenfurt, where Hitler delivered the commemorative address.

Scarred Lands draws heavy inspiration from Greek mythology. Setting The setting is set on the world of Scarn in a post-apocalyptic era where the world is recovering from a horrific war between the Gods and Titans, which ended 150 years ago and left the land warped. In need of a way to rid the world of the whimsical and dangerous titans, the gods - the children of the titans - decided to unite against their parents. However, the essence of the titans are inseparably bound to the world of Scarn, since they are the world's creators, and so the gods are obliged to simply incapacitate their parents instead of destroying them. Hacked to pieces and/or chained, the felled titans are a constant incentive for the titan-worshippers to resurrect their masters and for the divine races to continue fighting against the titanic abominations. A great deal of the system's appeal comes from the detail of cultures, cities, governments and history given by the module books. There are also several continents which have been influenced in a lesser degree by the Titan/God war.  Titans  In the game structure, Titans have neither alignment, nor domains. Titans as described through the game are akin to raw natural and universal power. * Denev, the Earth Mother * Chern, The Scourge * Gaurak, the Glutton * Golthagga, the Shaper * Golthain, the Faceless * Gormoth, the Writhing Lord * Gulaben, Lady of the Winds * Hrinruuk, the Hunter * Kadum, the Mountainshaker * Lethene, Dame of Storms * Mesos, Sire of Sorcery * Mormo, Mother of Serpents * Thulkas, Father of Fire  Gods  While the Titans are kin to raw and universal power, the children of the Titans are not. Being a generation away from spontaneous birth is enough to limit the child to godhood in this game setting. Each God in the system therefore follows the d20 System rules for gods and NPCs, having both alignment and domains. This is also true of the Titan Denev who supported the gods in their war. Another difference in the Scarred Lands system, from other d20 System, is the interaction, and 'awareness' of the Gods by the populations of the sentient beings. Like the land itself, the gods and titans are both major influences of the game. Blacksmiths for example invoke the name of Corean while they work. This in itself may not be different, for game purposes each round that the worshipper invokes his name a +1 may be added to die rolls for: Craft or Profession if the act involves blacksmithing, forging, or the creation of weapons. Other benefits are also described in the Scarred Lands Campaign Setting: Ghelspad book, and in The Divine and the Defeated published by White Wolf Publishing. * Corean, the Avenger—LG: Fire, Good, Law, Protection, War * Madriel, the Redeemer—NG: Air, Good, Healing, Plant, Sun * Tanil, the Huntress—CG: Animal, Chaos, Luck, Plant, Travel, Trickery * Hedrada, the Lawgiver—LN: Judgment, Knowledge, Law, Protection * Enkili, the Trickster—CN: Air, Chaos, Luck, Travel, Trickery * Chardun, the Slaver—LE: Domination, Evil, Law, Strength, War * Belsameth, the Slayer—NE: Death, Evil, Magic, Trickery * Vangal, the Reaver—CE: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, Strength, War * Denev, the Earth Mother—N: Air, Animals, Earth, Fire, Plants, Water (Denev Is actually a Titan, but fought alongside the gods in the Titanswar, and can be worshipped as a goddess)  The Land  While many role-playing game systems work with weather types and terrain difficulties, the Scarred Lands system brings in the aspect of land as an NPC (Non-Player Character). There are two continents published in a book apiece, Ghelspad and Termana; and three more collected in the last book, Asherak, the Dragon Isles, and Fenrilik. Ghelspad is temperate. Termana is tropical. Asherak is desert. Fenrilik is arctic.  Novels  The Dead God Trilogy by Richard Lee Byers comprises the titles Forsaken, Forsworn, and Forbidden. It recounts the story of an elf (Vladawen Titanslayer) and his companions as they try to deliver their people from a devastating curse by resurrecting the high elven god killed during the Divine War by the titan Chern the Scourge.

Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, professors at INSEAD, and the name of the marketing theory detailed on the book. They assert that these strategic moves create a leap in value for the company, its buyers, and its employees while unlocking new demand and making the competition irrelevant. The book presents analytical frameworks and tools to foster an organization's ability to systematically create and capture \\"blue oceans\\"—unexplored new market areas. An expanded edition of the book was published in 2015, while a sequel entitled Blue Ocean Shift was published in 2017.  Book layout and concepts  The book is divided into three parts: 1\\\\. The first part presents key concepts of blue ocean strategy, including Value Innovation – the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost – and key analytical tools and frameworks such as the strategy canvas and the four actions framework. The four actions framework aids in eliminating the trade-off between differentiation and low cost within a company. The four actions framework consists of the following: *Raise: This questions which factors must be raised within an industry in terms of product, pricing or service standards. *Eliminate: This questions which areas of a company or industry could be completely eliminated to reduce costs and to create an entirely new market. *Reduce: This questions which areas of a company’s product or service are not entirely necessary but play a significant role in your industry, for example, the cost of manufacturing a certain material for a product could be reduced. Therefore, it can be reduced without completely eliminating it. *Create: This prompts companies to be innovative with their products. By creating an entirely new product or service, a company can create their own market through differentiation from the competition. 2\\\\. The second part describes the four principles of blue ocean strategy formulation. These four formulation principles address how an organization can create blue oceans by looking across the six conventional boundaries of competition (Six Paths Framework), reduce their planning risk by following the four steps of visualizing strategy, create new demand by unlocking the three tiers of noncustomers and launch a commercially viable blue ocean idea by aligning unprecedented utility of an offering with strategic pricing and target costing and by overcoming adoption hurdles. The book uses many examples across industries to demonstrate how to break out of traditional competitive (structuralist) strategic thinking and to grow demand and profits for the company and the industry by using blue ocean (reconstructionist) strategic thinking. The four principles are: # how to create uncontested market space by reconstructing market boundaries, # focusing on the big picture, # reaching beyond existing demand and supply in new market spaces # getting the strategic sequence right. 3\\\\. The third and final part describes the two key implementation principles of blue ocean strategy including tipping point leadership and fair process. These implementation principles are essential for leaders to overcome the four key organizational hurdles that can prevent even the best strategies from being executed. The four key hurdles comprise the cognitive, resource, motivational and political hurdles that prevent people involved in strategy execution from understanding the need to break from status quo, finding the resources to implement the new strategic shift, keeping your people committed to implementing the new strategy, and from overcoming the powerful vested interests that may block the change. Proposition In the book the authors draw the attention of their readers towards the correlation of success stories across industries and the formulation of strategies that provide a solid base to create unconventional success – a strategy termed as \\"blue ocean strategy\\". Unlike the \\"red ocean strategy\\", the conventional approach to business of beating competition derived from the military organization, the \\"blue ocean strategy\\" tries to align innovation with utility, price and cost positions. The book mocks at the phenomena of conventional choice between product/service differentiation and lower cost, but rather suggests that both differentiation and lower costs are achievable simultaneously. The authors ask readers \\"What is the best unit of analysis of profitable growth? Company? Industry?\\" – a fundamental question without which any strategy for profitable growth is not worthwhile. The authors justify with original and practical ideas that neither the company nor the industry is the best unit of analysis of profitable growth; rather it is the strategic move that creates \\"blue ocean\\" and sustained high performance. The book examines the experience of companies in areas as diverse as watches, wine, cement, computers, automobiles, textiles, coffee makers, airlines, retailers, and even the circus, to answer this fundamental question and builds upon the argument about \\"value innovation\\" being the cornerstone of a blue ocean strategy. Value innovation is necessarily the alignment of innovation with utility, price and cost positions. This creates uncontested market space and makes competition irrelevant. The new chapters in the expanded edition of the book deal with the issues of how to develop and align the three strategy propositions of value, profit and people, how to sustain and renew blue ocean strategy at both the business level and the corporate level, and how to avoid red ocean traps that keep organizations anchored in existing market space even as they attempt to create new market space. The following section discusses the concept behind the book in detail.  Concept  Cirque du Soleil – an example of creating a new market space, by blending opera and ballet with the circus format while eliminating star performers and animals. The metaphor of red and blue oceans describes the market universe. Red oceans represent all the industries in existence today – the known market space. In the red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known. Here companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of product or service demand. As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities or niche, and cutthroat competition turns the ocean bloody; hence, the term \\"red oceans\\". Blue oceans, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. Blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential of market space that is not yet explored. The cornerstone of blue ocean strategy is \\"value innovation\\", a concept originally outlined in Kim & Mauborgne's 1997 article \\"Value Innovation - The Strategic Logic of High Growth\\". Value innovation is the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost, creating value for both the buyer, the company, and its employees, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space. The aim of value innovation, as articulated in the article, is not to compete, but to make the competition irrelevant by changing the playing field of strategy. The strategic move must raise and create value for the market, while simultaneously reducing or eliminating features or services that are less valued by the current or future market. The Four Actions Framework is used to help create value innovation and break the value- cost trade-off. Value innovation challenges Michael Porter's idea that successful businesses are either low-cost providers or niche-players. Instead, blue ocean strategy proposes finding value that crosses conventional market segmentation and offering value and lower cost. Educator Charles W. L. Hill proposed a similar idea in 1988 and claimed that Porter's model was flawed because differentiation can be a means for firms to achieve low cost. He proposed that a combination of differentiation and low cost might be necessary for firms to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Many others have proposed similar strategies. For example, Swedish educators Jonas Ridderstråle and Kjell Nordström in their 1999 book Funky Business follow a similar line of reasoning. For example, \\"competing factors\\" in blue ocean strategy are similar to the definition of \\"finite and infinite dimensions\\" in Funky Business. Just as blue ocean strategy claims that a red ocean strategy does not guarantee success, Funky Business explained that \\"Competitive Strategy is the route to nowhere\\". Funky Business argues that firms need to create \\"sensational strategies\\". Just like blue ocean strategy, a sensational strategy is about \\"playing a different game\\" according to Ridderstråle and Nordström. Ridderstråle and Nordström also claim that the aim of companies is to create temporary monopolies. Kim and Mauborgne explain that the aim of companies is to create blue oceans, that will eventually turn red. This is the same idea expressed in the form of an analogy. Ridderstråle and Nordström also claimed in 1999 that \\"in the slow-growth 1990s overcapacity is the norm in most businesses\\". Kim and Mauborgne claim that blue ocean strategy makes sense in a world where supply exceeds demand.  Blue ocean vs. red ocean  Kim and Mauborgne argue that while traditional competition-based strategies (red ocean strategies) are necessary, they are not sufficient to sustain high performance. Companies need to go beyond competing. To seize new profit and growth opportunities they also need to create blue oceans. The authors argue that competition based strategies assume that an industry's structural conditions are given and that firms are forced to compete within them, an assumption based on what academics call the structuralist view, or environmental determinism. To sustain themselves in the marketplace, practitioners of red ocean strategy focus on building advantages over the competition, usually by assessing what competitors do and striving to do it better. Here, grabbing a bigger share of the market is seen as a zero-sum game in which one company's gain is achieved at another company’s loss. Hence, competition, the supply side of the equation, becomes the defining variable of strategy. Here, cost and value are seen as trade-offs and a firm chooses a distinctive cost or differentiation position. Because the total profit level of the industry is also determined by structural factors, firms principally seek to capture and redistribute wealth instead of creating wealth. They focus on dividing up the red ocean, where growth is increasingly limited. Blue ocean strategy, on the other hand, is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players. This is what the authors call the reconstructionist view. Assuming that structure and market boundaries exist only in managers’ minds, practitioners who hold this view do not let existing market structures limit their thinking. To them, extra demand is out there, largely untapped. The crux of the problem is how to create it. This, in turn, requires a shift of attention from supply to demand, from a focus on competing to a focus on value innovation – that is, the creation of innovative value to unlock new demand. This is achieved via the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low-cost. As market structure is changed by breaking the value/cost tradeoff, so are the rules of the game. Competition in the old game is therefore rendered irrelevant. By expanding the demand side of the economy, new wealth is created. Such a strategy therefore allows firms to largely play a non–zero-sum game, with high payoff possibilities.  History of the concept  The concept has initially been developed in the 1990s when W. Chan Kim was taking part in a consulting project for Philips headed by the management scholar C.K. Prahalad. Working with consultants from the Mac Group (a consulting company that was later bought by Capgemini), he has developed strategy tools leading to the publication of a serie of articles in the Harvard Business Review, and then in 2005 of the Blue Ocean Strategy book.  Reception  Since Blue Ocean Strategy was published in 2005 it has been translated into 43 languages and has sold over 3.5 million copies. The book was named a bestseller by the Wall Street Journal, BusinessWeek, and Amazon.com. It was selected as one of the “Best Books of 2005” by Fast Company magazine, won “The Best Business Book of 2005” Prize at the Frankfurt Book Fair, and achieved bestselling book of the decade status by 800-CEO-READ (2000-2010). Strategy+Business magazine selected it as #1 strategy book of 2005. In 2009, Blue Ocean Strategy was selected by the China Daily and the China Research Institute as one of the 40 most influential books in the History of the People's Republic of China (1949-2009) along with Adam Smith’s ″The Wealth of Nations″ under the category of ″Economics and Finance.″ In 2010, Polish group ThinkTank selected Blue Ocean Strategy as one of the Top 20 books that have shaped Polish Leaders. Blue Ocean Strategy won the Thinkers50 2011 Strategy Award for Best Business Book of the decade and in the same year, it was introduced to the Fast Company Leadership Hall of Fame. In 2013, the book received the GoodBooks Award in the Management category by the Vietnamese Institute for Research on Education Development (IRED), was selected as one of the 15 Best Business Books of the last decade in Russia by the Kommersant.ru magazine, and selected as one of the top three best management books in Japan by the Diamond Harvard Business Review. The Wall Street Journal recommends Blue Ocean Strategy for the top manager. Forbes calls it one of the ten business trends for 2013 and argues that \\"blue ocean strategies are more influential than ever.\\" BusinessWeek says that \\"Blue Ocean Strategy will have you wondering why companies need so much persuasion to stay out of shark- infested waters.\\" The Business Strategy Review said the book \\"challenges everything you knew about strategy\\", and the Business Times called on firms to \\"adopt blue ocean strategy to stay ahead.\\" Marketplace magazine recommends Blue Ocean Strategy as a book \\"you need to read.\\" In addition, the book has received many positive reviews from various publications that include Chicago Tribune, Daily Herald, Credit Union Journal, Vancouver Sun, Association Meetings, Strategy & Leadership, and Business First, among many others.  Criticisms  While Kim and Mauborgne propose approaches to finding uncontested market space, at the present there are few success stories of companies that have actively applied their theories. One success story that does exist is Nintendo, who first applied the blue ocean strategy to create the Nintendo DS handheld game system, which was the first portable gaming system to offer dual-screen gaming and a touch screen in 2004. In 2006, Nintendo released the Wii, which used unique motion controls. The 3DS is Nintendo's third endeavour for its blue ocean strategy. Its first two attempts, the Nintendo DS and Wii, were wildly successful, becoming some of the biggest selling platforms in history. Nintendo revealed their Blue Ocean Strategy during an E3 press conference during the hype build-up of the Wii. With just one case study, however, this hole in their data persists despite the publication of value innovation concepts dating back to 1997. Hence, a critical question is whether this book and its related ideas are descriptive rather than prescriptive. The authors present many examples of successful innovations, and then explain from their Blue Ocean perspective – essentially interpreting success through their lenses. The research process followed by the authors has been criticized on several grounds. Criticisms include claims that no control group was used, that there is no way to know how many companies using a blue ocean strategy failed and the theory is thus unfalsifiable, that a deductive process was not followed, and that the examples in the book were selected to \\"tell a winning story\\". Meanwhile, several attempts at empirical validations and conceptual extensions of the blue ocean strategy have been published. Additionally, blue ocean strategy cannot be identified as true causation for success. The authors cite the strategies used by NYPD Commissioner Bratton as a key example of Blue Ocean applied in the public sector. They defined this success as a significant drop in crime in the City of New York after Bratton took office in 1994. Many social scientists would disagree that it was Bratton's policies that led to crime reduction: rather, the city was simply part of a nationwide trend in decreasing crime. Brand and communication are taken for granted and do not represent a key for success. Kim and Maubourgne take the marketing of a value innovation as a given, assuming the marketing success will come as a matter of course. It is argued that rather than a theory, blue ocean strategy is an extremely successful attempt to brand a set of already existing concepts and frameworks with a highly \\"sticky\\" idea. The blue ocean/red ocean analogy is a powerful and memorable metaphor, which is responsible for its popularity. This metaphor can be powerful enough to stimulate people to action. The concepts behind the Blue Ocean Strategy (such as the competing factors, the consumer cycle, non-customers, etc.) are not new, however. Many of these tools are also used by Six Sigma practitioners and proposed by other management theorists. Many of the book's key concepts were previously covered in Competing For The Future by Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad, which was published in 1996. The authors encouraged managers to stake out new marketing space, which they termed white space, in order to \\"create and dominate emerging opportunities\\".

Founded in 1992 by Ted Marlow and Richard Marlow, Ultima Sports Ltd manufacture and distribute worldwide the Ultima Evolution supercar. The current Evolution is available in two body styles: coupe and convertible. The Ultima Evolution Coupe and Ultima Evolution Convertible have body styles unchanged from the preceding Ultima GTR and Ultima Can-Am models respectively. Prior to the GTR and Can-Am models, the two models produced were the Ultima Sport and Ultima Spyder. All models in the Ultima range have always been primarily supplied in component form. That is, Ultima produces the parts required for an owner/builder to construct the car off-site. This is the only way to receive such a vehicle in the USA (including a 'rolling body' fully constructed minus engine and transmission). However cars are also manufactured onsite as \\"turnkey\\" models for the European market. The first Ultima produced was the Ultima Mk1 produced in 1983 by Lee Noble of Noble Motorsports Ltd. The car was intended to go into production, but only one was produced because before any sold, the Ultima Mk2 was introduced in 1989. The Mk2 is based on the Mk1 but features new suspension and better brakes. The car was very successful on track, winning many races and taking multiple championship wins in smaller series, being driven by Lee Noble and Ted Marlow. It was featured on the covers of Kitcars and Specials magazine, Sports Car Monthly Magazine and Autochromes Magazine. 13 Ultima Mk2s were produced in total. The Ultima Mk3 introduced in 1989 featured a brand new fiberglass body but was still powered by the same PRV V6. It was the last Ultima produced by Noble Motorsports Ltd before Ted Marlow and Richard Marlow bought the rights to the car in 1992 and started Ultima Sports. The preferred engine supplier for Ultima is currently American Speed, a company which specialises in re-engineering Chevrolet V8s for increased performance. It was with a version of the Chevrolet small-block V8 built by American Speed, that company director Richard Marlow was able to set a number of performance records in an Ultima GTR during 2005, this combination was known as the Ultima GTR640. The latest Evolution variant is being marketed with an American Speed motor as the most powerful available from the factory. In 2006 Ultima beat their own 0–100 mph-0 record set in the GTR640 with the GTR720, again using an American Speed SBC engine but now with . The new record shaved 0.4 seconds off the time completing 0–100–0 mph in 9.4 seconds, a new world record for a production road car with street legal tyres and exhaust. All tests were recorded on road legal tyres in controlled conditions using a standard Ultima GTR720 and verified by an official from Datron Technology (Guinness World Records timekeepers) using Microsat GPS equipment. The Ultima GTR720 has also recorded the quickest ever road legal lap time around the Top Gear Test Track at 1 min 12.8 secs, albeit unofficially but with an independent timekeeper and GPS timing gear present. The vehicle was also driven to and from the test track on the public roads as proof of its road going ability. The same Ultima GTR720 also recorded an even quicker Top Gear Test Track lap time of 1 min 9.9 secs but this time fitted with slick racing tyres to eclipse the 1 min 10.7 secs lap time of Michael Schumacher in his $1.8 million Ferrari FXX track car. It has been suggested that with the substantial upgrades, the Ultima Evolution may go from 0–60 mph in 2.3 seconds, 0–100 mph in 4.9s, and 0–100 mph-0 in 8.8s.Jan, Melin. \\"Bilen som slår alla rekord\\" Ny Teknik, 10 April 2015.

It involves a high-speed stream of glow discharge (plasma) of an appropriate gas mixture being shot (in pulses) at a sample. The plasma source, known as etch species, can be either charged (ions) or neutral (atoms and radicals). During the process, the plasma generates volatile etch products at room temperature from the chemical reactions between the elements of the material etched and the reactive species generated by the plasma. Eventually the atoms of the shot element embed themselves at or just below the surface of the target, thus modifying the physical properties of the target. Mechanisms Plasma generation A plasma is a high energetic condition in which a lot of processes can occur. These processes happen because of electrons and atoms. To form the plasma electrons have to be accelerated to gain energy. Highly energetic electrons transfer the energy to atoms by collisions. Three different processes can occur because of this collisions: *Excitation *Dissociation *Ionization Different species are present in the plasma such as electrons, ions, radicals, and neutral particles. Those species are interacting with each other constantly. Plasma etching can be divided into two main types of interaction: *generation of chemical species *interaction with the surrounding surfaces Without a plasma, all those processes would occur at a higher temperature. There are different ways to change the plasma chemistry and get different kinds of plasma etching or plasma depositions. One of the excitation techniques to form a plasma is by using RF excitation of a power source of 13.56 MHz. The mode of operation of the plasma system will change if the operating pressure changes. Also, it is different for different structures of the reaction chamber. In the simple case, the electrode structure is symmetrical, and the sample is placed upon the grounded electrode. Influences on the process The key to develop successful complex etching processes is to find the appropriate gas etch chemistry that will form volatile products with the material to be etched as shown in Table 1. For some difficult materials (such as magnetic materials), the volatility can only be obtained when the wafer temperature is increased. The main factors that influence the plasma process: *Electron source *Pressure *Gas species *Vacuum 600x600px Surface interaction The reaction of the products depend on the likelihood of dissimilar atoms, photons, or radicals reacting to form chemical compounds. The temperature of the surface also affects the reaction of products. Adsorption happens when a substance is able to gather and reach the surface in a condensed layer, ranging in thickness (usually a thin, oxidized layer.) Volatile products desorb in the plasma phase and help the plasma etching process as the material interacts with the sample's walls. If the products are not volatile, a thin film will form at the surface of the material. Different principles that affect a sample's ability for plasma etching: *Volatility *Adsorption *Chemical Affinity *Ion-bombarding *Sputtering Plasma etching can change the surface contact angles, such as hydrophilic to hydrophobic, or vice versa. Argon plasma etching has reported to enhance contact angle from 52 deg to 68 deg, and, Oxygen plasma etching to reduce contact angle from 52 deg to 19 deg for CFRP composites for bone plate applications. Plasma etching has been reported to reduce the surface roughness from hundreds of nanometers to as much lower as 3 nm for metals. Types Pressure influences the plasma etching process. For plasma etching to happen, the chamber has to be under low pressure, less than 100 Pa. In order to generate low-pressure plasma, the gas has to be ionized. The ionization happens by a glow charge. Those excitations happen by an external source, which can deliver up to 30 kW and frequencies from 50 Hz (dc) over 5–10 Hz (pulsed dc) to radio and microwave frequency (MHz-GHz). Microwave plasma etching Microwave etching happens with an excitation sources in the microwave frequency, so between MHz and GHz. One example of plasma etching is shown here. A microwave plasma etching apparatus. The microwave operates at 2.45 GHz. This frequency is generated by a magnetron and discharges through a rectangular and a round waveguide. The discharge area is in a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 66mm. Two coils and a permanent magnet are wrapped around the quartz tube to create a magnetic field which directs the plasma. Hydrogen plasma etching One form to use gas as plasma etching is hydrogen plasma etching. Therefore, an experimental apparatus like this can be used: A quartz tube with an rf excitation of 30 MHz is shown. It is coupled with a coil around the tube with a power density of 2-10 W/cm³. The gas species is H2 gas in the chamber. The range of the gas pressure is 100-300 um. Applications Plasma etching is currently used to process semiconducting materials for their use in the fabrication of electronics. Small features can be etched into the surface of the semiconducting material in order to be more efficient or enhance certain properties when used in electronic devices. For example, plasma etching can be used to create deep trenches on the surface of silicon for uses in microelectromechanical systems. This application suggests that plasma etching also has the potential to play a major role in the production of microelectronics. Similarly, research is currently being done on how the process can be adjusted to the nanometer scale. Hydrogen plasma etching, in particular, has other interesting applications. When used in the process of etching semiconductors, hydrogen plasma etching has been shown to be effective in removing portions of native oxides found on the surface. Hydrogen plasma etching also tends to leave a clean and chemically balanced surface, which is ideal for a number of applications. Oxygen plasma etching can be used for anisotropic deep-etching of diamond nanostructures by application of high bias in inductively coupled plasma/reactive ion etching (ICP/RIE) reactor. On the other hand the use of oxygen 0V bias plasmas can be used for isotropic surface termination of C-H terminated diamond surface.

Balša, the founder, was a petty nobleman who held only one village during the rule of Emperor Dušan the Mighty (r. 1331–1355), and only after the death of the emperor, his three sons gained power in Lower Zeta after acquiring the lands of gospodin Žarko (fl. 1336–1360) under unclear circumstances, and they then expanded into Upper Zeta by murdering voivode and čelnik Đuraš Ilijić (r. 1326–1362†). Nevertheless, they were acknowledged as oblastni gospodari of Zeta in edicts of Emperor Uroš the Weak (r. 1355–1371). After the death of Uroš (1371), the family feuded with the Mrnjavčevići, who controlled Macedonia. In 1421, Balša III, on his death, passed the rule of Zeta to his uncle, Despot Stefan the Tall. History Origin The Balšić family was first mentioned in a charter of Emperor Stefan Uroš V, dated 29 September 1360. Due to sources having nothing reliable to say about their ancestors, there has been speculation on their origin, which some deem unknown.Rudić 2006, p. 99: \\"О њиховом пореклу не знамо ништа\\" ,, \\"Према Чедомиљу Мијатовићу Балшићи су пореклом били француска, односно провансалска породица. Од њих су настали италијански Балшићи, од којих потичу српски Балшићи, а од њих румунски. Ч. Мијатовић, Балшићи, генеалошка студија, 150\\"Veselinović-Ljušić 2008, p. 91: \\"Пошто нам извори ништа поуздано не говоре о њиховим прецима, порекло ове породице је загонетно. Оно што је сигурно, то је да је име њиховог родоначелника несловенског порекла, па је то био повод историчарима да претке ...\\" Apart from Mavro Orbini's tale, there are really no other accounts on their origin.Fajfric, 44. Oblasni gospodari: \\"O njihovom poreklu se zna veoma malo, tako da osim navoda koje je ostavio Mavro Orbin drugih podataka skoro i da nema. Postoje neki fragmentarni navodi koji ukazuju da je rodonačelnik ove porodice, Balša, zapravo rod od \\"cara Nemanje\\" te da je držao oblast Bojane (u susedstvu Skadra), no to je sve veoma nesigurno.\\" In oral tradition, they descended via Grand Prince Vukan Nemanjić. There exist fragmental assertions that they descended from \\"Emperor Nemanja\\". The oldest mention of a Balšić is from 1304, when Serbian Queen Helen of Anjou sent a letter in Slavic through her trustee Matija Balšić from Bar (Mata de Balsich de Antibaro) to Ragusa. A theory is that this Balšić married a female member of the Nemanjić royal family, and thus established the noble family of Balšić. There has been various opinions about the family's origin. Karl Hopf (1832–1873) considered \\"unquestionably part of the Serb tribe\\".Slijepčević 1974, p. 43: \\"Према Карлу Хопфу и Балшићи и Црнојевићи »припадају без спора српскоме племену».34) Милан Шуфлај вели: »Балшићи су румунскога и влашкога подријетла;\\" Ivan Stepanovich Yastrebov (1839–1894), Russian Consul in Shkodër and Prizren, when speaking of the Balšići, connected their name to the Roman town of Balletium (Baleč) located near modern Shkodër.Akademia e Shkencave e RPS të Shqipërisë 1985, p. 323: \\"Whereas JS Jastrebov, when speaking of the Balshaj of Shkodra calls then Balesium, Balezza, Balezum, Balezo and adds that the Greeks in Dukel74 called them Barizi.\\" According to Čedomilj Mijatović (1842–1934), the Balšić family had ultimate origin in the House of Baux from Provence (southeastern France); from that family sprung an Italian family (del Balzo), and from them the Balšići, and from them a Romanian family. Serbian historian Vladimir Ćorović (1885–1941) concluded, based on their name, that they had Roman (Vlach) origin.Ćorović 2001, ТРЕЋИ ПЕРИОД, IX. Распад Српске Царевине Croatian ethnologist Milan Šufflay (1879–1931) mentioned them as of \\"Romanian and Vlach origin\\". Croatian linguist Petar Skok considered them to have been of Vlach origin, and Serbian historian Milena Gecić supported his theory. Giuseppe Gelcich theorized on the origin in his La Zedda e la dinastia dei Balšidi: studi storici documentati (1899). The theory asserting them as descendants of the Frankish nobleman Bertrand III of Baux, a companion of Charles d'Anjou is regarded as highly improbable. German linguist Gustav Weigand (1860–1930) supported a mixed Albanian-Aromanian origin after he noted that the family name was included in a list of early Albanian surnames in Romania. In modern scholarship John Van Antwerp Fine Jr., Donald Nicol, Peter Bartl view the origin of the Balšić family as Serbian. According to Noel Malcolm, the Balsiči were a Serbo-Albanian family, while Robert Elsie mentions them as of \\"probably Slavic origin\\". Sauro Gelichi considers them Serbian-Montenegrin. Ines Angjeli Murzaku says that the family had an Albanian origin. Edgar Hösch mentions the Thopias and Balšići as native Albanian families that gained political power after 1355. Alexandru Madgearu mentions the Balšić as a noble Albanian family, however he states that their Albanian origin is unclear, due to the debate over the family's origin as either Serbian or Vlach. Wayne E. Lee, Matthew Lubin, Eduard Ndreca, Michael L. Galaty, Mentor Mustafa and Robert Schon mention the families of Balsha (Balšić), along with Dukagjin, Topia and Kastrati, as local Albanian lords which held fragmented power in north of Albania. According to Sarajevo University historian Mehmed Hodžić, who studied the works of Konstantin Jireček, Vladimir Jovojovic, and Dragoje Zivkovic, the Balšićs originated from Shkodër and from Slavized Vlachs and that they rose to military nobility on military merit. Early history According to Mavro Orbini (writing in 1601), Balša, the eponymous founder, was a petty nobleman that held only one village in the area of Lake Skadar during the rule of Emperor Dušan the Mighty (r. 1331-1355). Only after the death of the emperor, Balša and his three sons gained power in Lower Zeta after acquiring the lands of gospodin Žarko (fl. 1336-1360) and by murdering voivode and čelnik Đuraš Ilijić (r. 1326-1362†), the holders of Lower and Upper Zeta, respectively.Fajfrić, ch. 44, Oblasni gospodari: \\"Balša o kojem ćemo sada govoriti beše veoma siromašan zetski vlastelin i za života cara Stefana držao je samo jedno selo. Ali kad je umro car, a kako njegov sin Uroš nije bio valjan vladar, počeo je s nekoliko svojih prijatelja i sa svojim sinovima Stracimirom, Đurđem i Balšom da zauzima Donju Zetu.\\" \\"Posle toga krenuo je sa svojim ljudima na osvajanje Gornje Zete, koju je držao Đuraš Ilijić i njegovi rođaci.

Marshall, 547 U.S. 293 (2006), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a federal district court had equal or concurrent jurisdiction with state probate (will) courts over tort claims under state common law. The case drew an unusual amount of interest because the petitioner was Playboy Playmate and celebrity Anna Nicole Smith (whose legal name was Vickie Lynn Marshall). Smith won the case, but unsolved issues regarding her inheritance eventually led to another Supreme Court case, Stern v. Marshall. She died long before that case was decided.  Background  Twelve years prior to his marriage to Smith, J. Howard Marshall II had set up a trust which owned all of his assets and would pass them to various charities and his son E. Pierce Marshall after his death. Smith had claimed that it was J. Howard's intention after marriage to set up a separate trust for her benefit, which would essentially leave her half the appreciation of the assets of the trust during the period of the marriage, but that his son Pierce had interfered with the formation of this separate trust. J. Howard Marshall neither set up a trust in Smith's favor, nor changed the terms of his will to provide for her after his death. However, he did make his existing trust irrevocable soon after his marriage to Smith. As a result, Smith was excluded from J. Howard's estate. She sued in Texas Probate Court for a share of the estate on several grounds, and her litigation was actively opposed by Marshall's son Pierce. The primary ground for the son's opposition was that his father had an extensive estate plan executed over many decades which expressed his clear wishes. Pierce also believed his father had already been quite generous to Smith during the marriage, providing Smith with both expensive gifts and monetary resources. After receiving a default judgment against her for sexual harassment, Smith petitioned for bankruptcy in California. Pierce filed a non-dischargeability claim and proof of claim against Smith based on public statements her lawyers made to the media shortly after her husband died, accusing Pierce of frustrating J. Howard's intentions to set up a new trust for Smith and isolating his father. Pierce alleged these statements were libelous, and he successfully sued Smith's attorneys on the same grounds in Texas State Court. Smith opposed the claims and countersued Pierce on the basis her statements were true and on tort claims she was already pursuing in Texas. The Bankruptcy Court dismissed the libel claim on summary judgment and did not allow the claim to proceed to trial. After being released from bankruptcy, Smith pursued her counterclaim against Pierce, alleging he interfered with his father's intention to set up a trust in favor of Smith. During the Texas Probate proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court awarded Smith $474 million on the basis of a sanction against Pierce, and deemed his interference to have occurred. The Federal District court subsequently vacated the Bankruptcy award and reduced Smith's award to $88 million. However, after a five-month jury trial in Texas, the Probate Court entered a decision that J. Howard Marshall's will and trust were valid, and that his son was the primary beneficiary—rejecting Smith's claim that the son had exerted undue influence on his father, or interfered with any trust for Smith. When the matter came before the 9th Circuit appellate court, it rendered the District Court's decision invalid on jurisdictional grounds, declaring that only Texas Probate Courts had jurisdiction over probate matters. The case was also important since the Supreme Court last reviewed the probate exception in Markham v. Allen,. and its analogue, the domestic relations exception, in Ankenbrandt v. Richards.. The Bush administration, which wanted to limit exceptions to federal jurisdiction in state probate related matters, instructed the United States Solicitor General to submit a brief on the side of the petitioner.  Questions presented  # What is the scope of the probate exception to federal jurisdiction? #Did Congress intend the probate exception to apply where a federal court is not asked to probate a will, administer an estate, or otherwise assume control of property in the custody of a state probate court? #Did Congress intend the probate exception to apply to cases arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States (28 U.S.C. § 1331), including the Bankruptcy Code (28 U.S.C. § 1334), or is it limited to cases in which jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship? #Did Congress intend the probate exception to apply to cases arising out of trusts, or is it limited to cases involving wills?  Opinion of the Court  On February 28, 2006, the case was argued. May 1, 2006, the United States Supreme Court unanimously decided the case in favor of Anna Nicole Smith on the question of federal jurisdiction.. The Court held that federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain suits to determine the rights of creditors, legatees, heirs, and other claimants relating to an estate, so long as the federal court does not probate a will, administer an estate, take control of assets being administered by the probate court or interfere with the probate proceedings.

Billy Butler was born in Atherton, Lancashire. He had never played for any form of organised football team prior to joining the army. He played as a centre-forward for his regiment and on leaving the army he joined his hometown club Atherton at the age of 19. He moved to Bolton Wanderers in April 1920 and, on moving to the right wing, soon established himself. He played in the 1923 FA Cup Final victory over West Ham United, the famous first Wembley final, and the following year, on 12 April 1924, made his England debut against Scotland. It was to be his only appearance for the England national team, but he was back at Wembley again for the 1926 FA Cup Final win over Manchester City, and picked up his third winners medal in 1929, scoring the opening goal in the 2–0 defeat of Portsmouth. On Bolton's relegation in 1933, Butler asked for a transfer and left to join his former Bolton teammate Joe Smith, who by now was manager of Reading. He had played 449 games for Bolton, scoring 74 goals. In August 1935, Smith left to manage Blackpool and Butler took over the reins at Reading and carried on with the good work Smith had started. Reading never finished below 6th place in Division Three (South) during Butler's tenure and were heading for another top five finish when he resigned in February 1939. He became manager of Guildford City, but then World War II intervened and Butler joined the RAF as a PT instructor. With the war over, Butler was appointed manager of Torquay United in August 1945, but left Plainmoor in May 1946 before league football had resumed. He subsequently moved to South Africa to manage Johannesburg Rangers, where he discovered the future Wolves defender Eddie Stuart and future Blackpool and England left winger Bill Perry. He was later a coach for the Pietermaritzburg & District Football Association and then a coach for the Rhodesian Football Association Butler died in Durban in July 1966, aged 66.

DeBartolo Corporation, as the largest mall in the Southeastern United States. The founding anchors included JCPenney, which moved from its historic store downtown on Clematis Street about three miles (5 km) southeast, Jordan Marsh and Richards. By the end of the decade, the mall also featured Walgreens, Lerner Shops, Food Fair, Woolworth, and The Mall Cinema 1-2-3-4 quadraplex. The Palm Beach Mall was expanded and renovated in 1980, in conjunction with the addition of Burdines (which relocated from its Downtown West Palm Beach location) sporting a parking garage and Lord & Taylor. Also in 1980 Sears moved into the space previously occupied by Richards, which had closed the same year following a statewide liquidation. The shopping mall's terrazzo floor was replaced with tiles at this time. The former mall's main entrance Furthermore, when Pantry Pride (formerly Food Fair) closed in 1987, a food court called Treats was developed from its space.

Its progenitor Đuraš Ilijić, was the head of Upper Zeta in the Medieval Kingdom of Serbia and Empire (r. 1326–1362†), under Stefan Dečanski, Dušan the Mighty and Stefan Uroš V. Đuraš was killed in 1362 by the Balšić family, the holders of Lower Zeta (since 1360); Zeta was in the hands of the Balšići under nominal Imperial rule until 1421, when Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarević was given the province by Balša III (1403–1421). The family fought its rivals following the murder of Đuraš, and the Crnojevićs controlled Budva from 1392 until 1396, when Radič Crnojević was murdered by the Balšićs. They are mentioned again in 1403, as vassals of the Republic of Venice, taking power in their hereditary lands. History Origins The oldest known ancestor is Head Ilija. The family has been referred to as Đurašević (Montenegrin and , Đuraševići / Ђурашевићи), from Đuraš Ilijić, the son of Ilija, who was Head of Upper Zeta from 1326 until his death in 1362, when he was killed by the Balšić family. Although Đuraš Ilijić was an important figure in the Medieval Kingdom of Serbia, it was his grandson Đuraš Ilijić who became advisor of the Serbian King Stefan of Dečani in 1326. Five years later, Đuraš supported Prince Dušan Nemanjić in overthrowing the King. In 1355, the Croatian duchess and sister of Emperor Dušan, Jelena Nemanjić Šubić, had come greatly under pressure by the Hungarian King who attacked one of her cities in Croatia, (Skradin). Emperor Dušan dispatched Đuraš Ilijić to relieve the siège. He left with an army and his two brothers, Nikola and Vladin, as well as his sons and nephews. Đuraš successfully kept the city up to January 10, 1356, when Emperor Uroš, Dušan's successor, ordered him to deliver it to the Venetians. Đuraš was liquidated by Balša I's sons as a rival in 1362. He was buried in the Church of Saint Michael on Prevlaka with the inscription \\"in Emperor's Stefan's name a fearsome knight\\" (Montenegrin and ). After this, the Đuraševići were greatly suppressed by the Balšići. They ruled in the areas of Budva and the Gulf of Kotor. At times, they cooperated with the Balšić, but most frequently fought them for control. Crnojević Coat of arms of the Crnojevići, according to the Illyrian Armorials. Flag of the Crnojevići. Radič, the successor of Crnoje, emerged, together with his brothers Stefan and Dobrivoje, as the masters of Budva, at the end of the 14th century. He maintained close relations with the Republic of Dubrovnik, where he was an honorary citizen. At the same time, the relations with City of Kotor were bad. He frequently jeopardized Kotor and expanded his domain to include Grbalj and Paštrovići. As the Serbian Empire crumbled, the House of Crnoje became virtually independent in Upper Zeta (region around modern Cetinje. Radič was killed in combat in a war against the House of Balšić in 1396. After the death of Radič, the Crnojevići, under the brothers Dobrivoj and Stefan, suffered a major decline. There were territorial losses to the Đuraševići, led by the brothers Đurađ and Aleksa (also called Lješ), both sons of the late Radič. They were first referred to in sources in 1403. They seemed to have been actively supporting Đurađ II's campaign against the Crnojevići in the late 1390s. They also played a major role in Sandalj Hranić's expulsion from Zeta through a campaign led by Đurađ. As a reward, Đurađ gave them Budva, as well as Saint Michael's Metohija (Grbalj). The Đuraševići used this period of support of the Balšićs to gain much of the Crnojević possessions in the mountains behind Kotor. Đuraš and Aleksa sided with Venetians and as their vassals ruled the area of Upper Zeta in 1403–1435. The most important role in establishing the family's rule in Zeta had Stefan I called \\"Stefanica\\" (1451–1465). He used the turmoil in Zeta and managed to become de facto ruler of the region. He secured a leading position in his family and married Maria, Skenderbeg's sister. After the fall of the southern part of Serbia under the Turks in 1455, Stefan acknowledged Venetian rule in return for autonomy on internal affairs and autonomy for the Orthodox Metropolitan. His son Ivan (1465–1490), better known as Ivan-beg, started his rule with a war on the Venetians, but had to repent later in face of Turkish threat. He was forced to become a Turkish vassal in addition to being a Venetian one already. He was forced by Turks to flee to Italy in 1479 and managed to return only in 1481, again as the Turkish vassal. He moved the seat of Zeta Metropolitan from Prevlaka to the more secure Cetinje in 1485 and soon it became his capital. Ivan's son Đurađ (1490–1496) remained consistent to his father's policies, although he married a daughter of a Venetian noble. He fostered the printing house of Cetinje monastery in which the first book in Serbian was printed in 1494. When his contacts with the King of France on starting an anti-Ottoman war became known to the Turks, he had to flee Montenegro, which fell under direct Turkish rule. He was an educated man known for his knowledge on many topics. He was succeeded by his brother Stefan II (1496–1498) who led the administration of Montenegro for the Ottoman Empire. Ivan's third son Staniša, now islamized and renamed as Skender-beg, ruled his ancestral lands from 1513 to 1530 and was an obedient servant to the Sultan. The descendants of Đurađ lived in Hungary and Venice where they died out in the mid-17th century.

An attenuator is effectively the opposite of an amplifier, though the two work by different methods. While an amplifier provides gain, an attenuator provides loss, or gain less than 1. Construction and usage Attenuators are usually passive devices made from simple voltage divider networks. Switching between different resistances forms adjustable stepped attenuators and continuously adjustable ones using potentiometers. For higher frequencies precisely matched low VSWR resistance networks are used. Fixed attenuators in circuits are used to lower voltage, dissipate power, and to improve impedance matching. In measuring signals, attenuator pads or adapters are used to lower the amplitude of the signal a known amount to enable measurements, or to protect the measuring device from signal levels that might damage it. Attenuators are also used to 'match' impedance by lowering apparent SWR (Standing Wave Ratio). Attenuator circuits π-type unbalanced attenuator circuit π-type balanced attenuator circuit T-type unbalanced attenuator circuit T-type balanced attenuator circuit Basic circuits used in attenuators are pi pads (π-type) and T pads. These may be required to be balanced or unbalanced networks depending on whether the line geometry with which they are to be used is balanced or unbalanced. For instance, attenuators used with coaxial lines would be the unbalanced form while attenuators for use with twisted pair are required to be the balanced form. Four fundamental attenuator circuit diagrams are given in the figures on the left. Since an attenuator circuit consists solely of passive resistor elements, it is both linear and reciprocal. If the circuit is also made symmetrical (this is usually the case since it is usually required that the input and output impedance Z1 and Z2 are equal), then the input and output ports are not distinguished, but by convention the left and right sides of the circuits are referred to as input and output, respectively. Various tables and calculators are available that provide a means of determining the appropriate resistor values for achieving particular loss values. One of the earliest was published by the NAB in 1960 for losses ranging from 1/2 to 40 dB, for use in 600 ohm circuits. Attenuator characteristics An RF microwave attenuator Key specifications for attenuators are: * Attenuation expressed in decibels of relative power. A 3 dB pad reduces power to one half, 6 dB to one fourth, 10 dB to one tenth, 20 dB to one hundredth, 30 dB to one thousandth and so on. For voltage, you double the dBs so for example 6 dB is half in voltage. * Nominal impedance, for example 50 ohm * Frequency bandwidth, for example DC-18 GHz * Power dissipation depends on mass and surface area of resistance material as well as possible additional cooling fins. * SWR is the standing wave ratio for input and output ports * Accuracy * Repeatability RF attenuators Radio frequency attenuators are typically coaxial in structure with precision connectors as ports and coaxial, micro strip or thin-film internal structure. Above SHF special waveguide structure is required. Important characteristics are: *accuracy, *low SWR, *flat frequency-response and *repeatability. The size and shape of the attenuator depends on its ability to dissipate power. RF attenuators are used as loads for and as known attenuation and protective dissipation of power in measuring RF signals.About RF attenuators – Herley General Microwave Audio attenuators A line-level attenuator in the preamp or a power attenuator after the power amplifier uses electrical resistance to reduce the amplitude of the signal that reaches the speaker, reducing the volume of the output. A line-level attenuator has lower power handling, such as a 1/2-watt potentiometer or voltage divider and controls preamp level signals, whereas a power attenuator has higher power handling capability, such as 10 watts or more, and is used between the power amplifier and the speaker. *Power attenuator (guitar) *Guitar amplifier Component values for resistive pads and attenuators This section concerns pi-pads, T-pads and L-pads made entirely from resistors and terminated on each port with a purely real resistance. *All impedance, currents, voltages and two-port parameters will be assumed to be purely real. For practical applications, this assumption is often close enough. * The pad is designed for a particular load impedance, ZLoad, and a particular source impedance, Zs. **The impedance seen looking into the input port will be ZS if the output port is terminated by ZLoad. **The impedance seen looking into the output port will be ZLoad if the input port is terminated by ZS. Reference figures for attenuator component calculation thumb400px This circuit is used for the general case, all T-pads, all pi-pads and L-pads when the source impedance is greater than or equal to the load impedance. thumb400px The L-pad computation assumes that port 1 has the highest impedance. If the highest impedance happens to be the output port, then use this figure. Unique resistor designations for Tee, Pi and L pads. The attenuator two-port is generally bidirectional. However, in this section it will be treated as though it were one way. In general, either of the two figures applies, but the first figure (which depicts the source on the left) will be tacitly assumed most of the time. In the case of the L-pad, the second figure will be used if the load impedance is greater than the source impedance. Each resistor in each type of pad discussed is given a unique designation to decrease confusion. The L-pad component value calculation assumes that the design impedance for port 1 (on the left) is equal or higher than the design impedance for port 2. Terms used * Pad will include pi-pad, T-pad, L-pad, attenuator, and two-port. * Two-port will include pi-pad, T-pad, L-pad, attenuator, and two-port. * Input port will mean the input port of the two-port. * Output port will mean the output port of the two-port. * Symmetric means a case where the source and load have equal impedance. * Loss means the ratio of power entering the input port of the pad divided by the power absorbed by the load. * Insertion Loss means the ratio of power that would be delivered to the load if the load were directly connected to the source divided by the power absorbed by the load when connected through the pad. Symbols used Passive, resistive pads and attenuators are bidirectional two-ports, but in this section they will be treated as unidirectional. *ZS = the output impedance of the source. *ZLoad = the input impedance of the load. *Zin = the impedance seen looking into the input port when ZLoad is connected to the output port. Zin is a function of the load impedance. *Zout = the impedance seen looking into the output port when Zs is connected to the input port. Zout is a function of the source impedance. *Vs = source open circuit or unloaded voltage. *Vin = voltage applied to the input port by the source. *Vout = voltage applied to the load by the output port. *Iin = current entering the input port from the source. *Iout = current entering the load from the output port. *Pin = Vin Iin = power entering the input port from the source. *Pout = Vout Iout = power absorbed by the load from the output port. *Pdirect = the power that would be absorbed by the load if the load were connected directly to the source. *Lpad = 10 log10 (Pin / Pout ) always. And if Zs = ZLoad then Lpad = 20 log10 (Vin / Vout ) also. Note, as defined, Loss ≥ 0 dB *Linsertion = 10 log10 (Pdirect / Pout ). And if Zs = ZLoad then Linsertion = Lpad. *Loss ≡ Lpad. Loss is defined to be Lpad.

Introduced on 12 March 1992 by producer Leonard Lewis, Mandy was portrayed as a teenage tearaway. She was featured in storylines about teenage homelessness, child abuse and recreational drug taking. Her relationship with Aidan Brosnan (Sean Maguire) was one of the prominent storylines featured in 1993. Due to the character's antagonistic behaviour, it has been suggested that Mandy was one of the most hated characters on television during her tenure. The character appeared in a special episode of Doctor Who in 1993, which was set in the fictional soap setting of Walford. Stapleton quit the role and Mandy departed on-screen on 13 January 1994. Following Mandy's initial exit, Stapleton claimed that she was asked to reprise the role on several occasions; she turned these offers down until producer Bryan Kirkwood negotiated her comeback in 2011. After a 17-year hiatus, Mandy reappeared from 29 August 2011 and began a relationship with the long-running character, Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). Mandy's return storylines focused on her dysfunctional relationship with her abusive mother Lorraine (Victoria Alcock), her unconventional engagement to Ian, and her fuelling conflict with Ian's daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater). On 4 April 2012, it was announced that Stapleton would be leaving EastEnders for a second time. Mandy and Ian were not given a happy ending; their relationship dissolved and Mandy departed in the episode broadcast on 31 May 2012. Storylines 1992–1994 Mandy arrives in Albert Square in March 1992 when her hospitalised mother, Lorraine (Linda Henry), leaves her in Pat Butcher's (Pam St. Clement) care. She makes friends with Sam Butcher (Danniella Westbrook) but eventually leaves the Butchers as she feels unwanted by Pat's husband, Frank (Mike Reid). She then begins squatting. Mandy is a troublesome teenager. She blackmails Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), threatening to divulge that he visits prostitutes unless he employs her. Ian does not succumb, so Mandy survives by stealing, conning people and relying on charity. After Mandy is evicted from her squat, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) allows her to live with her, but Mandy is eventually thrown out when she is caught spreading rumours that Kathy has been abusing her. Mandy ends 1992 homeless and sleeping in a makeshift shanty. Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) and Steve Elliot (Mark Monero) eventually let Mandy stay with them, but Mandy's stirring contributes to the demise of Steve's relationship with Hattie Tavernier (Michelle Gayle); Mandy and Hattie maintain an antagonistic relationship throughout their time together in Walford. On Christmas Eve 1992, Mandy receives a Christmas card from her mother, telling her she is visiting. However, Lorraine never arrives, so on Christmas Day, Mandy returns to Lorraine's flat but finds her mother's boyfriend, Gary (Thomas Craig), instead. He is abusive to Mandy and starts beating her, until she is rescued by Mark. Mandy meets trainee footballer, Aidan Brosnan (Sean Maguire) in 1993. They begin dating, but Mandy is a bad influence on Aidan and encourages him to skip football practice, get drunk and use ecstasy. This results in an intoxicated Aidan falling and damaging his knee, and following a subsequent injury, Aidan is told that his career in professional football is over. The loss of his dream hits Aidan badly, but by now Mandy has fallen for him in a big way, and when he returns to Ireland, she follows him. Both soon return, having had a poor reception from Aidan's family. The young lovers are unable to find work so they begin sleeping on the streets and squatting. To get money, Mandy and Aidan beg and occasionally do odd jobs. It is on one such occasion that Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) leaves his wife Sharon Mitchell's (Letitia Dean) pet poodle, Roly, in Mandy's care. However, Mandy loses control of Roly and he dies after running straight into an oncoming truck, devastating Sharon. Mandy later cleans Dr Legg's (Leonard Fenton) GP surgery, but after stealing prescription slips and selling them to drug dealers, she is sacked. She then turns to 'clipping', acting as a prostitute then running off with the customer's money without performing the sexual service. However, the other prostitutes in Kings Cross beat Mandy and after she is arrested, Aidan makes her promise to stop. When Richard Cole (Ian Reddington) starts a smear campaign against them, accusing them of being behind a series of robberies around the Square, everyone turns on them. Aidan becomes depressed and on Christmas Day 1993 he attempts to commit suicide by threatening to jump off the top of a tower block. Mandy manages to stop him but Aidan realises that Mandy is bad for him, and he returns to his family in Ireland. Mandy is distraught at losing Aidan. Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) takes sympathy and allows her to stay with her; Mandy sees New Year 1994 in, huddled and sobbing on the Fowlers' couch. Early in 1994, Mandy turns to Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) for comfort and they have a one-night stand. However, this only makes Mandy realise how much she misses Aidan, and she rejects Ricky's further advances. All alone, Mandy leaves Albert Square in January 1994, repaying the Fowlers' kindness by stealing Pauline's purse and hitching a ride with a lorry driver, who is heading west on the M11. 2011–2012 Mandy is not seen again for 17 years until Ian stumbles across her being thrown out of a strip club by a man Mandy claims is her abusive ex-boyfriend; however, it transpires the man is her employer at the strip club from whom Mandy has stolen £5,000. Ian allows her to stay with him in Walford and a friendship develops as Mandy bonds with Ian's son Bobby (Alex Francis) and helps Ian discover his frivolous side. Ian develops romantic feelings for Mandy and she accepts his impromptu marriage proposal. However, when Mandy meets her old friend Ricky, they reminisce, take drugs and have sex. This causes Mandy to rethink marriage to Ian; she decides not to attend the wedding ceremony but Ian pleads with her to change her mind and the wedding is rearranged. In January 2012, Ian discovers Ricky and Mandy's tryst; the revelation ends Ricky's marriage to Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer). Mandy confesses to Ian that she became pregnant with Ricky's child in January 1994 and gave birth to a premature daughter, Kira, who died. She suggests she had sex with Ricky because of unresolved feelings for her dead daughter. Ian forgives Mandy but further problems arise when Ian's daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater) returns to Walford and takes a dislike to Mandy. Lucy attempts to turn Ian against Mandy by setting her up, poisoning Bobby's mind against her and sabotaging Mandy's wedding plans. When Lucy discovers Mandy texting someone called \\"L Stevens\\", she suspects Mandy is having an affair and arranges for \\"L\\" to visit, not realising \\"L\\" stands for Lorraine, Mandy's estranged, alcoholic mother (now played by Victoria Alcock). Seeing an opportunity to make use of Ian's resources, Lorraine convinces him that she wants to bond with Mandy, but when he is absent she verbally and physically abuses Mandy. Lorraine's true nature is eventually revealed and Ian sends her away, but her stirring nearly causes Mandy and Ian's relationship to end. When a sickly Lorraine returns to Walford, Ian forbids Mandy from caring for her. Secretly, Mandy visits Lorraine in hospital and they briefly bond, but Lorraine turns nasty again when Mandy disobeys her, telling her that she has never loved or wanted her. A few weeks later, Mandy is devastated to learn that Lorraine has died. Ian, who is going through financial difficulties and is behaving erratically, refuses to let Mandy grieve and goes ahead with his plans to bring their wedding forward. On their wedding day, Mandy is perturbed by Ian's increasingly strange behaviour and refuses to marry him, revealing that she has been forcing herself to love him. Ian begs her to stay but Mandy leaves as a devastated Ian shouts her name. Ian suffers a breakdown and absconds shortly after without telling his family where he is going. When Lucy discovers Ian's credit card being used in a Rochester hotel a week later, she and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) go in search of him. They find Mandy, who has been using Ian's credit card to pay for her mother's funeral. Mandy denies knowing where Ian is. She vows to make a success of her life, stating it is \\"time to grow up\\". Creation and development Introduction (1992) Mandy as she appeared in 1992. Mandy was one of several introductions to the cast of EastEnders in 1992. Executive producer Leonard Lewis took a tentative approach to introducing new characters in 1992. Most were introduced gradually, making an initial appearance and then joining the programme full-time a couple of months later. This allowed the producers and writers to create new characters and see them brought to life by the actors before committing them to a longer contract. Mandy first appeared in March 1992 as a school girl aged 15, abandoned by her mother in Pat Butcher's care. She left the series temporarily a few weeks later; in the storyline she went back to her mother's flat, but she returned by the summer of 1992 as a regular character, squatting in the soap's setting of Albert Square. Mandy was portrayed as a troublesome teenager, with an underpinning storyline of child abuse and abandonment. Nicola Stapleton, 17 at the time, was cast in the role.\\"Stapleton; Bad Girls Star Puckers up for EastEnder\\", Sunday Mail; Glasgow. URL last accessed on 22 February 2007. During her initial stint in the soap, the character was featured in storylines about child and drug abuse, homelessness, blackmail, theft and prostitution (in the form of clipping). Characterisation In his 2005 book, Eastenders: 20 Years in Albert Square, author Rupert Smith classified Mandy as a \\"lost girl\\". He described her as \\"poisonous [...] the daughter of a dodgy old lush that Pat had picked up in a hostess bar, and she arrived in Walford to work out some grudge she held against the entire world.\\" He added that \\"she lied, cheated and stole\\", suggesting that \\"there have been very few characters as entirely loathesome as Mandy Salter [...] The serpent in an East End eden.\\" Author of EastEnders: Who's who?, Kate Lock, suggested that, \\"You wanted to feel sorry for homeless waif Mandy but her deviousness made it hard to even like her.\\" She has been described as a \\"manipulative force of nature\\" with a \\"spiteful streak\\". In 2011, the executive producer of EastEnders, Bryan Kirkwood, described Mandy as outrageous, uncompromising and pragmatic. He added, \\"although she's the result of a life on the streets, she's a survivor and isn't down on her luck. Mandy knows what to do to get by\\". Discussing Mandy in 2011, Stapleton said that Mandy only relies on herself and is \\"the sort of person who uses what she's got to get by.\\" She described Mandy as minxy and incredibly flirty; someone who dresses skimpily and uses her body to get what she wants. Homelessness and relationship with Aidan Brosnan A lone character without family in the serial, Mandy was essentially homeless, and when she was unable to squat or rely on the kindness of strangers, she slept rough on the streets. This storyline came at a time when homelessness in London was a topical subject in the British media, partly due to the continued concern regarding Cardboard City, an area near Waterloo station that attracted a high proportion of homeless people who slept in cardboard boxes. Because of her involvement in this story arc, actress Nicola Stapleton became so affected by the plight of young homeless people that she joined the charity 'Countrywide', who raise money for the homeless. In January 1993 she told Inside Soap, \\"I have always thought the homeless situation was terrible, but through my research into playing Mandy, I have realised just how many young people it affects. I think it is really tragic that we have teenagers in this country sleeping out on the streets. And it isn't a problem that will go away. I just hope that by drawing attention to the problem in EastEnders more people will be willing to help [...] It is important that people realise that anyone can end up homeless. If you lose your flat or your job, you can end up in a downward spiral that will dump you on the streets. We can't shut our minds to this situation, because it could happen to any of us. I know how fortunate I am, and therefore I know that I am in a position to help, which is why I have got involved with the [charity].\\" With regard to Mandy, Stapleton believed that, in 1993, she was her \\"own worst enemy\\" and that some of her misfortune was associated to her upsetting other characters: \\"Mandy is constantly rubbing people up the wrong way, and upsetting them. Of course she has had a hard life, but she doesn't do herself any favours either. I would like to see her get a break and a chance to finally make something of herself.\\" In 1993, the character was paired romantically on-screen with Aidan Brosnan, played by Sean Maguire. Aidan and Mandy's romance was dubbed by EastEnders' scriptwriter Colin Brake as one of 1993's \\"major storylines\\", which ran throughout the year. Depicted as shy, naïve and impressionable, Aidan was quickly led astray by Mandy. In the storyline, Mandy introduced Aidan to alcohol and drugs and a swift decline for the couple culminated in them becoming homeless and sleeping on the streets or in abandoned squats. Aidan slipped into a depression, culminating in a suicide attempt, when in the Christmas Day 1993 episodes, he decided to jump off the top of a tower block. The producers' original plan had been for Aidan to succeed in his suicide bid; however, in the book EastEnders: The First Ten Years, author Colin Brake has revealed that \\"the powers-that-be\\" at the BBC intervened in the storyline. They felt that a suicide on Christmas Day would be \\"too depressing even for EastEnders\\", so they ordered for the scripts to be revised. In the revised version, Mandy arrived just in time to stop Aidan jumping to his death, her love for him convincing him not to end his life. 23 million viewers tuned in on Christmas Day 1993 to witness Aidan's suicide attempt; it was the highest rated television programme of the day, trumping its biggest rival Coronation Street by 3 million viewers. Mandy (left) and Aidan were the focus of a storyline on teenage homelessness. Here the characters are depicted squatting in a maintenance room, on the roof of a block of flats (1993). Departure (1994) The homelessness storyline spelt the end of the couple in the soap, Sean Maguire having chosen to leave to pursue other projects. During the episode that aired on 28 December 1993, Aidan — resenting Mandy for her role in his misfortune — left to return to Ireland alone. Heartbroken, Mandy fled several weeks later, in January 1994. In reality, Stapleton had grown tired of all the attention she received from being in such a high-profile show, and despite being offered a contract to continue, she quit the role. She has discussed a disagreement she had with the scriptwriters regarding a controversial scene involving Mandy, recalling, \\"Mandy had been technically raped and her line was, 'Oh, rats.' I was up to the producer's office in five minutes. I couldn't believe it. It was stronger not to say anything than a line like that.\\" In an interview in 2005 Stapleton commented: \\"Working on EastEnders was so high-profile it put me off working on soaps for a while[...] I've been asked a number of times to go back but I've done a lot of really credible stuff in theatre, and I thought, 'It took me a long time get here. I'm not ready to go back to Mandy just yet' [...] The publicity with something regarding EastEnders is huge and sometimes you end up feeling like a famous person rather than an actress — I wanted my work to be more fulfilling than that.\\" In a 2009 interview with Walford Gazette, Stapleton said, \\"[EastEnders] always left the door open for Mandy to return. [But] at the moment I'm quite happy to be doing what I'm doing.\\" She told the Daily Record that same year, \\"It doesn't bother me that I'm still recognised as Mandy from EastEnders. It means I made an impression with the character. I would never say never to going back. I don't think the show is as fabulous as it was 10 years ago but it's still pretty fantastic and you have to go where the work is.\\" Return (2011) On 9 June 2011, it was confirmed that Stapleton would reprise her role as Mandy after 17 years, in autumn 2011. Stapleton revealed that she was approached about returning by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood in February 2010, after she was invited to watch the live episode of EastEnders that was transmitted for its 25th anniversary. Stapleton said, \\"It had been discussed before but as soon as Bryan Kirkwood started telling me all these storylines he wanted to do with Mandy, I was buzzing.\\" Kirkwood, the producer overseeing Mandy's return, stated, \\"I love Nicola Stapleton, having worked with her elsewhere, and Mandy is going to be like a breath of fresh air when she arrives back\\". It was reported that Mandy had grown up slightly, but that she was still fun, chaotic and wild and she was tipped to cause trouble for at least one of Walford's well-known residents. Stapleton said of her return \\"I'm looking forward to playing Mandy again—it will be interesting to see what she's been up to all this time. I'm excited to be coming back and working with some old friends.\\" Stapleton had always envisaged that Mandy would return to EastEnders at some stage; however, as time passed she began to doubt Mandy would return, so she was \\"thrilled\\" that she and the producers were able to make it happen. Her return aired on 29 August 2011. Stapleton revealed that she deliberately did not watch EastEnders prior to her return as she did not want to know what any of the characters were involved in; she wanted to have the same inquisitiveness that Mandy would have when she returned to filming. However, she did re-watch old episodes from the 1990s featuring Mandy to get back into character. In January 2012, Stapleton revealed that she had enjoyed her second stint on EastEnders more than her initial stint. Relationship with Ian Beale Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt, pictured) was at the centre of Mandy's return storyline. In her return storyline, Mandy is found working as a lap dancer by Ian Beale, who offers her a place to stay back in Walford. Discussing her character's return storyline and involvement with Ian Beale, Stapleton said, \\"Mandy has got her eye on every man in the Square — but with Ian it's just a friendship. She lifts his spirits and has a big effect on his life.\\" She added, \\"I think [Mandy] is the most exciting thing that has happened to Ian in a long time. There's banter between them and she has a real energy that lifts his spirits. They have fun and Ian agrees to put her up [...] When we meet [Mandy] she's very much on her own living hand-to-mouth. I think there's a part of her that wants to be maternal as she gets on really well with [Ian's son] Bobby, who becomes her little mate.\\" Stapleton suggested that Mandy and Ian's friendship involves bantering with one another and having fun, Mandy being a female presence in Ian's life following his separation from his wife Jane (Laurie Brett). Stapleton added, \\"people can affect other people's lives in different ways. Mandy is a full-on person, and I think that energy either rubs off on someone or aggravates them. It's quite interesting, because it kind of does both with Ian!\\". Despite initially suggesting that Ian and Mandy's relationship was platonic, the storyline evolved, Ian confessing his feelings for Mandy after witnessing her flirting with other men. Through plot dialogue, the characters reveal their mutual desire to be loved, leading Ian to propose spontaneously to Mandy. Stapleton suggested that Mandy made Ian more frivolous. According to Stapleton, both were using each other: Mandy's motive being to gain security, and Ian's motive being to possess an attractive female. Although Stapleton suggested that the common discourse was that Mandy was using Ian for his money, she protested that there was a common connection between them. Viewers were left guessing as to whether Mandy would go through with the wedding following a tryst with her former lover, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). In the end, Mandy was unable to go through with the wedding, but she remained engaged to Ian despite his discovery in the New Year's Day 2012 episode, that Mandy and Ricky had sex. Delving into events that occurred in Mandy's history during the years she was off-screen, it is revealed that Mandy fell pregnant with Ricky's baby when she departed in 1994, but the baby died shortly after being born. Discussing Mandy's revelation, Stapleton said, \\"Being close to Ricky was more about being close to the daughter she lost\\". She suggested that deep down, Mandy was looking for a family of her own and wants to be part of the Beale family. Stapleton suggested that although Mandy's relationship with Ian was not portrayed as an immediate and big love affair, she believed the relationship could develop into love or fondness over time. Addressing the perceived differences between Ian and Mandy, Stapleton suggested that it gave them much \\"juicy\\" storyline material to work with. Stapleton also suggested that although she thought it would be nice for Mandy and Ian to have a happy ending, she was unsure that they would ever get married as she did not deem it necessary for them and felt it would change their relationship. Acrimonious relationships Mandy and Ian's storyline progressed with the reintroduction of Ian's daughter Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) in January 2012 who, taking a dislike to Mandy, tries to set her up. Stapleton revealed, \\"[Mandy's] desperate to win Lucy over but gets it all wrong [...] because she doesn't want Lucy to see her as the wicked stepmother she behaves like an older sister. Mandy gets drunk and Lucy gets her to buy some drugs. She does it because she thinks it's going to win her points with Lucy. Mandy passes out and wakes up to find the pills are gone. It's only later she discovers Lucy's planned it so [Ian's young son] Bobby finds the drugs.\\" However, according to Stapleton, Mandy is capable of outwitting Lucy. Lucy's vendetta against Mandy leads to the reintroduction of Mandy's estranged mother Lorraine, who appeared from March 2012. Linda Henry played Lorraine originally from 1991-1992 but Henry was already appearing in EastEnders as a different character, Shirley Carter, so the role of Lorraine was recast to actress Victoria Alcock. Described as a bad mother who allowed Mandy to \\"run wild on the streets\\" in her teenage years, it was suggested that Lorraine had not altered and remained a \\"brash\\" character. Lorraine's return was scripted to cause problems in Mandy's relationship with Ian and, according to Alcock, it was also intended to give viewers an insight into why Mandy turned out the way she had. Discussing Lorraine and Mandy's relationship Alcock said, \\"We've obviously seen Mandy go through hell and back. She's had her moments, and once you meet her mother, you understand how this poor girl has ended up like she is. Poor little love didn't stand a chance with a mother like [Lorraine]\\". Alcock added, \\"Many Albert Square residents didn't think there was a bigger leech than Mandy, but we see where she gets it from now. She has no qualms and she's proud of it. Allegedly she let some awful things happen to Mandy, which may come out in time. I think viewers are interested in the broken shells of a character and she's definitely a broken shell. You're not just made that way, something happens to make you like that. I reckon she was abused, and the abused often then become the abuser, and unfortunately that vicious circle has not been broken. I've tried to play her with a few levels.\\" Stapleton added that \\"Lorraine puts on a big act for Ian. Mandy can see straight through her, but Ian doesn't understand why she's getting her knickers in a twist. When Lorraine's alone with Mandy, she's really cruel and cold. But she's very careful how she acts in front of everyone else.\\" Stapleton was unsure whether this storyline would ultimately change viewer perception of Mandy: \\"When you play a really prickly character like Mandy, it's nice to take a look at why they behave like that. Whether it'll make viewers warm to her, I don't know. People love Mandy when she's awful!\\". Stapleton suggested that Mandy was petrified of Lorraine and she described scenes between the characters as dark and violent. Scenes airing in May 2012 where Lorraine informs Mandy that she never loved her were described by Stapleton as challenging and emotional to film. The storyline ended bleakly with Lorraine dying before Mandy could make amends with her mother. Departure (2012) On 4 April 2012, it was reported on the website Digital Spy that Mandy would be leaving EastEnders in mid-2012. Viewers were kept guessing as to whether she and Ian would marry. Mandy's departure circled around Ian's fragile emotional and mental state resulting from financial ruin and his brother Ben's confession that he murdered Heather Trott. During these events, Ian decided to bring his wedding to Mandy forward, despite her reservations following the death of her mother. Additionally, Ian's daughter Lucy tries everything she can to stop the ceremony, canceling the venue, throwing the wedding rings away, and finally giving Ian an ultimatum to choose her or Mandy. An EastEnders spokesperson told the Daily Star: “By the morning of Ian and Mandy’s wedding Lucy has done everything she can to stop it happening. The only thing she has left to do is plead with her dad to come to his senses. When he refuses she tells him he must choose. It’s either Mandy or her and she means it. She tells him she will walk out of his life forever if he goes through with the wedding.” In the storyline, when Lucy forced Ian to pick between her and Mandy, he chose Mandy. Racked with guilt about being picked over Lucy and realizing that she never truly loved Ian, Mandy left the square, leaving a pleading Ian begging her to marry him. Mandy's exit proved the final straw for Ian's parlous emotional state, causing him to have a nervous breakdown; Ian is shown walking down a motorway, barefoot in his pajamas at the end of the episode, leaving his family and viewers unsure of where he had gone. Of her decision to leave EastEnders Stapleton commented, \\"I've had a great time at EastEnders, working with friends old and new. Who knows whether Mandy will return? Let's hope it doesn't take another 17 years!\\". A spokesperson added that \\"EastEnders bosses kept Nicola on for longer than expected as they are building up to a big storyline for Ian.\\" The culmination of the storyline was scripted to coincide and facilitate actor Adam Woodyatt's temporary break from the soap opera, with his character Ian being off-screen for approximately six weeks following his breakdown. Of Mandy's return arc, Stapleton commented: \\"I don't want to play someone who's normal and boring — I want somebody who's feisty and spicy. I love Mandy. She's got layers, I think — she's deep and she's troubled. It's been really nice, actually, with the last few storylines that I had with Vicky Alcock who played my mum. It's fine to put a character on the telly and say, 'Oh, what a horrible person', but it's nice to explain why people might be like that. I think they tackled those storylines really well. It's been a nice journey with her this time round because it's been a lot more explanatory. As I say, it's had a lot more layers so I've really enjoyed it\\". When asked whether she would return as Mandy, Stapleton said, \\"It's always open, so you never know — never say never. I never said last time that I would never go back. I enjoyed it so much more than I really thought I was going to. It was lovely meeting the new people and cast that I hadn't worked with before.\\" Other appearances Mandy was featured in a special episode of the popular science fiction series, Doctor Who, which was entitled Dimensions in Time (1993). The episode was specially screened as part of BBC's annual fund- raising event, Children in Need. Viewers were asked to phone in and vote which EastEnders character, Mandy or 'Big' Ron (Ron Tarr), would appear in the show and save the Doctor from certain death. Two versions were filmed for each voting outcome, but the Mandy version won with 56% of the vote.\\"Doctor Who & Children In Need\\", Den of Geek. URL last accessed on 22 July 2009. Reception Mandy won the award for Soap's Biggest Bitch at the 1993 Inside Soap TV Awards. According to Josephine Monroe, author of The EastEnders Programme Guide, Mandy Salter was one of the most hated characters on television during her reign; a \\"teenager from hell\\". Stapleton has alleged that some viewers hated Mandy so much, due to her despicable deeds on-screen, that she was subjected to taunts in the street and her car was regularly vandalised. Underpinning the character of Mandy was a storyline about child abuse, and Stapleton has revealed that she received \\"a lot\\" of letters from children in the same situation. She commented, \\"You want to help but all you are really permitted to do is say this is Childline's number and encourage them to talk to someone.\\" Mandy's return in 2011, after a 17-year hiatus, was well received by Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror. Simon stated, \\"For an all- too-brief time in the 90s [Mandy] was the Square’s number-one troublemaker [...] it’s great to have her back.\\" In October 2011, Stapleton suggested that viewers had reacted positively to Mandy's return. Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that she was not convinced by Mandy and Ian's relationship. She predicted that it would only take six months before Mandy ran away with a younger male. Kate White from the same magazine was sad because Mandy was leaving in 2012; she said Mandy had been \\"wasted in the endless on-off-on-off-on-off-zzzzz romance with Ian\\". She hoped that Mandy would return in the future \\"as a proper bitch\\" with a \\"proper plot\\".

Besides being the chief justice, he also remained the chairman of the Delimitation Commission from June 1956 to July 1958. He retired on May 2, 1960. Munir invoked the doctrine of necessity, validating the dissolution of the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. The assembly was dissolved on October 24, 1954, by Governor General Ghulam Muhammad, an alumnus of Aligarh Muslim University. He has been widely criticized for validating the dissolution, although some of the Pakistani politicians had called for its dissolution. Writings Justice Munir also wrote a book From Jinnah to Zia, arguing that Jinnah stood for a secular state.

The Shipyard Railway was funded by the United States Maritime Commission and was built and operated by the Key System, a local transit company in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. The Key System also provided commuter rail service between San Francisco and the East Bay over the Bay Bridge. The Shipyard Railway ran from a specially constructed depot at 40th Street and San Pablo Avenue in Emeryville, up San Pablo Avenue northward (along the Key System's No. 2 San Pablo Avenue line streetcar tracks) to Grayson Street in Berkeley then two blocks west to Ninth Street, then a far stretch north along Ninth (along the recently abandoned Interurban Electric Railway's No. 5 Ninth Street line's tracks), across a bridge over Codornices Creek, then diagonally northwest across Albany Village, a federal housing project for war workers, then up and over a specially constructed trestle above the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Eastshore Highway, thence continuing northwest along the bayshore in Richmond, and terminating in a loop line serving the four massive shipyards of Kaiser. The line was built from scrap and available materials, as the war made regular construction materials unavailable. The rails were reused from abandoned streetcar lines. The railroad across the Bay Bridge no longer needed overhead wire, as the Key bridge units operated over the bridge using a third rail and both the Southern Pacific (IER) and Sacramento Northern Railway had discontinued service. For the trestle over the Southern Pacific Railroad, bridge beams were fashioned out of used Southern Pacific turntables, and timbers were reused from those ferry moles no longer in use due to the Bay Bridge. The United States Maritime Commission searched and found obsolete New York City \\"El\\" elevated cars awaiting scrap. These wood-bodied cars had been built in 1890 for the New York City IRT Second Avenue Line, initially pulled by steam locomotives and equipped with traction motors and controls prior to 1900. The cars were configured for high-level platforms and third rail, and were roughly adapted to street operation from overhead wire. The Key System did not possess enough pantographs for every car, so they placed one on each married pair of cars. This too proved challenging, as the old wood roofs could not support the weight of a pantograph. Some high level platforms were built, and the Key System's newest cars, \\"Bridge Units\\", were operated on the line while a limited number of New York cars were equipped with makeshift steps to street level. These cars became the symbol of the Shipyard Railway. At the end of World War II, the Shipyard Railway was offered to the Key System, but they declined, viewing the line as unprofitable. Service ended on September 30, 1945, and the line was quickly dismantled. Shipyard cars #561 and #563, a married pair, are preserved at the Western Railway Museum. #561 is restored and is believed to be the oldest operational electric car in the United States. #563 is under restoration.

From its inception, The Irrawaddy has taken an independent stance on Burmese politics. As a publication produced by former Burmese activists who fled violent crackdowns on anti-military protests in 1988, it has always been closely associated with the pro-democracy movement, although it remains unaffiliated with any of the political groups that have emerged since the 8888 Uprising. The Irrawaddy is published in both English and Burmese, with a primary focus on Burma and Southeast Asia. It is regarded as one of the foremost journalistic publications dealing with political, social, economic and cultural developments in Burma. In addition to news, it features in-depth political analysis and interviews with a wide range of Burma experts, business leaders, democracy activists and other influential figures. History It was started in 1990 with the name Burma Issues. The founder is Aung Zaw, a student activist from Rangoon University who left the country after the 1988 imposition of martial law and started the Burma Information Group (BIG) in Bangkok. The BIG initially circulated The Irrawaddy amongst foreign embassies, human rights groups and the Burmese exile community to update on developments inside Burma in the wake of the suppression of the pro-democracy movement and the consolidation of military control under the State Law and Order Restoration Council. The BIG’s main offices were relocated to Chiang Mai, Thailand in 1995-96, and the organization was renamed the Irrawaddy Publishing Group in 1999 to coincide with an expansion of the magazine's focus to include other political issues in Southeast Asia. The organization’s online service was launched in 2000 to provide more regular coverage of breaking news, notably the fallout from the 2003 banking crisis and the downfall of senior junta leader Khin Nyunt. In 2012, following legislative reforms to end Burma’s decades-old system of prepublication censorship and the granting of new media licenses, The Irrawaddy opened a bureau in Rangoon and gradually moved its editorial operations into the country, while maintaining a legacy presence in Chiang Mai. The Irrawaddy formerly published a monthly English language magazine and a weekly Burmese language journal, both of which were circulated in Burma and Thailand. Its English and Burmese language websites are updated daily. The editor of the English edition is Kyaw Zwa Moe, younger brother of Aung Zaw, who was jailed for eight years while a high school student in Rangoon and joined The Irrawaddy after his release. The publication has been widely cited in international media and wire services over the years. An exclusive interview with US President Barack Obama, coinciding with his second visit to Burma in 2014, received extensive coverage in the western press. The English language print edition of The Irrawaddy ceased publication in September 2015, while the Burmese language edition was halted in January. Editorial stance The Irrawaddy was an outspoken and strident critic of the State Law and Order Restoration Council and its successor, the State Peace and Development Council. Towards the end of the junta era, it criticized the protracted drafting of the 2008 Constitution by the military, and highlighted irregularities in the conduct of the 2010 general elections. Since the election of a civilian government, the magazine has questioned the sincerity of the country’s political and economic reforms, and called for an end to the military’s ongoing presence in political affairs. Since her release from house arrest, The Irrawaddy has also at times been critical of National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party. While not formally affiliated with any of Burma’s myriad pro-democracy groups, The Irrawaddy has given a platform to members of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, the 88 Generation Students Group, and other civil society groups. It has reported extensively on ongoing conflicts between the military and ethnic armed groups, and recent protests over land seizures and education reforms. Hacking attempts The Irrawaddy's websites were subjected to Distributed Denial of Service attacks during the Saffron Revolution, and again on the uprising's anniversary in 2008 and 2010, which temporarily shut down both its English and Burmese online editions. On 12 March 2011, The Irrawaddy was hacked by unknown attackers who posted fake articles on the magazine’s website. One of the articles alleged a feud between Aung Zaw and Aung San Suu Kyi, claiming that the National League for Democracy leader had encouraged funding cuts for exiled media that have forced a number of organisations, including The Irrawaddy and Democratic Voice of Burma, to cut programmes and fire staff. Another article alleged the death of popular singer May Sweet in a London traffic accident. Both stories were quickly flagged as fictitious, and Aung Zaw later speculated that the attack was launched by a pro-military junta group or Naypyidaw's cyber warfare department. On October 2, 2014, The Irrawaddy’s website was hacked by a group apparently sympathetic to the radical Buddhist 969 Movement, which rose to prominence after the outbreak of intercommunal riots across Burma in 2012. Prompted by the website's syndication of a wire story reporting a cooperation agreement between the 969 Movement and Sri Lanka’s Bodu Bala Sena Buddhist nationalist organization, the front page was defaced to read: “Irrawaddy supports Jihad and Radical Muslims. For the defend of Muslims and Allah, Irrawaddy have shown attacking Buddhists and others Non-Muslims with Media News (sic).” Awards * In January 2014, Aung Zaw was announced as the 2013 winner of the Shorenstein Prize for his work with the Irrawaddy Publishing Group. * In November 2014, Aung Zaw was presented with an International Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists, citing The Irrawaddy’s coverage of Burma as “authoritative and independent”. Criticism Before media reforms in 2012 allowed exile media organizations to establish an official presence in Burma, The Irrawaddy relied on a network of stringers and sources operating inside the country and communicating developments back to Chiang Mai by telephone. In some instances, inaccurate reports were published on political developments during the transfer of power from the State Peace and Development Council to the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw after the 2010 general elections: * On August 27, 2010, The Irrawaddy reported the resignation of Senior General Than Shwe. The report proved to be false when state-run newspapers referred to him as Senior General three days later. Than Shwe ultimately resigned his commission six months later, dissolving the State Peace and Development Council in March 2011 as Thein Sein assumed the presidency of the new government. * On February 10, 2011, citing an anonymous senior government official and \\"sources close to the military\\", The Irrawaddy alleged that Tatmadaw Commander in Chief Than Shwe would head a 'State Supreme Council', an extra-constitutional body which would exercise power over the new parliamentary government. The report was soon further spread by other foreign and exile media including Asian Correspondent and Democratic Voice of Burma, and was eventually referred to in an April 2011 resolution by United States Republican senators Richard Lugar, Mitch McConnell and Jim Inhofe. Reports of the council’s existence eventually proved to be incorrect, although the amount of influence Than Shwe exerts on senior political and military leaders in Burma continues to be a matter of debate.

McDevitt (December 28, 1906 - December 6, 1994) was the eleventh Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus from 1964 to 1977.  Early life and education  Born in Malden, Massachusetts on December 28, 1906, McDevitt was the son of John F. McDevitt and Margaret Agnes ( Sullivan). He attended Imaculate Conception School and then Boston College High School. He earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree from Boston College in 1928 and 1929, respectively.  Career   Educator  McDevitt taught history at Lincoln Junior High School in Malden, and then was then made principal on December 17, 1935. Shortly thereafter, elections were held and a new School Committee was elected. The new Committee rescinded his appointment on January 26, 1936. McDevitt sued, and the case was dismissed by the Supreme Judicial Court in 1937. On August 22, 1942 he was made superintendent of Waltham Public Schools. He served in this position until December 7, 1961 when he resigned to focus on his work as Deputy Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus. The School Street Middle School was named after him in Waltham. He was nominated to the state Board of Education in 1951 and served for nine years. He served on that board with fellow State Deputy Frank W. Tomasello.  Knights of Columbus  In 1932, McDevitt joined the Santa Maria Council of the Knights of Columbus in Malden. He held several positions, including serving as grand knight twice. He then rose through the chairs of the state council and was made State Deputy of Massachusetts on May 11, 1948. McDevitt was largely responsible for getting a law passed by the Great and General Court of Massachusetts allowing fraternal societies such as the Knights of Columbus to sell insurance in the Commonwealth. It was signed by Governor Paul A. Dever, a past grand knight from the Mt. Pleasant Council in West Roxbury. McDevitt also played a role in the defeat of the legalization of birth control in the 1948 referendum. He was made Master of the Fourth Degree in Massachusetts in 1952 and a Supreme Director in 1955. On October 21, 1960, he was elected Deputy Supreme Knight and on February 22, 1964, he became the 11th Supreme Knight. As Supreme Knight, he ended discrimination against black people in 1964 and asked the Supreme Council to consider admitting women in 1969. By 1970, some states had legalized abortion. McDevitt responded to this trend at the 1970 convention, defining the Knights as a pro-life organization. He said, \\"We, the knights of today, likewise must serve in the role of protectors...we must be the knights who hold up the banner of life. We must be for life.\\" In 1973, after the Roe v. Wade ruling, the Supreme Convention passed a resolution supporting a pro- life constitutional amendment. McDevitt denounced Roe v. Wade as \\"shocking and unfortunate\\", and urged councils to take local action to \\"offset the harmful effects of this lamentable decision.\\" In 1975, the Knights donated $50,000 to the US bishops in support of pro-life efforts.  Honors  In 1971, McDevitt was honored by Pope Paul VI with the Order of Pius IX, the highest papal honor which can be conferred on a Catholic layman who is not a head of state. Pope Paul also placed McDevitt on the advisory board for Vatican City and gave him several other honors. He also won the 1966 Brotherhood Award from B'Nai B'rith. McDevitt held honorary degrees from Saint Michael's College, The Catholic University of America, and Boston College.  Personal life  With his wife Mary Cecilia Kelley McDevitt, he had two sons, John Kelley McDevitt and William Paul McDevitt. John Kelley became assistant Supreme Advocate in 1975. In 1998, after his death, the delegates at the Supreme Council meeting established a scholarship fund in his name.

The Sedleian Chair was founded by Sir William Sedley who, by his will dated 20 October 1618, left the sum of £2,000 to the University of Oxford for purchase of lands for its endowment. Sedley's bequest took effect in 1621 with the purchase of an estate at Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire to produce the necessary income. It is regarded as the oldest of Oxford's scientific chairs. Holders of the Sedleian Professorship have, since the mid 19th Century, worked in a range of areas of Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Physics. They are simultaneously elected to fellowships at Queen's College, Oxford. The Sedleian Professors in the past century have been Augustus Love (1899-1940), who was distinguished for his work in the mathematical theory of elasticity, Sydney Chapman (1946-1953), who is renowned for his contributions to the kinetic theory of gases and solar- terrestrial physics, George Temple (1953-1968), who made significant contributions to mathematical physics and the theory of generalized functions, Brooke Benjamin (1979-1995), who did highly influential work in the areas of mathematical analysis and fluid mechanics, and Sir John Ball (1996-2019), who is distinguished for his work in the mathematical theory of elasticity, materials science, the calculus of variations, and infinite-dimensional dynamical systems.

He graduated M.A. from Christ Church, Oxford in 1642, and in the 1640s was one of the royal physicians to Charles I of England. One of several Oxford cliques of those interested in science grew up around Willis and Christ Church. Besides Robert Hooke, whom Willis employed as an assistant, others in the group were Nathaniel Hodges, John Locke, Richard Lower, Henry Stubbe and John Ward. (Locke went on to study with Thomas Sydenham, who would become Willis's leading rival, and with whom, both politically and medically, he held some incompatible views.) In the broader Oxford scene, he was a member of the \\"Oxford Club\\" of experimentalists with Ralph Bathurst, Robert Boyle, William Petty, John Wilkins and Christopher Wren. In 1656 and 1659 he published two significant medical works, De Fermentatione and De Febribus. These were followed by the 1664 volume on the brain, which was a record of collaborative experimental work. From 1660 until his death, he was appointed to the Sedleian professorship. He was also a founding member of the Royal Society. Willis later worked as a physician in Westminster, London, this coming about after he treated Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1666.

The ship was laid down in April 1943 and launched one month later, but because the Barber brothers' mother was not available on the day of launching, the ship was christened at the same time that she was commissioned in October 1943. After a year of service in the Atlantic escorting convoys and helping to sink , Barber was converted to a and assigned the new hull code of APD-57. After her conversion was complete in January 1945, Barber sailed for duty in the Pacific. After earning three battle stars for her wartime service, Barber was decommissioned in March 1946 and placed in reserve. After 22 years of inactivity, Barber was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in November 1968, and transferred to the Mexican Navy the following February as ARM Coahuila (B07). In 1994, she was renamed ARM Vincente Guerrero after former Mexican president Vicente Guerrero. The ship was later restored to her original Mexican name of Coahuila with a new pennant number of E21, before she was stricken from the rolls of the Mexican Navy in July 2001. Her ultimate fate is unreported in secondary sources.  U.S. Navy career  Barber (DE-161) was laid down on 27 April 1943 at Portsmouth, Virginia, by the Norfolk Navy Yard and was launched on 24 May 1943. However, because the sponsor, Mrs. Peter Thomas Barber, the mother of the Barber brothers, could not be present at the launching of the ship, Barbers christening was delayed until the day of her commissioning, 10 October 1943, when the two ceremonies were held simultaneously. Mrs. Barber christened the ship, and USS Barber was placed in commission, Lt. Eugene T. B. Sullivan in command. Atlantic Ocean, 1943-1944 Following shakedown training off Bermuda, the destroyer escort was assigned convoy duty along the Atlantic coast. She escorted troopships to Panama as her first duty and, on her return trip northward, escorted the crippled New Zealand light cruiser to Boston. Although they arrived in Boston on 23 December, Barber could not spend Christmas in port. Instead, she pulled out of the harbor on Christmas Day and headed for North Africa escorting a convoy of 95 merchantmen. She arrived in Casablanca, French Morocco, after an uneventful transatlantic crossing. While waiting for a return convoy, she patrolled the Strait of Gibraltar for several days in search of German submarines. After another uneventful voyage, the ship left the convoy at Norfolk and continued on to the New York Navy Yard. She spent most of February and March 1944 performing escort duties between New York and Norfolk; and, then, on 24 March, received orders to join an anti- submarine \\"hunter killer\\" group TG 21.15, built around and joined by four other destroyer escorts. Formed to hunt German U-boats, the group recorded its first success on 26 April when Barber and the escorts , , and , teamed up to sink the at . Relieved by another hunter killer group, Barbers unit headed for home on 11 May. After a brief availability at the New York Navy Yard and two weeks of maneuvers at Casco Bay, Maine, Barber resumed her convoy escort duties. She made two more transatlantic voyages to North Africa before October 1944 but did not encounter any enemy ships. On 9 October, Barber entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion to a Charles Lawrence-class high speed transport. Although she was reclassified APD-57 on 23 October, she did not complete the preparations for her new role until January 1945. On the 17th, she left Philadelphia and proceeded to Norfolk's convoy escort piers. For a month, the fast transport served as \\"school ship\\" for crews of APD's not yet commissioned. Each day she got underway to train these crews in evolutions such as fueling, gunfire, target tracking, and other combat procedures. Pacific Ocean, 1945-1946 On George Washington's Birthday, the warship steamed out of Norfolk bound for the Pacific and her first combat duty as a high speed transport. After a short stay in San Diego, she continued on westward and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 26 March. The fast transport then conducted specialized training at Maui with Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT's). The mission of such teams was to destroy obstacles on landing beaches, and APD's such as Barber delivered these teams to the areas four or five days before the actual invasion. Just two days after receiving word of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 12 April death, she sailed via Eniwetok for Ulithi. Barber arrived there on 30 April and spent five days preparing for front line duty at Okinawa. She departed the safety of Ulithi with a merchant convoy on 5 May and continually felt the presence of the enemy through possible submarine contacts, floating mines, and radio message traffic emanating from Okinawa. The high-speed transport anchored in Hagushi Anchorage on 10 May and, throughout the daylight hours, heard not a sound from the Japanese. However, with sunset, the Japanese air attacks began in earnest. On 11 May, Barber received orders to assist on a radar picket station north of the anchorage. That destroyer had been hit by two kamikaze planes and two bombs. Barber mustered all the hands she could spare to help evacuate the injured from Hugh W. Hadley and then to work on saving the damaged warship. The fast transport assumed picket duty north of Ie Shima on the 12th. The enemy never came close by air; but, on 15 May, Barber picked up four Japanese soldiers in a raft and later transferred them to an Army boat for internment in an Okinawa camp. Barbers good luck continued to hold. Every picket station on which she served had been the scene of a casualty either immediately before her duty there or would become one soon after she departed. On 20 May, the Japanese directed a massive force of midget submarines, mines and kamikaze aircraft at the Allied naval forces. Barber pursued two midget submarines and evaluated one as a \\"probable kill.\\" The high speed transport continued on patrol, enduring nightly general quarters alarms for Japanese air raids. On 14 June, she captured three more prisoners. On the evening of 16 June, while Barber stood rescue-ship watch at anchor off Hagushi, suffered a hit by air raiders and sank within an hour. Barber rushed to the area immediately to search for survivors. The fast transport worked through the night assisting in the rescue of the 188 sailors who survived before returning to the anchorage early the next morning. Released from duty at Okinawa on Independence Day 1945, Barber joined a convoy of four other escorts and 32 LSTs headed for Saipan. One day out of Saipan, Barber received orders to accompany a part of the convoy to Guam. Her new course took her across the routes used by American B-29 bombers headed for the Japanese mainland. On 9 July, the fast transport received word of a nearby crash of a returning bomber. Barber raced to the site and, despite fears of complete destruction, over the distance of approximately 20 miles the \\"Barber\\" following the path of the bomber back toward Japan began to retrieve the crew picking up the captain first, since he was the last one to jump from the plane. In the end, all 11 members of the bomber's crew were remarkably rescued.Stempien The fast transport took them to Guam the next day. Barber remained at Guam until 21 July when she sailed for Ulithi escorting escort carrier . She continued on to Leyte Gulf where she screened battleships and on 8, 9 and 10 August and then returned to Leyte to await further orders. While there, the news of Japan's capitulation reached Barber and she headed for Okinawa escorting Mississippi and her sistership . Arriving on 21 August, she departed the next day for a brief visit to Manila Bay. On 2 September, the fast transport commenced three weeks of duty in Subic Bay, at the conclusion of which she moved to Lingayen Gulf to join Transport Division (TransDiv) 20. From there, she led a procession of 20 transports for occupation duty. The group entered Wakanoura Bay at Honshū on 7 October and passed three slow weeks while minesweepers cleared a channel to Nagoya. Finally, TransDiv 20 was able to enter the channel safely while Barber remained behind to control the harbor entrance. The crew of the \\"Barber\\" went ashore in the city of Nagasaki, which had been destroyed by the second atomic bomb making each member of the crew an \\"atomic\\" veteran. After another three weeks of screening incoming and outgoing ships, the transport received orders to load passengers to capacity and return home. On 21 November, she embarked on the long voyage home. After steaming via Sasebo, Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, San Diego, and Panama, Barber returned to the east coast for pre-inactivation overhaul, and was decommissioned on 22 May 1946. Barber received three battle stars for her World War II service. She was berthed with the reserve fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida, and remained there for more than two decades. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 November 1968, and she was sold to the government of Mexico on 22 December 1969.  Mexican Navy career  The former Barber was acquired by the Mexican Navy on 22 December 1969 and renamed ARM Coahuila (B07). In 1994, she was renamed ARM Vincente Guerrero, but later reverted to her original Mexican name of Coahuila, but with a new pennant number of E21. Coahuila was stricken from the rolls of Mexican Navy on 16 July 2001. Her ultimate fate is unreported in secondary sources.

He was drafted by the Brisbane Bears as a zone selection in 1995. Voss, now with the Lions, made his debut in 1997 but was delisted at the end of 2000, struggling to gain selection in a successful Brisbane side, and over-shadowed by his older brother, Brownlow Medallist Michael Voss. The St Kilda Football Club, under the leadership of then coach Malcolm Blight, recruited Voss in the 2001 pre-season draft. His 2001 season with the club was inconsistent, but he played 19 matches and found some confidence. It was in 2002 that Voss came into his own as an AFL footballer. He played almost every match between 2004 and 2006 for the Saints, who played finals in each of those three seasons. Voss played in St Kilda’s 2004 AFL Wizard Home Loans Cup winning side – St Kilda Football Club’s 2nd AFL Cup Win. Voss became known for his courage, and often played well above his height in defence. A feature of his game during 2004 and 2005 was his strong marking in the backline, and Voss was one of the Saints' toughest and most reliable players during his time at the club. Voss won Network Ten's Before The Game 'Tool of the Year' award in 2004. The 2006 season saw Voss have close to his best year, racking up 350 possessions, 140 marks and kicking 15 goals for the year playing in a new role as a half- forward. He finished 10th in the 2006 B&F.; Voss entered the 2007 season struggling with injury, and was unable to hold a place in the side. There was a perception that he had lost some pace, and Voss did not reach his previous standards in his 11 matches for the year. After some deliberation at the end of the season, and after consultation with coach Ross Lyon, 29-year-old Voss announced his retirement on 18 September 2007 . Brett Voss now plays for the Old Haileyburians Amateur Football Club. Voss finished his career with 170 games of AFL football in a career that spanned 11 seasons at the elite level.

Ross was the first general director of the Seattle Opera, serving that company from 1963 to 1983, and the second general director of the Arizona Opera, from 1983 to 1998. Background He was born Glynn W. Aus to a Norwegian immigrant father and a mother of Swedish descent, in Omaha, Nebraska. He attended the local schools and, upon graduation from high school, managed his family's farm for five years. After his father's death, and with the encouragement of his mother, Ross left Nebraska to pursue his dream of a career in theatre, attending the Leland Powers School of the Theatre, the alma mater of his high school drama teacher, in Boston from 1937 to 1939. After early involvement in theatre and opera, Ross was drafted into the U.S. Army and served for the duration of World War II. After recovering from a wound received in North Africa, he was sent back to Europe by the Army, charged with operating a rest camp for soldiers on the Italian island of Ischia. He was one of the first patients ever to be administered penicillin, still in its test phase. During this time and with the Army's encouragement, he staged operas in Naples for the entertainment of U.S. troops there. Career In 1948 he was hired by the San Francisco Opera as stage director. During the 1950s, Ross staged operas for various companies in the United States, but in 1959 moved to Naples, where he became the first American to stage an opera for the Teatro di San Carlo. In 1964, Ross relocated to Seattle, having been offered the directorship in late 1963 of the new opera company being formed there. During his tenure with the Seattle Opera, he gained notice for his attention-grabbing promotional efforts and earned the nickname \\"the P. T. Barnum of opera\\". He used skywriting and bumper stickers, among other unusual advertising techniques. In addition, his slogans for his productions were often aimed at the emerging youth culture, such as the irreverent slogans, \\"La Boheme: Six old-time hippies in Paris\\" and \\"Romeo et Juliette: Two kids in trouble, real trouble, with their families.\\" His slogan \\"Get Ahead with Salome\\" ruffled the feathers of more traditional operagoers. It was the policy in Seattle to stage all operas both in the original language and in English. In 1975, he oversaw Seattle Opera's production of the Ring Cycle, making Seattle the first American company, other than the Metropolitan Opera, to attempt Richard Wagner's masterwork in its entirety during a single week. In Seattle, Ross was also noted for his ability to pare administrative expenses and keep the company on a sound financial footing. In 1970, Ross was a cofounder of Opera America, an industry trade association for American opera companies, with the goal of enabling companies to share resources, information, and expertise. In 1971, the Seattle Opera staged Tommy, the rock opera written by The Who, with Bette Midler in a starring role. On his ability to attract top opera stars to Seattle, at that time not considered a major center for opera, he explained: \\"An artist wants four things: one, a chance to do something that requires the best of his abilities; two, the opportunity to grow by singing different roles; three, prestige; and four, a paycheck.\\" Upon Ross's departure from the Seattle Opera, he was offered the top post at the struggling Arizona Opera in 1983, where he both expanded the company's offerings and restored it to financial health. He oversaw production of two Ring Cycles as summer festivals in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1996 and 1998, bold undertakings for a middle-sized opera company. His 1996 cycle, in particular, gained favorable notice. Ross retired from Arizona Opera in 1998 Personal life He met Angelamaria Solimene in Naples and married her on November 15, 1946. They had four children. He died from a stroke on July 21, 2005. References *Glynn Ross, 90, Put Seattle On the Map for Opera Lovers (New York Times, July 26, 2005, p.

The band took its name from the ancient Latin translation for \\"Dead Winter\\". Starting out, the South Florida band's primary goal was to create some of the most crushing and extreme music ever recorded. Taking influence from a variety of sources, musically the band took inspiration from the old- school death metal bands like Incantation, Autopsy, Morbid Angel, Death, Dismember, Immolation, Entombed, Obituary, Vader and Suffocation just to name a few. The band's sound is mainly categorised as death metal, with definite black metal and doom metal influence. Hibernus Mortis has been a staple of the legendary Florida death metal scene for over a decade and have fans all around the world from as far away as Germany, Norway and Iceland, Cuba, to South Africa, Singapore, and Australia. The band has always retained an underground low-key status, but definitely sporting a modest cult following. The band is currently based out of Hialeah, Florida.  Members  Over the years the band has gone through several line-up changes, with the only core member being Cesar Placeres.

The band's songs deal with a wide variety of topics including the apocalypse, death, suffering, revenge, solitude, and hatred. On rare occasion the band has been known to get lyrical inspiration from movies. Two movies in particular have inspired songs: The Prophecy and Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend.  Guitar sound  Since the beginning, one of the band's most distinguishing qualities was their ridiculously de-tuned and ferocious guitar sound. Hibernus Mortis was one of the pioneers of the still-rare practice of tuning to \\"G\\". Aside from the ultra low tuning, the band achieves their trademark guitar sound through the use of thick strings and unconventional equipment.

He was also known by the name Pepe Milla and the pseudonym Salomé Jil. Son of a governor of the state of Honduras in the Federal Republic of Central America, José Justo de la Milla y Pineda and Mrs. Mercedes Vidaurre Molina, the daughter of a wealthy Guatemalan family. He was married to his cousin, Mercedes Vidaurre and had 7 daughters and sons. Milla grew up in a time of great instability, where the struggles between liberals and conservatives were bringing chaos to Guatemala. He came from a well-to-do family and was not a politically relevant figure. However, it is known that he had conservative tendencies and came to public office under conservative governments. His works can be qualified under various literary genres, although they were mainly dedicated to story-telling, novels and more specifically historical novels. His main theme was life in the colonial Guatemala. His \\"novelas costumbristas\\" are about the customs of Guatemalan people during colonial times and during the first years after Guatemalan independence.

Hari Mata Hari is the stage name for the singer Hajrudin \\"Hari\\" Varešanović. The group originated from the city of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The group has performed over 1,000 concerts and sold 5 million albums to date. Their songs are among the most famous and popular love ballads in the former Yugoslavia era. Hari Mata Hari was the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 held in Athens, Greece. Coincidentally, hari mata hari is Malay for 'day of the sun, or Sunday'. The Group The band, Hari Mata Hari, has constantly changed its members. Today, the group is composed of Hajrudin Varešanović (vocal), Izudin Izo Kolečić (drums), Lordan Muzaferija (bass gitar), Dzenan Selmanagic(electirc guita), and Adis Vuga (keyboards). Most of the Hari Mata Hari's songs are arranged by Hajrudin Varešanović. The lyrics are primarily written by Fahrudin Pecikoza - also known as Peco. Hari grew up in the Vratnik neighborhood of Sarajevo's old town. His grandfather was one of the more well-known singers of traditional Bosnian music called sevdalinke. At the age of six, Hajrudin began to sing and learned to play the guitar. At the local cultural center, he was asked to sing, then at the age of ten he sang with the group \\"Omi\\", and later for the group \\"Sedam šuma\\". In Vratnik, Hari recorded his first song \\"Zašto da ne uzmem nju\\". (Why don't I take her) After finishing electrical school, Varešanović began to study Philosophy and attended classes of natural politics, but he never completed the courses. Music took up much of his time, as did his love of photography. In 1979, Hari joined the group Zov with whom he recorded the hit song \\"Poletjela golubica sa Baščaršije.\\" Next, Varešanović sang with the group \\"Ambasadori\\", with whom, it is said, that he matured into a professional artist. After serving his mandatory military service in the town of Niš, he appeared on the music scene by himself releasing the (1984) album Zlatne Kočije. In September 1985, Hari Varešanović together with the group members of Baobab - Izo Kolečić, Edo Mulahalilović, Pjer Žalica, and Zoran Kesić - won the festival Nove nade, nove snage (New hopes, new strengths) organised by Želimir Altarac Čičak, and created the musical group Hari Mata Hari. That same year, the new group announced the release of their new album U tvojoj kosi. (In your hair) In 1986, Pjer Žalica - \\"Badžo\\" and Zoran Kesić left the group. They were replaced by pianist Adi Mulihalilović and bass player Neno Jeleč, who will eventually be replaced by Željko Zuber. Their album of 1986, Ne bi te odbranila ni cijela Jugoslavija, (Not even all of Yugoslavia could defend you) was voted as the best album of the year, and Jugovision, the national competition for Eurovision, announced them as the candidate for Yugoslavia. Hari Mata Hari, in 1986, received fifth place for the song \\"U tvojoj kosi (In your hair),\\" and fourteenth place for the song \\"Nebeska kraljica\\" in 1987 in Belgrade. 1988 brought much prosperity to the group. Hari began to record for the recording company Jugoton, based in Zagreb. The album \\"Ja te volim najviše na svijetu\\" (I love you the most in the world) from 1988 sold over 300,000 copies, and carried 10 songs that are still popular (2006) - (\\"Igrale se delije\\", \\"Javi se\\", \\"Sedamnaest ti je godina\\" (You're 17) with Tatjana Matejaš-Tajči, \\"Naše malo misto\\", \\"Ja te volim najviše na svijetu\\" (I love you the most in the world), \\"Hej, kako si\\" (Hey, how are you?), \\"Zapleši\\" (Dance), \\"Kad dođe oktobar\\" (When October comes), \\"Ruža bez trna\\", \\"Poslednji valcer sa Dunava\\"). This prosperity was followed by another great album called Volio bih da te ne volim (I wish I didn't love you), which sold over 500,000 copies - (\\"Svi moji drumovi\\", \\"Na more dođite\\" (Come to the sea), \\"Što je bilo bilo je\\", \\"Pazi šta radiš\\" (Careful what you do) with Matejaš-Tajči). Then in 1990, Hari Mata Hari releases another album called Strah me da te volim (I'm afraid to love you). This album sold over 700,000 copies - (\\"Prsten i zlatni lanac\\" (Ring and a golden necklace), \\"Otkud ti k'o sudbina\\", \\"Ostavi suze za kraj\\", \\"Daj još jednom da čujem ti glas\\", \\"Nek' nebo nam sudi\\"). The collapse of Yugoslavia and the wars that ensued, left a mark in Hari Mata Hari's career. In 1991, Edo Mulahalilović left the group to start his own career. In late 1991, the group releases the album Rođena si samo za mene (You were born only for me) through the recording company Diskoton, located in Sarajevo. Some of the songs from the album are: \\"Ja ne pijem with\\" with Haris Džinović, \\"Nije za te bekrija\\", \\"Nije zima što je zima\\", that had solid sales and success. With that album, most activity stopped, due to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In late 1994, the group released another album, while they were refugees in Germany. The album was called Ostaj mi zbogom ljubavi - \\"Bilo je lijepo dok je trajalo\\" (It was beautiful while it lasted), \\"Ti si mi droga\\" (You're my drug), \\"Ja sam kriv što sam živ\\", and cover version of song \\"Poletjela golubica\\" (The dove flew) with Halid Bešlić. This album was made only by Hari and Izo, the rest of the group would not reunite until 1997-1998. The group was composed of (besides Hari and Izo) Karlo Martinović, Miki Bodlović, Adi Mulihalilović, and Emir Mehić. They returned to the music scene with a greatest hits album called Ja nemam snage da te ne volim (I don't have the strength to not love you). It was released in 1998 - (\\"Ne lomi me\\", \\"Emina\\", \\"Ja nemam snage da te ne volim\\" (I don't have the strength to not love you), \\"Gdje li si sada ljubavi\\" (Where are you now love?), \\"Upomoć\\"). The song \\"Ja nemam snage da te ne volim\\" sounds like the Sisters Of Mercy's song \\"This Corrosion\\". In 1999 Hari Varešanović was chosen to represent Bosnia and Herzegovina for Eurovision. However, he was disqualified due to an issue with the song's status. Hari sold the song \\"Starac i more\\" (The old man and the sea) to Finland in 1997 and Finnish artist Janne Hurme recorded that song in Finnish, named \\"Sydänveri\\" (Finnish for \\"Heart Blood\\"). Dino Merlin, who was the runner up, was sent to Eurovision instead and received seventh place. Hari, together with Hanka Paldum, recorded the duet \\"Crni snijeg\\" (Black snow) in 2001. That same year (2001) the album Baš ti lijepo stoje suze came out with a few hit songs - (\\"Kao domine\\" (Like dominoes), \\"Zjenico oka moga\\", \\"Baš ti lijepo stoje suze\\"). In 2002 with the song \\"Ruzmarin\\" (Rosemary), that became an instant hit. Hari Mata Hari was one of the six finalists in the Croatian Radio Festival and represented Bosnia and Herzegovina for the OGAE in France. Also, in 2002 Hari Mata Hari won the first Davorin song of the year award, for the song \\"Kao Domine\\" (Like dominoes). The music for the song was written by Miki Bodlović and Hari Varešanović, with lyrics by Fahrudin Pecikoza. Then in 2003 Hari's song \\"Idi\\", brought him to the seventh Croatian Radio Festival with the song \\"Navodno\\" with Ivana Banfić. He then went to the Splitski festival. After Hari's small concerts on the Balkans, in Europe, and in Australia, the group began to record a new album. Franjo Valentić, Hari's long time friend joins the group, while Miki Bodlović leaves the group to start his own career in U.S. and he was replaced by Nihad Voloder. At the eighth Hrvatski radiski festival the group competed with the song \\"Nema čega nema\\". At the Splitski festival the group entered the competition with the song \\"Zakon jačega\\" (Law of the strong) recorded with Bosnian superstar singer Kemal Monteno. Later that year the group released another album under the name of the song \\"Zakon jačega\\", for Sarajevo's Diskoton, Zagreb's Croatia Records, and Belgrade's HI-FI Centar. In 2007 the group released the single: \\"Zar je to još od nas ostalo\\". In 2009 the group released the album Sreća (Luck) and this album came out with a few hit songs: \\"Azra\\", \\"Sreća\\", \\"Ne mogu ti reći što je tuga\\" with Nina Badrić, \\"Tvoje je samo to što daš\\" with Eldin Husenbegović. Nihat Voloder left the group and he was replaced by Željko Zuber. In 1999, the group played for seven days in Belgrade at the \\"Sava center\\".  Eurovision 2006  PBSBiH, through a public on-line voting system, Hari Mata Hari was chosen as the Bosnian representative for Eurovision. BH Eurosong gave the name \\"Vrijeme je za Bosnu i Hercegovinu\\" (It's time for Bosnia-Herzegovina), and the song was described as Bosnia's Romeo and Juliet. The first time the song was aired to the public was on March 5, 2006 on a special live evening celebration held by \\"BH Eurosong 06\\" in Sarajevo's theater. Hari sang the song for the first time in public and received a standing ovation. Six days later, Hari sang the song at his first stage appearance in Belgrade on the final evening of Evropesma 2006. The song \\"Lejla\\" (Composer: Željko Joksimović, Lyric writers: Fahrudin Pecikoza & Dejan Ivanovic) is a powerful love ballad about far away love. It uses styles of sevdah and local traditional instruments. The female name Lejla is a traditional Arab name. Eric Clapton and ZZ Top both used the name Leyla in their songs. It is said the title refers to a popular Bosnian song from 1981, when a song called \\"Lejla\\" was the Yugoslavian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. It was sung by Bosnian artist Seid Memić Vajta and reached 15th place in Dublin. The lyrics of the song were written by Fahrudin Pecikoza and Dejan Ivanović with the music by Željko Joksimović. Joksimović, represented Serbia and Montenegro at the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 in Istanbul (\\"Lane moje\\", second place), the song was written for non-profit and was solely voluntary. The music video of \\"Lejla\\" was directed by Pjer Žalica, along with Hari and the band. It shows many old Bosnian traditions. It was recorded in several areas of Herzegovina: on the mountains of Blidinja and on the national park/lake Hutovo Blato, on Ruištu, and in the city of Mostar. The video ends with the Stari Most, the older part of the city, in the background. The song received its name through on-line voting (with 3501 votes, other name ideas were \\"Zar bi mogla ti drugog voljeti?\\" (Could you not love another?) with 660, and \\"Sakrivena\\" with 462 votes). Hari Mata Hari took 3rd place at Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with 229 points.

Her areas of theoretical specialisation include the anthropology of violence, social suffering, and the state. Das has received multiple international awards including the Ander Retzius Gold Medal, delivered the prestigious Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture and was named a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Education Das studied at the Indraprastha College for Women and the Delhi School of Economics at the University of Delhi and taught there from 1967 to 2000. She completed her PhD in 1970 under the supervision of M. N. Srinivas from the Delhi School of Economics. She was professor of anthropology at the New School for Social Research from 1997-2000, before moving to Johns Hopkins University, where she served as chair of the Department of Anthropology between 2001 and 2008. Books Her first book Structure and Cognition: Aspects of Hindu Caste and Ritual (Oxford University Press, Delhi, 1977) brought the textual practices of 13th to 17th century in relation to self representation of caste groups in focus. Her identification of the structure of Hindu thought in terms of the tripartite division between priesthood, kinship and renunciation proved to be an extremely important structuralist interpretation of the important poles within which innovations and claims to new status by caste groups took place. Veena Das's most recent book is Life and Words: Violence and the Descent into the Ordinary (California University Press, 2006). As the title implies, Das sees violence not as an interruption of ordinary life but as something that is implicated in the ordinary. The philosopher Stanley Cavell has written a memorable foreword to the book in which he says that one way of reading it is as a companion to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations. One of the chapters in the book deals with the state of abducted women in the post-independence time period and has been the interest of various legal historians. Life and Words is heavily influenced by Wittgenstein and Stanley Cavell, but it also deals with particular moments in history such as the Partition of India and the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984. The book 'narrates the lives of particular persons and communities who were deeply embedded in these events, and it describes the way that the event attaches itself with its tentacles into everyday life and folds itself into the recesses of the ordinary.' Research Since the eighties she became engrossed in the study of violence and social suffering. Her edited book, Mirrors of Violence: Communities, Riots and Survivors in South Asia published by Oxford University Press in 1990 was one of the first to bring issues of violence within anthropology of South Asia. A trilogy on these subjects that she edited with Arthur Kleinman and others in the late nineties and early twenties gave a new direction to these fields. The volumes are titled Social Suffering; Violence and Subjectivity; and Remaking a World. Awards She received the Anders Retzius Gold Medal from the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography in 1995,(Johns Hopkins blurb) and an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago in 2000.(University of Chicago Magazine article) She is a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences(American Academy members) and a fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences. In 2007, Das delivered the Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture at the University of Rochester, considered by many to be the most important annual lecture series in the field of Anthropology.http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=524051 Prof. Das was elected as Fellow to the British Academy in 2019.

This treaty superseded a secret agreement between Ethiopia and Italy negotiated days after the decisive Battle of Adwa in March of the same year, in which Ethiopian forces commanded by Menelik II defeated the Italians.Harold Marcus, The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), pp. 174-177 The most important concession the Italians made was the abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale and recognizing Ethiopia as an independent country. Following the conclusion of this treaty and before the end of the next calendar year, the United Kingdom and France, which had colonial possessions bordering Ethiopia, also concluded treaties with Ethiopia which treated her as an equal. The treaty with France was signed in late January 1897, while the treaty with the United Kingdom was signed 14 May 1897.  Negotiating the treaty  In the Italian text of the Treaty of Wuchale, Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italy, which effectively made Ethiopia an Italian protectorate, while the Amharic version merely gave Ethiopia the option of communicating with third powers through the Italian government. Learning of this divergence from the Amharic text, Emperor Menelik believed he had been deceived by the Italians; this had led to the war between the two countries. Moreover, the Italians had been carefully encroaching on Ethiopian territory over the months between the signing of that treaty in 1889 and when hostilities began in 1895. On the other hand, his victory at Adwa resulted with Menelik being in possession of 3,000 Italian soldiers, as well as a large victorious army facing the demoralized remnants of the Italian military in Eritrea, the latter fearing they would be driven into the sea at any moment. Further, when news of the defeat reached Italy, Prime Minister Francesco Crispi was forced to resign. Ethiopian Emperor Menelik was negotiating from a position of strength. The initial Italian offer, presented by Major Tomasso Salsa 11 March, offered Menelik Italy's abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale and a new treaty of peace and friendship, but in return he remain \\"firm in his aim of not accepting the protectorate of any other power.\\" Menelik had gone to war to maintain his Empire's independence, not to exchange one master for another; according to Harold Marcus, Menelik was so enraged at this offer that he demanded the return of their secret truce, saying he would hold Major Salsa hostage until then. It was not until 23 August that the Italians finally agreed to the unconditional abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale, and recognition of the sovereign independence of Ethiopia. Once the Italians had conceded on this point, negotiations proceeded quickly. The Italian prisoners-of-war, who had enjoyed \\"reasonably benign captivity\\" (Marcus' words), would be repatriated, and Italy pay an indemnity of 10,000,000 Italian liras for their upkeep. Most surprisingly, the Italians would retain most, if not all, of the territories beyond the Mareb-Belessa and May/Muni rivers they had taken; According Abyssinian Monarchists' Menelik gave away a sizable portion of Tigray which had been treated as part of the Ethiopian empire since time immemorial.Margery Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), pp. 58f; Marcus, Menelik II, p. 175 The border between Ethiopia proper and Eritrea was further defined in a series of agreements in 1900, 1902, and 1908.

M. Cassandre in 1937. It was commissioned by the French type foundry Deberny & Peignot. The typeface is notable for not having a traditional lowercase, but in its place a \\"multi-case\\" combining traditional lowercase and small capital characters. Cassandre intended for Peignot to be used in publishing and stated that \\"[t]here is no technical reason in printing why we cannot return to the noble classical shapes of the alphabet and discard the lower case forms.\\" The typeface achieved some popularity in poster and advertising publishing from its release through the late 1940s. Stylistically Peignot is a \\"stressed\\" or modulated sans-serif in the Art Deco style, in which the vertical strokes are clearly wider than the horizontals. Use of Peignot declined with the growth of the International Typographic Style, which favored less decorative, more objective, traditional typefaces such as Akzidenz-Grotesk. Peignot experienced a revival in the 1970s as the typeface used on The Mary Tyler Moore Show (and its production company, MTM Enterprises) and the second season of That's My Mama. While often classified as \\"decorative\\", the face is a serious exploration of typographic form and legibility. It is now owned by Linotype Corp. and is distributed by both Linotype and Adobe. A very similar typeface, Chambord by Roger Excoffon, was released by the Fonderie Olive in Marseille in 1945; it had a traditional lowercase.

It was founded in 1972, by Alan Fletcher, Theo Crosby, Colin Forbes, Kenneth Grange, and Mervyn Kurlansky at Needham Road, Notting Hill, London. The company has offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Berlin and Austin, Texas. History Pentagram was founded on the premise of collaborative interdisciplinary designers working together in an independently owned firm of equals. Theo Crosby claimed the structure was suggested to him by his experience of working on the seminal late-1950s exhibition This Is Tomorrow: \\"it was my first experience at a loose, horizontal organisation of equals. We have brought it ... to a kind of practical and efficient reality at Pentagram\\".Theo Crosby, \\"The Painter as Designer\\", Edward Wright graphic work and painting, Arts Council, 1985, pp.49-50 The firm currently comprises 23 partner-designers in five cities, each managing a team of designers and sharing in common overhead and staff resources. The partners in each office share incomes equally and all the partners own an equal portion of the total firm. This equality, along with the tradition of periodically inviting new members to join, renews the firm while giving even the newest members an equal footing with the partners of long standing. This 'flat' organisation (there are no executive officers, CEO, CFO or board, other than the entire group) along with the self-capitalised finances of the business, allows equal participation and control of the group's destiny by the member. In 1978 Colin Forbes formed the New York office, eventually adding both graphic designers Peter Harrison and Woody Pirtle as partners. In 1990-91 Michael Bierut, Paula Scher, graphic designers, and James Biber, an architect, joined the New York office and eventually moved to a building at 204 Fifth Avenue, a building designed by C.

Dellums worked as a porter for the Pullman Company from 1924 to 1927 and was discharged in part due to his open support of unionization. In 1929, Dellums was elected vice president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and became president in 1966. In the 1930s, Dellums was an officer in the NAACP Branch Office in Berkeley, California. Born in Corsicana, Texas, he is the uncle of former Congressman and Mayor of Oakland Ron Dellums. Before and during Sleeping Car Porters Dellums “had chosen San Francisco as the most ideal place for a Negro to live in 1923.” Dellums also stated that the Bay Area’s colleges and professional schools were an important attraction: \\"I wanted to be a lawyer and the University of California had the best law school.” Instead, however, Dellums went to work for the Southern Pacific railroad as a Pullman porter, where he gained the respect of his black coworkers and was ultimately elected International President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.De Graaf, Lawrence Brooks., Kevin Mulroy, and Quintard Taylor. Seeking El Dorado: African Americans in California. Los Angeles: Autry Museum of Western Heritage, 2001. Print. pg 186 Dellums became the standard bearer of a growing African American labor movement in Oakland, Richmond, and San Francisco in the aftermath of the war. As Dellums would later explain, “Negroes will have to pay for their own organization, their own fights, by their own funds as well as their own energy.” Dellums’s Brotherhood and other Black railroad workers unions were built with “Negro leadership and Negro money” using the solidarity forged within sites of segregation to wage direct confrontations against racial discrimination.HoSang, Daniel. Racial Propositions: Ballot Initiatives and the Making of Postwar California. Berkeley, CA: University of California, 2010. Print. The union also became known for its social activism beyond the world of train porters. For many years, Dellums tackled such issues as police brutality and the miserable conditions in which black agricultural workers existed.Reed, Ishmael. Blues City: A Walk in Oakland. New York: Crown Journeys, 2003. Print. Pg 34 Dellums played a leading role in launching the Oakland Voters League (OVL) in the mid-1940s. This labor-civil rights coalition temporarily wrestled control of the Oakland City Council from the conservative Republican bloc that had dominated city politics for many years. Dellums with the OVL, drew their strength from building an organization and a new notion of political community among the city’s multiracial working class. Fair Employment Practices Committee A. Philip Randolph and Dellums were instrumental in opening war industries to African Americans by threatening a massive “March on Washington” if Roosevelt did not respond to black pleas for nondiscriminatory hiring in war industries. In response, Roosevelt issued an executive order establishing a Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC), which urged that defense plants be opened to African Americans.De, Graaf Lawrence Brooks., Kevin Mulroy, and Quintard Taylor. Seeking El Dorado: African Americans in California. Los Angeles: Autry Museum of Western Heritage, 2001. Print. pg 292 Not all labor officials who favored fair employment laws supported putting the FEPC question on the ballot. Dellums opposed placing the question before voters. He later said: > “We should never set a precedent that we recognize that the people have a > right to vote on anything they want to vote on. The rights I have been > fighting for all my life, they are now called civil rights, I call human > rights, God-given rights. White people have been using their majority and > their control of the law enforcing agencies and firearms to prevent us from > exercising our God-given rights…. We were never really asking white people > to grant or give us any rights. Only to stop using their majority and power > in preventing us from exercising our God-given rights.” Dellums would play a leading role in the subsequent fourteen-year effort to win approval of the FEPC measure within the state legislature, and he was eventually appointed by Governor Pat Brown to serve on the state’s first Fair Employment Practices commission in 1960. In 1964, Dellums and the California Fair Employment Practices Commission published “A Report on Oakland Schools” that provided a window into the structural problems within the district as a result of hiring discrimination being one of the biggest obstacles to making the Oakland Unified School District receptive to its growing black student body.Murch, Donna Jean.

It was established in 1959 by the University of Alberta. It is located approximately west of the City of Edmonton, Alberta and north of the town of Devon, Alberta in Parkland County. History The garden was created in 1959 and established on donated land. The garden was originally designated the \\"Botanic Garden and Field Laboratory\\" of the department of botany at the U of A. In the 1970s, after the garden was severely damaged by floods, a donation from the Devonian Foundation, along with funds raised by the Friends of the Garden, helped to repair the damages, create a system of canals and ponds, construct a headquarters building, and purchase more land. In recognition of the donation, the name was changed to the Devonian Botanic Garden. The Friends of the Devonian Botanic Garden was founded in 1971 as a fundraising group to support the aims and objectives of the garden. In conjunction with an enhanced memorandum of understanding signed between the Aga Khan University and the University of Alberta in 2009, the University of Alberta requested the Aga Khan IV to develop an Islamic garden within the grounds. Planning the garden took nearly a decade and construction lasted 18 months. It was designed by the architectural firm Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects. The garden opened to the public in July 2018. Throughout the 2018 season, gardeners completed the planting of over 25,000 new perennials, trees, shrubs, and wetland plants, and add finishing touches on landscaping. The total cost of the Aga Khan Garden was $25 million. The garden is tagged as the \\"most northerly Islamic garden in the world\\". The botanical facility was renamed as the University of Alberta Botanic Garden in 2017. In September 2017, it invested $4.9 million to renovate its front entrance and parking lot. Description A lamp and forest path in the Japanese garden The gardens extend over 30 hectares (80 acres) of 12,000-year-old sand dune shoreline of pre-glacial Lake Edmonton, and include an additional 65 hA (160 acres) of natural areas. It is linked to the North Saskatchewan River via the Parkland County trail and will soon be linked to a 74 km Edmonton Capital Region river valley recreation trail system. Highlights of the garden include the Kurimoto Japanese Garden; a Tropical Showhouse with exotic butterflies; Temperate and Arid Showhouses; extensive alpine, herb, rose, peony, lilac, lily, and primula collections; Native Peoples Garden; trial beds, and much more. The Garden is open to visitors from May through Thanksgiving (Oct. 8), and year-round for adult and children's education programming. It contains a diverse variety of plants, with emphasis on cold-hardy plants that can survive the harsh extremes of a Zone 3 climate. As a unit of the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences, the garden is also a site for research, including plant conservation and diversity. A fully digitized herbarium contains a large collection of bryophyte specimens that is used for research and teaching, as well as horticultural plants grown at the garden. Every June, the Edmonton Opera company plays music in the park for one day during an event dubbed Opera al Fresco.

Piment Fort means \\"hot pepper\\" in French. A revival of the show has been announced as part of TVA's 2016 Winter TV season. Overview The show's concept was to invite three humorists a week and to make them participate in a variety of games which led them to crack jokes and tell funny stories. The show was recorded in front of a live audience (18 years and older, because there were alcoholic drinks served) in Montreal's Café Campus located on 57 Prince-Arthur East. After each game, the audience was asked to vote for the player who made the best joke or story. The winning player received a hot pepper as a trophy. If the vote was close, each player received a pepper. List of games This is a list of games played on the show. Each game was associated with a different hat worn by the host and decorated according to the game's theme. *Les mots croisés (The Crosswords) A crossword game. This game was played once a week and always on Friday. The crossword theme changed each week. The host asked real questions with real answers in order to fill the crossword board, but the players always answered with jokes. A real answer was answered once in the show history. *Trouvez le mozus (Find the Schmuck) *Ça rime en crime (It Rhymes a lot) *Ils vont tellement bien ensemble (They go together really well) Each player was asked to choose a famous person from a selected list and to choose six words from a second different list. Then the player had to explain how the words he/she chose were linked to that person. *Conférence de presse (Press conference) This is not really a game. People in the attendance are asked to ask personal questions to the players. *Les faux proverbes (The fake proverbs) The host gives the first words of a fictitious proverb. Each player has to finish the proverb with his/her own words. *C'est quoi ton sigle? The host asks the meaning of a real abbreviation or acronym, but each player has his/her own interpretation. *Qu'avez-vous à déclarer? (What do you have to declare?) *Les béatitudes The host asks the player to finish a sentence beginning with: \\"Bless (a famous person or a group of famous people)...\\" *Au pied de la lettre Each player is assigned with a different statement. The players have to read their statement, but they have to change a selected letter by another one. Example: change the \\"b\\" for \\"z.\\" Each player has 30 seconds to read their statement. *Devine la devise (Find the motto) *Place aux poètes (Here are the poets) *Vive la différence! (Long live the difference!) The host asks the players what is the difference between two famous people. *C'est meilleur en groupe (It's better in a group) *À quoi tu penses? (What do you think?) *Les pieds dans les plats *Ça rend sourd A different sound is assigned to each humorist. They have to tell what it does mean. *Mission impossible *Fais ta prière *Comme maman disait (As mommy said) *On va-tu aux vues? *Y ont l'tour *L'avenir dans mes boules *J'ai mon voyage The host gives a fictitious scenario: a famous person has gone to a selected place. Each player has to imagine what this person did there. *Avec des si... (With ifs...) The host gives the beginning of a sentence which begins itself with the word \\"if.\\" Each player is asked to finish the sentence. *Fais-moi une ligne (Draw me a line) That game is played with a drawing board. Each humorist is shown a different abstract drawing. They all have to finish their drawing their own way and to explain the significance of the final drawing. *C'est qui? C'est qui? (Who is it? Who is it?) A guest star invited to the show is hidden behind a big board. The host gives clues to the players in order to discover the guest's identity. *Les simagrées This is a game based on improvisation. Each player is secretly given a person, an animal or an event by the host. The player has to mime it and the other two players have to guess what the active player wants to tell them. *La grosse légume (The big vegetable) A guest star invited to the show is hidden in a hot pepper costume. The players have to ask questions to the hidden guest in order to discover his/her identity. *Le sac sur la tête (The bag on the head) The game begins as every player has a bag on the head. When it's his/her turn, one player puts off his/her bag and he/she discovers that everybody in the attendance has a bag on their head. There's a guest star hidden in the bag-headed crowd and the player has to put the bag of the head of every person he seeks in order to find the guest. Each player is given limited time and if he/she passes through his/her own time, it's another player turn to try. *Le détecteur de mensonges (The Lie Detector) *Strip tease *Connais-tu l'histoire du gars (Do you know the guy's story?) The most popular game of the show. Each humorist tells a joke or a hilarious story of his/her choice. *Top secret The host asks the players to tell what they think is the biggest secret kept by a famous person. *Le début de la fin (The beginning of the end) The host gives the beginning and the end of a fictitious story. Each part is completely different from the other. Player 1 has to tell the story by saying the beginning words already given and to go on with his/her own ideas during a given time. Then, player 2 has to pursue the story where player 1 left off. Player 3 pursues second player's part and has to end the story with the words given by the host before the game started.

The sailor is \\"paid off at the Home\\" and meets Maggie \\"cruising up and down\\" the square. In one version of the lyrics she is wearing a \\"crin-o-line\\", the bell-shaped dress worn by the woman in the foreground. \\"Maggie May\\" (or \\"Maggie Mae\\") (Roud 1757) is a traditional Liverpool folk song about a prostitute who robbed a \\"homeward bounder\\": a sailor coming home from a round trip. John Manifold, in his Penguin Australian Song Book, described it as \\"A foc'sle song of Liverpool origin apparently, but immensely popular among seamen all over the world\\". It became widely circulated in a skiffle version from the late 1950s. In 1964, the composer and lyricist Lionel Bart (the creator of the musical Oliver!), used the song and its backstory as the basis of a musical set around the Liverpool Docks. The show, also called Maggie May, ran for two years in London. In 1970, a truncated version of the song performed by the Beatles was included on their album Let It Be. Lyrics As with most folk songs, the lyrics exist in many variant forms. The song specifies several real streets in Liverpool, notably Lime Street in the centre of the city. The Beatles' version, arranged by John Lennon / Paul McCartney / George Harrison / Richard Starkey, is as follows: > Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away And she never walk down Lime > Street any more Oh the judge he guilty found her For robbing a homeward > bounder That dirty no good robbin' Maggie Mae To the port of Liverpool They > returned me to Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay. In the most established version, it is sung in the first person by a sailor who has come home to Liverpool from Sierra Leone. He is paid off for the trip. With his wages in his pocket, he sees Maggie \\"cruising up and down old Canning Place\\". She had \\"a figure so divine\\" (either \\"like a frigate of the line\\" or with \\"a voice so refined\\"). He picks her up and she takes him home to her lodgings. When he awakes the following morning, she has taken all his money and even his clothes, insisting that they are in \\"Kelly's locker\\", a pawn shop. When he fails to find his clothes in the pawn shop, he contacts the police. She is found guilty of theft and sentenced to transportation to Botany Bay. While the most famous version of the chorus contains the line \\"she'll never walk down Lime Street any more\\", Stan Hugill in his Shanties from the Seven Seas writes that in different versions several streets are named, referring to different historical red light areas of Liverpool, including Paradise Street, Peter Street and Park Lane.Stan Hugill, Shanties from the Seven Seas: Shipboard Work Songs and Songs Used as Work Songs from the Great Days of Sail, Routledge, 1979, pp.404-6. History Origins British sea music historian Stan Hugill writes of an early reference to the song in the diary of Charles Picknell, a sailor on the female-convict ship Kains that sailed to Van Diemen's Land in 1830. This indicates that versions of the song date back to the actual period of penal transportation mentioned in the lyrics as Maggie's fate. In the earliest known version, the protagonist is \\"charming Nellie Ray\\", who may have been a real transported prostitute and thief. The chorus is \\"Oh! my charming Nellie Ray, They have taken you away, You have gone to Van Dieman's cruel shore: For you've skinned so many tailors, And you've robbed so many sailors, That we'll look for you in Peter Street no more.\\"Charles Picknell, Thrasycles Clarke, The Kains, female convict vessel, Sullivans Cove, 1989, p.40. The historical relation of the song to the 1856 American slave song \\"Darling Nellie Gray\\" published as the work of Benjamin Hanby is unclear. The tune is very similar and the chorus of Hanby's song contains the lines \\"Oh, my darling Nellie Gray, they have taken you away, I'll never see my darling anymore.\\" It's possible that Hanby's tune was adopted to the existing words.Mainly Norfolk: English Folk and Other Good Music The same tune is used for the Geordie song \\"Keep yor feet still Geordie hinny\\" to words by Joe Wilson.Bob Coltman, Paul Clayton and the folksong revival, Scarecrow Press, 2008, p.60. Recordings \\"Maggie May\\" was widely performed in the late 1950s, and was adapted to the skiffle craze of the era. In this period Lime Street was established as her favoured haunt. A. L. Lloyd recorded it in 1956 on the album English Drinking Songs, describing it in the liner notes as \\"last fling of sailor balladry. It is a song that has found its way into every ship but none of the songbooks.\\" Liz Winters and Bob Cort released a skiffle version in 1957.The Billboard, 2 Sep 1957, p. 57. The Vipers Skiffle Group also released a version in that year.James E. Perone, Mods, Rockers, and the Music of the British Invasion, ABC-CLIO, 2009, p.9.The Billboard, 29 April 1957, p. 56. This became the best-known recording at the time, but it was banned by BBC Radio on its release because of the sexual content of the lyrics.Dominic Strinati, Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain, Routledge, 1992, p.305. Stan Kelly also sang a version on his 1958 EP Liverpool Packet. The Lionel Bart version in the 1964 musical uses the traditional tune, but changes the lyrics somewhat. It is sung in the third person and Maggie is transformed into a heroine whose departure from the streets is lamented (\\"some rotten Homeward Bounder has got his grip around her\\"). This version was performed by Kenneth Haigh in the original cast recording of the musical. The Bart version was regularly sung by Judy Garland, and was recorded by her on the Maggie May EP in 1964.Adrian Wright, A Tanner's Worth of Tune: Rediscovering the Post-War British Musical, Boydell & Brewer, 2010, p.244-5. The Beatles are known to have seen and discussed the Bart musical.Tony Barrow, John, Paul, George, Ringo And Me: The Real Beatles Story, Da Capo Press, 2005, p.83. The song was also recorded by The Searchers and by Hughie Jones of The Spinners (Jones later claimed that the real Maggie May lived in Duke Street and died in 1952).BBC Maggie May, 2002 It was also recorded in several albums of sea shanties, by Cyril Tawney, Bob Roberts and others. The Beatles' version A brief extract was performed by the Beatles in a joking manner during their Get Back sessions, in early 1969, at a point in the proceedings when they were warming up in the studio by playing old rock and roll and skiffle songs that they had known and played in their teenage years. They adopt heavy scouse accents for the performance. Though the performance was obviously tongue-in-cheek, a truncated version of it was included on the 1970 album drawn from those sessions, Let It Be, appearing as the last track on the LP's first side, immediately after the title song. The version they performed was spelled \\"Maggie Mae\\" on the track listing and all four Beatles were credited as arrangers of the traditional song, thus allowing them to collect the writers' share of the publishing income for this public domain song. At 39 seconds long, it is the second-shortest song released on an official Beatles album (the shortest being \\"Her Majesty\\", at 23 seconds). It was also the first song recorded by the group, not originally written by any member, to appear on an album since \\"Act Naturally\\" was recorded in June, 1965 as the last recorded song for the group's album Help!. This song and \\"Dig It\\" appear on the Let It Be album, but are not included on the Let It Be... Naked album. Let It Be... Naked did include \\"Maggie Mae\\" on the bonus disc, \\"Fly on the Wall\\" at 17 minutes and 30 seconds. This extends beyond the 39 seconds included on the original Let it Be and segues at 54 seconds into \\"I Fancy Me Chances\\" as McCartney sings \\"Take it Maggie...oh, I fancy me chances with you\\". The song had been a staple of the repertoire of the Quarrymen, the skiffle group formed by Lennon that evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Lennon was still making home recordings of the song shortly before his death in 1980. These instances demonstrate an important personal connection to the song for Lennon and may have contributed to the snippet being included on the album Let It Be.Michael Murphy, Deryn Rees-Jones, Writing Liverpool: Essays and Interviews, Liverpool University Press, 2007, p.241. The song appears twice in the 2010 biopic Nowhere Boy. First, it is played for a teenage John Lennon by his mother, Julia, and he then learns to play it himself, both on the four- string banjo. Later in the film the song is shown as the first one played by Lennon's band The Quarrymen, though this was not in fact their first public appearance. pp 57-61 A performance by the cast (as \\"The Nowhere Boys\\") appears on the film's soundtrack album. The song is sung in the 2017 film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, by a character named Uncle Jack, portrayed by Paul McCartney.

He began by playing cello and eventually moved to bass, bajo sexto, and other stringed instruments. While in Mexico, Cenobio's father, Don Cenobio, taught his children the fine art of music, providing to them a rigorous musical education. Cenobio Hernández was heavily active in the late 1920s performing in orchestras in the silent film industry. After moving away from Mexico, he settled in San Antonio, Texas and performed at the Majestic, the Empire, and the Palace theaters in San Antonio, Texas at the turn-of-the-century. In 1927, when the silent film industry moved into the \\"talking film\\" industry, Cenobio Hernández began to focus his time on composing music. Although he did not play piano, Cenobio wrote several compositions for piano. He wrote many upbeat polkas, marked with trance-like, hypnotic harmonies (chordal structures) and careful, elegant melodies (marked with unexpected movements and unique transitions). Inspired in an instant, Cenobio would use a pencil to write ideas on paper bags and other everyday materials, hand-drawing the staff lines, the harmony, and then the melody. The music of Cenobio Hernandez, although not well known, has been featured in some of the least expected instances.

Lackey is now extinct as the properties were bought by the federal government in 1918 for use as a naval military installation. History Evidence from an oral history study suggests there was a small free people of color community in this area before the Civil War. Free African American families were established primarily by unions between white slave owners and African or African-American women during the colonial period, when the working class lived and worked together. From 1860 to 1870, the black population in York County doubled, due to slaves escaping to Union lines. The total population in the county was majority black, with a portion having gained freedom before the war. After the war, a number of freedmen remained, settling in and near what became called \\"the reservation\\" and then Lackey, along the Yorktown-Williamsburg Road. Several hundred African-American families lived here by the turn of the 20th century. They worked in farming and/or (and sometimes both) as fishermen and oystermen in the local waters.Bradley M. McDonald, Kenneth E. Stuck, and Kathleen J. Bragdon, \\"Cast Down Your Bucket Where You Are\\": An Ethnohistorical Study of the African-American Community on the Lands of the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station, 1865–1918, 1992. William and Mary College Occasional Papers in Archaeology, pp. 10-12, full text online at Hathi Trust During World War I, the properties of many primarily African-American landowners along the former Yorktown-Williamsburg Road were taken to create a military reservation now known as Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. Oral histories indicate that as many as 60 African-American families were displaced by the Navy, and many of these were said to own their land. Three churches also had to vacate the desired land. Assisted by self-educated farmer John Tack Roberts (born approximately 1860), who studied law and became a magistrate, many of the displaced residents of Lackey were able to obtain financial compensation from the government for their property. A number relocated to the community of Grove in nearby James City County. Others moved to Williamsburg, or Lee Hall. Many were unable to buy comparable areas with their compensation, and turned from farming to other trades. Another small community, also named Lackey, was later developed along the Yorktown Road a few miles away. However, the original Lackey is now considered extinct and one of the many lost towns of Virginia. Further reading *McCartney, Martha W.

It is located in the northeast part of the city, about two blocks north of the Arlington/Marin Circle, and straddles Indian Rock Avenue. The central feature of the park is a large rock outcropping on the west side of Indian Rock Ave. The larger portion of the park, on the opposite side of the street, has several much smaller rock outcroppings, grass fields, and a small barbecue and picnic area. The rock is composed of Northbrae rhyolite. History and description The land for Indian Rock Park was donated to the City of Berkeley by Duncan McDuffie, a real estate mogul, Sierra Club president and mountaineer, during Mason McDuffie's development of the Northbrae area. It was dedicated for park purposes in 1917. Indian Rock has long been used as a practice site for serious rock climbing, particularly bouldering. Members of the Sierra Club began climbing there regularly on weekends at least as early as the 1950s. Dick Leonard, the “father of modern rock climbing,” and noted environmentalist David Brower, founder of Friends of the Earth, learned rock climbing and developed their mountaineering techniques at Indian Rock. Brower used this special knowledge to prepare training manuals during World War II, which proved critical in enabling the 86th Regiment of the U.S. Army to surprise the Germans at Riva Ridge in the North Appennines in Italy, the major action disrupting German lines in southern Europe. The top of the main outcropping, Indian Rock, has views that encompass sights from downtown Oakland and the University of California, Berkeley campus to the south; central Berkeley, San Francisco Bay, and San Francisco to the west; and Marin County and Richmond, California to the northwest and north. All three of the bay's largest bridges can be seen from the rock. Volcanic in origin, Indian Rock is the largest of a number of similar rhyolite rock formations in the vicinity, including the smaller rocks in the portion of the park on the east side of Indian Rock Ave. For example, only one block farther up the east side of Indian Rock Ave. is the Mortar Rock Park, which has its own complex of granite outcroppings. Many remains of acorn-grinding pits carved into solid rock can be found in all these outcroppings, especially the aptly named Mortar Rock. These pits were made by the local indigenous people, the Huichin band of the Ohlones. Indian Rock Path, a public walkway, connects the park to the intersection of Solano Avenue and The Alameda. The main part of Indian Rock itself has two sets of steps leading to its summit that were carved into the rock during the Depression years. Indian Rock Park has been featured in the New York Times on at least two occasions in 2010 and 2018.

The venue is located at Quay Park, Parnell, very close to Britomart Transport Centre and The Strand Station. The arena cost approximately $94 million, and of this sum ratepayers contributed $68 million for the facility to be managed by QPAM, the NZ operator, in New Zealand's first big public-private partnership.

On 19 April 2017, Spark New Zealand took over the naming rights, renaming the venue Spark Arena. Ownership Quay Park Arena Management Ltd was incorporated in 2002 to construct and operate the stadium, in a deal between the company's owners and the then Auckland City Council. In 2005, the company was renamed QPAM Ltd. QPAM has ultimately been owned by EVENZ Limited since 2012.

The Arena hosted two more Breakers games during the season, against the Townsville Crocodiles in Round 8 (24 November) and the Kings in Round 17 (27 January 2012). That first NBL game at Vector Arena drew a New Zealand record crowd for a basketball game when 6,900 saw the NZ Breakers defeat the Kings 76-59. This record was again broken in Round 17 of the 2011-12 season when 7,979 saw the Breakers again defeat the Kings 93-64. On 13 March 2012 New Zealand Breakers General Manager Richard Clarke announced that due to the amount of support for the team (which is more than double the capacity of their regular home venue, the 4,400 seat North Shore Events Centre), that all Breakers finals games would be played at Vector Arena with capacity set at 8,500, subject to demand, with extra seating to be sold if needed. The Breakers finished the 2011-12 season as minor premiers giving them home court advantage in the Semi-finals and Grand Final (if they qualified). The Breakers qualified for the 2011-12 NBL Grand Final against the Perth Wildcats with games 1 and 3 being played at Vector. Game 1 saw the attendance record broken when 9,125 showed to see the Breakers win 104-98 in overtime.

Daniel Heilicher and his brother Amos started in a business together in the 1930s, distributing and stocking jukeboxes. In 1954, they founded Soma Records (\\"Amos\\" backwards), and started producing records in cooperation with Vernon Bank, owner of Kay Bank Studios.The Soma Records Story spikemagazine.com. Retrieved: April 15, 2014. Eventually a number of huge hits would come out of their efforts at the studio, including the Fendermen's \\"Muleskinner Blues\\", Dave Dudley's \\"Six Days on the Road\\", the Trashmen's \\"Surfin' Bird\\", and The Castaways' \\"Liar, Liar\\". Those last two singles were hits from Minneapolis's golden, mid-1960s era of teenage rock, and their success inspired countless garage bands to entertain dreams of one-hit- wonderdom. Among those who traveled to Minneapolis to record were Bobby Vee's band the Shadows (\\"Susie Baby\\"), and Chad Allan and the Reflections (later the Expressions, who became The Guess Who), who recorded \\"Shakin' All Over\\". The principle record labels who used Kay Bank services for recording, pressing and distribution: Applause, Bangar, Garrett, Golden Wing, Kay Bee, Lodestar, North Star, Pleasant Peasant, Re-Car, Soma, Studio City and Twin Town. Kay Bank employed a matrix starting with the letters KB followed by a 2,3, or 4 digit number. In the year 1960, Capitol records used the letters kb (lowercase) for their custom records division. These can be identified by the dash between the letters and numbers, which Kay Bank does not have. Beginning in December 1964, the matrix dropped the KB letters in favor of the year of production followed by a dash and a four digit number, such as 5-5477. This can be interpreted as the 5477th record produced by Kay Bank, in the year 1965. In the 1980s, the Nicollet Avenue building would become the headquarters of influential independent record label Twin/Tone Records. In 2015 the historic recording studio was incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit by Eliot Skinner.

It was created by a split of area code 415 on March 1, 1959. It serves part of the northern San Francisco Bay Area, as well as the North Coast. Major cities in the area code include Napa, Sebastopol, Vallejo, Benicia, Fairfield, Santa Rosa, Windsor, Healdsburg, Rohnert Park, Petaluma, Fort Bragg, Crescent City, Eureka, Clearlake, Vacaville, Ukiah, and northwestern California. History When the North American Numbering Plan was created by AT&T; in 1947, the far northern part of California received area code 916, with the exclusion of the city of Sacramento, which used area code 415. California area codes were reorganized geographically in 1950, so that 916 was assigned to a numbering plan area that comprised only the northeastern part from the Sierra Nevada to the Central Valley. The coastal area to the west was assigned area code 415. With this change, Sacramento was also changed to area code 916. On March 1, 1959, numbering plan area 415 was divided in a flash-cut (without permissive dialing period) in which the northern part of the numbering plan area (Solano county and north thereof) received area code 707, which was California's eighth area code (along with 213, 415, 916, 714, 408, 805, and 209), and the last new area code in the state until 619 was added in 1982. It is not only the only one of these area codes never to have required relief, but it is also the only one of California's thirteen original-format area codes (i.e., area codes with a 0 or 1 as their middle digit, the others being 310, 510, 818 and 909, all of which, in addition to 619, were introduced decades after 707's debut) not to require relief from a \\"new format\\" area code (those with 2–8 as their middle digit, which were introduced beginning in 1995 when the NANP ran out of the original format NPAs), despite explosive growth in the area, particularly its southern portion, as well as the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. When area code 530 was split from area code 916 on November 1, 1997, the Dixon area was renumbered from area code 916 to 707 and switched from the Sacramento local access and transport area (LATA) into the San Francisco LATA. In 1999, a three-way, two-phase split of the area code 707 was scheduled by Pacific Bell, such that a new area code (627) would have served most of Napa and Sonoma Counties and small portions of Marin and Mendocino Counties, while another new area code (369) would have served Solano County, as well as a small portion of Napa County, beginning in December 2000 and October 2001, respectively. However, due to the success of number pooling in preserving numbering resource, the California Public Utilities Commission cancelled these actions on July 27, 2000. From projections in 2018 and the first quarter of 2020, area code 707 is expected to need area code relief not earlier than mid-2025.https://nationalnanpa.com/reports/2018-2_NPA_Exhaust_Projections_Final.pdf Service area Del Norte County *Bertsch-Oceanview *Crescent City *Crescent City North *Fort Dick *Gasquet *Hiouchi *Klamath *Northcrest *Pelican Bay State Prison *Smith River Humboldt County *Alderpoint *Alton *Arcata *Bayside *Bayview *Blocksburg *Blue Lake *Bridgeville *Carlotta *Cutten *Eureka *Fernbridge *Ferndale *Fieldbrook *Fields Landing *Fortuna *Garberville *Honeydew *Humboldt Hill *Hydesville *Loleta *Kneeland *Korbel *Mad River *Manila *McKinleyville *Miranda *Myers Flat *Myrtletown *Orick *Pepperwood *Petrolia *Phillipsville *Pine Hills *Redcrest *Redway *Rio Dell *Samoa *Scotia *Shelter Cove *Trinidad *Weott *Westhaven-Moonstone *Willow Creek *Whitethorn Lake County *City of Clearlake *Clearlake Oaks *Clearlake Park *Clearlake Rivieras *Cobb *Finley *Glenhaven *Hidden Valley Lake *Kelseyville *Lake Pillsbury *Lakeport *Loch Lomond *Lower Lake *Lucerne *Middletown *Nice *North Lakeport *Sulphur Bank Rancheria *Upper Lake *Whispering Pines *Witter Springs Marin County *Dillon Beach *Fallon *Tomales Mendocino County *Albion *Boonville *Branscomb *Calpella *Caspar *Cleone *Comptche *Covelo *Dos Rios *Elk *Fort Bragg *Gualala *Hopland *Inglenook *Keene Summit *Laytonville *Leggett *Little River *Manchester *Mendocino *Navarro *Noyo *Philo *Piercy *Point Arena *Potter Valley *Pudding Creek *Redwood Lodge *Redwood Valley *Rockport *Sherwood Valley Rancheria *Talmage *Ukiah *Westport *Willits *Yorkville Napa County *Aetna Springs *American Canyon *Angwin *Calistoga *Circle Oaks *Deer Park *Napa *Oakville *Pope Valley *Rutherford *Spanish Flat *St. Helena *Vichy Springs *Yountville *Zinfandel Solano County *Benicia *Birds Landing *Collinsville *Dixon *Elmira *Fairfield *Green Valley *Liberty Farms *Rio Vista *Suisun City *Travis AFB *Vacaville *Vallejo Sonoma County *Asti *Bloomfield *Bodega Bay *Bodega *Boyes Hot Springs *Camp Meeker *Carmet *Cazadero *Cloverdale *Cotati *Duncans Mills *El Verano *Eldridge *Fetters Hot Springs-Agua Caliente *Forestville *Fort Ross *Fulton *Freestone *Geyserville *Glen Ellen *Graton *Guerneville *Guernewood Park *Healdsburg *Jenner *Kenwood *Korbel *Lakeville *Larkfield-Wikiup *Mark West Springs *Mark West *Monte Rio *Occidental *Penngrove *Petaluma *Rio Dell *Rio Nido *Rohnert Park *Roseland *Salmon Creek *Santa Rosa *Schellville *Sea Ranch *Sebastopol *Sonoma *Stewarts Point *Temelec *Two Rock *Valley Ford *Villa Grande *Vineburg *Windsor Trinity County *Ruth *Zenia See also *List of California area codes References External links * 707 707 707 707 707 707 707 707 707 707 Category:1959 establishments in California ","title":"Area code 707"},{"id":"4232547","text":"Lipník nad Bečvou (; ) is a town in Přerov District in the Olomouc Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 8,000 inhabitants. The historic centre of Lipník nad Bečvou is well preserved and historically significant and is protected by law as urban monument reservation. Geography Lipník nad Bečvou lies on the north bank of the Bečva river, and within the Moravská Brána, the Moravian Gate, a depression between the Oderské vrchy and the Western Carpathians allowing a low-lying route from the Polish plains. For several centuries, Lipník nad Bečvou was an important waypoint on the Amber Road which passes through the Moravian Gate. The nearest larger towns are Přerov and Hranice, approximately 10–12 km (6–8 mi) distant. About 2 km to the south, on the south side of the valley, lies the village of Týn nad Bečvou, and above it the castle Helfštýn, which has played a substantial part in the town's history. Sights Lipník nad Bečvou is an ancient town with a large square (T. G. Masaryk Square) in the shape of the letter L and an interesting set of sights. It was a fortified town, and it still retains a large portion of its medieval walls and towers. There is a ring road that runs around the outside of the ancient walls, with the best view of the walls to be seen from Komenský Park. The town may be proud of the well-established historical centre with a Renaissance town hall, baroque fountains and Renaissance houses with arcades. A varying population of modern iron sculptures is displayed in the square and elsewhere around town reflecting the annual Hefaiston blacksmithing festival held at Helfštýn each August. Just next to the square, St. James' Parish Church with its unique belltower offers a fine view of the square. The church itself is built in a Baroque style and is highly ornamented inside. In addition, there is a Renaissance palace with a walled garden in the rear, a Piarist monastery with the St. Francis' Serafin Church, where Gregor Mendel briefly studied, and a synagogue, the second oldest surviving in the Czech Republic. A large Jewish minority lived here; two unique Jewish cemeteries are the evidence of this. Transport The town has a station on the mainline railway from Prague to Ostrava, but is served mainly by local services to Přerov, Hranice and Valašské Meziříčí. A motorway bypasses the town a short distance to the north, being the D35 to the west of the town, leading to Olomouc, and the D1 to the east, leading to Ostrava. The town also lies on the Kraków–Moravia–Vienna Greenway, a long distance cycling route.

The term literally means “books written in kana” (kana being the phonetic Japanese syllabary that is simpler to read and write than kanji, or Chinese ideographs). The designation thus derives from the fact that the text of these books was written either entirely in kana or in a mixture of kana and kanji. Kanazōshi are considered to be a transitional genre, bridging the gap between medieval romances and the first high point of Edo period (1600-1868) literature, the ukiyozōshi composed by Ihara Saikaku (1642–93). The genre comprises an unlikely assortment of essays, stories, travel guides for famous places, military chronicles, religious writings, and critical pieces. Despite the lack of uniformity in content, kanazōshi are classified as a distinct genre primarily based on the fact that they were the first literary works to be printed and widely circulated in Japan. Scholars also maintain that kanazōshi are generally of higher literary quality and more realistic than medieval forms, such as the otogizōshi, that preceded them. Characteristics of Kanazōshi Before the 1620s, the only books available in Japan were handwritten manuscripts. The printed kanazōshi were less expensive and more widely available than these earlier manuscripts. They are thus considered the first example of commercial literature produced in Japan. One should keep in mind, however, the comparatively limited nature of their popularity. The cost of a single volume was still prohibitive, costing roughly the equivalent of what a laborer could earn for two or three days of work (4000 of Japanese currency). Moreover, the books, because of their small print runs (often only a few hundred copies), rarely circulated beyond Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo, the publishing centers in premodern Japan. Illustration from Ukiyo Monogatari, showing patrons visiting the licensed prostitution quarter Despite these limitations, the appearance of these books amounted to an important new trend in literary production. Closely tied to the rise of Japan's urban centers, the growing economic power of the chōnin (urban commoner) class, the improvement of literacy rates, and the advent of woodblock print technology, kanazōshi emerged as a new, distinctly plebeian form of literature. Its authors arose from the educated portion of the population, including scholars, Buddhist priests, courtiers, samurai and rōnin. But its readership consisted mostly of non-aristocratic residents of Japan's growing cities. In contrast to otogizōshi and other forms of medieval Japanese tales, kanazōshi tended to be more realistic, with fewer supernatural or fantastic elements. Whether meant to entertain or inform, kanazōshi narratives conveyed more details about the characters and their setting, contained more natural dialogue, and showcased a more representative slice of life. Although more skillfully written than otogizōshi, kanazōshi are considered less advanced in terms of structure and wordplay than the subsequent ukiyozōshi composed by Saikaku. Reflecting the tastes of their comparatively less sophisticated audience, kanazōshi often relied upon simple puns to generate humor. For instance, the term “hanatare”, which can mean both a runny nose or a drooping flower, is used to describe a young child with the family name of Fujiwara (wisteria field). This type of pun typifies the level of humor found in kanazōshi. Each kanazōshi book consisted of between one and twelve slim volumes of twenty to thirty leaves each, with roughly one-fifth of the space devoted to illustrations. Book prices were principally determined by the number of volumes. Development of Kanazōshi Scholars generally divide kanazōshi into two groups: Early kanazōshi Early kanazōshi were written mainly by the educated classes, including lesser samurai, courtiers, Buddhist priests, and scholars. Because these works were written by highly educated authors, they were often didactic, promoting moral behavior based on the previous generation’s sense of morality. The early kanazōshi are broken down into three categories: works meant to entertain, works meant to intellectually enlighten, and works written to educate people about practical matters. Kanazōshi which were written to entertain include war tales, romances and parodies of earlier classics such as Ise monogatari. Those written to promote intellectual growth mainly deal with reconciling the ideas of Buddhism, Shintoism and Confucianism. The more practical kanazōshi include travel guides, samples of well written love letters, and critiques of famous courtesans and kabuki actors. Late kanazōshi The late kanazōshi are those works which were written in the latter half of the 17th century. Unlike the early kanazōshi, the late kanazōshi were written mostly by commoners for a commoner readership. This shift in the social class of the authors is reflected in the fact that the protagonists in the later works are usually commoners. In addition, the language used in the later kanazōshi is more realistic, and male and female characters speak using structures that are specific to their gender. Many scholars believe that this shift towards realism paved the way for ukiyozōshi, a later genre which is partially defined by its intense realism. Representative Authors Famous kanazōshi writers include Asai Ryōi (d. 1691) and Suzuki Shōsan (1579-1655). Main works include: Nise Monogatari (Tale of Falsehoods: A Parody of Tales of Ise), Shimizu monogatari (Tale of Shimizu), and Tōkaidō meishoki (Famous Sites on the Tokaido Highway). The most celebrated example of the genre is Ryōi’s Ukiyo monogatari (Tales of the Floating World, 1661), a comedic tale about a young man named Hyōtarō who gets himself into all kinds of trouble with gambling, prostitutes, and the like, and then learns valuable lessons about the proper way to live one’s life from town elders.

The battle was the first large-scale employment of Greek troops of the Army of National Defence (Greece had joined united the war in summer 1917) on the front, and resulted in the capture of the heavily fortified Bulgarian positions. The Allied force comprised three Greek divisions of the National Defence Army Corps under Lieutenant General Emmanouil Zymvrakakis, plus one French brigade. The three Greek divisions included the Archipelago Division under Major General Dimitrios Ioannou, the Crete Division under Major General Panagiotis Spiliadis, and the Serres Division under Lieutenant Colonel Epameinondas Zymvrakakis. The 5th and 6th Regiments from the Archipelago Division were in the center, the 7th and 8th Regiments from the Crete Division were on the right flank and the 1st Regiment of the Serres Division was on the left flank. Battle A Bulgarian gun captured by the Allies at Skra Bulgarian prisoners of war Bulgarian soldiers during the battle In the early morning of 29 May 1918, Greek artillery fired on Bulgarian positions in preparation for the next morning's assault. On 06.30, 30 May 1918, Allied forces captured Skra from the heavily outnumbered Bulgarians. Starting from the evening of the same day until May 31, the Bulgarian army launched several counterattacks on positions held by the Crete Division. All attacks were repelled, cementing the Allied victory. In the battle, 441 Allied soldiers were killed, 2,227 wounded and 164 missing in action. Bulgaria suffered 600 soldiers killed and 2045 taken prisoner. 12 artillery pieces and 32 machine guns as well as other equipment were also captured. Aftermath The battle was important for the progress in the Macedonian front, as the Allies after a year of unsuccessful attacks, finally broke the Bulgarian positions.

They were previously called the \\"Contra Costa Range/Hills\\"Reports of Explorations and Surveys for a Railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean...1853-54, Volume 5, p.139-40, United States Army Corps of Engineers, 1856 (from the original Spanish Sierra de la Contra Costa), but with the establishment of Berkeley and the University of California, the current usage was applied by geographers and gazetteers. Geology The Berkeley Hills are bounded by the major Hayward Fault along their western base, and the minor Wildcat fault on their eastern side. The highest peaks are Grizzly Peak (elevation 1,754 feet/535 m) and Round Top (elevation 1,761 feet/537 m), an extinct volcano, and William Rust Summit 1,004 feet (306 m). Vollmer Peak (elevation 1,905 feet/581 m), although commonly thought to be part of the Berkeley Hills is actually located on the adjacent San Pablo Ridge near the point where it meets the Berkeley Hills at the head of Wildcat Canyon. Vollmer Peak was named in honor of the first police chief of the City of Berkeley, August Vollmer. It was formerly known as \\"Bald Peak\\". Development Much of the west slope of the Berkeley Hills has residential neighborhoods of mostly single family homes, except on the land of University of California, Berkeley. Most streets are narrow and tend to follow the contours of the land, although three streets, Marin Avenue, Moeser Lane, and Potrero Avenue, run directly toward the ridgeline. Other roads to the ridgeline wind their way up the canyons. Grizzly Peak and Skyline Boulevards follow the top of the ridge. Many neighborhoods in the south Berkeley hills are home to the more affluent residents of Berkeley and Oakland. The east slope of the Berkeley Hills is mostly preserved or partially developed wildland, much of it owned by the East Bay Regional Park District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). From north to south, the parks are Wildcat Canyon Regional Park, Tilden Regional Park (includes Vollmer and Grizzly Peaks), Sibley Volcanic Regional Park (includes Round Top), Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve, Redwood Regional Park (enfolding Roberts Regional Recreation Area), Anthony Chabot Regional Park, Lake Chabot Regional Park, and Cull Canyon Regional Recreation Area. Claremont Canyon Regional Preserve, and Temescal Regional Park are lower on the western slopes while Las Trampas Regional Wilderness is lower on the eastern slope above Danville. The Berkeley Hills are pierced by several tunnels. Two are aqueducts of EBMUD; the Berkeley Hills Tunnel serves the Antioch–SFO/Millbrae line of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. The four bores of the Caldecott Tunnel carry State Highway 24 between Oakland and Contra Costa County. CA 24 near Orinda. Oakland and the Bay from Grizzly Peak Blvd. Usage It is common to hear the term, \\"Oakland Hills\\" to refer to that section of the Berkeley Hills that runs along the east side of Oakland. As a proper name or recognized toponym, it is technically incorrect. When used on maps, the exact south end of the \\"Berkeley Hills\\" is unclear, but the maps of the USGS show them stretching well south into the northeastern portion of Oakland.Oakland East Quadrangle 1973, USGS Topographic Map It does not, in any case, correspond to any political boundaries, only to a geographic feature (much as \\"San Francisco Bay\\" is not limited to that stretch of the Pacific inlet within the bounds of the City and County of San Francisco). The ridge extends south through Oakland and San Leandro to the drainage of San Leandro Creek called Castro Valley, and geologically, continues southward above the line of the Hayward Fault. In the section above East Oakland to Castro Valley, the ridge appears on most maps as the San Leandro Hills.Las Trampas Ridge Quadrangle 1968, USGS Topographic Map The northern extent of the proper name \\"Berkeley Hills\\" is less indefinite; most maps including those of the USGS apply the name along the entire ridge as it runs continuously right up to the mouth of Wildcat Canyon in Richmond.San Francisco 15-minute Quadrangle 1895, USGS Topographic Map The eastern slopes of the Berkeley Hills lie entirely outside of the city of Berkeley within Contra Costa County. Another common usage is East Bay Hills, but its application to any particular range is unclear. It may refer to all of the ranges east of the Bay, from the Berkeley Hills to the Diablo Range and all the ranges between. Climatic effects The Berkeley Hills affect the local climate by their elevation. The oceanic marine layer, which develops during the summer, bringing fog and low clouds with it, is usually less than 2,000 feet deep and thus is blocked by the range. This produces a \\"fog shadow\\" effect to the east, which is warmer than areas west of the hills. The westerly wind that carries the marine layer through the Golden Gate typically splits its flow as it hits the Berkeley Hills producing a southerly wind from Berkeley northward and a northerly wind in the direction of Oakland. In winter during spells of tule fog inland, a reverse situation occurs, with the fog usually confined to areas east of the hills, although occasionally, the inland fog pours in from the north, around the hills by way of the Carquinez Strait. The Berkeley Hills affect rainfall; when the wind is perpendicular to the hills (southwest wind) during a storm, air is forced to rise, cooling and condensing additional moisture, increasing the precipitation on the western slopes and leaving areas east of the hills drier. Especially cold storms occasionally deposit wet snow on the peaks. In spring and fall, sinking air from aloft combining with inland high pressure periodically sends hot, dry, and gusty winds across the ridges of the Berkeley Hills, posing a fire danger, which in the 20th century produced several wildfires, two of which caused major damage to Berkeley and Oakland.

He was Mayor of Nice, France from 1928 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1965, and the father of Jacques Médecin, who succeeded him as mayor until 1990.  Before the war  He was born in Nice to a respectable family. After studying in Paris, he joined the military and fought in the First World War. In 1914 he was promoted to corporal, then in 1916 to the rank of captain. After the battle of Verdun he was awarded the French Legion of Honour and the Croix de Guerre. Upon his return to Nice in 1919, he briefly practised as a lawyer before entering politics. In 1919, he was elected as a Municipal Councillor, and in 1928, Mayor of Nice. He achieved notoriety when he was allowed to stay as mayor for 34 years. He was elected Councillor General of Sospel (1931), then deputy of the first circumscription of Nice (1932). Politically republican, democratic, independent and moderate, he sat within the left-leaning independents, then moved more to the centre with the local political party he created called “Le Rassemblement des Indépendants” (“The Assembly of Independents”). However, Médecin increasingly moved toward the far right, and joined Jacques Doriot's fascist Parti Populaire Français in 1936. Elected Senator of the Alpes-Maritimes in 1939, he voted with enthusiasm for the giving of full powers to Maréchal Philippe Pétain, whom he wanted to conserve his mandates. But in 1942, he did not support the Italian fascists then in occupation of Nice. In open dispute with the government, he was removed from his mayorship in 1943. He fled to Avignon and then to Annot, but he was arrested in 1944 and incarcerated in Nice. He was moved to Belfort in the same year, where he was able to escape captivity.  After the war  On his return to Nice after the Second World War, he was accused of collaborating with the Vichy Regime, and lost some standing in the municipal elections. However, little by little he got back his former positions, and finally reclaimed the mayor’s seat in 1947. Médecin was a bitter opponent of Gaullism. In 1951 he was elected President of the General Council of the Alpes- Maritimes, and in 1953, he became a candidate for the presidential election. From March 1955 to January 1965, he was designated Secretary of State by Edgar Faure. In the presidential election of 1965 he ferociously opposed Charles de Gaulle. In 1961, he handed over many mandates to his son, Jacques Médecin, who succeeded him as mayor of Nice after his death. He died in office.

Early life Born in Chicago, Illinois to Irish immigrants Timothy and Ellen O’Leary,1910 United States Census, who had 16 children (11 boys). O'Leary worked at age 16 for a clothing company and played on the company's semi-pro baseball team. His talent as a middle infielder and scrappy hitter came to the attention of Charles Comiskey, owner of the Chicago White Sox. Though there is no independent verification, O'Leary reportedly signed briefly with the White Sox, only to have his arm broken from a pitched ball thrown by 'fireballer' and Hall of Famer, Rube Waddell. Major Leagues O'Leary major league debut was on April 14, 1904 with the Tigers. He was Detroit's starting shortstop from 1904–1907 and became a backup shortstop and utility infielder from 1908–1912. In the off-season, O'Leary and teammate Germany Schaefer, known as one of baseball's zaniest characters, worked as a comic vaudeville act. The O'Leary-Schaefer vaudeville act is said to have inspired two Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals: the forgotten 1930 film They Learned About Women, featuring the noted vaudeville act Van and Schenck, and Busby Berkeley's last film, Take Me Out to the Ballgame (1949), with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Not known for his hitting, O'Leary had a career batting average of .226. After finishing his playing career in 1913 with the St. Louis Cardinals, O'Leary was a player-manager in the minor and semi-pro leagues for several years, including in San Francisco, St. Paul, San Antonio, and Chicago, until he was offered a coaching job in 1920 by his close friend, Miller Huggins, manager of the New York Yankees. After a 17-0 victory over the Washington Senators on July 6, 1920, O'Leary was returning to New York in a car driven by Babe Ruth, along with Ruth's wife Helen, rookie outfielder Frank Gleich, and second-string catcher Fred Hofmann. Ruth lost control of the car, and O'Leary was ejected from the vehicle, although he suffered only minor injuries. He coached for the Yankees for 10 years, during which they won six pennants and two World Series, including the great 1927 Yankees team. O'Leary then coached with the Chicago Cubs under Rogers Hornsby, and with the St. Louis Browns. On September 30, 1934, several weeks shy of his 59th birthday, O'Leary was called out of retirement by the Browns. In a pinch-hitting appearance, he singled and scored, becoming both the oldest Major League Baseball player to collect a hit and to score a run. Date of birth During his career, O'Leary claimed to have been born in 1882. However, in 2010, a researcher for the Society for American Baseball Research found him in the 1880 census. His draft record for World War I, which showed that he was born in 1875, was subsequently located. This made him the second oldest major league baseball player to appear in a game, after Satchel Paige.

She is well known for her work with Versace, Dior, and Chanel as a supermodel during the 1990s. Mulder repeatedly was featured on the cover of Vogue and was also a Victoria's Secret model. In the early 2000s she began to speak out about the dark side of the modeling industry and the dangers faced by underage girls and young women.  Early life  Mulder was born in 1970 in Vlaardingen, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands. She was raised in Den Haag and Voorburg. Her father, Ben Mulder, is a tax inspector and her mother, Marijke (née de Jong), is a secretary. Mulder has a younger sister, Saskia, who became an actress after a stint studying economics. In 1985, at age 15, Mulder and her family went on a camping trip in the south of France. She saw an ad for Elite Model Management's \\"Look of the Year\\" contest in a newspaper. Mulder was wearing braces at the time and dismissed the idea of applying. A friend took some photographs she had of her and sent them to Elite without her knowledge. She won the preliminary contest in Amsterdam, and was sent to the finals of the contest, placing second. Mulder soon found herself in high demand for modeling jobs and was signed by Elite Paris. Career By her second year on the runway, Mulder was modeling for Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent, Lanvin, Christian Lacroix, Versace, and Giorgio Armani. In 1991, she made the first of many appearances on the cover of Vogue and also landed a contract with GuessPearson Education (Ed.). (2007). Karen Mulder. Retrieved 6 December 2012, from http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0766477.html . A New York Times article from 1991 described Mulder's relentless schedule at age 21, detailing a typical thirteen hour day packed with obligations to Ralph Lauren, a French film crew, Anna Sui and Giorgio Sant'Angelo. Mulder appeared on the cover of British and Spanish Vogue in 1991 - 1992 and became the face of a Nivea advertising campaign. In 1992, Mulder signed a contract with Victoria's Secret. In 1993 she was featured on the cover of Vogue in January and again in March. Other campaigns she appeared in included Calvin Klein, Claude Montana, Ralph Lauren, Yves Saint-Laurent's Rive Gauche fragrance, as well as Guerlain, Chloé, Revlon, Jacques Fath, Gianfranco Ferré, Gianni Versace, Chanel, and Hervé Léger. Mulder has worked with some of the most well known fashion photographers, including Javier Vallhonrat, Peter Lindbergh, Patrick Demarchelier, Bruce Weber, Helmut Newton, Max Vadukul, Gilles Bensimon, Fabrizio Ferri, Steven Meisel, Irving Penn, Robert Erdmann, and Arthur Elgort. In the mid-1990s, Mulder's off-the-runway career was managed by her then- partner, Jean-Yves Le Fur. In 1995, he collaborated with Hasbro on a Karen Mulder doll, which spurred development of a line of dolls modeled on the supermodels of the time. Le Fur and Mulder also made an infomercial and video. Mulder released a beauty and fashion CD-ROM, in which she presented makeup, beauty, and exercise tips. One of the first issues of Top Model magazine was entirely devoted to Mulder along with an entire issue of Italian Vogue. Her two appearances in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1997 and 1998 and her poses for the Victoria's Secret catalogue increased Mulder's profile. In 1997 she released her own calendar. Mulder went on to share catwalks with models such as Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, and Naomi Campbell. For many years, Mulder was among the ten best-paid models in the world. At one point in her career she was reportedly earning up to £10,000 a day. In 2000, Mulder retired from modeling for several years. She made her acting debut in the French short film A Theft, One Night in 2001. Mulder also pursued music, and released an album which achieved some success in the French charts. In 2004, she worked with Daniel Chenevez of the Niagara group to create the self-titled CD Karen Mulder.  Return to modeling  On 1 July 2007 she returned to the catwalk at the Dior Autumn/Winter 07/08 Couture Collection in Paris, modelling alongside Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Helena Christensen, Amber Valletta, Shalom Harlow, and Stella Tennant. Personal life In 1988, at the age of 18, Mulder married French photographer René Bosne. They later divorced in 1993. Mulder stated that her life changed in 1993 when she was shuttling from airport to airport with almost no time at home. She then met real estate developer Jean-Yves Le Fur in the waiting lounge of a Paris airport. They soon became engaged. The relationship with Le Fur ended in 1997. In 1995, she bought a château in France and set up a programme to provide holidays there for underprivileged children. Mulder gave birth to a daughter, Anna, on 30 October 2006. Mental health challenges On 31 October 2001, Mulder was interviewed on the France 2 show Tout le monde en parle (Everyone is Talking About It) hosted by Thierry Ardisson in front of a live studio audience. During the shows taping, Mulder claimed that various people had tried to rape her, including top executives at her former agency, Elite Model Management, and Prince Albert of Monaco. The producers of the show did not broadcast the interview, and the recording was erased. Her parents blamed her troubles on drugs. Days later, Mulder repeated her allegations, this time to a weekly magazine in an interview conducted in her Paris apartment. Within hours of the interview, her sister Saskia arrived and took her to Villa Montsouris, a psychiatric hospital specializing in such disorders as depression, anxiety, and delirium, where she stayed for five months.Hello magazine, 16 December 2002 The stay reportedly was paid for by Elite models president Gérald Marie, her employer and one of the accused. (It came after the BBC caught Marie on hidden camera trying to give a 15-year-old model £300 for sex, and bragging about Elite Model Look competitors he would sleep with that year.) On 10 December 2002, after suffering for years from chronic depression, Mulder went into a coma after she overdosed on sleeping pills in an apparent suicide attempt.Who2. (January 2011). Karen Mulder Biography. Retrieved 10 December 201 from Who2 Biographies website: http://www.who2.com/bio/karen-mulder She left no note. She was rushed to the American Hospital in Neuilly after neighbors found her passed out on the floor of the Paris apartment on exclusive Avenue Montaigne where she was staying with friends. Mulder's parents flew from the Netherlands to be by her side along with former fiancé Jean-Yves Le Fur. Le Fur was reportedly one of the people who found Mulder unconscious after arriving at the apartment after Mulder had not answered several of his telephone calls. She awoke from her coma the next day. On 1 July 2009, it was reported that Mulder was arrested in Paris for threatening to attack her plastic surgeon.

In fact, the class of valid sentences over finite models is not recursively enumerable (though it is co-recursively enumerable). Trakhtenbrot's theorem implies that Gödel's completeness theorem (that is fundamental to first-order logic) does not hold in the finite case. Also it seems counter-intuitive that being valid over all structures is 'easier' than over just the finite ones. The theorem was first published in 1950: \\"The Impossibility of an Algorithm for the Decidability Problem on Finite Classes\\". Mathematical formulation We follow the formulations as in Theorem :Finite satisfiability is not decidable in first-order logic. :That is, the set { φ  φ is a sentence of first-order logic satisfiable in the finite } is undecidable. Corollary Let σ be a relational vocabulary with one at least binary relation symbol. :The set of σ-sentences valid in all finite structures is not recursively enumerable. Remarks # This implies that Gödel's completeness theorem fails in the finite since completeness implies recursive enumerability. # It follows that there is no recursive function f such that: if φ has a finite model, then it has a model of size at most f(φ). In other words, there is no effective analogue to the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem in the finite. Intuitive proof This proof is taken from Chapter 10, section 4, 5 of Mathematical Logic by H.-D. Ebbinghaus. As in the most common proof of Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem through using the undecidability of the halting problem, for each Turing machine M there is a corresponding arithmetical sentence \\\\phi_M, effectively derivable from M, such that it is true if and only if M halts on the empty tape. Intuitively, \\\\phi_M asserts \\"there exists a natural number that is the Gödel code for the computation record of M on the empty tape that ends with halting\\". If the machine M does halt in finite steps, then the complete computation record is also finite, then there is a finite initial segment of the natural numbers such that the arithmetical sentence \\\\phi_M is also true on this initial segment. Intuitively, this is because in this case, proving \\\\phi_M requires the arithmetic properties of only finitely many numbers. If the machine M does not halt in finite steps, then \\\\phi_M is false in any finite model, since there's no finite computation record of M that ends with halting. Thus, if M halts, \\\\phi_M is true in some finite models. If M does not halt, \\\\phi_M is false in all finite models. So, M does not halt if and only if eg\\\\phi_M is true over all finite models. The set of machines that does not halt is not recursively enumerable, so the set of valid sentences over finite models is not recursively enumerable. Alternative proof In this section we exhibit a more rigorous proof from Libkin. Note in the above statement that the corollary also entails the theorem, and this is the direction we prove here. Theorem :For every relational vocabulary τ with at least one binary relation symbol, it is undecidable whether a sentence φ of vocabulary τ is finitely satisfiable. Proof According to the previous lemma, we can in fact use finitely many binary relation symbols. The idea of the proof is similar to the proof of Fagin's theorem, and we encode Turing machines in first-order logic. What we want to prove is that for every Turing machine M we construct a sentence φM of vocabulary τ such that φM is finitely satisfiable if and only if M halts on the empty input, which is equivalent to the halting problem and therefore undecidable. Let M= ⟨Q, Σ, δ, q0, Qa, Qr⟩ be a deterministic Turing machine with a single infinite tape. * Q is the set of states, * Σ is the input alphabet, * Δ is the tape alphabet, * δ is the transition function, * q0 is the initial state, * Qa and Qr are the sets of accepting and rejecting states. Since we are dealing with the problem of halting on an empty input we may assume w.l.o.g. that Δ={0,1} and that 0 represents a blank, while 1 represents some tape symbol. We define τ so that we can represent computations: : τ := {<, _min_ , T0 (⋅,⋅), T1 (⋅,⋅), (Hq(⋅,⋅))(q ∈ Q)} Where: * < is a linear order and _min_ is a constant symbol for the minimal element with respect to < (our finite domain will be associated with an initial segment of the natural numbers). * T0 and T1 are tape predicates. Ti(s,t) indicates that position s at time t contains i, where i ∈ {0,1}. * Hq's are head predicates. Hq(s,t) indicates that at time t the machine is in state q, and its head is in position s. The sentence φM states that (i) <, _min_ , Ti's and Hq's are interpreted as above and (ii) that the machine eventually halts. The halting condition is equivalent to saying that Hq∗(s, t) holds for some s, t and q∗ ∈ Qa ∪ Qr and after that state, the configuration of the machine does not change. Configurations of a halting machine (the nonhalting is not finite) can be represented as a τ (finite) sentence (more precisely, a finite τ-structure which satisfies the sentence). The sentence φM is: φ ≡ α ∧ β ∧ γ ∧ η ∧ ζ ∧ θ. We break it down by components: * α states that < is a linear order and that _min_ is its minimal element * γ defines the initial configuration of M: it is in state q0, the head is in the first position and the tape contains only zeros: γ ≡ Hq0( _min_ , _min_ ) ∧ ∀s T0 (s, _min_ ) * η states that in every configuration of M, each tape cell contains exactly one element of Δ: ∀s∀t(T0(s, t) → ¬ T1(s, t)) * β imposes a basic consistency condition on the predicates Hq's: at any time the machine is in exactly one state: : \\\\forall t \\\\exists ! s (\\\\bigvee_{q\\\\in Q} H_q (s,t))\\\\land eg\\\\exists s \\\\exists t (\\\\bigvee_{q,q'\\\\in Q, q eq q} H_q(s,t)\\\\land H_{q'} (s,t)) * ζ states that at some point M is in a halting state: : \\\\exists s \\\\exists t \\\\bigvee_{q\\\\in Q_a\\\\cup Q_r} H_q (s,t) * θ consists of a conjunction of sentences stating that Ti's and Hq's are well behaved with respect to the transitions of M. As an example, let δ(q,0)=(q',1, left) meanining that if M is in state q reading 0, then it writes 1, moves the head one position to the left and goes into the state q'. We represent this condition by the disjunction of θ0 and θ1: : \\\\theta_0 \\\\equiv \\\\forall s \\\\forall t (s eq \\\\underline{min} \\\\land T_0(s,t) \\\\land H_q (s, t)) \\\\to \\\\theta_2 Where θ2 is: : T_1 (s, t+1)\\\\land H_{q'} (s-1, t+1)\\\\land \\\\forall s' (s eq s' \\\\to (\\\\bigwedge_{i=0,1} T_i (s', t+1)\\\\leftrightarrow T_i(s',t))) And: : \\\\theta_1 \\\\equiv \\\\forall s \\\\forall t (s = \\\\underline{min} \\\\land T_0(s,t) \\\\land H_q (s, t)) \\\\to \\\\theta_3 Where θ3 is: T_1 (s, t+1)\\\\land H_{q'} (s, t+1)\\\\land \\\\forall s' (s eq s' \\\\to (\\\\bigwedge_{i=0,1} T_i (s', t+1)\\\\leftrightarrow T_i(s',t))) s-1 and t+1 are first-order definable abbreviations for the predecessor and successor according to the ordering <. The sentence θ0 assures that the tape content in position s changes from 0 to 1, the state changes from q to q', the rest of the tape remains the same and that the head moves to s-1 (i. e. one position to the left), assuming s is not the first position in the tape. If it is, then all is handled by θ1: everything is the same, except the head does not move to the left but stays put. If φM has a finite model, then such a model that represents a computation of M (that starts with the empty tape (i.e. tape containing all zeros) and ends in a halting state). If M halts on the empty input, then the set of all configurations of the halting computations of M (coded with <, Ti's and Hq's) is a model of φM, which is finite, since the set of all configurations of halting computations is finite. It follows that M halts on the empty input iff φM has a finite model. Since halting on the empty input is undecidable, so is the question of whether φM has a finite model \\\\mathcal{A} (equivalently, whether φM is finitely satisfiable) is also undecidable (recursively enumerable, but not recursive). This concludes the proof. Corollary : The set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursively enumerable. Proof Enumerate all pairs (\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\phi) where \\\\mathcal{A} is finite and \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\models \\\\phi. Corollary : For any vocabulary containing at least one binary relation symbol, the set of all finitely valid sentences is not recursively enumerable. Proof From the previous lemma, the set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursively enumerable. Assume that the set of all finitely valid sentences is recursively enumerable. Since ¬φ is finitely valid iff φ is not finitely satisfiable, we conclude that the set of sentences which are not finitely satisfiable is recursively enumerable. If both a set A and its complement are recursively enumerable, then A is recursive. It follows that the set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursive, which contradicts Trakhtenbrot's theorem.

He rose to prominence in 2003, when he was the protagonist of The Joe Schmo Show, a fake reality show in which, unbeknownst to him, all the participants but Gould were actors portraying broad reality show participant archetypes. Background Gould is a native of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1999 with a degree in speech communications. Gould attended the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, but dropped out prior to completion. After dropping out, Gould began living with his parents and working as a pizza delivery man. The Joe Schmo Show Gould was playing basketball with friends at a Jewish Community Center in the South Hills section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania when a casting director for SpikeTV's The Joe Schmo Show spotted him. Gould auditioned for the show, and was selected as its protagonist. As far as Gould was concerned, he was competing in the reality show Lap of Luxury for a $100,000 prize to be awarded to the winner. At the end of each show, one of the show's actors-contestants was evicted. Halfway through the season, an older contestant with whom Gould had bonded was \\"voted\\" off the show, causing Gould to break down and begin questioning whether voting off friends was worth monetary gain. Matters were complicated the following day when Gould accidentally injured one of the actors, Kristen Wiig, later of Saturday Night Live fame, in a sumo wrestling contest. Upon Wiig's return to the show, Gould insisted on giving the sumo wrestling contest's prize (a vacation package) to Wiig. Gould's acts of vulnerability in the former instance, and generosity in the latter, caused the producers to shift the show's focus and tone significantly away from mockery and towards praise. The truth was revealed to Gould in the season's finale, which garnered the most viewers for SpikeTV for a non-wrestling show to that point. Gould received the $100,000 prize for which he was \\"competing,\\" along with a plasma television and separate vacations to Tahiti and to a spa resort. Upon the truth being revealed, Gould cried out, \\"What is going on?!?\\" Spike TV would later air this cry at the end of its other original productions. When asked about whether he had ever intuited the truth, Gould said that he \\"just chalk[ed] everything up to the oddities of reality television\\" and that he thought he \\"was on the weirdest reality show in history of mankind.\\" In August 2008, Entertainment Weekly interviewed Gould about his experiences on the show. Gould said that the show made him feel \\"dumb\\" and that he \\"wouldn't do the show at all\\" if he was given the choice whether or not to do it again. In January 2013, however, Gould stated in a new interview released the day of the premiere of the show's third season that he had \\"come full circle\\" and had made peace with the experience. He noted that he still hears from fans of the show on Facebook, that in nine years, no one has ever said anything negative to him about it, and that the fear he felt about what people would think of him was \\"...something I drummed up in my head.\\" Post-Joe Schmo Show Appearances Gould recorded commentary on the show for a later rebroadcast of the series. In 2004, Gould taped an unaired cameo appearance for Joe Schmo 2 as a pizza delivery man, and appeared as a referee on 10 Things Every Guy Should Experience. Personal life As of 2008, Gould was married with two children. As of 2013, his family and work status was reported to have remained as such.

It was announced in August 2005 as a joint venture between Edge Resorts and minority partner Starwood. The project was initially expected to cost $1.7 billion, and would include approximately 3,000 hotel, condo hotel, and residential units, as well as a casino, in addition to restaurants, nightclubs, and shopping. The project initially was to be built on located east of the Las Vegas Strip. The cost of the project ultimately increased to $2.5 billion. In June 2006, Edge Resorts purchased an adjacent site that had been planned for the Las Ramblas Resort. Edge Resorts then planned to build Edge East, a boutique hotel district, on the newly acquired property to accompany W Las Vegas. The project was cancelled when Starwood pulled out of the partnership in May 2007. History Since the launch of Starwood's first W Hotel in 1998, Ross Klein, the senior vice president and chief marketing officer of W Hotels, had wanted to open a W hotel in Las Vegas. However, such plans failed for years to materialize as Klein had difficulty finding an adequate location and partner at a time that would be ideal. In 2004, private investment group Edge Resorts began discussions with Starwood about jointly opening a W hotel in Las Vegas. At the time, Edge Resorts owned the Bourbon Street Hotel and Casino, but Starwood considered the building too small and in a poor location, wanting instead to have a potential W hotel on Harmon Avenue. Later that year, Edge Resorts purchased of land at the northeast corner of Harmon Avenue and Koval Lane, occupied by the Ice nightclub. The following year, it purchased an additional of adjacent land from D. R. Horton. The total cost of the site was $108.1 million. In August 2005, Starwood and Edge Resorts announced plans for a $1.7 billion joint project that would include a casino; approximately 3,000 hotel, condo hotel, and residential units; and of meeting space. The property would also include shops, a spa, and a gym. It would be Starwood's first W hotel to include a casino. Under the deal, Edge Resorts would have 75 percent control of the resort, while Starwood would own the remainder and would manage the hotel, to be known as W Las Vegas. The project would be built on the 21-acre site, located east of the Las Vegas Strip and near the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Its primary competitors were expected to be the Hard Rock, Mandalay Bay, the Palms, and Wynn Las Vegas. Investors for Edge Resorts were not concerned about the large amount of Las Vegas hotel condo projects announced up to that point. Residential sales were expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2005, and a 2008 opening was scheduled. The project was still in the design phase at the time of the announcement. In January 2006, it was announced that the project had received $232.5 million in pre-development financing from Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking. Project details were announced in May 2006. The property would include two 50-story glass towers with a modern design, containing a combined total of 4,000 hotel and condo-hotel units, ranging from tp . Prices would start at $650,000, and the total cost of the project had increased to $2.5 billion. It was also announced that Las Vegas' M.J. Dean Construction had been hired as the general contractor, while Las Vegas-based Klai Juba Architects would work with the New York-based Lacina Heitler Architects to design the project along with Charles Allem Designs. Utility installation work had already begun early that month, and M.J. Dean Construction had begun building a $5 million residential sales center. In June 2006, it was announced that an adjacent site, planned for the future Las Ramblas Resort, had been sold to Edge Resorts for $202 million. Edge Resorts planned to construct a boutique hotel district known as Edge East on the newly acquired property to accompany W Las Vegas. The project was also planned to include nightclubs and 10 restaurants. Later that month, Edge put of recently purchased land (later the site of the Allegiant Stadium) up for sale to pay for W Las Vegas and Edge East. In December 2006, Edge Resorts hired Credit Suisse to evaluate offers from people and groups that were interested in partnering with Edge Resorts and Starwood on the project, as rising construction costs and the additional land meant that a third partner would be required to help finance the project. At the time, Edge Resorts denied rumors that Starwood would pull out of the project. W Las Vegas was cancelled in May 2007, after Starwood pulled out of the project. Edge Resorts planned to sell the land, stating that the project \\"could not overcome numerous significant challenges.\\" Up to that time, 750 residential units had been reserved; refunds were issued to people who reserved units. In August 2007, the site was sold to a joint venture group that was led by the Africa Israel Group and included Edge Resorts. In January 2009, plans were announced to build the world's largest hotel on the site, with 6,745 rooms, as well as a casino and retail complex. The project was known as \\"Edge (Las Vegas)\\", with Edge among the partners to have a stake in the project. The joint venture defaulted on loans eight months later, and the property remained vacant. Other versions Sometime before 2015, Starwood and Station Casinos held discussions about developing a W hotel on the site of Station's Wild Wild West Gambling Hall & Hotel. At the SLS Las Vegas on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip, Starwood operated one of the resort's hotel towers, the former LUX Tower, as a separate hotel known as W Las Vegas. It operated from December 2016 to August 2018.

Wealthy widow Mary Abramoff (Levana Finkelstein) tracks him down and pleads with him to go to Russia and retrieve her daughter Julia (Olivia Lee), who has been kidnapped and forced into the sex trade. Nick refuses, claiming he is just a mechanic. John Ridley (Atanas Srebrev), Mary's attorney reveals that they know his past, but he continues to refuse.

They begin driving to the Finnish border and Sasha's thugs give chase. Nick buys them time by luring the thugs into a tunnel, changing cars and setting off a bomb. The group stop at a farm house to tend to Sergei then proceed to the border which has closed for the night; they stay with their contact, Misha, one of Nick's former Spetsnaz soldiers. Sasha stops at the farm house and determines Nick is headed for the border and he continues to chase them. The next morning, Sergei dies of his injuries, and Sasha arrives and Nick's group (Burton, Yuri, and Misha) prepares for a fight. Sasha tries to lure Burton out by bringing Natalia, whom he kills, angering Burton. Nick and his group split up and begin picking off Sasha's men. Finally, Nick confronts Sasha, who grabs Julia. She scratches his face to distract him and Nick shoots his leg; he crawls away but Nick executes him with a shot to the head. Burton and Yuri accompany Julia across the border to Finland where she is reunited with her mother. Nick walks away from the village to Saint Petersburg, his path unknown.

It aired in the United States from September 14, 1985 until September 5, 1987 on CBS with 52 11-minute episodes in 26 half-hour shows produced. Each show consisted of two episodes, the first being an adaptation of one of the books, the second being an original story. The series was nominated in 1987 for a Daytime Emmy award for Outstanding Performer in Children's Programming; it was also nominated that year for a Humanitas Prize in the category of Non-Prime Time Children's Animated Show. In addition to creating the original books, Stan and Jan Berenstain were producers on the show, and wrote some of the scripts. A second cartoon series aired on PBS Kids in 2003-2004. Plot The series tells the story of a bear family that lives in a tree. The bears are just like humans. The family consists of Mama Bear, Papa Q. Bear, Brother Bear, and Sister Bear. The series teaches lessons, continues from the TV specials, and expands Bear Country as well as character development. Each episode follows the struggles of the family, mainly the cubs. Other episodes involve \\"The Bear Detectives and their sniffer hound Snuff\\", Papa Q. Bear's attempts of honey gathering, interaction with forest creatures, and attempts by villains to take over Bear Country. It states that Brother Bear is in 2nd Grade then in 3rd Grade while Sister Bear is in kindergarten then in 1st Grade. The characters and setting are from various books written by Stan & Jan Berenstain as well as from several television specials by Joe Cates. Other characters are Actual Factual, Big Paw, Mayor Horace J. Honeypot, Farmer Ben, and Grizzly Gramps & Gran. Characters also introduced are Officer Marguerete, Queen Nectar, and Jake. Queen Nectar and Jake are not bears but they do talk and interact with the humanoid bears. Sister Bear plays with many of the forest animals such as Frog & Butterfly. There are many other background characters that live in the nearby forest land; The bears live among the forest and nature just as they did in the television specials. The main antagonists of the series are the swindler Raffish Ralph and occasionally Weasel McGreed, seen in six episodes. To a lesser extent, Too Tall Grizzly is another antagonist, again serving as the school bully.

They continued to make one holiday special each year for five years. They stopped making holiday specials after \\"The Berenstain Bears Play Ball\\" and began making a TV series based on the books and to a lesser extent, the same TV specials produced. Joe Cates and Buzz Potamkin produced this TV series as well. Elliott Lawrence continued to score music for the episodes which were based on his compositions from the five specials, although faster-paced. While they no longer break out in song, the theme music (matching part of Stars and Stripes Forever) resembles the song lyrics from the specials. The program was produced by Southern Star/Hanna-Barbera Australia Productions with new voice actors. The characters no longer talk in rhyme, and the TV series has the updated appearance and no longer has the rustic design of the earliest books. This TV series expanded tremendously of Bear Country which includes many characters, economy, and government. As a result, the episodes have a faster timing and the characters seem much busier compared with the TV specials. The stories are now told without the narrator and are 11 minutes in length. The bear family had complex patterns on their clothes which were changed to solid colours for the animated specials, with the exception of Mama Bear's inside hat. The TV series omitted the spots entirely, but Mama's yellow \\"Go And Meet\\" hat was featured in a \\"Ghost Of The Forest\\" adaptation. The episode \\"Ghost Of The Forest\\" resembles a Halloween special, but it is a regular episode. Broadcast and home media Reruns aired briefly on TLC's Ready Set Learn block from September 28, 1998, to January 8, 1999, when a contract dispute forced TLC to pull the show off the schedule. During the early 2000s, reruns were later seen as part of the DIC Kids Network syndicated programming block which primarily aired on some stations of FOX the also now-defunct UPN, and The WB, but the episodes were edited and time-compressed by DIC. The series has not been seen on American television since 2006. In Australia, where Southern Star was created, the series was aired on Network Ten. A few episodes are available on VHS from various companies like Random House, Feature Films for Families, and Columbia/Tristar Home Video, but the opening title as well as the title cards were changed. The introduction scene showing highlights from the episodes was removed. The opening title shot was flipped (The bear family now runs in the opposite direction). The opening title was previously accompanied with the caption: \\"The Berenstain Bears Show: Created By Stan & Jan Berenstain,\\" which was removed entirely. The episode title cards were originally dark green with a round portrait in a wooden frame. The title cards on the VHS releases instead use part of the main title sequence. The end credits now scroll and the end music is sped up. The 2009 DVD releases from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment don't use the edited versions of the episodes that have previously been released on VHS, but use unedited versions of episodes not previously released on VHS.

An example of this is the manger near the Uffington White Horse. It may also be described as a small, irregular step-like formation on steep hillslopes, especially on those used for pasture which are formed by soil creep or erosion of surface soils exacerbated by the trampling of livestock such as sheep or cattle. Synonyms are: catstep cattle terracing, sheep or cattle track. Early investigators believed that animals grazing the hillsides caused them, but further examination revealed places where terracettes abruptly ended at steep rock faces or at soils of different composition.

It stars Jean-Claude van Damme and Lawrence Taylor. It is the third and final collaboration between Jean-Claude van Damme and Hong Kong film director Ringo Lam. The film was released direct-to-DVD in the United States on November 25, 2003. Plot Kyle LeBlanc is an American working overseas in Magnitogorsk, Russia. When he hears his wife being attacked over the phone, Kyle rushes home, but is too late to save her. Sergio Ković, the man who raped and murdered his wife, buys the judge and is found not guilty due to lack of evidence. Enraged, Kyle steals a gun from a security guard and shoots Sergio multiple times in front of the entire court house, killing him. For this, he is sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He soon befriends fellow American, Billy Cooper, a 21-year-old inmate who is subjected to constant rape and beatings by prison fighter, Andrei, a member of the Russian Mafia with the assistance of the guards, and Malakai, another American prisoner who uses a wheelchair and claims to know the ins and outs of prison life. After getting into a brawl with Andrei, who provoked him in a way similar to his wife's murderer, Kyle is put in solitary confinement. Then he is transferred to a cell with inmate 451, an African-American prisoner, who has the reputation of killing inmates, and the sadistic head of the guards believes he will do the same to Kyle. However, over time they begin to trust one another. The general who runs the prison amuses himself by betting on fights between his prisoners to fill his pockets. After savagely killing Andrei in his first fight, Kyle immediately suffers a mental breakdown as everyone watches in horror. Soon he is continuously forced into more fights because the general and guards know he is a sure thing, as he slowly loses his sanity. At one point 451 asks him, \\"Do you even know who you are? Probably not.\\" Meanwhile, Billy attempts multiple times to escape the prison, first by running during outside work detail, and again by sneaking off during the Russian Independence Day celebration; the latter fails as he is betrayed by Malakai, who informs the guards because his need of special medicine. 451 discovers his betrayal, and later, in retaliation, pours lighter fluid on him and sets him on fire. As he watches Malakai burn to death, he recalls a memory. He set a teacher on fire whom abused and molested him as a child. After being locked in a cell with prison fighter Valya overnight one night, Billy is raped and beaten to within an inch of his life after he spits in Valya's face. Billy later succumbs to his injuries, but before he dies, he whispers to Kyle, \\"Don't let them turn you into something you're not.\\" With this advice, Kyle now knows he must fight another battle: the fight for inner peace, as it is the only way he can become the man he once was. Kyle refuses to fight Valya in his next match, and as a result, is hung by his arms outside for all to see. However, seeing Kyle's courage and his ability to stay strong during his punishment, the prison gangs decide to put aside their rivalries and unite, following suit by refusing to fight. Kyle is released soon from his restraints and sent to the infirmary. During his recovery, he dreams of his wife who tells him \\"Nobody's ever gone as long as there is someone to remember them\\". Sometime after he is recovered, he is forced into a fight in his own cell block with Miloc, a gargantuan prisoner kept separate from the general population who Kyle kept hearing through the walls from his time in solitary confinement. During the fight, Kyle knocks on a door repeatedly, making Miloc recognize him, as this was his only form of communication, and he embraces him as a friend. A guard orders them to continue at gunpoint. Kyle demands the guards kill him instead, stating he will not fight anymore. Witnessing this, the prisoners begin to protest. Kyle and Miloc turn on the guards and free the prisoners from their cells, igniting a full-scale riot. Miloc is fatally shot protecting Kyle, who comforts him as he succumbs to his wounds. Soon, 451 gives Kyle the evidence of all the murders and corruption that have happened in this prison for the past 20 something years that he has planned to expose to the US government. While the guards are getting the prisoners under control, 451 shows Kyle a secret passage to the prison garage for their next move. It will require Kyle to fight one more time to gain access as he is aware the general will have him executed if he wins. Kyle participates in final fight, which he wins, but the guards have indicated they will kill him afterwards. When two guards take Kyle to the garage, 451 launches an attack and kills one of them while Kyle holds the other at gunpoint and pins him down to the ground. After taking the key to free himself, Kyle takes one of the guards' uniforms to disguise himself and drives off in one of their cars while 451 stays behind to assassinate the general for his misdeeds. His final fate is unknown, but after the movie's final scene cuts to black, the audience is bizarrely told that three months later, the fictional prison was shut down.

Reception Robert Pardi of TV Guide rated it 1/5 stars and called it a \\"pokey exercise in cellblock sadism\\" that does not live up Lam's previous work. Jason P. Vargo of IGN rated it 5/10 stars and wrote that it is \\"strictly for Van Damme fans only\\". Beyond Hollywood wrote that although the film has many stock characters, it enjoyably plays on the usual conventions of a Van Damme film. Ian Jane of DVD Talk rated it 3/5 stars and called it \\"a pleasant surprise\\" and the best of Van Damme's recent films. David Johnson of DVD Verdict wrote that although the film attempts to bring a new facet to Van Damme's films, it only ends up being clichéd in different ways than his usual films.

The lake was formed with the construction of Shaver Lake Dam, which was built by Southern California Edison and completed in 1927. The 180-foot dam was built in 50-foot (15-m) blocks, with a keyway to hold it in place and a 75-centimeter (30-inch) copper sheet to make it watertight. Its capacity is . Some water from the lake is discharged into Stevenson Creek for fish and other wildlife, but the rest is diverted to Big Creek, where it powers several hydroelectric plants in succession. The area now covered by the lake was extensively logged before the dam was built, and an extensive log flume system several miles long was constructed to bring logs down the mountain. The town to this day maintains a nostalgic logging theme. Several buildings in town are in fact old, converted sawmills.

Plot The main character Gus experiences vivid dreams during his narcoleptic episodes, which inspire him to create comic book style art of extremely high quality. When Samuel Pupkin, the psychiatrist who runs a group attended by Gus, learns of this, he recalls his own desire to be a comic book artist, instead of following the family tradition of psychiatry, a dream prevented by his lack of artistic talent. Motivated by greed, jealousy, and desire for fame he hatches a plot, involving figure skating assassins, to steal Gus's work and pass it off as his own. The attempt on Gus's life fails but he ends up in a coma. Pupkin pays Gus's wife and best friend (who have begun an affair) for the art and sells it to a failed- comedian turned successful publisher, who in turn plans to erase the text and replace it with his own, and in this way have his genius for comedy finally recognized. When Gus awakens from his coma, he reports to the police that someone is trying to kill him, but as he can think of no reason why, the police dismiss his claims. He then discovers that he is no longer narcoleptic, but finds it convenient to pretend he still is. In this way he discovers the affair of his wife and best friend, and through further investigation the theft of his work. The publisher angry that because of the Pupkin's deception, Gus could cause problems for them, demands that Pupkin solve it. Pupkin once more sends the assassins after Gus, but Gus's best friend, after wrestling with his conscience, talks them out of killing him. The police now believe his story and investigate the publisher who goes to jail, where he finally finds success as a comedian, performing for the other inmates. Pupkin goes insane and is confined to a hospital. Gus reconciles with his wife and finally gets a job. In a minor role, Jean-Claude Van Damme appears as an imagined version of himself, when one character who idolises him as the ultimate 'Karate man', imagines a conversation where he acts as that character's conscience.

An outwash fan is a fan-shaped body of sediments deposited by braided streams from a melting glacier. Sediment locked within the ice of the glacier, gets transported by the streams of meltwater, and deposits on the outwash plain, at the terminus of the glacier. The outwash, the sediment transported and deposited by the meltwater and that makes up the fan, is usually poorly sorted due to the short distance traveled before being deposited.  Formation  Outwash fans typically form from valley Glaciers in the mountains, that are flowing downhill. Thus, outwash fans are usually found in colder environments where glaciers are more prevalent and are often located where a valley or canyon empties out onto a flatter wider plain. Outwash fans form when melt-water from a retreating glacier deposits transported sediment in the shape of a fan along the outwash plain. Glaciers contain large amounts of sediment (i.e. sand, silt, clay), that are gathered through glacial erosional processes such as abrasion between the glacier and the underlying rocks, and through glacial plucking. As the glacier begins to retreat and ablation increases, the melting ice deposits sediments from a single source at the terminus of the glacier, melt-water from the glacier forming a braided stream then carries the sediment away and redeposits it further away from the glacier. The sedimentation of the outwash fan is often poorly sorted due to the short distance covered by the transported sediment, however, water runoff from the glacier acts as a natural sorter. Finer materials such as silt and clay are redeposited further away from the glacier, while larger sediments such as pebbles and rocks remain closest to the glacier. Because the sediments rely on melt water for transportation, the ablation rate directly affects the development of an outwash fan. Other factors that affect fan morphology include the slope of the outwash fan and the depth and width of its distributive channels.Kjær K.H., Sultan L., Krüger J., Schomacker A.Architecture and sedimentation of fan- shaped outwash in front of the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap, Iceland Sedimentary Geology, 172 (2004) Minor Outwash Fans Unlike the more extensive outwash fans, that transport larger sized material by high energy streams from underneath the glacier, minor fans are mainly made up of fine grained sediments (i.e. sand) and are deposited by low energy streams that drain debris along the glaciers surface.Krüger J. “Development of minor outwash fans at Kotlujökull, Iceland” Quaternary Science Reviews, 16 (1997), pp. 649-659 References *http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/outwash Krüger J. “Development of minor outwash fans at Kotlujökull, Iceland” Quaternary Science Reviews, 16 (1997), pp. 649-659 *Kjær K.H., Sultan L., Krüger J., Schomacker A.Architecture and sedimentation of fan-shaped outwash in front of the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap, Iceland Sedimentary Geology, 172 (2004), pp. 139-163 ;Specific Category:Glacial landforms ","title":"Outwash fan"},{"id":"4232859","text":"Lilan may refer to: * List of characters in Suikoden IV#Minor characters * Lilan, East Azerbaijan, a village in Hamadan Province, Iran * Lilan, Hamadan, a village in Hamadan Province, Iran * Lilan, Markazi, a village in Markazi Province, Iran ","title":"Lilan"},{"id":"4232861","text":"Roy Wilkins Auditorium is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Its boundaries stretch from South 22nd Street on the west to South 17th Street on the east. The southern boundary is clearly defined as the south side of Shunk Street but its northern boundary is irregular in stretching from the north side of Porter Street between South 17th Street and South 21st Street, along east side of South 21st Street to West Passyunk Avenue, then along the south side of West Passyunk Avenue to its northwestern tip at South 22nd Street. It is named after Stephen Girard whose South Philadelphia property was developed in the 1920s by the City of Philadelphia. History Girard's country home was on a plot of land he named Gentilhommiere in what was formerly called Passyunk Township of Philadelphia County. He was likely the richest man in the United States when he died in 1831, and he left most of his $6 million estate to the City of Philadelphia. Girard's will stated that the city must establish a school for poor orphaned white boys in his name, and that Gentilhommiere must not be sold. To meet the second stipulation, the Board of City Trusts, trustee of the Girard Estate, developed 481 rental homes which became the Girard Estate homes. Most of the semi-detached homes were designed by architects John and James H. Windrim, and were built from 1906 to 1916. The architectural styles included Bungalow, Prairie, Mission, Jacobean Revival and Colonial Revival. They are a marked difference from the typical South Philly row homes. In 1950, the city received permission to sell all 481 homes to private owners. All the homes were sold within two years. In 1979, Girard Estate became a location for \\"Rocky II.\\" The crew filmed scenes on the 2300 block of S. Lambert Street for a week. In the film, the character Rocky Balboa bought 2313 S. Lambert St. with his winnings from the bout in the first film. (He even comments on the address, pointing out that the number \\"almost add up to nine!\\") All exteriors were shot on the street; house interiors were shot on a soundstage. On March 15, 1981, Philadelphia organized crime boss Phillip Testa returned to his Girard Estates twin home at 2117 Porter Street and as he was opening the door a nail bomb exploded under his front porch killing him and doing extensive damage the house.Capuzzo, Michael \\"The Murder Room: The Heirs of Sherlock Holmes Gather to Solve the World's Most Perplexing Cold Cases\\" p. 189.

The peak is located on the border between Alameda and Contra Costa counties, within the boundaries of Tilden Regional Park, and directly behind the University of California, Berkeley campus. The peak was named for the California grizzly bear which inhabited the local area until the late 1800s. The last sighting locally was by a man who was reportedly killed by a grizzly in Strawberry Canyon below Grizzly Peak in the 1860s. The first local killing of a grizzly by a European occurred in 1772, also along Strawberry Creek just west of what is today the UC Berkeley campus, within what is now downtown Berkeley. The shooting by Spanish soldiers was recorded by Father Juan Crespi. The last grizzly in all of California was killed in the Sierra foothills east of Fresno in August 1922. Grizzly Peak became more accessible in 1932 when Grizzly Peak Boulevard was constructed along the ridge line of the Berkeley Hills. The name was extended to the previously-constructed ridge line stretch of Euclid Avenue to the north shortly thereafter. This portion was and remains a residential area of Berkeley while the original stretch is largely undeveloped. Grizzly Peak Boulevard now extends from Kenyon Avenue in Kensington in the north, through Berkeley and Oakland to an intersection with Skyline Blvd. above Oakland to the south. Before Grizzly Peak Boulevard was constructed, the location of its current intersection with Claremont (before 1892 known as Telegraph Road) and Fish Ranch Road was historically an important pass through the Berkeley Hills, before the tunnel that preceded today's Caldecott Tunnel was constructed through the hills in 1903; an inn and stage stop called the Summit House was located here. Today, Grizzly Peak is a popular location for people to get a unique view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the surrounding Bay Area.

Staff as of 2011 include Sal Gallego of Some Girls, Marcus D’Camp, Brandon McMinn, Mike McGuire, Becky DiGiglio, and Pearson. According to Pearson, the label's best selling releases have been Discography by Swing Kids, as well as March on Electric Children by The Blood Brothers. Three One G has released a compilation of Queen covers by their artists called Dynamite With a Laserbeam: Queen as Heard Through the Meat Grinder of Three One G, as well as a similar tribute to The Birthday Party titled Release The Bats. There has also been a DVD documentary, This is Circumstantial Evidence, made about Three One G. Collaborations Reviewers have described the Three One G community of musicians under the umbrella term \\"freak punk\\" or \\"spaz-rock,\\" saying \\"the intense, the slightly frightening, and the brutal all find a place for themselves and their music in Three One G Records.\\" Most of the label's bands have shared members or interact within the same musical community, and according to Pearson, According to SSG Music, \\"It seems that members of San Diego label Three One G decide to form new supergroups at least once a year.\\" Three One G bands Holy Molar, Ground Unicorn Horn, and Head Wound City were all formed with earlier musicians on the label. The label's supergroup Retox included Gabe Serbian and Pearson of The Locust, and many of the bands such as The Crimson Curse and Cattle Decapitation are connected to The Locust as well.

In accordance with the 2017 Constitution of Thailand, the Senate is a non- partisan legislative chamber, composed of 250 members. All 250 Senators are appointed by the Royal Thai Military. Senators serve five year terms in office. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives were abolished as a result of the 2014 Thai coup d'état. These were replaced with the unicameral National Legislative Assembly, a body of 250 members, selected by the National Council for Peace and Order. However, the new 2017 constitution, which was approved by a referendum in 2016, re-established the Senate. Following the 2019 general elections, the Senate is to be composed of 250 military-appointed members, so it is considered as a rubber stamp legislative. After the promulgation of the 2017 Constitution in April 2017, the Senate was re- established but the constitution allowed the military National Legislative Assembly to remain in place until the Senate was formed following the 2019 general election. History The idea of bicameralism first permeated Thai politics with the Constitution of 1946, when the government of Pridi Banomyong introduced a Senate modelled on the British House of Lords. For the first time, an upper house came into existence in Thailand. The Senate was to be fully elected, however, the elections would be indirect, as the House of Representatives would elect the senators, for six-year terms. The 1946 Constitution was soon abrogated in a military coup. Subsequent constitutions saw only occasional bicameralism, and when it did exist, the Senate was always filled with appointees from the military and the elite. The 1997 Constitution saw a return to a fully elected Senate. That constitution was abrogated after the 2006 coup, and replaced with one calling for a half-elected/half-appointed Senate. * 1947 – First Thai Senate established with 100 members, all royally appointed. * 1952 – Establishment of a unicameral National Assembly with 123 members. * 1968 – Re-establishment of the Senate with 164 royally-appointed members. * 1972 - The Thai Legislature is banned by Thanom Kittikachorn. * 1974 – Return of the royally-appointed Senate. * 1976 – Re-establishment of a unicameral National Assembly with 360 members, all royally appointed. * 1978 – Return of a Senate with 225 royally-appointed members. * 1991 – Establishment of a unicameral National Assembly with 292 royally-appointed members. * 1997 – Establishment for the first time of a fully and directly elected Senate with 200 members for a 6-year term. * 2006 – Following the military coup, an interim charter was signed establishing a 250-member National Legislative Assembly. * 2007 – Half of the Senate is appointed, half is elected as established by referendum under the 2007 Constitution. * 2014 – Following the military coup, an interim constitution was passed establishing a 220-member National Legislative Assembly. * 2018 – After the signing of the 2017 Constitution, the National Assembly was reestablished and the NLA was dissolved, with the Senate to be composed of 250 military-appointed members following the 2019 general elections. Composition The 250-person Senate is composed of 194 members selected by the ruling junta. Fifty senators represent 10 professional and social groups: bureaucrats, teachers, judges, farmers, and private companies. A shortlist of 200 were proposed to the NCPO which made the final selection of fifty. The remaining six Senate positions are reserved for the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, the defence permanent secretary, the national police chief, and the heads of the army, navy, and air force, who are all senators ex officio. 104 of the 250 senators are military or police officers. Qualifications The qualifications for the membership of the Senate could be found in section 115, Part 3, Chapter 6 of the 2007 Constitution. A candidate intent on being a member of the Senate had to be a natural born citizen of Thailand as well as being 40 years or older on the year of election or selection. The candidate must have graduated with at least a bachelor's degree or an equivalent. If the candidate was to be elected, he or she must have been born, must have had a home and had to be registered to vote in the province which the candidate intended to represent. The candidate must not have been an ascendant, spouse or a child of a member of the House of Representatives or any person holding a political position and must not have been a member of a political party for at least five years. All other disqualifications were similar to that of the House, the individual must not have been: addicted to drugs, been bankrupt, a convicted felon, a member of a local administration, a civil servant, a member of the judiciary or any other government agency. Being disenfranchised (being a member of the clergy, felon, or mentally infirm). If the candidate was a member of a local administration or a Minister he must have left his post for a period of at least five years before being eligible. Appointment Depending on the situation in each constitution. Term The term of the Senate is five years. The term is fixed, therefore the Senate cannot be dissolved under any circumstances and would be re-elected in accordance with a Royal Decree issued thirty days after the expiration of the term. Membership Members of the Senate are entitled use the title Senator in front of their names (. Membership of an elected Senator began on the senate election day, while an appointed senator became a member after the publication of the election result by the Electoral Commission. Senators could not hold more than one consecutive term, therefore senators could not be re-elected. A Senator whose membership expired before a new Senator could be named continued his or her duties until such seats were occupied. If there was a vacancy the seat was immediately filled either by election or appointment. Powers  The Senate shares many powers with the House of Representatives; these include: *Legislation *Scrutiny *Passing of annual Appropriations Bills *Constitutional Amendments Exclusive Powers: *Creating and appointing committee to examine and investigate affairs. *Passing approval resolutions advising the King in certain appointments. **Judges of the Constitutional Court of Thailand **Election Commissioners **Ombudsmen **Members of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, State Audit Commission (including the Auditor General) and National Human Rights Commission. *The Senate also advised the selection and the actual selection of certain members of the Judiciary. *Selection of its Officers. *Expulsion of members. *Determination of its own rules and procedures. Leadership The Senate elected three presiding officers; one President and two Vice Presidents. The President of the Senate was also the ex-officio Vice President of the National Assembly of Thailand. The election was done by secret ballot, after a resolution finalizing the selection the name was submitted to the king for formal appointment. There were no partisan officers as the Senate of Thailand was a non-partisan chamber.

The system of government of Thailand is that of a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. The system of the Thai legislative branch is modelled after the Westminster system. The House of Representatives has 500 members, all of which are democratically elected: 375 members were directly elected through single constituency elections, while the other 125 are elected through party-list proportional representation. The roles and powers of the House of Representatives were enshrined in the Constitution of 2017. The House of Representatives was temporarily abolished as a result of the 2014 Thai coup d'état and replaced with the unicameral National Legislative Assembly, a body of 250 members, selected by the National Council for Peace and Order.

History The House of Representatives was established after the Revolution of 1932, when the Khana Ratsadon (the \\"People's Party\\"), overthrew the absolute monarchy and replaced it with a system of constitutional monarchy. When King Prajadhipok signed the temporary constitution of 1932, he established the first legislative assembly in Thailand, It was an entirely royally-appointed chamber. The first session of the People's Assembly was held on June 28, 1932, in the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. From then on, the House existed in various forms until it was abolished in 2014: See more at: Constitutions of Thailand * 1946 - The 1946 constitution established a fully elected House of Representatives. * 1949 - On June 5, 1949, Orapin Chaiyakan became the first woman to be elected to hold a post in the National Assembly of Thailand (specifically, the House of Representatives).Sopchokchai, Orapin.

Qualification The qualifications to be a candidate for the House of Representatives were outlined in Section 101, Part 2, Chapter 6 of the 2007 Constitution. The candidate had to be a citizen of Thailand by birth only. The citizen had to be at the age of twenty- five or older on election day and had been born in the province in which he or she intended to stand as a candidate. The candidate must have been a voter and therefore had to be on the electoral register for at least five years directly before the election, and he or she must also had a house or have been in public service in the province for five years. The candidate must also had been a member of an educational institution in that province for at least five consecutive years. Politically, a candidate had to be a member of one political party for a period of at least ninety days before election day, except in cases of dissolution where thirty days was the minimum period. This was done to discourage party switching before the election. For party list candidates, they must also had to meet the same qualifications except for the provincial restrictions. They were instead divided in lists based on provincial groups. Those specifically barred from being candidates were those: addicted to drugs, declared bankrupt, unable to vote (see voter eligibility below), former convicted felons (the individual had to wait for five years after release to become eligible), removed from public service for being corrupt or incompetent, had assets confiscated due to embezzlement and finally, the individual had not been a member of the government or civil service, Senate, local administrations, member of the judiciary or other independent agencies. Elections Before its abolishment, the House of Representatives had 500 members. 375 members were directly elected in single constituency elections by first-past-the-post voting. The 375 constituencies were divided by population according to the census and tambons. The other 125 members were voted based on 'proportional representation' it is actually in truth a parallel voting system or more precisely the Mixed Member Majoritarian system (MMM). In Thai general elections, voters had two votes: one to select the member of parliament for their constituencies and the second to choose which party they prefer. Seats were assigned to parties as a result through the d'Hondt method. In accordance with the 2007 Constitution of Thailand, a general election was held every 4 years. Dissolution could happen anytime, which was done by the King with the advice of the prime minister through the use of the royal decree. Elections were held under universal suffrage; every voter had to be a citizen of Thailand, if not by birth then by being a citizen for 5 years. The voter had to be over 18 years old before the year the election was held. Voting in elections were also mandatory as missing an election would result in the loss of the right to be involved in political activities. Those barred from voting in House elections were members of the clergy, those suspended from the privilege for various reasons, detainees under legal or court orders and being of unsound mind or of mental infirmity. Term and dissolution The term of the House of Representatives was exactly four years from the previous election day. Upon the expiration of the House, the King would issue a decree calling for a general election of the House, in which the date of the election had to be announced. This had to be done within forty days of the expiration. The date of the election had to be the same for the entire Kingdom. The King held the royal prerogative to dissolve the House before its expiration. When this happened a royal decree was issued where the election date was announced; this had to be done in no less than forty days and not more than sixty days from the date of the dissolution. The reasons and circumstances of a dissolution could be made only once. Membership Members of the House of Representatives were generally called Members of Parliament or MPs (. The membership of the House of Representatives commenced on election day. If there was a vacancy in the membership of the House, and it was not due to expiration or dissolution, it had to be re-occupied. Vacancies could occur due to death, resignation, conviction and/or expulsion (only by a parliamentary party through a 3/4 majority vote). If the vacancy was of a constituency member then an election had to be held within forty days of the vacancy, unless it was less than 180 days of the present term of the House, then the vacancy could remain. In the case where the vacancy was made by a proportional representative member, the vacancy would be filled by the Speaker of the House of Representatives by submitting the name of the next candidate in the party list (submitted on election day) to be published in the Royal Gazette. This had to be done within seven days. If no name was found then the vacancy could remain unfilled. Members of the House who had filled a vacancy under either of these procedures could only remain in the House for the remainder of its present term. Power and privileges Powers According to the 2007 Constitution of Thailand, the House of Representatives was granted many powers, most of them were shared with Senate of Thailand. These common powers were: * Legislation * Scrutiny * Passing of annual appropriations bills * Constitutional amendments Exclusive powers: * Primary legislative chamber. * Creating and appointing committees to examine bills. * Power to call ministers to account (by appearing in the chamber and answering questions) * Removal of the prime minister through a \\"vote of no confidence\\" (more than 1/5 to vote for a debate, and a simple majority for removal). * Removal of ministers (more than 1/6 to vote for a debate, and a simple majority for removal). * Selection of its officers. * Expulsion of members * Determination of its own rules and procedures. Privileges No member of the House could be arrested, detained, or summoned by a warrant for an inquiry as the suspect in a criminal case unless permission of the House of which he or she was a member was obtained or he or she was arrested in flagrante delicto. Leadership Presiding officers The executive committee of House of Representatives consisted of one speaker and two deputy speakers to be its presiding officers. The Speaker of the House was also the ex officio President of the National Assembly of Thailand. The election was done by a secret ballot in the first session; after a resolution was passed; the elected would be formally approved by the King. The Speaker and Deputy Speakers of the House could not be members of the cabinet or any political party executive committee. The speaker and his deputies were not entitled to represent partisan interests and had to exercise their powers on a non-partisan basis. Leader of the Governing Coalition The Constitution stipulated that the Prime Minister and the Ministers had to be former members of the House of Representatives. After the first session, the House had to vote in a resolution to elect a Prime Minister, after which the King would formally approve him within thirty days. The Prime Minister- elect was always the leader of the largest party in the House. However, under the electoral system, the House resulted in a hung parliament. After the 2007 election, six parties formed a governing coalition, electing Samak Sundaravej of the largest party, People's Power Party (PPP), the Prime Minister. On August 5, 2011, the House elected Yingluck Shinawatra as Prime Minister against Abhisit Vejjajiva of the Democrat Party, to a vote of 265 for and 159 against. Leader of the Opposition After the appointment of the Cabinet, the King appointed the official Leader of the Opposition of Thailand. The Leader of the Opposition had to be the leader of the largest party with no members holding any ministerial positions. His party had to be larger than one fifth of the total number of the House. If no Party met this qualification then the Leader with most votes from parties with no ministerial positions would then be appointed. The Royal appointment had to be countersigned by the President of the National Assembly. The Leader of the Opposition led the Shadow Cabinet of Thailand.

The Kingsmill area is between the north bank of the James River just east (downstream) of the site where the first permanent English settlement in North America at Jamestown was established in 1607 and Interstate Highway 64. Highway access to most of the area's businesses and attractions is from U.S. Route 60 between the eastern city limits of Williamsburg and the adjacent community of Grove, or from Virginia State Route 199, which forms a semi-circular beltway of sorts around Williamsburg's southern side. History Kingsmill Plantation A prominent member of the Virginia Company, Richard Kingsmill, became the namesake of the Kingsmill Plantation. The Virginia Company was a for-profit organization chartered in England which was charged with the founding and settlement of Virginia under the reign of King James I. Richard Kingsmill was given one of the first land grants of in the southwest area of what later became a much larger plantation. Elizabeth Kingsmill married William Tayloe (the immigrant) and he inherited the land from her father. After his death in 1655, the administrator for his estate William Tayloe (the nephew) sold 1,200 acres to Lewis Burwell II in 1693. In the mid-1730s, British Colonel Lewis Burwell III established a plantation which he named Kingsmill Plantation. It included a mansion, outbuildings and garden.William M. Kelso (Auth.), Kingsmill Plantations, 1619–1800. Archaeology of Country Life in Colonial Virginia [1St Edition], 978-0-12-403480-8, 0124034802 Elsevier Inc, Academic Press 1984. He was the colonial customs inspector for the upper James River. Along the river, Burwell's Landing, site of his inspection station, also featured a tavern, storehouse, warehouse, and ferry house. Quarterpath Road extended between Burwell's Landing and Williamsburg.History  Kingsmill Resort . Kingsmill.com (1973-10-03). Retrieved on 2011-06-02. The Kingsmill area saw action during the American Revolutionary War. The house burned in 1843. Only the office and the kitchen still stand; they are among the earliest brick dependencies still extant in Virginia. American Civil War Action during the American Civil War (1861–65) also skirted Kingsmill Plantation lands. In 1862, Union troops under Major General George B. McClellan engaged in a failed attempt to seize the Confederate capital of Richmond. Slowly and carefully, much to the frustration of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, McClellan assembled huge naval forces and a massive siege train of land-based troops, arms and supplies around a staging area based at the union stronghold of Fort Monroe at the tip of the Virginia Peninsula, where the harbor of Hampton Roads had been under federal control via siege for about a year already. Forces under McClellan for what has become known as the Peninsula Campaign dwarfed all previous American expeditions at the time, transporting 121,500 men, 44 artillery batteries, 1,150 wagons, over 15,000 horses, and tons of equipment and supplies. An English observer remarked that it was the \\"stride of a giant.\\" Sears, Young Napoleon, pp. 167–69. McClellan's plan initially was to utilize the James and York rivers, especially the former, which was known to be navigable to Richmond, in combination with his land-based forces, to attack simultaneously and overwhelm the unknown resources of the rebels at Richmond. However, even as several months were spent through the winter of 1862 training new troops and bringing these many Union assets into position, the portion of the scheme which depended upon control of the James River ran into trouble. In March, the Battle of Hampton Roads between the first ironclad warships took place. Although the conflict between the two ships was inconclusive, the new technologies were to change naval warfare dramatically, and control of the harbor of Hampton Roads was brought into serious question. Although the Union never lost control of the entrance to the harbor, and was able to retake Norfolk and Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth shortly thereafter, Union ships were unable to move past heavily defended Drewry's Bluff east of Richmond along the James River. It appeared unlikely that situation would improve. McClellan realized that his plan to take Richmond would almost certainly depend upon his land forces alone. In early April 1862, McClellan's massive siege train began moving cautiously westerly up the Peninsula toward the Confederate citadel. Throughout the campaign, McClellan was convinced (erroneously) that he was facing much larger opposing forces than he was. At times, he even estimated these forces to greatly outnumber his own, frequently and bitterly complaining to Lincoln (his Commander-in-Chief), who had withheld from McClellan a much smaller force of federal troops to maintain a defensive position around Washington, D.C. The Confederate strategy of the early portion of the Peninsula Campaign became one of delays, providing vital time for defenses to be built outside Richmond. The advancing Union forces were confronted with a series of three defensive lines erected across the Peninsula, which were manned primarily by greatly outnumbered forces led by General John B. Magruder. The first, about north of Fort Monroe, contained infantry outposts and artillery redoubts, but was insufficiently manned to prevent any Union advance. Its primary purpose was to prevent the Union from learning much about the second line. Known as the Warwick Line, this second, and by far largest of the three defensive lines, was about a dozen miles east of Williamsburg, along the Warwick River. It was anchored by Yorktown on the north and Mulberry Island on the south. It consisted of redoubts, rifle pits, and fortifications behind the Warwick River. By enlarging two dams on the river, the Confederates developed the river as a significant military obstacle in its own right. The third defensive line was a series of forts just east of Williamsburg, which waited unmanned for use by the army if it had to fall back from Yorktown.Sears, Gates of Richmond, pp. 26, 70. Although greatly outnumbered, defenders along the first and second lines under former thespian \\"Prince\\" John Magruder took advantage of the poor visibility due to the seasonally heavy undergrowth of the naturally-wooded and swampy terrain. They used elaborate ruse tactics and guerrilla raids to intimidate McClellan and his leaders into thinking they were facing far larger forces, which increased their caution and greatly slowed their progress westward. Stephen Sears, the author of the To The Gates of Richmond, described Magruder's having his troops march back and forth behind the lines with great fanfare to appear to be a larger force, as \\"performances of the Prince John Players.\\" Magruder's efforts appeared successful, as the ever-cautious McClellan moved very slowly with his forces. These were substantially larger than those of the Confederate defenders, even when the latter were reinforced by the arrival of the Army of Northern Virginia under General Joseph E. Johnston. Meanwhile, the Confederates built their long defensive line outside Richmond. While there were several armed conflicts with loss of life, after finally overtaking the first line and meeting minimal resistance, McClellan chose to carefully amass his troops and plan a major offensive, taking the better part of 30 days to do so. He had huge cannons brought up the York River by ship and installed in a position favorable for his planned assault of Yorktown. The night before McClellan was finally positioned to launch his major offensive against Warwick Line, the Confederate troops quietly withdrew and retreated toward Richmond via Williamsburg.Rafuse, p. 211; Esposito, map 41; Burton, p. 24; Salmon, p. 79. Discovering only empty works and Quaker gun in the abandoned fortifications on May 3, McClellan sent his cavalry racing after the escaping Confederates. He also loaded a division of infantry aboard ships to sail up the York River to the west in an attempt to outflank the Confederates' apparent retreat toward Richmond. Only two roads led from the abandoned Warwick Line to be used by the massive equipment and numerous troops of the Union siege train in pursuing the fleeing Confederates, who had a head start. These were the Williamsburg-Yorktown Road and the Williamsburg-Lee's Mill Road. They converged about east of Williamsburg. The weather had been rainy, and both armies slogged along the dirt roads of the sandy terrain. These undoubtedly became deeper in mud and more difficult to traverse. The Williamsburg Line was the third line of defensive fortifications across the Peninsula. It was anchored by College Creek, a tributary of the James River, on the south and Queen's Creek, a tributary of the York River on the north. Under the leadership of local planter Benjamin S. Ewell, president of the College of William and Mary, a series of 14 redoubts were built along the line. Named Fort Magruder, Redoubt Number 6, was the center of the convergence of the roads from Yorktown and Lee's Mill. It was shaped as an elongated pentagon, with walls high and nine feet thick. The earthworks were protected by a dry moat nine feet deep. It mounted eight guns.Virginia Forts: page 7. Northamericanforts.com (2009-11-08). Retrieved on 2011-06-02. Several of the redoubts were just east of the Quarterpath Road, which lead from Williamsburg to the landing for Kingsmill Plantation on the James River. Despite the significant head start of the southern forces, cavalry forces from each side met, and began skirmishing on May 4. Union General George Stoneman's cavalry encountered and began skirmishing with Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry, the Confederate's rearguard. Learning of this, and frustrated by the slow progress of his own forces which were passing through Williamsburg, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston detached a portion of his troops to confront the advancing Union troops. On May 5, 1862, the single-day Battle of Williamsburg took place. During the day, several groups of Union troops battled with Confederates near the Williamsburg line, with much of the action at or near Fort Magruder. Confederate casualties, including the cavalry skirmishing on May 4, were 1,682. Union casualties were 2,283. Although McClellan claimed a Union victory in his reports, and he took the Williamsburg Line within slightly more than 24 hours, most historians rate the Battle of Williamsburg as a Confederate victory. The Williamsburg Line had served its intended purpose. The primary goal of the defenders had been to enable the retreat of the main Confederate force to the defenses of Richmond, and this was accomplished. Those Union forces sent up the York River by McClellan met limited success in stopping fleeing rebels. Their conflict on May 7 became known as the Battle of Eltham's Landing. That conflict in New Kent County was little more than a heavy skirmish, resulting in 194 Union casualties and 48 Confederate. The remaining battles of McClellan's campaign were fought either outside the gates of Richmond or during his later retreat to the protection of the Union Navy at Harrison's Landing (better known in modern times as Berkley Plantation). In the areas along the Williamsburg Line, including the Quarterpath Road north of modern-day Virginia State Route 199 and along U.S. Route 60, portions of the redoubts were preserved. This includes the core of Fort Magruder (in James City County on today's Penniman Road). Several additional preserved redoubts remain along the Colonial Parkway north of Fort Magruder. Williamsburg: the closest center of commerce Located along a ridge of higher ground along the Virginia Peninsula midway between the York and James rivers, Williamsburg had been established in the early 17th century as a fortified settlement known as Middle Plantation. During the American Revolutionary War, under the leadership of Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson, the capital of Virginia was relocated many miles inland to Richmond, at the fall line on the James River. Although the Quarterpath Road led to the James River at Burwell's Landing, (as did the old Jamestown Road), to reach the landings and the river were significant distances in the era before railroads or motor vehicles. Also, in differing directions by land from Williamsburg, and at a shorter distance, persons could get to other landings on the College Creek or Queen's Creek, which led to the very navigable portions of the James and York rivers, respectively. The distances to navigable water from Williamsburg were obstacles that inhibited trade and put the town into lesser position compared to communities with better water access. An early plan to establish a relatively short canal to enable shipping to Williamsburg from either or both of the navigable waterways a dozen or less miles nearby was initiated. Some construction was undertaken, but was never completed. The proposed canal instead became a little-known footnote in Williamsburg's history. As the town did not have ready access to a major waterway nor transportation pathway, throughout the formative years of the United States, Williamsburg did not develop as a major center of commerce of any great significance. For at least 140 years after 1781, Williamsburg was best known as the home of the often struggling College of William and Mary (established by Royal Charter by England's only joint monarchy in 1693). It also had the first mental asylum in what became the United States, a pioneering institution which modern successor became known as Eastern State Hospital. Williamsburg seemed somewhat forgotten and \\"passed by,\\" and was the subject of occasional humor along those lines. On June 26, 1912, the Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper ran an editorial which dubbed the town 'Lotusburg' for \\"Tuesday was election day in Williamsburg but nobody remembered it. The clerk forgot to wake the electoral board, the electoral board could not arouse itself long enough to have the ballots printed, the candidates forgot they were running, the voters forgot they were alive.\\" WPA_Guide: Colonial Williamsburg: The Corporate Town-Before . Xroads.virginia.edu (1912-06-26). Retrieved on 2011-06-02. In the early 1880s, through the vision and efforts of railroad builder and industrialist Collis P. Huntington and his associates, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) had been extended from Richmond through Williamsburg to reach Newport News Point, at the confluence of the James and the Elizabeth rivers in Warwick County, where coal shipping facilities were established. Soon, a town quickly developed as the City of Newport News in 1896. A great shipyard, which became Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company was also established there. The railroad had been built primarily as a transportation line to enable shipping of bituminous coal from the rich coalfields of southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia. But it also connected Williamsburg, as well as James City and Warwick counties, with the expanding transcontinental railroads of the country. Passenger and freight services were provided, and stations were built along the line, including one at Grove Station, a few miles north and east of Kingsmill near the adjacent Carter's Grove Plantation at Grove, Virginia. Carter's Grove Plantation and Carter's Grove Wharf were the next major feature immediately east of Kinsgmill along the north bank of the James River. Carter's Grove was still an active plantation in the early 20th century, but the Kingsmill Plantation and surrounding properties had fallen into ruins and disuse. With much of it primarily both wooded and hilly, the land at Kingsmill was not particularly well-suited to agriculture. It stood largely vacant and unused as major changes began at Williamsburg and the nearby region beginning in 1926. Colonial Williamsburg In the first half of the 20th century, much of the property in the area of the old Kingsmill Plantation was acquired by Standard Oil heir John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his associates and by Colonial Williamsburg. Championed initially by the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, who was affiliated with both Bruton Parish Church (which he helped restore in 1907 in time for the Jamestown Exposition), and working with the College of William and Mary's president at the time, J.A.C. Chandler, the Colonial Williamsburg project was funded and endowed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., along with his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. The Rockefellers officially developed Colonial Williamsburg to celebrate the patriots and the early history of the United States. Many of the missing Colonial structures were reconstructed on their original sites during the 1930s. Others were restored to estimates of 18th- century appearance, with traces of later buildings and improvements removed. Dependency structures and animals add to the ambiance. Most buildings are open for tourists, with the exception of buildings serving as residences for Colonial Williamsburg employees. Notable structures include the Capitol and the Governor's Palace, each recreated and landscaped as to what is known of their late 18th-century condition, as well as Bruton Parish Church and the Raleigh Tavern. The Wren Building on the campus of William and Mary was one of the first buildings to be restored. The Rockefellers had many homes in New York and Maine. However, it was not long before the couple came to regard Williamsburg as their favorite and the town as one in which they felt \\"at home\\" according to statements to that effect made by their children and grandchildren. This is also evidenced by many of their actions as well as those of their family and other members of the patriarch of the Rockefeller family who have continued the sentiment. Their love and concern for the citizenry of the area may be shown in many ways which extend beyond the principal missions and direct accomplishments of Colonial Williamsburg. Notable among these was Abby's efforts to facilitate educational opportunities for persons of African-American heritage during a very difficult period for such efforts in Virginia, notably her role with the establishment of the Bruton Heights School complex, which went far to equalize educational opportunities for blacks in the Greater Williamsburg community many years before judicial rulings and governmental mandates brought similar efforts elsewhere. At the urging of Dr. Goodwin, John and Abby Rockefeller made their home at Bassett Hall, between the northern end of the historic Quarterpath Road and the southeastern edge of the Historic District. Their funds helped acquire vast tracts of land throughout the area, including property which extended east to include the old Kingsmill Plantation. It has been said that they had dreams of acquiring one of the old working James River plantations still extant in their lifetimes, but that goal eluded them. In the late 1920s Rockefeller had attempted to acquire Shirley, long the seat of the Carter family, halfway between Richmond and Williamsburg, that he felt was the ideal plantation with which to supplement the historical messages of the colonial capital he was restoring. Though its owners were much reduced in circumstances, the plantation wasn't for sale. The Carters did, however, agree, in 1928, to sell a Charles Willson Peale portrait of General Washington that they owned to Rockefeller for the sum of $75,000 (equal to approximately $1 million in 2015). After Abby and John D. Rockefeller Jr. had each died, beginning in the 1960s, their son Winthrop Rockefeller served as chairman of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. He was also governor of the state of Arkansas. During his dual tenures, he became aware of an opportunity to acquire Carter's Grove Plantation, adjacent to Colonial Williamsburg's extensive holdings near the old Kingsmill Plantation lands, and still extant as both a home and working farm. Also established by a Burwell (in 1755), Carter's Grove had most recently been owned since 1928 by Pittsburgh industrialist Archibald McCrea and his wife Mary \\"Mollie\\" Corling (Johnston) Dunlop McCrea, originally of Petersburg. It was purchased from her estate by an arm of the Rockefeller Foundation and eventually transferred to the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. For many years during Winthrop's tenure, Carter's Grove was used to host dignitaries visiting Colonial Williamsburg, as well as enable archaeological research as well as host some public presentations for Colonial Williamsburg patrons. Additionally, while serving as both Governor of Arkansas and chairman of Colonial Williamsburg, Winthrop learned that Anheuser-Busch head August Busch, II was considering establishing a brewery and possibly other developmental investments in eastern Virginia. While the details are unknown publicly, he and Bush apparently collaborated on a deal which resulted in the brewing conglomerate's development of diversified activities in the Williamsburg area, which grew to include not only the brewery, but the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park, and Kingsmill Resort, the Kingsmill on the James residential planned community, and several large commercial parks. To help negotiate the deal, the land which had once been Kingsmill Plantation was made available for purchase. Along with the later acquisition of smaller nearby water park, the A-B developments this fostered in the Williamsburg community generated thousands of new jobs and millions of dollars of new tax revenues. Both Winthrop Rockefeller, who died in 1973, and August Busch II, who died in 1989 have been credited by some historians with helping develop the Greater Williamsburg area into one of the top tourism destinations in the world. They apparently felt that augmenting the attractions of the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia (Jamestown, Colonial Williamsburg, and Yorktown) with other attractions would help draw future families to the region, as well as help balance out the local economy, stimulate the hospitality industry (restaurants and lodging), and add employment opportunities. Due to operational logistics, Carter's Grove Plantation was eventually sold (with restrictive covenants regarding use and future development) by Colonial Williamsburg. The global economy also eventually resulted in A-B setting out to divest its theme parks, the resort and other developments to new ownership. 21st century: Kingsmill area As of 2013, Colonial Williamsburg and the developments initiated by the Rockefellers and Busch family, continued to provide Williamsburg, James City County, and much of the surrounding area with a substantial base of employment and economic activity.

It was launched in 1987 by Cliff Biggers and Ward Batty, both of whom have continued to edit it.  History  In 1982, Biggers and Batty became co-owners of a Marietta, Georgia, comic shop, Dr. No's, for which Biggers began writing a newsletter, The Doctor Knows. Realizing there was a market for an upbeat, product-focused store newsletter, they started Comic Shop News. At the time, DC, Marvel and other publishers were selling their own newsletters in bundles to comic shops. Using that distribution technique, CSN is sold in bundles to comic shops who distribute free to customers as a sales tool and to reward weekly visits. CSN grew to become the largest-circulation weekly in the comic book industry, and still continues as a weekly publication with over 1,400 issues published to date and over 130 million copies sold. CSN is available in over 400 comic shops worldwide, but mostly in North America. CSN was originally four black-and-white pages but expanded to eight pages and full color. While CSN is primarily a news source, some original comics content has also been featured. In addition to Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the currently-running Spider-Man newspaper strips, Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Avon Oeming long-running comic, Powers was initially previewed in a series of original strips. The eight strips were colored and lettered by Bendis (before initial colorist/letterer Pat Garrahy became involved) and complemented the upcoming series as a companion piece in newspaper strip form. The strips were collected in the Powers: The Definitive Hardcover Collection vol. 1. A mock version of Comic Shop News was featured in the opening credits of the film Chasing Amy.

It was supposedly founded by Saint Landry in 651 AD, making it the oldest hospital in the city and the oldest worldwide still operating. The Hôtel-Dieu was the only hospital in the city until the Renaissance. While the old Hôtel-Dieu stood by the Seine on the opposite side of the parvise, it was ravaged by fire several times, and was rebuilt for the last time at its present location between 1867 and 1878, as part of Haussmann's renovation of Paris. Nowadays operated by Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), the Hôtel-Dieu is also a teaching hospital associated with the Faculté de Médecine Paris-Descartes. History The old Hôtel-Dieu Episodes from the Life of a Bishop-Saint, by the Master of Saint Giles (), showing the Gothic buildings of the old Hôtel-Dieu at right The Hôtel-Dieu was supposedly founded by Saint Landry in 651 AD, but its first recorded mention only dates back to 829. It is nonetheless considered to be the oldest hospital in the city and the oldest worldwide still operating. The history of Parisian hospitals dates from the Middle Ages. Poverty was widespread during that period, and the Hôtel-Dieu became an opportunity for many of the bourgeois and nobility to come to its aid. Their efforts allowed the construction of the Hôpital de la Charité, which linked piety and medical care. Like many hospitals of that era, it started as a general institution catering for the poor and sick, offering food and shelter in addition to medical care. The creation of the Hôtel-Dieu continued this tradition of charity up until the 19th century, despite being called into question during the centuries which followed. Old Hôtel-Dieu on the map of Truschet and Hoyau In the 16th century the Hôtel-Dieu faced a financial crisis, as it was financed only by help, subsidies or privileges. This brought about the creation in 1505 of a council of laymen governors: the Presidents of Parliament, the Chambre des Comptes, the Cour des Aides and the Prévôt des Marchands. during the same century, Henry IV built Hôpital Saint-Louis to unclog the Hotel Dieu. The 17th century elite created establishments to house the poor. Hospitals thus took the name of \\"Hôpital Général\\" (General hospital) or \\"Hôpital d'enfermement\\" (Asylum), of which the Hôtel-Dieu was one. The centralized approach to extreme poverty in France was based on the premise that medical care was a right for those without family or income, and formalized the admission process in hospitals to prevent overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. The Lieutenant Général de Police became a member of the Bureau de l’Hôtel-Dieu de Paris (Bureau for the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris) in 1690. The hospital extended across the river with building of the Rosary House surmounting the Pont au Double. Old Hôtel-Dieu on the Turgot map Painting by Victor-Jean Nicolle In the 18th century, Paris hospitals in general were characterized with poor sanitation and treatment followed by high mortality rate. As Jacques Tenon would note in his Mémoires sur les hôpitaux de Paris (1788), the sanitary conditions were horrendous, facilities were overcrowded and there was a high mortality rate in these hospitals. The Hôtel-Dieu was \\"the most unhealthy and uncomfortable of all hospitals\\", with a mortality rate of almost 25 percent. Even though it was the largest of Paris' hospitals with 1,200 beds, many beds held three or more patients—women gave birth in shared beds and there was no separation amongst patients with contagious diseases. The 1,200 beds in the hospital were completely inadequate for housing its over 3,500 patients. The fire of the Hôtel-Dieu in 1772, depicted by Jean-Baptiste- François Génillion In 1772 a fire destroyed a large part of the Hôtel-Dieu. This event sparked discussions over the conditions and possible reforms that would be made to the hospital system. Louis XV ordered the demolition of the Hôtel-Dieu in 1773 after hearing of its poor patient conditions. The execution of the order was however delayed due to the King's death, and Louis XVI, who succeeded him, was persuaded of an alternate plan to reconstruct the damaged parts of the hospital. This scheme was submitted to the Academy of Sciences for review, and debate regarding Hôtel-Dieu extended until 1785 as it transformed into discussions about the reformation of Paris's hospital system. Conditions enhanced in 1787, when the Hôtel-Dieu implemented a code of medical services that shifted the hospital from a curing machine run by nuns to a medical and surgical establishment run by doctors. Jacques Necker created the positions of Inspecteur général des hôpitaux civils et des maisons de force (General Inspector for civil hospitals and jails) and Commissaire du roi pour tout ce qui a trait aux hôpitaux (Royal Commissioner for all that relates to hospitals). Pierre-Joseph Desault and Xavier Bichat In the meantime, the Hôtel-Dieu had received a high status as a surgical training institution with the appointment of Pierre-Joseph Desault as chef de service in 1785. Desault established an elaborate educational program for surgical interns when previously they had only informal training. By the 19th century hospitals had become places of teaching and medical research in addition to practicing medicine. Xavier Bichat, a pupil of Desault, expounded on his new \\"membrane theory\\" during a course taught in 1801–1802 at the Hôtel-Dieu. thumb In 1801, the Parisian hospitals adopted a new administrative framework: the Conseil général des hôpitaux et hospices civils de Paris (General Council for Parisian hospitals and civil hospices). This willingness to improve management brought about the creation of new services: the Bureau d'admission (Admissions office) and the Pharmacie centrale (Central Pharmacy). Napoleon I finally rebuilt the portions of the Hôtel-Dieu which had burnt in 1772. Also during this period, the Hôtel-Dieu advocated the practice of vaccination, of which Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt was a fervent supporter. Similarly, the discoveries of René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laennec permitted the refinement of methods of diagnosis, auscultation, and aetiology of illnesses. The Pont au Double was demolished in 1847 and rebuilt without covering. Present Hôtel-Dieu Photograph by Charles Marville The Hôtel-Dieu was rebuilt between 1867 and 1878 on the opposite side of the parvise of Notre Dame, as part of Haussmann's renovation of Paris commissioned by Napoleon III. The reconstruction followed plans by architects Gilbert and Diet. It was not until 1908 that the Augustinian nuns left the Hôtel-Dieu for good. Role within the Parisian healthcare system View from Notre-Dame de Paris thumb thumb The Hôtel-Dieu is the top casualty centre to deal with emergency cases, being the only emergency centre for the first nine arrondissements and being the local centre for the first four. For the last 50 years it has been home to the diabetes and endocrine illnesses clinical department. It deals almost exclusively with the screening, treatment and prevention of the complications associated with diabetes mellitus. It is also a referral service for hypoglycemia. Oriented towards informing the patient (therapeutic education) and technological innovation, it offers a large choice of care facilities for all levels of complications. It is also at the forefront of research in diabetes in areas such as new insulins and new drugs, effects of nutrition, external and implanted pumps, glucose sensors and artificial pancreas. More recently, a major department for ophthalmology (emergencies, surgery and research) has been developed at the Hôtel-Dieu, under the supervision of Yves Pouliquen. Notable figures Notable physicians, researchers, and surgeons who practised at the hospital include Forlenze, Bichat, Dupuytren, Hartmann, Desault, Récamier, Cholmen, Dieulafoy, Trousseau, Ambroise Paré, Marc Tiffeneau, Augustin Gilbert.

Niladhvaj Khen, the first king, united several Baro-Bhuyan chieftains of the area and removed the last of Arimatta's successors—Mriganka. There were only three Khen rulers. The last king, Nilambar expanded the kingdom to include the present Koch Bihar districts of West Bengal and the undivided Kamrup and Darrang districts of Assam and northern Mymensing in Bangladesh as well as eastern parts of Dinajpur district, though he was removed by Alauddin Husain Shah in 1498. According to the Gosani Mangala (1823), the Khen rulers had a humble origin, implying that they were local indigenous chieftains. They worshiped Kamatashwari (also called Chandi or Bhavani), thus providing a break from the earlier dynasties that drew their lineage from Narakasura, the son of Vishnu i.e Bhauma dynasty which can be explained by Kachari(Bara) folklore. The Khen rulers were of Kheng-Bhutanese stock from the mountains. Possibly non-Aryan in origin, it was only the decline of the Kamarupa kings which allowed them to blossom into a powerful entity in their own right from their former position as local chieftains. The Khen dynasty finally fell to Alauddin Husain Shah in 1498. But Hussein Shah could not rule the kingdom--Bhuyan chiefs of the region, with the help of the Ahom king, Suhungmung, defeated the invaders in 1505.

Initially the Germans were perceived by most Estonians as liberators from the USSR and its repressions, having arrived only a week after the first mass deportations from the Baltic States. Although hopes were raised for the restoration of the country's independence, it was soon realized that they were but another occupying power. The Germans pillaged the country for their war effort and unleashed The Holocaust in Estonia during which they and their collaborators murdered tens of thousands of people (including ethnic Estonians, Estonian Jews, Estonian Gypsies, Estonian Russians, Soviet prisoners of war, Jews from other countries and others). For the duration of the occupation, Estonia was incorporated into the German province of Ostland. Occupation German advance in Latvia, Estonia and on the Leningrad front from June to December 1941 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. Three days later, on June 25, Finland declared herself to once again be in a state of war with the USSR, starting the Continuation War. On July 3, Joseph Stalin made his public statement over the radio calling for scorched-earth policy in the areas to be abandoned. Because the northernmost areas of the Baltic states were the last to be reached by the Germans, it was here that the Soviet destruction battalions had their most extreme effects. The Estonian forest brothers, numbering about 50,000, inflicted heavy casualties on the remaining Soviets; as many as 4,800 were killed and 14,000 captured. Even though the Germans did not cross the Estonian southern border until July 7–9, Estonian soldiers who had deserted from Soviet units in large numbers, opened fire on the Red Army as early as June 22. On that day, a group of forest brothers attacked Soviet trucks on a road in the district of Harju.Chris Bellamy. The Absolute War. Soviet Russia in the Second World War, page 197. Vintage Books, New York 2008. The Soviet 22nd Rifle Corps was the unit that lost most men, as a large group of Estonian soldiers and officers deserted from it. Furthermore, border guards of Soviet Estonia were mostly people who had previously worked for independent Estonia, and they also escaped to the forests, becoming one of the best groups of Estonian fighters. An Estonian writer Juhan Jaik wrote in 1941: \\"These days bogs and forests are more populated than farms and fields. The forests and bogs are our territory while the fields and farms are occupied by the enemy [e.g. the Soviets]\\". The 8th Army (Major General Ljubovtsev), retreated in front of the 2nd corps of the German Army behind the Pärnu River - the Emajõgi River line on July 12. As German troops approached Tartu on July 10 and prepared for another battle with the Soviets, they realized that the Estonian partisans were already fighting the Soviet troops. The Wehrmacht stopped its advance and hung back, leaving the Estonians to do the fighting. The battle of Tartu lasted two weeks, and destroyed most of the city. Under the leadership of Friedrich Kurg, the Estonian partisans drove out the Soviets from Tartu on their own. In the meanwhile, the Soviets had been murdering citizens held in Tartu Prison, killing 192 before the Estonians captured the city. At the end of July the Germans resumed their advance in Estonia working in tandem with the Estonian Forest Brothers. Both German troops and Estonian partisans took Narva on August 17 and the Estonian capital Tallinn on August 28. On that day, the Soviet flag shot down earlier on Pikk Hermann was replaced with the Flag of Estonia by Fred Ise. After the Soviets were driven out from Estonia, German troops disarmed all the partisan groups. The Estonian flag was soon replaced with the flag of Nazi Germany, and the 2,000 Estonian soldiers that took part in the parade in Tartu (July 29), were disbanded.Chris Bellamy. The Absolute War. Soviet Russia in the Second World War, page 198. Vintage Books, New York 2008. Most Estonians greeted the Germans with relatively open arms and hoped for the restoration of independence. Estonia set up an administration, led by Jüri Uluots as soon as the Soviet regime retreated and before German troops arrived. Estonian partisans that drove the Red Army from Tartu made it possible. That all was for nothing since the Germans had made their plans as set out in Generalplan Ost, they disbanded the provisional government and Estonia became a part of the German-occupied \\"Ostland\\". A Sicherheitspolizei was established for internal security under the leadership of Ain-Ervin Mere. In April 1941, on the eve on the German invasion, Alfred Rosenberg, Reich minister for the Occupied Eastern territories, a Baltic German, born and raised in Tallinn, Estonia, laid out his plans for the East. According to Rosenberg a future policy was created: # Germanization (Eindeutschung) of the \\"racially suitable\\" elements. # Colonization by Germanic people. # Exile, deportations of undesirable elements. Rosenberg felt that the \\"Estonians were the most Germanic out of the people living in the Baltic area, having already reached 50 percent of Germanization through Danish, Swedish and German influence\\". Non-suitable Estonians were to be moved to a region that Rosenberg called \\"Peipusland\\" to make room for German colonists. The removal of 50% of Estonians was in accordance with the Nazi Generalplan Ost plan, the elimination of all Jews, was just the start. The initial enthusiasm that accompanied the liberation from Soviet occupation quickly waned as a result and the Germans had limited success in recruiting volunteers. The draft was introduced in 1942, resulting in some 3400 men fleeing to Finland to fight in the Finnish Army rather than join the Germans. Finnish Infantry Regiment 200 (Estonian: soomepoisid 'boys of Finland') was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland. With the Allied victory over Germany becoming certain in 1944, the only option to save Estonia's independence was to stave off a new Soviet invasion of Estonia until Germany's capitulation. Political resistance Jüri Uluots In June 1942 political leaders of Estonia who had survived Soviet repressions held a hidden meeting from the occupying powers in Estonia where the formation of an underground Estonian government and the options for preserving continuity of the republic were discussed.Chronology at the EIHC On January 6, 1943 a meeting was held at the Estonian foreign delegation in Stockholm. It was decided that, in order to preserve the legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia, the last constitutional prime minister, Jüri Uluots, must continue to fulfill his responsibilities as prime minister.Mälksoo, Lauri (2000). Professor Uluots, the Estonian Government in Exile and the Continuity of the Republic of Estonia in International Law. Nordic Journal of International Law 69.3, 289–316. In June 1944 the elector's assembly of the Republic of Estonia gathered in secrecy from the occupying powers in Tallinn and appointed Jüri Uluots as the prime minister with the responsibilities of the President. On June 21 Jüri Uluots appointed Otto Tief as deputy prime minister. As the Germans retreated, on September 18, 1944 Jüri Uluots formed a government led by the Deputy Prime Minister, Otto Tief. On September 20 the Nazi German flag on Pikk Hermann was replaced with the tricolor flag of Estonia. On September 22 the Red Army took Tallinn and the Estonian flag on Pikk Hermann was replaced with the Soviet flag. The Estonian underground government, not officially recognized by either the Nazi Germany or Soviet Union, fled to Stockholm, Sweden and operated in exile until 1992, when Heinrich Mark, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia in duties of the President in exile, presented his credentials to the newly elected President of Estonia Lennart Meri. On February 23, 1989 the flag of the Estonian SSR had been lowered on Pikk Hermann; it was replaced with the flag of Estonia to mark Estonian Independence Day on February 24, 1989. Estonians in Nazi German military units The annexation of Estonia by the USSR in 1940 was complete, but never recognized internationally except by Eastern Bloc countries. After the annexation, Estonians were subject to conscription into the Red Army, which by international law is illegal if Estonia is not considered to have been a part of the USSR. When the Soviets retreated from Estonia and Germany fully occupied it, in the summer of 1941, the Germans continued the practice of dragooning Estonian men, although the majority joined the German Army voluntarily, often out of the desire to fight the USSR, which had made strong enemies with many groups of society in Estonia after introducing their Marxist economic system. Up to March 1942 drafted Estonians mostly served in the rear of the Army Group North security. On August 28, 1942 the German powers announced the legal compilation of the so-called \\"Estonian Legion\\" within the Waffen SS. Oberführer Franz Augsberger was nominated the commander of the legion. Up to the end of 1942 about 1,280 men volunteered into the training camp. Bataillon Narwa was formed from the first 800 men of the Legion to have finished their training at Heidelager, being sent in April 1943 to join the Division Wiking in Ukraine. They replaced the Finnish Volunteer Battalion, recalled to Finland for political reasons.Estonian Vikings: Estnisches SS-Freiwilligen Bataillon Narwa and Subsequent Units, Eastern Front, 1943–1944. In March 1943, a partial mobilization was carried out in Estonia during which 12,000 men were conscripted into the SS. On May 5, 1943 the 3rd Waffen-SS Brigade (Estonian), another fully Estonian unit, was formed and sent to the front near Nevel. Divisional insignia of 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) By January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Red Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. Jüri Uluots, the last constitutional Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia, the leader of Estonian underground government delivered a radio address on February 7 that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service in the SS (before this, Uluots had opposed any German mobilization of Estonians.) Following Uluots' address, 38.000 conscripts jammed registration centers. Several thousand Estonians who had volunteered to join the Finnish army were transferred back across the Gulf of Finland to join the newly formed Territorial Defense Force, assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance. The maximum amount of Estonians enrolled in Nazi-German military units was 70,000. The initial formation of the volunteer Estonian Legion created in 1942 was eventually expanded to become a full-sized conscript division of the Waffen SS in 1944, the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian). Units consisting largely of Estonians — often under German officers – saw action on the Narva line throughout 1944. Many Estonians hoped that they would attract support from the Allies, and ultimately a restoration of their interwar independence, by resisting the Soviet reoccupation of their country.The Baltic States: The National Self-Determination of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Graham Smith, p. 91, . In the end, there was no Allied support, largely because they were fighting under Nazi flags. On February 2, 1944 the advance guard units of the 2nd Shock Army reached the border of Estonia as a part of the Kingisepp–Gdov Offensive which began on February 1. Field Marshal Walter Model was nominated the leader of the German Army Group North. The Soviet Narva Offensive (15–28 February 1944) led by Soviet General Leonid A. Govorov, the commander of the Leningrad Front, commenced. On February 24, Estonian Independence Day, the counterattack of the so-called Estonian Division to break the Soviet bridgeheads began. A battalion of Estonians led by Rudolf Bruus destroyed a Soviet bridgehead. Another battalion of Estonians led by Ain-Ervin Mere was successful against another bridgehead, at Vaasa-Siivertsi-Vepsaküla. On March 6, this work was complete. The Leningrad Front concentrated 9 corps at Narva against 7 divisions and one brigade. On March 1, the Soviet Narva Offensive (1–4 March 1944) began in the direction of Auvere. The 658th Eastern Battalion led by Alfons Rebane and the 659th Eastern Battalion commanded by Georg Sooden were involved in defeating the operation. On March 17, twenty Soviet divisions again unsuccessfully attacked the three divisions in Auvere. On April 7, the leadership of the Red Army ordered to go on the defensive. In March the Soviets committed bombing attacks towards the towns of Estonia, including the bombing of Tallinn on March 9. On July 24 the Soviets began the new Narva Offensive (July 1944) in the direction of Auvere. The 1st battalion (Stubaf Paul Maitla) of the 45th Regiment led by Harald Riipalu and the fusiliers (previously \\"Narva\\"), under the leadership of Hatuf Hando Ruus, were involved in repelling the attack. Finally, Narva was evacuated and a new front was settled on the Tannenberg Line in the Sinimäed Hills. On the first of August the Finnish government and President Ryti were to resign. On the next day, Aleksander Warma, the Estonian Ambassador to Finland (1939–1940 (1944)) announced that the National Committee of the Estonian Republic had sent a telegram, which requested the Estonian volunteer regiment to be returned to Estonia fully equipped. On the following day, the Finnish Government received a letter from the Estonians. It had been signed in the name of \\"all national organizations of Estonia\\" by Aleksander Warma, Karl Talpak and several others, seconding the request. It was then announced that the regiment would be disbanded and that the volunteers were free to return home. An agreement had been reached with the Germans, and the Estonians were promised amnesty if they chose to return and fight in the SS. As soon as they landed, the regiment was sent to perform a counter-attack against the Soviet 3rd Baltic Front, which had managed a breakthrough on the Tartu front, and was threatening the capital Tallinn. After an attempt to break through the Tannenberg Line failed, the main struggle was carried to the south of Lake Peipus, where on August 11, Petseri was taken and Võru on August 13. Near Tartu, the 3rd Baltic Front was stopped by the Kampfgruppe \\"Wagner\\" which involved military groups sent from Narva under the command of Alfons Rebane and Paul Vent and the 5th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Wallonien led by Léon Degrelle. On August 19, 1944 Jüri Uluots, in a radio broadcast, called for the Red Army to hold back and a peace agreement to be reached. As Finland left the war on September 4, 1944 according to their peace agreement with the USSR, the defence of the mainland became practically impossible and the German command decided to retreat from Estonia. Resistance against the Soviets continued in the Moonsund Archipelago until November 23, 1944, when the Germans evacuated the Sõrve Peninsula. According to the Soviet data, the conquest of the territory of Estonia cost them 126,000 casualties. Some disregard the official figures and argue that a more realistic number is 480,000 for the Battle of Narva only, considering the intensity of the fighting at the front. On the German side, their own data shows 30,000 dead, which some have similarly seen as underrated, preferring at the minimum 45,000. German administrators In 1941 Estonia was occupied by German troops and after a brief period of military rule — dependent of the Commanders of the Army Group North (in the occupied U.S.S.R.) — a German civilian administration was established and Estonia was organized as a General Kommissariat becoming soon afterwards part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland.

Marked \\"Secret Reich Matter,\\" the map shows the number of Jews shot in Ostland, and reads at the bottom: \\"the estimated number of Jews still on hand is 128,000\\". Estonia is marked as judenfrei.The process of Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the 19th century, when in 1865 Alexander II of Russia granted them the right to enter the region. The creation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 marked the beginning of a new era for the Jews. Approximately 200 Jews fought in combat for the creation of the Republic of Estonia and 70 of these men were volunteers. From the very first days of her existence as a state, Estonia showed her tolerance towards all the peoples inhabiting her territories. On 12 February 1925 the Estonian government passed a law pertaining to the cultural autonomy of minority peoples. The Jewish community quickly prepared its application for cultural autonomy. Statistics on Jewish citizens were compiled. They totaled 3,045, fulfilling the minimum requirement of 3000 for cultural autonomy. In June 1926 the Jewish Cultural Council was elected and Jewish cultural autonomy was declared. Jewish cultural autonomy was of great interest to global Jewish community. The Jewish National Endowment presented the Estonian government with a certificate of gratitude for this achievement. There were, at the time of Soviet occupation in 1940, approximately 4000 Estonian Jews. The Jewish Cultural Autonomy was immediately abolished. Jewish cultural institutions were closed down. Many of Jewish people were deported to Siberia along with other Estonians by the Soviets. It is estimated that 350–500 Jews suffered this fate.Weiss-Wendt, Anton (1998). The Soviet Occupation of Estonia in 1940–41 and the Jews. Holocaust and Genocide Studies 12.2, 308–25.Berg, Eiki (1994). The Peculiarities of Jewish Settlement in Estonia. GeoJournal 33.4, 465–70.The Holocaust in the Baltics About three-fourths of Estonian Jewry managed to leave the country during this period.Estonia Out the approximately 4,300 Jews in Estonia prior to the war, almost 1000 were entrapped by the Nazis.Birn, Ruth Bettina (2001), Collaboration with Nazi Germany in Eastern Europe: the Case of the Estonian Security Police. Contemporary European History 10.2, 181–98. Round-ups and killings of Jews began immediately following the arrival of the first German troops in 1941, who were closely followed by the extermination squad Sonderkommando 1a under Martin Sandberger, part of Einsatzgruppe A led by Walter Stahlecker. Arrests and executions continued as the Germans, with the assistance of local collaborators, advanced through Estonia. Holocaust memorial at the site of the former Klooga concentration camp, opened on 24th July 2005 Unlike German forces, some support apparently existed among an undefined segment of the local collaborators for anti-Jewish actions. The standard form used for the cleansing operations was arrest 'because of communist activity'. The equation between Jews and communists evoked a positive response among some Estonians. Estonians often argued that their Jewish colleagues and friends were not communists and submitted proofs of pro-Estonian conduct in hope to get them released. Estonia was declared Judenfrei quite early by the German occupation regime at the Wannsee Conference. Jews that had remained in Estonia (921 according to Martin Sandberger, 929 according to Evgenia Goorin-Loov and 963 according to Walter Stahlecker) were killed.Communism and Crimes against Humanity in the Baltic states Fewer than a dozen Estonian Jews are known to have survived the war in Estonia. The Nazi regime also established 22 concentration and labor camps on occupied Estonian territory for foreign Jews. The largest, Vaivara concentration camp housed 1,300 prisoners at a time. These prisoners were mainly Jews, with smaller groups of Russians, Dutch, and Estonians.Vaivara Several thousand foreign Jews were killed at the Kalevi-Liiva camp. Four Estonians most responsible for the murders at Kalevi-Liiva were accused at war crimes trials in 1961. Two were later executed, while the Soviet occupation authorities were unable to press charges against two who lived in exile. There have been knowingly 7 ethnic Estonians: Ralf Gerrets, Ain-Ervin Mere, Jaan Viik, Juhan Jüriste, Karl Linnas, Aleksander Laak and Ervin Viks that have faced trials for crimes against humanity. Since the reestablishment of the Estonian independence markers were put in place for the 60th anniversary of the mass executions that were carried out at the Lagedi, Vaivara and Klooga (Kalevi-Liiva) camps in September 1944. There are three Estonians who have been honoured with The Righteous Among the Nations: Uku Masing and his wife Eha Masing and Polina Lentsman.  Estonian military units' involvement in crimes against humanity  The Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against HumanityConclusions of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity has reviewed the role of Estonian military units and police battalions in an effort to identify the role of Estonian military units and police battalions participation during World War II in crimes against humanity. The conclusions of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity are available online. It says that there is an evidence of Estonian units' involvement in crimes against humanity, and acts of genocide; however, the commission noted  Controversies  Views diverge on history of Estonia during World War II and following the occupation by Nazi Germany. *According to the Estonian point of view, the occupation of Estonia by Soviet Union lasted five decades, only interrupted by the Nazi invasion of 1941–1944.Moscow celebrations at newsfromrussia Estonian representatives at the European Parliament even made a motion for a resolution acknowledging the 48 years of occupation as a fact. The final version of the resolution of European parliament, however, only acknowledged Estonia's loss of independence lasting from 1940 to 1991 and that annexation of Estonia by Soviet Union was considered illegal by Western democracies. *The position of the Russian Government: Russia has denied that Soviet Union illegally annexed the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in 1940. The Kremlin's European affairs chief Sergei Yastrzhembsky: \\"There was no occupation.\\" Russian State officials look at the events in Estonia in the end of World War II as the liberation from fascism by the Soviet Union. *Views of World War II veteran, an Estonian Ilmar Haaviste fought on the German side: \\"Both regimes were equally evil — there was no difference between the two except that Stalin was more cunning\\". *Views of World War II veteran, an Estonian Arnold Meri fought on the Soviet side: \\"Estonia's participation in World War II was inevitable. Every Estonian had only one decision to make: whose side to take in that bloody fight — the Nazis' or the anti-Hitler coalition's.\\" *Views of World War II veteran, a Russian fought on the Soviet side in Estonia answering a question: How do you feel being called an \\"occupier\\"? \\" Viktor Andreyev: \\"Half believe one thing half believe another. That's in the run of things.\\" In 2004 controversy regarding the events of World War II in Estonia surrounded the Monument of Lihula. In April 2007 the divergent views on history of World War II in Estonia centered around the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn.

The Scottish Book () was a thick notebook used by mathematicians of the Lwów School of Mathematics in Poland for jotting down problems meant to be solved. The notebook was named after the \\"Scottish Café\\" where it was kept. Originally, the mathematicians who gathered at the cafe would write down the problems and equations directly on the cafe's marble table tops, but these would be erased at the end of each day, and so the record of the preceding discussions would be lost. The idea for the book was most likely originally suggested by Stefan Banach's wife, Łucja. Banach or Łucja purchased a large notebook and left it with the proprietor of the cafe.  History  The building of the Scottish cafe where the book was recorded and stored Mazur (left) acknowledges Per Enflo with the promised \\"live goose\\", the prize for having solved the problem 153. The Scottish Café () was the café in Lwów (now Lviv) where, in the 1930s and 1940s, mathematicians from the Lwów School collaboratively discussed research problems, particularly in functional analysis and topology. Stanislaw Ulam recounts that the tables of the café had marble tops, so they could write in pencil, directly on the table, during their discussions. To keep the results from being lost, and after becoming annoyed with their writing directly on the table tops, Stefan Banach's wife provided the mathematicians with a large notebook, which was used for writing the problems and answers and eventually became known as the Scottish Book. The book—a collection of solved, unsolved, and even probably unsolvable problems—could be borrowed by any of the guests of the café. Solving any of the problems was rewarded with prizes, with the most difficult and challenging problems having expensive prizes (during the Great Depression and on the eve of World War II), such as a bottle of fine brandy.Mauldin, ed. For problem 153, which was later recognized as being closely related to Stefan Banach's \\"basis problem\\", Stanisław Mazur offered the prize of a live goose. This problem was solved only in 1972 by Per Enflo, who was presented with the live goose in a ceremony that was broadcast throughout Poland.Mauldin, ed.; Kaluza. The café building used to house the at the street address of 27 Taras Shevchenko Prospekt. The original cafe was renovated in May 2014 and contains a copy of the Scottish Book. Problems contributed by individual authors A total of 193 problems were written down in the book. Stanisław Mazur contributed a total of 43 problems, 24 of them as a single author and 19 together with Stefan Banach. Banach himself wrote 14, plus another 11 with Stanislaw Ulam and Mazur. Ulam wrote 40 problems and additional 15 ones with others. During the Soviet occupation of Lwów, several Russian mathematicians visited the city and also added problems to the book. Hugo Steinhaus contributed the last problem on 31 May 1941, shortly before the German attack on the Soviet Union; this problem involved a question about the likely distribution of matches within a matchbox, a problem motivated by Banach's habit of chain smoking cigarettes.  Continuity  After World War II, an English translation annotated by Ulam was published by Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1957. After World War II, Steinhaus at the University of Wrocław revived the tradition of the Scottish book by initiating The New Scottish Book.

Biblical usage In biblical studies, paradiastole is a type of anaphora (the repetition of one word at the beginning of successive sentences). Paradiastole uses a few words—either, or, neither, not, and nor—used as disjunctions.Figures of Speech used in the Bible , page 2 A disjunction differs from a conjunction because it separates things, whereas a conjunction joins them. An example of this technique can be found in the Gospel of John, clarifying the meaning of τέκνα θεοῦ (God's children): :οἳ [πιστεύοντες] :οὐκ ἐξ αἱμάτων :οὐδὲ ἐκ θελήματος σαρκὸς :οὐδὲ ἐκ θελήματος ἀνδρὸς :ἀλλ' ἐκ θεοῦ ἐγεννήθησαν.

In this passage, οὐκ and οὐδὲ (here translated not and nor) function as the disjunctions. The paradiastole emphasizes that those who believed (οἳ πιστεύοντες) and became \\"God's children\\" were not physically (\\"of blood\\", etc.) born again, but divinely.

He was born in Gujranwala.  Civil service career  Gauhar entered the Civil Service of Pakistan in 1948. Starting his career as Secretary, State Bank of Pakistan, he rose to be Information Secretary Government of Pakistan at the age of 39, During his tenure, draconian laws governing the press were passed, something for which Gauhar later publicly apologised. He was, however, a gifted writer and became very close to President Ayub Khan, so much so that he was known as the de facto vice President of Pakistan. He was the main ghost writer for the latter's autobiography entitled Friends Not Masters, published 1967. Subsequently, he also wrote the biography, Ayub Khan : Pakistan's First Military Ruler, which gave a different story altogether because it was written after the death of his old mentor prompting people to question 'who is the real Ayub?'Who is the real Ayub Khan?, A G Noorani, Frontline, Volume 24 – Issue 11 :: 02–15 Jun. 2007 The last official act of President Ayub Khan before handing over power was to invite Altaf Gauhar to lunch with his family and bestow on him the high civil award of Hilal-i-Quaid-i-Azam. Through some palace intrigues, President Yahya Khan assumed power on 25 March 1969. A day or two before that he had had a serious altercation with Altaf Gauhar who wanted Ayub Khan to continue. In 1969, Gauhar was initially marginalized as Director Finance Services Academy Lahore, a position much lower in rank than a Central Secretary. Subsequently, he was dismissed from service and all his four civil awards were forfeited.  Post civil service career  On leaving the civil service in 1969, he became editor of the Pakistani daily newspaper Dawn. Later, when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was chief martial law administrator, he was twice imprisoned. It was while in jail, that Gauhar became deeply absorbed by the Quran, from which he was later to make several distinguished translations, the last one shortly before he died, when he was in great pain and undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.https://www.amazon.com/dp/0906041961 On release from prison, he left Dawn for London and launched the journals Third World Review and Third World Quarterly (in association with The Guardian newspaper), South magazine, and established the Third World Foundation. After BCCI went into liquidation, he returned to Pakistan, and continued into journalism. He poured all his energies into the role of editor-in-chief of the Muslim.Obituary in The Guardian by Michael Simmons  Death  Latterly, Gauhar restricted himself to an occasional column in the newspaper The Muslim, but left the newspaper when its editor, ABS Jaffery, was sacked by the owner. In Pakistan, on his death, he was commemorated as \\"a very eminent Pakistani\\", a man who knew power and how it could be used or abused. Gauhar died of cancer on 14 November 2000 at the age of 77 years.  Bibliography  Urdu *Nai Bengali afsanai, 1955. Translation of modern short stories from the Bengali language. *Teḥrīren̲ cand, 1995.

A third round selection by the Kansas City Chiefs from Nicholls State University, he had 39 career interceptions and was selected to participate in three Pro Bowls. College career Barbaro played just one year of high school football at East Jefferson High School in Metarie, Louisiana, instead spending most of his high school years playing trombone in the marching and jazz band. In 1971, he was recruited to play college football at Nicholls State University, which had recently added football that year. Originally a quarterback, Barbaro suffered from a sore arm and switched over to defensive back in his junior year. He was named All-Conference in 1975, helping Nicholls State to an 8–2 record and being selected to play in the Senior Bowl. He is a member of the school's Athletic Hall of Fame and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career Barbaro was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the 1976 NFL Draft, becoming the first player in Nicholls State history ever to be selected in the NFL Draft. Replacing previous starter Mike Sensibaugh, Barbaro was mentored by defensive backs coach Tom Bettis, who taught him how to become a more efficient free safety. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound Barbaro spent seven seasons with the Chiefs, earning Pro Bowl honors following the 1980, 1981, and 1982 seasons. In 1976, Barbaro was named second team All-NFL rookie team and won the Mack Lee Hill Award for best rookie in the Chiefs organization. In 1977, he had eight interceptions and led the NFL in interception return yards with 165, 102 of which he set in a December 1977 game against the Seattle Seahawks. That day, Barbaro intercepted a pass thrown by Jim Zorn in the end zone and returned it 102 yards for a touchdown, which, at the time broke an NFL record and is currently the Chiefs single-game record for longest interception return. In 1979, Barbaro intercepted seven passes and was the first ever honoree of the Kansas City Chiefs Most Valuable Player award. In 1980, he finished second in the league in interceptions with 10, behind Lester Hayes's 13, and was named second team 1980 All-NFL by The Sporting News and second team All-Pro by the Associated Press. In 1981 Barbaro had five interceptions for 134 yards while he was named first team All-Pro by the Pro Football Writers Association. In November 1983, after sitting out the entire NFL season in a contract dispute, Barbaro signed a three-year contract with the New Jersey Generals of the USFL. In his only USFL season (1984), he was named to The Sporting News USFL All-Star Team. Barbaro tore his ACL in his left knee earlier in the season and missed four games, came back to play in the Generals' July 1984 USFL playoff loss to the Philadelphia Stars where he further injured the knee, ending his career. In seven NFL seasons (1976–1982), Barbaro intercepted 39 passes, currently the fourth highest total in Chiefs history while his 771 career interception yards is second all-time, behind Hall of Famer Emmitt Thomas. He participated in every eligible game, 101 consecutive games in total, during his career. Retirement and personal life Barbaro currently resides in Metarie, Louisiana where he works in the food service industry and is a uniform inspector in every New Orleans Saints home football game. On September 29, 2013, Barbaro became the 43rd member named to the Chiefs Hall of Fame by Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt.

The export DeSoto based on the Plymouth was first introduced in 1937 and was built in Detroit. Chrysler Corporation of Canada, which before 1947 enjoyed \\"Imperial Preference\\" reduced tarriff barriers in British empire markets, did not start building export DeSotos until late in the 1939 model year. In 1946, the export DeSoto became the DeSoto Diplomat. They were exported to Europe, South Africa, South America, Hawaii, New Zealand, and Australia. In 1955, Chrysler of Canada did not export any cars and all 1955 Diplomats came from Detroit. In the late 1950s, some European taxicab drivers preferred to have a Perkins P4C diesel engine in the Diplomat; these diesel engines were installed on a Belgian assembly line. From 1938 to 1956, the export DeSoto used Plymouth bodies with a grille that looked similar to the regular DeSoto but fit the Plymouth grille opening. From 1957 to 1959, the DeSoto Diplomat used the DeSoto Firesweep front clip with Plymouth body. The 1960 and 1961 DeSoto Diplomats were based on the full-size Dodge Dart. Although 1960 was the last year for DeSoto in Canada and 1961 for the United States and export markets, Chrysler South Africa built a number of 1962 DeSoto Diplomats based on the Dodge Dart 440 sedan. 16 years after DeSoto ended production, Chrysler would revive the Diplomat name for an M-body Dodge.

Origins Forrest (\\"F. O.\\") Calvin from Pleasanton, Kansas studied journalism and advertising at the University of Kansas in the late 1920s. In 1928, F. O. drew a briefly-used version of the KU mascot, the Jayhawk. After graduating from college, F. O. went to work for an advertising agency in Kansas City, doing direct mail advertising and commercial art and finding both rough-going. However, his tenure at that agency did lead to an interesting discovery. The ad agency was occasionally using a 16 mm movie camera to make little advertising films for its clients. This was an almost unheard-of practice, as the 16 mm film format was at the time reserved mostly for home movies, though it was convenient and inexpensive and perfect for educational and business films. F. O. Calvin was determined to invest in the future of 16 mm. The agency did not survive the Great Depression, but in 1931 F. O. and his wife Betty founded the Calvin Company, originally an advertising agency that specialized in 16 mm business movies. They started out in a one-room office in the Business Men Assurance Building, across the street from Union Station in Kansas City. Betty Calvin managed the business side; F. O. Calvin was the salesman. In the early years, most of their time was divided between convincing prospective industrial clients that 16 mm was right for them, and then producing the movies. Early on, the Calvins took advantage of Kansas City's proximity to locations, industry, and commerce, and their earliest clients were area-based businesses and organizations such as Kansas Flour Mills, the Security Benefit Association of Topeka, Kansas, the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, Western Auto, and Kansas City Southern Railways. In 1932, one of F. O.'s former college fraternity brothers, Lloyd Thompson (a photography enthusiast who was interested in film technology), joined the fledgling Calvin Company as vice-president. The next year, another of F. O. Calvin's old college buddies, Larry Sherwood, joined the company as executive producer and general sales manager. After a few years, the Calvin Company had done some decent business and amassed a regular staff of twenty persons. In 1936, they moved into their own studio and headquarters building in Kansas City. This facility also included a state-of-the-art 16 mm film processing laboratory that Calvin used for its own productions, as well as for providing processing services to smaller 16 mm producers with their own filmmaking capacity, such as universities. These services helped to spread and further the Calvin name throughout the non-theatrical film industry. After a while, nationally known Fortune 500 companies began to take a chance on 16 mm and hired the Calvin Company to produce sales training and promotional movies for them. DuPont, Goodyear, Caterpillar Tractor Company, General Mills, Southwestern Bell, and Westinghouse had all joined Calvin's client list by the end of the 1930s. These were accounts that would last for decades. Calvin also branched out into the educational film field, producing pioneering classroom films that were distributed through companies such as McGraw-Hill, Encyclopædia Britannica, and the U.S. Office of Education to public schools throughout the country. The Calvin Company also became known as an innovative and creative force in the non-theatrical movie industry. They pioneered many efficient 16 mm filmmaking and processing methods, and in 1938 they claimed to have produced the first business film in full sound and full color. The 1940s In 1940, F. O. Calvin formed a subsidiary, the Movie-Mite Corporation, that manufactured 16 mm motion picture projectors and other equipment. These included the first desk-sized movie projector. Tens of thousands of these \\"Movie-Mites\\" were sold through the 1940s. World War II proved a gold mine for the Calvin Company, which prospered by making dozens of safety and training films for the Navy and Air Force, as well as numerous morale-boosting shorts sponsored by the likes of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Toward the end of the war, F. O. Calvin was a dollar-a-year-man for the Navy in Washington, D.C., advising on the running of a filmmaking system similar to the Calvin Company's. The Navy had wanted him to move the Calvin operations to Washington, but F. O. had resisted, wishing the setup to remain in Kansas City, a town he liked to work and live in. The work for the armed forces during the war established a good name and reputation for the Calvin Company, and the firm continued to produce films for the U.S. government for years afterward. By the end of the war, the Calvin Company had experienced terrific growth. The company's regular staff had grown to sixty persons, and they had moved into their newest and biggest headquarters, a seven-story fireproof brick building at the corner of Truman Road and Troost Avenue, just east of downtown Kansas City. The New Center Building, as it was called, had been built in 1907 and had originally housed two large movie theaters on its first floor, and the Calvin Company converted them into two huge sound stages for film production, said to be the largest between New York and Los Angeles. The Calvin building also contained projection rooms, conference rooms, executive offices, offices for directors and writers, animation studios, printing and processing labs, and space for the Movie-Mite Corporation, which kept going strong until the early 1950s. Following World War II, there was a tremendous boom in production of industrial and educational films in the U.S., and the Calvin Company was in line to be the leading producer in the field. There was also now a plethora of affordable new 16 mm film equipment on the market, and while this signaled that the Calvin Company's initial goal of popularizing 16 mm had been achieved, it also brought many inexperienced new producers into the field. In 1947, sensing this as an industry problem, F. O. Calvin decided to have his company organize a three-day seminar called the Calvin Workshop, held on the company's sound stages in Kansas City where workable 16 mm filmmaking procedures would be explained and demonstrated. Anybody in the non- theatrical film industry in North America was invited to attend, and the event attracted over two hundred people. It was so successful that the Calvin Company decided to continue it, making it a celebrated annual event that was held every year until 1975. At its peak, the Calvin Workshop attracted some 450 producers and technicians from the U.S. and Canada each year. The 1950s and \\"Golden Age\\" The Calvin Company's \\"Golden Age\\" lasted roughly a decade, from the late 1940s until the late 1950s. At the time, the business of making films for businesses and schools was booming, and Calvin was the country's leading producer in that field, regularly making movies for all of the biggest Fortune 500 companies, and often winning festival awards and prizes for these efforts as well. After World War II, the Calvin staff grew from one hundred to two hundred, and then eventually to nearly three hundred full-time workers. The company did not hire freelancers, and kept a permanent staff. There were always about four or five directors on staff, and the same rotating number of writers, cameramen, editors, and sound technicians. This made it possible for at least four movies to be in production at once. All film production was supervised by Frank Barhydt, a former Kansas City radio and newspaper writer who went to work for the firm as a director during the war due to his interest in documentary films. There were annual Christmas parties and Fourth of July picnics, as well as a long-lived tradition on payday of employees visiting a nearby pub and betting their paychecks on shuffleboard bowling. At Calvin a union was voted out several times. There was profit-sharing, access to top management, and encouragement of initiative. During this time, they were turning out some 18 million feet of film a year (\\"or enough to make one 16-millimeter strip stretching from Key West to Seattle and part way back,\\" as one contemporary local newspaper put it). In 1951 they were the first outside firm to be licensed by Eastman Kodak to process its color film, and in the early 1950s Calvin was the first professional movie company to utilize the 8 mm film format. In the late 1950s, the Calvin Company made significant inroads in the educational film field, forming a subsidiary called University Films that often produced educational shorts in conjunction with universities and with publishing companies such as McGraw-Hill. By the 1950s, Calvin was a brand name of merit trusted by Fortune 500 companies and film industry people throughout the country. Despite this, the firm was not particularly well known in Kansas City. However, it did serve as an important venue for the Kansas City arts, consistently employing many local actors and actresses, many of whom earned their main income in other fields such as radio and television announcing. They included Art Ellison, Shelby Storck, James Lantz, Bill Yearout, Murray Nolte, Twila Pollard, Henry Effertz, Bob Kerr, Keith Painton, Ken Heady, Leonard Belove, Stan Levitt, Harriet Levitt, Ralph Seeley, Harvey Levine, James Assad, Al Christy, and Sid Cutright. A few of these went on to careers as character actors and actresses in movies and TV, but most stayed in Kansas City and the only TV or movie roles they ever landed were ones in films and programs filmed on location in the area, such as In Cold Blood, Paper Moon, The Day After, and Mr. and Mrs. Bridge. The Calvin Company also occasionally brought professional actors and actresses from Hollywood to do special roles or narration in their films. William Frawley, John Carradine, Jane Darwell, Morey Amsterdam, Arte Johnson, Judy Carne, James Whitmore, and E.G. Marshall all starred in Calvin offerings. Calvin could also sometimes call on former local people such as Harry Truman, Walter Cronkite, Thomas Hart Benton, and John Cameron Swayze to turn in appearances. Calvin provided opportunities to aspiring young filmmakers from the area who would not or could not go to Hollywood. Calvin served as training for feature film and television directors as Robert Altman, Richard C. Sarafian, and Reza Badiyi. Altman, a Kansas City native, got his start directing films with Calvin in the early 1950s and used many Calvin regulars as cast and crew on his independently produced first feature film, The Delinquents, shot in Kansas City in 1956 and starring Tom Laughlin. This moderately successful teenage exploitation film, produced by area-based movie theater exhibitor Elmer Rhoden Jr., led to Altman's successful career in movies and television, and also led to a second feature film produced by Rhoden Jr. and concerned with troubled youth, The Cool and the Crazy, shot in Kansas City in 1958. This movie also featured many Calvin stalwarts in the cast and crew. The 1960s and Closure In 1959, the original four founders of the Calvin Company retired and, though they continued to serve on the firm's advisory board, the Calvin organization came under new management. Leonard Keck, a longtime Calvin executive, took over presidential duties and the company's name was changed to Calvin Productions. This change in management led to the departure of several longtime core production employees and a slow but steady decline in business during the 1960s. By 1968, the production staff had been cut drastically and several longtime accounts had drifted away. Keck attempted to combat the slow period and expand by renaming the company Calvin Communications and purchasing the first two floors of the building that the company had started out in with a one-room office back in 1931, but the whole situation worsened when projectors were traded in for VCRs. During the 1970s, Calvin briefly attempted to catch a part of the videotape market, but the company was more suited to the 16 mm film format which it had originally pioneered forty years earlier, and the idea of shifting to video was soon abandoned. Satellite studios in Louisville, Pittsburgh and Detroit were sold. Finally, there was just the Calvin studios in Kansas City, where it had all begun, and around 1980 regular film production ceased. Only the Calvin film processing laboratory continued, losing more and more business and more and more money until finally it officially ceased operation on Halloween of 1982. In 1991, the old seven-story Calvin headquarters at 1105 Truman Road fell to the wrecking ball to make way for a large virtual school project. Legacy In 2002, industrial film archivist Rick Prelinger moved 150 of the Calvin Company's surviving film prints and approximately 25,000 cans of film master materials and unclaimed items from Calvin's laboratory from Kansas City to the Library of Congress, where about 3,000 Calvin films are, as of autumn 2019, being accessioned and catalogued. Several of the Calvin Company's films, including the cult classic The Your Name Here Story (a satire of commonly used industrial film formats and cliches produced for showing at one of the Calvin Workshop seminars), are available for free viewing and downloading from the Prelinger Archives. Also available for free viewing and downloading at Prelinger are eleven reels of outtakes and stock footage found in the Calvin Company's vaults, some of which derives from the production of The Your Name Here Story. However, the reels contain footage from many different Calvin productions dating from around 1940 to the early 1960s. The Calvin film Delegating Work (1959) can be purchased along with other Calvin films on office management problems such as The Bright Young Newcomer on the compilation videotape As the Office Turns through A/V Geeks. The award-winning safety film The Perfect Crime (1954) (directed by Robert Altman), as well as other films like The Color of Danger (1968) and Your School Safety Patrol (1958), can be purchased on videotape or DVD through Something Weird Video.

After a two-year rotating internship at the University of Maryland Hospital, he trained in internal medicine and gastroenterology at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, all in preparation to enter practice in Carroll County, Maryland. Woodward entered the service of the United States Army in January 1941, just prior to the outbreak of World War II. During the ensuing five years, he served in various medical units and with the United States Typhus Fever Commission with assignments in North Africa, Italy, England, France, New Guinea and offshore islands, and the Philippine Islands.

Early life and education Barber attended White Oak High School, where he played Quarterback, passing for over 4,000 yards, and graduated in 1972. He then attended Louisiana Tech where he was converted to Tight end. He was selected in the second round of 1976 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers. He played for the Oilers for six years, and then finished his career playing four years for the Los Angeles Rams. He then retired to work in ministry. Career High school coaching During the mid-1990s, Mike returned to football,, when he took a voluntary coaching position at Trinity Christian School in Cedar Hill, Texas. He coached for two years with Trinity, and then left amid a minor dispute to join Arlington's Grace Prep Academy, where he coached or was involved with coaching between 1998 and 2005. Grace Prep was successful while Barber was the coach (in various guises, including head coach); during his eight-year tenure there, the team had a winning record every season, and won the State Championship in their division five of those years. However, he was suspended for a year in 2001, and was fired from the Head coaching position in May 2006 after a dispute with school administrators. He has since focused his efforts on his ministry. Controversy While associated with the Grace Prep football program, Barber was given \\"one of the sternest sanctions ever administered\\" by the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools. According to TAPPS, he had offered athletes \\"improper inducements\\". He was suspended from coaching for a year, and the school's program placed on three years' probation. Barber denied all accusations and maintains that he did nothing improper. Because several prominent players transferred to Grace Prep along with Barber (for some of whom he was accused of improperly paying tuition, a claim he denies), TAPPS instituted what is informally known as \\"The Mike Barber Rule\\": players who follow a coach to another school are ineligible from playing for a year. In July 2006, the Dallas Morning News published an article titled \\"Barber Prison Ministry Spreads The Word -- And The Wealth\\", discussing in detail Barber and his various relatives' notably high incomes from his non-profit organization.

The Whartons, Inc. was an early silent film production company in Ithaca, New York from 1914 to 1919. The Ithaca Studio was established by brothers Theodore and Leopold Wharton on the shores of Cayuga Lake, at the site of what is now Stewart Park. Currently, efforts are underway to create a silent movie museum in the former Wharton movie studio building in Stewart Park.  Ithaca (1912 - 1920)  After filming a Cornell-Penn football game on the way to visit family in Ludlowville, New York, Theodore Wharton returned to Ithaca in 1913 with a cast and crew that included Francis X. Bushman and Beverly Bayne. A year later, his older brother Leopold joined him, and the two set up the Whartons Studio and began making films. The Wharton brothers were responsible for bringing many famous movie stars to Ithaca on the overnight train from New York City, making Ithaca the unofficial capital of the silent film industry. The movies were shot within elaborate studio sets and in natural sites around Ithaca including the gorges on the Cornell University campus and in the woods near Beebe Lake.  Santa Cruz (1926 - 1931)  In the early 1920s, the Wharton studio moved from Ithaca to Santa Cruz, California in response to promotion by Santa Cruz mayor Fred Swanton. By then the majority of the film industry had settled in Southern California and Hollywood because of the ability to shoot year-round. The studio was incorporated as Wharton Film Classics, Inc. Leopold died in 1927 and Theodore in 1931, without ever making a movie in the city. Much of the evidence of the brothers' prolific cinematic career was lost in 1929, when hundreds of nitrate-based film reels belonging to the Wharton Brothers spontaneously combusted in the storage shed at the home of their lawyer.

The name means Net (jāla - net, netting, entanglement) of Brahmā. The sutta is also called 'Atthajala' (Net of Essence), Dhammajala, (Net of the Dhamma), Ditthijala (Net of Views), Anuttarasangama Vijaya (Incomparable Victory in Battle). The sutta discusses two main topics: the elaboration of the Ten Precepts (Cula-sila), the Middle Precepts (Majjhima-sila), and the Great Precepts (Maha-sila). Cula-sila deals with the Ten Precepts to be practiced by devout Buddhists, while Majjhima-sila gives a detailed description of the practice of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth precepts, together with a further delineation of virtuous practices and abstentions. The second and third parts of the sutta discuss the 62 beliefs (ditthi) which are clung to by ascetics in India. These are divided into: 18 beliefs related to the past (pubbantanuditthino), and 44 beliefs about the future (aparantakappika). Many of these beliefs are still relevant in the modern world and thus the sutta provides Buddhist scholars with much information to ponder about the Buddha's teachings. The elaboration of these beliefs is very detailed, focusing on how the beliefs (faiths) come to be and the way they are described and declared. The elaboration ends with the Buddha's statement about the danger of clinging to these beliefs, as they are still influenced by desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and ignorance (avijjā) that its faithful followers will not end in the final liberation but still in the cycle of samsara. Believers of these faiths are compared to small fish in a pond which will be captured by a fine net no matter how much they want to escape, while those who see reality as it is are beyond the net of samsara. Beginning The sutta starts with the Buddha travelling with his disciples between the cities of Rajagaha and Nalanda. At the same time, a Brahmin called Suppiya, with his young apprentice, Brahmadatta, were also travelling in the same direction, tailing the convoy of the sangha. Suppiya uttered some insulting words about the Buddha, his teachings, and his disciples. However, Brahmadatta praised and revered the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The two continued debating until they arrived at the King's resting place in Ambalatthika. Hearing this conversation, some monks discussed the nature of conflicting students and teachers the next morning. They wondered how marvellous it was that the Buddha knew the various kinds of views to be found in people. The Buddha arrived and asked what they were discussing. As a monk finished telling him, the Buddha responded, Precepts In the first part, the Buddha elaborates precepts that made people praise him or the Sangha as worthy of reverence. The list of the Buddha's higher precepts are categorized as follows: Cula Sila * 1. Abstain from taking another creature's life, weapons, violence. * 2. Abstain from taking things which were not given. * 3. Live soberly, piously, and honestly. * 4. Abstain from unjust sexual relationships. * 5. Abstain from lying. * 6. Speak only the truth, believable and reliable, and never contradict his own words. * 7. Abstain from slander. * 8. Promote, speak, and love union (harmony) and not division (conflict). * 9. Abstain from rough, insulting words. * 10. Speak polite, likeable, exact, well chosen words that will make people's hearts joyful, not wasting time in idle gossip. * 11. Discuss the Dhamma and the Vinaya at the right time. * 12. Discuss in clear, detailed, and understandable words. Majjhima Sila * 13. Abstain from hurting seeds, plants, roots, branches, cheating, trading, slavery, forgery, bribery, and criminal conduct. * 14. Abstain from hoarding food, drink, clothes (robes), bedding, perfume, spices, and other tools. * 15. Take food once a day. * 16. Abstain from watching shows (dances, exhibitions, matches, music performances, parades, etc.). * 17. Abstain from playing games (card games, board games, dice games, games of chance, racing games, acrobatics, word games, etc.). * 18. Abstain from using luxurious furniture and bedding. * 19. Abstain from using cosmetics, make-up, and fancy or luxurious clothes (robes). * 20. Abstain from discussing people, politicians, criminals, terrors, food and beverages, clothing, places, families, cities, wars and battles, heroes, ghosts, street rumors, speculation on how the world is created, or about existence and non-existence. * 21. Abstain from accusing, denying, goading or challenging (e.g., 'I practised the Dhamma devoutly, but you don't!' or 'What you say is old rubbish!' or 'You are wrong!' or 'Free yourself if you can!'). * 22. Abstain from being the courier or messenger of politicians or higher administrations. * 23. Abstain from deceiving lay people by uttering spells to exorcise demons or make someone's fortune, acting like a holy person by reciting mantras. Maha Sila * 24. Abstain from earning money from fortune-telling, divination, clairvoyance, exorcism, conjuring, magic tricks, spells, making false medicine and herbs, healing people through magic, leading/conducting ceremonies in order to gain something (wealth, fertility, etc.). Eighteen beliefs about the past In the second part, the Buddha explains the major beliefs of ascetics in India. He begins by saying, \\"Monks, there are other things which are very deep (profound), very hard to understand, very difficult to perceive, so holy and sacred, unreached by means of mind, so subtle, that they are only to be understood and experienced by the wise. These things were perceived clearly, seen clearly and were discarded by the Tathagata, and by this act based on the truth that people praise and revered Tathagatha. What are those things?\\" Eternalistic belief Eternalism is described in the sutta as the belief which is based upon the past, and holds that the universe (loka) and the soul or self (attha) are eternal as a 'rock mountain or strong-fastened pole'. The world doesn't create new souls and therefore, the souls are living in an eternal cycle of death and rebirth, differing only in name, location, and time. These kind of beliefs have four origins: * 1. Ascetics and Brahmins who have reached a high level of meditation; due to this achievement, they were able to remember from one to tens of thousands of their past lives. * 2. Ascetics and Brahmins who have reached the spiritual achievements which provided them access to memories of one to ten iterations of the Earth's formation, evolution, and destruction. * 3. Ascetics and Brahmins who have managed to recall the Earth's evolutionary process from ten to forty times. The abovementioned ascetics and Brahmins recalled how they had name, family, heirs, food, joy and sadness, then death and rebirth in their past lives. Based on their experience, they concluded that the universe and the soul must be eternal. * 4. Ascetics and Brahmins who use logic and inference and come to the conclusion that the soul and universe are eternal. The Buddha said that there are 18 types of eternalistic belief, all based on one of these four origins. All of the followers of these beliefs defended and clung to their faith and did not give credence to other faiths. Partial-eternalistic belief The semi-eternalistic belief is described as belief that is based on the past, where the dualistic notion is asserted that there are things which are eternal and things which are not eternal. There are four ways these beliefs come to be faith, where one believer never acknowledged the other beliefs: The Buddha told a story about a time when the Earth was not yet formed. The sentient beings in this time normally lived in the realm of Abhassara, in radiant light and nourished by celestial joy. Then came a time when the Earth was in the process of forming yet still uninhabitable. One of these beings in the Abhassara realm died (due to the exhaustion of his karma) and was reborn in the higher realm called the Brahma realm and lived alone in the palace there. From living alone for so long a time, this being grew distressed and longed for a companion. He then uttered, \\"O, let it be that another being may come here and accompany me.\\" At the same time as the utterance, a being in the Abhassara realm died (due to the exhaustion of his good karma) and was reborn in the Brahma realm as his follower, but in many ways, similar to his feature. Seeing this happen, the Brahma being thought, \\"I am Brahma, Mahābrahmā, the Almighty, Omniscient, the Lord of All, Creator, Master of all creatures. I am the source of all life, Father to everything which exists and will come to exist. These creatures are my creations. How can I conclude this? Because, just as I was thinking, \\"Let it be that another being may come here and accompany me\\", then my wish made that being come into existence.\\" Beings that came after thought the same thing. They worshipped and revered the Brahma because, \\"He was here even before I existed! Surely he is the Lord and Creator of All.\\" In the Brahma realm, the first being had longer and more powerful features than the latter coming beings. So, a probability existed that the latter being died in the Brahma realm, and then was reborn as a human. This human abandoned worldly affairs and became an ascetic, then by his devotion and practice, achieved the power to remember his one past life. As he recalled it, he came to the conclusion that creatures, including himself, are not eternal, had limited age, were vulnerable to change, but that Brahma is eternal, ageless, and changeless. The second semi-eternalistic belief came from ascetics who were once Khiddapadosika gods, celestial beings that were too busy to experience desire-based joy and fun, forgot to take their nutriments and therefore, died. As they were reborn as ascetics and achieved the ability to remember their past life, they came to a conclusion analogous to the 'Fall from Grace': \\"If only we were not so greedy and overzealous in our previous life, if only we had been able to control ourselves, we would not have suffered death. Now that we had made this error, we have to suffer this mortal life\\". Here, they concluded that the gods were eternal, and others were not. The third semi- eternalistic belief came from the Manopadosika gods. These were the gods who always envied the other gods. This illness of mind caused their death. In the same cycle, they were reborn as ascetic Manopadosika gods, achieved the ability to remember their past life, and came to the conclusion, \\"Had we not been envious, we would have stayed strong and intelligent. We would never have died or fallen forever from the realm of gods.\\". The fourth semi-eternalistic belief is based on logic and reflection. The people who embraced this belief concluded their faith based on their thoughts and logics as follow: \\"Here is what is called (atta) of eyes, nose, tongue, and our physical body, which are always changed. But, there is also atta of mind: the state of mind, awareness of 'atta', which is eternal.\\". All of the followers of these beliefs defended and clung to their faith and didn't believe in other faiths. The Universe (Doctrines of the Finitude and Infinity of the World)  The beliefs on the universe is based on the speculation about the infinite or the limited nature of the universe. There are four ways these beliefs were expressed: * 1. The universe is infinite. * 2. The universe is limited. * 3. The universe is vertically limited but horizontally infinite. * 4. The universe is neither limited nor infinite. The source of these beliefs came from two reasons: * 1. The frame of mind which formed these beliefs came from the object of focus of meditation taken by the ascetics who managed to reach a deep level of meditation and came to the conclusion that the world is infinite (if they used infinity as the object of meditation), or limited (if they imagined the object of their focus to be limited). * 2. The people who used logic and thought and concluded that the world must be neither infinite nor limited. All of the followers of these beliefs defended and clung to their faith and didn't believe in other faiths. Ambiguous Evasion The concept of ambiguous evasion or eel-wriggling (Pali: Amaravikkhepa) is introduced in the Brahmajala sutta. When hearing Buddhist teachings, the Buddha claims that people would react with four forms of ambiguous evasion: # Evasion out of fear or hatred of making false claims. # Evasion out of fear or hatred of attachment. # Evasion out of fear or hatred of debate. # Evasion out of fear or hatred of admitting ignorance. In other words, when a person would hear the dharma, they would respond, \\"I don't know. Maybe it is true. Maybe it is not true. I can't say it's true because I don't know and I can't deny it's true because I don't know.\\" The idea is that the person isn't considering the arguments presented (see Kalama Sutta), but stubbornly adhering to irrational agnosticism out of feelings of fear or hatred. Non-causality beliefs The Non-causality beliefs stated that the Universe and the Souls happened coincidentally. The proponents of these beliefs claimed that there was/were no reason/s behind the creation of Universe and the Identity/Self. These beliefs were expressed because of two possibilities: * 1 There were gods called assannasatta, which had only body and no mental will. The absence of mental will in this state was due to the nature of repressed thoughts, not the ultimate absence of thoughts. As they died in the god realm, there was a possibility that they were reborn as ascetics who achieved the ability to recall just one past life. Here, they concluded upon their past life that, \\"Before this, there were no Atta and Loka. So, the Atta and Loka were created without a cause. They simply arise spontaneously. Why do I deem so? Because I didn't exist and now I do exist.\\" * 2. The ascetics who based their thoughts on logic and thinkings, and concluded that the Soul and the Universe happened without a cause. All of the followers of these beliefs defended and clung on their faith and didn't believe in another faiths. Forty-four beliefs about the future There are ascetics who based their beliefs on the future. The proponents of one of these beliefs, adhered that: Perception's existence after death * A. the perception still exists after death. The difference of beliefs were described that after death, the Atta: ** 1. possessed physical shape (rupa) ** 2. possessed no shape/immaterial (arupa) ** 3. both had physical shape some had not (rupa and arupa) ** 4. neither possessed physical shape nor immaterial ** 5. Infinite ** 6. Limited ** 7. Both Infinite and limited ** 8. neither Infinite nor Limited ** 9. had a certain form of consciousness ** 10. had several form of consciousness ** 11.had infinite consciousness ** 12.had limited consciousness ** 13.always in joy/blissful state ** 14.always in suffering state ** 15.Both in joy and suffering ** 16.neither joyful nor suffering * B. the Perception vanished after death. The difference of beliefs were described that after death, the Atta was devoid of perception after dead but: ** 1. possessed physical shape (rupa) ** 2. possessed no physical shape (arupa) ** 3. Both had shape and no shape ** 4. Neither had shape nor had no shape ** 5. Limited ** 6. Unlimited ** 7. Both limited and unlimited ** 8. Neither limited nor infinite * C. Neither there was Perception of No Perception after death. The difference of these beliefs were describe that after death, the Atta was neither devoid of perception nor non-perception, but: ** 1. possessed physical shape (rupa) ** 2. possessed no physical shape (arupa) ** 3. Both had shape and no shape ** 4. Neither had shape nor had no shape ** 5. Limited ** 6. Unlimited ** 7. Both limited and unlimited ** 8. Neither limited nor infinite All of the followers of these beliefs defended and clung on their faith and didn't believe in another faiths. Annihilation (nihilism) beliefs The proponent of these beliefs declared that after death, existence simply vanished (Atta vanished). These beliefs were described in seven type of authorities and basis: * 1. that the Atta was created from the union of father and mother's essence, composed of four elements (dhatu) and on the death, these elements ceased to exist. By this manner, Atta become non-existent. * 2. that not only the (1) but the physical-related desire of the celestial gods, who had physical shape and take nourishment, which also cease to exist after death. * 3. that not only the (2), but the atta of Brahma gods, which were shaped of Jhana mind, and faculties of senses which cease to exist after death. * 4. that not only the (3), but also the atta which had transcended the concept of Infinity, where the perception of shape had been surpassed, the perception of contact between mind and object had vanished, not paying attention to major kinds of Perception, which cease to exist after death. * 5. that not only the (4), but also the atta which had reached the Realm of Infinity of Consciousness. * 6. that not only the (5), but also the atta which had reached Realm of Nothingness. * 7. that not only the (6) but also the atta which had reached the realm of neither Perception nor Non-Perception. All of the followers of these beliefs defended and clung on their faith and didn't believe in another faiths. Five beliefs on attainable Nibbana The proponents of these faiths proposed that Nibbana's state of bliss could be attained in the current life. They based their faith because: * 1. The joy coming from the five senses can be enjoyed and attained thoroughly. So, the Nibbana could also be attained. * 2. The joy from the five senses were vulnerable to change and mortal. But the joy from the attainment of the first Jhana (Dhyana) can be enjoyed and attained thoroughly. So, with the first Jhana, the Nibbana could also be attained. * 3. ..... (same with No.2) but with Second Jhana... * 4. ..... (same with No.3) but with Third Jhana... * 5. ..... (same with No.4) but with Fourth Jhana. So, the Nibbana could also be attained. All of the followers of these beliefs defended and clung on their faith and didn't believe in another faiths. The Buddha's conclusion \\"The Tathagata knows these sixty-two views. He also knows the dhamma which surpasses them. Knowing that dhamma, he does not view it in the wrong way. Since he does not view it in the wrong way, he realizes by himself the extinction of defilements (i.e., greed, anger, and ignorance of the Four Ariya Truths). Buddha finally concludes the exposition of these 'wrong' beliefs by stating that these (62) beliefs, if they are believed, will certainly cause agitations and cravings. It implies that the beliefs come to conclusion due to the inability to see the truth, as they are seized by craving (clinging), agitated by longing (feeling). The Buddha further explains that the beliefs are originated from Contact (Phassa) as the cause. The contact is a phenomenon when the perception recognised an object beyond our Self. Then, from this brief event (like lightning in the sky, in the comparison drawn by Nagasena in Milinda Panha), rise up feelings. Buddha states that there are no possibilities of feeling without contact. Thus, according to the law of Twelve Related Chain of Cause and Effects (Pratitya-samutpada), the people who believe in one of many of these sixty-two beliefs, will end up in round cycle of sufferings; as they have not found the truth on the cease of sufferings. Due to their faith, they will experience feelings as a result of repeated contact through the six sense bases. In them feeling gives rise to craving; craving gives rise to clinging; clinging gives rise to current existence (upapatti bhava) and the kammic causal process (kamma bhava); the kammic causal process gives rise to rebirth; and rebirth gives rise to ageing, death, grief, lamentation, pain, distress and despair. The Buddha states that Monks who have realized and understood the origin of contact of the six senses, and escaped the round of sufferings, would see Dhamma (Truth) of Precepts (Śīla), Concentration (Samadhi) and Wisdom (Pańńa) which surpassed all the wrong beliefs. The Buddha then makes an analogy of a fisherman using a fine-meshed net to catch the fish in the pond. The fish represent the ascetics who cling to their beliefs. They will rise and sink in the pond, but in the end will unavoidably be caught in the net. Whereas the Buddha, who stand outside the net has found the truth and has transcended the cycle of suffering.

It is a part of the Dhaka Division. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, rests on the eastern banks of the Buriganga River which flows from the Turag to the south of the district. While Dhaka (city corporation) occupies only about a fifth of the area of Dhaka district, it is the economic, political and cultural centre of the district and the country as a whole. Dhaka district consist with Dhaka city, Keraniganj , Nababganj, Dohar, Savar and Dhamrai upazila. Dhaka District is an administrative entity, and like many other cities, it does not cover the modern conurbation which is Greater Dhaka, which has spilled into neighbouring districts, nor does the conurbation cover the whole district, as there are rural areas within the district.  History  Lalbagh Fort was developed by Shaista Khan. The administrative Dhaka District was first established in 1772. But, the existence of urbanised settlements in the area that is now Dhaka city – dates from the 7th century. The present day Savar was the capital of the Sanbagh Kingdom during seventh and eighth century. The city area of Dhaka was ruled by the Buddhist kingdom of Kamarupa and the Pala Empire before passing to the control of the Hindu Sena dynasty in the 9th century. Many believe that the name of the city was derived after the establishment of the Goddess Dhakeshwari's temple by Ballal Sena in the 12th century. Dhaka and its surrounding area was identified as Bengalla around that period. The town itself consisted of a few market centres like Lakshmi Bazar, Shankhari Bazar, Tanti Bazar, Patuatuli, Kumartuli, Bania Nagar and Goal Nagar. After the Sena dynasty, Dhaka was successively ruled by the Turkish and Afghan governors descending from the Delhi Sultanate before the arrival of the Mughals in 1608. The development of townships and a significant growth in population came as the city was proclaimed the capital of Bengal under Mughal rule in 1608. During Mughal rule the areas currently under Dhaka district was famous for its textile products – especially the Muslin. Mughal subahdar Islam Khan was the first administrator of the city. Khan named the town \\"Jahangir Nagar\\" (City of Jahangir) in honour of the Mughal emperor Jahangir, although this name was dropped soon after Jahangir's death. The main expansion of the city took place under Mughal general Shaista Khan. The city then measured 19 by 13 kilometres (12 by 8 mi), with a population of nearly a million people. The city passed to the control of the British East India Company in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey and eventually to the Crown, British Empire, in 1765 at the Battle of Buxar. The city's population shrank dramatically during this period as the prominence of Kolkata rose, but substantive development and modernisation eventually followed. A modern civic water supply system was introduced in 1874 and electricity supply launched in 1878. The Dhaka Cantonment was established near the city, serving as a base for British and Indian soldiers. Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban houses the national parliament. During the abortive Partition of Bengal in 1905, Dhaka was declared to be the capital of the newly established state of Eastern Bengal and Assam, but Bengal was reunited in 1911. The rural areas under present Dhaka district, especially Dohar Upazila were used for the production of indigo. Following the partition of Bengal in (1947) appending the partition of British India in 1947, Dhaka became the capital of East Bengal as a part of the new Muslim state of Pakistan, while western part of Bengal with a majority Hindu population had become a part of the new and independent India, designated as West Bengal with Calcutta as state capital. Calcutta witnessed communal violence that left thousands of people dead. A large proportion of the city's Hindu population departed for India, while the city received hundreds of thousands of Muslim immigrants from Calcutta, India. The city's population rose dramatically in a very short period of time, which created severe shortages and infrastructural problems. As the centre of regional politics, Dhaka saw an increasing number of political strikes and incidents of violence. The adoption of Urdu as the sole official language of Pakistan led to protest marches involving large crowds. Known as the language movement of 1952, the protests resulted in police firing which killed students who were demonstrating peacefully. Throughout the 1950s and '60s, Dhaka remained a hotbed of political activity, and the demands for autonomy for the Bengali population gradually gained momentum. The 1970 Bhola cyclone devastated much of the region, killing an estimated 500,000 people. More than half the city of Dhaka was flooded and millions of people marooned. With public anger growing against ethnic discrimination and poor cyclone relief efforts from the central government, Bengali politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman held a nationalist rally on 7 March 1971 at the Race Course Ground. An estimated one million people attended the gathering, leading to Ziaur Rahman's 26 March declaration of Bangladesh's independence. In response, the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight, which led to the arrests, torture and killing of hundreds of thousands of people, mainly Hindus and Bengali intellectuals.Blood, Archer, , Department of State, United States During the Bangladesh Liberation War the Pakistan army arrested and killed fourteen Muktijoddhas from Dhamrai Bazar. A mass grave created during the war still exists in the western side of Kalampur Bazar. The Pak army also burnt down many houses in Konakhola, Basta, Brahmankirtha, Goalkhali and Khagail Kholamora villages of Keraniganj Upazila. The fall of Dhaka city to the allied forces led by Jagjit Singh Aurora on 16 December marked the surrender of Pakistan army. The post-independence period has seen a rapid and massive growth of the city population, attracting migrant workers from rural areas across Bangladesh. A real estate boom has followed the expansion of city limits and the development of new settlements such as Gulshan, Banani and Motijheel.  Demographics  The population of the division reached 18,305,671 people as of Census 2012 revised figures. Some 9,852,835 males live in the city as of the 2012 census, for a sex ratio of 119. Since the district is different from Greater Dhaka, some 3.6 million people are classified as rural. The district population grew at 4.73% annually over the decade, and is home to 2,786,183 households.  Administration  * Administrator of Zila Porishod: Hasina Doula * Deputy Commissioner (DC): MOHAMMAD SALAH UDDINhttp://pmis.mopa.gov.bd/pmis/Forms/dclist.php  Subdivisions  The district does not cover all parts of Greater Dhaka, and Greater Dhaka does not include all parts of the district, which includes rural areas. Dhaka was established in 1772. The district consists of 46 upazilas/thanas, 86 unions, 974 mauzas, 1999 villages, 2 City Corporations, 92 City Wards, 855 City Mahallas, 3 paurashavas, 27 wards and 133 mahallas. The five upazilas in Dhaka district are: * Dhamrai Upazila, suburban and rural * Dohar Upazila, suburban and rural * Keraniganj Upazila, suburban * Nawabganj Upazila, suburban and rural * Savar Upazila, suburban * Demra Upazila, suburban and rural The municipal area of Dhaka city is under the jurisdiction of the Dhaka City Corporation; for administrative purposes, the municipal area is divided into 92 wards. Tejgaon Development Circle is merged with Dhaka City Corporation.  Geography  Dhaka District shares borders with Gazipur and Tangail to the north, Munshiganj and Rajbari to the south, Narayanganj to the east and Manikganj to the west. Main rivers flowing through this district are Padma, Kaliganga, Dhaleshwari, Ichamati, Shitalakshya, Buriganga and numerous smaller rivers including Bangshi, Turag, Balu, Elamjani, Alam, Bherujkha, Ramkrishnadi, Elisamari, Tulsikhali. Major lakes (\\"beels\\") include Belai, Saldaher, Labandaher, Churain, Damsharan and Kiranjir Beel. Annual average temperature of the district is maximum 34.5 °C, minimum 11.5 °C; average annual rainfall 1931mm.  Religion  The district of Dhaka has more than 12000 mosques, 3012 temples, 530 churches, 174 Buddhist temples, three pagodas and a synagogue. For a long time, Islam has been the majority religion in Dhaka, with only 1300 mosques, but more mosques were recently built, and the district is now called the City of Mosques.  Economy  Bashundhara City Shopping Complex Dhaka is the commercial heart of Bangladesh. The city has a large middle class population, increasing the market for modern consumer and luxury goods. Many skilled workers are employed in the businesses and industries located in the Dhaka metropolitan area. The city has historically attracted many migrant workers. Hawkers, peddlers, small shops, rickshaws transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ a large segment of the population – rickshaw-drivers alone number as many as 400,000. Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. Even so, unemployment remains high at 23%. According to CityMayors Statistics, Dhaka's GDP registered at $52 billion in 2005 with an annual growth rate of 6.1%. Its estimated GDP in the year 2020 is $126 billion. The annual per capita income of Dhaka is estimated at $550, although a large segment of the population lives below the poverty line, with many surviving on less than $3 a day. The main business districts of the city include Motijheel, Panthapath and Gulshan. Bashundhara City is a recently developed economic area that houses many high-tech industries and corporations and a shopping mall that is one of the largest in Southeast Asia, frequented daily by more than 25,000 people. The Export Processing Zone in Dhaka was set up to encourage the export of garments, textiles and other goods. The EPZ is home to 80 factories, which employ mostly women. The Dhaka Stock Exchange is based in the city, as are most of the large companies and banks of Bangladesh, including the Bangladesh Bank, HSBC, Citibank and the Grameen Bank. Urban developments have sparked a widespread construction boom, causing new high- rise buildings and skyscrapers to change the city landscape. Growth has been especially strong in the finance, banking, manufacturing, telecommunications and services sectors, while tourism, hotels and restaurants continue as important elements of the Dhaka economy.  Places of interest  The historic city of Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh and lies on the banks of the Buriganga River in the central area of Bangladesh. The old town of Dhaka, south of the city centre, is the site of most of the tourist attractions, including the Lalbagh Fort, the Stat Mosque, and the Ahsan Manzil Palace Museum. The city of Dhaka was predominantly a city of the Mughals, whose governors and viceroys built several palace, mosques and katrias. Dhaka's finest specimen of this time is the Aurangabad Fort, commonly known as Lalbagh Fort, incomplete but well worth for visit. Also in this area of Dhaka is the spectacular Ahsan Manzil Plance Museum, the Bara Katra, the Cotta Katra and several mosques of note. The old European quarter lies just north of Dhaka's old town, which houses the presidential place and the National Museum, Dhaka's commercial and diplomatic regions are north-east of this zone. Dhaka Zoo and the Botanical Gardens are a short taxi ride into the suburbs. Once famed for its Muslin, Dhaka is now renowned for pink pearls and a rich tradition of handicrafts. Shoppers can find lower prices of gold and silver products, and the Dhaka shopping areas of New market and Elephant road and Dhanmondi are good for shopping. The Botanical garden is a park at Mirpur in Dhaka.It contains various species of plants. It is also a major tourist spot.  Lalbagh Fort  Built in 1678 by the Viceroy of Bengal, it contains a three- domed mosque, the tomb of Pari Bibi, the reputed daughter of Nawab Shaista Khan, the Audience Hall and the hammam of the Governor. Four Kilometres from the hotel.  Ahsan Manzil Palace Museum  A majestic place, it was once home to the Nawab of Dhaka, and houses 23 galleries displaying portraits, furniture and household articles.  Jatiyo Smriti Soudho  Jatiyo Smriti Soudho at Savar, a tribute to the martyrs of the Bangladesh Liberation War Jatiyo Smriti Soudho or National Martyrs' Memorial is a monument in Bangladesh. It is the symbol of the valour and the sacrifice of the martyrs of the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, which brought the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistani rule. The monument is located in Savar, about 35 Kilometres north-west of the capital, Dhaka.  Star Mosque  A 200-year- old mosque with five domes, with hundreds of twinkling stars on its surface.  Satmasjid  This mosque in the Mohammadpur area of Dhaka is known for its seven domes.  National Museum  In the old European quarter of Dhaka, the museum contains many interesting collections, including sculptures and paintings of the Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim periods. One kilometre from the hotel.  Bara Katra  Bara Katra was built between 1644 and 1646 CE to be the official residence of Mughal prince Shah Shuja, the second son of emperor Shah Jahan. The prince endowed it to his diwan and the builder of the serai, Abul Qasim.

A similar physical activity, known as the jetliner position, is used as a form of torture. The exercise is characterized by the two right angles formed by the body, one at the hips and one at the knees. The person wall sitting places their back against a wall with their feet shoulder- width apart and a little ways out from the wall. Then, keeping their back against the wall, they lower their hips until their knees form right angles. This is a very intense work out for the quadriceps muscles. It can be very painful to hold this position for extended periods. Wall sits are used as a primary strengthening exercise in many sports requiring strong quadriceps like fencing, ice hockey, sailing (mostly small boat racing), skiing and track and field. This exercise is also used as a disciplinary activity in the armed forces. It takes up little space, and can be administered easily in classroom settings to misbehaving soldiers-in-training.  Method  * The participant should lean against the wall with their feet planted firmly on the ground, shoulder-width apart. Their feet should also be about two feet away from the wall (though the optimal distance will be somewhat dependent on the participant's height). * Once in such a position, the participant should slowly slide down the wall with their back pressed against it until their legs are bent at a right angle. This angle is very crucial because if the thighs are not parallel to the ground, the quadriceps will be bearing less load and the effectiveness of the exercise will be diminished. * The participant's knees should also be directly above their ankles and their back should be touching the wall at all times. * Depending on the participant's strength, they should hold the position for 20 seconds to a minute (or longer for more advanced athletes). If performing multiple repetitions of the exercise (three is often a recommended number), the participant should rest for half a minute in between to allow their muscles to recuperate. * As the participant gains strength, they can increase their holding time by small increments such as 10 seconds. While a burning feeling in the quadriceps muscles is normal, if the participant feels even a little pain in their knee or kneecap, they should be advised to immediately stop the activity. * The participant can hold a medicine ball or dumbbell while they sit to increase the intensity.  Benefits  Wall sitting primarily builds isometric strength and endurance in glutes, calves, quadriceps, hamstrings, and adductor muscles. This also is good for people who do sports.

Early life and family Creswell was born in Gibraltar, son of Edmund Creswell (head of the postal service at Gibraltar and for the Mediterranean), and Margaret Mary Ward, née Fraser. He was educated at Gibraltar and Eastman's Royal Naval Academy, Southsea. Creswell's brother Edmund (1849–1931) played for the Royal Engineers in the first FA Cup Final in 1872. Another brother, Frederic (1866–1948) was a Labour Party politician in South Africa, who was Minister of Defence from 1924 to 1933. Naval career Beginning his naval career at the age of 13 as a cadet on the Royal Navy's training ship Britannia, Creswell was promoted to midshipman in 1867 and on 20 October 1871 became a sub-lieutenant. Having already served in the Channel Fleet, Creswell was transferred to the China Station. In 1873 while serving on the gunboat he was shot in the hip during a skirmish with pirates from the Laroot River, Penang Malaya but remained at his post. His bravery won him promotion to lieutenant but his wound meant returning to England to recuperate. Creswell's next seagoing appointment, to the East India Station, was followed by a period in Zanzibar, where he commanded a flotilla involved in suppressing the slave trade. Illness, however, again forced his return to England. Creswell retired from the Royal Navy in 1878 and, seeking to become a pastoralist, he emigrated to Australia in 1879. A stint in the Northern Territory, however, convinced Creswell that he was ill-suited to outback life. During a visit to Adelaide in 1885 he met a former naval colleague and was convinced to take up an appointment as First Lieutenant on South Australia's only naval vessel, HMCS Protector, a posting he very much enjoyed. Creswell soon began agitating for the establishment of an Australian naval force to supplement the Royal Navy squadron based in Sydney. In mid-1895, he reached the rank of captain; by 1899, he was arguing strongly for an Australian navy. On 1 May 1900, he was appointed Commandant of the Queensland Maritime Defence Force, but was soon released to command Protector on its deployment to China to assist in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion. After Federation, Creswell's lobbying for an Australian navy gained momentum. He was regarded by many as Australia's chief spokesman on naval matters, hence his appointment in February 1904 to the new position of Naval Officer Commanding the Commonwealth Naval Forces (the amalgamation of the various colonial navies). He had retained his position in Queensland and accepted the role of Naval Commandant in Victoria but his energies were primarily focused on the national navy. Alarmed at Germany's growing naval might by 1909, Australia's admiralty sought to dramatically increase Australia's naval strength. In company with Colonel Justin F. G. Foxton, Creswell attended the Imperial Conference, which resulted in the Naval Defence Act of 1910 being passed which created the Australian navy. In 1911, Creswell was promoted to rear admiral in the service of the Royal Australian Navy. As part of his coronation honours, the King made him Knight Commander of the order of St Michael and St George. The fact that Australia's navy was ready for service when the First World War began was largely the result of Creswell's hard work and lobbying. During the war he was involved as an administrator in ship construction, the development of shore support, and the arranging of convoys. After the war he worked on developing a defence program for Australia, focussing mainly on ensuring the continued strengthening of the RAN. Late life and legacy Considered the father of the RAN, Creswell retired in 1919 and took up farming in Victoria; in the same year he was created KBE. He was promoted to Vice Admiral in 1922. He died on 20 April 1933 and was survived by his wife Adelaide Elizabeth née Stow (daughter of Justice Randolph Stow) two sons and a daughter. Two sons were killed during the First World War. Captain Randolph William Creswell (1890–1917) served in the 3rd Anzac Camel Battalion, AIF and was killed in action on 6 November 1917 at Tel el Khuweifle, Palestine. He is buried at Beersheba War Cemetery. His twin brother, Lieutenant Edmund Lindsay Creswell was wounded at Bullecourt, but survived the war. Lieutenant Colin Fraser Creswell (1894–1917) was lost in the sinking of submarine E47 off the Dutch coast on 20 August 1917. Creswell has been honoured with the naming of the naval base, , the site of the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay.Macdougall 1991, p. 23.

The bridle path is a shaved or clipped section of the mane, beginning behind the ears of a horse at the poll, delineating the area where the crownpiece of the bridle lies. Bridle paths are a common style of grooming in the United States, but are not seen as often in Europe. Grooming A bridle path is usually clipped or shaved in the mane for competition in certain disciplines, and this may be done on ordinary riding horses as well. A bridle path allows the bridle or halter to lie flat on the head of the horse, which may be more comfortable. It also is thought to give the horse the appearance of a slimmer throatlatch, a generally desirable conformation trait. If the bridle path is cut too far, it can take up to 6 months for the mane to grow back to a length that allows it to lie over neatly, and as long as a year to reach its fullest possible natural length. Grooms usually start clipping the bridle path by working from the desired end of the bridle path towards the ears, as clipping from the ears backwards may result in a longer bridle path than desired. Bridle path length The length of the bridle path often varies between the equestrian disciplines and breeds. Bridle paths are common in the United States, less so in Europe. In the USA< the following standards are common: * The Hunter-type English riding disciplines, including dressage, show jumping, eventing, and hunt seat equitation, prefer a short bridle path of 1-2 inches. This length is also appropriate for certain breeds, including Thoroughbreds and Warmbloods. * Saddle seat and fine harness horses are shown with a longer bridle path of at least 8 inches. It is usually appropriate for use on breeds associated with these disciplines, even when certain individual animals are shown in-hand or under saddle in other disciplines. Breeds clipped to a \\"Saddle type\\" style include American Saddlebreds, Tennessee Walking Horses, National Show Horses, Arabians, and Morgans. * The Western riding disciplines, including the western performance disciplines such as reining and western pleasure, generally cut a bridle path that is as long as the length of the horse's ear when laid flat back against the mane, generally no more than 6 to 8 inches. Stock horse breeds, including Quarter Horses, American Paint Horses, and Appaloosas, use this style of cut. * Andalusians generally never have a bridle path longer than 1 inch. * Peruvian Pasos are sometimes prohibited to have a bridle path by certain show organizations. * Icelandic horses generally do not have a bridle path clipped.

The lake receives water from Southern California Edison's Big Creek Hydroelectric Project, as well as the many streams that flow into the lake. Some water leaving the lake flows to Big Creek, while some is diverted to nearby Shaver Lake. The lake is home to a variety of recreational activities, including camping, horse-back riding, skiing, sailing, fishing and more. It is drained and refilled through the Big Creek dam system each year, with winter water levels often dipping below 50 percent of the lake's capacity. History  Construction  Construction underway in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project in 1912. Huntington Lake was constructed in 1912 as a part of the enormous Big Creek Hydroelectric Project envisioned by John S. Eastwood to provide power for a growing California. The lake was named for Henry Edwards Huntington, the railroad magnate who financed the earliest work to develop the Big Creek project which includes a system of lakes, tunnels, steel penstocks and power houses. Four dams form the lake, which has a capacity of and a surface area of . There were originally three dams, completed in 1913, but a fourth dam, completed in 1919, was built to increase the lake's capacity. The other three dams were raised and covered with concrete. State Route 168 passes along the east shore of the lake where China Peak, a ski resort, is located. On December 6, 1943, a B-24 bomber with six men aboard crashed into Huntington Lake. The crew had taken off from nearby Hammer Field in Fresno, California to search for a second B-24 which had disappeared a day earlier during a night training flight. Two members of the original eight man crew, a radio operator and the co-pilot, bailed out of the troubled plane and survived. Some have speculated that the pilot may have mistaken the lake for a sierra meadow and tried to make an emergency landing during a snow storm. The wreckage of the plane, and the remains of its crew were discovered by a survey team in August 1955, when the lake had been drained for dam repairs. The original B-24 they had been searching for was discovered in July 1960 in Hester Lake, a small body of water in a remote area not far from Huntington. Neither plane has been recovered. The effects of the drought were drastic on the lake — peak season water levels were reduced to lower than half of normal as rainfall sharply declined.  Impact of the 2012–15 North American drought  Water levels in the lake began falling during the 2012–15 North American drought.\\"The High Sierra forest is dying, and you can't count the loss in dead trees\\". LA Times By July, 2014, the lake was at a third of its normal level, and the High Sierra Regatta was canceled for the first time in 60 years.  Recreation  Water levels and weather drastically change at the lake between summer and winter – while nearly uninhabitable in the winter, it is a popular recreation location in the summer. left Sailing Due to Huntington Lake being 5 miles long, and having steady winds of about 15MPH, it is a perfect location for sailing. Many regattas have been held there, including the North American Sailing Championships. Additionally, Huntington Lake is the site of the High Sierra Regatta, an annual sailing event organized by the Fresno Yacht Club. Fishing Anglers catch brown and rainbow trout, as well as kokanne salmon, on the lake and surrounding streams. Regulations limit the amount of fish allowed to be taken from the lake – fishers can catch and keep five fish a day, and are only allowed 10 total in possession.  Camping  There are nine campgrounds in the surrounding Huntington Lake Recreation Area – Badger Flat Campground, Billy Creek Lower Campground, Billy Creek Upper Campground, Catavee Campground, College Campground, Deer Creek Campground, Kinnikinnick Campground, Rancheria Campground, and West Kaiser Campground. West Kaiser is a first come first served site, while reservations must be made for the other eight campgrounds.  Horse-back riding  D&F; Pack Station, which offers horse-back riding trips into the Sierra Wilderness, operates on the lake. The outfit runs both quick, day trips as well as multi-day wilderness pack trips.  Snow Skiing  With snow levels often rising to over 50 inches in the winter, China Peak, located above the eastern shore of the lake, is a popular ski resort in colder months. The resort has a vertical gain of 1,679, with its peak at just over an elevation of 8,700 feet. There are seven chairlifts and over 40 ski runs. Boy Scouts alt= Due to its relative accessibility and semi-remote terrain, Huntington Lake is the location of many Boy Scout Camps, including renowned Boy Scout Camp Kern, operated by the Southern Sierra Council headquartered in Bakersfield, CA. Additionally, Huntington Lake houses Camp Oljato, operated by Pacific Skyline Council (PacSky), along with a variety of other Scouting facilities. The former Camp Mirimichi, a Boy Scout facility operated by Sequoia Council, lies at the southern eastern shore of Huntington Lake as well.  Housing  Cabins, condominiums and vacation rentals make up the real estate on the lake. There are 420 privately owned cabins – each cabin owner pays an annual fee to the United States Forest Service for a \\"special use permit\\" to use their cabin and surrounding property, as they are all built on USFS lands. Many are inaccessible in the winter except by snowmobile, while a few have their tracts plowed to the cabins.

A couple of hours later they encountered Roon and Lübeck. A short artillery duel followed. A shortage of shells forced the Russian cruisers to retreat. Fearing a possible arrival of enemy reinforcements the damaged German ships also retreated. As the German armored cruisers and sailed to reinforce the German squadron, Prinz Adalbert was torpedoed by the British submarine and limped to shore.

After Görz he went to study in Venice, and Florence.Merian:Städte und Landschaften, Band 20-21 In Florence he met the writers Scipio Slataper, Giani Stuparich, Carlo Stuparich, Umberto Saba and Virgilio Giotti. He started to write for the magazine Voce (Voice),which was then the most famous Italian magazine of its time. There he began to write his first poems in the Venetian-Friulian dialect. In 1912 he began to study in Vienna.

But Marin was eager to run to the front. Arriving in Stra nel Veneto he suffered from a relapse. When an Italian captain treated him boorishly, he protested with the words \\"Wir Österreicher sind an einen anderen Stil gewöhnt\\" \\"Captain, you are a villain; we Austrians are accustomed to different manners\\"  World War Two  In the 1940s he wrote in his diaries that he believed that only the Nazis could bring order to Europe.La pace lontana. Diari 1941-1950 by Biagio Marin, 2005, Editrice Goriziana Hearing about the Concentration Camp Risiera di San Sabba shocked and depressed him.

Career  Marin landed a position as Professor at the Scuola Magistrale in Görz, but had to leave following a dispute about his teaching method with the clergy at the school. He used the Gospel as a teaching text. Next he was employed as a school inspector in the mandate of Gradisca d'Isonzo. From 1923 until 1937 he worked as the director of the tourism agency in Grado and as a librarian.Merian:Städte und Landschaften, Band 20-21 Subsequently, he worked as a teacher of history, philosophy and literature in Triest euntil 1941. His next vocation was to be the librarian of the Assicurazioni Generali in Trieste.  Late life  In 1968 he moved back to Grado, where he resided in a house at the beach. His eyesight deteriorated, and for the rest of his life he was nearly blind and deaf After his death his private library was moved to the Biblioteca Civica in Grado.  Private life  In 1914 he married Pina Marini with whom he had four children, including Gioiella and Falco. He knew the family of Art-deco artist and designer Josef Maria Auchentaller, so well that he wrote about an affair Emma Auchentaller had when the couple visited Grado.http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts-and-culture/fine- arts/page_14/892451/part_3/lost-and-found.thtml His son Falco Marin was a poet and essayist, who died during World War Two in a fight against the Yugoslav partisans in the Province of Ljubljana, Slovenia on 25 July 1943.

The writer Claudio Magris considered himself to have been one of Biagio Marin's best friends. He also said that Marin was both brother and father to him. Immediately after the death of his friend, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Marin composed a Cycle of poems called \\"El critoleo del corpo fracasao\\" about him.Die Geheimnislosigkeit,by Peter Waterhous, Residenz Verlag, 1996, page 180  Work  Marin's poems, written in the Venetian language, are about the daily life and simple landscapes of his native land. He used the \\"lingua franca\\" that the merchants of the city used for his writings. \\"History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe: junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries\\" He was influenced by Friedrich Hölderlin and Heinrich Heine.

Gedichte, by Biagio Marin, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Andrea Zanzotto Urs Engeler Editor, Basel 1999 In 1970, the poet decided to publish all the poems written at that time in one volume, which, apropos to his sentimental attachment to his land, was titled \\"Songs from the Island.\\" His output in the 1970s gained him the attention of Italian audiences. He was now obligated to write in Italian, so that everybody in Italian could understand him. Despite this he only wrote one book in Italian called \\"Acquamarina\\" in 1973. In 1985 he said that publishers where reluctant to publish even a selection of his poetry.https://books.google.com/books?id=1hVfHLOGAxwC&pg;=PA193&dq;=Biagio+Marin&hl;=de&ei;=vQY- TMTcNI6UjAeB9sX5Aw&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=4&ved;=0CDoQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&q;=Biagio%20Marin&f;=false \\"The Cambridge companion to modern Italian culture\\"  Influence  Marin's book \\"Nel silenzio più teso\\" is in the Unesco Collection of representative works.

It is unique in that, of all of his works, it calls the most for an unexpectedly tragic, sentimental ending. Arguably, it is also Ives' only piece centered around a single character (while Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread could be similarly considered, in fact the majority of that play is an ensemble piece). Synopsis The play is divided into eight scenes or \\"variations\\", each depicting a differing final moment of Trotsky's life and making satirical allusions to soap opera conventions, The Honeymooners, and Act 5, Scene 1 from Hamlet. True to its title, the play calls for Trotsky to die at the end of each scene, and then continues on (after the ring of a bell) from near where the last scene left off, usually progressing the story a bit further each time. Since the play takes place on the day of Trotsky's death (one day after the attack) Trotsky is depicted throughout the show with a mountain-climber's axe sticking comically out of his skull (not an icepick, as is made clear a number of times). Though this is apparent to the audience from the very beginning, Trotsky himself does not realize that the axe is there until his wife, known only as Mrs. Trotsky, comes in with an encyclopedia from the future which tells of Trotsky's demise. The third and final character is introduced near the end of the play: Ramon Mercader, the Spanish assassin who \\"smashed, not buried\\" the axe into Trotsky's skull. Trotsky has a deep fear of icepicks, and is taken aback when he finds that his fear should have been directed towards mountain-climber axes. After seven essentially comedic variations, the eighth involves Trotsky seeing Mercader out of the house in a civil manner, with Ramon--having posed as a gardener--revealing that he actually did perform some gardening on Trotsky's property and requesting that Trotsky go outside to admire his nasturtiums. Trotsky then comes to grips with the facts of his impending demise, settling affairs with his wife, pondering the nature of man and humanity (\\"So even an assassin can make the flowers grow\\") and reciting some future events that he will never live to know about. Finally he declares that he is in his \\"last room\\", though Mrs. Trotsky tries to explain that he is, in fact, unconscious in a hospital. Trotsky accepts that he is fortunate just to have lived for another day after the attack--that this seems to be symbolic of some sort of hope concerning human life. He decides to go look at the garden that Ramon had tended to, but before he can, he dies for the final time.

Biography Rabbi Tarfon was a resident of Yavneh, but Jewish sources show that he also lived and taught in Lod.Ta'anit 3:9; Bava Metziah 3:3; Hagigah 18aThe Second Jewish Revolt: The Bar Kokhba War, 132-136 CE, Menahem Mor He was of priestly lineage, and he once went with his uncle on his mother's side to participate in the priestly prayer in the Temple in Jerusalem. As a priest, he would demand the terumah even after the Temple had fallen,Tosefta, Ḥagigah 3, end but his generosity made him return the money given to him as a priest in the pidyon haben ceremony.Tosefta, Bekhorot 6:14 Once, in a time of famine, he took 300 wives so that they might, as wives of a priest, exercise the right of sharing in the tithes.Tosefta Ketubot 5:1 Once, when from his window he saw a bridal procession evidently of the poorer classes, he requested his mother and sister to anoint the bride that the groom might find more joy in her.Avot deRabbi Natan 41, end His devotion to his mother was such that he used to place his hands beneath her feet when she was obliged to cross the courtyard barefoot.Kiddushin 61b Although wealthy, he possessed extraordinary modesty; in one instance he deeply regretted having mentioned his name in a time of peril, since he feared that in using his position as teacher to escape from danger he had seemingly violated the rule against utilizing knowledge of the Torah for practical ends.Nedarim 62b When Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was sick, and a deputation was sent to him, Tarfon acted as the spokesman, addressing him as follows: \\"Master, you are worth more to Israel than the sun, for that gives light only on earth, while you shed your rays both in this world and in the world to come\\".Sanhedrin 101a; Mekhilta, Baḥodesh, 11 [ed. Weiss, p. 80a] Similarly, he led a number of scholars in a visit to R. Ishmael ben Elisha, upon the death of Ishmael's sons;Moed Kattan 28b and when Jose the Galilean, Tarfon, Eleazar ben Azariah, and Rabbi Akiva assembled to decide on the disputed sayings of Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, Tarfon was the first speaker.Tosefta Gittin 7; Gittin 83a He was one of those whose names occurred in the deposition of Gamaliel II, and it is expressly stated that he was addressed as \\"brother\\" by the other scholars. On festivals and holy days, he was accustomed to delight his wife and children by preparing for them the finest fruits and dainties.Yerushalmi Pesachim 37b When he wished to express approval of anyone, he would say, \\"'A knob and a flower':Exodus 25:33 you have spoken as beautifully as the adornments of the candlestick in the Temple\\"; but when it was necessary to upbraid another, he would say, \\"'My son shall not go down with you'\\".Genesis Rabbah 91, repeating the words of Jacob to his sons in Genesis 42:38 When he perceived that his two nephews, whom he was instructing personally, were becoming careless, he interrupted his lecture and regained their attention by saying, \\"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Johanna\\"Instead of Keturah; Gen. 25:1 whereupon his pupils interrupted him by exclaiming, \\"No, Keturah!\\"Zevachim 26b His students included R. Judah,Eruvin 45b; Yebamot 101b Simeon Shezuri,Menachot 31a and Judah ben Isaiah ha- Bosem.Hullin 55b He is mentioned in the traditional Haggadah of Passover in the company of other sages: \\"It happened that Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Joshua, Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi Akiba, and Rabbi Tarfon were reclining (at a seder) in Bnei Barak (in Israel) and were telling of the exodus from Egypt the entire night...\\" Opinions differ regarding his death. According to Eichah Rabbah he became one of the Ten Martyrs, but others believe that he fled the country upon the outbreak of the Bar Kochba revolt and died elsewhere. According to a tradition from the Arizal, his grave is located in Kadita under a giant pistachio tree. However, a burial cave was recently discovered on Mount Meron and restored by the \\"Ohalei Tzaddikim\\" organization, which claims Tarfon was buried there. Elsewhere, an ossuary from a burial cave in Jerusalem has been discovered that is marked in Aramaic, \\"Elisheba wife of Tarfon.\\"Hachlili, Rachel. Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices And Rites In The Second Temple Period Teachings Halacha He was an adherent of the school of Shammai. However, only twice is he recorded as following its teachings,Yevamot 15b; Yerushalmi Shevuot 4:20 and he always inclined toward leniency in the interpretation of those halakhot of Shammai which had not actually been put into practice;Kilaim 5:6; Yebamot 15:6; Ketubot 5:2 often he decided in direct opposition to the followers of Shammai when they imposed restrictions of excessive severity.Yebamot 15:47; Nazir 5:5 In his view, \\"objective views are always the determinative criterion in reaching legal decisions. He consistently decides to the advantage of the priest, and also encourages the performance of rituals in which the priest occupies the central role.\\" He was also the author of independent halakhot, one being on the wording of the blessing after drinking water,Berachot 6:8 and another on a blessing recited at the Passover Seder.Pesachim 10:6 The majority of his rulings, however, deal with subjects discussed in the orders Nashim, Ḳodashim, Tohorot, and Nezikin. In those found in Tohorot his tendency is always toward severity, while in Neziḳin are found his sayings on lost objects and usufruct,Bava Metzia 4:3, 5:7 the payment of debts, the money due a woman when she receives a bill of divorce,Ketubot 9:2,3 and damage caused by cattle.Bava Kamma 2:5, and the baraitot connected with this passage, p-26 If he had belonged to the Sanhedrin, the death-penalty would have been abolished.Makkot 1:10; compare Frankel, \\"Der Gerichtliche Beweis,\\" p. 48, TarfonBerlin, 1846 He engaged in halakhic disputes with Rabbi AkivaKetubot 84a; Pesachim 117, 118 (however, the two agreed with regard to a toseftaMikvaot 1; Kiddushin 66; Yerushalmi Yoma 1:1; Terumot 4:5; Makkot 1:10; Keritot 5:3), with Shimon bar Yochai,Menachot 12:5; possibly, however, an error for Rabbi Akiva and R. Eleazar ben Azaryah.Yadaim 4:3 Other sayings of R. Tarfon have been preserved which were accepted without controversy.Pesachim 117a, 118a; Gittin 83a He is mentioned briefly with regard to Bruriah.Tosefta Keilim Metzia 1:3 Aggadah He was accustomed to open his aggadic discourses with a halakhic question.Tosefta Berachot 4:16 In the discussion as to the relative importance of theory and practice, Tarfon decided in favor of the latter.Kiddushin 40b In his upper chamber at Jabneh, it was decided that benevolence should be practiced according to .Esther Rabbah 6:2,5 He held that God did not allow His glory to overshadow Israel until the people had fulfilled a task.Avot of Rabbi Natan 2  Quotes  *The day is short, and the labor is plenty; the laborers are slothful, while the reward is great, and the master of the house is pressing.Pirkei Avot 2:15 *You are not obliged to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it; if you have learned much Torah, great shall be your reward, for He who hires you will surely repay you for your toil; yet the requital of the pious is in the future.Pirkei Avot 2:16 *No man dies except through idleness.Avot de-Rabbi Nathan 11:1 Attitude towards Christianity R. Tarfon, as quoted in the ToseftaTosefta Shabbat 14:4 and Talmud,Shabbat 116a swore that he would burn scrolls (either gilyonim or Torah scrolls) that came into his possession which were written by a heretical scribe, even if the name of God occurred in them. This is the strictest opinion given in the passage; Rabbi Yose said to cut out and bury the names of God while burning the rest of the scroll, while the initial anonymous opinion says such texts may not be saved from a fire on Shabbat (in general, no books other than a valid Torah scroll may be saved from a fire on Shabbat) while saying nothing about burning in general. Scholars debate whether the word minim (\\"heretics\\") here refers to heretical Jews in general, or to a particular group of them, for example Jewish gnostics or Jewish Christians. There is debate as to whether Justin Martyr's dialogue with Trypho should be taken as purporting to represent a dialog with Tarfon. The dialog itself has been held to be principally a literary device, and its claim to witness to a rabbinic perspective can be seen in that light.Lawrence H. Schiffman. 1998.

After being caught by members of the Oklahoma football staff and Biloxi, Mississippi residents, Barnes fled to hide in the house of a former LSU teammate, Elbert Manuel.

Manning (1920-1941), who was killed in action during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941. Manning was laid down by Charleston Navy Yard, on 15 February 1943; launched on 1 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. J. H. Hughes; and commissioned at the Charleston Navy Yard on 1 October 1943, Lieutenant John I. Mingay in command. Service history Solomon Islands After shakedown off Bermuda, Manning departed Charleston Navy Yard on 12 December 1943 as escort for a troopship convoy. Steaming via Panama, she reached Pearl Harbor on 1 January 1944. Five days later she sailed for the South Pacific where, after touching the Ellice Islands, she reached Florida Island, Solomons, on 21 January. During the next two months she patrolled off Guadalcanal for submarines and escorted convoys from the Solomons to the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and Samoa. In addition, she escorted a fleet oiler task group out of Espiritu Santo to an ocean rendezvous north of the Solomons. There on 26 March, the tankers refueled ships of the Fast Carrier Task Force prior to intensive raids by 3rd Fleet carriers against Japanese bases in the Carolines. New Guinea Manning departed the Solomons on 5 April and reached Milne Bay, New Guinea, the 7th to begin temporary duty with the 7th Fleet. Operating with Escort Division 37, she sailed in convoy 19 April and escorted transports and LSTs to Humboldt Bay where she arrived on the 24th. During the next two days, she screened the approaches to Humboldt Bay; thence, she returned to Cape Cretin on 29 April. After screening a reinforcement convoy to Aitape early in May, Manning continued to support the westward advance of the Allies in New Guinea. As escort for attack transports, she arrived off Wakde, New Guinea, on 17 May and screened to seaward during the amphibious invasion. She continued escort and ASW patrols along the northern coast of New Guinea until 24 June when she departed under tow to Espiritu Santo for repairs to damaged screws and shafts. Arriving on 30 June, Manning underwent repairs and overhaul during the next month. Thence, she sailed for the Solomons on 14 August, and until 9 October she made convoy escort runs out of the Solomons to the Russells, the New Hebrides, the Admiralties, and New Guinea. She arrived at Manus on 11 October; and, after reporting for duty with the 7th Fleet, sailed the 15th to support the American invasion of the Philippines. Philippines Manning steamed to Kossol Passage, Palaus, where on 20 October, she joined other escorts as a screen for tankers and ammunition ships sailing to supply ships in Leyte Gulf. She arrived off Leyte on 23 October, and for more than a week she escorted ammunition ships during replenishment operations. Between 24 and 28 October, American ships repelled numerous Japanese air attacks. Gunfire from Manning splashed a twin-engined bomber during an evening attack on 24 October, and concentrated gunfire as well as chemical smoke helped drive off enemy planes and protect American shipping in the gulf. Departing Leyte on 1 November, Manning steamed via Kossol to Humboldt Bay where she arrived the 6th. Eight days later, she joined the screen for a task group of transports, LSTs, and amphibious craft steaming via Biak to Leyte. The ships came under air attack at dusk on 23 November, but effective gunfire from the task group drove off the attackers. Manning entered Leyte Gulf early the 24th. As she screened the transport area, her 20 mm guns hit and repelled an enemy dive bomber. Manning sailed with the LSTs for New Guinea later the same day and arrived Hollandia on 30 November. As flagship for CortDiv 37, she reported for duty with Service Force, 7th Fleet, on 1 December. During the next four weeks she took part in intensive anti-aircraft and ASW exercises off New Guinea. Thence, she joined the screen for a convoy of fleet oilers and sailed on 28 December for the Philippines and the invasion of Luzon. Steaming via Leyte Gulf and Surigao Strait, Manning entered Mindanao Sea on 2 January 1945. That evening the task group repulsed enemy bombers, and during the next two days American gunfire effectively drove off additional air attacks. Manning reached Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, 4 January, and until 21 February she operated out of Mangarin Bay in support of Luzon operations. Beginning on 7 January, she screened fleet oilers during refueling of Lingayen attack ships in the South China Sea. She provided anti-aircraft and anti-submarine protection for tankers and ammunition ships anchored at Mangarin Bay, and she made ASW sweeps along the coast of Mindoro and Luzon. Thence, she returned to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 22 February and underwent tender availability until early March. Manning reported for duty with the Philippine Sea frontier on 6 March. Two days later, she sailed in the screen of a convoy bound for the Admiralties. For more than two months she escorted convoys out of Leyte to New Guinea, the Palaus, the Admiralties, and back. As U.S. ground forces, buttressed by the might of American seapower, secured control of the Philippines, Manning, in mid-May, resumed ASW patrols in the South China Sea. Operating out of Manila, she patrolled the American convoy lanes from Subic Bay to the southern tip of Mindoro during the final three months of fighting in the western Pacific. Manning completed her final patrol four days after the cessation of hostilities; and, as Japanese representatives signed the formal surrender documents on 2 September, she departed Subic Bay as escort for an Okinawa-bound convoy of LCTs and LCIs. After returning from Okinawa on 12 September, she sailed with other escorts of CortDiv 37 for the United States on 1 October. Steaming via the Marshalls and Pearl Harbor, she reached San Diego on 23 October and reported for duty with the San Diego group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Decommissioning Manning decommissioned at San Diego on 15 January 1947 and was berthed first at San Diego, and, later at Bremerton, Washington. She was declared unfit for further naval service in mid-1968, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 31 July 1968. Awards Manning received four battle stars for World War II service.

A significant population of 15℅ of Sierra Leonean Muslims are adherent to the Ahmadiyya sect of Islam.  Composition and practice  There are 16 ethnic groups in Sierra Leone, the two largest being the Temne and Mende are both Muslim majority. Ten of Sierra Leone's sixteen ethnic groups are Muslim majority. The vast majority of Sierra Leonean Muslims are Sunni of the Maliki school of Jurisprudence; while over ten percent of Sierra Leonean Muslims follow Ahmadiyya Islam, with many Ahmadiyya Muslims also adherent to the Maliki School. Though small in numbers, the Ahmadiyya has one of the largest Islamic institutions across country, including 186 primary and 55 secondary schools.  History  In the early 18th century Fulani and Mande-speaking tribesmen from the Fouta Djallon region of present-day Guinea converted many Temne of northern Sierra Leone to Islam. During the period of British colonization, attempts to spread Christianity were mostly ineffective. Islam continued to spread after independence in 1961; in 1960 the Muslim population was 35 percent and grew to 60 percent by 2000, and then to 71% in 2008. It is difficult for people from Sierra Leone to travel to Mecca for the Hajj, the fifth pillar of Islam, due to the distance between the two places and the cost of travel being beyond the means of most Sierra Leoneans. The current Ebola crisis has also made it impossible for them to obtain Visas to Saudi Arabia.

He plays accordion, percussion and other instruments. He has been a member of the bands Neutral Milk Hotel, Beirut, and A Hawk and a Hacksaw, and is a co-creator of the record label L.M. Dupli-cation. Influences on his work include music from Eastern Europe, Turkey, and the Caucasus. Career Barnes was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the son of a local businessman. In 1995 he moved to Chicago to attend DePaul University but left his studies in January 1996, aged 19. He joined Neutral Milk Hotel, which was a part of the Athens, Georgia- based Elephant 6 music collective. Neutral Milk Hotel disbanded in 1998 and Barnes spent time traveling in Europe and working as a postman. He also played with Broadcast, The Gerbils and Bablicon. Barnes cites his initial introduction to Eastern European music as having been in 1999 while on tour. After being introduced to Bulgarian music, he lived in a predominantly Ukrainian Chicago neighborhood and developed an interest in Romanian music. \\"I was kind of at a dead end in what I was listening to, and it just opened up a whole new world for me,\\" he said in a 2011 interview with Noise Narcs. \\"That was in 1999. For a while it affected the way I looked at my music, but I was still playing drums in bands, and it didn’t seem like something I should pursue. You go through these fads or trends as a listener, where you’re really into something for a month and then it changes. But with this music, it’s been now twelve years or more, and it gradually seeped into everything that I do.\\" In 2001 he formed A Hawk and a Hacksaw, in France. In 2005 he met Heather Trost, who performs with him in A Hawk and A Hacksaw. Both Barnes and Trost contributed to the debut album by Beirut, Gulag Orkestar. A Hawk and A Hacksaw's recording and touring line-up over the years has included Hungarian, Romanian, and English musicians, notably Fanfare Cioclaria, Ferenc Kovacs, Balász Unger, Chris Hladowski, and Kalman Balogh. One recent touring iteration included Chicagoans Samuel Johnson, who played trumpet, and George Lawler on the doumbek. Barnes and Trost are married and live Albuquerque. They created the label L.M. Dupli-cation to release their own recordings as well as music by other folk-related groups. Barnes has said he intends to release contemporary music as well as earlier music that is no longer available. They have released home recordings by John Jacob Niles, an album of Turkish wedding music by Cüneyt Sepetçi and Orchestra Dolapdere, and a compilation of music from the Caucasus Mountains, called Mountains of Tongues. Barnes and Deerhoof guitarist John Dieterich released duo album called The Coral Casino, under the moniker Dieterich & Barnes in Spring of 2016. In the Fall of 2016, Barnes released a collection of solo recordings, called Summer '16 In Neutral Milk Hotel, Barnes played a four-piece C&C; drum kit (24-inch bass drum) Paiste Giant Beat and Istanbul Agop Cymbals, and a Wurlitzer MLM organ.

During the American Civil War, he served as Acting Secretary of State for the Confederacy in 1862 and as a temporary brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. When he was not confirmed to that rank by the Confederate Senate, he reverted to his permanent grade of colonel. Early life Browne was born in County Mayo in Ireland on July 7, 1823 as (apparently the fifth) son of D. Geoffrey Browne, MP. Definite information about some events, positions or locations in his early life, including an uncertain higher education, alleged service in the British Army during the Crimean War, diplomatic services and his initial whereabouts in the United States during the early 1850s, appears to be unavailable.Coulter, pp. 1-2 Residing in New York City by 1855 or 56, he wrote for the New York Journal of Commerce. He associated with the Democratic Party and later became a clerk in the House of Customs. In 1859 Browne moved to Washington D.C. and wrote for the pro-administration Washington Constitution.Coulter, pp. 2-6 American Civil War Browne in uniform In 1861 Browne, known as Constitution Browne by then, had become a well-connected proponent of secession and moved to Athens, Georgia, after that. A favorite of both the just elected Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his Secretary of State Robert Toombs he was appointed Assistant Secretary of State. On several occasions in 1861 and 62 Browne acted as interim Secretary.Coulter, pp. 80-85 Living in Richmond, Virginia with his wife, Eliza Jane Beket, he had two permanent houseguests. One was Howell Cobb, a former United States Secretary of the Treasury and an old and close friend from Washington, who now was the President of Provisional Confederate Congress. The other was his younger brother, Colonel Thomas R.R. Cobb.Coulter, p. 93 Browne resigned in March 1862 and was assigned as military aide-de-camp to President Davis, with the rank of a Colonel of cavalry.Coulter, p. 92 Beside his main duty on the staff he also was assigned to command a battalion of local defense cavalry.Coulter, p. 99 On April 5, 1864 Davis appointed Browne as Commandant of Conscription in Georgia, where Governor Joseph E. Brown consistently hindered the Confederate war efforts. Browne was a natural choice as a Georgia resident who had inspected and reported about the conscription in Georgia before.Coulter, pp. 102-103, 109 In late 1864 Browne, while still enforcing conscription, was detached to commanded a small brigade of reserves during the Savannah Campaign. In December, Browne was promoted to temporary brigadier general, to rank from November 11, 1864. He resumed his conscription duty in January 1865. In February 1865 his promotion was not confirmed by the Confederate Senate and he reverted to colonel. Despite this he later was excluded from amnesty on grounds of being both a civil officeholder and a military officer ranking higher than colonel.Coulter, pp.115-120 He was paroled on May 8, and pardoned either in late 1865 or 66.Coulter, pp. 125-127 Later life Afterwards Browne, back in Athens, studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1866. Beside his practice of law he became a newspaper man again when he took over editorship of the Southern Banner in 1868. Despite his position, the Brownes suffered from relative poverty and fragile health.Coulter, pp. 128-129, 132 He was the great-great- uncle of Sir Robert Ricketts, 7th Baronet of Gloucestershire England.

The lightly armed Irish soldiers, besieged in Jadotville (modern Likasi), resisted Katangese assaults for five days as a relief force of Irish, Indian and Swedish troops unsuccessfully attempted to reach the Irish force. The outnumbered Irish company was eventually forced to surrender after ammunition and supplies were exhausted, but not before inflicting heavy casualties on the Katangese and their mercenaries. They were held as prisoners of war for approximately one month, with no loss of life. Background The Shinkolobwe mine by Jadotville was described by a 1943 Manhattan Project intelligence report as the most important deposit of uranium yet discovered in the world. The uranium from this mine was used to build the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. On Wednesday 13 September 1961, United Nations forces in Katanga launched a military offensive, that was code named Operation Morthor, against mercenary military units serving the State of Katanga, which had seceded from Congo-Léopoldville in July 1960. According to its mandate, the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) forces were to remain strictly impartial in the conflict. But the Katangese political leadership believed the UN had broken its mandate and its forces were siding with their opponent, the Congolese central government. Soon after the start of Morthor, the Katangese led a counterattack on an isolated UN military unit based at the mining town of Jadotville, approximately 100 kilometers up-country from the main UN base in Elisabethville. A contingent of 155 Irish UN troops, designated \\"A\\" Company, commanded by Commandant Pat Quinlan, had been sent to the mining town, ostensibly to assist in the protection of its citizens. The foreign minister of Belgium had called the UN secretary-general, reporting that Belgian settlers and the local population were unprotected, and feared for their safety. Radio operator of \\"A\\" Company in the months prior to the siege But when the Irish troops arrived at Jadotville, they were not welcomed by the local people, due to strong pro- Katangese and anti-UN feeling. Two previous companies of ONUC peacekeepers — one Swedish and one Irish — had been withdrawn from Jadotville in the days prior to the arrival of Quinlan's force. It is not clear why the Katangese wanted to isolate the Irish UN troops, although some commentators have suggested that the goal may have been to take the Irish as prisoners for leverage in negotiations with the UN. Battle At 07:40 on the morning of Wednesday 13 September 1961, the Katangese attacked while many of the UN Irish troops were attending an open-air mass. Expecting to take the men off guard, the first attackers moved in rapidly but were spotted by an Irish sentry. A warning shot by Private Billy Ready alerted the company to the threat (Ready was wounded in a later exchange of fire). A five-day battle ensued. A combined force of mercenaries, Belgian settlers and local tribesmen attacked the Irish. The attackers had a strength of 3,000–5,000 men, mostly Katangese and settlers, but with many Belgian, French and Rhodesian mercenaries armed with a mix of light and heavy armament. They also had air support from a Fouga Magister trainer jet, fitted with underwing bombs and machine guns. For the most part, the Irish UN soldiers were armed with only light personal weapons, a small number of water-cooled Vickers machine guns and 60mm mortars. A number of days later, the besieged Irish radioed to their headquarters: \\"We will hold out until our last bullet is spent. Could do with some whiskey\\". The Katangese attacked in waves of 600 or so, preceded by bombardment from 81mm mortars and a French 75mm field gun. The Irish soldiers successfully defended against successive waves of attackers from their positions. The Irish Support Platoon knocked out most of the Katangese mortar and artillery positions with accurate counter-battery fire from 60mm mortars. After withstanding four days of repeated attacks, the Irish fired on identified Katangese mortar and machine- gun positions with several hours of continuous and concentrated fire from their own mortars and machine guns. The fire from the UN Irish positions proved accurate and effective. Mercenary officers were reportedly observed shooting native gendarmes to stem the rout caused in Katangese lines. The Katangese asked Quinlan for a cease-fire, as their forces had been seriously diminished. By this time their effective strength may have been reduced to 2,000 men. Quinlan agreed. Irish ONUC troops in the Congo in 1960 (a year prior to the siege) The 500 Irish and Swedish UN troops based in Kamina, and Indian army Gurkhas (seemingly 3rd Battalion, 1 Gorkha Rifles) made several attempts to relieve the besieged Irish soldiers. 3rd Battalion, 1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment) was operating as part of 99th Indian Infantry Brigade during Morthor. Nambiar, Sundaram, Chhina, 'For the Honor of India: A History of Indian Peacekeeping,' Centre for Armed Forces Historical Research, USI of India, New Delhi, , 2009, 201, 217. The supporting force of mercenaries, many of them French, German, Belgian and South African veterans of the Algerian War almost to a man beat back these efforts. They had been brought in by Moïse Tshombe, Katanga's premier, whose secessionist government had been supported by Belgium. A series of battles took place at a pinch point called the Lufira Bridge. It carried the Jadotville-to-Elisabethville Highway across the Lufira River. The Katangese forces dug in here and brought heavy and sustained ground and air fire onto the relief column, killing several Indian UN troops, injuring a number of Irish UN troops and ultimately forcing the column off the bridge. \\"A\\" Company, 35th Battalion, suffered five wounded in action during the siege. The Katangese, on the other hand, suffered heavy losses. Up to 300 were killed, including 30 mercenaries, and an indeterminate number were wounded, with figures ranging from 300 to 1,000. Quinlan, however, had no access to resupply and reinforcements and, with his transport destroyed by the Fouga Magister jet, a breakout was virtually impossible. At one stage in the conflict a mission to bring in water by air was successful, but due to the use of contaminated containers (previously used to store petrol) the water was largely undrinkable. Quinlan lacked any clear direction or communication from his superiors, and the Katangese gradually infringed on the cease-fire agreement to undermine \\"A\\" Company's position. In the end, with his position untenable, without any clear orders or promise of assistance, having run out of ammunition and food and low on water, Quinlan accepted the second offer to surrender to the Katangese on the afternoon of Sunday 17 September. The Irish soldiers were held as hostages for approximately one month, in an effort to extort terms of ceasefire that were embarrassing to the United Nations. The Katangese and their mercenary allies bartered the Irish soldiers for prisoners in the custody of the Congolese government of Joseph Kasa-Vubu. After being released, the troops were returned to their base in Elisabethville. Some weeks later, however, \\"A\\" Company found itself involved in active combat again, this time with the support of Swedish UN troops. Eventually they were reinforced with fresh troops from Ireland (their replacement was the 36th Battalion). After weeks of fighting and their six-month tour of duty now complete, \\"A\\" Company was rotated out of the battle zone and were home in Ireland that December. Aftermath Fouga Magister similar to the one used by the Katangese during the siege Inaccurate reports of the deaths of several Irish soldiers circulated in the media at the time of the attacks. Some analysts suggest that the Belgian Fouga pilot mistook bed rolls for body bags as he overflew the battlefield. Until the early 21st century, the Irish state did not give much recognition to the battle of Jadotville. The term \\"Jadotville Jack\\" was sometimes applied as a term of derision about the Irish Defence Forces. After the incident no Irish soldier received any decoration for his actions at Jadotville, although Quinlan recommended a number of his men for the Military Medal for Gallantry (MMG), Ireland's highest award for military valour, for their actions during the battle. In 2016 the Irish government awarded a Presidential Unit Citation to \\"A\\" Company, the first in the State's history. Although \\"A\\" Company, 35th Battalion had tactically defeated a larger enemy force at Jadotville, the Irish Defence Forces' leadership did not overtly acknowledge the battle. There may have been perceived shame that \\"A\\" Company had surrendered, or because of political and strategic errors demonstrated at higher levels. Quinlan eventually retired as a full colonel but never served overseas again. The Irish officers who fought at Jadotville found that it was best for one's career not to mention the battle. According to RTÉ, \\"Commandant Quinlan's action is cited in military textbooks worldwide as the best example of the use of the so-called perimeter defence\\". The veterans of Jadotville were dissatisfied that the Defence Forces refused to acknowledge the battle and that there was an implied black mark on the reputation of their commander. A number of Irish soldiers, who had been involved in the siege, reputedly took their own lives in later years. Quinlan, who died in 1997, had his public reputation restored nine years after his death. John Gorman, a retired soldier who had been a 17-year-old private during the fight, campaigned to have the Battle of Jadotville recognized. In 2004 Irish Minister for Defence Willie O'Dea agreed to hold a full review of the battle. A Defence Forces inquiry cleared Quinlan and \\"A\\" Company of allegations of soldierly misconduct. A commemorative stone recognising the soldiers of \\"A\\" Company was erected on the grounds of Custume Barracks in Athlone in 2005. A commissioned portrait of Quinlan was installed in the Congo Room of the Irish Defence Forces' UN School. In October 2017 a plaque commemorating Quinlan was unveiled in his native County Kerry, by former Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The decision of the state to honour the soldiers of Jadotville or their next of kin was one of the last decisions taken by Enda Kenny before he retired as Taoiseach in June 2017. They were presented with special medals in Athlone on 2 December 2017. In popular culture Declan Power's history, The Siege at Jadotville: The Irish Army's Forgotten Battle (2005), was adapted as the film, The Siege of Jadotville (2016). The cast includes Jamie Dornan and Mark Strong, and the movie had a \\"well received\\" premiere at the 2016 Galway Film Festival. It had a limited cinematic release in September 2016, and worldwide release on Netflix, on 7 October 2016. A radio documentary on the siege was broadcast on RTÉ Radio 1 in 2004.

The springs drain into Rider Creek, which in turn drains into Cougar Reservoir. They are about a quarter mile from Forest Service Road 19, also known as Aufderheide Memorial Drive. The hot springs are managed by American Land & Leisure. Visitors over the years built up four pools out of river stones. The pools' sizes range from across and deep. The water source is above the topmost pool where the spring flows from a rock face at approximately . The pools are on a hillside and cascade from one to the next so that each pool step lower is cooler than the one above it. The pool floors are mostly bedrock but some gravel, sand and debris remain at the bottom of the pools. The pools are closed Thursday mornings for weekly cleaning by the concessionaire. The pools were renovated in 2009. A group of volunteers, led by a Eugene-based stonemason, removed concrete and built pools using a natural mortar. The new walls will be more stable and easier for volunteers to clean. The renovated pools, the construction of which cost an estimated $40,000, are expected to last for generations. Access to the springs is subject to a fee. Since 2012, the rates have been $6 per person per day or $60 per person for a seasonal pass to visit. Clothing in the bathing areas is optional, and access is permitted for day use only. Pets are not allowed at the pools, but there is a designated area before the pools where pets can be tied up. On December 21, 2017 a landslide blocked the road that provides access to the hot springs from the north. The road will be closed indefinitely. At the time, southern access was blocked by winter road conditions and construction, making the hot springs inaccessible to the public. On August 19, 2018 a fire was reported in the area near Terwilliger Hot Springs. The fire damaged the trail to the springs and the surrounding area. The hot springs were re-opened on July 1, 2019.

Turf grass It is considered a southern turf type lawn grass and turns brown in the winter. This makes it a lesser grass for northern climate lawns. It is shade tolerant and tends to spread aggressively once established. Because of its durability in moderately cold temperatures and invasive bug species, this grass can be used to protect certain crops in the American southeast. Ecology This species is eaten by the bug Stenodema vicinum, and is also eaten by cattle and other hoofed herbivores. The seeds can be distributed by sticking to animal hoofs or shoes.Muhlenbergia schreberi, Native Plant Database, University of Texas at Austin Nimblewill grows in light sun and partial shade, and prefer a loamy soil and moist conditions.

They are supernatural beings that live in nature. They look and behave similarly to humans, but live in a parallel world. They can make themselves visible at will. In Faroese folk tales,See:  hidden people are said to be \\"large in build, their clothes are all grey, and their hair black. Their dwellings are in mounds, and they are also called Elves.\\" Some Icelandic folk tales caution against throwing stones, as it may hit the hidden people.

There is, however, some evidence that the two terms have come to be taken as referring to two distinct sets of supernatural beings in contemporary Iceland. Katrin Sontag found that some people do not differentiate elves from hidden people, while others do. A 2006 survey found that \\"54% of respondents did not distinguish between elves and hidden people, 20% did and 26% said they were not sure.\\"  Origins  Terry Gunnell writes: \\"different beliefs could have lived side by side in multicultural settlement Iceland before they gradually blended into the latter-day Icelandic and .\\" He also writes: \\" and undoubtedly arose from the same need. The Norse settlers had the , the Irish slaves had the hill fairies or the Good People. Over time, they became two different beings, but really they are two different sets of folklore that mean the same thing.\\" Precursors to elves/hidden people can be found in the writings of and in skaldic verse. Elves were also mentioned in Poetic Edda, and appear to be connected to fertility. The Christianization of Iceland in the 11th century brought with it new religious concepts. According to one Christian folk tale, the origins of the hidden people can be traced to Adam and Eve. Eve hid her dirty, unwashed children from God, and lied about their existence. God then declared: \\"What man hides from God, God will hide from man.\\" Other Christian folktales claim that hidden people originate from Lilith, or are fallen angels condemned to live between heaven and hell. In succession of Christianization, official opposition to dancing may have begun in Iceland as early as the 12th century, and the association of dancing with elves can be seen as early as the 15th century. One folktale shows the elves siding with the common people and taking revenge on a sheriff who banned dance parties. concludes that these legends \\"show that Icelanders missed dancing\\". In the 13th and 14th centuries, books from mainland Europe reached Iceland, and may have influenced folktales about elves. writes: \\"Round about 1600 sources for hidden folk become so voluminous that we can readily define the beliefs and legends about them, and after that there is one source after another about them right down into the twentieth century.\\" According to Árni Björnsson, belief in hidden people grew during the 17th and 18th centuries when Iceland was facing tough times.  Holidays  There are four Icelandic holidays considered to have a special connection with hidden people: New Year's Eve, Thirteenth Night (January 6), Midsummer Night and Christmas night. Elf bonfires () are a common part of the holiday festivities on Twelfth Night (January 6). There are many Icelandic folktales about elves and hidden people invading Icelandic farmhouses during Christmas and holding wild parties. It is customary in Iceland to clean the house before Christmas, and to leave food for the on Christmas. On New Year's Eve, it is believed that the elves move to new locations, and Icelanders leave candles to help them find their way. On Midsummer Night, folklore states that if you sit at a crossroads, elves will attempt to seduce you with food and gifts; there are grave consequences for being seduced by their offers, but great rewards for resisting.  Icelandic and Faroese folklore  Several scholars have commented on the connections between hidden people and the Icelandic natural environment. B.S. Benedikz, in his discussion of Jón Árnason's grouping of folktales about elves, water-dwellers, and trolls together, writes: \\"The reason is of course perfectly clear. When one's life is conditioned by a landscape dominated by rocks twisted by volcanic action, wind and water into ferocious and alarming shapes... the imagination fastens on these natural phenomena.\\" Ólina Thorvarðardóttir writes: \\"Oral tales concerning Icelandic elves and trolls no doubt served as warning fables. They prevented many children from wandering away from human habitations, taught Iceland's topographical history, and instilled fear and respect for the harsh powers of nature.\\" Michael Strmiska writes: \\"The are... not so much supernatural as ultranatural, representing not an overcoming of nature in the hope of a better deal beyond but a deep reverence for the land and the mysterious powers able to cause fertility or famine.\\" claims that in a landscape filled with earthquakes, avalanches, and volcanoes, \\"it is no wonder that the native people have assigned some secret life to the landscape. There had to be some unseen powers behind such unpredictability, such cruelty.\\" Alan Boucher writes: \\"Thus the Icelander's ambivalent attitude towards nature, the enemy and the provider, is clearly expressed in these stories, which preserve a good deal of popular—and in some cases probably pre-christian—belief.\\" Robert Anderson writes that syncretism \\"is active in Iceland where Christianity, spiritism, and Icelandic elf lore have syncretized in at least a couple instances.\\" Terry Gunnell notes that hidden people legends recorded in the 18th and 19th centuries showed them to be \\"near mirror-images of those humans who told stories about them—except they were beautiful, powerful, alluring, and free from care, while the Icelanders were often starving and struggling for existence. The seem in many ways to represent the Icelander's dreams of a more perfect and happy existence.\\" Anthropologist claimed that hidden people tales told by 19th-century Icelandic women were a reflection of how only 47% of women were married, and \\"sisters often found themselves relegated to very different functions and levels of status in society... the vast majority of Icelandic girls were shunted into supporting roles in the household.\\" He goes on to say that these stories justified the differences in role and status between sisters, and \\"inculcated in young girls the... stoic adage never to despair, which was a psychological preparedness many would need as they found themselves reduced in status and denied the proper outlet for their sexuality in marriage, thereby sometimes having to rely on infanticide to take care of the unsolicited and insupportable effects of their occasional amours, an element... related in stories.\\" contends that the hidden people symbolize idealized Icelandic identity and society, the key elements of which are seeing the \\"past as a source of pride and nature as unique and pure.\\" Hidden people often appear in the dreams of Icelanders. They are usually described as wearing 19th-century Icelandic clothing, and are often described as wearing green. In one version of modern Faroese folklore, the hidden people vanished in the 1950s when electricity was brought to the island.  Contemporary Iceland  A survey of Icelanders born between 1870 and 1920 found that people did not generally believe in hidden people and that when they had learned about supernatural beings in their youth, those lessons had mostly been made for amusement. About 10% seemed to actually believe in hidden people. A survey from 1974 showed that among those born between 1904 and 1944, 7% were certain of the existence of hidden people. Several modern surveys have been made showing a surprising number of believers. Around 7–8% claim to be certain that elves exist, and around 45% claim it is likely or possible. These surveys have been criticized as being misrepresentative, as journalists have claimed that they show that a majority of Icelanders believe in elves, despite belief not being that serious. Folklore professor Terry Gunnell has said: \\"Very few will say immediately that they 'believe' in such, but they won't deny it either.\\" Different ways of asking could elicit very different responses. Árni Björnsson claims the beliefs are simplified and exaggerated for the entertainment of children and tourists, and that it is a somewhat misrepresentative yet harmless trick used by the tourism industry to entice visitors. The stories of elves may have been fun tales rather than beliefs.  Tourism  The Icelandic Elf School in organizes five-hour-long educational excursions for visitors. offers a \\"Hidden Worlds tour\\", a guided walk of about 90 minutes.

The driver placed the blame on elves living in a large rock. Despite locals not having been aware of any elves living in the rock, newspapers ran with the story, thus starting the myth that Icelandic road construction was often impeded by elves. In 1982, 150 Icelanders went to the NATO base in to look for \\"elves who might be endangered by American Phantom jets and AWACS reconnaissance planes.\\" In 2004, Alcoa had to have a government expert certify that their chosen building site was free of archaeological sites, including ones related to folklore, before they could build an aluminium smelter in Iceland. In 2011, elves/ were believed by some to be responsible for an incident in where rocks rained down on residential streets.

Taken 1863, in Washington D.C. Lean Bear (Cheyenne name Awoninahku, 1813–1864), alternatively translated as Starving Bear, was a Cheyenne peace chief.Ricky 182 He was a member of the Council of Forty-four, a tribal governance devoted to maintaining peace with encroaching United States settlers. Lean Bear's most notable peace deals include the Treaty of Fort Wise and a meeting with US President Abraham Lincoln. His work towards peace between his people and the American settlers in the Southern Plains was cut short when he was killed by the 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment and violent retaliations ensued.  Personal life  Lean Bear suffered from vertigo, which commonly ran in the family. During a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, he suffered an attack and spoke while seated in a chair. Lean Bear brushed it off as a result of him simply being too nervous to stand. Relations Lean Bear had a brother called Bull Bear. In 1864, Bull Bear was the leader of the Dog Soldiers, a position he would hold for many years. Lean Bear also worked closely and served on the Council of Forty-four with fellow peace chief Black Kettle, especially in the last decade of his life.  Political life  The first known historical account of Lean Bear is from 1851. He was roughly 35 at this time. Agent Thomas Fitzpatrick was hosting a council in Fort Atkinson to convince plains tribes to attend a larger peace council at Fort Laramie later on. The Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, Arapaho, and Cheyenne people went out to meet the soldiers and each other. They feasted and traded goods. Fitzpatrick spoke with each group, and eventually convinced the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes to attend the next peace council. The other tribes refused, wary about bringing their horses up north near tribes that were notorious for stealing horses. The troops were beginning to leave as the council ended when Colonel Sumner arrived at Fort Atkinson on his way to New Mexico. He stayed for a few days to trade and obtain some horses from the tribes in attendance. After some time, the tribes began to freely explore both the fort and his camp, and Fitzpatrick grew nervous at the opportunities for conflict. Lean Bear, who was in attendance at the peace council, was fascinated by the rings and bracelets on the hand of Sumner's wife and grabbed to get a better look. She reacted by pulling her hand back and screaming, provoking Sumner to rush forward to beat Lean Bear. Because Cheyenne culture considers striking even a male child to be an insult, Lean Bear was incredibly indignant about the assault. He painted his face and rode around his camp announcing his plans to attack the whites, inviting his brothers to join him. Fitzpatrick initially refused to make reparations until some Kiowas and Comanches told him that the Cheyennes were getting ready to attack. A meeting was later arranged for Colonel Sumner to present Lean Bear with a blanket in apology, which he accepted. Council of Forty-Four Lean Bear was chosen to join the Council of Forty-four by past chiefs, as the council chose its own successors. The council worked to sway their people towards a preference for peace with the Americans. Once named a chief of the council, one would have to give up membership in the war societies that new chiefs often came from. These efforts contrasted with the increasingly vocal Dog Soldiers, bands of Cheyennes who held a longstanding opposition to white settlement and did not wait to cooperate and make peace. They stole livestock and fought with troops and settlers. The Dog Soldiers were exiled for their behavior and deemed renegades, operating independently of the tribe. Nonetheless, their provocative nature caused a lot of trouble for the peace-seeking Cheyennes. Treaty of Fort Wise On October 1857, Chief Lean Bear and three other Cheyenne chiefs approached William Bent with concern about attacks on his people by Sumner's troops along the Republican River. Bent then sent a letter to Washington D.C. on their behalf, stating that the Cheyenne chiefs would like to speak with someone from the government. The response came in 1860, when Commissioner A.B. Greenwood met the chiefs at Fort Wise. Chief Lean Bear was one of the principal signers in the Treaty of Fort Wise in 1861. This treaty was made with Cheyenne and Arapaho chiefs, cutting roughly 40 million acres of land from their territory. There were mixed responses to the deal, including scorn from the Dog Soldiers, because only six Cheyenne chiefs were present to sign the treaty, when all forty-four are typically needed when treaties and alliances are being made. The deal was made in an attempt to keep peace as pioneers spread near Indian territory, but the land reduction and the continued encroachment by white settlers only heightened tensions. The Cheyennes were not ready to forced into the confines of the small reserve, where there were not many buffalo, allocated for them in the treaty.  Meeting in Washington D.C.  The delegation of chiefs meeting with Lincoln on March 27, 1863. Lean Bear is believed to be one of the people in the lower left of the image. On March 27, 1863, a delegation of chiefs and two women met with President Abraham Lincoln in the East room of the White House. The meeting was called after skirmishes with Native tribes and white settlers created fear that southern plains tribes would side with the confederacy. Lincoln was hoping to persuade Native Nations to either ally with the Union, or pledge neutrality. Lincoln welcomed the chiefs, explaining that white Americans had conquered an expansive population, territory, and wealth that white Americans had gained. Lean Bear implored the president to stop his white Americans from being violent so that Indians and whites alike could travel across the plains without risk. Lincoln told the chiefs that their Native people were naturally more tempted to violence. He further explained that in order to survive and be prosperous, the Native Americans would have to adopt methods of cultivating the land that were more similar to the way of the whites. Lincoln also requested that the southern Plains Indians remain neutral in the American Civil War, ready to provide peace medals to those that he could reach an agreement with. The chiefs complied, promising to uphold peace treaties and not align with the confederacy. Lean Bear then made a request to the president to expedite his and the other chiefs' journey home. Murder of Lean Bear On May 16, 1864, less than 15 months after meeting Lincoln in Washington, Lean Bear, Black Kettle, and others in the tribe were camping on their buffalo hunting grounds near Ash Creek. The 1st Colorado Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant George Eayre, approached the group. Although there had been a fight around a month previous involving Cheyenne Dog Soldiers at Fremont's Orchard, Lean Bear was confident that the violence wouldn't be associated with his peaceful tribe and was not concerned as the soldiers got closer. Positive that this would be a peaceful encounter, Lean Bear went alone to meet the militia to show his peaceful intentions. On his chest, Lean Bear proudly wore his peace medal that he had received on his trip to Washington D.C. in 1863. In his hand, he held an official document signed by President Lincoln stating that he was peaceful and friendly with whites. What Lean Bear did not realize was that Eayre's troops were operating under orders from Colonel John M. Chivington to \\"kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found.\\" Eayre ordered his men to shoot Lean Bear, who was wounded and fell off his horse. He was then shot repeatedly by the soldiers as they rode past his body on the ground. The troops rode on to attack other Cheyennes at the camp, killing at least one more warrior and wounding many others at the camp. Cheyenne warriors armed themselves and mounted their horses, ready to retaliate. Black Kettle rode out to de-escalate the situation, stopping any further violence, and the American troops retreated to Fort Larned. Aftermath of the killing Rising tensions caused by the death of Lean Bear, along with Eayre's other Indian camp raids, is heavily attributed to the Sand Creek Massacre that occurred six months later. Lean Bear's brother, Bull Bear, was livid after the killing and felt compelled to violence against the white men, a desire he had never felt before. Bull Bear remarked that his brother had died while trying to keep peace with the settlers, and he expected to die in the same way. He called for war but was shot down at a meeting with Wynkoop, the Fort Lyon Commander, on September 10, 1864. Despite Black Kettle's best efforts to keep the peace, attacks by Native warriors in the Southern Plains skyrocketed as the vengeful tribes burned ranches and trails, kidnapping settlers and their livestock. Over time, the Dog Soldiers' popularity rose, and they overrode Black Kettle's efforts to resist war. The Governor of Colorado issued a proclamation giving each citizen permission and encouragement to retaliate by killing any Indians and seek compensation for stolen property. Legacy There are no confirmed images of Lean Bear. There are only images and paintings of the full room in 1863 when the delegation went to meet president Lincoln. There are many differing accounts on the identities of each chief in the image. In common usage by sources about Lean Bear is an image of a Cheyenne peace chief who is typically believed to be Lean Bear. Parts of Lean Bear's life are described in the book of folklore, By Cheyenne Campfires, compiled by George Bird Grinnell. Notes References * Ricky, Donald B. \\"Indians of Nebraska.

It lies just north of the Martin Mere Wetland Centre and to the south of North Meols about six miles east of the Irish Sea coast at Southport. The village's position on the West Lancashire Coastal Plain lends it very fertile soil; unsurprisingly, agriculture (primarily of vegetables, though also some grain) is the economic mainstay of the village. Some smaller- scale pastoral farming is also seen, too. In contrast to the more northerly villages around Banks, Holmeswood has remained largely undeveloped, although it is conveniently placed for commuting to the nearby towns of Southport, Preston, Burscough and Ormskirk. For local matters, the village falls under Rufford Parish Council. The village lies almost wholly on the B5246, which runs from Mere Brow to Rufford. As befits an agricultural village of its size, Holmeswood has a small village hall (now home to the village nursery school), Methodist primary school and a bowling and tennis club. Geography Architecture Holmeswood Hall stands among the dark woods between the villages of Mere Brow and Holmeswood. Thomas Hesketh, son of Nicholas Hesketh, was born at Holmeswood Hall in 1406.http://www.heskethbank.com/history/bulpit/bulpitrfd.html The present Holmeswood Hall was built in 1568 which is the date given on the 1847 Ordnance Survey map at Lancashire Records Office.Ordnance Survey Map, published 27 December 1847, Captain Tucker and Captain Stanley. This makes the building a grade II listed building. The Hesketh family being the owners of Rufford Old Hall, re-built the present hall as a hunting lodge. The rise or 'brow' in approaching the hall is the ancient bank of Martin Mere. It can be seen today as a wood between Mere Brow and the hall itself the road is the ridge of the bank.

Successive fortresses were built in Visby (borg means fortress or castle), though Visborg is usually in reference to the castle built here by King Eric of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.  History  Duke Eric (son of King Magnus III of Sweden) appears to be the first to construct a fortress in the southwest corner of Visby in 1310 as part of a struggle between his brothers for control over the kingdoms of Sweden and Norway as well as Danish claims on Gotland; this brings Gotland under Norwegian control. When King Magnus IV, son of Duke Eric, becomes King of Norway and Sweden it falls under his control. In 1356 King Magnus gives control of Norway to his son, King Haakon VI Magnusson, though Magnus still remains as King of Sweden. In July 1361 Danish forces, under King Valdemar Atterdag, land in Gotland and crush and seize Visby on 27 July, killing at least 2000 peasants. The following year, 1362, Swedish Nobles revolt and declare Haakon King of Sweden. The following year is defining for the future of Scandinavia. In 1363 Haakon and Magnus reconcile and Haakon marries Margaret (Queen Margaret I of Denmark), the daughter of Valdemar; father and son agree to share the throne of Sweden. The nobles again rise up and offer the crown to Magnus's nephew Duke Albert of Mecklenburg. In 1375 King Valdemar of Denmark dies and Margaret ensures that her and Haakon's infant son, Olaf (Olav) is named heir to the throne. Only five years later, in 1380 her husband Haakon, King of Norway, dies making Olaf heir apparent to both thrones of Norway and Denmark upon his becoming of age; until that time his mother acts as Queen Regent to both nations. However, in 1387 Olaf dies, and Margaret becomes ruler of Denmark and Norway. In 1388 King Albert is driven from Sweden for Margaret to assume the throne. After a failed counter- assault by Albert in 1389, Albert and his son are taken prisoner. Margaret is named ruler of Sweden which angers the Mecklenburg Dukes. This marks the formation of the Kalmar Union that unifies the three crowns. In an attempt to destabilize Denmark, the Mecklenburg's hired the Victual Brothers, pirates, to disrupt trade in 1392. They used Visby on Gotland as their fortress from which they were a costly menace to all members of the Hanseatic League. In 1395, after a treaty with the Mecklenburg's, Albert is released with the understanding that he will turn Stockholm over to Margaret in three years. Margaret and Albert give Gotland to the Teutonic Order, with the pledge that the order will remove the Victual Brothers and their fortress in Visby. Konrad von Jungingen, the Grand Master of the Order, takes the Island in 1398 and destroys Visby. In 1397 Margaret passes rule of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark to her grandnephew Eric of Pomerania. In 1408 the Teutonic Knights sell Visby to Erik. Three years later he begins construction of Visborg Castle, the most famous of the Visborg fortresses. In 1430 the Kalmar Union begins to fall apart. King Eric initiates a number of policies that upset nobles in all three of his kingdoms. Hostilities between the king and the nobles escalate until 1439 when Eric is deposed by Karl Knutsson Bonde (later king Charles VIII of Sweden) in Sweden and by King Christopher III, Erik's nephew, in Denmark; Eric was offered the throne of Norway alone, but declined. In response he took up permanent residence in Visborg Castle, but he never relinquished his claim to the throne, though by 1440 he had no power outside of Gotland. Christopher reigned as sole monarch of the Kalmar Union until he died in 1448 without an heir. Swedish nobles took the opportunity to make Karl Knuttsson king of Sweden and Norway; and a Dane named Christian I King of Denmark. This began a long period of warfare between the kings of Denmark and Sweden over who would once again rule over the three kingdoms of the Kalmar Union. With tensions rising, Gotland became an immediate point of conflict. In 1448 Charles launched an invasion of the island and was able to secure all but Visby because of the fortifications at Visborg, still inhabited by the deposed King Eric. Eric made a deal with Christian I in 1448, because they were family, in which he agreed to cede Gotland to the Danes and renounce his claims to the throne in return for safe passage to Pomerania. Christian agreed and in 1449 a Danish army reinforced the defenses of Visborg by sneaking in under cover of darkness. As the Danes moved in the Swedes evacuated the island. As promised Eric was given safe passage to Pomerania where he ruled the Duchy of Stolp as Eric I until his death in 1459. Despite numerous challenges, Denmark retained continuous rule of the island until a peace treaty signed in 1645 granted it to Sweden for 30 years. Denmark gained it back in 1676, but three years later Denmark signed another peace treaty with Sweden in which they agreed to return Gotland. As the Danish soldiers were leaving Visby that year, they blew up the fortress of Visborg. Some fragments of its structure still can be seen in overlooking the harbor of Visby.  After the Fortress  Model of the fortress, Visby. Prince Oscar of Sweden, Duke of Gotland and second in line to the Swedish throne, married without his father's permission, thereby relinquishing his right to succession and royal titles. On 2 February 1892 he was made the first Count of Wisborg by his mother's (Sophia of Nassau) brother Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg with reference to the old fortress of his former dukedom. Including Oscar there have been four such counts created, three of them Oscar's grandnephews in the 20th century, all former Swedish princes heirs who lost their throne for marrying without the King of Sweden's consent.  Trivia  Some versions of F. W. Murnau's 1922 classic horror film Nosferatu take place in Bremen, Germany. In fact the original work of Murnau was supposed to be set in Wisborg (the better restorations of the movie use Wisborg, some of the worst use Bremen and Bram Stoker's names for the characters). The discrepancy results from the work being pieced together from various versions after translation in various countries. The work was filmed in Delft, the Netherlands and Slovakia, so it isn't clear why Bremen was chosen by the later inter-title makers – Bremen doesn't have a beach to explain some of the scenes in Nosferatu. That being said, Murnau's selection of Wisborg is unexplained as well. It is unclear whether he was using Wisborg since no city actually exists with the name or if he understood the relation to Visborg and the town name holds a deeper significance.

Sam Shepherd of musicOMH went as far as to claim that the song uses the opening chords to Led Zeppelin's \\"Ramble On\\" in its main riff. In a review for Blabbermouth.net, Keith Bergman likened the instrumental breakdown in the middle of the song to The Doors track \\"Riders on the Storm\\". The music video for \\"White Unicorn\\" is made up of footage from Wolfmother's performances at Big Day Out and Homebake festivals in 2005, edited by Kris Moyes. According to Steven Gottlieb of VideoStatic, \\"Most of the camera angles emanate from behind the band to convey just how big these guys are down under, while various color effects give the clip a slight psychedelic feel\\". Speaking about the lack of a director credit on the video, Moyes claims that \\"Since I was asked to do this as a favour I decided not to have a producer/director credit\\". Shortly after the original video's release, a \\"defaced version\\" featuring various overlaid sketches was released. The defacing was originally credited to \\"Bandito Bruce\\", a 16-year-old Wolfmother fan \\"with no connection to the band or label\\". However, Moyes later revealed that he himself had produced the version, noting that he was inspired by the work L.H.O.O.Q., a defaced reproduction of the Mona Lisa by artist Marcel Duchamp. Reception In reviews of Wolfmother, some critics praised \\"White Unicorn\\" as one of the album's highlights. Writing for the website PopMatters, Adrian Begrand claimed that it \\"emerges as the clear winner on the entire disc, neatly marrying the hippy-dippy sentiment of Robert Plant and the monstrous chords of Tony Iommi before briefly returning to the acid rock sounds of Hawkwind again\\". Adam Webb of Dotmusic highlighted the song as the prime example of the band's songwriting ability, while The Observer columnist Ben Thompson recommended it as one of two (alongside \\"Pyramid\\") highlights of the record. At the end of 2005, Australian radio station Triple J included \\"White Unicorn\\" at number 84 on its Hottest 100 list, the lowest position of the six Wolfmother tracks featured on the list.

He was sent to Spain to promote the proposed Spanish Match between Charles, Prince of Wales, and the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna of Spain, for which mission he was knighted. He left England after being accused of leading Catholics in 1641 and retired to Ghent. Life Matthew was the son of Tobias Matthew, then Dean of Christ Church, later Bishop of Durham, and finally Archbishop of York, by his marriage to Frances, a daughter of William Barlow, Bishop of Chichester. (father and son article) Matthew matriculated from Christ Church on 13 March 1589/90 and graduated MA (Oxon) on 5 July 1597. Because of his youthful extravagance, he is said to have been treated harshly by his parents. On 15 May 1599, he was admitted a member of Gray's Inn, where he began his close friendship with Francis Bacon. Two years later, Matthew was elected as Member of Parliament for Newport, in Cornwall. During this time, he was a frequent visitor to the court of Elizabeth I. In 1604, shortly after the accession of James I, Matthew was elected again to the House of Commons, this time by St Alban's, and joined James's court. He also received a large grant from the Crown which provided for his future. Having always desired to travel, Matthew left England in November 1604 and travelled through France to Florence, even though he had promised his father he would not go to Italy. In Florence, he met several Roman Catholics and eventually converted to that denomination from Anglicanism. At that time a new persecution of \\"Papists\\" was raging in England, but Matthew was determined to return. When he arrived, he was imprisoned in the Fleet for six months and every effort was made to make him recant his conversion. In the end, he was allowed to leave England and travelled in Flanders and Spain. In 1614, whilst in the entourage of Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, he studied for the priesthood at Rome and was ordained by Cardinal Bellarmine on 20 May.E. Chaney, The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion (Geneva, 1985) and idem, The Evolution of the Grand Tour (Routledge, 2000). In 1617, James allowed Matthew to return to England and he stayed for some time with Bacon. During this time he wrote an introduction to the Italian translation of his friend's Essays. Matthew was exiled again from 1619 to 1622, but was favorably received by James upon his return. He acted as an agent at court to promote the marriage of Charles, Prince of Wales (later Charles I) with the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna of Spain. For promoting this cause, the ill-fated \\"Spanish Match\\", James sent Matthew to Madrid and knighted him upon his return on 20 October 1623. As a member of the immediate circle of the new queen consort, Henrietta Maria, Matthew enjoyed the same favour at court under Charles I as he had under his father. Under a charming and playful guise — he offered to prepare for Henrietta Maria the new Spanish drink of chocolate, and did so, but absent-mindedly testing it, he tasted it all up —C.V. Wedgwood, The King's Peace, 1637–1641 (1956:123). he labored diligently for the Roman Catholic cause there. At the time of Anne Blount, Countess of Newport's conversion to his faith, which was considered scandalous. He was falsely accused of converting her, but others had actually assisted her. Matthew absented himself from the court. After the Civil War broke out in 1640,he was again falsely accused. Matthew, by now in his sixties, left England for the last time in 1641. He took refuge with the English Jesuits at their house at Ghent. Whilst he was there he became the spiritual adviser to the Abbess, Elizabeth Knatchbull, there. He admired her and wrote her biography that was later published in 1931. He died in Ghent. Whether or not Matthew himself ever became a Jesuit remains a matter of controversy to this day. Notes Works Matthew translated St. Augustine's Confessions (1620), the Autobiography of St. Teresa (1623), and Father Arias's Treatise of Patience (1650). Matthew himself authored A Relation of the death of Troilo Severe, Baron of Rome (1620), A Missive of Consolation sent from Flanders to the Catholics of England (1647), A True Historical Relation of the Conversion of Sir Tobie Matthew to the Holie Catholic Faith (first published in 1904), as well as some manuscript works. His letters were edited by Dr John Donne in 1660.

Founded in 1797, it is one of the oldest secondary schools in the United States. It is a member of the Eight Schools Association, the Ten Schools Admissions Organization, and the Six Schools League. Overview It is a four-year college-preparatory school with approximately 650 students and about 125 faculty, all of whom live on or near campus during the school year. Deerfield had a 16.8% acceptance rate for the 2019–20 school year. Its endowment is $590 million. The Academy grants $10.8 million per year to 36% of its students, meaning the average financial aid grant is $50,096 per year. The student body hails from 38 U.S. states and 38 foreign countries. As of 2017, 32% of the student body were nonwhite American domestic students, and an additional 12% were foreign nationals or US expats. History Deerfield Academy was founded in 1797 when Massachusetts Governor Samuel Adams granted a charter to found a school in the town of Deerfield. It began to educate students in 1799. The school was prestigious, and graduates occupied many congressional and gubernatorial seats in New England. By the end of the 19th century, industrialization had economically hurt Deerfield, which was rural. The board of trustees was considering closing the Academy, as only nine students remained. In 1902, Deerfield appointed Frank Boyden as headmaster. Boyden also emphasized athletics as a component of education, sometimes playing on varsity squads that lacked players. Boyden retired in 1968. David M. Pynchon was appointed headmaster after Boyden. He expanded the curriculum, updated the school buildings, and expanded the endowment. In 1989 the Academy reestablished coeducation, which Boyden had discontinued in 1948. At the time male students had protested the decision.Quinn, Laura. \\"When Prep School Goes Coed Following The Lead Of Many Other Private Schools, Lawrenceville Finally Broke With Tradition To Admit Girls .\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. March 20, 1988. Retrieved on July 3, 2014. \\"When the boys at Deerfield Academy, the prestigious Massachusetts prep school, stormed out of their cafeteria several weeks ago to protest the school's decision to admit girls for the first time, there were young men at the Lawrenceville School here who grumbled in sympathy.\\" Eric Widmer '57 served as headmaster from 1994 to 2006. He stepped down in June 2006 and soon after assumed the position of Founding Headmaster at King's Academy in Madaba, Jordan, a school inspired in part by HM King Abdullah II's Deerfield years in the 1980s. It opened in the fall of 2007. Margarita Curtis, previously Dean of Studies at Phillips Andover, was the first woman to hold the position of Head of School at Deerfield Academy, retiring in 2019. The current Head of School is Dr. John Austin, former Head of School at King's Academy in Amman, Jordan.https://newbostonpost.com/around- new-england/new-deerfield-academy-headmaster-led-school-in-jordan/ Some notable alumni include Conor Kennedy, the son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr and former boyfriend of Taylor Swift. Another notable alumni is Abdullah II, the king of Jodrdan.  Academics  Deerfield Academy follows a trimester system, in which the school year is divided into three academic grading periods. Deerfield students take a full liberal arts curriculum, including English, history, foreign language, mathematics, laboratory science, visual and performing arts, and philosophy and religion. However, required courses are kept at a minimum to allow students to take more courses in the subjects that interest them most. Most courses last the entire year, whereas others can last for one to two terms. The required course load is five graded courses per term, but students may petition the Academic Dean to take a sixth graded course if desired. There are no Saturday classes, and classes are held from Monday to Friday, typically from 8:30 am to 3:05 pm. On Wednesdays, classes end at 12:45 pm to accommodate athletic events, as well as to provide more time for clubs and community service. Deerfield does not rank students. Academic work is graded on a scale where the minimum passing grade is 60 and the median grades are between 85 and 90. A trimester average of 90.0 or above garners Honors distinction, whereas a trimester average of 93.0 or above garners High Honors distinction.  Matriculation  Well over a quarter of Deerfield students matriculate into the Ivy League, MIT, and Stanford. The most-attended colleges from 2001-2016 were Yale, Georgetown, Dartmouth, UVA, and Harvard. Co-curricular activities Old Deerfield Sycamore American Elm Students are required to participate in a co-curricular activity each trimester. Some options include competitive or intramural sports, community service, dance, theatrical productions every term, yearbook, and many more.  Music  Music facilities include the Elizabeth Wachsman Concert Hall, a professional recording studio, and numerous rehearsal and practice rooms. In recent years, Deerfield music students have excelled in competition, winning first prize in the Springfield Symphony Orchestra's Rhodes Solo Concerto Competition (2019), the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra's Solo Competition (2019), and the Boston Symphony Orchestra's Solo Concerto Competition (2019), as well as placing second in the J.Y. Park Piano Competition at Western Connecticut State University (2019). Participants of the program have been accepted to competitive music training programs that include the Perlman Music Program, Meadowmount School of Music, Heifetz International Music Institute, and Bowdoin International Music Festival. Deerfield musicians have matriculated at Harvard and Stanford Universities, among others. Athletics Deerfield athletic teams compete with boarding schools and other private schools throughout New England. Deerfield is also a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC).

In 2009 Salisbury defeated Deerfield 7-6, resulting in a shared New England Championship title. In 2010 Salisbury defeated Deerfield 9-6. Salisbury went on to win the New England title. However, in 2011 Deerfield beat Salisbury 11-7 in the penultimate game of their season. Deerfield went on to beat Exeter in the last game of their season, securing both an undefeated season and the New England title. They secured the ranking of number one in the state of Massachusetts, and a ranking of number three in the nation. Deerfield's golf, men's water polo, and swimming teams are strong. In 2008 Deerfield held the New England Prep School Championship title for men's swimming, men's water polo, and golf.  Extracurricular activities  In addition to required co- curricular activities, many students are involved in at least one of the more than 50 student-run clubs or organizations. Traditions  Hike to the Rock  Each fall, the Head of School hikes with all the freshmen to the Rock, which is a ridge overlooking the Pocumtuck Valley. Students return many times to the Rock throughout their time at Deerfield, and a trip to the Rock is one of many seniors' last activities. The fastest time ever recorded was by Chijioke Achebe '21 and Mathew Panikar ‘21, who made it all the way to the top of the rock in under 2 hours.  Sit-down meals  Seven times a week, the entire Deerfield community gathers in the Dining Hall for a family-style meal. Each round table consists of nine students and one faculty member. After every Sunday night dinner, the entire student body sings the Deerfield Evensong.  Choate Day  \\"Choate Day\\" occurs during the final weekend of the fall sports season. Deerfield competes with Choate in every sport at both varsity and sub- varsity levels. The tradition began in 1922 with an exchange of letters between Deerfield head Frank Boyden and Choate head George St. John. Since then, busloads (in the early years, trainloads) of students have made the 80-mile journey along the Connecticut River valley to cheer their teams on the rival's campus. In the days leading up to the event, rallies and activities are held at both schools. And each campus is decorated in spirited banners and signs to excite the students during the week leading up to the events. At Choate the Boar Pen cheerleaders are selected and a fire-breathing dragon is ignited. At Deerfield in the Main Auditorium, the cheerleaders put on skits mocking their opponents, and there are speeches given by Captain Deerfield, the step team, and the head cheerleaders. In the athletic building, the school seal is encircled by students so that Choate athletes will not tread on it. When events at the Auditorium end, the student body rushes to the lower fields where a bonfire, topped by a burning C, awaits it. Captain Deerfield, the varsity captains, and the cheerleaders rile up the student body with Deerfield cheers and chants.Alford-Hamburg, Grace, \\"Deerfield Day, A History of Rivalry and Tradition,\\" The News, November 11, 2011; James Chung, \\"Choate Day,\\" The Deerfield Scroll, November 7, 2012  Stepping-Up Bonfire  The Stepping-Up Bonfire is an event that takes place during the night of Commencement day, after the graduating senior class has departed from campus. Students gather on the Lower Fields and celebrate the coming year in a bonfire. This event is also the place of the debut of the new Captain Deerfield and an opportunity for the Junior Cheerleaders to take the lead. The bonfire has been followed up by a dance for the rising seniors.  School Meeting  Every Wednesday morning, the entire student body and faculty gather in the Hess Auditorium. Students sit by year, and after each class shouts its own cheer, students sing the Deerfield fight song. School Meetings contain announcements, student performances, and invited speakers.

Since 2015, all 100 incoming ninth-graders have been housed together in the Ninth-Grade Village, which consists of two single-sex dormitories connected by a large common room. Deerfield Academy Press The Deerfield Academy Press was founded in May 1997 with the publication of Deerfield 1797-1997: A Pictorial History of the Academy, the first written history of the school. The press also provides an outlet for student writings in English, history, and foreign languages. Faculty sexual abuse and Deerfield's response In 2004 an alumnus revealed to Deerfield's then headmaster Eric Widmer that he had been sexually abused in the Winter of 1983 by faculty member Peter Hindle. Widmer responded sympathetically but did not press for details. The school was aware a parent previously raised concerns about Hindle in the 1980s, and had responded with written and verbal warnings. Nearly a decade later in 2012 the alumnus raised the matter again, this time with headmaster Margarita Curtis, who he says \\"displayed clear moral authority and offered unconditional support from the start.\\" An investigation by the school's lawyers confirmed the allegations and uncovered more: In late March 2013 the school published information that two former faculty members had engaged in multiple sexual contacts with students: Peter Hindle who taught at the school from 1956 to his 2000 retirement, and Bryce Lambert who retired in 1990 and had died in 2007. The school stripped Hindle's name from an endowed mathematics teaching chair and a school squash court, and barred him from campus events. A subsequent criminal investigation by the District Attorney's office revealed that at least four teachers, three deceased and one still alive, had engaged in sexual conduct considered \\"criminal in nature\\" with students extending back into the 1950s. Their deaths, and the statute of limitations, precluded pursuing criminal charges. Deerfield spokesman David Thiel said “I think you saw from us an amount of transparency when this came to light that was unusual, and I hope that sets a good example for institutions and helps to assure that students are safer everywhere.”  In books and popular culture  In the book The Headmaster (1966), author John McPhee reviews the life and work of Deerfield's most famous, formative headmaster, Frank Boyden, last of the \\"magnanimous despots who... created enduring schools through their own individual energies, maintained them under their own absolute rules, and left them forever imprinted with their own personalities.” McPhee spent a year at Deerfield as a postgraduate student. John Gunther's book Death Be Not Proud (1949) discusses the long struggle of his son John Gunther Jr. (called \\"Johnny\\") a Deerfield student, against a deadly brain tumor. The ovation Deerfield students gave the boy as he managed to walk the church aisle to receive the diploma he had earned despite the ravages of the disease is a powerful—and heartbreaking—scene. The book was later made into the 1975 movie Death Be Not Proud, starring Robby Benson as Johnny Gunther. In Martin Scorsese's film The Departed (2006), William \\"Billy\\" Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is said to have attended Deerfield during his youth, though he was expelled for \\"whaling on a gym teacher with a folding chair.\\" Deerfield alumnus and later Horace Mann School history teacher Andrew Trees wrote a satiric novel titled Academy X (2007), a tale of corrupt \\"transcript primping\\" set in an unnamed prep school. After publication of the novel Horace Mann declined to renew Mr. Trees' teaching contract. The resulting controversy over academic freedom was reported in a New York Times article, \\"Private School, Public Fuss\\".

In 1812, he was a lieutenant. In 1813, he led the infantry in the defense of Zacapu. In November 1816, now a colonel, he was taken prisoner at Fort Monteblanco, near Córdoba, Veracruz. He was freed under a general amnesty, even though he refused to give his word that he would not fight again against the viceregal government of New Spain. In 1821, after Mexican independence, he supported the Plan de Iguala, which resulted in Agustín de Iturbide ascending the throne as Mexico's first emperor. However, as a congressional deputy he did not support this result, since he was a republican. He and other deputies proposed that Iturbide be declared a traitor. During the rebellion against the emperor, he joined the Plan de Casa Mata, but he did not have the confidence of the leaders, who considered him a radical. Republic of Mexico In 1823 to 1824, he was supreme political chief of the Province of Mexico. On 2 March 1824, the new Mexican Congress changed his title to governor of the State of Mexico. He returned for a second period as governor of the state from 26 April to 1 October 1830. He was also general of a division under President Guadalupe Victoria and military commandant of Puebla. In Puebla, together with General Filisola, he rose against President Vicente Guerrero on 10 December 1828 (Plan de Jalapa). Múzquiz was initially defeated by José Joaquín de Herrera, but the rebellion was successful. He was one of the individuals who offered the presidency to Anastasio Bustamante. Acting president In 1832, when Antonio López de Santa Anna revolted, President Bustamante left the capital to fight the rebels, leaving Múzquiz as acting president (14 August 1832 to 26 December 1832). Neither Bustamante nor Santa Anna could prevail. Manuel Gómez Pedraza assumed the presidency on 24 December as the result of an agreement between the warring factions (Convenios de Zavaleta) and a congressional resolution, after 11 months of fighting. Múzquiz was the first president to collect taxes on doors and windows. Later career and death In 1836, he was president of the Supremo Poder Conservador, an institution of five members established under the Seven Laws with the power to dissolve Congress or the Supreme Court. He was a candidate for president in 1843, but Santa Anna won the office. He died in December 1844, in poverty, remembered for his scrupulous honesty in the management of public funds. He was buried with full honors in the Cemetery of Santa Paula. Múzquiz was officially benemérito de la patria en grado heroico, an honor bestowed by Congress.

These weapons are set off by (fuses) that are activated when the weapon strikes the ground or something equally hard, such as a concrete building. In the context of a nuclear weapon, a ground burst is a detonation on the ground, in shallow water, or below the fallout-free altitude. This condition produces substantial amounts of nuclear fallout. An air burst or a deep subterranean detonation, by contrast, makes little fallout.  Ground shock  Ground shock, or water shock will result from nuclear explosions on (or near) the surface of ground or water. The ground shock can damage or destroy hardened structures. In water, the shock is damaging to nearby vessels and may also produce a surface wave to limited ranges. A crater is formed by an explosion at (or near) the ground surface. The size of the crater depends on the type of ground material and how close to the ground surface the explosion occurs.

Born in Alkmaar, North Holland, he started performing in Italian before switching to Dutch in 1994. He has consistently been one of the most successful and biggest grossing artists in the Netherlands for the past twenty years. Biography Marco Roberto Borsato was born in the Wilhelmina Hospital in Alkmaar as the son of Roberto Borsato and Mary de Graaf. He has a brother, Armando, and a sister, Sylvana. The family moved to Italy, where the father started a restaurant in Garda. Borsato spent a significant amount of time in Italy and speaks fluent Italian. When Borsato was 12 years old he decided he wanted to be a sushi chef. Borsato, though brought up with Italian cuisine, felt a great love for this cuisine. When he was older he went to school during the week and worked in a restaurant during the weekends. During his conscription he was bound to the cavalry, where he was conscripted as a NCO. Success did not come over night after winning the Dutch Soundmixshow on 6 April 1990 with his rendition of Billy Vera's \\"At This Moment.\\" During that time he was indeed working as a chef. Borsato was one of the artists who recorded the song Shalom from Holland (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991. Borsato released 3 albums with Italian songs, before gaining popularity in 1994 with his first Dutch single \\"Dromen Zijn Bedrog\\" (\\"Dreams Are Deceptive”) which reached number one and stayed there for 12 weeks. His second single \\"Waarom Nou Jij\\" also reached the first place in the Dutch \\"Top 40.\\" Biografie – Borsato. Borsato.nl. Retrieved on 2014-03-20. Many of his songs are Dutch covers or adaptations of Italian songs (by Riccardo Fogli, Giorgia, Riccardo Cocciante, Claudio Baglioni, Marco Masini and Zucchero among others). In particular, Borsato gained a lot of success in 1996 with an adaptation of Riccardo Cocciante's Margherita. After deciding to keep singing in Dutch, Borsato's career really took off. In 2009, Borsato was dealt a financial blow when his company The Entertainment Group, a major events organiser and Dutch artists representer, was declared bankrupt by a Dutch court. In 2011 he became a judge on the Dutch talent show The Voice of Holland and The Voice Kids. He is currently tied with Blake Shelton of The Voice as the highest-times winning coach in any The Voice version throughout the world, with 4 winners in The Voice of Holland and 3 winners in The Voice Kids. Borsato married Dutch TV personality Leontine Ruiters and they have 3 children together: Luca (1998), Senna (2001), and Jada (2002). In February 2020 the couple announced their divorce. In 2019, he released a song with Davina Michelle and Armin van Buuren called \\"Hoe het Danst\\" it broke records across The Netherlands and Belgium and managed to receive international coverage Other functions Borsato is an ambassador of the Dutch NGO War Child, which helps children in (post-)conflict areas to cope with their war experiences.

There were 3 crewmen aboard: pilot Jabez A. Richards, 49, of Bayhead, New Jersey; Daniel W. Hennessy, 33, of Hillsborough, California, as co-pilot, and Paul M. Entz, 37, of North Hollywood, California, as flight engineer. On Wednesday, December 23, 1964, Flying Tiger Line Flight 282 arrived at San Francisco International Airport from Japan. Filled with a cargo of electronic equipment, bolts of fabric, women's scarves, bandannas, purses, and costume jewelry for the Christmas holiday, the craft was refueled and then departed just after midnight with a crew of three, of cargo, of mail, and 5,000 gallons of high-octane aviation fuel. The weather was heavy fog and rain. A large cold front was moving onshore; it had already caused the loss of a Coast Guard helicopter. Going northwest from San Francisco Bay, Flight 282 was to head out over the ocean to circle and gain altitude, then travel east toward its destination of JFK International Airport in New York City. Shortly after takeoff, however, the plane veered to the left of its planned course. The pilot subsequently asked the tower for permission to change his radio setting from takeoff to departure frequency. Seconds later, the plane vanished from the tower's radar scope. The \\"Super Connie\\" crashed near the top of Sweeney Ridge in San Bruno, very close to the site of a Coast Guard radio station. All three crew members aboard were killed. No one on the ground was killed or injured. The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was that the pilot, for undetermined reasons, deviated from departure course into an area of rising terrain, where downdraft activity and turbulence affected the ability of the craft to climb.

He is a member of the academic advisory council for climate change denialist pressure group The Global Warming Policy Foundation, a member of Australians for Northern Development & Economic Vision (ANDEV), and was an allied expert for the Natural Resources Stewardship Project. Plimer is a fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, the Australian Institute of Geoscientists and the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy; an honorary fellow of the Geological Society of London; a member of the Geological Society of Australia, the Royal Society of South Australia, and the Royal Society of New South Wales.  Business career  Plimer is the former non-executive director of CBH Resources Limited from 1998 to 2010, former non-executive director of Angel Mining plc from 2003 to 2005, former director of Kimberley Metals Limited from 2008 to 2009, former director of KBL Mining Limited from 2008 to 2009 and former director of Ormil Energy Limited from 2010 to 2011. He is currently the non-executive deputy chairman of KEFI Minerals since 2006, independent non- executive director of Ivanhoe Australia Limited since 2007, chairman of TNT Mines Limited since 2010, non-executive director of Niuminco Group Limited (formerly DSF International Holdings Limited) since 2011, and non-executive director of Silver City Minerals Limited since 2011. Plimer was appointed director of Roy Hill Holdings and Queensland Coal Investments in 2012. According to a columnist in The Age, Plimer earned over $400,000 (AUD) from several of these companies, and he has mining shares and options worth hundreds of thousands of Australian dollars. Plimer has stated that his business interests do not affect the independence of his beliefs. He has also warned that the proposed Australian carbon-trading scheme could decimate the Australian mining industry. Views on climate change Plimer accuses the environmental movement of being irrational, and says that the vast bulk of the scientific community, including most major scientific academies, is prejudiced by the prospect of research funding. He characterised the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as: \\"The IPCC process is related to environmental activism, politics and opportunism\\" and \\"the IPCC process is unrelated to science\\". He is critical of greenhouse gas politics and says that extreme environmental changes are inevitable. Climatologists consider him a skeptic on climate change who misrepresents their data. Other geologists, such as Donald Prothero, have reached conclusions different from Plimer's after reviewing similar data. Volcanoes and CO2 Plimer has said that volcanic eruptions release more carbon dioxide (CO2) than human activity; in particular that submarine volcanoes emit large amounts of CO2 and that the influence of the gases from these volcanoes on the Earth's climate is under-represented in climate models.\\"Professor Ian Plimer has long argued that large volcanic eruptions will release more carbon into the atmosphere than human-induced activity...\\"Plimer, Ian, Heaven and Earth: Global Warming – The Missing Science, Conner Court Publishing (2009), pp. 207–225. The United States Geological Survey has calculated that human emissions of CO2 are about 130 times larger than volcanic emissions, including submarine emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that Plimer's claim \\"has no factual basis.\\" This was confirmed in a 2011 survey published in the Eos journal of the American Geophysical Union, which found that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are 135 times larger than those from all volcanoes on Earth. Heaven and Earth In 2009, Plimer released Heaven and Earth, a book in which he says that climate models focus too strongly on the effects of carbon dioxide, and do not give the weight he thinks is appropriate to other factors such as solar variation. The aim of the book is to belittle the impact of humans on Earth by clouting all the other science like a blunt instrument, as in Plimer's words \\"I wanted to kill an ant with a sledgehammer.\\"Van Tiggelen, John (6 March 2010). \\"Climate of doubt\\", Good Weekend, Sydney Morning Herald, pp24 Critics of the book have accused Plimer of misrepresenting sources, misusing data, and engaging in conspiracy theories. Some critics have also described the book as unscientific, and said that it contains numerous errors from which Plimer draws false conclusions. Copenhagen Climate Challenge During the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 (COP15), Plimer spoke at a rival conference in Copenhagen for climate change deniers, called the Copenhagen Climate Challenge, which was organised by the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. According to The Australian newspaper, Plimer was a star attraction of the two-day event. In closing his speech, Plimer stated that \\"They’ve got us outnumbered, but we’ve got them outgunned, and that’s with the truth.\\" El Niño, earthquakes and sea levels Plimer has stated that El Niño is caused by earthquakes and volcanic activity at the mid-ocean ridges and that the melting of polar ice has nothing to do with man-made carbon dioxide. Plimer told Radio Australia that Pacific island nations are seeing changes in relative sea level not because of global warming but quite commonly due to other factors, such as \\"vibration consolidating the coral island sands\\", extraction of water, and extraction of sand for road and air strip making. Political influence In 2009, Plimer was cited by the leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, Tony Abbott, in dismissing the IPCC and its findings. But by 2011, Abbott had modified his position and stated that climate change is real and humanity makes a contribution to it. In early 2010, Plimer toured Australia with British climate change denier Christopher Monckton, giving lectures on climate change, and Plimer's views came to be associated with Monckton's claim that the international left created the threat of catastrophic global warming. On this association, left-wing columnist Phillip Adams commented: \\"Praise the lord for Lord Monckton! For Ian Plimer! For [conservative columnist] Andrew Bolt! Not only does this evil axis of scientists tell lies [about the Greenhouse Effect] but they've also doctored the weather to frighten people with huge droughts, cyclones and tsunamis to prove what they now call 'global warming'.\\" Plimer's book Not for Greens expanded his view. Climate scientist Ian McHugh has disputed a number of the scientific claims in the book. Critic of creationism Plimer is an outspoken critic of creationism and is famous for a 1988 debate with creationist Duane Gish in which he asked his opponent to hold live electrical cables to prove that electromagnetism was 'only a theory'. Gish accused him of being theatrical, abusive and slanderous. In 1990 Plimer's anti-creationist behaviour was criticised in Creation/Evolution journal, Updated at TalkOrigins in an article titled \\"How Not to Argue with Creationists\\" by skeptic and anti-creationist Jim Lippard for (among other things) including false claims and errors, and \\"behaving poorly\\" in the 1988 Gish debate. Book: Telling Lies for God In his book Telling Lies for God: Reason vs Creationism (1994), Plimer attacked creationists in Australia, in specific the Queensland-based Creation Science Foundation (now called Creation Ministries International or CMI), saying that claims of a Biblical global flood are untenable. In the book he also criticised aspects of traditional Christian belief and literal interpretations of the Bible, with chapters titled \\"Scientific Fraud: The Great Flood of Absurdities\\" and \\"Disinformation Doublespeak\\". Court case In the late 1990s, Plimer went to court alleging misleading and deceptive advertising under the Trade Practices Act 1974 against Noah's Ark searcher Allen Roberts, arising from Plimer's attacks on Roberts' claims concerning the location of Noah's Ark. Before the trial, Plimer was removed by police from public meetings at which Roberts spoke. The court ruled that Roberts' claims did not constitute trade or commerce, and so were not covered by the act. It found that Roberts had indeed made false and misleading claims on two of 16 instances cited by Plimer, Plimer had failed to show the other 14, and the two were minor enough to not require remedy. Plimer lost the case, and was ordered to pay his own and Roberts' legal costs estimated at over 500,000 Australian dollars.

Chuck Hull, the CTO and former president, invented stereolithography in 1986.U.S. Patent 4,575,330 (“Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography”) The company creates product concept models, precision and functional prototypes, master patterns for tooling, as well as production parts for direct digital manufacturing. It uses proprietary processes to fabricate physical objects using input from computer-aided design and manufacturing software, or 3D scanning and 3D sculpting devices. 3D Systems' technologies and services are used in the design, development and production stages of many industries, including aerospace, automotive, healthcare, dental, entertainment and durable goods. The company offers a range of professional- and production- grade 3D printers as well as software, materials, and the online rapid part printing service On Demand. It is notable within the 3D printing industry for developing stereolithography and the STL file format.  History  3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent- holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology. In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine. Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President. In 2005, 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move. In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson. On April 4, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO. On May 14, 2020, the 3D Systems board named Jeff Graves as President and CEO, effective May 26.  Growth  In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers pointed to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create- to-print chain. 3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, the company has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and \\"remove expert/user friction between content creation and print.\\" In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to \\"contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders.\\" Note: the first page of the 9 page transcript is available without registration. One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.

In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.http://www.actionfigureinsider.com/3d-systems-acquires-gentle-giant- studios/ Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three- dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12\\" figures and models. In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for . In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies. The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven. The takeover added Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations. In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a full-color printer using the fused deposition modeling technique. botObjects was founded by Martin Warner (CEO) and Mike Duma (CTO).\\"3D Systems Acquires 3D Printer Maker botObjects and Introduces CubePro® C Full-Color 3D Printer\\". January 5, 2015 botObjects created a desktop 3D printer for the consumer which used Fused filament fabrication to create full-color 3D printing. botObjects' proprietary 5-color CMYKW cartridge system\\"An Exclusive Look At The BotObjects ProDesk3D Color 3D Printer\\". February 5, 2014 could generate color combinations and gradients by mixing primary printing colors. There was some skepticism about botObjects' claims. In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.By Chris Lange, 24/7 Wall St. “3D Systems Hopes Acquisition in China Will Help.” April 6, 2015. April 6, 2015.  Technology  3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three- dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer- by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications. * Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes. * Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times. * Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation. * Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available. *Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications. * Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.  Products and patents  As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons. 3D Systems is a closed- source company, using in-house technologies for product development and patents to protect these technologies from competitors. Critics of the closed- source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry. Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product. In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”Rob Giseburt, 3D Systems Suing Formlabs and Kickstarter for Patent Infringement, Make:, 21 November 2012. The legal procedure lasted more than two years and was significant enough for Netflix to add it to its documentary about 3D printing called \\"Print the Legend\\". 3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support- object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.  Applications and industries  3D Systems’ products and services are used across industries to assist, either in part or in full, the design, manufacture and/or marketing processes. 3D Systems' technologies and materials are used for prototyping and the production of functional end-use parts, in addition to fast, precise design communication. Current 3D Systems-reliant industries include automotive, aerospace and defense, architecture, dental and healthcare, consumer goods and manufacturing. Examples of industry-specific applications include: * Aerospace, for the manufacture and tooling of complex, durable and lighter-weight flight parts * Architecture, for structure verification, design review, client concept communication, reverse structure engineering, and expedited scaled modeling * Automotive, for design verification, difficult visualizations, and new engine development * Defense, for lightweight flight and surveillance parts and the reduction of inventory with on-demand printing * Dentistry, for restorations, molds and treatments. Invisalign orthodontics uses 3D Systems' technologies * Education, for equation and geometry visualizations and art schools and design initiatives * Entertainment, for the manufacture and prototyping of action figures, toys, games and game components; printing of sustainable guitars and basses, multifunction synthesizers, etc. * Healthcare, for customized hearing aids and prosthetics, improved medicine delivery methods, respiratory devices, therapeutics, and flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy devices for improved procedures and recovery times * Manufacturing, for faster product development cycles, mold production, prototypes, and design trouble-shooting For industries such as aerospace and automotive, 3D Systems' technologies have reduced the time needed to incorporate design drafts and enabled the production of more efficient parts of lighter weight. Because 3D printing builds layer-by-layer according to design, it does not need to accommodate the traditional manufacturing tools of subtractive methods, often resulting in lighter parts and more efficient geometries.  Facilities and employees  In 2007, the company consolidated its offices, operations, and research and development functions into a new global headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina, US. About half of the headquarters’ consist of research and development laboratories with an Rapid Manufacturing Center (RMC) with 3D Systems’ rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and 3D printing systems at work. With customers in 80 countries, 3D Systems has over 2100 employees in 25 worldwide locations, including San Francisco, Leuven, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan . The company has more than 359 U.S. and foreign patents. In 2019, the company consolidated resources within its On Demand domestic rapid printing service locations into Littleton Colorado, Seattle Washington, Lawrenceburg Tennessee, and Wilsonville Oregon. Restructuring and additions were made to the Lawrenceburg location for future expansions and growth which nearly doubled the facility size.  Community involvement and partnerships  3D Systems is involved in a multi-year agreement with the Smithsonian Institution as part of a Smithsonian-wide effort to strengthen collections' stewardship and increase collection accessibility through 3D representations. This partnership is part of the company's attempt to broadcast the capabilities and applications of 3D printing while increasing \\"the visibility and accessibility of our national treasures.\\" In 2012, 3D Systems began partnering with the 90-year-old Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the Future New category. For this branch of the Scholastic Awards, students will be challenged to express bold and innovative ideas using new technologies. 3D Systems will offer students free 3D design software to facilitate their creations and will award three winners with a $1000 scholarship. This money is in addition to the prizes and recognition granted winners by the Scholastic Awards. 3D Systems is a corporate underwriter of the National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's ToothFairy (NCOHF). NCOHF provides community programs to deliver educational, preventative and treatment oral health services to children in at-risk populations. 3D Systems contributes its 3D content-to-print solutions and Cubify capabilities to the NCOHF effort. 3D Systems has contributed two production-grade 3D printers to the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, Ohio, the first center of a federal initiative to enhance the competitiveness of US industry. The Youngstown institute is just one regional hub of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aspires to build \\"world-class centers for applied research, technology incubation and commercialization\\" to re-localize manufacturing and strengthen US competitiveness. On February 18 of 2014, Ekso Bionics debuted the first ever 3D printed hybrid exoskeleton robotic suit, in collaboration with 3D Systems.

Apparently adopted by Renaud de Courtenay before his death in 1190 and before the split of the family into French and English branches, as the arms are used both in France and England. These are therefore very early arms as heraldry came into widespread use from about 1200–1215 House of Courtenay was a medieval noble house, with branches in France, England and the Holy Land. Origin The house was founded by Athon, the first lord of Courtenay in France. Athon took advantage of the succession crisis in the Duchy of Burgundy between Otto- William, Duke of Burgundy and Robert II of France to capture a piece of land for himself, where he established his own seigneury (lordship), taking his surname from the town he founded and fortified. Athon was succeeded by his son Joscelin, who had three sons: Miles, who was Lord of Courtenay after him; Joscelin, who joined the First Crusade and became Count of Edessa; and Geoffrey, who also fought in the Holy land and died there.Cleaveland 18.pt I In the 12th century, Reginald de Courtenay (d.1190), son of Milo de Courtenay (d.1127), quarrelled with King Louis VII of France and moved to England: His French lands were forfeit, and passed, with his sister Elizabeth, to Louis’ brother Peter, who took the name \\"Peter de Courtenay\\". The Crusader house of Courtenay Joscelin de Courtenay arrived in Outremer with the third wave of the First Crusade and proved himself capable, becoming in turn Lord of Turbessel, Prince of Galilee,Cleaveland 9.pt I and (in 1118) Count of Edessa.Cleaveland 10.pt I He was succeeded in 1131 by his son, Joscelin II, but the county was lost in 1144, and Jos died in captivity in 1159. His son, Joscelin III, was the titular Count, while his sister, Agnes, became Queen of Jerusalem by marriage to King Amalric and was mother to two monarchs, Baldwin IV and Sibylla. Joscelin III died in the 1190’s, succeeded by two daughters; his last property was passed by them to the Teutonic Order. The English House of Courtenay Reginald de Courtenay's grandson, Robert de Courtenay (d.1242), feudal baron of Okehampton, Devon, in right of his mother Hawise de Curcy (d.1219),Sanders, pp.69-70, (Okehampton) married Mary de Redvers, daughter and heiress of William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon (d.1217). Robert's great-grandson, Hugh de Courtenay, 9th Earl of Devon, (d.1340) inherited the Earldom of Devon in 1335 on the extinction of the male line of the de Redvers family. The title was subsequently recreated for Hugh de Courtenay, nephew of Hugh the elder Despenser. The family is one of the most ancient in England, currently headed by Charles Courtenay, 19th Earl of Devon. The Capetian House of Courtenay Reginald de Courtenay's daughter, Elizabeth, was given in marriage, together with his forfeited French lands, by the French Capetian King Louis VII with whom he had quarreled, to his youngest brother Peter of France (d.1183), henceforth known as Peter I of Courtenay. Peter and Elizabeth's descendants were members of the Capetian House of Courtenay, a cadet branch of the House of Capet, the French Royal House. Their descendants acquired through marriage the County of Namur and the Latin Empire of Constantinople. This branch became extinct in the male line in 1733, with the name Courtenay passing on to the Bauffremont family. See also the Houses of Montlhéry and Le Puiset. Claim to French royal status The House of Bourbon, which acquired the French throne with the accession of Henry IV of France in 1589, was another cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. Under the Salic law, males descended in male line from Hugh Capet are princes of the blood – i.e., they have the right to succeed to the French throne in the event that the male line of the royal family and of more senior princes die out. Hence, the then impoverished Capetian House of Courtenay, being agnatic descendants of Louis VI of France, sought to be acknowledged as \\"princes du sang\\" (Princes of the Blood Royal) and \\"cousins to the king,\\" two titles normally reserved for the members of the royal family and prized for the seats at the Royal Council and the Parliament of Paris that they conferred upon its holders. Moreover, the Bourbons had difficulty producing surviving male dynasts in quantity until the mid-17th century. The Capetian Courtenays were, after the Bourbons, the most senior surviving agnatic branch of the House of Capet, and under strict application of Salic law the Crown would pass to them should the Bourbons fall extinct. Three Bourbon kings in a row – Henri IV, Louis XIII, and Louis XIV – turned down their petitions. That the Bourbon monarchs confined the French royalty to the descendants of Louis IX is evidenced by the Treaty of Montmartre (1662) which named the non-Capetian House of Lorraine as the next in line to the French throne after the Bourbons, thus bypassing the Courtenay branch, a Capetian family. Although the Courtenays protested against this clause, their claims to the princely title were never acknowledged by the Paris Court of Accounts. The last male member of the French Courtenays died in 1733, but his niece married the Marquis de Bauffremont, and her descendants assumed the title of \\"Prince de Courtenay\\" with dubious validity, which they bear to this day. However the marquis de Beauffremont was made on 8 June 1757 Prince of the Holy Roman Empire (inheritable by all male-line descendants); this title was recognised in France. Beauffremont-Courtenay are also princes of Carency and dukes of Beauffremont. Genealogy *Athon **Joscelin I of Courtenay, married 1. Hildegarde de Gâtinais (sister of Geoffrey III of Anjou), 2.

He was commended posthumously \\"for distinguished devotion to duty and extraordinary courage and disregard for his own safety[,]\\" and was the most junior sailor mentioned specifically for distinguished conduct in the after action report of USS Nevada regarding the attack on Pearl Harbor. Neuendorf was laid down at the Charleston Navy Yard on 15 February 1943. The ship was launched on 1 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Edna Rose Morton, the sister of W. F. Neuendorf, Jr., SN1. The destroyer escort was commissioned on 18 October 1943, Lieutenant Commander Jasper N. McDonald in command. Service history Following shakedown off Bermuda and availability at the Charleston Navy Yard, Neuendorf, a unit of CortDiv 37, proceeded to New Orleans where she joined troop transports en route to Panama. Transiting the Canal, the destroyer escort headed west, arriving at Nouméa on 28 January 1944. Through March she escorted supply and transport vessels in the Solomons and the New Hebrides and guarded fleet oilers as they rendezvoused with ships operating against Truk and the Palaus. Next assigned to the 7th Fleet, she reported for duty at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 7 April. From there, she completed an escort run to Lae and then shepherded resupply echelons to the newly seized beaches at Hollandia, Aitape, and Tanahmerah Bay. By 18 May, she stood off Wakde Island with an LST echelon which unloaded quickly and sailed for Hollandia the same day. Escort assignments to Aitape, Hollandia and Wakde followed until June when Saidor, Manus and Biak were added to her destinations. Between 25 June and 7 July, she conducted ASW patrol off the latter, then off Aitape and at the end of the month resumed escort work. In mid-August, she returned to Purvis Bay to resume escort work in the Solomons until 13 October when she sailed for Manus and another tour with the 7th Fleet. After escorting an ammunition supply group to Kossol Roads and an oiler group to Hollandia, she bombarded enemy shore installations in the Maffin Bay area and then departed Wakde to guard an LST echelon to Leyte, arriving on 15 November. Getting under way for Hollandia again the same day, she underwent intensive training in preparation for the upcoming Luzon offensive. On 2 January 1945, she headed for the Philippines with a small oiler group. Rendezvousing with the Lingayen Minesweeping Group, the force headed through Surigao Strait and into Leyte Gulf. Enemy aircraft plagued the force as it steamed north toward Mindoro where the oilers anchored in Mangarin Bay under the protective watch of Neuendorf and sister ship . Between 5 January and 21 February, Neuendorf conducted ASW and HUK patrols, served radar picket duty, and escorted the tankers on refueling missions. On the 22nd, the destroyer escort returned to Leyte for tender availability, after which she resumed escort work between New Guinea and the Philippines. On 15 April, she was designated flagship for Commander, Local Naval Defense Forces, Iloilo, Panay. There for the next four months, she returned to Leyte after the cessation of hostilities, made an escort run to Okinawa and on 1 October departed the Philippines and headed home. Arriving at San Diego on 23 October, Neuendorf underwent inactivation overhaul and on 14 May 1946 decommissioned and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She remained a unit of that fleet until authorized for use as a target and struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1967. Awards Neuendorf earned three battle stars during World War II.

Using a hammerless, striker- fired design, these pistols are manufactured by Forjas Taurus S/A (Taurus Forge) in Porto Alegre Brazil and distributed in the United States by their subsidiary Taurus USA. The 24/7 product line was designed for the civilian concealed carry firearms market, and as backup weapons for law enforcement officers.Quinn, Jeff. \\"Taurus Model 24/7 in .40 Cal” , Taurus USA Web site – news reviews section, article from Gunblast magazine. Accessed July 3, 2008. In 2016, the PT24/7 was included in the settlement of a lawsuit which alleged that it, and certain other Taurus handguns, could fire accidentally if dropped and that Taurus covered up the safety defects. Without admitting guilt, the company paid $39 million, extended the warranties, and recalled the pistols for repair. As of April 2017, the manufacturer's website says that it is no longer being made.http://www.taurususa.com/archive_firearms.cfm Design features The 24/7 pistol features an injection molded polymer frame with blued carbon steel, stainless steel, or titanium slides. Available cartridge chamberings include 9×19mm Parabellum, .40 Smith & Wesson, and .45 ACP. Magazine capacities vary between 6, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17 rounds depending on model and caliber.\\"Gunselector results\\" , Taurus USA Web site - products section. Accessed July 3, 2008. The PT 24/7 pistols share several safety innovations with other Taurus product lines, including a positive firing pin block as well as the 'Taurus Safety Latch', a transfer bar safety which prevents firing of the pistol unless the trigger is pulled. Together these safeties assure that the pistol will not fire if it is accidentally dropped; selected models have been certified as satisfying the California drop safety requirement. In 2016, the pistols were recalled due to a failure of this safety feature. All 24/7 models also include a frame-mounted manual safety lever, and are equipped with an integrated firearm locking safety system, which Taurus calls the ‘Taurus Security System' (TSS).\\"24/7 Pistol in .45 ACP CAP 12+1 Rds\\", Taurus USA Web site – products section. Accessed July 3, 2008. 24/7 pistols are also equipped with a visible/tactile loaded chamber indicator and a dust cover Picatinny accessory rail integration system, allowing for the attachment of accessories such as laser sights or tactical lights. Sights on 24/7 pistols vary by model, basic models are equipped with fixed open iron sights with a single high contrast/visibility dot on the front sight. Three- dot sights and Heinie ‘Straight Eight’ combat sights are available for the Pro and OSS models, as well as Tritium night sights. Handling characteristics of 24/7 pistols are enhanced by features such as an ambidextrous decocking lever and ergonometric design which Taurus calls 'Memory pads', consisting of various grooves which promote proper consistent hand placement for superior handling control.\\"New Product Images\\", Taurus USA Web site - images section. Accessed July 21, 2008. In addition, a secure grasp of the pistol grip is afforded by a high adhesion gripping surface. An option on selected basic 24/7 pistols and standard on Pro models is a soft, ribbed, non-slip, hand- conforming grip which Taurus dubbed the ‘Ribber’. Trigger actions The earlier standard versions of the 24/7 pistol came equipped with single-action- only triggers (after a long \\"take-up\\"), as once the slide is \\"racked,\\" the firing pin/striker is made ready for firing and there is no mechanism to release it aside from pulling the trigger. This system differs from most dual- action triggers in that the initial pull is single-action with the double- action coming into play only on a misfire. Most dual-action triggers are double-action on the initial shot, with subsequent shots being single-action. This system allows for two major advantages; one being that the initial trigger pull is light and crisp, therefore more controllable, and the second being that if a round misfires, the trigger can be quickly pulled again in double-action mode, repeating the attempt to fire the recalcitrant round. This type of SA/DA system, pioneered on Taurus pistols, is much faster and simpler than the standard tap, rack, bang method of clearing a dud cartridge. The later Pro \\"DS\\" models and some of the \\"OSS\\" pistols sport a de-cocking lever to safely release the striker, even on a live round, thus requiring a double- action pull for the first shot. This feature gives the shooter the option of utilizing the pistol in a more traditional DA/SA manner, which will, of course, still default to double-action should a cartridge fail to fire., Taurus USA Web site – 24/7 pro accessed sept. 12 2010 OSS series The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) issued requirements in 2005 for a new .45 ACP service pistol and requested interested firearms manufacturers to submit models for field trial testing. With a large U.S. government defense contract for as many as 650,000 pistols and related accessories in the balance, Taurus was one of many companies to respond, submitting an upgraded 24/7 design they dubbed the ‘OSS’ model. When the USSOCOM request was at first delayed, and eventually indefinitely shelved, Taurus decided to offer its submission to the civilian marketplaceMetcalf, Dick.\\"The Taurus Trials\\" Guns and Ammo magazine, June 2007. Accessed July 21, 2008. where it garnered much attention and popularity, eventually winning the National Rifle Association (NRA) Handgun of the Year award in 2005.\\"Awards\\" , Taurus USA Web site – company section. Accessed July 3, 2008. The OSS models feature a 5.25 inch match grade forged barrel and a 3 position safety system - the bottom position enables the pistol to fire, the middle setting puts it in 'safe' condition, and the upper decocks the striker. This arrangement results in several carry options for the user as the gun can be carried with a round in the chamber ‘cocked and locked’ in ‘Condition one’ (striker cocked with safety on), or the arguably safer ‘Condition Two’ (striker decocked and safety off, requiring a revolver-like DA pull to both cock and fire the pistol), or even with the striker decocked and the safety on. The OSS retains the loaded chamber indicator of the other 24/7 models, and additionally allows visual verification that the pistol is ready to fire as the striker can be seen when the pistol is cocked.Clapp, Wylie. ”Made for Americas Best, Taurus OSS .45 ACP”, page 72-77.

Loosely based on the 1962 Cinerama film of the same name, it aired as a mini-series in 1977, and as a regular series in 1978 and 1979. A 2-hour pilot film, The Macahans, ran in 1976. A total of 25 episodes were aired. The show was a great success in Europe, apparently finding a larger and more lasting audience there than in the United States. It has been rebroadcast many times on various European networks, e.g. in France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden, and has built a cult following. It was released on DVD in Europe in November 2009. A sequence of paintings by Charles Marion Russell was shown during the end credits. Plot James Arness as Zeb Macahan Zebulon Macahan is a well known mountain man, trapper/trader, and scout working for the U.S. Army in the Indian Territories. In the early 1860s, as the Civil War is beginning, he is reminded that he has family back in Manassas, Virginia that he has not seen in far too long. He journeys back there. When the war comes too close to home, Zeb's sister in law, Kate convinces her husband Tim, Zeb's brother, to pack up their family, including two sons (Luke and Josh (named Seth and Jed in the pilot episode)) and two daughters (Jessie and Laura) and make the move out west. Eva Marie Saint and James Arness as Kate and Zeb Macahan Once out west the family learns from an Army unit heading east that the first battle of the war is likely to occur at Bull Run, right near Zeb and Tim's parents' home. Tim argues that he, not Zeb, should go east to fetch their parents because Zeb knows the west and can care for his family while he is gone. Tim leaves to return to Virginia, while the family winters in the Indian Territories. After that Zeb builds a sod house for the family. Then Zeb is told by a fellow frontiersman that an Army Scout named Billy Joe, who was a close friend of Zeb's has been murdered by a renegade mountainman, named Dutton, who has escaped from an Army Guardhouse that Zeb originally helped put him in for murdering innocent Indians. Zeb knows that Dutton swore vengeance on Zeb. Fearing for the safety of his family Zeb leaves the family in order to intercept Dutton before he can reach the Macahan homestead. He intends to be gone for only a short time. When he and Tim are gone too long, Luke goes back east as well to look for his father and grandparents. Luke returns home to find his grandparents were killed by artillery fire that struck their home during the First Battle of Bull Run. Luke learns from a family friend that his father was involuntarily conscripted into the Union Army. He also learns that the Union Army unit that took his father was headed towards Tennessee. Luke arrives in Tennessee just as the Battle of Shiloh starts. During the battle, Luke is unwillingly conscripted into the Union Army by a desperate officer whose unit has taken heavy losses during the Battle. Luke is wounded during the battle and is taken to a field aid station on the battle field. He finds his father, who has been mortally wounded, at the aid station. After the brutal battle where all of Luke's platoon is killed Luke decides to head west to find his family. While traveling west through Missouri he finds an abandoned horse. He rides the horse until nightfall and then takes shelter in a barn. A local sheriff with two men find Luke sleeping in the barn. They accuse him of being a horse thief. These men are southern sympathizers and because Luke is wearing Union army trousers they decide to try to lynch him. While escaping from the attempted lynching Luke grabs a pistol and he wounds the sheriff in the arm. Meanwhile, Zeb tracks down Dutton in the wilderness and kills him in a gun battle. Luke and Zeb return to their family which has been temporarily homesteading near the Platte River in Western Nebraska. Things are quiet for a time. But then a bounty hunter named Captain Grey arrives. Grey holds a commission as an Army Provost Marshal which empowers him to pursue, arrest and often kill Union soldiers accused of desertion. He arrives at the Macahan homestead to arrest Luke. Zeb threatens to kill Grey unless he leaves immediately. Kate objects to violence on principle and ask Zeb to lower his rifle. Grey draws his pistol to try to arrest Luke. Zeb slashes Grey's arm with his Bowie knife. Luke restrains Zeb and begs him to stop. Kate orders Grey to leave. Grey mounts his horse but swears to return. Luke leaves to avoid Grey. Grey pursues Luke for months. Meanwhile, the U.S. Government grants a general amnesty to all alleged deserters from the Army who left during the Civil War. But Grey resigns his Army commission and continues to track Luke because of a reward issued against Luke in Missouri over the incident where Luke wounded that southern sheriff. Grey breaks into the Macahan house to ambush Luke. Kate shoots him dead to protect her son. The first season ends with the family leaving the homestead to travel west to Oregon as they had originally intended. The second season starts with the matriarch of the family, Kate, dying in a barn fire. After that Kate's sister Molly Culhane, who is a wealthy widow, arrives from Chicago. She has journeyed west to reunite with her only remaining family. Then the former southern sheriff, named Martin Stillman, is seeking vengeance and pursues Luke. This former sheriff is now a wealthy businessman. The arm where Luke wounded him is partially crippled. He is obsessed with avenging himself upon Luke. He hires gunmen who torture and nearly kill Luke's brother Josh while pursuing Luke. Eventually Stillman is killed by Zeb in a gunfight. During his travels Luke gains a reputation as skilled gunfighter. Luke is forced to spend most of the rest of the series fleeing pursuit (not being cleared of the charges even at the series finale). The remainder of the series involves the rest of the family and their lives as they settle in and build up their farm and horse ranch, which is located in the Tetons region of Wyoming, with Zeb as their patriarch.

Beginning in the late 19th century, Judson Powder Works manufactured dynamite at the northwest foot of the hill. The company had been forced to move from San Francisco and then nearby Fleming Point in Berkeley because of continuing accidental explosions. The eucalyptus trees now on the hill were planted by the dynamite manufacturers to catch debris and muffle sound of these explosions. The stop on the transcontinental railroad tracks just to the west was called Nobel Station, after the inventor of dynamite. In 1905, a massive accidental explosion of nitroglycerin killed 23 workers. The explosion carved a massive crater in the north flank of the hill, which is today evident by a large dip in the tree-line. After this incident, dynamite making was forced north to less-settled areas, making an eventual last stand at Pt. Pinole, now a regional park. Quarrying on the hill continued for many years, leaving scars on the rock and eventually obliterating a low summit northwest of Albany Hill, approximately where Richmond's Pacific East Mall is now located. Modern history and ecology As a large open space, the only nearby high elevation next to the Bay, and in the path of sea winds blowing through the Golden Gate, Albany Hill is an ecological island. It is a haven for plants normally found in much cooler areas, for example Nootka rose (Rosa nutkana), stinging phacelia (Phacelia malvifolia), and coast horkelia (Horkelia californica ssp. californica) The Native American practice of regular burning to avoid brush buildup (and major fires) was continued by the dynamite companies and later the city, into the 1960s. Perhaps as a result, the hill harbors unusually large numbers of native wildflowers and other plants. The oak forest on the cool north face remains much as it was pre-European-settlement. The non-native eucalyptus trees on the summit attract migrating and wintering monarch butterflies. Hawks, owls, wild turkeys, and deer are among the animal inhabitants; herons, kingfishers, and egrets fish the creek. The hill provides a view of Albany, Berkeley — notably, UC Berkeley's Sather Tower — and the Berkeley Hills from one side. From the other, it looks out onto the Bay, with San Francisco in the distance. Looking south from the hill, the high-rises in downtown Oakland and Emeryville are visible. From earliest European settlement, residents have enjoyed open space on the hill, \\"sledding\\" on dry grass and swinging from rope swings. From the early 20th century on, particularly in the 1970s, numerous schemes were proposed for development of Albany Hill, from dynamiting it for bay fill to building high-rise hotels or blasting out the top as a reservoir. Protest by local residents defeated most of these. Eventually the city retained an environmental consultant to prepare an Environmental Impact Report on alternative development schemes and development densities. After a series of public hearings the consultant's recommendation design was chosen leading to the present development pattern of clustered high-rise residential use and preservation of the majority of the hill. In 1994, citizens passed Measure K, cutting allowed density on the hill by half and allowing the city to pursue further lowering, and in 1996 voters passed Measure R, a special levy including $3 million to buy land on the hill. In 2008, the remaining open space hill was declared a Priority Conservation Area by Bay Area and state agencies. By 2019, when the bonds matured, the city had bought small parcels totaling six acres. The remaining bond funds in 2019 were being spent for access and other improvements called for in the city's plans for the park, adopted first in 1991 and repeated in a new plan adopted in 2012. Just under of almost 40 acres of open space on the hill is protected from development. A public park extends from Cerrito Creek up the north side of the hill. Large condominiums on the west side of the hill maintain significant areas of open space as part of their development agreements, and the north part of the summit ridge and a portion of the northeast slope is owned by the city. The remaining quarter of the open space is a single tract: South of the highest point, a 10.7-acre privately owned parcel runs from Pierce Street on the west up over the summit and down to Taft Street on the east slope. Most users treat this land as park, but the city has never negotiated a legal right-of-way allowing public access. In late 2019, this tract was listed for sale at $10 million. It is zoned for apartments or town homes, with a maximum density of nine units per acre. The city's Master Plan includes various policies regarding this parcel, including keeping the summit open, clustering development, providing a trail easement, protecting monarch butterfly habitat, minimizing grading, and protecting and restoring the hill's natural features, native vegetation, and wildlife. Fire is a serious concern on this wooded hill surrounded by city. Plans adopted in 1991 and 2012 call for thinning eucalyptus and controlling brush to create a savannah-like habitat that would limit fires. On November 15, 2008, strong dry northeast winds whipped up a fire in a forested area on the west side of the hill above a large apartment complex (555 Pierce Street). Recent heavy rains and a prompt response by the Albany and Berkeley fire departments limited the blaze to , with no structures burned. However, the fire danger may be less than what it seems. In the 1980s, a large fire started from Pierce street, and swept uphill, going north-west. No large tree burned, although many were scorched. The fire burned fiercely the Poison Oak, next to the ground (this was witnessed by local residents such as Constance Ramos and Patrice Ayme). Large eucalyptuses are naturally resistant to fire. The fire apparently provoked the germination of rare native conifers (species of endangered junipers, pines and cypresses). However some of these young rare trees have been deliberately destroyed in recent years (Margot C. proudly said so to Patrice Ayme on Saturday, February 15, 2020, around 10 am) . The city has increased brush control, road maintenance, and clearing. Clearing is limited by wanting to maintain habitat for birds, including hawks and owls, and monarch butterflies that use the eucalyptus trees as a migration stopover or winter habitat. A few volunteer groups work on and near the hill. Friends of Albany Hill has worked to maintain and increase native vegetation on the hill itself by removing non-native invasive plants (but the interpretation of what is invasive is disputed, as revealed in the conversation between Margot C., who boasted that she destroyed conifers she views as non-native, and Patrice Ayme, which views Monterey Pines and Cypresses, and endemic Junipers as natives). They have also educated the public about the natural and cultural significance of the hill, and in the 1990s they helped bring privately held parcels into city hands. Friends of Five Creeks has done extensive restoration along Cerrito and Middle Creeks and adjoining groves and meadows at the foot of the hill. A new group,TASH (Tending the Ancient Shoreline Hill), formed in 2018 to continue habitat restoration and environmental education on Albany Hill, holds monthly work parties. Lions Club cross A 20-foot cross stands near the summit of Albany Hill. The cross was erected by the Albany Lions Club in 1971 on then- private land, subject to an easement allowing for maintenance by the Lions Club. The land was obtained by the City of Albany in 1973. The cross is illuminated by the Lions Club on Christmas, Easter, and other occasions such as the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The cross has been subject to disputes regarding the Lions Club easement and the legality of a Christian symbol displayed on public land. In 2016, the city cut off power to the cross for several months, citing safety concerns regarding the electrical wiring. In June 2018, a federal judge ruled the display unconstitutional, requiring that the city remove the cross or sell the parcel on which it stands. Excavation Of Albany Hill Proposed To Make Multi-Million Dollars Three Stories Mansions In January 2020, consecutive to extensive secret talks, a development of 48 mansions up the west side of Albany Hill, facing the Golden Gate, was proposed by Trumark Homes.https://www.albanyca.org/home/showdocument?id=43511 At present market prices the homes would be worth up to four million dollars each. The project would involve extensive excavations, due to the slope of the hill. A special session of the Albany Zoning Commission was held, with a huge attendance (standing room and spilling in the hallway)... Mostly stridently opposed to this 1% project, which would violate public easements which are more than a century old, and destroy more than 500 large trees. A public petition (\\"Save Albany Hill Park\\") was created online to entice City Hall to block the project.

It was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Opened in the 1920s, it served hotel guests in luxury accommodations. Later, it was as a residence hall of the University of Chicago for many years, before being converted to an apartment building in 2013. History The Shoreland Hotel was opened in 1926 by Harry Fawcett, who reportedly spent $2 million on furnishings alone. The Shoreland Hotel maintained 1,000 guest rooms over 13 floors, a crystal ballroom, a large banquet hall with a top-notch restaurant and an immaculate lobby with 30-foot- high ceilings. Its terra-cotta exterior featured gargoyles and other elaborate stonework. It hosted countless wedding receptions and parties for Chicago's elite, including a massive banquet held when Amelia Earhart returned triumphantly in 1928 to the Hyde Park neighborhood where she had attended high school. Later, Al Capone was known to conduct \\"business\\" in certain rooms. In the 1950s, Jimmy Hoffa kept a room in the hotel and often held raucous union meetings there. As the story goes, one of Hoffa's underlings choked the hotel manager, Maurice Bellows in the lobby after he dared to ask the union boss to pay his debt to the hotel. Marge Bellows was the Shoreland's owner at the time, making the hotel the largest in the country with a woman in charge. Another notable resident was Milton Friedman, who occupied rooms in the Shoreland at the same time as Hoffa. Elvis Presley also spent several nights at the Shoreland. Over time the hotel began to lose its splendor, and in the 1970s it was sold for $750,000 to the University of Chicago. It then became a dormitory, known as Shoreland Hall, and housed approximately 650 undergraduate students. However, in the spring of 2004 the university decommissioned the Shoreland as a dormitory, citing increasing maintenance costs and decreasing popularity among incoming students. It remained in use by the university through spring quarter of 2009, after which it was turned over to a Chicago developer that specializes in historical preservation. The University sold the Shoreland for $6 million to Kenard Corporation, who had planned to turn it into 260 condominiums. Hal Lichterman, the president of the corporation, had said he hoped to put a restaurant in the old banquet hall and would otherwise gut the building. In fall 2006, after Hal Lichterman's death, Kenard resold the Shoreland for $10 million to R.D. Horner & Associates, one of the three initial bidders on the property. Horner & Associates planned to carry out Kenard's exact plans for converting the dormitory into condominiums. They had originally intended to open the building as early as late 2009, but in April 2007 the University exercised its option to keep the Shoreland open as a dormitory for the 2008-09 academic year. The Shoreland was sold yet again to New Jersey-based Antheus Capital (through its 5454 S. Shore Drive LLC holding) in August 2008http://www.hydepark.org/historicpres/shoreland.htm for $16 million. Antheus Capital and MAC Property Management decided to develop its own plans for the Shoreland. Antheus took over the lease with the University of Chicago, expiring in 2009. It was converted to apartments and reopened in 2013 with a total of 330 units.http://www.chicagomag.com/real- estate/March-2014/Inside-The-Shoreland-Apartment-Hotel/ See also * Housing at the University of Chicago References External links *Shoreland Chicago official website *Aerial image of the Shoreland under construction Category:Defunct hotels in Illinois Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1926 Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Category:Apartment buildings in Chicago Category:Chicago Landmarks ","title":"Shoreland Hotel"},{"id":"4234095","text":"Errol \\"Budoy\\" Marabiles (born October 22, 1971 in Samar, Philippines) is a Filipino reggae musician, songwriter and TV host. He was one of the fourteen housemates in the ABS-CBN show Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition. Marabiles, easily recognizable among the housemates because of his dreadlocks or turban, attended the University of the Philippines Cebu. Billed by the show as the \\"M16 of Samar\\", he is best known as the vocalist of the Cebu-based reggae band Junior Kilat, which is responsible for songs such as Original Sigbin (In Bisaya mythology, Sigbin is a mythical creature), K Fyne (Okay, Fine) and Ako si M16 (I am M16), which secured the Best Song in the 2005 NU Rock awards sponsored by the Manila-based rock radio station NU 107. That song bested most rock compositions of Manila-based bands though its lyrics are in Cebuano. Together with one of his bandmates, Marabiles also co-produced and hosted the magazine show Ismol Tym (Small Time) on the independent Cebu-based cable channel RCTV prior to entering PBB. Marabiles was evicted from the PBB house on Day 49 after losing to fellow nominees Zanjoe Marudo and Bianca Gonzalez through the people's vote. During his stay in the house, he composed (and performed) some songs that are in the Pinoy Big Brother Celebrity Edition soundtrack: Budoy Ako, a Visayan adaptation of Pinoy Ako, and Maligo Na Jam, based on his \\"Maligo na\\" (Take a bath already) rap, together with fellow housemates Rico Robles and Roxanne Barcelo. After being evicted from the House, there was a published report that he told reporters the correct spelling of his last name is \\"Mirabiles\\", not \\"Marabiles\\" as earlier listed in the official show website and related collateral.

'Sayed' is an honorific title that indicates lineage with the family of the Banu Hashem. Also known simply as Rahmatullah, he was once enrolled as a non-degree student at Yale University. In July 2006, it was announced that his application to pursue a bachelor's degree had been rejected by Yale College via the Eli Whitney Students Program.  Biography  Rahmatullah was born in Afghanistan, to Pashtun parents. In mid 1980s, his family moved to Pakistan. Rahmatullah grew up in Pakistan and was educated in the Pakistani school system. His schooling was fragmented, but he did emerge proficient in English as well as Pashto, Persian, and Urdu. In 1994, Rahmatullah worked as a computer operator and translator at the zonal sub- office of Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kandahar. He was appointed to the position of diplomat in the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan in 1998. In this capacity, he traveled around the world as an envoy of the Afghan Foreign Ministry of the Taliban regime. When top Taliban leaders were banned from foreign travel, Rahmatullah acted as representative of the regime on foreign visits.  Yale attendance controversy  In 2004, an American friend, Mike Hoover--a CBS cameraman who had sponsored his 2001 trip --suggested applying to college in the US. In 2005, Rahmatullah was admitted to Yale as a non degree student. In 2006, conservative sentiment arose opposing Rahmatullah studying at Yale University and questioning outright his presence in the United States. As of April 2006, Yale has published the following comment on its website: : Yale has allowed Mr. Hashemi to take courses for college credit in a part-time program that does not award Yale degrees... We hope that his courses help him understand the broader context for the conflicts around the world... According to the State Department, Ramatullah Hashemi was issued U.S. visas in 2004 and 2005, first on a tourist visa and then in 2005 on a student visa. The mandatory procedures were followed, which, in his case, included vetting through an interagency security clearance process. He was cleared by all agencies.\\"University statement on Mr. Hashmi's enrollment as a part-time, non-degree student, Yale University Office of Public Affairs, 29 March 2006 A recent non-scientific poll conducted by the Yale Herald—a student-run weekly newspaper—which was answered by 2,000 undergrads, concluded that 50% of Yale supported Hashmi's acceptance and about 25% opposed it.

Premiering in 2005 and distributed over the Internet, the show is created using the machinima technique of recording the video and audio from a multiplayer Xbox Live session of Bungie' first-person shooter video game Halo 2. The half-hour episodes are released in six smaller parts, called modules. Guests, such as Bungie's audio director Martin O'Donnell are interviewed via Xbox Live within the online multiplayer worlds of Halo 2, and most recently Halo 3. In addition to regular shows, special content has been created for Spiketv.com and the 2006 Machinima Festival. A premium edition of Halo 3 includes exclusive This Spartan Life content. Most recently, This Spartan Life has been distributed on Xbox Live's central hub for Halo, Halo Waypoint. The new episodes on Halo Waypoint include interviews with members of the band OK Go and an interview with Ultima Online creator Richard Garriott. Episode format This Spartan Life consists of episodes separated into five or six modules of varying lengths. These modules are the core of the show; they vary from episode to episode. However, there are some common threads. Every show starts with a talk-show standard, the monologue, during which Damian lays out the show ahead, as well as a small comedy bit. This is the only \\"stable\\" segment of the show, besides the Solid Gold Elite Dancers, as it has appeared in every episode. The Solid Gold Elite Dancers segment is a dance segment (usually), set to music by Glomag, the pseudonym of the creator Chris Burke, and in Episode Three was a full-fledged music video. The segment \\"Body Count\\", which appeared in the first two episodes, is a debate between two contestants who make their points while fighting each other. The Travelogue segment is a glitch montage, which is set to music, and is one of the most popular segments, as the show's original fans were glitchers. The rest of the segment are usually the interviews, with the guest of the show. Characters Damian (left) and Octobit. This Spartan Life has a full cast of characters, each with their own unique qualities, which serve to move the show along. As is typical in machinima, the characters have very strong personalities and are heavily characterized in order to make up for the weakness of machinima: the inability to act. The host, Damian Lacedaemion, is a personable soldier in grey with a smiley face emblem adorning his armor. He leads the show with his carefree manner, and when his guests come under fire, he often has to fall back on his soldiering skills to save them. He tries to rise to a \\"higher level of discourse\\"Episode 3, Module 2. and is the center of the civil nature of the show. Damian has a shotgun, named Phil, which can talk, and prefers to be used exclusively by Damian and will fight anyone attempting to use him without authorization.Episode 3, Module 1. The show's DJ, DJ Octobit, is named in a reference to the 8-bit music he plays in the show. He creates the music for the show on his DJ console, which looks like a strange round pedestal. He never speaks, yet he has defended Damian on several occasions. In the first episode he is referred to as Doctor Octobit, but later his name was changed to DJ Octobit. The show featured a co-host under the tag of d4rk5had0w other-wise known as K. He played a small role in the mini-series as a stand-up comedy Spartan but later left the show. The show also features the Solid Gold Elite Dancers (a reference to the 1980s television series Solid Gold). They usually dance to music by Glomag, the alias of Chris Burke, and a segment in the show is reserved for them. The Solid Gold Elite Dancers; from left to right, Shondra, Amber, Bernardo, Tony and Sasha. The show also has a number of less frequently appearing characters. Damian's bodyguard, Fyb3roptik, had an interesting habit of shooting at Damian every time he appeared. This running gag is a fan favorite, hence its continued appearances, but has not happened recently as of Episode 5. Also included is Gunnery Sergeant Spillane, voiced by John Keith, who also writes the show. He has only appeared once, to run the bodyguard competition. Peaches and Sherry, the camera operators, occasionally comment on what is going on, but otherwise have a small role in the show. Clarence, Damian's Guardian Arbiter, appeared in Episode 4, but it was later seen that he was killed by a plasma grenade. History The idea of This Spartan Life was first conceived in late 2004, at Bong + Dern Productions when there was a drop in the amount of audio work for the company. Both Halo players, Chris Burke and John Dylan Keith began to develop the idea of a Halo- based machinima series. The creator, Chris Burke, wanted to create a sort of social environment for nonviolent interaction, but he had little success, mainly because \\"very few people were willing to stop shooting\\".Lee, Interview: This Spartan Life A Talk Show in Game Space. After discovering the true potential to hold an intelligent conversation in the game, he was inspired to create a talk show, originally to be called The Spartan 117 Dialogs, the name of which would have come from the official code for the Master Chief, protagonist of the Halo video game series. However, before episode one was released the name was changed to This Spartan Life, and all releases have been under that name. The show, while fairly popular, saw a spike in popularity with the release of its fifth blog, which centered on network neutrality. That episode became widespread and was shown to the United States Congress.This Spartan Life: News, 05.10.2006 This Spartan Life experienced a surge in media attention, as shown by This Spartan Lifes press page.This Spartan Life: Press.

Production This Spartan Life videos are released on the site, in both QuickTime and Windows Media Video formats. As is common in Halo machinima, the show is made on Xbox Live or using interconnected Xboxes, and the final footage is edited in Final Cut Pro.HappyNews. The guests are either interviewed on Xbox Live, or in Bong + Dern's sound booth. Most shows are made, at least in part, on Xbox Live; however, not all of the show segments can be filmed exclusively on Xbox Live, due to issues of in-game latency (\\"lag\\"), which would otherwise prevent the coordination seen in the Solid Gold Elite Dancers. The cameras are created using the \\"gun-drop glitch\\", which causes them to lose their weapons, thus providing a less obstructed screen.Pereira. The guests for the show are usually interviewed in Bong + Dern's sound booth.Bryant. As of the most recent release of media (Episode 5, Module 4) the cast has moved to Halo 3, utilizing the Saved Film feature for capturing. This Spartan Life straddles the real and virtual world. It is filmed in and intentionally incorporates the unpredictability of the open environment of Xbox Live. During a filming session, others engage earnestly in a multiplayer game in the same area, and may sometimes attack the host or his interviewee.

He held numerous political and military positions with the Nazi Party and the Schutzstaffel (SS) both before and after the German Anschluss of Austria in 1938. During World War II he served with the SS in France, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. In 1943 he was appointed SS and Police Leader in German-occupied Warsaw, the capital of Poland. Due to his crimes against Poles - including Polish Jews - the Polish resistance Home Army, in agreement with the Polish government in exile, targeted him for assassination. He was gunned down by the Poles in front of the SS headquarters in Warsaw in a special operation by Kedyw, a dedicated Polish special operations unit. In reprisal, the Nazis murdered 300 Polish civilians.  Life  Kutschera was born in Oberwaltersdorf, Lower Austria (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and was the son of a professional gardener and minor civil servant. After primary school he served as a cabin boy in the Austro- Hungarian Navy in 1918–19 and later attended gymnasium in Villach. After graduation Kutschera enrolled at a machinists school in Budapest before training to become a gardener like his father. Between the 1920 and 1928 Kutschera resided in Opava and Karlovy Vary in the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.  Nazi career  Heinrich Himmler (front) visiting KZ Mauthausen in April 1941, with August Eigruber (far left), Franz Ziereis (left), Karl Wolff (right) and Franz Kutschera (far right) Kutschera joined the Austrian Nazi Party in December, 1930 and the Schutzstaffel (SS) in November, 1931. The Nazi Party in Austria was banned in July 1933 by the Austrofascist government of Engelbert Dollfuss. Despite the government ban, Kutschera remained a committed Party activist and was arrested several times by Austrian authorities for illegal pro-Nazi political activities. From 1933 he served as an SS-Truppführer in Carinthia, and he joined the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in 1934. In July 1935 he was appointed deputy commander of the 90th SS-Standarte based in Klagenfurt, serving in this capacity until March 1938. Upon the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in March 1938, Kutschera left active duty with the SS, holding the rank of Obersturmbannführer. He then worked briefly for the civil administration of the newly established Reichsgau Kärnten as a deputy to Gauleiter Hubert Klausner from March until 24 May when he was officially appointed Deputy Gauleiter. He essentially ran the Gau during Klausner's absence in Vienna in his capacity as deputy to Reichskommissar Josef Bürckel.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust), R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, p. 156, . After the 10 April 1938 election and referendum, Kutschera became a member of the Großdeutscher Reichstag, maintaining this position continuously until his death. In February 1939 he was also appointed to the People's Court as a lay judge. Upon Klausner's sudden death on 12 February 1939, Kutschera officially became Acting Gauleiter of Carinthia. Warsaw SS and Police leader announcement of execution of 60 Polish hostages and sentencing to death of 40 more, November 1941 With the outbreak of World War II Kutschera was named representative of the Reich Defense Commissioner for southeastern Austria and northern Slovenia and \\"Gau manager\\" for Carinthia. Kutschera was promoted to the rank of SS-Brigadeführer in November 1940 and volunteered for military service. He was transferred to the Vosges and took part in the Battle of France. During the German Balkan Campaign, on 14 April 1941 Kutschera was named Chief of Civil Administration for Slovenian Carinthia and Upper Carniola, which were administered as part of his Gau, and where he distinguished himself in the fight against the Yugoslav Partisans with fanaticism and extreme harshness. On 27 November 1941, Kutschera was dismissed as Gauleiter for intriguing to absorb the neighboring Reichsgau Salzburg into his jurisdiction. He was succeeded by Friedrich Rainer, the Gauleiter in Salzburg. In January 1942 Kutschera was seconded to the staff of Obergruppenführer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the Higher SS and police leader (HSSPF) for Central Russia (Belarus), where he served as a representative of the Reich Commissariat for the Strengthening of German Nationhood (RKFDV). Soon after his arrival on the Eastern Front, Kutschera personally directed numerous anti-partisan and mass-killing operations in the occupied territories of the Soviet Union. In November 1942 he was given the rank of Generalmajor der Polizei and on 5 May 1943 he was appointed SS and Police Leader (SSPF) for the Mogilev district.  Discovery  On 25 September 1943, Kutschera took office as SS and Police Leader for the Warsaw district of the General Government in occupied Poland. Once in power in Warsaw he increased the number of roundups (łapanka) of Polish citizens and the number of hostage executions. Every day lists were hung in public announcing the names of the next Poles to be executed in the event of any attack on a German soldier or police officer. These notices were always signed anonymously by the \\"Commander of the SS and Police at Warsaw District\\". Kutschera's exact whereabouts while in Warsaw were a closely guarded secret within the German security services but were discovered in December 1943 by Aleksander Kunicki (Rayski), chief of intelligence for the Agat (Anti-Gestapo) unit of Kedyw. In the course of his routine surveillance of the Gestapo offices on Aleje Szucha, Rayski noticed an Opel Admiral limousine entering the driveway of the nearby Warsaw SS headquarters. The SS officer who emerged from the car wore the clearly identifiable rank and insignia of a Brigadeführer. Intrigued, Rayski began to secretly monitor the mysterious SS man's arrivals and departures from SS headquarters and filed a report with his superiors. An investigation by Kedyw in January, 1944 confirmed that the man being observed by Rayski was Franz Kutschera.  Assassination  Leszczyński Palace Ujazdowskie 23 The site of the assassination. Behind the trees is building of Ujazdów Avenue 23 housing Headquarters for Warsaw district of SS and Police where Kutschera was assassinated. Following his discovery by Rayski, Kutschera was tried in absentia by a secret Special Court of the Polish Underground State. He was charged with crimes against the Polish nation, in particular, the routine mass murder of Polish civilians in Warsaw. Kutschera was convicted and sentenced to death. In London the leadership of the Polish government-in-exile concurred with the decision of the Special Court and approved Kutschera's death sentence. The execution order was soon drafted and relayed to the commander of Kedyw, Brigadier General Emil August Fieldorf (Nil), whose organization had been given the tasks of planning and performing the assassination. The execution was carried out by the combat-sabotage unit of Kedyw (the predecessor of Battalion Parasol). The assassination team consisted of 12 individual operatives, mostly members of the scouting and guiding Gray Ranks.Mazower, Mark (2008) Hitler's Empire, pp 495 It was planned to carry out the execution in front of the Warsaw SS Headquarters at 23 Ujazdów Avenue. On the morning of 1 February 1944 three Kedyw gunmen: (Lot), who was armed with a German MP 40 submachine gun; (Kruszynka), carrying a British Sten; and (Miś), armed with a Luger pistol, ambushed Kutschera as his limousine approached SS Headquarters and opened fire directly into the car. Both Kutschera and his driver were shot multiple times and killed. An intense firefight ensued between nearby Germans troops and the other members of the assassination team in which four Poles and two Germans were killed. Kutschera's funeral ceremony was held by the Nazis at Brühl palace and his body was later transported to Berlin aboard a special train. On 2 February 1944 the German authorities in Warsaw staged a public execution of 300 Polish civilian hostages as a reprisal for the assassination. The Germans also imposed a crushing 100 million złoty tribute on the Polish residents of Warsaw and Warsaw County. Kutschera was succeeded as SS and Police leader by Paul Otto Geibel in March, 1944.

His singular effort over five decades brought to light major literary works in Tamil and contributed vastly to the enrichment of its literary heritage. Iyer published over 90 books in his lifetime, on a variety of matters connected to classical Tamil literature, and collected over 3,000 paper manuscripts, palm-leaf manuscripts and notes of various kinds.http://www.maalaimalar.com/timeline/kalasuvadugal/2018/04/28004852/1159462/UV- Swaminatha-Iyer-Memorial-Day-April-28-1942.vpf, \\"தமிழ் தாத்தா உ.வே.சாமிநாத ஐயர் நினைவு நாள் - ஏப்ரல் 28, 1942\\" (Memorial Day – April 28, 1942 – of the Grandfather of Tamil, U.V.

He was also a beneficiary of the reputed Saiva Mutt at Thiruvavaduthurai. Tyagaraja Chettiar was the head of the Tamil Department at the Government Arts College, Kumbakonam. A student of Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, he was a man of great erudition and was held in high esteem alike by his pupils and by the public. When Chettiar retired, he recommended that Swaminatha Iyer be invited to take his place. Swaminatha Iyer was duly appointed to that post on 16 February 1880. During his tenure at the College, Swaminatha Iyer met Salem Ramaswami MudaliarHudson: The Responses of Tamils to Their Study by Westerners 1608-1908 p. 192-193, a civil munsif who had been recently transferred to Kumbakonam. The friendship between them proved to be a turning point in Swaminatha Iyer's life. Mudaliar was responsible for persuading Iyer to edit and publish the ancient Tamil classics. Swaminatha Iyer had till then confined his enjoyment of Tamil literature to medieval works. Mudaliar also gave him a handwritten copy of Seevaga Sindhamani for publication. Manuscript recovery Iyer studying palm leaf manuscripts As the Civaka Cintamani was a Jain classic, Swaminatha Iyer went to the homes of learned member of the Jain community in Kumbakonam to get some doubts cleared. He also read the Jain epics and collated several manuscript versions and arrived at a correct conclusion. It was due to his efforts that the Cevaka Cintamani was published in 1887. From that time onwards, he began to search for Sangam classics with a view to editing and publishing them. After the Cevaka Cintamani, the Pattupattu was published.Telegraph India – March 2010 Thus began Swaminatha Iyer's long search for the original texts of ancient literary works during which he regularly worked with C. W. Damodaram Pillai. It was a search that lasted until his death. Many people voluntarily parted with the manuscripts in their possession. Swaminatha Iyer visited almost every hamlet and knocked at every door. He employed all the resources at his command to get at the works. As a result, a large number of literary works which were gathering dust as palm-leaf manuscripts in lofts, storerooms, boxes and cupboards saw the light of day. Of them, the Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai and Purananuru were received by Tamil lovers with a lot of enthusiasm. Purananuru, which mirrored the lives of Tamils during the Sangam period, prompted scholarly research on the subject. In a span of about five decades, Swaminatha Iyer published about 100 books, including minor poems, lyrics, puranas and bhakti (devotional) works.The Hindu-Frontline – Mar 2005 Swaminatha Iyer retired from active teaching in 1919. His research work increased several times after retirement. He travelled from place to place in search of palm leaf manuscripts so as to edit and publish them. From 1924 to 1927, Iyer was the Principal of the Meenakshi Tamil College in Annamalai University, Chidambaram. On health grounds, he resigned the post, came to Madras and continued his research. Contributions to Tamil music Swaminatha Ayyar Another significant contribution made by Swaminatha Iyer is in the realm of Tamil music. Until Swaminatha Iyer published the Cilappatikaram, Pattupattu and Ettuthokai, music was a grey area in Tamil research. During the previous four centuries, Telugu and Sanskrit dominated the music scene in Tamil Nadu in the absence of any valuable information on Tamil music. Swaminatha Iyer's publications threw light on the presence of Tamil music in the earlier centuries and paved the way for serious research on the subject. As the son of a famous musician of his time, Swaminatha Iyer learnt music from Gopalakrishna Bharathi, a musical exponent and the author of Nandan Sarithiram. His autobiography Swaminatha Iyer published his autobiography, En Saritham, serialised in the Tamil weekly Ananda Vikatan, from January 1940 to May 1942. It was later published as a book in 1950. Running into 762 pages, the book is an excellent account of the life and times of villages, especially in the Thanjavur district in the late 19th century. The Tamil is simple and peppered with many observations on people as well as descriptions of school life, life in monasteries (Maths). The book also reveals the enormous perseverance of U V Swaminatha Iyer in his quest to master Tamil and save manuscripts. Legacy and honours Statue of U. V. Swaminatha Iyer in the campus of Presidency College, Chennai It was due to his efforts that the world came to know the literary output of the ancient Tamils and their past. Tamil poet and nationalist Subramania Bharati, who inspired the freedom movement with his songs, admired Swaminatha Iyer. Paying tribute to Swaminatha Iyer in one of his poems, Bharati equated Iyer with the sage, Agastya when he called him Kumbamuni. (Agastya, who was among the first exponents of Tamil, was supposed to have been born in a Kumbha—a kind of vessel—hence the name Kumbamuni) and said: \\"So long as Tamil lives, poets will venerate you and pay obeisance to you. You will ever shine as an immortal.\\"S.

In October 2014 it was announced that Tearaway was becoming fully digital, with the Term 4, 2014 edition of the magazine being its last printed issue. Tearaway is now predominantly a magazine website, with its own YouTube channel, Tearaway TV.Tearaway Magazine - YouTube Channel. Retrieved November 6, 2014. Content ranges from music, theatre, movies, health, education, travel and politics.

Retrieved November 6, 2014. Tearaway has writers and editors based across the country, including all of the main centres, with most of its editorial team being based in Wellington. The name of the magazine was chosen because in New Zealand slang a \\"tearaway\\" is a bit of a rebel, which was thought to describe the magazine's readers. In addition, the founders intended to 'tear away’ from the style and attitude that most other publications had towards teenagers – to find new ways of presenting the stories of young people.  Editorial Team and Ownership  Tearaway is edited by Erica McQueen, a former Maverick and Music Editor, now the owner of the magazine. In 2017, Tearaway created its first ever political editorial role, taking on student Ethan Griffiths as Political Editor. In 2019, Tearaway created it's Hapori (community) Editor role, with Azaria Howell selected for the position. In late 2019, Rain Francis, daughter of the magazines founders John and Vicki Francis stepped down as publisher. Rain sold the magazine to Alexandra and Nick Cownie, owners of Whiteboard Media Ltd, a publishing group based in Australia. Shortly after the change of ownership, the Editor, Deputy Editor and Political Editor stood down. In June 2020 during the COVID-19 economic crisis, Whiteboard Media sold the magazine to Erica McQueen, a former Maverick and Music Editor. McQueen assumed the role of Editor.  Controversy  In 2003, Tearaway found itself embroiled in controversy after McDonald's in New Zealand banned the magazine from its restaurants. Liam Jeory, the Director of Corporate Relations of McDonald’s Restaurants, said ‘some restaurants’ were banning the edition because of its ‘sexuality’ content, and because there was a competition giving away condoms and lubricants. In actual fact, the article surrounded the experience of gay young people coming out to their parents, and included a giveaway for Durex condoms, which had occurred in previous editions of the magazine also. Tearaway later responded in a press release, saying \\"McDonald’s advocate being a ‘family values’ restaurant. Are gay youth not part of families?\\".

It concluded on 1 July 1985, entered into force 1 January 1992, and is as of September 2017 ratified by 14 countries. The Convention uses a harmonised definition of a trust, which is the subject of the convention, and sets Conflict rules for resolving problems in the choice of the applicable law. The key provisions of the Convention are: * each party recognises the existence and validity of trusts. However, the Convention only relates to trusts with a written trust instrument. It would not apply trusts which arise (usually in common law jurisdictions) without a written trust instrument. * the Convention sets out the characteristics of trusts under the convention (even jurisdictions with considerable legal history relating to trusts find this difficult) * the Convention sets out clear rules for determining the governing law of trusts with a cross border element. Background Many states do not have a developed law of trusts, or the principles differ significantly between states. It was therefore necessary for the Hague Convention to define a trust to indicate the range of legal transactions regulated by the Convention and, perhaps more significantly, the range of applications not regulated. The definition offered in Article 2 is: :...the legal relationship created, inter vivos or on death, by a person, the settlor, when assets have been placed under the control of a trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary or for a specified purpose. :A trust has the following characteristics: ::(a) the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee's own estate; ::(b) title to the trust assets stands in the name of the trustee or in the name of another person on behalf of the trustee; ::(c) the trustee has the power and the duty, in respect of which he is accountable, to manage, employ or dispose of the assets in accordance with the terms of the trust and the special duties imposed upon him by law. The reservation by the settlor of certain rights and powers, and the fact that the trustee may himself have rights as a beneficiary, are not necessarily inconsistent with the existence of a trust. Article 3 provides that the Convention only applies to express trusts created voluntarily and evidenced in writing. It will therefore not cover oral trusts, resulting trusts, constructive trusts, statutory trusts or trusts created by judicial order. But signatory states are free to apply the Convention to any form of trust. There are incidental question problems if the trust is testamentary and, under Article 4, if it is alleged that the testator lacked capacity, or that the will is formally or substantively invalid, or that it had been revoked, these issues must be determined first under the lex fori Conflict rules on characterisation and choice of law before the Convention rules can apply. This will include, for example, a detailed consideration of any marriage settlement or applicable law containing community property provisions which might prevent the testator alienating property from a spouse or child of the family (see succession (conflict)). Obviously, if the will purporting to create the trust is held invalid, there are no trusts to adjudicate upon. The applicable law Article 6 allows the settlor to select the applicable law in the inter vivos or testamentary document. Under normal circumstances, the settlor will be acting on professional advice and will make an express selection or it will be implied from the facts of the case. But, under Actable 6(2), if the settlor selects a law with no relevant provisions or the provisions in the municipal law selected would be inappropriate, or there is no selection, Article 7 applies to select the law which is most closely connected with the transaction. This is judged by reference to four alternative connecting factors which are to be considered as at the time the putative trust is created: # the place where the trust is to be administered; # the place where the assets are to be found (for immovables, there is no problemthe lex situs is easily identified; for movables, the most common form is choses in action such as shares and bonds, and their location does not change (bearer bonds and other instruments where title is determined by mere possession are relatively uncommon), but for tangible assets, this will usually be the place where the assets are located at the time of the hearing given that this represents the place where any Court Order would have to be enforced: see property (conflict)); # the place where the trustee is resident or conducts his or her business; # the place where the purpose or object of the trust is to be fulfilled. Despite the identification of these four factors, the court must actually perform a rounded evaluation of all the circumstances. Thus, it would be relevant to consider the distribution of the assets if in separate states, the purpose of the trust (which might be the evasion of taxation or other provisions in some of the states where the assets are located), the lex domicilii or lex patriae of the settlor and the beneficiaries (particularly if the legal transaction is a marriage settlement or testamentary), the legal form of the document, and the law of the place where the document was executed (this latter factor may either be accidental and so of marginal value, or contrived to take advantage of a favourable law and so highly significant). The scope of the applicable law Under Article 8, the law specified by Article 6 or 7 shall govern the validity of the trust, its construction, its effects, and the administration of the trust. In particular that law shall govern: :(a) the appointment, resignation and removal of trustees, the capacity to act as a trustee, and the devolution of the office of trustee; :(b) the rights and duties of trustees among themselves; :(c) the right of trustees to delegate in whole or in part the discharge of their duties or the exercise of their powers; :(d) the power of trustees to administer or to dispose of trust assets , to create security interests in the trust assets, or to acquire new assets; :(e) the powers of investment of trustees; :(f) restrictions upon the duration of the trust, and upon the power to accumulate the income of the trust; :(g) the relationships between the trustees and the beneficiaries including the personal liability of the trustees to the beneficiaries; :(h) the variation of termination of the trust (because variation is expressly within the scope of the Applicable Law, this may be a significant factor in any issue of forum non conveniens raised if an application to vary is made to a forum other than a forum of the Applicable Law); :(i) the distribution of the trust assets; :(j) the duty of trustees to account for their administration. Severance Articles 9 and 10 allow the Applicable Law by which the validity of the trust has been established, to sever aspects of the trust and its administration so that separate laws shall apply to each component. In fact, the settlor may expressly select an Applicable Law for each component and the forum court should respect his or her wishes. But, in general terms, it is desirable that a single law should be applied to the administration and the fact that there may be assets located in separate states should not, per se, justify severing the trust. The relevant lex situs can be applied to micromanage the asset(s) by the trustee(s) without having to apply the situs law to the administration of the trust in that state. Equally, this is not an argument for a judicial approach which favours the law of the place of administration as the Applicable Law. Although the administration must comply with the municipal laws for general purposes, the duty to honour the intentions of the settlor may make the law of the place where the most significant part of that intention is to be realised the most significant single law. Recognition Under Article 11, a trust complying with the Applicable Law shall be recognised as a trust which implies, as a minimum, that the trust property constitutes a separate fund, that the trustee may sue and be sued in his capacity as trustee, and that he or she may appear or act in this capacity before a notary or any person acting in an official capacity. In so far as the law applicable to the trust requires or provides, this recognition implies in particular: :(a) that personal creditors of the trustee shall have no recourse against the trust assets; :(b) that the trust assets shall not form part of the trustee's estate upon his insolvency or bankruptcy; :(c) that the trust assets shall not form part of the matrimonial property of the trustee or his spouse nor part of the trustee's estate upon his death; :(d) that the trust assets may be recovered when the trustee, in breach of trust, has mingled trust assets with his own property or has alienated trust assets. However, the rights and obligations of any third party holder of the assets shall remain subject to the law determined by the choice of law rules of the lex fori. Thus, although the Convention makes provision for the trustee(s) and any third parties, it fails to address the position of the beneficiaries who, for example, might wish to pursue assets intermixed with the trustee's personal property through actions for tracing. One of the problems that beneficiaries might encounter is addressed in Article 12 which considers the problem where the situs law does not have a title registration system which reflects ownership registration in a representative capacity. While recognising that the Convention cannot require states to modify their existing registers, it provides that the trustee shall be entitled, in so far as this is not prohibited by or inconsistent with the law of the State where registration is sought, to do so in his capacity as trustee or in such other way that the existence of the trust is disclosed. This implicitly recognises the desirability of all registration systems distinguishing between beneficial and representative titles. This general difficulty of municipal laws failure to support trusts is addressed in Article 13, which considers the situation of those who wish to create a trust but can only do so by invoking laws entirely outside their own state. As an application of comity, no forum state is bound to recognise a trust the significant elements of which, except for the choice of the applicable law, the place of administration and the habitual residence of the trustee, are more closely connected with States which do not have the institution of the trust or the category of trust involved. But, because this could be interpreted as an invitation not to validate otherwise perfectly appropriate financial arrangements for deserving beneficiaries, Article 14 provides that the Convention shall not prevent the application of rules of law more favourable to the recognition of trusts. This reflects the positive rules of public policy which require that the validity of a transaction (whether commercial or not) be upheld if at all possible where this will give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties. The only exceptions shall be where this will produce consequences offending against the mandatory policies of the forum court in which case Article 18 empowers the court to deny the Applicable Law, even if it has been expressly selected by the settlor. But Article 15(2) nevertheless requires the forum court to consider adopting an approach that will preserve the overall validity of the trust insofar as that generality does not offend against the mandatory policy.

It was released in April 1979 by Arista Records in the United Kingdom and in June 1979 on Passport Records in the United States. After completing Private Parts & Pieces (1978), an album of home recordings that Phillips had recorded years before but remained unreleased, Phillips returned to making a commercial record. The UK release saw the first 5,000 copies of Sides packaged with a Collectors Album edition of Private Parts & Pieces. Background and recording Following the release of his second album Wise After the Event in May 1978, Phillips started work on his next record which was to be an album of all fresh material. However, the writing sessions had Phillips in doubt as to whether his re-emergence as a recording artist in 1977 was at the right time, as his progressive style of music was becoming increasingly out of fashion. Phillips also had difficulty in deciding what musical direction to undertake, and saw little value in recording more folk and romantic-oriented music which he had done on his first album The Geese & the Ghost (1977) and Wise After the Event. His label, the US-based Passport Records, put pressure on him to deliver more radio friendly songs. During the preparation of the album's material, Phillips called upon producer and songwriter Rupert Hine and drummer Michael Giles to assist, both of whom had worked on Wise After the Event. Phillips was soon advised by Passport and his own management to include guest vocalists as they deemed his songwriting ability strong enough, but figured other singers would benefit the material in a commercial sense. Phillips was attracted to this idea as he lacked the confidence to handle all the lead vocals himself, and hired singers Dan Owen and Dale Newman, the latter once a member of the Genesis road crew. Before recording began, Phillips and the group rehearsed for two weeks at Farmyard Studios in Buckinghamshire. They completed some songs there, including \\"Um & Aargh\\" which was an easy track for them to put together, and \\"Nightmare\\". Recording began in October 1978 at Essex Studios in London. The best takes of each track were transferred to a 24-track master to allow room for overdubs and vocals, and it was decided to mix down the original 16-track recordings for four songs, \\"Sisters of Remindum\\", \\"Bleak House\\", \\"Magdalen\\", and \\"Nightmare\\", straight onto the master. Both masters were then synchronised during the mixing stage. Recording then moved to Matrix Studios in London, where engineering duties were overseen by Nick Bradford, and the overdubs were put down at Trident Studios. After completing a rough mix of \\"Catch You When You Fall\\", a proposed song for the album, Phillips was unsatisfied with the lyrics and left it off. It remained unreleased until Archive Collection Volume I in 1998. In December 1978, after preparing a master copy, President[what's this?] manager Marty Scott suggested that some tracks would benefit from a remix or added instrumentation. A final recording session was booked, whereby Collins played the saxophone on \\"Side Door\\" and the track was remixed, and \\"Um & Aargh\\" was changed. A final session took place at Pye Studios on 11 January 1979 where Morris Pert added percussion to \\"Lucy Will\\" and \\"Nightmare\\". Phillips wanted name the album Balls in response to one comment that his songs \\"didn't have 'enough balls'\\", but was told that the title was \\"too eccentric\\", resulting in the change to Sides. This caused a problem with sleeve designer Peter Cross, his fourth cover for Phillips, as he had already completed the design. Reissues The album was first released on CD in 1990 by Virgin Records. This original CD release contained two extra tracks: \\"Souvenir\\" and an instrumental version of \\"Magdalen\\". As part of Voiceprint's re-issuing campaign of Ant's back catalogue, the album was re-issued in 2010 as an expanded 2 CD edition. The album was re-mastered from the original master tapes by Simon Heyworth and includes the non-album track \\"Souvenir\\" as an extra track on the first CD. This is in keeping with the track order of the original CD release. The second CD contains variations and alternate mixes of the songs from the album including some unique new mixes which have been made from the original multi-track masters especially for the release. The instrumental version of \\"Magdalen\\", which appeared as bonus track at the end of the original CD issue, has been moved to the second disc of this release. Also included is the edited single version of \\"Um & Aargh\\" which has not previously been available on CD. The second CD also contains two tracks originally intended for inclusion on the original album. \\"Catch You When You Fall\\" was recorded for the album but was left off because Ant was unhappy with the lyrics. A rough mix was included on Archive Collection Volume One, the version included on the bonus CD is newly mixed in instrumental form from the 24-track master. \\"Before The Night\\" was left off the album in place of \\"Bleak House\\" as it was decided to include only one piano-based ballad. On April 22, 2016, Esoteric Recordings (a Cherry Red Records label) released a 4-disc deluxe edition of the album. Disc 1 contains a 2016 stereo remix of the album. Disc 2 contains the bonus material (as on the 2010 release). Disc 3 contains a remastered version of the original stereo mix of the album. Disc 4 contains a 2016 5.1 surround sound mix of the album on a DVD. The deluxe edition also includes a poster and a 20-page booklet with photos and extensive liner notes.

Early life and education Moore was born in Dundalk, Ireland, and attended Dublin Institute of Technology, where he attained a degree in Media Arts. Upon completing his course, Moore genuinely believed that he wouldn't go on to work within the medium of film, but after a few years, that promptly changed. Career After graduating, he wrote and directed a series of short films in Ireland. Several of these shorts have featured on Irish TV networks over the years, and along the way Moore founded an Irish-based production company called Clingfilms. He then went on to direct several commercials, including the launch advertisement for Dreamcast, which 20th Century Studios found so impressive they gave him the $17 million (BTL) budget for Behind Enemy Lines. To date, Moore has made five films for 20th Century Fox: Behind Enemy Lines (2001), Flight of the Phoenix (2004), The Omen (2006), Max Payne (2008) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013). Despite receiving mixed reviews, both Behind Enemy Lines and The Omen did well at the box office. Flight of the Phoenix, however, received mainly negative reviews and grossed just under $35 million worldwide, much less than the film's budget. The behind the scenes documentary on the DVD shows him at multiple points berating crew on set. Max Payne also receiving mainly negative reviews, but became a box office success, grossing $85 million on a $35 million budget. A Good Day to Die Hard has also received mostly negative reviews, but grossed $304 million on a $92 million budget, making it his highest-grossing film. In September 2008, Moore was involved in a dispute with the MPAA over the certification of his film Max Payne. The MPAA initially gave the film an R rating, which Moore argued against. The film was reedited and the rating was a month later changed to PG-13, just before theatrical distribution. In late 2010, Moore was announced to be the director for the recent Die Hard film, A Good Day to Die Hard. The film premiered worldwide on 14 February 2013. Moore was also considered to direct X-Men: The Last Stand as well as Friday the 13th. In 2007 Moore obtained the rights to direct an adaptation of The Book of Lost Things through his Point Road production company. The rights have since lapsed. Personal life Moore's partner is Fiona Connon, a makeup artist whom he met through an industry friend early in his career in Ireland. They have one child, Buzz. The family reside in the US, and occasionally visit Ireland. in 2015 Moore expressed a desire to return home, but the nature of his work in Hollywood largely prevented it. Moore told the BBC in September 2004 that he firmly professes a belief in God. When asked if he was either religious or spiritual, Moore replied: In 2013 Moore opened up about his struggles with alcohol. He has been sober since 2008, following what he describes as an intense period of drinking upon finishing promotional duties for Max Payne.https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/drinking-die-hard- and-me-29120438.html Critical evaluation Despite his films receiving mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, for the most part Moore's films have proved popular with audiences. Critic Armond White has described Moore as \\"a Peckinpah-esque, neo-Eisenstein stylist whose grade-B material (Behind Enemy Lines, Flight of the Phoenix, The Omen) has kept him from receiving the acclaim he deserves\\". In his review of Max Payne, White had stated that Moore \\"explores genuine, contemporary anxiety [and that] his images are richer than his plots\\". Daniel M. Kimmel, writing for the New England Movies Weekly, found the film to be better than Live Free or Die Hard and states that the car chase scene \\"is well worth the price of admission\\". With a 3.5/5 rating, Kimmel summed up his review saying, \\"it's probably a good day to end the series at last, but it's an action-packed and entertaining finale.\\" Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail criticized the action scenes as being \\"messy\\", but concluded his review saying that the film \\"continues the franchise without undue embarrassment.\\" Filmography  Feature films  * Behind Enemy Lines (2001) * Flight of the Phoenix (2004) * The Omen (2006) * Max Payne (2008) * A Good Day to Die Hard (2013) * I.T.

It is part of the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District (LVJUSD). In 2007, it was chosen as one in four schools in Alameda County to receive the California Distinguished School award. History Founding F. R. Fassett, who was one of the leading citizens of Livermore and served in the State Legislature in 1890, introduced a bill which allowed any township to establish a union high school. Livermore established its high school, which was opened in 1891 with E. H. Walker as teacher and principal, in one of the rooms of the Livermore Grammar School. The Class of 1893 was first to graduate from Livermore Union High School. The contract for the first high school building was agreed upon on December 31, 1892. The building consisted of eight rooms and was finished in the summer of 1893 on the site of what is now a Livermore Area Recreation and Parks District Facility. Expansion Immediately after spring vacation in 1930, the high school students moved into a new two-story, red brick building with 14 classrooms and an auditorium, located at the present site. In 1939, the building was made earthquake-proof and refinished with a stucco face. Since then, many new classrooms, buildings, and facilities have been added. During the 1988-89 school year the auditorium was completely renovated, and is now known as the Livermore High School Performing Arts Theater. In 2005, the quadrangle was renovated to include an outdoor amphitheater. In 2009, new science buildings were created and the temporary classrooms were removed. Academics Livermore offers a wide variety of courses, including many Advanced Placement and honors courses. The curriculum consists of course offerings in English, mathematics, history and social sciences, foreign languages (French, Spanish, Latin, and German), visual arts (photography, ceramics, drawing, video production, animation), music (concert/symphonic and marching band, orchestra, jazz ensemble, concert and show choir, chamber chorale, music composition), theater and performing arts, economics, government, journalism, psychology, technology, and science (biology, physics, earth sciences, chemistry, anatomy and physiology, and field biology). Livermore High School is home to the LHS Green Engineering Academy, a program to promote engineering through hands-on learning activities and applications of engineering to all areas of the students academics. GEA is open to 60 students per year. In October 2012, GEA won the prestigious Golden Bell AwardGolden Bell Award for outstanding academic programs in a California classroom. The GEA gained further success and publicity through students' audits of Bay Area schools, being featured on ABC 7 News, CBS 5 News, and KQED 88.5 FM radio, The Alameda County Office of EducationAlameda County Office of Education kW Engineering,kW Engineering and PG&E.; At the minimum, students are required to complete three years of history/social science courses, four years of English, two years of mathematics, two years of science, one year of a foreign language, one year of a visual or performing arts, two years of physical education, one semester of health, and 80 credits of elective courses. Advanced Placement courses offered include English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, French Language, Spanish Language, Studio Art (2-D, 3-D, and Drawing), Psychology, Chemistry, Calculus AB and BC, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Biology, United States History, World History, and Computer Science. Livermore High School is also a member of the Tri-Valley Regional Occupation Program (ROP),Tri-Valley Regional Occupation Program (ROP) hosting numerous ROP classes such as Auto Body, Environmental Science, Criminal Justice, and Marketing. Livermore High is also the only school in Alameda County to still have a branch of the Future Farmers of America. A number of graduates matriculate to four-year colleges, mostly within the University of California and California State University systems. Athletics Livermore High School competes in the following sports: * Fall: cross country, football, girls' volleyball, water polo, girls' tennis, girls' golf,cheerleading * Winter: basketball, soccer, wrestling, winter percussion * Spring: track and field, boys' volleyball, softball, baseball, swimming and diving, boys' tennis, boys' golf, and lacrosse Livermore competes in the North Coast Section (NCS) and East Bay Athletic League (EBAL). The Cowboys wrestling program has won a total of 18 EBAL titles since first being established in 1963 (Head Coach James Comella).Under Livermore wrestling coach Steve Page, the wrestling team won EBAL Championships in 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1998, 2003, and placed in the top five at the North Coast Section several times. Frisbee Goodall (1984), Bryan Vashus (1989), Clark Conover (1990), Derek Bowerman (1996), and Nico Lang (2013) each won CIF NCS individual titles while Tyler Rardon won two titles (2012-'13). In 2020, Timothy Cowan became the first sophomore to win an NCS title for the Cowboys. Clark Conover (1990), Scott Page (1990), Peter Matheson (1992), and Marc Kavanagh (1993/Chabot College HOF '16) each placed at the CIF State Championships, notably the toughest high school state wrestling tournament in the country. Andrew Koponen, Clark Conover, Brian Vashus, and Scott Page each earned All-American honors at the Freestyle and Greco-Roman Nationals. 1989 alumnus Andrew Koponen was a bronze medalist at the United States Olympic Festival. In 2016, longtime coaches Steve Page and Al Fontes (alumni 1984) were inducted into the California Wrestling Hall of Fame for the Lifetime Service Award, and in 2019 Clark Conover joined his coaches and was also awarded the Lifetime Service Award. Garen McDonald is the only wrestler in Cowboys history to win a California Interscholastic Federation State Championship (1980). McDonald went on to win a California Community College State Championship title for Chabot College and earned NCAA Division II All- American honors while competing for Cal State Bakersfield. In 2004, McDonald was inducted into the Chabot College Hall-of-Fame. In 2019, Ximena Pulido became the first wrestler in the girl's division to earn All-American honors at the USAW Folkstyle Nationals. Under Livermore cross country coach Ed Salazar, the cross country team set a NCS record with seven straight section titles from 1990-1996. During this period Micheil Jones (1994)https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/Results/Meet.aspx?Meet=8243 and Joe Smith (1995)https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/Results/Meet.aspx?Meet=31416 won individual state cross country titles.

It now covers and runs for five days. This used to be from the Wednesday after the UK August bank holiday, but from 2016 has been from the Thursday before the Bank Holiday until the Bank Holiday itself. It is reputedly the largest collection of steam and vintage equipment to be seen anywhere in the world. The fair was founded by the Dorset Steam & Historic Vehicle Club, and has been held in Dorset, England, every summer since 1969. The show is now organised by Michael Oliver's son, Martin Oliver, through Great Dorset Steam Fair Ltd. History Established in 1969, for the first 15 years of its existence the steam fair (then known as the 'Great Working of Steam Engines') was held at Stourpaine Bushes, then in 1985 it temporarily moved to nearby Everley Hill, as Bushes Farm were delayed in harvesting the crops from the fields used by the steam fair due to the weather conditions. In 1988, after 3 years at Everley Hill, where access by large crowds was difficult, it moved to its current permanent home at Tarrant Hinton, north of Blandford Forum, where access is vastly improved. The fair now attracts up to 200,000 visitors. In 2020, the event was cancelled for the first time since its inception due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Coronavirus: Great Dorset Steam Fair cancels 2020 event Exhibits The steam fair in 2004 The most numerous exhibits are traction engines, tractors and farm machinery, but there are also sections for classic cars and commercial vehicles, working shire horses, rustic crafts, 'bygones' displays, and more. The show also has a market, autojumble, live music and funfair (some of which is powered by the steam engines). The funfair has traditional rides such as gallopers and steam boats, as well as modern ones like the \\"World Fair Wheel\\" which was sited in Manchester for the millennium. It is the biggest gathering of fairground organs in the UK. The show regularly attracts around 200,000 visitors,Preview of 38th Fair, BBC Dorset, 2006. and there can be 30,000 people on site, making the fair the fifth largest population centre in Dorset, after Bournemouth, Poole, Weymouth and Christchurch (the population of the historic town of Dorchester being only half that number).Paul Appleton and Ian Allan, A Celebration of Great Dorset Steam, 2006. . A speciality of the show is the display of traction engines and steam rollers performing the work for which they were designed. Such displays include heavy haulage, threshing, sawing logs, ploughing and road-making. The main arena of the show is purposely sited on the slope of a hill to allow both steam- and internal combustion-powered machinery to demonstrate their capacity for heavy load hauling. One of the main displays is the \\"Showman's Line up\\", in the vintage fairground section, which is thought to be the largest collection of showman's engines in the world. Since 2003, the show has contracted its own radio station, Steam Fair FM, broadcasting 24 hours daily on 87.9 FM from the Sunday prior to the show, to the Tuesday following – 10 days in all. The station, which is also streamed on the internet, covers show news and views, weather and other relevant information with plenty of listener dedications and a format of \\"Vintage Hits\\". During the event, the station is advertised on roads in the surrounding area and provides traffic news for drivers using the A354 Blandford to Salisbury road that passes the show site. For the 40th anniversary, in 2008, the organisers recreated the very first fair, by tracing all of the exhibits that were displayed at the 1969 show.Great Dorset Steam Fair – 2008 Programme. Directors' Thanksgiving Service The end of the fair used to be marked with the Director's Thanksgiving Service on the Sunday, at 12 noon, which took place on the stage of Dean's Bioscope, organised for many years by Chris Edmonds, the Lay Chaplain until his death in 2007. The Rev'd Dr Michael Foster, a friend of Chris, and the local Rector of Tarrant Hinton, continued to organise the Thanksgiving Service, with Sally, Chris' widow. Fr Michael was appointed Chaplain to the Show at the Thanksgiving Service September 2011, having been Assistant Chaplain for some four years. It was Fr Michael who conducted the founder of the Fair, Michael Oliver's Funeral in 2009. The Directors' Thanksgiving Service is now organised to begin the Show, on the opening Wednesday, as was the practice in some past years. Dorset Sound Festival Night-time view of the line-up of showman's engines, in the fairground (2007). 2008 saw the start of the Dorset Sound Festival, a music event that is held alongside the main fair, designed to entertain a wide variety of musical tastes. The festival included five stages: the Main Stage, Real Ale Stage, Folk Stage, Country & Western Marquee and the Black Bull Marquee. Bands featured were mainly tribute acts, including the Bootleg Beatles. In 2009, the Main Stage was changed from being inside a marquee to an outdoor concert stage. This required a concert ticket to be purchased unlike the other marquees that are free to visitors of the fair. 2009 saw the start of a new event called Steam Sounds that showcases unsigned artists from around the local area on the outdoor stage. The Main Stage is now free to all and does not require a ticket for entry as of 2014 World Records On 31 August 2013, GDSF set a new World Record for the largest parade of steam rollers, when 103 rollers were driven into the main arena for a photo call. The previous record had been set by GDSF in 2003 with 32 steam rollers. The requirements for the record attempt, which took place on a newly created 80m-long (260 ft) section of road at the showground, included the fact the vehicles had to be moving. The citation from Guinness World Records is as follows: A regular section of the fair is the road making demonstration, where workers in period costume use vintage equipment to demonstrate how roads were built before the invention of tarmacadam, using crushed stone. An extra section of road was built during the 2013 show, for the purpose of breaking the record: \\"greatest number of steam rollers going over a newly laid piece of road\\". The 103 steam rollers, and a large number of diesel rollers, were all driven over the new section of road before continuing to the main arena. \\"Lord Jellicoe\\", a Fowler formerly owned by the founder of the fair, Michael Oliver, was the 33rd roller in the procession and hence the first to break the record. Also taking part in the parade was \\"Betsy\\", the Aveling & Porter roller restored by steeplejack, Fred Dibnah. The 2001 event also saw the public debut of the home-built Hudspith Steam Bicycle.  Founding Members  Michael Oliver was not the sole founder of the Great Dorset Steam Fair, and was a member of a dedicated group of enthusiasts. The list is as follows; President; Mr G. J. Romanes, M.A, M.R.C.S, D.O.M.S. Vice President; Mr E.C. Hines. Chairman; Mr J. E. B. Pocock Vice Chairman; Mr M. F. Oliver Treasurer; Mr N. J. Fincham Public relations officer; Mr A. Imber.

It is one of two high schools in the Decatur City School District. Decatur High offers technical, academic, and Advanced Placement (AP) programs, as well as dual enrollment with the John C. Calhoun Community College System. Decatur High, along with southwestern Decatur's Austin High School, were the first International Baccalaureate schools in Alabama north of Birmingham, Alabama. Starting the 2017-2018 school year, Decatur High will no longer continue the IB program. Athletics Ogle Stadium Decatur High's football and soccer programs play at the 9,000 seat Ogle Stadium at the southern end of the campus. The stadium, owned by the Decatur City Schools, is named for a former Decatur High coach, and Alabama Sports Hall of Famer, H. L. \\"Shorty\\" Ogle, who led the Red Raiders from 1933 to 1963. The high school's sports teams often use the field as a practice field. Prior to 1949, the Decatur football team played at the 3,000-person capacity Benson Field that is now a part of Rhodes Ferry Park along the shores of the Tennessee River next to the old Riverview High School. Prior to 2018, when Austin High relocated and got a stadium of its own, both of the high schools in Decatur played their home games in the stadium. The one exception was the Decatur vs. Austin game. In that case, one team sat on the away side while the other occupied the home side. The schools alternated each year. This football game usually sold out the stadium, and brought in crowds of over 10,000 to watch the city's major rivalry. Football Decatur High has produced many players that went on to play at the collegiate and professional levels, including Jerraud Powers and Rolando McClain. Basketball Decatur High School has had one boys' state championship under coach Earl Morris and five girls' state championships under coach Mike Smith. The 1948 basketball team was the first Decatur team to go to the state tournament, but it did not win the county tournament. Soccer The Decatur High School girls' soccer team defeated Briarwood Christian in the class 5A Alabama State Championship game on May 10, 2008. Visual arts Decatur High School's Visual Arts department offers a wide range of art courses that include Drawing and Painting (Art I – IB/AP Studio Art), Ceramics, Graphic Design, and Photography. A scaffolded curriculum is in place to prepare students for portfolio coursework in IB (International Baccalaureate) Visual Art or AP Studio Art classes. In addition to ongoing competition exhibitions, student work is exhibited throughout the year at Decatur General Hospital, in the fall at the All City Music and Art Festival, and at Decatur High during their spring art exhibit. Students in the IB and AP Art courses have scored above the world average for the past two years. Students who excel in the visual arts at Decatur High School, who exhibit exemplary character and meet academic requirements are invited to join the National Art Honor Society (NAHS). NAHS was created by the National Art Education Association for the purpose of inspiring and recognizing those students who have shown an outstanding ability in art. NAHS members at Decatur High School complete art related service hours for the Carnegie Visual Arts Center and to create ceramic bowls to raise money for North Alabama food pantries. Decatur High School students participate annually in various city, state, and national competitions. In 2011−12 students placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in the citywide PTA Reflections competition. A DHS senior was awarded a regional Gold Key in the prestigious Scholastic Art and Writing Award competition, a regional Blue Ribbon in the district 5 VAA competition, and also earned one of three portfolio scholarships in the Alabama State Council on the Arts Visual Arts Achievement Program that is annually adjudicated by college professionals from the Southeast according to AP College Board guidelines. The Decatur High School art department actively promotes the success of their students through participation in state and nationally recognized competitions and assists students in applications for portfolio and academic merit scholarships. During the 2011–12 school year, students received over $140,000 in visual art scholarships. Band The Decatur High School's Chorus and Concert Bands have consistently received superior ratings in both District and State festivals. Decatur High has the longest string of District Festival Superior Ratings in Alabama, dating back to the festival's formation in 1947, never receiving anything less than a superior rating. Decatur High also continues to lead in total number of Alabama Bandmasters State Festival Superior Ratings at 58, more than any other high school in state history. The Decatur Red Raider Marching Band won the Tennessee Valley Invitational at Muscle Shoals High School in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 2006. Since then, the band has won its class twice at the Vanderbilt Marching Invitational. During their undefeated 2010 season, the Red Raider Marching Band became the first ever band from the state of Alabama to win a class at the prestigious Contest of Champions in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Contest of Champions is the oldest marching contest in America with 49 straight years of competition. In 2013, the band once again won the Tennessee Valley Invitational at Muscle Shoals High School. Notable alumni *Paul T.

Kaiser ranked 20th among U.S. corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p. 619. The shipyards were owned by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, a creation of American industrialist Henry J. Kaiser (1882–1967), who established the shipbuilding company around 1939 in order to help meet the construction goals set by the United States Maritime Commission for merchant shipping. Four of the Kaiser Shipyards were located in Richmond, California, and were called the Richmond Shipyards. Three other shipyards were located in the Pacific Northwest along the Columbia and Willamette rivers: the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation and the Swan Island Shipyard in Portland, Oregon, and the Vancouver Shipyard in Vancouver, Washington.Herman, pp. 209, 269, 271, 275. Henry Kaiser was known for developing new methods of ship building, which allowed his yards to outproduce other similar facilities and build 1,490 ships, 27 percent of the total Maritime Commission construction. Kaiser's ships were completed in two-thirds the time and a quarter the cost of the average of all other shipyards. Liberty ships were typically assembled in a little over two weeks, and one in less than five days.Herman, pp. 176–91. Kaiser Shipyards shut down at the end of the war. The Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park was dedicated October 25, 2000 on the site of one of the shipyards in Richmond.  History  Henry Kaiser had been building cargo ships for the Maritime Commission in the 1930s, partnering with Todd Pacific Shipyards and the Bath Iron Works. When orders for ships from the British government, already at war with Germany, allowed for growth, Kaiser established his first Richmond shipyard begun in December 1940.Herman, pp. 22, 123–24, 130–37. In April 1941 the Maritime Commission requested an additional Kaiser yard, to be used for Liberty ship construction, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kaiser started third and fourth yards, building troop transports and tank landing ships (LSTs), respectively. His son, Edgar Kaiser, Sr, was appointed Vice-President and General Manager of the shipyards.Herman, pp. 132–34, 137, 178–89, 1914, 269, 271. Together, these four Kaiser Shipyards produced 747 ships, including many of the famous Liberty ships and Victory shipsfor carrying general cargo and military munitions, armaments and supplies, more than any other complex in the United States. Only one of these ships, , survives. Two other Liberty ships built in other American yards also exist as working museum exhibits: moored in San Francisco and in Baltimore. An additional Victory cargo ship also survives: . Kaiser also produced the s.  Other details  * Kaiser set several records: ** The Liberty ship SS Robert E. Peary was assembled in less than five days as a part of a special competition among shipyards. ** At the Oregon Shipbuilding Yard on the Columbia River, near Portland, the Victory ship SS Joseph N. Teal was built in ten days in fall 1942. * The Oregon Shipbuilding Yards were responsible for 455 ships. * Kaiser recruited from across the United States to work in his yards, hiring women and minorities. * Fields Point in Providence, Rhode Island, had a shipyard temporarily run by Kaiser-Walsh when the former management ran into difficulties. The shipyard was closed and sold after the war to a Swedish shipowner who dismantled the shipyard and later erected it in the city of Uddevalla on the west coast of Sweden.

She is a magical being, one of the last surviving members of an almost-extinct race of insect-winged humans, the Rahtumi. Grace has been a lead character in two Aspen Comics series thus far, Soulfire and Soulfire: Dying of the Light. Fictional character biography Though she appears youthful, Grace is thousands of years old. She was born and came of age during the \\"last Age of Magic\\", an ancient time when magic was plentiful on Earth and all manner of creatures now considered mythical (such as dragons) still existed. During the events that culminated with the Dying of the Light, Grace was a princess of the Kingdom of Empyrea; however, as a plague destroyed all things magical and the Age ended, she faded into obscurity. While most magical beings, including almost all of the Rahtumi, perished, Grace somehow survived, though losing both her wings and her access to magic. Grace resurfaces in the year 2211, her wings and abilities restored. She makes an alliance with a young orphan named Malikai. Malikai is the first new Rahtumi born in centuries, and he may be the key to reviving magic in the soulless future world dominated by technology and ruthless corporations. Grace's life mission is to protect Malikai at all costs so that he may have a chance to fulfill his destiny by ushering in a new Age of Magic. Physical description Grace is pictured as a stunningly beautiful, lithe, athletic woman with large and powerful dragonfly wings on her back. She uses the wings for flight and, at least on one occasion, as weapons - despite their delicate appearance, the wings are strong enough to block incoming blows and inflict damage. When not in flight, Grace folds the wings along her back, and they can be concealed by a cloak. Grace has a tattoo of dragonfly wings on her face and a full dragonfly tattoo on her back. The meaning of these markings is not yet known, but they may have something to do with her status as the \\"chosen one\\" of her race. The \\"modern\\" Grace is seen wearing typical skin-tight outfits typical of superheroes with elements of armor. Her depictions from both the Dying of the Light series and from the main Soulfire run suggest that she prefers minimal clothing, and her wardrobe often includes a flowing, translucent half-skirt. In cover art, and when not in battle, she is frequently pictured barefoot, although she also wears sandals. Powers and abilities Grace is a capable fighter skilled in both unarmed combat and with a variety of melee weapons. She seems to prefer polearms (mostly, some type of spear) as she finds it well-suited for aerial combat. Grace appears somewhat stronger than most humans. Grace literally has centuries of combat and survival experience, which she presumably accumulated throughout the \\"Dark Ages\\" when her magic abilities were limited or nonexistent. During the period of time pictured in Soulfire series, she has regained the use of magic; however, so far it seems limited to projecting energy beams and creating energy shields. She may have many additional abilities that haven't been revealed yet. An adversary (Onyx) once recognized Grace as a \\"goddess\\" and promptly fled, not wanting to confront someone so vastly powerful. What these abilities are and whether Grace has immediate access to them is unclear.

She uses her art work to make statements about perceived injustices against Māori. 2015 January–August Wellington Community centre. She is well known for her landscape sculpture commission for Te Aro Park (also called Pigeon Park) in central Wellington. The ceramic tile permanent work is considered one of New Zealand's most successful public sculptures. Set in a narrow triangle of public space with adjacent busy roads and much foot traffic it is a very visible work. One of Rapira Davies' major works, the sculptural installation Nga Morehu (1988), the title of which translates to 'the survivors', is held by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, along with preparatory drawings. The work was originally made for Whakamamae ('to feel pain'), an exhibition Rapira Davies had with painter Robyn Kahukiwa at the Wellington City Art Gallery in 1988. Ngā Morehu pays tribute to the strength and resilience of Māori women. The work depicts the karanga, the call of welcome performed by women which begins ceremonial occasions, through a group of terracotta figures arranged on an unfinished whāriki (woven flax mat). The whāriki is mentioned by Rapira Davies as being the defining component of the piece. Her daughter completed the weaving after very little instruction, and which Rapira Davies describes as her journey into adulthood. A naked female child faces a group of women advancing towards her, performing the karanga, and at the end of the mat is a seated kuia (female elder). The body of the child is adorned with the words of a contemporary poem and that of the kaikaranga (the women leading the karanga) with the words of a waiata (a song), while the other female forms carry racial slurs. Curator Megan Tamati- Quennell writes: > Reflecting the rise of the political Māori voice and the place of feminism > in New Zealand art at the time, Ngā Morehu portrays the impact of > colonisation on Māori culture and Māori women particularly. Yet Rapira > Davies' work suggest transcendence too, by revealing a ritual state rarely > portrayed, and through it, a Māori definition of beauty, status and worth. In 2015 Te Papa opened a focus exhibition on Rapira Davies and fellow senior artist Emily Karaka which includes Ngā Morehu alongside preparatory sketches and more recent works.

Public transportation Vienna has a large public transportation network. * Vienna S-Bahn * Vienna U-Bahn * Local Railways (Lokalbahn Wien- Baden) * Wiener Linien (= Vienna Lines, municipal company operating the U-Bahn, Vienna's tramway network, and most Bus routes) * Carsharing (= cars parked in the city you can rent per minute DriveNow) Vienna has an extensive train and bus network. The convenience and flexibility of the public transport system is reflected by its popularity; 53% of Viennese workers travel to their workplace by public transport.Der Standard, Tuesday 27 March 2007 The overall modal split was 39% public transport and 27% private transport in 2016, compared to 29% and 40% respectively in 1993. Fares within the city cover all modes of public transport and are available for various time periods, such as for 24 hours, calendar weeks and calendar months. Tourist and yearly tickets are also available. Passengers must buy tickets prior to boarding or entering a station; however, on buses and trams, tickets can be bought or validated on board. There are no ticket barriers or inspections when entering public transit system, however transit inspectors - often in plainclothes - do conduct random ticket inspections on certain lines. The Viennese public transport services are incorporated into a larger concentric system of transport zones, the VOR (Verkehrsverbund Ostregion = eastern region transport association). VOR includes railway and bus lines operating into the surrounding areas, and ticket prices are calculated according to the number of zones crossed, Vienna being a single zone. Air transport Vienna International Airport Vienna International Airport is located to the southeast of Vienna. The airport handled 22 million passengers in 2012. Following lengthy negotiations with surrounding communities, the airport will be expanded to increase its capacity by adding a third runway. The airport is currently undergoing a major expansion, including a new terminal building opened in 2012 to prepare for an expected increase in passengers. Another airport that's rather close to the city is Bratislava Airport in Slovakia. The airport is primarily used by low-cost airlines, such as Ryanair. It is a couple of miles away from the city, which means that Bratislava & Vienna shares each other's airports, due to the fact that both cities are not far away from each other. Maritime transport * Vienna is connected to Rotterdam and German industrial areas via the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal, and to Eastern European countries along the Danube to the Black Sea. Construction on a Danube-Oder Canal was begun during the Nazi era but remains unfinished, though it may be completed in the future. * The Twin City Liner boat service connects Vienna and Bratislava. * Nearly all of Vienna's drinking water is brought from the Alps to the city via two large water pipelines, built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The pipelines stretch and from the Alps to Hietzing (the city's 13th district). The Alpine sources are pristine and the water does not require treatment.  Rail transport  Trains are operated by the ÖBB. Historically, all transport was oriented towards the main cities in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Vienna has two remaining train terminals that form the beginning of several train lines: * Wien Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof, the starting point of the Franz Joseph Railway * Wien Westbahnhof, starting point of the West railway There are also several through train stations: Wien Hauptbahnhof * Wien Hauptbahnhof, a new central station due to replace two former terminals. It currently serves local trains on the East Railway and S-Bahn services but will become the main long-distance station upon full opening in 2014. * Wien Hütteldorf on the West railway * Wien Heiligenstadt on the Franz Joseph Railway * Wien Praterstern (Formerly known as Wien Nord or Wien Nord-Praterstern) on the North railway * Wien Meidling on the South railway. This is Vienna's most frequented transit station. * Wien Mitte (Landstraße) on the S-Bahn trunk line; it is the nearest railway station to the centre of the city. There are also a large number of smaller stations that are important for local passenger traffic. Since the mid-1990s, the Westbahnhof and Südbahnhof have handled all long-distance travel. Many trains also stop at Hütteldorf or Meidling, especially when inbound. In order to bundle all long-distance traffic it has become necessary to build a tunnel, colloquially known as the Wildschweintunnel (\\"boar tunnel\\"), underneath Lainzer Tiergarten linking the Western Railway to the Southern Railway. The new bundled train line will connect to the new Wien Hauptbahnhof that is being constructed on the site of the previous Südbahnhof.  Road transport  As in Austria generally, national highways are referred to as Bundesstrassen. Higher-capacity and higher-speed Bundesstrassen are further categorized into Autobahns and Schnellstrassen (expressways). Five automobile bridges cross the Danube river within the city. From north to south, they are the Nordbrücke, Floridsdorfer Brücke, Brigittenauer Brücke, Reichsbrücke and Praterbrücke. Autobahns The A23 autobahn in Vienna Five national autobahns leave Vienna in the westerly (A1), northwesterly (A22), northerly A5, easterly (A4), and southerly (A2) directions. Similarly to the rail lines, they are commonly referred to after their exit directions (Westautobahn, Südatobahn, Nordautobahn and Ostautobahn). In addition, several spur and branch autobahns circle around the southern and eastern areas of the city. Notably, the A23 Südosttangente connects the Süd Autobahn and Ostautobahn, and is the busiest road in Vienna. The protected Wienerwald forest area in the West and Northwest of the city has been left mostly untouched. Schnellstraßen Schnellstraßen are similar to Autobahns except that they have slight inferiorities such as lower posted speeds and smaller curve radii. Within Vienna one may find the S 1 Wiener Außenring Schnellstraße and S 2 Wiener Nordrand Schnellstraße. Bundesstraßen Similarly to the train lines, Bundesstraßen leave the city in a star-shaped pattern. Some are named after their historical final destinations; for example, Prager Straße to Prague, Linzer Straße to Linz, Triester Straße to Trieste and Brünner Straße to Brno (this last to be supplanted by the aforementioned A 5). Bundesstraßen can be compared to U.S. Highways in the United States, being two-lane in rural areas and multi-lane in urban areas.

It was released on June 22, 2004. The book was published by the Knopf Publishing Group and became a bestseller; the book sold in excess of 2,250,000 copies. Clinton had received what was at the time the world's highest book advance fee, $15 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Summary and themes In My Life, Clinton covered his life chronologically, beginning with his early years in Hope, Arkansas, and his family's move to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he attended school and learned the tenor saxophone. It later had a peripheral role in his political public appearances. He had an early interest in politics, which he pursued in college. He eventually ran for and won the Governorship of Arkansas, and later, the Presidency of the United States. Along the way, Clinton offers anecdotes of ordinary people he had interacted with over the years. Early in Clinton's life, he recalls listening to his family's stories of others and learning > that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged > by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites > of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that > laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain. Following his defeat for second term as governor, Clinton remarks, \\"the system can only absorb so much change at once; no one can beat all the entrenched interests at the same time; and if people think you've stopped listening, you're sunk.\\" In a political battle, he said that one should wait for an attack from his opponent, then counterpunch as strong and as fast as possible. Early gaffes in Clinton's political career were a result, he believed, of taking too long to respond to attacks. Writing process Clinton spent about two and a half years on the book. He gathered material for four months, wrote an outline, and spent two years and two months writing the book. The book's editor was Justin Cooper. \\"I wrote it out long hand, left blanks for research, he'd do the research, put it in the computer, print it out, and then we'd edit it,\\" Clinton said. \\"Every page in this book has probably been gone over somewhere between three and nine times.\\" The original draft for the book was written completely in long-hand. \\"[There were] 22 big, thick notebooks.\\"Clinton, Bill. The Late Show with David Letterman, CBS, 3 August 2004. Reaction At 1,008 pages, the memoir was chided for its length, with comedian Jon Stewart joking, \\"I have to confess, I did not finish the entire book; I'm on ... page 12,000.\\"Bill Clinton Part 2, The Daily Show, Comedy Central. President George W. Bush joked that it was \\"10,000 pages long.\\"President Bush Makes Fun of Himself (really) In 2007 Teletext carried out a survey of British readers, the results of which revealed that of the respondents who had purchased or borrowed My Life, 30 percent had either not read it, or had begun to read it but had not finished it. Clinton's former advisor Dick Morris wrote a rebuttal named Because He Could (2004), criticizing My Life. In his own book, Morris presented what he believed to be factual inaccuracies of different events Clinton depicted in My Life. White House intern Monica Lewinsky was highly critical of the autobiography, declaring that she had thought he would correct the false statements he made when he was trying to protect the Presidency. Clinton earned US$30 million as of April 2008 from the sales of My Life and his follow-up book, Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World. Editions In addition to the full-volume hardback that was initially released, several other editions followed, including: a limited deluxe edition that was numbered, slipcased, and autographed (); trade paperback; audio (read by Bill Clinton); and a mass market paperback edition separated into two volumes. The audiobook edition, read by Clinton and published by Random House Audio, won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. This was the second time Clinton had won the award; in February 2004, Clinton (along with former leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev and actress Sophia Loren) won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children.

History In Viewpoint School's first year, 1961, it occupied leased facilities in Encino, California and enrolled 24 students. Mrs. Thelma Sitton was the school's first principal. The school's enrollment and recognition grew. Portions of the campus moved west and for several years shared space with a church on Platt Avenue in Woodland Hills. For the 1965-66 school year, Viewpoint moved grades 6, 7, and 8 to its current location in Calabasas, constructing its first building (3 trailers) there. A permanent lower school building followed on shortly thereafter. As enrollment increased in the 1960s and 1970s, Viewpoint included additional grades to meet demand and Viewpoint graduated its first senior class in 1982. In this year, construction was also begun on Viewpoint's second academic building. Art O'Leary served as headmaster of Viewpoint from 1980-86. Dr. Robert J. Dworkoski began his term on O'Leary's retirement in 1986. In June 2014, after 28 years as Headmaster, Dr. Dworkoski moved into the role of President of the Viewpoint Educational Foundation. During the 2014-15 school year, Paul Rosenbaum served as Interim Head of School. As of June 2015, Mark McKee is Head of School. In 2005, Viewpoint opened a third building in the first phase of the School's Master Plan. A new athletic field was completed in 2007, a library in 2009, and a new arts and athletics facility was completed fall 2011. It includes state-of-the- art classrooms, science labs and art studios. The Paul Family Athletic Center features a 900-seat gymnasium for volleyball and basketball, as well as additional space for a fitness center, locker rooms and coaches' offices. In February 2015, the School opened the 4,100 square-foot Balaban-Webster Team Center to further enhance the School's athletic facilities. Curriculum As of 1988 the school offers French instruction from Pre-Kindergarten through grade 12, and Viewpoint required secondary students in grades 7-12 to have at least three years of foreign language instruction in French, Spanish, Latin or Mandarin. Foreign language instruction was 4 days per week for grades 9-12 and 5 days per week for grades 7 and 8.Lingre, Michele. \\"Early Linguists : Private Foreign-Language Schools Give Bilingual Education a New Twist.\\" Los Angeles Times.

He continued with 38 points against William & Mary, 40 points & 13 rebounds against St. John's, 31 points & 13 rebounds against William & Mary, and then 40 points & 7 rebounds against Pitt. He then had a season-high 42 points & 9 rebounds against Furman, then 26 points against Richmond. Senior season In his final collegiate season, in 1957, Hundley averaged 23.1 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. He began his senior season with 23 points and 9 rebounds in the first game, 25 points and 13 rebounds in the second game, and 28 points and 12 rebounds in the third game of the season. In the next contest against Penn State, Hundley scored 17 points and totaled 16 rebounds. He then had 25 points and 10 rebounds in the 83–82 upset over the Duke Blue Devils. He then had consecutive games of 24 points, the first with 9 rebounds and the second with 12. In the January 5 game against Furman, Hundley scored a career-high 54 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in the victory, a school record for points in a game. He followed the game up with a game of 32 points and then the following game with 34 points and 15 rebounds against Villanova. He then had three games of 21 points, 19 points and then 18 points. He then had a game of 30 points with 13 points against St. John's followed by a game of 34 points and 10 rebounds against VMI. He then had a five-game stretch of 32 points, 28 points, 23 points, 39 points, and 27 points and 20 rebounds. Legacy Hundley was the fourth player in NCAA history to score more than 2,000 points during his career—and he did it in three years, because freshman then could not play varsity basketball. He averaged 24.5 points and 10.6 rebounds per game for three seasons and finished his collegiate career with 2,180 points. He was a two-time, first team All-American and currently holds eight school records. He is one of only two Mountaineers to be drafted first overall in an NBA draft, with Mark Workman going first overall to the Milwaukee Hawks five years earlier in the 1952 NBA draft. Once on a trip back to West Virginia to play in a charity game at the WVU Coliseum, constructed more than 10 years after he left WVU, Rod was said to have told Basketball Hall of Famer and fellow WVU alumnus Jerry West: \\"I built this building.\\" West retorted, \\"Yeah but I paid it off.\\" Hundley was also memorable in school history for his on-court antics. He was famous for dribbling the ball behind his back, spinning the ball on his finger, rolling it down his arm, and even going around his back. He also often took hook shots at the free throw line and also would hang off the rim waiting for a lob pass from a teammate. In January 2010, WVU retired his number 33, making Hundley and West the only players in school history to be awarded the honor. On February 20, 2016 a bronze statue of him was unveiled outside the blue gate of the WVU Coliseum, joining the statue of West. Professional career In 1957, the Cincinnati Royals made Hundley the first pick of the NBA Draft and immediately traded his rights to the Minneapolis Lakers. Hundley and Mark Workman, who also attended West Virginia, (1957 NBA draft) are the only No. 1 overall draft picks to come from the same high school. Hundley played for the Lakers in Minneapolis and Los Angeles from 1957 until 1963, averaging 8.4 points per game and recording over 1,400 assists. He also played in two All Star games. His best season came in the 1959–60 season, when he averaged 12.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game. The next season, 1960, Hundley was teamed up with Mountaineer legend Jerry West, as he was drafted from WVU in that year's draft. Hundley finished his six-year professional career at age 28 (in 1963) due to his bad knees. His career totals were 3,625 points, 1,420 rebounds and 1,455 assists in his six seasons. Broadcasting career After his retirement, Hundley moved to the broadcast booth, working four seasons for the Phoenix Suns and four seasons for the Los Angeles Lakers. In the early 1970s, he also teamed with Dick Enberg to call syndicated college basketball for TVS. Hundley was an NBA announcer for five years for CBS, where he called four All-Star Games; he worked two All-Star Games on ABC Radio. In 1974, Hundley became the first radio and television voice of the expansion New Orleans Jazz. He followed them to Salt Lake City in 1979, where he became as celebrated a broadcaster as he was a player. He was known for his rapid-fire style and sayings such as \\"from the parking lot\\" for a long-distance shot, or \\"with a gentle push and a mild arc and the old cowhide globe hits home\\" for a jump shot. For many years, Hundley's broadcasts were simulcast on both television and radio, but the league forced the Jazz to end this practice starting with the 2005–2006 season, when Craig Bolerjack took over television duties. Hot Rod continued to provide the radio voice for the Jazz for four more seasons. As the decade wore on, nearly all NBA teams eventually moved radio broadcasters from court-side to perches high above the court, and the strain on Hundley's surgically replaced hips and knees became too much for him to bear. He announced his retirement on April 24, 2009, effective at the end of the season.Deseret News, April 25, 2009, p. A4 After retirement, Hundley surfaced alongside Joel Meyers on KCAL's televised Lakers broadcasts as a fill-in color commentator for Stu Lantz. In 2000, Hundley graduated from WVU with a bachelor's degree, 43 years after leaving his alma mater without a degree to play in the NBA. In 1982, he was on the NCAA Silver Anniversary All- America Team for distinguished service. In 1992, he was inducted into the WVU Sports Hall of Fame. He received the NBA's Distinguished Broadcaster award in 1994. In 2003, he received the Curt Gowdy Media Award from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame – the only former professional player to achieve such an honor. In June 2004, he was voted into the Utah Broadcast Hall of Fame. He co-authored the book Hot Rod Hundley: You Gotta Love It Baby in 1998 with Tom McEachin; Bill Libby also wrote a biographical book about Hundley, Clown: No. 33 in Your Program, No. 1 in Your Heart, in 1970. A newspaper once incorrectly reported Hundley wrote a book entitled The Man With a Lot to Smile About, and other sources have persisted in repeating the error. Film appearances Hundley appeared in the 2006 movie Church Ball starring Fred Willard and Clint Howard. He had also been in talks for a movie that would have showcased his early childhood and basketball career. Personal life and death During the off-season, Hundley regularly conducted basketball clinics around the country and worked with charities in the Salt Lake City area until withdrawing from the public eye due to Alzheimer's disease in his final years. For a time, he also hosted the Hot Rod Hundley Celebrity Golf Tournament to benefit the Salt Lake Shriners Hospital. Hundley died at the age of 80 in Phoenix, Arizona on March 27, 2015.

HPPD also catalyzes the conversion of phenylpyruvate to 2-hydroxyphenylacetate and the conversion of α-ketoisocaproate to β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate. HPPD is an enzyme that is found in nearly all aerobic forms of life. This reaction shows the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate into homogentisate by HPPD. Enzyme mechanism HPPD is categorized within a class of oxygenase enzymes that usually utilize α-ketoglutarate and diatomic oxygen to oxygenate or oxidize a target molecule. However, HPPD differs from most molecules in this class due to the fact that it does not use α-ketoglutarate, and it only utilizes two substrates while adding both atoms of diatomic oxygen into the product, homogentisate. The HPPD reaction occurs through a NIH shift and involves the oxidative decarboxylation of an α-oxo acid as well as aromatic ring hydroxylation. The NIH-shift, which has been demonstrated through isotope-labeling studies, involves migration of an alkyl group to form a more stable carbocation. The shift, accounts for the observation that C3 is bonded to C4 in 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate but to C5 in homogentisate. The predicted mechanism of HPPD can be seen in the following figure: Proposed Reaction Mechanism of HPPD  Structure  HPPD is an enzyme that usually bonds to form tetramers in bacteria and dimers in eukaryotes and has a subunit mass of 40-50 kDa. Dividing the enzyme into the N-terminus and C-terminus one will notice that the N-terminus varies in composition while the C-terminus remains relatively constant (the C-terminus in plants does differ slightly from the C-terminus in other beings). In 1999 the first X-ray crystallography structure of HPPD was created and since then it has been discovered that the active site of HPPD is composed entirely of residues near the C-terminus of the enzyme. The active site of HPPD has not been completely mapped, but it is known that the site consists of an iron ion surrounded by amino acids extending inward from beta sheets (with the exception of the C-terminal helix). While even less is known about the function of the N-terminus of the enzyme, scientists have discovered that a single amino acid change in the N-terminal region can cause the disease known as hawkinsinuria.  Function  In nearly all aerobic beings, 4- Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase is responsible for converting 4- Hydroxyphenylpyruvate into homogentisate. This conversion is one of many steps in breaking L-tyrosine into acetoacetate and fumarate. While the overall products of this cycle are used to create energy, plants and higher order eukaryotes utilize HPPD for a much more important reason. In eukaryotes, HPPD is used to regulate blood tyrosine levels, and plants utilize this enzyme to help produce the cofactors plastoquinone and tocopherol which are essential for the plant to survive.  Disease relevance  HPPD can be linked to one of the oldest known inherited metabolic disorders known as alkaptonuria, which is caused by low levels of homogentisate in the blood stream. HPPD is also directly linked to Type III tyrosinemia When the active HPPD enzyme concentration is low in the human body, it results in high levels of tyrosine concentration in the blood, which can cause mild mental retardation at birth, and degradation in vision as a patient grows older. In Type I tyrosinemia, a different enzyme, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase is mutated and doesn't work, leading to very harmful products building up in the body.National Organization for Rare Disorders. Physician’s Guide to Tyrosinemia Type 1 Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase acts on tyrosine after HPPD does, so scientists working on making herbicides in the class of HPPD inhibitors hypothesized that inhibiting HPPD and controlling tyrosine in the diet could treat this disease. A series of small clinical trials were attempted with one of their compounds, nitisinone were conducted and were successful, leading to nitisinone being brought to market as an orphan drug.  Industrial relevance  Due to HPPD’s role in producing necessary cofactors in plants, there are several marketed HPPD inhibitor herbicides that block activity of this enzyme, and research underway to find new ones.

In the United States after accumulating enough sea time in a qualified rating, taking required training courses, and completing on-board assessments, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a license as a Third Mate or Third Assistant Engineer. If approved, the applicant must then pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. The U.S. military rough equivalent to this term is mustang. A ship's hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. This is in turn derived from the traditional British Naval usage of \\"came up through the hawsehole\\", referring to sailors who first entered the ship as foremast jacks before becoming officers, metaphorically by climbing up the hawser rather than being received directly onto the quarterdeck. There is also the phrase, \\"going down the hawse pipe\\" which refers to an officer who cannot find a ship's billet and signs on as an ordinary seaman or wiper. Several merchant seamen's unions offer their members the required training to help them advance, and some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner must pay the cost of the required training. Since the requirements of STCW '95 were enacted there have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult because of the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. Critics said that the newer requirements would eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.

He served as Minister of War in the government of Antonio López de Santa Anna in 1833 and 1834, then as president of Mexico from 28 January 1835 to 27 February 1836. He remains the youngest president of Mexico to have died of natural causes. Career  The War of Independence and the First Empire  Barragán fought with Ejército Trigarante in the Mexican War of Independence, rising to the rank of brigadier general. After independence, he joined a conspiracy against Emperor Agustín de Iturbide with other ex-insurgents. They met in the house of Miguel Domínguez, ex- corregidor of Querétaro. The conspirators wrote to Pedro Celestino Negrete in Guadalajara, expecting support. Instead, he denounced the conspiracy to Iturbide. Seventeen people were arrested, including Guadalupe Victoria, Brigadier Nicolás Bravo and Barragán. Barragán was not freed until after the fall of the empire. On 20 June 1824, he was named commanding general of Veracruz, which was under bombardment from the Spanish in the fort of San Juan de Ulúa, the only position the Spanish still held in Mexico. Barragán blockaded the fort with two small ships. The Spanish garrison was suffering from hunger and illness. The Spanish commander, José María Coppinger, surrendered on 6 November 1825, under a pact of 14 articles. The pact was ratified on 18 November, and Barragán occupied Ulúa on that day. All of Mexico was now free of Spanish control. In recognition of the results, Congress named Barragán political chief of the state of Veracruz in 1828. First Mexican Republic  He was compromised in the 1827 Plan de Montaño, an armed uprising against President Guadalupe Victoria that aimed to prohibit secret Masonic lodge meetings of the Yorkinos and force the expulsion of Joel Roberts Poinsett, the diplomatic representative of the United States, who meddled in Mexican politics in the side of liberals. Colonel José Rincón, under Barragán's command in Veracruz, denounced the conspirators. Barragán was arrested at the hacienda of Santa Anna and confined in the jail formerly used by the Inquisition. Generals Guadalupe Victoria and Vicente Guerrero intervened on his behalf, and he was sentenced only to temporary exile. He lived in Ecuador, Guatemala and the United States. Called back to Mexico by Santa Anna, he was Minister of War from 20 November 1833 to 13 February 1834 in the governments of Santa Anna and Valentín Gómez Farías. (He was a political supporter of Santa Anna.) During this period, Barragán and Quintanar were sent to suppress rebels in the state of Jalisco.  President of the Centralist Republic of Mexico  On 28 January 1835, Barragán replaced Santa Anna in the presidency on an interim basis. Legally, Santa Anna had to give up the presidency while he was acting as commander in chief of the armed forces. Barragán took measures to help widows and poor people, partly out of his own pocket. He also suppressed an anti-Santa Anna revolt in the current state of Guerrero. He served until 27 February 1836, when he resigned because of a grave illness. He died in the National Palace on 1 March 1836, a victim of a \\"putrid fever\\" (probably typhus). He was interred in the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral, and his name was inscribed in letters of gold in the chamber where Congress met. José Justo Corro succeeded him in office.

It was released in November 1978 by Passport Records in the United States, and in April 1979 by Arista Records in the United Kingdom. Unlike his previous two releases, the album is a collection of demos, out-takes, and previously unreleased material rather than an explicit attempt at a commercial album. Private Parts & Pieces received a limited edition with 5,000 copies sold as an accompaniment to his next studio release, Sides (1979). The success of the album's format inspired Phillips to continue with the series, and put out the second instalment, Private Parts & Pieces II: Back to the Pavilion, in 1980. Background and recording In early 1978, Phillips secured a three-album record deal with Arista Records which allowed for the UK release of his second studio album Wise After the Event (1978) in May of that year. He then started work on his next album which took a different direction than his previous two in regards to its content, as rather than making a conscious attempt at a produced and fully arranged album, he assembled pieces of acoustic music that he had written and recorded but remained unreleased. The main reason for the album was that Phillips had learned from his manager Tony Smith that musician and producer Brian Eno had formed a record label primarily focused on instrumental music. However, Phillips recalled that the label was disinterested in the tracks as it wanted to feature more ambient and synthesised music. The idea was discarded until Phillips was making his fourth studio album Sides (1979) when Arista Records agreed to package the first 5,000 copies of Sides with Private Parts & Pieces as a free accompaniment. Phillips felt particularly lucky with Arista agreeing to put out the album as he deemed it \\"the best of the home recordings\\" with tracks that were \\"simple, a bit rough at the edges\\" with substandard presentation but were strong in character and emotion. Whereas before Phillips gave reasons why not to include a track on an album he was making, producing Private Parts & Pieces made the excuses no longer matter. The songs on Private Parts & Pieces were recorded between 1972 and 1976 at Send Barns, a recording facility set-up at the home of Phillips's parents in Woking, Surrey. He is credited as the album's co-producer with duties also completed by Harry Williamson. The earliest pieces were put down on a Revox 2-track tape machine before Phillips installed a TEAC 4-track with added Dolby noise reduction. The 12-string guitar played on the album was built by Rivers Jobe, one of Phillips's former school bandmates in Anon. In a 2014 interview, Phillips revealed that a radio broadcast can be heard in the background in the opening of one of the album's tracks. After completing the initial mixes himself, problems arose when Phillips handed the completed tracks to Ray Staff for mastering at London's Trident Studios as his inexperience had caused numerous technical errors which Staff had to correct. The album's artwork was designed and illustrated by artist Peter Cross, who depicted a soldier going off to war in the winter and returning home during a summer. Phillips had high praise for Cross's design, rating it among his best. Music \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is a piano piece that was recorded in 1972, the first of two pieces on the album recorded that year, and inspired upon Phillips hearing one of Chopin's piano nocturnes. It features Phillips on piano, a pin piano, an acoustic classical guitar. Phillips noted the track was recorded in four hours, and developed at a time when he experimented his technique such as playing at different speeds. It was recorded in \\"fake stereo\\" as he flipped from one track to another during the piece, resulting in the two tracks running slightly out of sync, but it ended up \\"too fast not to matter\\". \\"Field of Eternity\\" is a classical guitar piece written in 1972, credited to Phillips and his former Genesis bandmate Mike Rutherford. It is based on what Phillips described as a \\"massive, straggly\\" composition of the same name, and contains themes from a section of \\"Flamingo\\" that was ultimately discarded and a small section of an unrecorded Genesis song from the band's early years. It was not recorded until 1976. Following the release of the Genesis Archive 1967–75 (1998) box set, it became clear that the Genesis song in question was \\"Pacidy\\". \\"Tibetan Yak- Music\\" was recorded on a 12-string guitar with unconventional tuning accompanied by what Phillips described as \\"graphics\\" from Williamson who created vocal-like effects at the end of the piece, and changed the graphic equalisation on the guitar track so it changes in timbre multiple times. Phillips described the track as \\"virtually improvised\\". It originated from sessions with Harry Williamson in early 1976 that were scheduled for a television soundtrack based on Tarka the Otter. \\"Lullaby–Old Father Time\\" is performed on four guitars: one acoustic 12-string, two acoustic 6-strings, and one electric guitar. \\"Harmonium in the Dust (or Harmonious Stratosphere)\\" features Phillips playing a harmonium and Fender Stratocaster. He did not own a synthesiser at the time of recording, so he used a harmonium as it could make a sustained note. \\"Tregenna Afternoons\\" is the second track on the album composed in 1972. It takes its name from Phillips's time at Tregenna Castle in Cornwall that overlooks St Ives Bay. Phillips wrote \\"Reaper\\" in 1970, shortly after his departure from Genesis, and wrote \\"Autumnal\\" in 1972. \\"Flamingo\\" is the first movement to a proposed 12-string guitar concerto. Release Arista released Private Parts & Pieces as an accompaniment to Phillips's next \\"full\\" studio release Sides (1979), with an initial print of 5,000 copies. Phillips originally intended to have Private Parts & Pieces as a one-off album concept, but it was enough of a success for him to continue with the series featuring tracks \\"not on large scale\\" and \\"homely\\". The second edition, Private Parts & Pieces II: Back to the Pavilion, was released in April 1980. Reissues The 1990 CD reissue of Private Parts & Pieces included two new, solo recordings of material that date from Phillips' time in Genesis. These songs were a new recording of \\"Stranger\\", a track from 1969, and a demo version of \\"Silver Song\\". In 2010, as part of Voiceprint's re-issue campaign of Phillips' back catalogue, the album was re-issued as a double CD with Private Parts and Pieces II: Back to the Pavilion. This release is newly remastered by Simon Heyworth, retains the two bonus tracks from the previous CD release, and adds a new bonus track, \\"Movement IV from Guitar Quintet\\", which was recorded in 1976 and had never been released. On 11 September 2015, Esoteric Recordings released a 5-disc box set containing the first four volumes in the Private Parts & Pieces series and a fifth disc of previously unreleased material.

They are often available fresh in Asia, but are more frequently found in canned or dried forms outside their nations of cultivation. Worldwide, straw mushrooms rank third in consumption, although their use in the West is somewhat uncommon and usually confined to use in Oriental cooking.  Cultivation  Straw mushrooms are grown on rice straw beds and are most commonly picked when immature (often labeled \\"unpeeled\\"), during their button or egg phase and before the veil ruptures. They are adaptable and take four to five days to mature, and are most successfully grown in subtropical climates with high annual rainfall. No record has been found of their cultivation before the 19th century.  Nutrition  One cup of straw mushrooms is nutritionally dense and provides of food energy, 27.7 µg selenium (50.36% of RDA), 699 mg sodium (46.60%), 2.6 mg iron (32.50%), 0.242 mg copper (26.89%), 69 µg vitamin B9 (Folate) (17.25%), 111 mg phosphorus (15.86%), 0.75 mg vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) (15.00%), 6.97 g protein (13.94%), 4.5 g total dietary fiber (11.84%), and 1.22 mg zinc (11.09%).  Identification  In their button stage, straw mushrooms resemble poisonous death caps, but can be distinguished by several mycological features, including their pink spore print (spore prints of death caps are white). The two mushrooms have different distributions, with the death cap generally not found where the straw mushroom grows natively, but immigrants, particularly those from Southeast Asia to California and Australia, have been poisoned due to misidentification.

He served as president of Mexico in late 1841 for a few weeks. Early life Francisco Javier Echeverría was born to a wealthy family in Xalapa, Veracruz. In his youth he was affectionately known as \\"la naríz\\" or \\"the nose\\". He worked in his family's commercial firm until 1829 when he entered politics. He was elected a deputy in the local congress in 1829. In 1834, he moved to Mexico City, where he headed the family firm of Viuda de Echeverría e Hijos. Career National politics President Antonio López de Santa Anna named him secretary of the treasury. He served in this position from 5 May 1834 to 1 September of the same year, when he resigned over disagreements with the government of Santa Anna. Two years later he was a member of the Council of State under Anastasio Bustamante, in the latter's second term as president. Echeverría was again secretary of the treasury, still under Bustamante (27 July 1839 to 23 March 1841). This was after the Pastry War with France, and the treasury was bankrupt. His commercial firm lent 662,000 pesos to the government in copper, receiving payment in silver. He was much attacked for this in the press. He imposed a tax of 3 per 1,000 on rural and urban property and raised the consumption tax 10%. He wanted to amortize the copper coinage through an agreement with the tobacco firms. By these and other measures he greatly improved the situation of the treasury. President of Mexico On 21 September 1841, Congress named him interim president of Mexico, while Bustamante was in the field leading troops against his enemies. Echeverría held the office of president until 10 October. He left office when the Liberals returned to power. Later life He retired from politics for a time, but made his return in 1850 as a congressional deputy and was later president of the committee on prisons and also of the Academy of San Carlos. The Academy prospered under his leadership, acquiring its own building, attracting European teachers, and gaining a reputation as the best fine arts academy in America. He was founder and first director of a reformatory for young men. See also *List of heads of state of Mexico References * \\"Echeverría, Francisco Javier\\", Enciclopedia de México, v. 4.

Horwitz (born 1938) is an American legal historian and law professor at Harvard Law School. The recent past dean of Harvard Law School, Elena Kagan, relates that during her time at law school, students often nicknamed him as \\"Mort the Tort\\" since he taught the first-year subject Torts. Career Horwitz obtained an A.B. from the City College of New York (1959), an A.M. and Ph.D. from Harvard University (1962 and 1964), and an LL.B. from Harvard Law School (1967). He became an Associate Professor of Law at Harvard Law School in 1970 and gained tenure as a full professor in 1974. In 1981, he was appointed the Charles Warren Professor of American Legal History. Transformation work His first book, The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860, was published in 1977, and is widely regarded as one of the most important books in modern American legal historiography. It won the Bancroft Prize, the preeminent prize in American history in the United States. A product of its time, this book sought to give a \\"thick description\\" (à la Clifford Geertz) of the transformation of American law in the period, without appealing to \\"covering laws\\" (à la Carl Gustav Hempel). The book was conceived as an attack on the so-called \\"Consensus School\\" of American Legal History, which had dominated the field of Legal History in the 1950s and minimized the role of class dimensions in American legal history. The main argument of his book is that in the first half of the 19th century, many judges self- consciously allied themselves with a rapidly growing class of mercantile capitalists and promoted a series of legal rules which favored those capitalists. In The Transformation of American Law, 1870-1960: The Crisis of Legal Orthodoxy (1992), the sequel to his first book, Horwitz focused on the critics of the system which he described in his first book, especially Oliver Wendell Holmes, Roscoe Pound, and Karl Llewellyn. He frames this change in the law as a debate between \\"Legal Formalists\\" and \\"Legal Realists\\". He argues that in this period, the victors from his first book tried to present the current state of the law as the natural and necessary consequence of the application of the rules of reason. In their critique of Legal Formalism, the Legal Realists argued that the inductive and analogical model applied by the Legal Formalists was logically incoherent; that all law was ultimately a power relationship; and that, therefore, law was basically a form of public policy which should be decided on public policy grounds rather than by recourse to abstract categories like \\"reason\\". In 1998, Horwitz published his third book, an encomium on the Warren Court entitled The Warren Court and the Pursuit of Justice.

The report was dated October 1, 1930, but was released on October 21, 1930. The report recommended limiting Jewish immigration based on the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine. The Passfield White Paper was also dated October 1, 1930, and recommended similar limiting of Jewish immigration. Land settlement and employment The mandate and ambition of the Hope-Simpson Commission was to associate the issues of immigration, land settlement, and agricultural development in a way that would allow the government to deploy policies that could serve the country as a whole. The Report emphasized the need to develop a national water regime as the basis of the system it wished to create. Relying on this advice and on colonial experience elsewhere, the government later established a Water Board and drafted its first irrigation bill.Shamir, Ronen (2013). Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press. The commission reported the real estate price growth and availability to the Arabs: > \\"They [Jews] paid high prices for the land, and in addition they paid to > certain of the occupants of those lands a considerable amount of money which > they were not legally bound to pay.\\" > (p. 56:) \\"Actually the result of the purchase of land in Palestine by the > Jewish National Fund has been that land became extra territorial.

Not only can he never hope to lease or cultivate it, > but, by the stringent provisions of the lease of the Jewish National Fund, > he is deprived forever from employment on the land.\\" It concluded that Arab fears of the destructive impact of Zionist colonization were well-founded, and thus called for controls: > (p. 135:) \\"It is impossible to view with equanimity the extension of an > enclave in Palestine from which the Arabs are excluded. The Arab population > already regards the transfer of lands to Zionist hands with dismay and > alarm. These cannot be dismissed as baseless in light of the Zionist policy > described above.\\" Hope-Simpson emphasized that, due to the Zionist labour policy extending to all Jewish enterprises, displaced Arab farmers could not find non-agricultural employment, making the problem of unemployment among the Arabs \\"serious and widespread\\": > \\"There can be no doubt that there is at present time serious unemployment > among Arab craftsmen and among Arab laborers.\\" > \\"Arab unemployment is serious and general.\\" The Zionist contention that Arab workers benefited from Jewish immigration was therefore refuted by the report: > (p.133:) \\"The policy of the Jewish Labour Federation is successful in > impeding the employment of Arabs in Jewish colonies and in Jewish > enterprises of every kind. There is therefore no relief to be anticipated > from an extension of Jewish enterprise unless some departure from existing > practice is effected.\\" The report also addressed the hypothetical situation of \\"swollen unemployment lists\\": > \\"[A]rab unemployment is liable to be used as a political pawn.

It should not prove difficult to defeat this manoevre.\\" Immigration The report acknowledged illegal immigration both of Arabs and of Jews across the Mandate borders: > The Chief Immigration Officer has brought to notice that illicit immigration > through Syria and across the northern frontier of Palestine is material. > This question has already been discussed.
