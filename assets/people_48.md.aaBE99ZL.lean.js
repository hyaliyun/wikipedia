Origins The Tennen Rishin ryu is a traditional swordsmanship school, codified during the Kansei Era (1789‚Äì1801) by Kond≈ç Kuranosuke Nagahiro (or Nagamichi). There is limited information in regards to him: he came from T≈çt≈çmi Province (today's western Shizuoka Prefecture), but we do not know when he was born. He visited many provinces for his musha shugy≈ç, eventually becoming a member of the Kashima Shint≈ç-ry≈´. Even though he would have most likely been appointed as a teacher of this style, he left the Shint≈ç-ry≈´ aiming to create a new sword based combat system. In fact, during those years the Japanese swordsmanship gradually evolved from the rigid katageiko (form practice performed with either bokut≈ç or with dull-edged swords called habiki) towards a free practice called shinaigeiko (also known as gekiken). This kind of training allowed two practitioners to spar without the risk of severe injury thanks to bamboo swords (shinai) and armors protecting the head (men), the arm (kote), and the torso (d≈ç). With some exceptions, the popular gekiken of the second half of Edo period was quite similar to modern Kend≈ç. Kuranosuke organized all his martial arts knowledge into a new system of teaching and transmission; for this reason, even if codified during the Edo period, Tennen Rishin Ry≈´ could be listed among new schools called shin ry≈´ha. This was a breaking point between kory≈´ (old schools) and gendai bud≈ç (martial arts developed after the Meiji Restoration). He created his own school by synthesizing an actual sword fight every occasion, sticking to a fencing style whose last goal was to obtain full victory without losing composure in front of an enemy. At the end of his musha shugy≈ç Kuranosuke went to Edo. While he was establishing a d≈çj≈ç in Yagenbori he most likely went to teach in the Sagami area (today's Kanagawa Prefecture) and Tama area (western part of T≈çky≈ç). Since Tama was the birthplace of 2nd generation (Kond≈ç Sansuke), 3rd generation (Kond≈ç Sh≈´suke) and 4th generation (Kond≈ç Isami) headmasters, there is little doubt that this actually happened. Kuranosuke died in the 4th year of Bunka era (1807). The Shinsengumi ceased to exist after the 2nd year of Meiji (1869), with the end of the Boshin War and the collapse of Bakufu. It is commonly believed that the Boshin War marked the end of Tennen Rishin Ry≈´ since Kond≈ç Isami was sentenced to death and beheaded in Itabashi, Okita S≈çji died of tuberculosis, and both Inoue Genzabur≈ç and Hijikata Toshiz≈ç died in battle (the first one at Toba- fushimi and the latter in the battle of Gory≈çkaku). However, this is not historically correct. It was probably a great loss for the Shieikan d≈çj≈ç, but the tradition survived. There were many teachers of the school at that time, most of them in the Tama area. During Meiji, Taish≈ç and Sh≈çwa periods Before leaving for Ky≈çto 1863, Kond≈ç Isami adopted his older brother Miyagawa Otogor≈ç's second son, Miyagawa Y≈´gor≈ç (born in 1851). The boy was supposed to marry Tama, Kond≈ç's daughter (born in 1862) from a wedding with Matsui Tsune once the girl reached the age to be wed. Even though he did not probably receive any teaching from Kond≈ç, Y≈´gor≈ç was already practicing Tennen Rishin Ry≈´ with his real father. Miyagwa Otogor≈ç was a pupil of Tennen Rishin Ry≈´ as well, since he joined the school together with his younger brother Katsugor≈ç (the latter Kond≈ç Isami). After the death of Kond≈ç in 1868, Y≈´gor≈ç continued his training under several teachers. He probably studied with Harada Kamez≈ç (son of Harada Ch≈´ji, a disciple of Kond≈ç Sh≈´suke), despite another theory claiming that he was to become a pupil of Matsuzaki Watagor≈ç (eldest son of Matsuzaki Sh≈çsaku, student of the nidaime Sansuke). Y≈´gor≈ç eventually opened his own d≈çj≈ç in 1876 in Kami-ishihara (Ch≈çfu city), calling it Hatsuunkan. It is said that Yamaoka Tessh≈´ (1836-1888), the founder of Itt≈ç Sh≈çden Mut≈ç Ry≈´ and one of strongest swordsman of Bakumatsu and early Meiji periods, gave this name (translated as \\"the hall where the dark clouds are removed\\") upon his arrival. In 1883, Y≈´gor≈ç's first son Hisatar≈ç was born. However, his mother, Tama, died three years later in 1886. The bloodline of Kond≈ç Isamu ceased to exist when Hisatar≈ç died in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905 at the age of twenty-two. Y≈´gor≈ç was remarried with a woman from Kokubunji city, called Tayo. From this union Kond≈ç Shinkichi was born. Kond≈ç Y≈´gor≈ç eventually divorced from his new wife because she had a bad relationship with Matsui Tsune, the wife of Kond≈ç Isamu and mother of Y≈´gor≈ç‚Äôs wife Tama. The third and the last marriage the godaime contracted was with a girl name Kashi. Kond≈ç Y≈´gor≈ç died in 1933, aged 83. Under his direction, the Hatsuunkan greatly flourished, gathering thousands of practitioners in the Tama area. At the beginning of Sh≈çwa period he was interviewed by Shimozawa Kan (1892‚Äì1968), a writer whose Shinsengumi related books would go to inspire an entire literature genre in regards to the swordsmen corps. In fact, a large portion of Tennen Rishin Ry≈´'s fame was due to jidai sh≈çsetsu (historical novels). The best disciple of Kond≈ç Y≈´gor≈ç, Sakurai Kinpachi, inherited the title of 6th generation headmaster when his teacher was still alive. However, in 1932, he was forced to leave the school since he moved to Hokkaid≈ç. The school's fate was then passed to Y≈´gor≈ç's son, Shinkichi, who became the 7th generation headmaster (nanadaime). Shinkichi also served as a Kend≈ç assistant teacher (joshu) for the Keishich≈ç, the police department. Kond≈ç Shinkichi died in his early forties during 1936. Afterwards, the Kond≈ç line was left without guidance for several years until a new pupil, named Kat≈ç Isuke (student of Y≈´gor≈ç and Shinkichi), returned from the war to claim the position of headmaster.

The project, starting in February 1992, was conceived in collaboration between Apple Computer, who provided the majority of engineers, and Novell, who at the time was one of the leaders of cross-platform file- servers. The plan was that Novell would market the resulting OS as a challenge to Microsoft Windows, but the project was discontinued in 1993 and never released, although components were reused in other projects. The project was named after the Star Trek science fiction franchise with the slogan \\"To boldly go where no Mac has gone before\\". History The impetus for the creation of the Star Trek project began out of Novell's desire to increase its competition against the monopoly of Microsoft and its DOS-based Windows products. While Microsoft was eventually convicted many years later of illegal monopoly status, Novell had called Microsoft's presence \\"predatory\\" and the US Department of Justice had called it \\"exclusionary\\" and \\"unlawful\\". Novell's first idea to extend its desktop presence with a graphical computing environment was to adapt Digital Research's GEM desktop environment, but Novell's legal department rejected this due to apprehension of a possible legal response from Apple, so the company went directly to Apple. With shared concerns in the anti-competitive marketplace, Intel's CEO Andy Grove supported the two companies in launching their joint project Star Trek on February 14, 1992 (Valentine's Day). Apple set a deadline of October 31, 1992 (Halloween Day), promising the engineering team members a performance bonus of a large cash award and a vacation in Cancun, Mexico. Of the project, team member Fred Monroe later reflected, \\"We worked like dogs. It was some of the most fun I‚Äôve had working\\". Achieving their deadline goal and receiving their bonuses, the developers eventually reached a point where they could boot an Intel 486 PC (with very specific hardware) into System 7.1, and its on-screen appearance was indistinguishable from a Mac. However, every program would then need to be ported to the new x86 architecture to run. It was supposed that programs could be ported with little effort because Apple developed equivalent headers for x86. The tagline for the project was \\"to boldly go where no Mac has gone before,\\" which Computerworld mocked with the comment \\"the OS that boldly goes where everyone else has been\\". However, the project was canceled in mid-1993 because of political infighting, personnel issues, and the questionable marketability of such a project. Apple's side of the project had seen the exit of a supportive CEO, John Sculley, in favor of a new CEO, Michael Spindler. Spindler was not interested in the project, instead reallocating most software engineering resources toward the company's total migration to the competing PowerPC architecture. No Macintosh operating system launched natively on Intel hardware until the official transition of Mac OS X in 2006. Architecture Star Trek was designed as a hybrid of Apple's Macintosh operating system, made to run as an operating system GUI shell application upon Novell's next in- development version of the DR DOS operating system. It was designed so that a user could think of it as a standalone application platform and general computing environment, in a concept similar to Microsoft's competing Windows 3.1x, running on top of DOS. This was a radical and tedious departure both technologically and culturally, because at that time, Mac OS had only ever officially run on Apple's own computers, which were all based on the Motorola 68000 architecture. The system was built on the successor of Digital Research's DR DOS 6.0 (BDOS level 6.7 and 7.1) and NetWare PalmDOS 1.0 (code named \\"Merlin\\", BDOS level 7.0), Novell's DR DOS \\"Panther\\" as a fully PC DOS compatible 16-bit disk operating system (with genuinely DOS compatible internal data structures) for bootstrapping, media access, device drivers and file system support. The system would utilize DR DOS's new \\"Vladivar\\" Extended DOS component with flat memory support, which had been under development since 1991. \\"Vladivar\\" (\`DEVICE=KRNL386.SYS\` aka \`DEVICE=EMM386.EXE /MULTI\` \\\\+ \`TASKMGR\`) was a dynamically loadable 32-bit protected mode system core for advanced memory management, hardware virtualization, scheduling and domain management for pre-emptive multithreading within applications as well as multitasking of independent applications running in different virtual DOS machines (comparable to Windows 386 Enhanced Mode but without a GUI). Thereby, the previously loaded DOS environment including all its device drivers became part of the system domain under the multitasker. Unless specific protected mode virtual device drivers were loaded, hardware access got tunneled through this 16-bit sub-system by default. For maximum speed at minimum resource footprint, the DR DOS BIOS, BDOS kernel, device drivers, memory managers and the multitasker were written in pure x86 assembly language. Apple's port of System 7.1 would run on top of this high-performance yet light-weight hybrid 32-bit/16-bit protected mode multitasking environment as a graphical system and shell in user space. Macintosh resource forks and long filenames were mapped onto the FAT12 and FAT16 file systems.  Legacy  Though the joint effort had been canceled, Novell published the long-awaited DR DOS 7.0 as Novell DOS 7 (BDOS 7.2) in 1994. Besides many other additions in the areas of advanced memory and disk management and networking, Novell DOS 7 provided all of Novell's underlying \\"STDOS\\" components of the DR DOS Panther and Vladivar projects except for the graphical Star Trek component itself, which had been jointly developed by Apple and Novell. Instead, TASKMGR provides a text mode interface to the underlying multitasker in EMM386, but the system also provides an API to allow third-party GUIs to take control. Microsoft Windows, ViewMAX 2 and 3, and PC/GEOS / NewDeal are known to utilize this interface, when run on Novell DOS 7 (or its successors OpenDOS 7.01 or DR-DOS 7.02 and higher), and Star Trek would have been yet another one. In fact, some additional hooks had been implemented specifically for the Star Trek GUI for frame buffer access. These hooks have never been stripped out of EMM386 but just left undocumented. Apple reused some of the platform abstraction technology developed for Star Trek, incorporating it into the concurrently developedand which some consider competingmigration to the PowerPC architecture. This abstraction technology includes the capability of loading the Mac OS ROM data from a file instead of from a ROM chip. Former Star Trek team members Fred Monroe and Fred Huxham formed the company Fredlabs, Inc. In January 1997, the company released VirtualMac, a Mac OS application compatibility virtual machine for BeOS. Similar concepts =Within Apple= Apple's first and quickly aborted concept of porting its flagship operating system to Intel systems was in 1985, following the exit of Steve Jobs. Apple did not reattempt this effort until Star Trek, and didn't launch such a product until 2006. Apple has actually shipped products based upon the concept of hybridizing Mac OS 7 into a shell application platform. It was accomplished in the form of the \`startmac\` process and other hybridized applications launched atop its UNIX-based A/UX system. It was also accomplished in the form of the Macintosh Application Environment (MAE), which was the functional equivalent of Star Trek plus an embedded 68k emulator (as was the case with System 7 for Power Macintosh), running as an application for Solaris and HP/UX. Apple also delivered its \\"DOS compatible\\" models of Macs, which is a hybridized Mac with a concurrently functional Intel coprocessor card inside. Mac OS 7 and later have always had DOS filesystem compatibility. Although a direct x86 port of the classic Mac OS was never released to the public, determined users could make Apple's retail OS run upon non-Mac computers through emulation. The development of these emulation environments was said to have been inspired by the initiative shown in the Star Trek project. Two of the more popular 68k Macintosh emulators are vMac and Basilisk II, and a PowerPC Macintosh emulator is SheepShaver; each are written by third parties. Ten years after Project Star Trek, it became possible to natively run Darwin, the Unix-based core of Mac OS X, on the x86 platform by virtue of its NeXTstep foundation. This port was widely available because Darwin was open source under the Apple Public Source License. However, the Mac OS X graphical user interface, named Aqua, was proprietary. It was not included with Darwin, which depended on other window managers running on X11 for graphical interfaces, and thus most commercial Mac OS applications cannot run natively on Darwin alone. Apple ran a similar project to Star Trek for Mac OS X, called Marklar, later referred to by Steve Jobs as having been the \\"secret double life\\" of the publicly Power PC-only Mac OS. This project was to retain OPENSTEP's x86 port, keeping Mac OS X and all supporting applications (including iLife and Xcode) running on the x86 architecture as well as that of the PowerPC. Marklar was publicly revealed by Apple's CEO Steve Jobs in June 2005 when he announced the Macintosh transition to Intel processors starting in 2006. =Within IBM= Comparing and contrasting with Apple's efforts, IBM had long since attempted a different strategy to provide the same essential goal of innovating a new software platform upon commodity hardware, while nondestructively preserving existing legacy installations of MS-DOS heritage. However, its strategy was based upon its OS/2 operating system, which had long since achieved seamless backward compatibility with MS-DOS applications. In 1992, roughly coinciding with the timeframe of the Star Trek project, IBM devised a new and fundamentally integral subsystem for backward compatibility with Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1 applications. This new subsystem for OS/2, called Win-OS/2, was integrated beginning with OS/2 2.0. Although conceived through different legacy business requirements and cultures, Win-OS/2 was designed with similar software engineering objectives and virtualization techniques as was Star Trek. Coincidentally, IBM had also code-named its OS/2 releases with Star Trek themes, and would eventually make such references integral to OS/2's public brand beginning with OS/2 Warp. Apple and IBM have attempted several proprietary cross-platform collaborations, including the unreleased port of QuickTime to OS/2, the significant traction of the OpenDoc software framework, the AIM alliance, Kaleida Labs, and Taligent. Both companies have utilized actual personnel from the Star Trek television and movie franchise for promotional purposes. =Others= A corporation formerly known as ARDI developed a product called Executor, which can run a compatible selection of 68k Macintosh applications, and is hosted upon either the DOS or Linux operating systems on an Intel CPU. Executor is a cleanroom reimplementation of the Macintosh Toolbox and versions 6 and 7 of the operating system, and an integrated 68k CPU emulator called Syn68k. Liken from Andataco, for Sun and HP workstations, emulates the Macintosh hardware environment including the 68k CPU, upon which the user must install System 6.0.7. Quorum Software Systems made two apps targeting UNIX workstations: Equal provides binary compatibility by emulating the Mac APIs and 68k CPU, to put each precertified Mac app into its own X window, on Sun and SGI workstations; Latitude provides a source code porting layer with a Display Postscript driver.

The incident Abdo, then reportedly aged 16, approached the checkpoint running towards the soldiers, wearing 8 Kilograms (18 lbs) of explosives on a vest with the activation switch in his hands. When the Israeli soldiers noticed something suspicious about the boy, they directed their weapons at him and he became startled and raised his arms without detonating the belt. He was then ordered to raise his shirt and the explosives belt was discovered. After all the people were ordered to safety, a specialized Bomb disposal robot was sent to him with a pair of scissors, so that he could cut off the explosives, all the while telling soldiers that he did not want to die. He was then searched for more bombs but none were found and the bomb taken from Abdo's vest was later exploded at a safe area. The commanding officer at the checkpoint noted that it is possible that the boy tried to activate the explosive belt but that \\"it did not work\\". Media reported that Abdo said he was offered 100 NIS and promised sex with the promised virgins and Israeli security forces added that in the inquiry it was found that Abdo was unpopular among his fellow students and that his friends would mock him. Fatah's military wing of Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades from the Balata refugee camp in Nablus took responsibility for the sending of the boy.'\\"Explosives boy\\" to the soldiers: I came to explode because they offered sex' by Efrat Weiss (Ynet) When asked on Israeli television to give the reason for his attempted attack, Abdo said \\"because of the people\\". When this was repeated back to him in the form of a question, he responded, \\"they don't love me\\". He was then asked by a reporter if he also thought about paradise, and nodded his head.'Israeli TV - 14 year old Suicide Bomber' by Channel 2 (video) The Jerusalem Post quoted Hussam as saying his handlers told him that blowing himself up is the only chance he'd have at sex with 72 virgins in the Garden of Eden. The Age reported that Hussam said, in an interview, that after years of bullying by classmates, he wanted to reach the paradise he had learned about in Islamic teachings. Interviews In July 2004, the BBC was allowed an interview with Abdo in an Israeli jail in which he detailed the trail of mission. He said he was recruited by his friend Nasser, a 16-year-old classmate who approached him asking Abdo if he would find him a \\"martyr bomber\\", to which Abdo replied he'll do it. Abdo was then taken to Wael, a 21-year-old member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades who took him to a third militant who put the bomb belt on the boy and both took pictures of him. Abdo described his feelings towards the people who sent him as 'normal' and noted that one of them is also in prison and that they are friends. When asked about the reasons for the attack, Abdo stated it was because his friend was killed and also because he desired to be relieved of school. In the documentary The Making of a Martyr, Abdo was interviewed a year and a half after his attempted suicide bombing. He expressed no remorse and in fact seemed closer to the terrorists with whom he was incarcerated. He regretted not being in an explosion and remembered his failed attempt with joy, saying \\"When they drove me to the checkpoint, I was giggling and jumping.\\" Family report Abdo's mother, Tamam, said \\"He's a small child who can't even look after himself. He's only 16 . . . He never had a happy childhood. He still hasn't seen anything in life. If he was over 18, that would have been possible, and I might even encourage him to do it. But it's impossible for a child his age to do it.\\"'Hamas rejects Palestinian appeal for peace', Khaled Abutoameh (Jerusalem Post) Israeli media described Abdo as a \\"mentally challenged\\" boy while his brother, Hosni, said that Abdo \\"has the intelligence of a 12 year old.\\" His family criticized the Israeli Defense Forces for \\"parading\\" the boy in front of international reporters. Abdo's uncle Khalil said that if he found out who sent his nephew out as a suicide bomber, he'd gladly kill the dispatcher himself. Media coverage Abdo's story, and that of the child suicide bombing phenomenon in the Palestinian Territories, was captured in the award-winning documentary, The Making of A Martyr, by Brooke Goldstein and Alistair Leyland. Husam was interviewed by Pierre Rehov for making of his documentary Suicide Killers where Rehov studies the psychopathology behind Muslim terrorism, and why some Muslim parents are willing to offer their children as martyrs.CBN News - Focus- Inside the Mind of a Suicide Killer According to Shafiq Masalha, a clinical psychologist who teaches at Tel Aviv University's education program, 15% of Palestinian children dream of becoming suicide bombers.The Children's Crusade - Worldpress.org According to Eyad Sarraj, Palestinian psychiatrist and director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program, a survey his group made found that 36% of Palestinians over 12 aspired to die \\"a martyr's death\\" fighting Israel.

He attended Duke University, where he and other activists convinced the school to spend $3 million for affordable housing. He did not graduate.Buchanan, Wyatt (June 24, 2007) \\"Supervisor Daly: Conduct unbecoming a progressive?.\\" San Francisco Chronicle He moved to San Francisco in 1993, where he became involved in local politics through an advocacy group for homeless people called Mission Agenda. Daly is married to Sarah Low Daly, whom he met at the World Youth Festival in Havana, Cuba; they have two children.Editors (March 11, 2005) \\"Interview: Mrs. Chris Daly!!!.\\" SFist. Political career Daly was first elected to office in 2000 in a near sweep for progressive candidates in supervisorial races. He ran on his credentials as a housing advocate in the Mission District. Daly was re-elected in 2002 and 2006. In the three contested elections, Daly received 8,472, 6,642, and 8,968 votes respectively.City and County of San Francisco, election results 2000 . SFGOV.org.City and County of San Francisco, election results 2002 . SFGOV.org.City and County of San Francisco, election results 2006 . SFGOV.org. =Housing and homelessness= Daly's legislative record focused primarily on housing and homelessness. He sponsored legislation to help low-income tenants of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residential hotels, many of whom were located in his district. In 2005, Daly negotiated a planned development on Rincon Hill, where the property was rezoned to allow for highrise development in exchange for a higher percentage of affordable housing units and \\"community benefits\\" to non-profits in the area. Daly also received unanimous support for a plan to demolish and rebuild an apartment complex at Trinity Plaza in exchange for 590 affordable units. This was the first time in California history that a housing developer voluntarily allowed new construction to be covered by rent control. Critics of Daly's housing policies point to his attempt to ban tenancy-in-common apartment conversions, which they believe allow middle-income people to buy property in San Francisco. In June 2006, Daly sponsored the Eviction Disclosure Ordinance, which required real estate agents to inform buyers whether a tenant was evicted from a property they wish to purchase.Eviction Disclosure Ordinance: Proposition B. The ballot proposition won with 52 percent of the vote. In March 2007, Daly, chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee, introduced a proposal that would appropriate $28 million for affordable housing. In April 2007, Daly introduced another proposal that would appropriate an additional $15 million in services for seniors and families. Eight members of the Board of Supervisors passed the affordable housing measure, but Mayor Gavin Newsom refused to spend the money. =Progressive convention= In June 2007, Daly organized a \\"Progressive Convention\\" to find a candidate to run against popular Mayor Gavin Newsom.Vega, Cecilia (May 15, 2007) \\"Convention date set, but still no candidate.\\". San Francisco Chronicle. Daly stated that if the convention could not choose a candidate, he himself would run. But when the Progressive Convention did not nominate anyone, Daly declined to run himself. He said that he wanted to spend time with his family and that his wife was due to give birth shortly before the mayoral election.Vega, Cecilia (June 5, 2007) \\"Chris Daly also isn't running for mayor.\\" San Francisco Chronicle.Hogarth, Paul (June 4, 2007) \\"If Daly Doesn't File Today, Convention Paved Way for Gonzalez.\\" \\"Beyond Chron.\\" =Elimination of Police Chief post= Daly suggested putting a charter amendment before voters in the November 2007 municipal election calling for elimination of the police chief post. Instead, the elected sheriff would oversee all law enforcement in the city and county of San Francisco. The suggestion arose from Daly's disagreements with Police Chief Heather Fong about the placement and use of police patrols. \\"If they keep the attacks on me, I'll keep moving forward what I think is good public policy,\\" Daly said. \\"What they fear is the end of their reign of terror in San Francisco.\\"Editors (September 20, 2006) \\"SF Supes Want to Seize Power from Police Chief.\\" KCBS online. =Opposition to the Blue Angels= In June 2007, Daly announced that he was working with anti-war activist organizations such as Code Pink, Global Exchange and Veterans for Peace and considering introducing a proposal to ban the Blue Angels from flying during San Francisco's Fleet Week. Following significant negative public response and media inquiries, Daly announced that he had decided against making this proposal, blaming reporters at the San Francisco Examiner for his inability to move forward with this controversial proposal.Wyatt Buchanan (September 11, 2007) \\"Blue Angels ban fails again\\" SF Gate =Removal from Budget Committee chairmanship= On June 15, 2007, Board President Aaron Peskin removed Daly as chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee shortly before it was to finalize the $6.06 billion budget proposed by Mayor Gavin Newsom. Explaining why he removed Daly, Peskin cited Daly's bitter public conflict with the mayor over budget priorities. \\"Fundamentally,\\" he said, \\"the budget process is about public policy and not about personality and it is important that we stay committed to having an outcome that ensures we have a budget that reflects the values of the people of San Francisco.\\" =Canceling of the San Francisco Grand Prix= Daly, along with Aaron Peskin, was instrumental in the canceling of the San Francisco Grand Prix, a world-class bicycle race held from 2001 to 2005, because of disagreements over the amount to be paid for traffic and crowd control and because the race's backers owed the city $89,924. In 2001 Mayor Willie Brown, who supported the race, allowed its organizers to incur a $350,000 debt and later ordered city officials to forgive that debt. Critics alleged that the race was canceled for political reasons including pressure from Peskin's constituents over parking issues. In Daly's personal blog, he referred to one of the chief backers of the race, San Francisco banker Thom Weisel, as a \\"multi-millionaire Republican politico\\". The race, which was organized as a 1.HC event and in 2005 was part of the UCI America Tour attracted hundreds of thousands of spectators as well as world-class athletes such as seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, and was regarded as one of the country's most challenging, particularly for its famously difficult 18% grade Fillmore and Taylor street climbs. Mayor Gavin Newsom, who also supported the race, said it provided cultural, social, and economic benefit to San Francisco. A 2005 study commissioned by the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau found the Labor Day weekend race generated $10.2 million for city businesses that year.Smith, Matt (November 23, 2005) \\"Pedal Power: Two politicians put their interests before a world-class event and a world of possibilities.\\" SF Weekly. =Olympic torch resolution= On March 20, 2008, Daly introduced a resolution which criticized the human rights record of China and urged officials representing San Francisco during the upcoming Olympic torch ceremonies (scheduled for April 9, 2008) to \\"make publicly known that the 2008 Summer Games torch is received with alarm and protest.\\" Daly's resolution was covered extensively by the local media and elevated the issues of treatment of protests in relation to the Olympics being held in China, the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and the torch ceremonies being held in San Francisco, the only North American stop. The torch relay will be the first time in Olympics history that protests will accompany the torch as it passes through a U.S. city. Daly stated, \\"[T]he magnitude of attention paid to the Olympic Games and the torch relay makes the event the appropriate platform to discuss human rights. If someone can look you in the face and tell you the Olympics are limited to the individual competitions that take place, well, that's a good poker player.\\" Daly also criticized the rare decision to set up designated \\"free-speech zones\\" stating, \\"I don't see why we should break from our pattern of how we handle mass protests or demonstrations for China.\\" San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, said he has \\"very serious concerns\\" about the situation in Tibet but added San Francisco is \\"privileged\\" to be the torch's only stop in North America and that the event should rise above political concerns and that the Games should be a time \\"to focus on the things that unite us and not divide us.\\" In a later committee meeting supervisors Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd amended the resolution to welcome the Global Human Rights Torch Relay on April 5 and the Tibetan Freedom Torch on April 8 and commend \\"their efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations in China and urging the San Francisco City Representatives ... to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of Olympism, consistent with the United Nations Charter ... and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\"Board of Supervisors Supes Committee Waters Down Resolution Critiquing Human Rights In China - News Story - KTVU San Francisco =Appointments to Public Utilities Commission = On October 22, 2003, during his one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown traveled to Tibet, Daly appointed two members to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown's consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown's absence.Gordon, Rachel (November 13, 2003) \\"Brown cries political foul: He calls Daly's move to make PUC appointments unethical.\\" \\"San Francisco Chronicle.\\" Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that \\"[The appointments] were made by a person who was supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... [It was] a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, long before I became mayor of this city.\\" Brown also compared Daly to a stalker and suicide bomber, stating that, \\"When you conspire and calculate what you intend to do several days before you're designated as the acting mayor, you really are venal, you really are violative of all the protocols. It's like stalking. You knew exactly what you were intending to do. You concealed all your steps. You carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you laughed about it.\\" Brown said he found out about Daly's actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China‚Äîreportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a \\"coup.\\" Nonetheless, the City Attorney stood behind its legal opinion and environmentalist and former Sierra Club president Adam Werbach was later sworn in. The second appointee, architect Robin Chiang, was rescinded because Brown had already made one appointment, Andrew Lee, son of one of Brown's fund- raiser Julie Lee, who was convicted of mail fraud and witness tampering on July 12, 2008.Article: Julie Lee convicted of fraud Daly and his allies on the board said Andrew Lee represented political patronage at its worst.Conservationists applaud PUC additions / City Hall power grab installs a Sierra Club son According to John Rizzo, vice chairman of the Bay chapter of the Sierra Club, Daly's appointments would add \\"expertise to the SFPUC that was greatly lacking and is a great improvement\\" Brown said that Daly's action went beyond betrayal and that he considers his relationship with Daly, who he had praised in recent months, over. The custom of assigning the acting mayor position to supervisors on a round-robin basis was discontinued as a result of Daly's appointments. Daly said by way of explanation for his actions, \\"I'm an activist. I had an opportunity, and I took it. I stand by what I did. It was the right thing.\\" Gordon, Rachel (November 13, 2003) \\"Brown cries political foul: He calls Daly's move to make PUC appointments unethical.\\" San Francisco Chronicle.\\" =Controversies= Daly has a reputation for having a fiery demeanor. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Daly is \\"either a hothead or a passionate advocate--depending on whose side you are on.\\"Gordon, Rachel (November 24, 2004) \\"Daly scolded -- but not censured: Supervisors reject formal action over his use of profanity. San Francisco Chronicle. In 2001, Daly nearly came to blows with Mayor Willie Brown after Daly brought homeless activists to a meeting that was supposed to be \\"private.\\" Asked to apologize, Daly replied, \\"I will apologize that I was lured into the mayor's finger- pointing politics.\\"Smith, Matt (February 9, 2005) Cuss and Conquer: A more polite, nuanced approach might prove more effective for Supervisor Chris Daly. Or not. SF Weekly. In November 2004, fellow supervisor Michela Alioto-Pier lodged a petition for censure against Daly after he told a landlord advocate to \\"fuck off\\" at a tenants' rights hearing (the petition failed by a vote of 8-2). In 2001, Daly famously told his colleagues at a Supervisors' meeting, \\"I'm not feeling the love,\\" when they rejected his proposals for balancing the budget, as he stormed out of the room. In 2002, Daly was arrested after a confrontation with police over a land use dispute concerning Hastings Law School, and reportedly told the arresting officer that he would have him fired; no charges were filed.Koopman, John (June 8, 2002) \\"Supervisor clashes with S.F. police.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. In June 2007, after learning that an attempted budget maneuver would be unsuccessful, Daly, according to San Francisco Chronicle columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross, \\"went ballistic -- singling out fellow progressive leader Ross Mirkarimi for a tongue lashing so heated that fellow supervisors joked about calling in the SWAT team to cool things down\\". On June 19, 2007, during a Board of Supervisors meeting, Daly suggested that Mayor Gavin Newsom uses cocaine and is a hypocrite for proposing public health cuts for substance abuse treatment for the poor. Daly stated that it was ironic of Newsom to propose cuts to a drug treatment program, \\"while the mayor of San Francisco artfully dodges every question about allegations of his own cocaine use.\\" The mayor's press secretary said Daly's remarks were \\"sleazy politics of personal destruction.\\" The Board of Supervisors President stated that \\"Supervisor Daly's comments were conduct unbecoming and do not represent the position of the Board of Supervisors or its president.\\" The editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle recommended censuring Daly. During an August 7, 2008, Rules Committee hearing after Daly had presented his resolution to turn the San Francisco Zoo into a rescue facility and when he was out of the room, a student from Lowell High School who had waited two hours for her chance to speak in support of the zoo, began to cry at the podium, because she, like the other speakers, was only allowed one minute to speak. Normally at Board of Supervisors hearings, speakers have 2-3 minutes to speak, but time is limited by the discretion of the chair often to shorter periods of time, especially if there are a large number of speakers. This was the second time the item had been heard in committee, and Chris Daly chose to limit public comment to one minute, so that another item regarding black flight from the City could be heard at that same hearing. video of the hearing in question. Carl Friedman, the Director of the San Francisco Department of Animal Care and Control, said, \\"There were a lot of young people there who have never been to a government meeting. For this to be their first experience was embarrassing.\\" When asked about the situation, the student responded, \\"I didn't mean to cry, I just kind of lost it. I thought they were supposed to listen to us.\\" On April 21, 2009, at a Democratic Party fundraising lunch, members of the Building and Construction Trades Council called on Party Chairman Aaron Peskin and Daly to resign over their support for the voter-approved Historic Preservation Commission.Knight, Heather (April 21, 2009) \\"Would you like a picket line with your Cobb salad?\\" San Francisco Chronicle. (Retrieved 4-3-13).) In 2009, questions began to arise whether Chris Daly actually lived in San Francisco. He purchased a home in Fairfield, California, and sent his family to live there. San Francisco law requires supervisors to live in the district which they represent. .Wachs, Benjamin (July 29, 2009) \\"Why Supervisor Chris Daly shipped his family off to Fairfield \\" San Francisco Weekly. (Retrieved 7-29-2009).) On January 8, 2010, Daly announced to the Board of Supervisors' Rules Committee, \\"I vow to use the word fuck in each of my remaining Board of Supervisors meetings.\\" On July 27, 2010 Daly called for at least 50 percent of proposed new Hunters Point housing be affordable. He stated that although it would be impossible for Lennar (the project's Miami-based developer) to meet this expanded affordability requirement, that nevertheless shouldn't be a concern. If the project becomes too expensive for local residents to move in, \\"there's going to be a pretty new neighborhood, with lots of white folks living in the Bayview,\\" Daly said. Michael Cohen, head of the mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development, stated that Daly's amendment was a deal-killer, because \\"the project is not financially viable at 50 percent affordable.\\" Susan King, a past spokesperson for San Francisco's Green Party, said about Daly, \\"At the end of the day, I totally appreciate the fact that he is out there in the trenches. It's not 100 percent that I agree with him, but you know where his heart is and where his values are.\\" Nathan Nayman, executive director of the Committee on Jobs (a pro-business PAC that receives contributions from corporate donors and promotes economic development Ethics Committee Report that its advocacy fund is \\"to support candidates who support economic development.\\" ), said \\"Chris Daly has given the Board of Supervisors a black eye that refuses to heal. He's maniacal and he's been given to outbursts on a regular basis.\\" The San Francisco Bay Guardian says that \\"Daly's a hard worker, has a solid record,...is popular in his district,...is more than a good supervisor.... He's part of the class of 2000, one of a crew of activists who swept into power in the first district elections as a rebellion against the developer-driven politics of then-mayor Willie Brown.\\" http://www.sfbayguardian.com/entry.php?entry_id=1926&catid;=4&volume;_id=254&issue;_id=258&volume;_num=41&issue;_num=04 The Berkeley Planet said \\"Chris Daly [has] a strong progressive record in [his] legislative bod[y],... first elected because [he] engaged [his] district's most disenfranchised population.\\"http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2006-11-03/article/25508 Post-electoral career After leaving the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Daly moved to Fairfield, California.

He is principally known for his spectacular colour images of astronomical objects. A galaxy is named after him, Malin 1, which he discovered in 1986 and which is the largest spiral galaxy so far discovered. Career Malin was born in 1941 and raised in Heywood, Greater Manchester, in the north of England. He was trained as a chemist and originally worked as a microscopist. In 1975 he moved to Sydney to take up a job with the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO), now the Australian Astronomical Observatory. Whilst working at the AAO, Malin developed several photographic processing techniques to maximise the ability to extract faint and low contrast detail from the non-linear response and high densities of photographic plates. These techniques were initially devised to enhance the scientific return from photography, but Malin is now best known for the series of three-colour wide field images of deep space objects which have been widely published as posters and in books around the world. Most professional astronomical photographs are monochromatic; if colour pictures are required, three images are needed. During his career at the AAO, Malin made about 150 three-colour images of deep sky objects, mostly using plates taken with the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the UK Schmidt Telescope. The true-colour images are assembled from three separate monochromatic photographs taken through red, green and blue filters. Each photographic plate is a special black and white emulsion designed for low light conditions and is further enhanced for low light sensitivity by baking in a nitrogen and hydrogen atmosphere. The exposure times are relatively long, varying between 5‚Äì60 minutes for each colour, depending on the luminosity of the object. The colour image is re-assembled in the darkroom, where further techniques such as unsharp masking to enhance fine detail might also be applied. In 1986 he discovered Malin 1, a giant spiral galaxy located away in the constellation Coma Berenices, near the North Galactic Pole. it is the largest spiral galaxy so far discovered, with an approximate diameter of . Since the early 1990s, silver-based astrophotography has been largely superseded by digital sensors, but many of the technical advances Malin introduced to the field have been carried over to processing astrophotography on computers. Malin has published over 250 academic papers on the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and ten books. In 2001 he retired from the AAO to concentrate on his own business, David Malin Images, which manages his image collection along with those of related photographers.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Hugh Morrus and World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) under his real name. DeMott also performed as Crash the Terminator in both Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and Japan. Generally used as a jobber to the stars in WCW, he attained championship success during the promotion's dying days in late 2000 and early 2001, holding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship twice. After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company's Tough Enough program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE's developmental territories Deep South Wrestling, Florida Championship Wrestling, and NXT; after working for WWE a total of 10 years between 2001 and 2015, he resigned from the company amid allegations of severe misconduct from over a dozen former trainees, including verbal and physical assault. Early life William Charles DeMott II was born on November 10, 1966, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. He grew up in Paramus, New Jersey, graduating from Paramus High School in 1983.Levine, Cecilia. \\"Paramus Pro Wrestler Who Lost Daughter Has New Purpose: 'End Drunk Driving'\\", Paramus Daily Voice, October 21, 2017. Accessed November 18, 2017. \\"Oct. 10, 2015 was the day life both stopped and started for Paramus native Bill DeMott.... DeMott graduated from Paramus High School in 1983, and went on to become a pro wrestler, earning himself the title of world heavyweight champion, and more.\\" Professional wrestling career =Early career (1988‚Äì1994)= DeMott was trained by Johnny Rodz in his New York City wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the Americas Wrestling Federation and started using the name Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF World Heavyweight Title from Steve Strong in Puerto Rico, before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with Mr. Pogo. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion. When DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for Extreme Championship Wrestling for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the World Wrestling Federation at a Monday Night Raw taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling and Wrestling Challenge.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where he won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a battle royal. Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7. =World Championship Wrestling (1995‚Äì2001)= The Dungeon of Doom and The First Family (1995‚Äì2000) In 1995, DeMott was signed to a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) contract at the behest of Kevin Sullivan who had been impressed by him. He debuted in dark matches as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange gimmick that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of The Dungeon of Doom as \\"The Laughing Man\\" Hugh Morrus (a pun on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a vignette inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his (kayfabe) father, The Master, that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him \\"the man from the Isle of Nowhere.\\" Upon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to Bill Goldberg during the September 22, 1997 episode of Nitro. As a part of the growing hardcore wrestling style in WCW, Morrus joined Jimmy Hart's First Family stable. Although the Family found success and received a push following a victory over their rivals The Revolution, the stable was suddenly disbanded. At this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but squashing a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction. The Misfits In Action (2000‚Äì2001) After getting on Russo's bad side (in kayfabe), Morrus was fired from his New Blood stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including Chavo Guerrero, Jr. and Booker T) formed the comedic Misfits In Action stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against The Filthy Animals. The group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel Team Canada, the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and United States Heavyweight Champion Lance Storm, with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a turncoat \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan in a handicap match on October 29 at Halloween Havoc to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of Nitro before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at Mayhem. After his feud with Storm, the next night on Nitro, DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; Bill Goldberg grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said \\"Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend.\\" At Sin on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to Shane Douglas. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were honorably discharged, which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) bought out WCW. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001‚Äì2007)= The Alliance (2001‚Äì2002) When WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of The Invasion angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of The Alliance. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of Raw by attacking Edge. Aside from a pay-per-view match at Invasion on July 22 where he, Shawn Stasiak and Chris Kanyon defeated Big Show, Billy Gunn and Albert and an Intercontinental Championship match on the August 27 episode of Raw which he lost to Edge via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows Heat and Jakked much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at Survivor Series following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was kayfabe fired by Vince McMahon. While off television, Morrus performed at house shows and worked in company's developmental territory Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with Raven to defeat Lance Cade and Steve Bradley to win the Tag Team Champions on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later. SmackDown! (2002‚Äì2004) In April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of Jakked alongside fellow WCW alumnus Chavo Guerrero and defeated The Hurricane and Funaki. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on Jakked and later Velocity until late July 2002, when he was legitimately injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of Tough Enough, WWE's reality television show. When he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of Velocity under his real name. DeMott made his SmackDown! debut on December 5 as a heel, where he defeated Funaki in a squash match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a push that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, Shannon Moore, Chuck Palumbo, Crash Holly, and Rikishi weekly on SmackDown!. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to Velocity beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a face turn that also saw him tell knock-knock jokes as part of the turn. As the gimmick failed to get over, he remained on Velocity while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of Velocity, where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus Chris Kanyon. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the color commentator for Velocity, beginning on the November 1 episode, and remained in that position until December 11, 2004. Deep South Wrestling (2004‚Äì2007) When Tough Enough 4 wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to Velocity. Instead, he became a full-time trainer for WWE and began working in the company's Deep South Wrestling developmental territory. DeMott also worked as a booker for DSW, although his direction in the promotion received criticism, most notably by former WWE developmental wrestler Kenny Omega, who soon requested to be released from his developmental contract due to poor treatment. DeMott was released from his WWE contract on January 19, 2007, with Tom Prichard taking his place as DSW's head trainer. In March 2015, Devon Nicholson described an incident from 2006 that DeMott was involved with while he was head trainer for the WWE's Deep South Wrestling developmental territory. Nicholson described an incident in which Drew Hankinson was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked stinkfaces to Zack Ryder and Melissa Coates while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces. The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) in order to get out of regular training for that day. DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up with because they wanted to skip the session. =Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2011)= After parting ways with WWE, DeMott competed for several independent promotions, including the Carolina Wrestling Association and the United Wrestling Federation. In addition to wrestling, he also began operating his own wrestling school called New Energy Wrestling School from 2009 to 2010 in McDonough, Georgia, while also running a brief series of wrestling events in Locust Grove, Georgia.Personal conversation; Hall, A, March 2012 =Return to WWE (2011‚Äì2015)=  Return as trainer (2011-2015)  In 2011, WWE announced that DeMott would return to the company to perform as the head trainer on the revived Tough Enough series. Following the conclusion of Tough Enough, DeMott replaced Tom Prichard as the head trainer for the Florida Championship Wrestling developmental territory on June 2, 2012. After FCW was rebranded into NXT, DeMott retained his position as the head trainer, and continued in that role when the WWE Performance Center was opened in 2013. He was featured as a trainer in the WWE 2K15 video game. DeMott resigned from the company on March 6, 2015 following multiple accusations of misconduct and abuse by a number of ex-trainees (see below), allegations which DeMott denied.  Allegations of misconduct and departure (2015)  Several former FCW, DSW, and NXT employees previously working within or with the WWE developmental system made public allegations of misconduct by DeMott during his time as trainer, including accusing DeMott of making trainees perform dangerous drills, physically assaulting and bullying trainees, using homophobic and racial slurs amongst other derogatory terms, letting trainees train while naked, and condoning sexual harassment. These allegations were made by Kevin Matthews, Mike Bucci, Ivelisse V√©lez, and Devon Nicholson in 2012, Chad Baxter and Chase Donovan in 2013, Curt Hawkins in 2014, as well as several wrestlers including Judas Devlin, Briley Pierce, Brandon Traven, Derrick Bateman and independent wrestler Terra Calaway from late February to March 2015. Devlin and Traven claimed to have submitted complaints to WWE management about DeMott in March 2013 when they were still employed with WWE, but only publicized the complaints in 2015. WWE released statements regarding some of the claims that came to light in 2013 and 2015, claiming that investigations were done and no wrongdoing was found. Pierce questioned the thoroughness of the investigations, stating that WWE did not question him despite him allegedly being one of the claimed victims. The allegations caused a negative reaction on social media in March 2015, with the #FireDeMott hashtag trending on Twitter. On March 6, 2015, DeMott publicly denied the allegations on Twitter, but also announced his resignation from WWE \\"to avoid any embarrassment or damage\\" to the company. During a May 2015 podcast with Vince Russo, V√©lez alluded that her reporting of DeMott in 2012 to the offices was likely the reason for her release from WWE shortly after. Other media DeMott voiced himself in the video game WWE 2K15. His character is a coach in the MyCareer mode.

Brahms intended the work to be more than simply a set of theme and variations; each variation also has the characteristic of a study. He published it as Studies for Pianoforte: Variations on a Theme of Paganini. The work was dedicated to the piano virtuoso Carl Tausig. It is well known for its emotional depth and technical challenges. David Dubal describes it as \\"a legend in the piano literature,\\" and \\"fiendish,\\" \\"one of the most subtly difficult works in the literature.\\" Clara Schumann called it Hexenvariationen (Witch's Variations) because of its difficulty.

The Tanimbar Islands, also called Timur Laut, are a group of about 65 islands in the Maluku province of Indonesia, including Fordata, Larat, Maru, Molu, Nuswotar, Selaru, Selu, Seira, Wotap, Wuliaru and Yamdena. The Indonesian phrase timur laut means \\"east of the sea\\" or \\"northeast\\". The Tanimbar Islands are administered as the Tanimbar Islands Regency (), a regency of Maluku. The Regency covers a land area of 4,465.79 sq.km, and it had a population of 105,341 at the 2010 Census;Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011. the latest official estimate (as of January 2014) was 117,341. The principal town and administrative centre lies at Saumlaki. Geography A building in Tanimbar Geographically, the northeast islands are still part of the Lesser Sunda Islands. The Aru Islands and Kai Islands lie to the northeast, and Babar Island and Timor lie to the west. The islands separate the Banda Sea and the Arafura Sea. The total land area of the Islands is 5440 km¬≤ (2100 sq mi). The largest of the group is Yamdena. Yamdena Island has a range of thickly forested hills along its eastern coast, while its western coast is lower. Saumlaki is the chief town, located on the south end of Yamdena. Other islands include Larat, Selaru, and Wuliaru. The population was 105, 341 at the 2010 Census, of whom about 94% are Christian, and the remainder Muslim or other. The tiny island of Tanimbarkei is not part of Tanimbar, but of the Kai Islands and inhabited by less than 1000 very traditional people. The Tanimbar Islands are part of the Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests ecoregion. History The ancestor statue from Tanimbar Islands, Western Southeast Maluku Regency In modern history, the Tanimbar islands (as the Aru Islands) were mentioned in the 16th century maps of L√°zaro Lu√≠s (1563), Bartolomeu Velho (c. 1560), Sebasti√£o Lopes (1565), in the 1594 map of the East Indies entitled Insulce Molucoe by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius, and in the map of Nova Guinea of 1600 (based on Portuguese sources). The Tanimbar Islands were sighted and possibly visited by Portuguese navigators such as Martim Afonso de Melo Jusarte around 1522‚Äì1525, who traveled around the archipelagos of Aru (with the reference \\"Here wintered Martin Afonso de Melo\\") and Tanimbar, and possibly Gomes de Sequeira in 1526.Continent of Curiosities: A Journey Through Australian Natural History - Danielle Clode, Cambridge University Press, Page 26 The Tanimbar Islands were part of the Dutch East Indies. During World War II the Dutch sent a detachment of 13 soldiers led by KNIL sergeant Julius Tahija to the town of Saumlaki in the Tanimbar Islands in July 1942. Japanese ships entered the bay at Saumlaki on 30 July and small boats were used to get to the jetty. The Japanese filed in ranks on the jetty and wanted to march in close order into Saumlaki. The garrison opened fire at close range with their two light machine guns. The Japanese retreated to their boats leaving several dead on the jetty. Subsequent enemy landings, however, were made elsewhere while the Japanese ships opened fire on the defenders‚Äô position. Six of the Dutch soldiers were killed and the survivors were driven into the bush. On 31 July, a vessel carrying an Australian Army contingent arrived at the jetty at Saumlaki, unaware that the town had fallen to the Japanese. The vessel was fired on from the shore, and the commander of the landing party was killed. The Australians retreated to Darwin. Afterwards, the members of the Dutch garrison came under naval gunfire from the Japanese; this inflicted some casualties, and was followed by attacks by Japanese infantry on a wider front. Seven surviving members of the garrison then boarded a sailing ship and escaped to Australia. Economy Important products are copra, tortoiseshell, and trepang (an edible sea cucumber). Recently, the Japanese oil and gas corporation, Inpex intended to develop the Masela Block Project with billions of tonnes of natural gas produced.

Biography Tickell was born at Cuttack in India to Lieutenant General Richard Tickell and Mary n√©e Morris. He was educated in England with a training at Addiscombe from 1827‚Äì29, returning at age nineteen to join the Bengal Native Infantry in 1829. He served in the 31st Bengal Native Infantry during the Kol campaign (1832‚Äì33). He was made commander of Brian Hodgson's military escort to Kathmandu from 1834. He returned to Bengal in 1843, and after his promotion to Captain in 1847 he was moved to Arakan, lower Burma. He applied to serve as revenue surveyor in Bhagalpur in 1848 but found himself without experience and let his assistants work on surveys while he carried out administrative duties. The survey work was ridden with errors and in 1849 he handed over charge and returned to Arakan. During his time in India, Tickell made important contributions to the country's ornithology and mammalology, with field observations and the collections of specimens. He contributed to volume 17 of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Volume 18 included a report by Tickell from Burma. He wrote under the pen-name of \\"Ornithognomon\\" and \\"Old Log\\". Hume noted that many of the notes written as \\"Ornithognomon\\" in the Field were based on observations of another amateur ornithologist, Frederic Wilson. Tickell married Maria Georgiana, daughter of J.W. Templer at Bankura on 11 July 1844. Tickell retired in 1865 and lived for a period in France before settling in the Channel Islands. In 1870, while fishing on the coast of Brittany, he suffered an eye inflammation which eventually made him blind. Tickell had been working on a seven-volume work entitled Illustrations of Indian Ornithology, but his deteriorating eyesight forced him to abandon it. Before his death he donated the unfinished work to the Zoological Society of London. These works were bound into fourteen volumes. These included one on the fishes collected in the seas and freshwaters of British Burma from 1851-64 with watercolour illustrations, a field of study which had been examined by very few fish taxonomists, the earliest work being by Francis Day; a volume on mammals (214 pages); a volume on insects, reptiles, amphibians, arachnids and crustaceans (256 pages); and the remaining volumes on birds. Of these seven volumes were titled Indian Ornithology and included 276 species illustrated of a total of 488 species described. In addition there were two volumes titled Tickell Aves with descriptions and watercolour illustrations which were based on two draft volumes of Tickell Aves MS I & II. The work showcased his excellent artistic abilities, including paintings of birds in natural habitats as well as ink vignettes showing scenes from Indian life. Tickell died in Cheltenham. A number of birds were named after Tickell, including: *Tickell's flowerpecker, Dicaeum erythrorhynchos *Tickell's leaf warbler, Phylloscopus affinis *Tickell's thrush, Turdus unicolor *Tickell's brown hornbill, Anorrhinus tickelli; and possibly one species after his wife, given the feminine or plural form (i.e. honouring the Tickell couple), though this isn't made clear in the original description: *Tickell's blue flycatcher, Cyornis tickelliae. Tickell was also interested in linguistics and wrote a series of articles on the grammatical structure of the Ho language.

The leading figure in its formation and its first leader was John Swinburne, previously a director of Motherwell Football Club. Swinburne was inspired to form the party after reading the UK government's plans for pensions in December 2002: he felt it was unfair that people might have to work longer in the future and consequently have less time to enjoy their retirement. To fight elections, the SSCUP registered with the UK Electoral Commission and under the provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the party also registered alternative names for use on ballot papers, including \\"Scottish Senior Citizens and Pensioners\\", and \\"Alliance of Scots Greys\\". On the same day the SSCUP was launched, the Scottish Pensioners Party was formed in Fife. The SSCUP made an electoral pact with this party for the Scottish Parliamentary elections, whereby they did not stand candidates against each other. Former Scottish international footballers Billy McNeill, who played for Celtic and Eric Caldow, who played for Rangers, both stood for the SSCUP in these elections. John Swinburne was the SSCUP's sole representative in the Scottish Parliament, representing Central Scotland from 2003 until 2007. Party aims and elections The party listed nine key aims on its website:Aims and Manifesto sscup.org # An index-linked basic weekly state pension of ¬£160 for all senior citizens # Remove all senior citizens from poverty in Scotland # Abolition of means-testing for senior citizens # Replace council tax with a fairer system based on ability to pay # Local authorities to set up more residential homes for senior citizens # Free nationwide travel for all senior citizens - out with peak travelling times # 50% reduction in television licences for senior citizens aged 60 to 75 # 50% reduction in vehicle excise duty for all senior citizens # Establish a Scottish Lottery, with all profits going back into the community In the 2007 Scottish Election the SSCUP lost its only seat in Holyrood, despite polling as the sixth best party and a slight increase in its vote share. However, that was possibly due to the party putting up more candidates. In 2011 their vote decreased, but they still remained the sixth placed party. The party was de-registered in 2015.

It published several games from other developers. Black Isle was based in Irvine, California. The division was formed in 1996, adopting the name \\"Black Isle Studios\\" in 1998. The idea for the division's name came from the Black Isle in Scotland - founder Feargus Urquhart's ancestral country. Black Isle Studios is most famous for working on the first two games in Fallout series as well as the critically acclaimed Planescape: Torment. They achieved success with the Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate series of role-playing video games, though they only published the Baldur's Gate series. In 1999, IGN's RPG Vault gave it the award for a Developer of the Year.1999 Vault Network Awards The company was closed in late 2003, when Interplay went bankrupt. Interplay revived the Black Isle name in August 2012 with the intention of producing new role-playing games under that label. Black Isle ceased to exist once more, without having produced any new games, when Interplay announced its intent of selling all of its video game assets and intellectual property in 2016. History Created in 1996 by Feargus Urquhart, the studio was named Black Isle after Urquhart's homeland. The studio, although credited for the creation of Fallout was, in fact, not responsible for the game. Rather a key portion of the original studio came from the team that made Fallout. When developing Fallout 2, the studio's first official game, several employees left Interplay to form Troika Games after they \\"were unable to come to an agreement with Interplay as to how [their] next team should be structured.\\" The remaining team would go on to release such critically acclaimed games as Fallout 2, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale. The studio also released critically acclaimed Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn developed by BioWare. In the years leading to the closure of Black Isle, Interplay's financial difficulties would worsen, leading for the team to cancel anticipated games as Black Isle's Torn and Stonekeep 2: Godmaker, releasing only Icewind Dale II, publishing Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader and developing Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II. On December 8, 2003, in the midst of serious financial difficulties, Interplay laid off the entire Black Isle Studios staff, which also resulted in the cancellation of Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance III and the original Fallout 3. In 2012, Interplay had been trying for several years to get the troubled Project V13 off the ground. Originally conceived as an massively multiplayer online game set in the world of Fallout, the project suffered a significant setback when Interplay lost all rights to use the Fallout brand. As part of their efforts to restart the project anew, Interplay revived Black Isle Studios with two of its original team members and began a crowdfunding campaign to fund a prototype in 2012. The campaign did not raise sufficient funds to develop a playable prototype, and communications from Interplay and Black Isle about the project had ceased completely by early 2014. By the end of 2015, the Black Isle website had been taken offline.

He was one of the best swordsmen of the Shinsengumi. Background He was born in 1842 or 1844 from a samurai family in the Shirakawa Domain's Edo mansion.Oji, Kazuko. Okita Soji wo Aruku. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1989, pp. 58‚Äì59 His great-grandfather was Okita Kan'emon (d. 1819) and his grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (d. 1833.) His father, Okita Katsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833‚Äì1907) and Okita Kin (1836‚Äì1908). In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita family, Okita Rintar≈ç (1826‚Äì1883), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of Kondo Shusuke in name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin-ry≈´ and Okita started training at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time, Kondo Shusuke had already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kond≈ç Isami), but Hijikata Toshiz≈ç had not yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ry≈´ school. Okita proved to be a prodigy; he mastered all the techniques and attained the Menkyo Kaiden scroll (license of total transmission) in the ry≈´ at the age of eighteen or so.Mori, Makiko. Okita S≈çji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999, pp. 9‚Äì11 In 1861, Okita became Head Coach (Jukutou) at the Shieikan. Even though he was often commented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he was also known to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students.Mori, Makiko. Okita S≈çji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999, pp. 27‚Äì28 Shinsengumi period Okita changed his name to Okita S≈çji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi some time before his departure with the R≈çshigumi to Kyoto on March 26, 1863. However, the R≈çshigumi was disbanded upon their arrival there on April 10, 1863. While the rest returned to Edo. Okita and several other founding members remained behind in Mibu to form the Mibu R≈çshigumi, which would later be renamed as the Shinsengumi on August 18, 1863. Okita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, most likely with T≈çd≈ç Heisuke being the youngest. His brother-in-law Okita Rintar≈ç, also a practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ry≈´, became a commander of the Shinch≈çgumi (the Shinsengumi's brother league in Edo.)Mori, Makiko. Okita Soji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999, p.52 Okita S≈çji soon became a Fukuch≈ç Jokin (vice-commander's assistant) of the Shinsengumi.Oji, Kazuko. Okita Soji wo Arukui. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1989, p. 111 He was one of the members involved in the Serizawa Kamo (one of the original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro assassinations in 1863.Oji, Kazuko. Okita Soji wo Aruku. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1989, p. 132 Equally skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katana, his signature technique was named the Mumyo-kenKimura, Sachihiko. Shinsengumi to Okita S≈çji. Tokyo: PHP Interface, 2002, p.29 (which roughly translates as \\"no light blade\\" or \\"unenlightened blade\\") or Sandanzuki (which translates as \\"Three Piece Thrust\\"), a technique that could attack one's neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder with one strike. (The Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but this is an embellishment.)Oji, Kazuko. Okita Soji wo Aruku. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1989, p. 20 The Mumyo-ken was his own invention and may have been derived from an invention of Hijikata's, the Hirazuki. It is a popular conception by the public that his tuberculosis was first discovered when he fainted during the Ikedaya incident, mostly due to the depiction appearing in a famous work chronicling the Shinsengumi as well as a number of period dramas based upon it. Some sources on the other hand say that he contracted the disease after that. Both theories are fairly reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (in weeks), or very slowly (many years). However, one should note that people rarely survived the disease longer than a year once it progressed to the point that they would collapse, and Okita did not die until four years after the affair. Some researchers now believe he instead collapsed due to some other ailment, such as anemia or heat stroke. While many of Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaro was killed by Okita during the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shimosawa Kan and Shiba Ry≈çtar≈ç's fiction), it is a historical inaccuracy.*Mori, Makiko. Okita Soji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999, pp.92‚Äì98 Based on Shiba Ryoutarou's fiction, many also believe that Okita and Hijikata were like brothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared a brotherly relationship with. Yamanami's seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865 was an extremely painful incident in Okita's short life.Mori, Makiko. Okita S≈çji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999, p. 78 There is no record showing that Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got along with Hijikata. In 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and also served as a kenjutsu instructor;Oji, Kazuko. Okita S≈çji wo Aruku. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1989, p. 175 later that year, he was appointed by Kondo Isami to be the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him.Mori, Makiko. Okita Soji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999, p. 132 Although highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana called Kiku-ichimonji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a wakizashi) and his so-called \\"Kikuichimonji Norimune\\" was likely a Yamashiro Kunikiyo instead.Oji, Kazuko. Okita S≈çji wo Aruku. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1989, p. 96 Death During the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi in the first month of the year Kei≈ç-4, Okita went into Matsumoto Ry≈çjun's hospital in Edo.Oji, Kazuko. Okita Soji wo Aruku. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1989, p. 235 He then moved to a guesthouse with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate forces (including the Shinsengumi and the Shinch≈çgumi) retreated to the T≈çhoku region, Okita remained in Edo alone.Mori, Makiko. Okita Soji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999, pp. 170‚Äì171 He died from tuberculosis on July 19 (the 30th day of the fifth month, by the lunar calendar), 1868. Later that night, he was buried at Sensh≈ç-ji Temple in Azabu, Edo, under his birth name (with Okita S≈çji listed in the death records.) The claim that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that he was born in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in 1868. The Sensh≈ç-ji Temple cemetery had been open to the public for years until the release of NHK's Taiga drama, Shinsengumi! in 2004. Due to the newfound interest in the Shinsengumi and Okita thanks to the drama itself, many visitors flocked to the temple to see his grave, resulting in the temple's cemetery to become restricted to the public, except for one day each year in June.Oji, Kazuko. Okita Soji wo Aruku. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1989, p. 252 Name \\"Okita\\" (Ê≤ñÁî∞) was his family name; \\"S≈çji\\" (Á∑èÂè∏) was his given name; \\"Fujiwara\\" (Ëó§Âéü) was his family clan (the surname of his ancestors); \\"Kaneyoshi\\" (ÊàøËâØ) was his jitsumei, a formal given name (like a middle name for gentlemen equivalent). It is unclear whether Okita changed his name to Okita S≈çji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi in 1863 or in 1862 (or less likely, in 1861.) There is a theory that he changed his name to S≈çji because some people around him called him \\"S≈ç-Ji\\" (short for S≈çjir≈ç.) Other than his full name, he could be referred as Okita S≈çji or Okita S≈çji Kaneyoshi. In writing, he was sometimes referred as Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi (formal name used in writing) or Okita Kaneyoshi (like the \\"initials\\" for his full name.) Stele of Okita S≈çji's last place at Imado Shrine in Asakusa This souvenir photo from the Meiji era was often wrongly introduced as the photo of Okita S≈çji though the modern times, the person in the photo is actually someone different. Currently, no existing photos of Okita S≈çji have been discovered. Okita S≈çji in popular culture Like the other members of the Shinsengumi, fictionalized accounts of Okita's life and actions appear in novels, period dramas and anime/manga series. Although his given name is sometimes pronounced as \\"Soushi\\" in the fictional world, it is actually \\"S≈çji\\". *In the 2004 Japanese drama Shinsengumi!, Okita was played by Tatsuya Fujiwara. *Okita is a main character in the anime/manga Peacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. *He is the protagonist of the manga oneshot Because Goodbyes are Coming Soon by Yukimura Makoto. *Okita is mentioned in the anime and manga series Rurouni Kenshin, which takes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. He makes a major appearance in the OVA and is briefly shown during the Kyoto Arc (before the character based on the Okita S≈çji from novel Shinsengumi Keppuroku, Seta S≈çjir≈ç, makes his appearance); in the manga, Okita is also shown during the Jinch≈´ Arc. However, some of the translations of the English dub are incorrect. In the OVA English dub, Okita is portrayed as a subordinate of Saito Hajime, when in fact he was his equal or superior in rank and kenjutsu skills. At the end of the OVA when he finally confronts Kenshin, another Shinsengumi member called Okita a lieutenant in the English dubbed track, when in fact he was the captain of the first troop. In the Japanese dub the unknown Shinsengumi member correctly refers to him as: ÁµÑÈï∑ Kumich√¥. During his brief appearance in the anime, he is shown coughing and having pain in his chest, a reference to his death by tuberculosis. *In the anime series, Intrigue in the Bakumatsu - Irohanihoheto, Okita is depicted as an old acquaintance of the protagonist, Akizuki Y≈çjir≈ç. *Okita is also one of the main playable characters in the Xbox video game Kengo: The Legend of the 9 Samurai. *In an episode of the anime Ghost Sweeper Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted movie about the Bakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy who thinks only of killing people (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the show's rendition of Hijikata.) In the anime/manga series Shura no Toki, Okita's (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sickness is with Mutsu Izumi from the Mutsu Enmei Ryuu, an unarmed martial art. Their duel was a request from Okita himself from years before. Okita appears during a flashback in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (which features Okita's fictional daughter Kaoru as one of the three main characters of the series). He also appears in the short OVA Hijikata Toshizou: Shiro no Kiseki, which attempts a proper portrayal of the Shinsengumi. *Okita is the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru, a fictional story about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate, in which Okita trains a young girl to be one of the Shinsengumi in order to avenge her father and older brother. He is also featured in the manga Getsumei Seiki. *He is depicted in the 1999 live-action film Gohatto (sometimes known as Taboo), the 2003 Japanese film When the Last Sword Is Drawn, video game series Shinsengumi Gunrou-den (as the protagonist), video game series Fu-un Shinsengumi, video game series Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi, and video game Chaos Wars. *The popular Japanese conception of Okita is that his character and his swordsmanship were of the highest purity. In Shiba Ryotaro's novels, he joined the Shinsengumi not because of his political beliefs but rather out of his loyalty for Kondo Isami and his (fictional) friendship with Hijikata Toshizo. *His anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handsome young man, sometimes a bish≈çnen. The Latin American dub of Rurouni Kenshin, even mistook Okita for a woman. In fact, in a 1991 movie, Bakumatsu J≈´nj≈çden (ÂπïÊú´Á¥îÊÉÖ‰ºù), he is portrayed as a boyish woman. In a 2003 theatrical production of the same name (which has been renewed every few years), (s)he's been portrayed over the years by actresses such as Ry≈çko Hirosue, Satomi Ishihara, Mirei Kiritani and Rena Matsui. *Soushi Yukimi, from the anime series Soar High! Isami is inspired and based on Okita S≈çji. *Okita appeared in the anime and manga series Yaiba as a fictional grandnephew of the historical Shinsengumi member of the same name. *Okita Sougo, from the anime/manga Gintama, is loosely based on Okita S≈çji. *Okita is loosely portrayed in the Japanese otome game, Hakuouki (ËñÑÊ°úÈ¨º), along with other Shinsengumi members. They are samurais who develop vampiristic qualities as the game progresses. He is also portrayed in the anime adaptation of the game. In this franchise, Okita is a skilled warrior who develops a case of tuberculosis. He drinks the ochimizu, a potion which transforms him into a rasetsu. *In the Japanese video game Sengoku Rance by Alicesoft, a female version of Okita plays a minor role, Okita Nozomi. Okita Nozomi can be recruited from the Shinsengumi in the game as a commander, and is one of the best swordsmen in the game. She is also seen constantly coughing up blood and is later diagnosed with the \\"Cough-Cough Disease\\". *The digital comic Okita and the Cat deals with the anecdotal last days of Okita S≈çji. The former swordsman is depicted as a pleasant raconteur despite his disease, though he's secretly frustrated at his inability to stand by his comrades. The comic, by Josh Hechinger and mpMann, was released for Apple mobile devices in August 2010 through Arrow Publications. *In the 2012 video game and anime Inazuma Eleven GO 2: Chrono Stone, Okita appears during the late stages of his life, but is shown playing soccer against Sakamoto Ry≈çma, and fuses with Tsurugi Ky≈çsuke to create \\"a speedy striker as quick as lightning, who cuts up the field like a lightning bolt\\". *He appears in the volume 13 of High School DxD as a member of the Lucifer group, as the knight of Sirzechs Lucifer. *In the gag manga Fate/KOHA-ACE, a spin-off of the Fate franchise created by Kinoko Nasu, the Saber-class servant, dubbed \\"Sakura Saber,\\" is the spirit of Okita Souji. In this fictional incarnation, Okita is a woman. Sakura Saber also appears as a Servant in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order. *In the eroge franchise ChuSinGura 46+1 which depicts male historical figures as young girls, Okita is a cyan-haired, amber-eyed girl. *In the anime Touken Ranbu, Okita is frequently shown in Yamatonokami Yasusada's flashbacks or dreams to be consumed by his disease during a raid relating to the Ikeda Inn Incident. Okita is shown to have long, black hair and blue eyes. *In the otome game Destined to Love, Okita is shown as a character with brown hair and brown eyes, and barely take cares of himself. He has his own route in the game. *Another otome game ¬©2015 Spaceout Inc. features Isami Kondo, Hijikata Toshizo and Soji Okita as suitors for main character. It also has other side characters like Matsumoto Ryojun, Ryoma Sakamoto and Saito Hajime. *In otome game Era of Samurai: Code of Love which developed by Voltage inc, Okita Soji along with Hijikata Toshizo, Harada Sanosuke, Saito Hajime, Kondo Isami and Shinsaku Takasugi were featured as a love interest for main character. *In the 2014 spin-off game from the Yakuza series, Ryu Ga Gotoku Ishin!, Okita Soji is visually based on series regular Goro Majima and the two share a voice as well. The game takes place in the Bakamatsu period and has the protagonist, as Sakamoto Ryouma, joining the Shinsengumi, of which Okita is a division captain. *In the anime Bakumatsu (2018) and its sequel, Bakumatsu Crisis (2019), Okita Soji plays a key antagonist role as a member of the Shinsengumi under the command of Mugensai. Other key members of the Shinsengumi such as Isami Kondo, Yamazaki Susumu and Hijikata Toshizo are also featured, in addition to Takasugi Shinsaku. *In the manga Shuumatsu no Valkyrie, Okita Soji is chosen to represent Humanity in a tournament against the gods of multiple pantheons to determine the fate of Humanity.

The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) is the European Community Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) which, together with the RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU, became European Law in February 2003. The WEEE Directive set collection, recycling and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods, with a minimum rate of 4 kilograms per head of population per annum recovered for recycling by 2009. The RoHS Directive set restrictions upon European manufacturers as to the material content of new electronic equipment placed on the market. The symbol adopted by the European Council to represent waste electrical and electronic equipment comprises a crossed-out wheelie bin with or without a single black line underneath the symbol. The black line indicates that goods have been placed on the market after 2005, when the Directive came into force. Goods without the black line were manufactured between 2002 and 2005. In such instances, these are treated as \\"historic WEEE\\" and fall outside reimbursement via producer compliance schemes. Directive revisions The directive has undergone a number of minor revisions since its inception in 2002 (Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003). These include updates in 2006 and 2009. After nine years the Directive was seen as failing to achieve some of its goals, hence the legislation had been amended again. On 20 December 2011 the European Parliament and the European Council agreed on amendments to the Directive, subject to a second-reading vote, which was taken on 19 January 2012. The changes affect the method for calculating collection rates, which were previously 4 kg per inhabitant per year. To provide a transitional period of seven years to introduce the revised method of calculation, the present method is retained for the first four years from the time the amended Directive comes into force. For the next three years, commencing with the fifth year after the amendment, the calculation of collection rates will be revised to 45% of the weight of E&E; products entering the market. Once this seven years transitional period is over, EU member states will individually select the actual collection options they wish to use. The overall aim was for the EU to recycle at least 85% of electrical and electronics waste equipment by 2016. Member state implementation The directive imposes the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the manufacturers or distributors of such equipment. It requires that those companies establish an infrastructure for collecting WEEE, in such a way that \\"Users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the possibility of returning WEEE at least free of charge\\". The directive saw the formation of national \\"producer compliance schemes\\", into which manufacturers and distributors paid an annual fee for the collection and recycling of associated waste electronics from household waste recycling centres. Deadlines The WEEE Directive obliged the then twenty-five EU member states to transpose its provisions into national law by 13 August 2004. Only Cyprus met this deadline. On 13 August 2005, one year after the deadline, all member states except for the UK had transposed at least framework regulations. The WEEE Directive was transposed into UK law in 2006, and was active the following year. Categorisations of WEEE The directive places WEEE into numerous categories, the first tier being historic and non-historic. Historic WEEE implies equipment placed on the market prior to 2005 and the WEEE directive places the onus upon the owner of the equipment to make provisions for its recycling. Where equipment was placed on the market after 2005, it is known as non-historic WEEE (denoted by a bar underneath the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol), and it is the responsibility of the producer/distributor to make provisions for its collection and recycling. The WEEE directive sets a total of 10 categories of WEEE for reporting purposes. * Large household appliances * Small household appliances * IT and telecommunications equipment * Consumer equipment * Lighting equipment * Electrical and electronic tools * Toys, leisure and sports equipment * Medical devices * Monitoring and control instruments * Automatic dispensers UK implementation dump.Waste electrical items accumulate at a dump. Prior to the implementation of the WEEE directive in the UK, waste electronic and electrical equipment was disposed of in the household (municipal) waste stream. Post the introduction of the Hazardous Waste Regulations, exclusions apply to electrical and electronic equipment that are deemed hazardous. Hazardous wastes are derived (issued with a universal EU descriptor) from the European Waste Catalogue (known in the UK as the List of Wastes), which denotes wastes with a six digit number in three sets of two. Hazardous wastes are denoted with an asterisk at the end of the number. Hazardous electronic wastes comprise: * Uninterruptable power supplies, lead-acid batteries * Cathode ray tubes (televisions, computer monitors) * Fluorescent tubes, backlights to laptop screens, thin-film transistors * Electrical/electronic equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) * Fridges and freezers, due to chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), an ozone-depleting substance. As of 2012 revisions to the regulations, all refrigerants are considered Hazardous. WEEE that is delivered to household waste recycling centres (HWRC), also known as designated collection facilities (DCFs), is collected by or delivered to approved authorised treatment facilities (AATFs). The waste electrical and electronic equipment is then weighed and categorised in accordance with the directive. Post re-processing (recycling), total volumes of each category are reported to the producer compliance scheme and the reprocessor is reimbursed accordingly. Totals of obligated WEEE for all AATFs are collated by the environment agency on a quarterly basis and reported to the EU. Historically, there were problems with the implementation of the producer compliance schemes due to a \\"double counting\\" and reporting of reprocessed WEEE to producer compliance schemes. This arose where obligated WEEE was partially treated by the first AATF to receive the waste, prior to it being passed onto a second AATF for further treatment. Both the first and second AATF would then claim against the same waste electronics, resulting in a \\"net debt\\" against the wastes being treated. Additional legislation that applies is: * The Environmental Protection (Duty of Care) Regulations 1991 * Hazardous Waste Regulations (England & Wales) 2005 * Waste Framework Directive, or Directive 2008/98/EC The management of WEEE is applied via the waste hierarchy, with particular emphasis upon reduction of waste arising, re-use of equipment and recycling (recovery) of materials: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. In January 2012, proposals were debated by the European Parliament to recast the WEEE Directive. The proposals included increasing recycling rates. Having been adopted by member states, the re- drafted directive now requires higher recovery rates of 20 kg per capita per annum as opposed to previous figures of 4 kg per capita. =Public awareness= WEEE Man at the Eden Project In April 2005 the Royal Society of Arts in the UK (in conjunction with Canon) unveiled a 7 metre tall sculpture titled WEEE Man on London's South Bank, made from 3.3 tonnes of electrical goods‚Äîthe average amount of electrical waste one UK individual creates in a lifetime. It was designed by Paul Bonomini and fabricated by Stage One Creative Services. The giant figure was subsequently moved to the Eden Project in Cornwall as part of a UK tour.

The party was led by George Geddes, formerly vice chairman of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association, supported by the then Chairman Mike Park, with the aim of securing seats in the Scottish Parliament. The party was supported by Albert McQuarrie, the former Conservative Member of Parliament for Banff and Buchan, but he refused to stand as a candidate on the grounds of age. There was speculation that this might result in the loss of votes for the Scottish National Party, as traditionally it has won the majority of the votes of those involved in the Scottish fishing industry. However, the Fishing Party did not win any seats in the 2003 election to the Scottish Parliament. Its only candidate, George Geddes, received 5,566 votes (2.28%) on the regional list in North East Scotland. The best result was in the Banff and Buchan Scottish constituency, where the party polled 2,007 votes (7.7%). The party did not stand any candidates in the single-member constituencies. The party was deregistered as a political party with the Electoral Commission on 23 March 2004 and is understood to be defunct.

A formation or position is \\"in enfilade\\" if weapons fire can be directed along its longest axis. A unit or position is \\"in defilade\\" if it uses natural or artificial obstacles to shield or conceal itself from enfilade. The strategies named by the English use the French enfiler (\\"to put on a string or sling\\") and d√©filer (\\"to slip away or off\\"), which the English nobility used at that time. Enfilade fire‚Äîgunfire directed against an enfiladed formation or position‚Äîis also commonly known as \\"flanking fire\\". Raking fire is the equivalent term in naval warfare. Strafing, firing on targets from a flying platform, is often done with enfilade fire. It is a very advantageous, and much sought for, position for the attacking force.  Enfilade  Top to bottom: a German bunker on Juno Beach with wounded Canadian soldiers, 6 June 1944. The same bunker in September 2006. Finally, the view of bunker's enfilading field of fire with respect to the seawallThe deadly result of enfilade fire during the Dieppe Raid of 1942: dead Canadian soldiers lie where they fell on \\"Blue Beach\\". Trapped between the beach and fortified sea wall, they made easy targets for MG 34 machineguns in a German bunker. The bunker firing slit is visible in the distance, just above the German soldier's head. Juno Beach on D-Day, 1944. The barbed wire fence is crude and not very high. However, when combined with the steep, curving sea wall it slows down any attacker, giving time for the machinegun bunker (visible on the far left) to enfilade any attackers. Note the soldier in the background, forced to use a ladder. A formation or position is \\"in enfilade\\" if weapon fire can be directed along its longest axis. For instance, a trench is enfiladed if the opponent can fire down the length of the trench. A column of marching troops is enfiladed if fired on from the front or rear such that the projectiles travel the length of the column. A rank or line of advancing troops is enfiladed if fired on from the side (from the flank). The advantages of enfilading missiles have been appreciated since antiquity, whether in pitched battles such as the Battle of Taginae or in fortifications designed to provide the defenders with opportunities to enfilade attacking forces. Although sophisticated archery tactics grew rare in Western Europe during the Early Middle Ages, enfilade fire was reemphasized by the late medieval English using ranked archers combined with dismounted knights, first employed at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332 and used to devastating effect against the French in the Hundred Years War. The benefit of enfilading an enemy formation is that, by firing along the long axis, it becomes easier to hit targets within that formation. Enfilade fire takes advantage of the fact that it is usually easier to aim laterally (traversing the weapon) than to correctly estimate the range to avoid shooting too long or short. Additionally, both indirect and direct fire projectiles that might miss an intended target are more likely to hit another valuable target within the formation if firing along the long axis. When planning field and other fortifications, it became common for mutually supporting positions to be arranged so that it became impossible to attack any one position without exposing oneself to enfilading fire from the others, this being found for example in the mutually supporting bastions of star forts, and the caponiers of later fortifications. Fire is delivered so that the long axis of the target coincides or nearly coincides with the long axis of the beaten zone.  Defilade  A unit or position is \\"in defilade\\" if it uses natural or artificial obstacles to shield or conceal. For an armored fighting vehicle (AFV), defilade is synonymous with a hull-down or turret-down position. Defilade is also used to refer to a position on the reverse slope of a hill or within a depression in level or rolling terrain. Defiladed positions on hilltops are advantageous because \\"dead space\\" ‚Äì a space that cannot be engaged with direct fire ‚Äì will be created in front of the position. Ideally, this dead space should be covered by the interlocking fields of fire of other nearby positions, and/or by pre-planned indirect fire such as mortars or other forms of artillery. In the case of antitank weapons, and especially short- range man-portable antitank rockets, defiladed positions behind a hill have several important advantages. This is because the dead space created by the intervening crest of the hill prevents an approaching tank from using the range of its direct-fire weapons, and neither the attacker nor defender will have a clear shot until the tank is within range of the defending antitank weapon. In such engagements the tank is usually at a further disadvantage because the defender will often be camouflaged while the attacking tank will be silhouetted against the sky, giving the defender an easier shot. In addition, if the tank fails to detect the defending antitank weapon while the tank is still defiladed, but advances beyond that position to the crest of the hill, it may expose the relatively thinner armor of its lower hull or belly to the defender. Early detection and elimination of antitank threats is an important reason that tanks attack with infantry support. Artificial entrenchments can provide defilade by allowing troops to seek shelter behind a raised berm that increases the effective height of the ground, within an excavation that allows the troops to shelter below the surface of the ground or a combination of the two. The same principles apply to fighting positions for artillery and armored fighting vehicles.  Enfilade‚Äìdefilade combination  A unit sited in defilade threatens an enemy that decides to pass it and move forward, because the enemy would be put in an enfiladed position when moving in a rank. The friendly unit would be in a position that is shielded by terrain from direct enemy fire, while still being able to fire on the enemy in an effective manner.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was one of the first songs written by McCartney, who wrote it when he was 16. The song was recorded in a different key than the final recording; it was sped up at the request of McCartney to make his voice sound younger. It prominently features a trio of clarinets (two regular clarinets and one bass clarinet) throughout. Composition The song is sung by a young man to his lover, and is about his plans of their growing old together. Although the theme is ageing, it was one of the first songs McCartney wrote, when he was 16. It was in the Beatles' setlist in their early days as a song to perform when their amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off. Both George Martin and Mark Lewisohn speculated that McCartney may have thought of the song when recording began for Sgt. Pepper in December 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year. John Lennon said of the song, \\"Paul wrote it in the Cavern days. We just stuck a few more words on it like 'grandchildren on your knee' and 'Vera, Chuck and Dave'‚Ä¶ this was just one that was quite a hit with us.\\" Instrumentation A clarinet trio (two B clarinets and a bass clarinet) is featured prominently in the song. Scored by Martin, he said they were added at McCartney's request to \\"get around the lurking schmaltz factor\\" by using the clarinets \\"in a classical way.\\" In the song's final verse, the clarinet is played in harmony with McCartney's vocal. Supporting instruments include the piano, bass, drum set, tubular bells, and electric guitar. Recording The song was recorded on 6 December 1966, during one of the first sessions for the as-yet-unnamed album that became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. There were multiple overdub sessions, including the lead vocal by McCartney on 8 December and backing vocals by McCartney, Lennon, and George Harrison on 20 December. The clarinets were recorded on 21 December. The song is in the key of D major. Recorded in C major, the master take was sped up to raise the key by one semitone at the insistence of McCartney. Martin remembers that McCartney suggested this change to make his voice sound younger. McCartney says, \\"I wanted to appear younger, but that was just to make it more rooty- tooty; just lift the key because it was starting to sound turgid.\\" Release The song was nearly released on a single as the B-side of either \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" or \\"Penny Lane\\". It was instead held over to be included as an album track for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was also included in the film Yellow Submarine.

Bangor is located 28 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire in the area commonly called Menai. Bangor sits south of the Georges River and to the west of the Woronora River. History The name 'Bangor' was selected in 1895 by the land's owner, a farmer named Owen Jones, after his birthplace Bangor in Wales. To avoid confusion with Bangor in Tasmania, the Postmaster General's Office changed the suburb name to Menai in 1910. Another Australian Bangor is located in South Australia. Menai Bridge is a town opposite the original Bangor, on the Menai Strait in Wales. When Menai expanded, the eastern section was renamed Bangor in 1976.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia As part of the modern development of Bangor, the streets were all named with an Aboriginal theme Population In the 2016 Census, there were 5,568 people in Bangor. 81.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 3.8%. 87.4% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek at 1.8%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 29.7%, Anglican 25.4% and No Religion 18.8%. Commercial area Bangor is a mostly residential suburb with a small shopping centre which consists of Bangor Community Pharmacy, Bangor Newsagency, Bangor Post Office, Bangor Bakery, Manson Property, Friendly Grocer supermarket, Peter's Bangor Chinese, Thai Max, ABC School Wear, Bangor Dry Cleaners, Bangor Butchers and Little FinsSwim School. In late 2018, the shopping centre commenced renovations. Bangor Tavern is in a neighbouring building. A commercial car wash and fitness gym also operate in the immediate area of the shopping centre. Schools * Bangor Public School: K-6 * Inaburra School: K-12 Churches *Menai Salvation Army *Menai Baptist Church (meeting in Inaburra School) Transport The main road running through Bangor and Menai is Menai Road. The Bangor Bypass was completed in February 2005 to alleviate traffic in the area. Transdev NSW buses (routes 961 and 962) connect Bangor to Menai, Illawong, Alfords Point, Barden Ridge, Padstow, Bankstown, Sutherland, Kirrawee, Gymea and Miranda. Metrobus M92 runs between Sutherland and Parramatta via Bankstown. It also runs a weekend bus service to Cronulla. The closest train station is Sutherland, on the T4 Illawarra line; although Padstow on the T8 East Hills/Airport line is also frequently used. Transdev buses service Bangor from both these train stations. A family friendly cycle way runs from Sutherland to Padstow through Bangor, which links up with the broader Sydney cycle way. Sport and recreation Bangor has tennis courts at Pyree St and Yala Rd. Yala Rd sporting facilities also include netball courts. Bangor also has two sporting ovals (Akuna Oval and Billa Oval) named after the roads they are situated on. Bangor is home to the Bangor Brumbies soccer club and its home field is Billa Oval. The Menai Roosters football team uses Akuna Oval as its home oval. The Bangor Scout Grouphttp://www.bangorscouts.org.au/ was established in 1986 with a Scout Hall in Ross Reserve in Pyree Street and caters for youth aged from 6 to 26 years old. The nearby rivers and extensive bush areas are popular with the locals and offer a variety of outdoor activities including bush walking, mountain bike riding, canoeing, kayaking, rowing, fishing. A small commercial swimming pool operates from the Bangor Shopping Centre. A larger council run swimming complex operates at Sutherland. Children's playgrounds exist at: Akuna Reserve, Billa Oval, Jelba Reserve, Ross Reserve.

He was one of the few core members who survived the numerous wars of the Bakumatsu period. He was later known as and worked as a police officer in Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration. Early years He was born in Edo, Musashi Province (now Tokyo).It≈ç, \\"Takada kinshin kara Tonami zaij≈´roku,\\" p. 145 Very little is known about his early life. He was born to , an ashigaru of the Akashi Domain, who had bought the rank of gokenin (a low-ranking retainer directly serving the Tokugawa sh≈çgun), and his wife . He had an older brother named Hiroaki and an older sister named Katsu. According to the published records of his family, Sait≈ç left Edo in 1862, after accidentally killing a hatamoto.It≈ç, \\"Shinsengumi kessei made,\\" p. 40. He went to Kyoto and taught in the d≈çj≈ç of a man named Yoshida, who had relied on Sait≈ç's father Y≈´suke in the past. His style of swordsmanship is not clear. According to a tradition of his descendants, his style comes from Itt≈ç-ry≈´. His style is considered to be Mugai Ry≈´ that originates from Yamaguchi Itt≈ç-ry≈´. He is also considered to have learned Tsuda Ichi-den-ry≈´ and Sekiguchi-ry≈´.Akama Wako,Shinsengumi Sait≈ç Hajime No Nazo(Japanese), Sinjinbutuouraisha,pp. 52‚Äì57 Shinsengumi Period The same age as Okita S≈çji and another member named T≈çd≈ç Heisuke, the three shared the distinction of being the youngest in Kond≈ç Isami's group and being among its most gifted swordsmen. As a member of the Shinsengumi, Sait≈ç was said to be an introvert and a mysterious person; a common description of his personality says he \\"was not a man predisposed to small talk\\". Sait≈ç was an unusually tall man at . He was also noted to be very dignified, especially in his later years. He always made sure that his obi was tied properly and when he walked he was careful not to drag his feet. At rest he always sat in the formal position, called seiza, and he would remain very alert so that he could react instantly to any situations that might occur. He was, however, known to be very intimidating when he wanted to be. Along with his duties as Captain of the Third Squad in the Shinsengumi, he was also responsible for weeding out any potential spies within the Shinsengumi ranks. Members had to constantly be mindful of what they said around him. His original position within the Shinsengumi was . His duties included being a kenjutsu instructor. During the Ikedaya incident on July 8, 1864, Sait≈ç was with Hijikata Toshiz≈ç's group that arrived later at the Ikedaya Inn. In August 20, 1864, Sait≈ç and the rest of the Shinsengumi took part in the Kinmon incident against the Ch≈çsh≈´ rebels. In the reorganization of the ranks in November 1864, he was first assigned as the fourth unit's captain and would later receive an award from the shogunate for his part in the Kinmon incident. At the Shinsengumi new headquarters at Nishi Hongan-ji in April 1865, he was assigned as the third unit's captain. Sait≈ç was considered to be on the same level of swordsmanship as the first troop captain Okita S≈çji and the second troop captain Nagakura Shinpachi. In fact, it is rumoured that Okita feared his sword skill. Despite prior connections to Aizu, his descendants dispute that he served as a spy. His controversial reputation comes from accounts that he executed several corrupt members of the Shinsengumi; however, rumors vary as to his role in the deaths of Tani Sanj≈´r≈ç in 1866 and Takeda Kanry≈´sai in 1867.Name reading as per T≈çd≈ç, p. 198. His role as an internal spy for the Shinsengumi is also questionable; one common example being that he is said to have been instructed to join It≈ç Kashitar≈ç's splinter group Gory≈ç Eji K≈çdai-ji faction, to spy on them, which eventually led to the Aburanok≈çji incident in December 13, 1867. However, this is disputed by Abe J≈´r≈ç, who did not believe he was a spy. It is probable that he also monitored other intelligence and enemy activity. Together with the rest of the Shinsengumi, he became a hatamoto in 1867. Later in late December 1867, Sait≈ç and a group of six Shinsengumi members were assigned to protect Miura Ky≈´tar≈ç, who was one of the major suspects of the assassination of Sakamoto Ry≈çma. On January 1, 1868, they fought against sixteen assassins who were trying to kill Miura in revenge at the Tenmaya Inn on what was known as the Tenmaya incident. After the outbreak of the Boshin War from January 27, 1868 onwards, Sait≈ç, under the name , took part in Shinsengumi's fight during the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi and the Battle of K≈çsh≈´-Katsunuma, before withdrawing with the surviving members to Edo and later to the Aizu domain. Due to Hijikata being incapacitated as a result of the injuries sustained at the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle, Sait≈ç became the commander of the Aizu Shinsengumi around May 26, 1868 and continued on into the Battle of Shirakawa. After the Battle of Bonari Pass, when Hijikata decided to retreat from Aizu, Sait≈ç and a small group of 20 members parted with Hijikata and rest of the surviving Shinsengumi and continued to fight alongside with the Aizu army against the imperial army until the very end of the Battle of Aizu. This parting account was recorded in Kuwana retainer Taniguchi Shir≈çbei's diary, where it was recorded as an occurrence also involving ≈åtori Keisuke, whom Hijikata requested to take command of the Shinsengumi; thus the said confrontation was not with Hijikata. However, questions regarding this parting remain, especially considering the conflicting dates. Sait≈ç, along with the few remaining men of the Shinsengumi who went with him, fought against the imperial army at Nyorai-d≈ç (a small temple near Aizuwakamatsu Castle), where they were severely outnumbered.Kikuchi, \\"Sait≈ç Hajime no Aizu-sens≈ç\\", pp. 126‚Äì130. It was at the Battle of Nyorai-d≈ç that Sait≈ç was thought to have been killed in action; however, he managed to get back to Aizu lines and joined the Aizu domain's military as a member of the Suzakutai. After Aizuwakamatsu Castle fell, Sait≈ç and the five surviving members joined a group of former Aizu retainers who traveled southwest to the Takada Domain in Echigo Province, where they were held as prisoners of war. In the records listing the Aizu men detained in Takada, Sait≈ç is on record as Ichinose Denpachi.It≈ç, \\"Takada kinshin kara Tonami zaij≈´roku\\", pp. 137‚Äì138. Meiji Restoration Sait≈ç, under the new name , traveled to Tonami, the new domain of the Matsudaira clan of Aizu. He took up residence with Kurasawa Heijiemon, the Aizu kar≈ç who was an old friend of his from Kyoto. Kurasawa was involved in the migration of Aizu samurai to Tonami and the building up of the settlements in Tonami (now Aomori Prefecture), particularly in Gonohe village. In Tonami, Fujita met Shinoda Yaso, the daughter of an Aizu retainer. The two met through Kurasawa, who was then living with Ueda Shichir≈ç, another Aizu retainer. Kurasawa sponsored Fujita and Yaso's marriage on August 25, 1871; the couple lived in Kurasawa's house. It was also around this time that Fujita may have become associated with the Police Bureau. Fujita and Yaso moved out of the Kurasawa house on February 10, 1873, and started living in the Ueda household. When on June 10, 1874, he left Tonami for Tokyo, Yaso moved in with Kurasawa and the Kurasawa family records last entry of her is in 1876. It is unknown what happened afterwards. It was around this time Fujita Gor≈ç began to work as a police officer in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. In 1874, Fujita married Takagi Tokio.It≈ç, \\"Sait≈ç Hajime nenfu\\", p. 238 Tokio was the daughter of Takagi Koj≈´r≈ç, a retainer of the Aizu domain.Nagaya, p. 36 Her original name was Sada; she served for a time as lady-in-waiting to Matsudaira Teru. The marriage is believed to have been sponsored by the former Aizu kar≈ç Yamakawa Hiroshi and Sagawa Kanbei as well as the former lord of Aizu Matsudaira Katamori.It≈ç, p. 238 Fujita and Tokio had three children: Tsutomu (1876‚Äì1956); Tsuyoshi (1879‚Äì1946); and Tatsuo (1886‚Äì1945).Nagaya, p. 36. Tsutomu and his wife Nishino Midori had seven children; the Fujita family continues to the present day through Tar≈ç and Naoko Fujita, the children of Tsutomu's second son Makoto. Fujita's third son Tatsuo was adopted by the Numazawa family, Tokio's maternal relatives (another family of Aizu kar≈ç) whose family had nearly been wiped out in the Boshin War. Photo believed to depict Sait≈ç Hajime (as Fujita Gor≈ç) (bottom right encircled) with his police troop. Sait≈ç (as Fujita Gor≈ç), 53, is seated with his second son Tsuyoshi, his eldest son Tsutomu, and his wife Tokio in 1897, his third son Tatsuo (not pictured) had since adopted into the Numazawa family Fujita fought on the Meiji government's side during Saig≈ç Takamori's Satsuma rebellion, as a member of the police forces sent to support the Imperial Japanese Army.It≈ç, pp. 238‚Äì239 During his lifetime, Fujita Gor≈ç shared some of his Shinsengumi experiences with a select few, these included Aizu natives Yamakawa Kenjir≈ç and Takamine Hideo, whose houses he frequented. He would drink sake with Yamakawa and Takamine and tell stories of his past.T≈çd≈ç, pp. 194, 198, 204 However, he did not write anything about his activity in the Shinsengumi as Nagakura Shinpachi did. During his life in the Meiji period, Fujita was the only one who was authorized by the government to carry a katana despite the collapse of the Tokugawa rule. In 1875, Fujita assisted Nagakura Shinpachi (as Sugimura Yoshie) and Matsumoto Ry≈çjun in setting up a memorial monument known as Grave of Shinsengumi in honor of Kond≈ç Isami, Hijikata Toshiz≈ç, and other deceased Shinsengumi members at Itabashi, Tokyo.It≈ç, \\"Sait≈ç Hajime nenfu\\", p. 238. Following his retirement from Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department in 1890, Fujita worked as a guard for Tokyo National Museum, and later as a clerk and accountant for Tokyo Women's Normal School from 1899, as well as for the Tokyo Higher Normal School, jobs he secured thanks to his friendship with Takamine Hideo.T≈çd≈ç, p. 198. Takamine also relied upon Fujita's skill as an appraiser of swords, and gave Fujita permission to freely enter his art warehouse. Death Saito's grave at Amidaji, Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan in 2008 Fujita's heavy drinking was believed to have contributed to his death from a stomach ulcer. He died in 1915 at age 72, sitting in seiza in his living room.It≈ç, p. 242. Upon his will, he was buried at Amidaji, Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan.  Sait≈ç in fiction  Since he has been featured in several anime and manga Sait≈ç has become a well-known figure among young anime fans in the west. He is also predominate in other media spanning several genres about the Shinsengumi. Sait≈ç's appearance in Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin series is likely the best-known of his manga and anime incarnations. The series introduces Sait≈ç as an anti-hero and eventual ally to the protagonist Himura Kenshin, and depicts several of the known historical descriptions of him from real life, from his personality and role in the Shinsengumi to his being left-handed. As Watsuki is a self-proclaimed Hijikata Toshizo fan, Sait≈ç makes in-series call-backs to his time in the Shinsengumi by peddling Hijikata's ishida sanyaku powdered medicine as a cover, and states that his Gatotsu attack is a perfected version of Hijikata's Hiratsuki. His famous 'swift death to evil' (aku soku zan) motto in the series was also the theme of an entry in the 2000 International Obfuscated C Code Contest, in which a series of programmed source code featuring his anime portrait in ASCII Art wrote other programs that eventually formed a loop spelling out aku soku zan. In the 2012 live-action film adaptation and its sequels Sait≈ç is played by Y≈çsuke Eguchi. Keiichiro Washizuka of The Last Blade games invokes Sait≈ç Hajime's design in the Rurouni Kenshin: Trust & Betrayal OVA while also sporting Kenshin's famous scar. He fights with a series of ‚Äòsliding charge‚Äô attacks that resemble the Gatotsu. He is parodied in the anime Gintama as Sait≈ç Shimaru, a narcoleptic with a fear of speaking. In the series, he holds the role of an internal investigator of the Shinsengumi, a post he was said to have held in real life, and is also regarded as its most deadly member by Okita Sougo, the Gintama proxy of Okita S≈çji. Sait≈ç is the third unit captain of the Shinsengumi in Peacemaker Kurogane. Here he is perpetually sleepy with droopy eyes and a soft voice and the supernatural ability to see ghosts. And similar to his depiction in Rurouni Kenshin, he is shown with a fondness for soba. He is portrayed as a quiet and serious spy in Kaze Hikaru. He is also the protagonist of the manga Burai, a fictional story about the Shinsengumi during the later part of the Tokugawa shogunate. Sait≈ç is featured in the manga Getsumei Seiki, in later episodes of the anime Shura no Toki: Age of Chaos, and the video game series Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi and Code of the Samurai. In the 2003 Japanese film When the Last Sword Is Drawn, Sait≈ç is played by K≈çichi Sat≈ç. At first, Sato portrays Sait≈ç as a cold, dark, uncaring captain of the Shinsengumi. However, Sait≈ç changes as a man through his interactions with Kanichiro Yoshimura (played by Kiichi Nakai) during the last years of the Shinsengumi. Sait≈ç Hajime is also shown in the Haku≈çki Shinsengumi Kitan otome visual novel games, as well as its film, anime, and manga adaptations. Here, like his historical inspiration, he is very reserved and analytical, using a left- handed sword technique and later joining It≈ç's splinter group at the order of Hijikata. He appears in several NHK productions. In the 2004 NHK Taiga drama Shinsengumi! Sait≈ç is played by Joe Odagiri. In the 2013 Taiga drama Yae no Sakura, he is played by Kenji Furuya of Dragon Ash, and Shugo Oshinari portrays him in one episode of the NHK historical documentary series Rekishi Hiwa Historia. Sait≈ç also appears in Yakuza Ishin, where he is portrayed as a false identity of the game's version of Sakamoto Ry≈çma. Sait≈ç also appears in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order as a limited 4-Star Saber-class Servant which debuted during the GUDAGUDA Yamatai-koku 2020 event.

It is 16 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district and is located in the local government area of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown, having previously been the administrative centre of the City of Bankstown prior to 2016. It is the larger of the two main CBDs in the City of Canterbury-Bankstown, the other being Campsie. History Florenza Estate, Upper Bankstown, 1929, subdivision plan. Before European settlement, Cumberland Plains Woodland occupied much of the area. Turpentine ironbark forest covered much of what is now Bankstown. The land was occupied by the Bediagal people. Their land bordered the Dharawal and the Darung people. In 1795, Matthew Flinders and George Bass explored up the Georges River for about beyond what had been previously surveyed, and reported favourably to Governor Hunter of the land on its banks. Hunter examined the country himself, and established one of the pioneer colonies there, called Bank's Town, today written as one word Bankstown. Hunter named the area Bankstown after Sir Joseph Banks, who travelled to Australia with Captain James Cook in 1770. The area of first European settlement along the river has been partially preserved as part of the Mirambeena Regional Park. Foundation Stone from first Bankstown Town hall The first town hall and Council Chambers were opened on 22 Oct 1898 Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers Advocate (Parramatta), Wednesday 2 November 1898, page 6 on the northern side of the Hume Highway (Liverpool Road), near Rookwood Road (site of the Three Swallows Hotel). The council chambers were relocated to a new building in South Terrace (now Old Town Centre Plaza) in June 1918. The building still stands and now has a shopping arcade running through it. Foundation stones from the old Town Halls have been preserved in a display outside the current Council Chambers. In 1826, bush rangers were hanged on the site of the water tower Bankstown Reservoir. =World War II= Bankstown Plaza 1946. In 1939, local residents were made privy to the events of World War II. Conscripted residents were required to report for duty at a drill hall on Canterbury Road, Belmore. Camps were set up in and around Canterbury Racecourse and local parks in the district. Residents with foreign names were sent to internment camps as there was growing suspicion about residents with foreign names. A portion of these folk were Australian citizens who served with the Australian armed forces during World War I. During World War II, Bankstown Airport was established as a key strategic air base to support the war effort. After the arrival of Douglas MacArthur in Australia, control of Bankstown Airport was handed to US Forces, becoming home to US 35th Fighter Squadron and the 41st Pursuit Squadron of the United States Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces who occupied the airport from 1942 to 1944.

This unit was formed in Bankstown, on 25 February 1942. Their living quarters were located next door and down the road from the hall & the staff were housed in galvanised iron barracks. Operations were handed over to the United States Army Air Corps on 10 April 1942 before they were transferred to a disused railway tunnel at St James railway station in Sydney. The unit was renamed, Air Defence Headquarters Sydney (ADHQ) on 21 January 1945 and moved into a three-storey semi-underground purpose built operations and plotting facility at Bankstown, known as the Bankstown Bunker.No. 1 Fighter Sector Headquarters RAAF, later known as No. 101 Fighter Control Unit RAAF World War II began Bankstown's industrial revolution. Few factories or industry of any consequence were located in Bankstown prior to 1945, this was changed dramatically between 1942 and 1954, especially when the Department of Aircraft Production gave approval for aircraft manufacturer Hawker De Havilland, to operate a factory at the airport for the production and manufacture of de Havilland Mosquito bombers. There are now over seven-thousand businesses operating within the Bankstown district.About Bankstown Council Bankstown Bunker The Bankstown Bunker is a disused RAAF operations facility, located on the corner of Marion and Edgar Street, Bankstown. The specially constructed bunker became an important Royal Australian Air Force headquarters from 1945 until its closure in 1947. The Bankstown Bunker is of similar design to the underground Ops rooms of wartime England, which directed Britain's air defence fighter plane attacks on the invading German Luftwaffe. Entrance to the bunker was obtained through a concrete passageway which was well screened by a grassy slope, a stairway led to a maze of corridors and hallways leading to various sections.(information supplied by R. Eyers VAOC worker) The Bankstown bunker is currently buried under a public park, surrounded by residential dwellings at the northern end of Taylor Street.Images of the Bankstown Bunker located in Condell Park. =Post World War II= Bankstown Civic Tower After World War II, Bankstown's population increased dramatically. People relocated from the inner-city and incoming migrants came, first from Europe and towards the end of the 20th century from Asia and the Middle East (especially Vietnamese and Lebanese) and the rest of the world. Bankstown Council relocated to its third premises in 1963 when the Civic Centre that is located on the corner of Chapel Road and The Mall was constructed. It included the Council Chambers or 'Roundhouse', as it's called and is still in use today as an administration building. The current town hall was built in 1973. The administration building was destroyed by fire on 1 July 1997. Council offices relocated to Bankstown Civic Tower (the blue tower) in 1999 and on 13 June 2000 Bankstown's now popular Central Park, where the former administration building once stood, was officially declared Paul Keating Park. =Heritage= Bankstown has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Beresford Avenue: Bankstown Reservoir Climate Bankstown has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cfa).

Bankstown's annual mean rainfall is 869.0mm, slightly less than the Sydney CBD, which is affected more by coastal showers which do not penetrate very far inland. Commercial area Bankstown's central business district is clustered around Bankstown railway station. The commercial area beside the railway station is known as Bankstown Plaza, while the ethnic diversity of the area has resulted in a host of restaurants, eateries and cafes. Bankstown Central Shopping Centre, formerly known as Centro Bankstown and previously known as Bankstown Square, is a large shopping centre, immediately to the northeast of the railway Station. It was first opened in 1966 and has been expanded a number of times. The Bankstown Central Library has been serving Bankstown on its present site in The Mall since 1954. Eight years earlier in 1946, Bankstown became the first municipality to adopt the Library Act of 1939 by opening a Children's Library, located at Restwell Street. The Bankstown Central Library was demolished in 1981 to make way for a current facility which opened in 1983. Bankstown is the seat of major industry including the aviation, engineering and maintenance at Bankstown Airport. Other employers include small industrial operations, the public service and the retail industry. The suburb is affected with unusually high unemployment and is subject to a dedicated income management program specifically targeting the problem. Transport Northern entrance to Bankstown railway station Bankstown railway station is on the Bankstown line of the Sydney Trains network. The rail line was built to Belmore in 1895 and then extended to Bankstown in 1909. The line was electrified in 1926. In 1928, the line was extended westwards from Bankstown to join the Main Suburban railway at Lidcombe and the Main South line to Liverpool. Bankstown is a major bus interchange for a number of bus services. The Sydney Metropolitan Airport, more commonly known as Bankstown Airport, was established in 1940 and is constructed on 313 hectares. It has three runways, an extensive taxiway and includes a large business park containing over 170 businesses. Schools In 1862, the Church of England School was first opened and was commissioned as a public school in 1867. Bankstown's first public school was built where McLeod Reserve is currently situated in 1880. In 1882 49 boys and 36 girls were enrolled, and upkeep expenses totalled 219 pounds, eight shillings and 11 pence. The school's first headmaster was Dugald McLeod who taught at the school since its opening until 1912. The site of the well used by Bankstown Public School is today commemorated by a plaque. The school was demolished in 1924 due to the development of North Bankstown School in the same year.File:First public school in bankstown sign.jpg ‚Äì wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Botany is located 11 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the Bayside Council.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 Botany sits on the northern shore of Botany Bay, east of Sydney Airport, adjacent to the suburbs of Mascot, Banksmeadow, Pagewood and Port Botany. History Real estate map of Botany, 1907 Botany Bay, to the south, is where Captain James Cook first landed on 29 April 1770, when navigating his way around Australia on his ship, the Endeavour. The ship's English botanist Joseph Banks and Swedish assistant botanist Daniel Solander, spent several days on shore collecting vast numbers of specimens, that were previously unknown in Europe. Cook's journals first referred to the bay as Sting Rays' Harbour, then later Botanist Bay and finally both these names were crossed out and replaced with Botany Bay. The suburb name comes from the bay it stands on.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and Robertson) 1990, p.35 Botany was originally planned as an agricultural district, in the same way the surrounding suburbs were used for market gardens. However, it became an industrial area with fellmongers yards and slaughter works. In 1809, Mr E Redmond was one of the first to settle here and Simeon Lord (1771‚Äì1840) was an important developer in the area who built a fulling mill in 1815. In 1823 he was granted and more grants followed. Part of his estate was subdivided in 1859 to create the Booralee Township and the rest was subdivided in 1887. The Sydney Waterworks were established in Botany in 1858.Book of Sydney Suburbs, p.35 The Sir Joseph Banks Hotel was a popular hotel on the shores of Botany Bay. By 1850, a private zoo had been established there and visitors could go horse riding, play cricket and football. International athletes challenged the locals in the Sir Joseph Banks Handicap on the racetrack. In 1988, the Sir Joseph Banks Pleasure Gardens were refurbished with local industry contributions. The racing track was restored and an annual event called the Botany Bay Gift attracted international athletes again. The hotel, which was built in stages from 1840, is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/14 The other historic landmark in the area is St Matthew's Church of England, on the corner of Botany Road and Lord Street. It was built in 1862 and is now on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, p.2/14 =Former tram line service= The city line to Botany opened in 1882 as a steam tramway, with electric services commencing in 1903. The service from Circular Quay initially via Elizabeth, Chalmers and Redfern Streets (from 1902), then in 1933 via Pitt and Castlereagh Streets, and Eddy Avenue, Lee and Regents Streets, to Botany Street in Waterloo. A single-track connection along Bourke and O'Dea Streets joined at the present day Green Square, allowing access to the Dowling Street Depot. The line then passed down the entire length of Botany Road to Botany. In Mascot, a branch led to the former Ascot Racecourse at the site of Sydney Airport. Points were provided at Bay Street on Botany Road in Botany, for short working. The line was double track throughout. From Botany, a single-track line crossed the Botany Goods railway at Beauchamp Road, then passed along Perry Street and Bunnerong Road, past the former Bunnerong Power Station to join the La Perouse line at Yarra Junction. Generally a shuttle service operated on this single track section between Botany, and La Perouse. This single-track line was cut back to Military Road in 1935. The line from the junctions at Cleveland Street to Botany, closed in 1960. Sydney Buses route 309 generally follows the route.

Lady Robinsons Beach is a prominent beach in the area. Housing Botany features low density housing and increasingly medium density developments, particularly terraces and small apartment buildings. This increase in development in Botany has been as a result of increased urbanisation, with the redevelopment of industrial areas, allowing developers to take advantage of the proximity to beaches and CBD.

It is primarily made of limestone, with some marble. Its highest peak is Mount Kyparissovouno (also known as Selvili Tepe), at . Pentadaktylos (also spelt Pentadactylos; ; is another name for the Kyrenia Mountains, though Britannica refers to Pentadaktylos as the \\"western portion\\" of the latter, or the part west of Melounta. Pentadaktylos (lit. \\"five-fingered\\") is so-named after one of its most distinguishing features, a peak that resembles five fingers. A devastating fire in July 1995 burned large portions of the Kyrenia Mountains, resulting in the loss of significant forest land and natural habitat. The only other mountain range in Cyprus is the Troodos Mountains. Geology These mountains are a series of sedimentary formations from the Permian to the Middle Miocene pushed up by a collision of the African and Eurasian plates. Though only half the height of the Troodos Mountains, the Kyrenia Mountains are rugged and rise abruptly from the Mesaoria plain. History The location of the mountains near the sea made them desirable locations for watch towers and castles overlooking the northern Cyprus coast, as well as the central plain. These castles generally date from the 10th through the 15th centuries, primarily constructed by the Byzantines and Lusignans. The castles of St. Hilarion, Buffavento, and Kantara sit astride peaks and were of strategic importance during much of the history of Cyprus during the Middle Ages. Painted flag The flag of Northern Cyprus on the mountainside A flag of Northern Cyprus is painted on the southern slope of the Kyrenia Mountains. It is reportedly 425metres wide and 250metres high, and is illuminated at night. The flag is considered controversial as evidenced in the Parliamentary Question put to the European Parliament by Antigoni Papadopoulou on 22 October 2009, \\"How can it permit the existence of such a flag which, apart from the catastrophic environmental damage it causes, the use of chemical substances and the brutal abuse of the environment, involves an absurd waste of electricity at a time of economic crisis? Does Turkey show sufficient respect towards the environment to justify its desire to open the relevant chapter of accession negotiations?\\" Legends There are many legends about the Pentadactylos mountains. One tells the story of a conceited villager who fell in love with the local queen and asked for her hand in marriage. The queen wished to be rid of the impertinent young man and requested that he bring her some water from the spring of Apostolos Andreas monastery in the Karpas, a perilous journey in those days. The man set off and after several weeks returned with a skin full of that precious water. The queen was most dismayed to see that he had succeeded, but still refused to marry him. In a fit of rage, he poured the water on to the earth, seized a handful of the resulting mud and threw it at the queens head. She ducked and the lump of mud sailed far across the plain to land on top of the Kyrenia mountain range, where it is to this day, still showing the impression of the thwarted villager‚Äôs five fingers. Another famous one is of the Byzantine hero Digenis Akritas. Tradition has it that Digenis Akritas's hand gripped the mountain to get out of the sea when he came to free Cyprus from its Saracen invaders, and this is his handprint. (He also threw a large rock across Cyprus to get at the Saracen ships. That rock landed in Paphos at the site of the birthplace of Aphrodite, thus known to this day as Petra Tou Romiou or \\"Rock of the Greek\\".

Regarded as an auteur, in 1946, he became the first filmmaker elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Although his work is less fashionable than it once was, Pagnol is still generally regarded as one of France's greatest 20th-century writers and is notable for the fact that he excelled in almost every medium‚Äîmemoir, novel, drama and film. Early life Pagnol was born on 28 February 1895 in Aubagne, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department, in southern France near Marseille, the eldest son of schoolteacher Joseph Pagnol and seamstress Augustine Lansot.Castans (1987), pp. 363‚Äì368 Marcel Pagnol grew up in Marseille with his younger brothers Paul and Ren√©, and younger sister Germaine. = School years = In July 1904, the family rented the Bastide Neuve, ‚Äì a house in the sleepy Proven√ßal village of La Treille ‚Äì for the summer holidays, the first of many spent in the hilly countryside between Aubagne and Marseille.Castans (1987), p. 22. About the same time, Augustine's health, which had never been robust, began to noticeably decline and on 16 June 1910 she succumbed to a chest infection (\\"mal de poitrine\\") and died, aged 36.Castans (1987), pp. 27, 32. Joseph remarried in 1912. In 1913, at the age of 18, Marcel passed his baccalaureate in philosophy and started studying literature at the University in Aix-en-Provence. When World War I broke out, he was called up into the infantry at Nice but in January 1915 he was discharged because of his poor constitution (\\"faiblesse de constitution'). On 2 March 1916, he married Simone Colin in Marseille and in November graduated in English. He became an English teacher, teaching in various local colleges and at a lyc√©e in Marseille. Career = Time in Paris= In 1922, he moved to Paris, where he taught English until 1927, when he decided instead to devote his life to playwriting. During this time, he belonged to a group of young writers, in collaboration with one of whom, Paul Nivoix, he wrote the play, Merchants of Glory, which was produced in 1924. This was followed, in 1928, by Topaze, a satire based on ambition. Exiled in Paris, he returned nostalgically to his Proven√ßal roots, taking this as his setting for his play Marius, which later became the first of his works to be adapted into a film in 1931. Separated from Simone Collin since 1926 (though not divorced until 1941), he formed a relationship with the young English dancer Kitty Murphy. Their son Jacques Pagnol was born on 24 September 1930. (Jacques later became his father's assistant and subsequently a cameraman for France 3 Marseille.) = Filmmaking career = In 1929, on a visit to London, Pagnol attended a screening of one of the first talking films and he was so impressed that he decided to devote his efforts to cinema. He contacted Paramount Picture studios and suggested adapting his play Marius for cinema. This was directed by Alexander Korda and released on 10 October 1931. It became one of the first successful French-language talking films. In 1932 Pagnol founded his own film production studios in the countryside near Marseille. Over the next decade Pagnol produced his own films, taking many different roles in the production ‚Äì financier, director, script writer, studio head, and foreign-language script translator ‚Äì and employing the greatest French actors of the period. On 4 April 1946, Pagnol was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, taking his seat in March 1947, the first filmmaker to receive this honour. = Themes of Pagnol's films = In his films, Pagnol transfers his playwriting talents onto the big screen. His editing style is somberly reserved, placing emphasis on the content of an image. As a pictorial naturalist, Pagnol relies on film as art to convey a deeper meaning rather than solely as a tool to tell a story. Pagnol also took great care in the type of actors he employed, hiring local actors to appear in his films to highlight their unique accents and culture. Like his plays, Pagnol's films emphasize dialogue and musicality. The themes of many of Pagnol's films revolve around the acute observation of social rituals. Using interchangeable symbols and recurring character roles, such as proud fathers and rebellious children, Pagnol illuminates the provincial life of the lower class. Notably, Pagnol also frequently compares women and land, showing both can be barren or fertile. Above all, Pagnol uses all this to illustrate the importance of human bonds and their renewal. = As a novelist = In 1945, Pagnol remarried, to actress Jacqueline Pagnol. They had two children together, Fr√©d√©ric (born 1946) and Estelle (born 1949). Estelle died at the age of two. Pagnol was so devastated that he fled the south and returned to live in Paris. He went back to writing plays, but after his next piece was badly received he decided to change his job once more and began writing a series of autobiographical novels ‚Äì Souvenirs d'enfance ‚Äì based on his childhood experiences. In 1957, the first two novels in the series, La Gloire de mon p√®re and Le ch√¢teau de ma m√®re were published to instant acclaim. The third Le Temps des secrets was published in 1959, the fourth Le Temps des Amours was to remain unfinished and was not published until 1977, after his death. In the meantime, Pagnol turned to a second series, L'Eau des Collines ‚Äì Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources ‚Äì which focused on the machinations of Proven√ßal peasant life at the beginning of the twentieth century and were published in 1962. Pagnol adapted his own film Manon des Sources, with his wife Jacqueline in the title role, into two novels, Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources, collectively titled L'Eau des Collines. Death Marcel Pagnol died in Paris on 18 April 1974. He is buried in Marseille at the cemetery La Treille, along with his mother, father, brothers, and wife. His boyhood friend, David Magnan (Lili des Bellons in the autobiographies), died at the Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918, and is buried nearby.  Translations  Pagnol was also known for his translations of Shakespeare (from English) and Virgil (from Latin): *1944 : Le Songe d'une nuit d'√©t√© (A Midsummer Night's Dream) by William Shakespeare, first presented in 1947, at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Monaco; Paris, ≈íuvres compl√®tes, Club de l'Honn√™te Homme, 1971 *1947 : Hamlet by William Shakespeare, Paris, Nagel *1958 : Bucoliques (The Eclogues) by Virgil, Paris, Grasset Pagnol's Hamlet is still performed in France, although some have criticized his portrayal of Hamlet as somewhat effeminate.Maurois, Andr√©. Pagnol et Shakespeare, Op√©ra, 1948  Film adaptations  In 1986, Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources were remade by filmmaker Claude Berri. In 1990, La Gloire de mon p√®re and Le ch√¢teau de ma m√®re, Pagnol's affectionate reminiscences of childhood, were filmed by Yves Robert. In 2000, Jacques Nahum produced Marius, Fanny, and C√©sar for French television. In 2011, La Fille du puisatier was filmed by Daniel Auteuil. In 2013, Marius and Fanny were remade by Daniel Auteuil.

Bundeena is located 29 km south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. Bundeena is adjacent to the village of Maianbar and lies on the southern side of Port Hacking, opposite the suburbs of Cronulla and Burraneer. The village is surrounded by the Royal National Park. The beaches at Bundeena are Jibbon Beach, Gunyah Beach, Horderns Beach and Bonnie Vale Beach. Cabbage Tree Creek and 'The Basin' separate Bundeena from the smaller village of Maianbar. A bush track and footbridge link the two villages. Bonnie Vale is also one of the few camp grounds within the Royal National Park. Transport Passenger ferry from Cronulla Bundeena may be reached by passenger ferry from Cronulla or by road through the Royal National Park from Sutherland or Waterfall. Cronulla and National Park Ferry Cruises provides regular ferry services between Cronulla and Bundeena. The wharf at Cronulla is located on Gunnamatta Bay, near Cronulla railway station. Ferry trips vary from 20 to 30 minutes depending on the weather. Many people from Bundeena drive to the railway station at Sutherland, as it is only a 25-minute drive as opposed to 30 minutes by ferry to Cronulla and then a 15-minute train trip to Sutherland. Maianbar Bundeena Bus Service operates bus route 989 for local bus services between Bundeena and Maianbar on school days only. In addition there is one return trip every Wednesday to Engadine and one return trip every Friday to Miranda both via Maianbar. Environment During early colonial settlement, Indonesian rusa deer were introduced and have since become a large population in the area. Many residents see the deer as pests, but they are a protected species, although the National Parks & Wildlife Service are permitted a small yearly cull. However many residents also take delight in the deer, which causes much division and emotion in the affected townships.Refer article in the Sydney Morning Herald http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-deer- hunters/2007/12/20/1197740472554.html History Aerial image looking to the south-east. The three peninsulas, from left to right, are Yenabilli, Maianbar and Bundeena Bundeena is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"noise like thunder\\" (presumed to be a reference to the sound of the waves crashing on Horderns Beach). Aboriginal rock engravings made by Dharawal people can be found at Jibbon Head. Bass and Flinders investigated the area in 1796, deciding that it was not a suitable location for a settlement. In 1815 there were reports of criminals in the Cabbage Tree Creek region who were producing sly grog. They used the caves along the foreshore for storage. Bundeena's first authorised white settler, Owen Byrne, was granted land at the site in 1832. George Simpson received a land grant at the adjacent Bonnie Vale in 1863. Simpson's Hotel was opened in the area now known as Simpsons Bay by George's son, William, in the 1870s. The sandstone Simpson's House (1870s) is still standing at what is now Bonnie Vale Campground. A wharf was built in 1890 and W.A. Hodgkinson conducted a launch service from Gunnamatta Bay in 1908. Captain R.R. Ryall commenced the Cronulla to Bundeena ferry service in 1915. The Wharf was reconstructed in 1920. The district's first store commenced operations at the beginning of the 1930s.

In 1991, he joined the then-newly created civilian Philippine National Police, or PNP, formed as a result of the merger of the military Philippine Constabulary and the civilian Integrated National Police or INP. (The INP was formed in 1975 as an integration of all local police forces in the country then under operational control of the PC.) Soon Lacson became Provincial Director of the Province of Laguna from February to July 1992. Afterwards, he was appointed Chief of Task Force Habagat at the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission from 1992 to 1995. From 1996 to April 1997, he was given the task of project officer of \\"Special Project Alpha.\\" Lacson was appointed Chief of the PNP on November 18, 1999. = Anti-Kidnap Achievements and No-Take Policy = While serving in the Philippine Constabulary's Metropolitan Command, Lacson solving crimes, including kidnap- for-ransom incidents. In 1981, Lacson was a Lieutenant Colonel with the PC- Metrocom, when he led a team that rescued now-tycoon Robina Gokongwei-Pe, daughter of businessman John Gokongwei Jr., from a kidnap-for-ransom gang. Robina's family offered Lacson and his team a reward, but Lacson declined it, as part of his no-take policy. Lacson explained he does not want his men to have the mentality of not helping ‚Äúgusgusin‚Äù (poor) complainants who may not afford to give them a reward. The Gokongweis eventually decided to show their gratitude by donating mobile patrol vehicles to the PC, coursing it through then PC chief Maj. Gen. Fidel Ramos. In a Twitter post, Lacson recalled advising the elder Gokongwei not to sound intimidated while negotiating with the kidnappers. He said that after Robina's rescue, the elder Gokongwei offered P400,000 as reward money, which he declined. Instead, Gokongwei donated 10 mobile cars to the PC Metrocom. Robina recounted details of the incident in her eulogy to her father. Lacson, who would later head the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001, founded the PNP Foundation in 2000, as a way for civic-minded people to give contributions for the benefit of the PNP as an institution. During his stint in Cebu, Lacson rescued the scion of a Cebu-based retail magnate. The victim's family intended to give the money they prepared as ransom to Lacson and his operatives as a reward, but Lacson declined it. Lacson was said to have told the victim's family that a mere \\"thank you\\" was more than enough for him. In 1992, Lacson was recruited to the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission chaired by then Vice President Joseph Estrada. Lacson headed the PACC's Task Force Habagat, which would go on to solve several kidnap-for-ransom cases. = Anti-Jueteng Campaign = Aside from kidnap-for-ransom gangs, jueteng and other forms of illegal gambling were also in Lacson's sights when he was in the PC, and eventually in the Philippine National Police. In 1992, he bared an attempt by local jueteng operators in Laguna to bribe him, initially to the tune of P1.2 million a month. He rejected the offer. Lacson maintained an all-out effort against jueteng, even if in the process he crossed paths with eventual President Joseph Estrada. = Chief, PNP (1999-2001) = As Chief PNP, Lacson eliminated the ‚ÄúKotong culture‚Äù among the police officers. He rationalized the distribution of financial and logistical resources by downloading 85 percent to the police frontline units, retaining only 15 percent in the police headquarters. He imposed a strict physical fitness test on all PNP members, invoking a 34-inch maximum waistline for police officers. Lacson refused to accept bribe money from illegal gambling operators and contractors and suppliers transacting business with the PNP, declining offers of monetary rewards from kidnap-for-ransom victims after rescuing them from their captors. Under Lacson's leadership, the PNP achieved a 58% public approval rating, while Lacson got a 78% approval rating for himself. = Kuratong Baleleng Case = The Kuratong Baleleng of the 1990s was a criminal gang linked to a series of violent crimes that included kidnappings and bank robberies. In some of the robberies, the gang's members would gun down security guards and innocent bystanders. In 1995, members of a composite task group assigned to stop robberies in Metro Manila were linked to the killing of 11 members of Kuratong Baleleng in Quezon City. The PACC was a part of the composite task force. In 2003, the High Tribunal ordered the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to try the case against Lacson and 33 other police officials. The trial court dismissed the criminal case, finding absence of probable cause. The special prosecuting team later moved for new trial before the High Tribunal to remand case to the trial court to present new evidence against Senator Lacson, inter alia. On May 2, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines resolved to take cognizance of the motion of the families of the slain Kuratong Baleleng members for revival of the murder case against police officials and Senator Panfilo Lacson.gmanews.tv/story, SC defers action on revival of Kuratong case On November 13, 2012, the Supreme Court in an en banc decision denied the government's motion to revive the case and affirmed the lower court's decision dismissing it. =Dacer‚ÄìCorbito Murder Case= On November 24, 2000, publicist Salvador ‚ÄúBubby‚Äù Dacer and his driver Emmanuel Corbito were abducted in Makati City.

Political career =Estrada Cabinet= Lacson was appointed by then President Joseph Estrada to head the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) and to serve as Philippine National Police Chief. Lacson's notable accomplishments were the reduction of corrupt policemen (Kotong Cops) and various organized crime syndicates engaged in kidnapping, drug trafficking, and other illegal activities. From April 30 to May 1, 2001, together with Juan Ponce Enrile, Gregorio Honasan, Miriam Defensor Santiago and Tito Sotto, he led the EDSA III protests against Gloria M. Arroyo. On May 1, 2001, the protesters stormed Malaca√±ang Palace. = First 2 Senate terms (2001-2007, 2007-2013) = Lacson at Camp Crame in 2019 Lacson ran for senator in the 2001 elections under the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), which was affiliated with Estrada's Puwersa ng Masa coalition. He won a seat in the Senate, finishing in tenth place. In late 2006, Lacson said he might run as mayor of the city of Manila in the 2007 midterm elections. However, he rescinded that decision and instead ran for a second Senate term under the Genuine Opposition coalition. He won reelection in the 2007 senatorial elections senatorial elections, ranking third. On March 11, 2003, Lacson delivered a speech entitled Living Without Pork, exposing the evils and temptations presented by the pork barrel system, and called for its total abolition. During deliberations on the national budget, he stated he would make sure his PDAF allocation reverted to the National Treasury ‚Äì in the process saving the government some PhP2.4 billion during his first 12 years in the Senate. Lacson's advocacy against the pork barrel system and the corruption associated with him was cited by the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila when it conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, on March 27, 2019. Lacson filed bills that aimed to improve public service, enhance reproductive health, promote investments, bolster the country's defense capabilities, He was one of the main authors of two legislative measures of the Aquino administration, one of which was the Reproductive Health Act. The measure seeks to promote responsible parenthood and to protect the health of the mother and child by giving them access to reproductive health services. President Benigno Aquino III certified the bill as urgent, allowing Congress to pass it quickly. President Aquino signed it into law as Republic Act 10354 in December 2012. Another legislative measure where Lacson was a main author was the Sin Tax Reform Act, which imposes higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol products to deter the public from buying such products. Those who buy such products will have to pay higher taxes, whose proceeds will go to the government's universal health program. For the Sin Tax Reform Act, Lacson had filed Senate Bill No. 2763, which sought to restructure the excise tax on alcohol products; and Senate Bill No. 2764, which sought to restructure the excise tax on tobacco products. President Aquino signed the bill into law as Republic Act 10351. Lacson authored Senate Bill No. 2783, which strengthened further the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001. His work is now part of Republic Act No. 10167, which was approved and signed into law on June 18, 2012. Lacson authored an amendment to the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Act, which aims to provide more funds to the military. President Aquino signed the measure as Republic Act 10349 on December 11, 2012. Lacson filed Senate Bill No. 2993, An Act Providing for a comprehensive law on firearms, light weapons and ammunitions, which was signed into law as Republic Act 10591. Lacson authored the law converting Imus, Cavite from a municipality into a city. The measure became Republic Act No. 10161 on May 8, 2012. Lacson filed Senate Bill No. 2945, which reapportioned the province of Cotabato into three legislative districts. The bill was passed into law as Republic Act 10177. He filed resolutions that led to many officials being held accountable, whether incumbent or former. Among these were: * Resolution No. 518: Directing the Blue Ribbon Committee to look into the alleged anomalous acquisition by the Philippine National Police of light operational helicopters in 2009. The resolution triggered an investigation that led to the filing of criminal charges against the officials and personalities linked to the questionable purchase. Some of them were dismissed from the service. * Resolution No. 519: Directing the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee to look into corruption by the previous board of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. Many of the officials linked to the irregularity ‚Äì including former president Gloria Arroyo ‚Äì have been charged before the graft court. * Resolution No. 537: Directing the Blue Ribbon Committee to investigate electoral sabotage in the 2004 and 2007 elections, which triggered the charges that led to the arrest and detention of former officials, including former president Gloria Arroyo. Another resolution, Resolution No. 660, seeks to congratulate new Cardinal and Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle. Lacson filed resolutions commending members of the police and military for safeguarding Filipinos, including: * Resolution No. 542: Resolution honoring The Outstanding Philippine Soldiers (TOPS) of 2011 * Resolution No. 562: Resolution commending the Country's Outstanding Policemen in Service (COPS) of 2011 As fiscalizer in the Senate, Lacson initiated the investigation of the following: * IMPSA investigation ‚Äì 2002 * Jose Pidal investigation ‚Äì 2003 * Jueteng investigation ‚Äì 2005 * Textbook Scam investigation ‚Äì 2006 ‚Äì 2007 * Flight of Filipino nurses recruited by Sentosa Recruitment Agency ‚Äì 2007 * Alleged bribery in the failed impeachment bid against President Arroyo ‚Äì 2007 * Overpricing in the decorative lampposts used in the Asean summit in Cebu City ‚Äì 2007 * Irregularities in the multibillion-peso Quedancor swine program ‚Äì 2008 * Plan by the Social Security System to channel workers‚Äô pension funds into a government economic stimulus program ‚Äì 2009 * Alleged irregularities in the purchase of video equipment for the Senate's Public Relations and Information Bureau ‚Äì 2009 =Presidential Bid, 2004= Lacson ran for President in the 2004 general election against the incumbent president, Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo.

His office crafted the Yolanda Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan (CRRP) with a PhP167 billion proposed funding, which provides for an overall strategic vision and integrated short-term, medium-term and long-term programs in the Yolanda-affected areas. Lacson's efforts in the Yolanda rehabilitation led to the institutionalization of certain mechanisms on rehabilitation of calamity- affected communities. In December 2014, Lacson tendered his irrevocable resignation as PARR which took effect in February 2015. He recommended the transition of his office's accomplishments and best practices to a permanent government agency. Lacson viewed the scheduled sunset review of Republic Act 10121, otherwise known as ‚ÄúPhilippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010‚Äù, as an opportune time to propose possible remedial measures that will help improve the effectiveness of the law, especially on the aspect of disaster rehabilitation and recovery. Lacson pointed out that while his mandate as PARR was to develop a rehabilitation plan, he had no authority to implement or manage funds. =Return to the Senate (2016-present)= Lacson originally planned to run for president in the 2016 election.GMA News.

Commission on Elections en banc sitting as the National Board of Canvassers. May 19, 2016. In the 17th Congress, Lacson filed Senate Bill 41, the National Reference Act of 2016, which seeks to establish a National ID system that can help government law enforcers deter criminality and terrorism by facilitating the processes of apprehension and prosecution. The system seeks to address the problems of constant delays and inconveniences in availing of basic public services and social security benefits due to inefficient and unreliable means of identifying the beneficiaries. The bill was signed into law as RA 11055 in late 2018. Lacson filed Senate Bill 42, penalizing a wide range of crimes ranging from drug- related offenses to treason, terrorism, and human trafficking. Lacson filed Senate Bill 48, which seeks to amend Republic Act 4200 to update the list of crimes where wiretapping may be deemed lawful under certain circumstances. The measure may give law enforcers more teeth against crimes like drugs, money- laundering and coups. On October 19, 2016, Lacson sponsored Senate Bill 1210, the proposed Expanded Anti-Wiretapping Act of 2016. Other bills filed by Lacson include: * Senate Bill 258, which offers substantial rewards and better protection to witnesses in exchange for coming out and testifying against government officials or employees involved in corruption. * Senate Bill 1025, which strips drug pushers, manufacturers, cultivators, importers and financiers of their rights under the Bank Secrecy Act, so they can no longer hide their ill-gotten money in banks. Lacson filed bills to ensure professionalism among law enforcers, including: * Senate Bills 255 and 266, which provide added benefits to barangay tanods and captains. * Senate Bill 260, which provides for special financial assistance for families or beneficiaries of police and military personnel, jail officers and firefighters killed or incapacitated in the line of duty. * Senate Bill 971, which provides guidelines on the selection of provincial commanders and city and town chiefs of police. * Senate Bill 1052, which seeks to restore subpoena powers to the PNP's CIDG. This was signed into law as RA 10973. * Senate Bill 1310, which gives the Philippine National Police's Internal Affairs Service more teeth to curb abuses and further enhance discipline in the police agency. He filed bills seeking to streamline or update the operations of government agencies, including: * Senate Bill 1470, which updates the charter of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office to help it keep up with new variations of lotteries and make it more accountable. * Senate Bill 1471, which addresses Pagcor's \\"conflicting\\" roles of regulating and operating gambling casinos by having the agency focus on regulating the industry and giving up its role as operator of such establishments. But Lacson went after abusive law enforcers, including some rogue cops who took advantage of the government's anti-drug war. At a Senate hearing on January 28, 2017, the former Lacson showed a video of police officers in civilian clothing, appearing to plant evidence in an anti-drug operation ‚Äì to stress his call for internal cleansing in the PNP. In the 18th Congress, Lacson filed Senate Bill 23, the Budget Reform for Village Empowerment Act of 2016. The bill seeks to give local government units an active role in nation building by providing them with funding for development projects. Lacson re-filed in the 18th Congress his bills on anti-terrorism (Senate Bill 21) and anti-wiretapping (Senate Bill 22). Of the two, the Anti- Terrorism bill became part of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 3, 2020. Other bills Lacson re-filed included: *Senate Bill 24, which encourages people's participation in deliberations on the national budget to prevent pork. * Senate Bill 25, which requires registration of prepaid SIM cards to prevent scams and crimes involving identity theft. * Senate Bill 26, which excludes government employees, including the President, from protection of the Philippine Bank Secrecy Act. * Senate Bill 27, which reimposes the death penalty on heinous crimes. *Senate Bill 28, which imposes heavier penalties on false testimonies. *Senate Bill 29, which assures that parents who enter their twilight years will get support from their children. *Senate Bill 30, the proposed Anti- Political Dynasty Act. *Senate Bill 246, the Real Property Valuation and Assessment Reform Act. *Senate Bill 247, the Anti-Contraband in Prison Act of 2019. *Senate Bill 248, Whistleblower Act of 2019. *Senate Bill 249, The National Defense Act of 2019. *Senate Bill 250, The Land Administration Reform Act of 2019. *Senate Bill 251, The Local Government Units‚Äô Income Classification Act of 2019. *Senate Bill 252, Additional Barangay Captains‚Äô Insurance Act of 2019. *Senate Bill 253, Upgrading the Benefits and Incentives of Barangay Tanods. *Senate Bill 254, An Act Establishing the PAF Academy and Appropriating Funds Therefor. *Senate Bill 255, Exemptions in Requirements for Conversion of a Municipality into a Component City.  Anti-Pork Advocacy  In late 2016, Lacson discovered and moved to take out some P8.3 billion in \\"pork-like\\" insertions made by the House of Representatives. Lacson noted House members were allowed to identify P80 million worth of projects before the submission of the 2017 National Expenditure Program to Congress for deliberations ‚Äì the pork barrel system already declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. This prompted the Senate to realign P8.3 billion in the proposed 2017 national budget to cover tuition of students in state colleges and universities. For the 2019 budget, Lacson raised questions about the post- ratification tweaks made by the House leadership to the spending bill, saying this would violate the 1987 Constitution's Art. VI, Sec. 26, Paragraph 2: ‚ÄúUpon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto SHALL be allowed.‚Äù He also noted P72.319 billion was slashed from the DPWH's MFO 1 and 2, which covers the Duterte administration's ‚ÄúBuild Build Build‚Äù program. The projects under the MFO (Major Final Output) had already been planned and vetted. Meanwhile, in the proposed 2020 budget, Lacson cited information from some House members of a plan to give each district P700 million, and each of 22 deputy Speakers P1.5 billion. The plan was eventually scrapped. Lacson's revelations prompted some House members to demand an apology from Lacson, but Lacson said there is nothing to apologize for, as he is guarding the budget. House members demanded that he named his sources, but Lacson refused, saying he gets more information because he protects his sources. Lacson said such complaints will not distract him from scrutinizing the 2020 budget bill.  Exposing \\"Tara (payoffs)\\" System at the Bureau of Customs  On August 23, 2017, Lacson delivered a privilege speech at the Senate, where he narrated details of corruption at the Bureau of Customs. This led to Faeldon being cited in contempt by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee after he refused to testify in the probe on illegal drugs. On September 28, Lacson filed charges against Faeldon and several others before the Office of the Ombudsman over rice smuggling in March 2017.  Detailing \\"Conflict of Interest\\" at the DOH, PhilHealth  In a privilege speech on July 29, 2019, Lacson detailed how the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) was spending beyond its means while its higher-ups \\"seem to turn a blind eye.\\" He said this was due partly to the new reimbursement rates where PhilHealth \\"pays per case and not by actual expenses.\\" Lacson also bared WellMed, a company suspended for making fake benefit claims, was still receiving payments from PhilHealth. Also, Lacson said the family of Health Secretary and ex-oficio PhilHealth chairman Francisco Duque III had entered into a lease agreement with PhilHealth's Region 1 office where the agency rented the building owned by the Duque family's EMDC in Dagupan City. Lacson said a General Information Sheet of EMDC showed Secretary Duque was among the stockholders of the company, thus indicating a conflict of interest. In addition, Lacson said Doctors Pharmaceuticals Inc., a company owned by Secretary Duque's relatives, bids for government contracts with the DOH. The company was found in 2015 by the Food and Drug Administration of manufacturing for other companies, and was slapped a cease-and-desist order in June 2015. The FDA also ordered the recall of all drug products, but a tip that prompted an FDA inspection showed the firm was still operating. The FDA also found non-conformance with Good Manufacturing Practice. The revelations triggered separate investigations by Malacanang and the Senate. Malacanang said that while Secretary Duque, who denied the allegations, still enjoys President Rodrigo Duterte's trust, it will not stop him from attending the congressional investigations.  \\"Designated Survivor\\" Bill  On August 28, 2019, Lacson filed Senate Bill 982, an \\"Act Prescribing the Order of Presidential Succession.\\" The bill was also known as the \\"Designated Survivor\\" bill due to its similarity to the US and Korean shows that featured a designated official being kept in a safe, remote area to act as president should the President and his/her successors be killed or incapacitated in a terrorist attack or major calamity. Lacson confirmed he drew inspiration from the Netflix show.  Proposed Philippine Building Act  In the wake of recent quakes that hit Mindanao, Lacson filed Senate Bill 1239, updating the 1977 National Building Code. \\"Experience tells us that there is an urgent need to strengthen the overall policy on how buildings and structures are built in the country. Not to mention the country‚Äôs geographical location along the boundary of major tectonic plates and at the center of the typhoon belt, coupled by its socially and economically vulnerable population, it becomes even more imperative to review our four-decade-old National Building Code,\\" Lacson said.  R&D; Advocacy  Lacson pushed for bigger state investments in research and development, which he noted accounts for only 0.4 percent of the national budget from 2016 to 2020. To remedy this, he proposed increases in the R&D; budget of the Department of Science and Technology, including a P250M increase for the Office of the Secretary; P50M increase for the Science for Change Program: Niche Center in the Regions for Research and Development (NICER); P100M for the Space Technology and Applications Mastery, Innovation and Advancement (STAMINA4Space); and P100M for the Collaborative Research and Development to Leverage Philippine Economy (CRADLE) program. He reiterated the importance of research and development in March 2020, amid government preparations to deal with the COVID-19 threat.  Anti-Terrorism Law  Lacson is one of the authors and the sponsor in the Senate of what is now Republic Act 11479, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 3, 2020. The law replaces the Human Security Act of 2007 (RA 9372), which he noted became a dead-letter law as some of its provisions - including a P500,000 daily penalty for the wrongful detention of a suspected terrorist - discouraged law enforcers from using it to charge suspected terrorists. In more than 10 years in effect, the 2007 law resulted in just one conviction and just one proscribed terrorist organization such as the Abu Sayyaf Group, he added. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 fills the gaps in the 2007 law by making punishable inchoate offenses - Section 6 penalizes planning, training, preparing and facilitating the commission of terrorism - as well as providing the mechanism allowing the freezing of assets used to finance terrorism, but does not cover protests, mass actions and other actions covered in the Bill of Rights in the 1987 Constitution. In addressing claims the law could allow abuse, Lacson said there are safeguards such as 10-year jail terms and perpetual disqualification from public office for law enforcers who fail to comply with the requirement to report the arrest of a suspected terrorist to the nearest court and to the Commission on Human Rights. As such, he pointed out the law is \\"swift, effective and constitutional\\".  Laws authored, co-authored and/or sponsored by Lacson  = Free irrigation law for farmers (Republic Act 10969) = Shortly after assuming his Senate post in 2016, Lacson filed a bill providing free irrigation for farmers. The bill was consolidated in Senate Bill 1465, which along with House Bill 5670 were the basis for Republic Act 10969 ‚Äì the Free Irrigation Service Act ‚Äì which President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law on February 2, 2018. = Anti-hazing law (Republic Act 11053) = Lacson chaired a Senate committee investigation into the fatal hazing of law student Horacio \\"Atio\\" Castillo III in September 2017. The probe found indications of a cover-up attempt via Facebook chat by Aegis Jvris fraternity, the organization Castillo sought to join. The probe resulted in Senate Bill 1662, which updated the existing Anti-Hazing Act of 1995 by imposing heavier penalties on hazing. The bill passed third and final reading in the Senate on February 12, 2018. It also passed the bicameral conference committee on February 28, 2018. The bill finally became a law after President Rodrigo Duterte signed it on June 29, 2018. Under the new law, the definition of hazing was expanded to include ‚Äúphysical or psychological suffering, harm or injury inflicted on a recruit, member, neophyte, or applicant‚Äù as a prerequisite for admission or for continued membership in an organization. Banned under the law are ‚Äúall forms of hazing‚Äù not only in fraternities, sororities or organizations in schools, but also those in communities and even businesses and uniformed service learning institutions. The law also requires schools to be ‚Äúmore active and proactive‚Äù in regulating school-based initiation rites, with schools required to exercise reasonable supervision and take proactive steps to protect students from danger of participating in activities that will involve hazing. Penalties include imprisonment of up to 40 years and fines of up to PHP3 million. = Anti-crime laws = Lacson filed several anti-crime bills that were passed into law, including: * Amendment to the Anti-Money Laundering Act to include casinos as covered persons. It was signed into law as Republic Act 10927. Lacson also primarily authored Republic Act 9194, the Anti-Money Laundering Act. * Restoration of subpoena powers to the PNP-CIDG. The bill was signed into law as Republic Act 10973. * A retirement and benefits system for the Office of the Ombudsman, which is part of what is now Republic Act 11059. * Transferring the training of police recruits to the PNP, signed into law as Republic Act 11279. = National ID law (Republic Act 11055) = Lacson sponsored the bill seeking to establish a National ID system in the Philippines. In his sponsorship speech, Lacson said the National ID system seeks to harmonize, integrate and interconnect the \\"countless and redundant\\" government-issued ID cards. The proposed measure ‚Äì Senate Bill 1738 ‚Äì was approved in the Senate with a vote of 17‚Äì2 on March 19, 2018. On August 6, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the National ID measure into law, as Republic Act 11055. Lacson, the principal sponsor of the measure and a perennial author since 2001, expressed thanks to Duterte, as it was under his term that the national ID system saw the light of day. = PNP rank classification law (Republic Act 11200) = On February 8, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law Republic Act 11200, which provides for a rank classification in the Philippine National Police. Lacson said the new law, where he is the principal author and sponsor, eliminates confusion on how PNP officers must be addressed, but more importantly, \\"allows for better coordination between the PNP and other law enforcement units in countering terrorism and other threats to national security.\\" He added: \\"We cannot afford any delay in coordination in counter-terrorism operations and operations against other threats to national security.\\" Under the new law, the PNP's rank classification shall be as follows: * Director-General to Police General * Deputy Director-General to Police Lieutenant General * Director to Police Major General * Chief Superintendent to Police Brigadier General * Senior Superintendent to Police Colonel * Superintendent to Police Lieutenant Colonel * Chief Inspector to Police Major * Senior Inspector to Police Captain * Inspector to Police Lieutenant * SPO4 to Police Executive Master Sergeant * SPO3 to Police Chief Master Sergeant * SPO2 to Police Senior Master Sergeant * SPO1 to Police Master Sergeant * PO3 to Police Staff Sergeant * PO2 to Police Corporal * PO1 to Patrolman/Patrolwoman = Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 (Republic Act 11479) = Lacson sponsored in the Senate what is now The Anti- Terrorism Act of 2020 (Republic Act 11479). In his sponsorship speech for the measure in October 2019, Lacson said the country needs \\"a legal framework for anti-terrorism that is clear, concise, balanced, and rational.\\" He added the 2007 Human Security Act - which the 2020 anti-terror law replaced - had become a dead-letter law, with only one conviction in the more than 10 years it was in effect. Also, Lacson pointed out the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 fills the gaps in the 2007 law by making punishable inchoate offenses - Section 6 penalizes planning, training, preparing and facilitating the commission of terrorism - as well as providing the mechanism allowing the freezing of assets used to finance terrorism. But he stressed the law is not meant to stifle dissent as claimed by some groups, as Section 4 makes clear it does not cover advocacy, protest, dissent, stoppage of work, industrial or mass action, and other similar exercises of civil and political rights that are not intended to cause death or serious physical harm to a person, to endanger a person's life, or to create a serious risk to public safety. Lacson said he is ready to closely monitor and call out potential abuses in the implementation of the law, adding he will not allow anyone to pervert the legislative intent of the measure that he had painstakingly sponsored on the Senate floor. He noted the bill had gone through the gauntlet in the legislative branch, with its provisions earning the nod of constitutionalists and legal heavyweights in both houses of Congress. = Other laws = Lacson also primarily authored: *Republic Act No. 9163, The National Service Training Program (NSTP) Act of 2001 *Republic Act No. 9166, An Act Increasing the Base Pay of the members of the AFP *Republic Act No. 9208, The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003 *Republic Act No. 9416, Anti-Cheating Act of 2007 *Republic Act No. 9484, The Philippine Dental Act of 2007 *Republic Act No. 9485, Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007 He was also one of the co-authors of the following laws: *Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 *Republic Act No. 9189, otherwise known as the Absentee Voting Act *Republic Act No. 9287, otherwise known as the Anti-Jueteng and Illegal Numbers Game *Republic Act No. 9406, An Act Reorganizing the Public Attorney's Office Personal life Lacson is married to Alice de Perio and he had 4 children including his son Panfilo \\"Pampi\\" Lacson Jr., who has a son with actress Jodi Santamaria.

He was the standard-bearer of Aksyon Demokratiko, which he founded in 1997 as a vehicle for his presidential bids in 1998 and 2004. He was a former senator and Secretary of the Department of Education under the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He had a strong following among young voters in the Philippines due to his efforts to promote honesty and good governance. Roco was married to Sonia Cubillo Malasarte, who is from Bohol. They have six children (Robbie Pierre, Raul Jr., Sophia, Sareena, Rex and Synara) and seven grandchildren (Nica, Reece, Samantha, Shania, Santina, Beannie and RB). Early life and education Raul Roco was born in Naga City in the Philippine province of Camarines Sur, the son of farmer Sulpicio Azuela Roco and public school teacher Rosario Orlanda Sagarbarria. Roco finished elementary school at age 12 from Naga Parochial School, and high school at age 16 from Ateneo de Naga. He graduated magna cum laude from San Beda College (now San Beda University) in Manila with a degree in English at the age of 20. Then, he was also the Editor-in-Chief of The Bedan working with the likes of Rene Saguisag and Jaime Licauco. Later, Roco received a Bachelor of Laws degree (also at San Beda College) and was the college's Abbott Awardee for Over-All Excellence. In the United States, he obtained his Master of Laws at the University of Pennsylvania, while also enrolled at the Wharton School. He was the president of the National Union of Students of the Philippines in 1961 and was named one of the Ten Outstanding Students of the Philippines in 1964. His wife Sonia was the Most Outstanding Student that same year. As a result of his various other achievements, he had been awarded seven honorary doctorates. Political/professional career After he passed the bar in 1965, Roco lobbied for the holding of a Constitutional Convention that aimed to amend the 1935 Philippine Constitution. He campaigned for a seat to represent his district in Camarines Sur. He won and thus became convention's youngest Bicolano delegate. From 1983 to 1985, he served as president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. While there, he was on the legal staff of the late Philippine Senator Benigno \\"Ninoy\\" Aquino, and he drafted the Study Now, Pay Later law. Alongside his work in law, he has also served as a film producer. In 1974, he was the executive producer of the late film director Lino Brocka's movie Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang; this film won six FAMAS awards that year, including best film. Among all legislators of the Eighth Congress of the Philippines (which lasted from 1987‚Äì1992), he was adjudged by the Ford Foundation and the University of the Philippines Institute of Strategic and Development Studies as first in over-all performance. =Senate= Roco was elected to the Senate in 1992 and 1995 serving until 2001, making many contributions that led many to recognize him as an \\"outstanding senator\\". He wrote the law which reformed the nation's banking system; this earned him the title \\"Father of the Bangko Sentral\\". Some other laws that he wrote resulted in the liberalization of the banking industry and the strengthening of the thrift banks. In addition, he wrote the Intellectual Property Code and the Securities Regulation Code. Roco has also made several contributions to education in the Philippines. He helped fund the teachers' cooperatives as well as the increment mandated by the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers for retiring public school teachers. On the students' side, he helped bring computers into Philippine universities, colleges, and public schools. In addition, he devised a plan for meal scholarships for poor students at the Philippine Normal University. Roco wrote several bills targeted at protecting and prioritizing women in the Philippines. He wrote the Women in Nation Building Law, the Nursing Act, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law, the Anti-Rape Law, and the Child and Family Courts Act. He also let women play major roles in the Department of Education‚Äôs literacy program. Out of thanks to his services for women, many women's groups named him an \\"Honorary Woman\\". He also drafted a bill that abolished double taxation on Filipinos working abroad. He was given the Bantay Katarungan award by Kilosbayan for playing an integral role in the Senate impeachment trial of then-president Joseph Estrada who was impeached by the House of Representatives on 2000 for graft and corruption, bribery, betrayal of public trust, and culpable violation of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Unfortunately, the impeachment trial was not concluded and in 2001, Estrada was ousted from power by another People Power uprising. =As Secretary of Education= Roco took over as education secretary of the Philippines in 2001, at a time when the Philippines had not only one of the ten most corrupt governments in the world (according to Transparency International), but its Department of Education was also the fourth-most corrupt of its agencies (as named by the Asia Foundation - Social Weather Stations Survey of Enterprises on Public Sector Corruption). To combat this corruption, Roco imposed a department-wide transparency policy which also held employees accountable for the purchase of textbooks, which had been a major source of the department's corruption. This allowed the department to purchase textbooks for a much lower price, and after just eight months under Roco's leadership, the Department of Education gained a 73% public approval rating and became the most trusted government agency in the Philippines. During his tenure in that position, Roco allowed free public education (through high school) as required by the Philippine Constitution. He also enacted a reform of basic education curriculum in order that children would focus their studies on reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and Makabayan. In addition, he made sure that teachers were paid promptly and ended the 3% \\"service fee\\" that the department had long been deducting from teachers' pay. Candidacy for President =1998= Roco ran for president in the 1998 Philippine election. He lost to Vice-President Joseph Estrada but had a remarkable showing in a field of eleven candidates despite being an independent candidate. His strong showing was attributed to the widespread support he received from young Filipinos who eventually formed his party, Aksyon Demokratiko, and its youth arm, Aksyon Kabataan. Party leaders then included Jaime Galvez Tan, Lorna Patajo-Kapunan and Darwin Mariano. =2004= Roco rode his success in the Department of Education into a run for the Philippine presidency. His candidacy was based on his ability to fight corruption and to display fair play, decency, and honor. His Aksyon Demokratiko party formed a coalition with Promdi and Reporma, the parties of 1998 presidential candidates Lito Osme√±a and Renato de Villa, to form the Alyansa ng Pag-asa (Alliance of Hope). Roco was a front-runner in pre-election surveys and was considered a strong contender. However, during the campaign, he battled with recurrence of his cancer, after remission from his bout with prostate cancer in 1996. His illness forced him to leave the campaign trail for medical attention in the United States. Doctors told him that his condition was not life-threatening and that he could continue his run for the presidency. He returned to the campaign trail, but concerns about his illness greatly diminished his support. He lost the election to the incumbent, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, and finished fourth in a field of 5 candidates. He was the President of Aksyon Demokratiko until his death. Death On 5 August 2005, Raul Roco died of prostate cancer, at St Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City. He was buried on August 11 in Naga City, Camarines Sur. showbizandstyle.inquirer.net, What‚Äôs Sonia Roco up to? His widow, Sonia, lost her bid for Senator under the Genuine Opposition (formerly United Opposition) umbrella in the May 14, 2007 midterm elections. She still represents the party he started, Aksyon Demokratiko, in the hope of continuing the advocacies that her late husband had started.

These suburbs include Taren Point to the north on the Georges River, and Port Hacking, Lilli Pilli, Dolans Bay and Caringbah South, located on the Port Hacking River to the south. History Caringbah is an Aboriginal word from the Kumbainggar language for a pademelon wallaby. The suburb was originally called Highfield, but it is unclear whether this was a position description or whether it was named after an early resident. Caringbah was used from 1911, after the steam trams began operating between Cronulla and Sutherland.Caringbah Lions Club Caringbah Lions Club Thomas Holt (1811‚Äì88) owned most of the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla in the 1860s.

It is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. The Circular Quay area is a popular neighbourhood for tourism and consists of walkways, pedestrian malls, parks and restaurants. It hosts a number of ferry quays, bus stops, and a railway station. Often referred to as the \\"gateway to Sydney\\", the precinct has views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House and is a common location for viewing Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks. History =Indigenous history= The native name for Circular Quay was Warrung meaning 'Little Child. Also used to be called semi circular quay. The first people to occupy the area now known as Sydney were Australian Aborigines. Radiocarbon dating suggests that they lived in and around Sydney for at least 30,000 years. In an archaeological dig in Parramatta, Western Sydney, it was found that the Aboriginals used charcoal, stone tools and possible ancient campfires. Near Penrith, a far western suburb of Sydney, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments having dates of 45,000 to 50,000 years BP. This would mean that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier than thought. Prior to the arrival of the British there were 4,000 to 8,000 native people in the Sydney area from as many as 29 different clans. Sydney Cove from Port Jackson to Petersham was inhabited by the Cadigal clan. The principal language groups were Darug, Guringai, and Dharawal. The earliest Europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing, using trees for bark and food, collecting shells, and cooking fish. The \\"Eora people\\" are the coastal Aborigines of the Sydney district. The name Eora simply means \\"here\\" or \\"from this place\\", and was used by Local Aboriginal people to describe to the British where they came from. The Cadigal band are the traditional owners of the Sydney CBD area, and their territory south of Port Jackson stretches from South Head to Petersham. =Colonial settlement= View east across Sydney Cove (Circular Quay) (c. 1841) Sydney Cove, on which Circular Quay is located, was the site of the initial landing of the First Fleet in Port Jackson on 26 January 1788. The governor's temporary canvas house was erected on the east side of the cove, while the western shore became the centre of the early settlement. It was the focal point from which the city of Sydney grew. The first wharf on the shore of Sydney Cove probably dated from around 1792. In 1802 it was replaced with a timber framed wharf called \\"Hospital Wharf\\", the first public wharf of the colony (later renamed King's Wharf and Queen's Wharf). Late 18th-century Scottish constitutional reformer Thomas Muir was sentenced to transportation to Sydney for sedition, and had a cottage on what is now Circular Quay. Thomas Muir escaped from the colony in 1796 aboard an American brig, the Otter. The eastern side of the cove remained largely uninhabited in the early years of the colony; one notable inhabitant was Bennelong, after whom the adjacent Bennelong Point and Bennelong Apartments are named. In the early 19th century, the entire eastern shore of Circular Quay was part of the Governor's Domain, though some commercial activity developed along the shoreline. The western shore, being adjacent to the original settlement now known as The Rocks, was busier. Cadman's Cottage is a building which survives from that era, built in 1816 for the use of the governmental coxswains and their crews, it marks approximately the location of Circular Quay's natural western shore, prior to reconstruction. The Commissariat Stores (built in 1809) and Australia's first naval dock were also located on the western shore. The naval dockyard was expanded in 1818-1822 under Governor Macquarie, with four repairing docks. =Working port= East Circular Quay in 1892, showing the \\"wool stores\\". Circular Quay was constructed in 1837-1844 by reconstructing the southern section of Sydney Cove with an artificial shoreline. The mouth of the Tank Stream, which flowed into Sydney Cove at the western end of Circular Quay, was in-filled. The harbour was originally known as \\"Semi-Circular Quay\\", this being the actual shape of the quay. The name was shortened for convenience. Wharves were built on the southern shore. Reflecting Circular Quay's status as the central harbour for Sydney, the Customs House was built on the southern shore in 1844-5. During the construction of Circular Quay, the eastern side of the cove was used as a quarry and housed construction works. After the governor's residence was moved up the hill to the present Government House in the 1840s and 1850s, Macquarie Street was extended north through the Governor's Domain to Fort Macquarie. This led to the development of the area between the street and the shore into a commercial working wharf dominated by the wool trade, while the eastern side of the street remained part of the Domain. This part of Macquarie Street became known as the \\"wool store\\" end. Wool and bond stores and warehouses appeared on the site. The historic \\"Moore Steps\\" was built in 1868 as a passage between two wool stores, leading from the shore to Macquarie Street. By the 1860s, all three sides of Circular Quay were dominated by wharves and warehouses. However, by the 1870s, much of the commercial shipping activities was moving away from Circular Quay. The harbour was becoming too small to accommodate the increasing number of large ships accessing Sydney. Instead, shipping activities moved further westwards to Darling Harbour, which also had the advantage of a railway line. With the absence of commercial shipping, the harbour became increasingly used for passenger transport. The first ferry wharf was built on the southern shore in 1879. From the 1890s, ferry terminals came to dominate the harbour, and Circular Quay became the hub of the Sydney ferry network. The Sydney Harbour Trust was formed in 1900. =Transport developments= The Cahill Expressway and railway viaduct under construction at Circular Quay. Circular Quay was also a tram hub. It was the focal terminal point of most electric tram services to the Eastern Suburbs. The first tram to operate through Circular Quay was horse-drawn, running from the old Sydney Railway station to Circular Quay along Pitt Street in 1861 allowing easy transfer to ferries. Trams operated from Central station down Castlereagh Street to Circular Quay and back up Pitt Street in a large anti-clockwise loop. For many years, 27 regular services operated from Circular Quay. From 1936, the appearance of Circular Quay was dramatically changed with the construction of a railway viaduct, and later the elevated Cahill Expressway above the viaduct, across the southern shore of the cove. The Circular Quay railway station was opened on 20 January 1956Circular Quay Railway Station and Viaduct NSW Environment & Heritage Retrieved 4 December 2014 and the elevated Cahill Expressway was officially opened on 24 March 1958. =Building developments= Circular Quay in 1963, viewed from the northeast. East Circular Quay waterfront in the early 21st century. The construction of the viaduct led to the demolition of the old Maritime Services Board building on the south-western shore. A replacement was constructed further north in 1940, and is today the Museum of Contemporary Art. Further north, the Sydney Cove Passenger Terminal was built in 1958-1960 to accommodate the increasing number of passengers arriving by ship. The building was renovated in 1988, 2000 and 2014. Large liners and cruise ships often dock here, their size dominating the cove. East Circular Quay was redeveloped from the 1950s with the replacement of wool stores with modernist commercial buildings. The Sydney height limit was increased from in 1959, and a number of Sydney's first skyscrapers were built around Circular Quay. The AMP Building on the southern shore was Sydney's tallest building when completed in 1962. In 1973 the Sydney Opera House was completed at the northeastern end of Sydney Cove. Between 1971 and 1989, Colonial Mutual Life acquired land along Circular Quay for a large scale development. The initial design caused significant controversy around the country, including intervention by the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and internationally. A revised 1992 design had the developer reducing building height and providing a colonnade for public access, in exchange for the development extending further towards the foreshore. The resulting development of Bennelong Apartments (nicknamed by critics as The Toaster), and is criticized for it positioning and for obscuring views of the Sydney Opera House, from the main pedestrian approach. In 2019, several property developments underway by the private sector in the area, including: Quay Quarter Sydney by AMP Capital, Opera Residences, One Circular Quay by Yuhu Group, Circular Quay Tower by Lendlease, and the Sandstone Hotels precinct by Pontiac Group. In addition, the Sydney Opera House is undergoing its largest renewal project since its opening. Transport Trams in Circular Quay (early 20th century) Circular Quay is a major Sydney transport hub, with a large ferry, rail and bus interchange. The Cahill Expressway is a prominent feature of the quay, running from the east, over the elevated railway station to join the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the west. International ships have docked and moored at Circular Quay since the earliest years of the colony. The Overseas Passenger Terminal, situated on the Quay, is a major piece of Sydney transport infrastructure serving cruise ships and ocean liners and their passengers. The railway station is the only station on the City Circle that is above ground. The platform looks out over the ferry terminus, providing views of Sydney Harbour, including the bridge and Opera House. The wharf complex hosts five commuter ferry wharves and is the terminus for all public ferry routes in Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River other than the Mortlake Ferry between Mortlake and Putney. View of Circular Quay from Sydney Cove with ship berthed at the Overseas Passenger Terminal Circular Quay was formerly a large tram terminus and interchange. As many Sydney bus routes follow the previous tram lines, the tram terminus in Alfred Street became a major bus terminus for many bus routes. A redesign of CBD bus services in October 2015 reduced the number of bus routes serving the Quay. In response to increasing bus congestion in the CBD, on 13 December 2012 the NSW Government announced a commitment to build a $1.6 billion light rail from Circular Quay down George Street to Central Station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade. South of Moore Park the line would split into two branches - one continuing down Anzac Parade to The Nine Ways at Kingsford, and the other heading to Randwick via Alison Road. Construction commenced in October 2015. This light rail system which became fully operational in April 2020, has a station located on the corner of Loftus Street, Circular Quay. Culture Circular Quay is a focal point for community celebrations, due to its central Sydney location between the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is one of the main congregation points for Sydney New Year's Eve. Circular Quay is also the home of Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art and the City of Sydney Library in the heritage-listed Customs House. Sydney Writers Walk - a series of plaques commemorating writers with some connection to Sydney - was installed in the footpath along Circular Quay in 1991. In autumn 2006, the largest open-air art exhibition ever in Australia took place on Circular Quay: Over 7 weeks the Berlin Buddy Bears visited Sydney.United Buddy Bears in Sydney 2006 Each bear represented a member- country of the United Nations, symbolizing the universal principles of peace, freedom and friendship.Messages of Greeting by John Howard The Quay is mentioned in the classic song \\"And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\\" (1971) by Eric Bogle. \\"Circular Quay\\" is the title of a song from Dr. Robert of The Blow Monkeys which appeared on his 1994 debut solo album, \\"Realms Of Gold\\". The song was also issued as a single in the same year.

Family and early life Thomas Graves was born circa 1747, the third son of Reverend John Graves of Castle Dawson, County Londonderry, by his wife Jane Hudson. He was a nephew of Admiral Samuel Graves and a first cousin once removed of Admiral Thomas, Lord Graves. Graves' three brothers all served as captains in the navy, becoming admirals on the superannuated list. Thomas entered the navy at a very early age, and served during the Seven Years' War with his uncle Samuel on board , Duke, and . After the peace he was appointed to with his cousin Thomas, whom he followed to , and by whom, in 1765, while on the coast of Africa, he was promoted to be lieutenant of . It is stated in Foster's Peerage that he was born in 1752, a date incompatible with the facts of his known service: by the Regulations of the Navy he was bound to be twenty years old at the date of his promotion, and though the order was often grossly infringed, it is highly improbable that he was only thirteen: it may fairly be assumed that he was at least eighteen in 1765. Arctic seas and North America In 1770 Graves was lieutenant of , and in 1773 was appointed to with Captain Constantine Phipps for the voyage of discovery in the Arctic Seas. In the following year he went out to North America with his uncle Samuel, and was appointed by him to command , one of the small schooners employed for the prevention of smuggling. She had thirty men, with an armament of four 2-pounder guns, and on 27 May 1775, being sent from Boston into the Charles River, was attacked by a large force of insurgents, whose numbers swelled till they reached a total of something like two thousand men, with two field- pieces. It fell calm, and towards midnight, as the tide ebbed, Diana ran aground, and lay over on her side, when the colonial forces succeeded in setting her on fire, and the small crew, after a gallant defence, were compelled to abandon her, Graves having been first severely burnt, as well as his brother John, then a lieutenant of the flagship , who had been sent in one of the Prestons boats to support Diana. BEATSON, Nav. and Mil. Mem. iv. 72 Promotion and further service After this Graves continued to be employed in command of other tenders in the neighbourhood of Boston and Rhode Island until, on the recall of his uncle, he rejoined Preston and returned to England; but was again sent out to the North American station in the same ship, commanded by Commodore William Hotham. In 1779 he was promoted to the command of the sloop on the West Indian and North American stations, and in May 1781 he was advanced to post rank. In the temporary absence of Commodore Edmund Affleck, he commanded in the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September, and continuing afterwards in Bedford, as Affleck's flag captain, was present in the engagement at St. Kitts on 26 January 1782, and in the Battle of the Saintes on 9 and 12 April, in which last Bedford had a very distinguished part. In the following autumn Graves was appointed to the frigate HMS Magicienne, in which, on 2 January 1783, he fought a very severe action with the French , which was encumbered with a second ship's company which she was carrying to the Chesapeake. Both frigates were reduced to a wreck, and so parted; Magicienne to get to Jamaica a fortnight later; Sybille to be captured on 22 January 1783 by Hussar under Thomas McNamara Russell. Years of peace and the French Revolutionary Wars During the peace Graves spent much of his time in France, and in the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars had no employment. It was not until October 1800 that he was appointed to command the 74-gun , in the Channel Fleet, under the orders of Lord St. Vincent. This was only for a few months; for on 1 January 1801 he was promoted to be Rear- Admiral of the White Squadron, and in March hoisted his flag on board the 64-gun , one of the fleet proceeding to the Baltic with Sir Hyde Parker. Flag rank and later life Graves afterwards shifted his flag to , and in her was third in command under Parker and Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. For his services on this important occasion he received the thanks of Parliament, and an appointment as Knight Commander of the Bath. Towards the end of July the fleet left the Baltic, and on its return to England Graves, who had been in very bad health during the greater part of the campaign, retired from active service. , captained for a time by Christopher Nesham, carried his flag in the Bay of Biscay from October 1804 to February 1805. He became a vice-admiral on 9 November 1805 and admiral on 2 August 1812. Personal life He was twice married, but had only one daughter. He died at his house, Woodbine Hill, near Honiton on 29 March 1814.

It is located south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. The postcode is 2226, which it shares with neighbouring suburbs Jannali, Bonnet Bay and Como West. The postal locality (suburb) of Como West was originally created in 1939 from within the greater Como locality, and is bounded to the west by the Woronora River. The shoreline across Como features Bonnet Bay, Scylla Bay and Carina Bay. History Well before it became Como, the locality had previously been known as Woronora. Circa early 1883, a small weatherboard and iron roofed building called the Woronora Hotel had been constructed by the proprietor, Mr Thomas Hanley, in response to the rapidly growing railway worker's camp situated adjacent to where they were planning to extend the Illawarra railway line across a bridge being constructed over the Georges River. The Woronora Post Office opened on 16 May 1883, adjacent to the Woronora Hotel; this facility also being operated by Mr Hanley. In 1922, the postal locality of Woronora was changed to Como upon a suggestion offered by Mr James Frederick Murphy, manager of the Holt- Sutherland Co. and the affairs of Thomas Holt (1811‚Äì1888),http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/como who at the time owned much of the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla. Mr Murphy likened the area to its namesake in Italyhttps://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/como on account of its similarity to Lake Comohttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news- page1404514?zoomLevel=3 at the foot of the Lepontine Alps and Lugano Prealps. The Italian influence on the suburb is also reflected in many of the existing street names, which were named after various cities located throughout Italy including Genoa Street, Verona Range, Tivoli Esplanade, Ortona Parade, Novara Crescent, Pavia Road, Cremona Road and Loretta Avenue (originally named Loretto,http://parishmaps.lands.nsw.gov.au/mrsid/show_java.pl?width=800&height;=600‚Ñë=PMapMN05/14047201.sid&client;=pmap http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-lfsp2714-sd&width;=1200 a misspelling of the Italian city of Loreto). On 5 May 1883, a Government notice in the Evening News (Sydney)Evening News (Sydney), 5 May 1883, page 5 announced a proposal for a \\"new Public School at Worinora, George's River\\". Shortly after, on 10 Jul 1883 first mention of the Como Post Office appears in an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald,Sydney Morning Herald, 10 Jul 1883, page 7 thus confirming the locality had already officially been renamed to Como. On 25 Sep 1883, the NSW Government awarded the tender for timber construction of the new Worinora Public School to R.G. Troughton, for the sum of ¬£199 4s.Evening News (Sydney), 25 Sep 1883, page 2 The Worinora School, built just to the south of Scylla Bay, opened on 16 April 1884. Some newspapers and periodicals in the period 1884-1885 went so far as to wax lyrical over the broader section of Georges River water east of Murphy's Pleasure Grounds and bounded by the rising headlands and hillsides, frequently referring to it in their articles as \\"Lake Como\\".Australian Town & Country Journal, Sydney, Saturday 17 May 1884, page 42Evening News, Sydney, Friday 5 June 1885, page 3 On 14 Jun 1884, an article in the Australian Town & Country Journal notes that Mr Hanley had enlarged a room at the Woronora Hotel to cater as an assembly hall and theatre for the now hundreds of women and children encamped nearby. The article also mentions that the Como Public School grounds were soon to be improved, thus confirming the school name had also been officially changed to Como.Australian Town & Country Journal, 14 Jun 1884, page 41 Around this time, James Murphy and his brothers, John Francis and Michael Vincent, were also partners in managing Murphy's Pleasure GroundsThe Sydney Morning Herald, Tuesday 4 Mar 1919, page 5 where to the annoyance of many locals, they had fenced off the small promontory east of their boat house and constructed a rotunda lookout and adjacent flag mast upon the highest viewing point (known by locals today as Como Mountain) and began charging day-trippers and tourists a small fee for access.Evening News, Sydney, Tuesday 25 October 1887, page 3 Murphy's Pleasure Grounds would later be reclaimed for public use and is generally known as the Como Pleasure Grounds to this day. James Murphy also constructed Como House which burnt down in 1969. After James F. Murphy died, his estate provided scholarships for young men studying agricultural science at St John's College Sydney and the Hawkesbury Agricultural College. In January 1887, the first (presumed small) version of George Agnew's Como Hotel had been constructed ‚Äî however only in a non-liquor capacity. It was most likely built upon the same site as the later larger versions would stand on. This small first establishment would last around two years, until the much larger second version build began in March 1888 (see the version one timeline below for full details). In March 1888, tenders were called for the construction of a major 20-room hotel at Como, by master building contractor Robert Fielding (on behalf of George Agnew). However, this decision had been made at the same time when the majority of the temporary railway workers with their families had already begun moving out of Como and heading further south with the ongoing extension of the Illawarra railway line. In effect, George was building a bigger, grander hotel that would be reliant on a rapidly dwindling population to survive ‚Äî in hindsight, a very poor business decision. By 9 July 1890, leasing agent W.H. Tulloh was advertising the new, grand \\"Como Hotel\\" to be for purchase or lease. It seems George Agnew may have over-extended spending to get the grand second version of the hotel completed. Unsurprisingly, with the 1890 Depression in full swing there were no takers for an expensive-to-run hotel, especially in a tiny town with a declining populace and no public school. With no further takers after more advertisement in October 1890, George Agnew was forced to apply himself for a Publicans' License. He struggled on, operating the \\"Como Hotel\\" until he could sell it to Daniel Sullivan in September 1891. By 1894, George Agnew was still in financial difficulty, being forced to sell all his household furniture and effects from his Como residence. The second establishment of the Como Hotel was frequented by the Australian poet Henry Lawson, who lived at Como in the early 1900s. Local legend has it that Lawson \\"used to row a boat from his house to the hotel and sell or recite his poems for beer.\\" Unfortunately, the tale of poor business woes for successive owners of the \\"Como Hotel\\" was to continue for many more years, as the tiny, slowly re- growing population, the terrible economic effect of WW1, the 1930s Depression & WW2, all took their toll on the business (see Timeline from 1890-1925 below for full details). In 1939, the Como West Post Office was opened, along with the first classroom(s) at the new Como West Public School. Como West was severely affected by bushfires in 1994, with upwards of 70 houses burnt down. Como West Public School was also destroyed by the fires and a new school was built on the original land.1994 Eastern seaboard fires The iconic, second version of the Como Hotel was destroyed on 3 November 1996, after an electrical fault in the restaurant kitchen started a massive blaze. A sympathetically styled third version reconstruction was completed five years later on the same site in 2001. Boat building/hire By early 1884, the Murphy brothers partnership had built and were managing the first commercial boat house and boat hire facilities at Como being located just east of where the rail bridge over the Georges River was later to be constructed. Como had also been developing a reputation (reported in the newspapers of the time) for skilled boat building, with suitable facilities located on the south bank of the Georges River, also near where the future rail bridge was to be built. On Saturday 17 January 1885, it was reported that the \\"Active\\" - a large steamer constructed of kauri, spotted gum and ironbark, being 115 ft in length, weighing 150tons, with 40 hp paddle steam engines, was successfully launched at Como.Evening News, Sydney, Friday 5 June 1885 She was built by Mr Harry Stephens for Messrs C. & E. Miller (one of the Illawarra Railway Line contractors) and was intended to carry railway materials from South Australian ports. In June 1885, it was noted in the Evening News that \\"Near the bridge the Holt-Sutherland Company are erecting a fine jetty where the largest vessels can anchor at high tide\\" (it would be safe to presume this refers to the same one depicted in numerous old photos of the time which show a large new jetty east of James Murphy's boat house). On 25 January 1886, a Tender was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald by James Murphy (manager) for \\"Leasing Boathouse, Residence, and slip near the railway platform, Como\\"The Sydney Morning Herald, Monday 25 Jan 1886, page 11 On 16 Feb 1894, it was reported in the Evening News (Sydney)Evening News, Sydney, Friday 16 February 1894, page 1 that the boat hire business of H.C. Press & Sons was forced to close down their operations, following a successful Court appeal against their application for Lease by their main competition - James F. Murphy & F.S.E. Holt. On 17 May 1894,Sydney Morning Herald, 17 May 1894, page 6 it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald that another boat hire operator, Mr John H. Wills, had been successful in obtaining a lease on the western side of the Como Station for a boat shed and wharf. Unfortunately for Mr Wills, not long after he opened his boat hire business, on 7 December 1895 the Evening News reported that \\"Wills's boatshed, at Como, had been destroyed to-day by fire\\".The Evening News (Sydney), 7 Dec 1895, page 5 On 18 November 1898 an advertisement appears in the Evening News \\"FIRST-CLASS BOATS FOR HIRE AT COMO, by H.C. Press. Trial solicited\\", indicating he had been successful in Appealing the previous decision, which now allowed them to re-open their floating multi-story Palace Hall and boat hire sheds for business once more.Evening News, Sydney, Friday 18 November 1898, page 1 Press's boat sheds held 64 wooden craft (mostly rowing skiffs). Their facilities were located immediately adjacent to the eastern side of the southern bridge abutment (just west of Murphy's Boat House facilities) and can be seen in numerous historical images of the time. By 1899, with the population of Sydney expanding rapidly southwards (thanks to the extension of the Illawarra railway line through opening of the railway bridge across the Georges River at Como) the demand for river boat tours along the Georges River upstream from Como had grown to the point where a large 200 passenger paddle steamer called the S.S. \\"Telephone\\" began making return tours to the Parkesvale Pleasure Grounds (now Picnic Point) from J.H. Wills Boat House & jetty located on the western side of Como Station.http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/87763 Circa 1905/1906, advertisements for H.C. Press & Sons Ball Room & Boat Hire facilities at Como cease, instead advertising their other Woolloomooloo Bay boating facilities. On 22 May 1920, an advertisement is placed in the Sydney Morning Herald by receivers J. Sydney Smith (Como), M. Maloney & J. Roberts, for the Estate of the late John F. Murphy (one of James Murphy's brothers and business partner) for the sale of the \\"FEDERAL BOAT LETTING COMPANY, COMO...The assets consist of about sixty (60) light cedar varnished skiffs, which are stored in two boatsheds, one of which is a floating pontoon, above which is erected a large hall. There is also a four-roomed dwelling above a large workshop, also two wharves at side of sheds.\\"The Sydney Morning Herald, 22 May 1920, page 7 Illawarra Railway Line GEORGES RIVER RAILWAY BRIDGE AND COMO STATION On 12 September 1882, Tenders were called for constructing the first section. C. and M. Millar won the contract to build the section from Redfern to Waterfall, crossing the Georges River and into the Holt-Sutherland Estate via the Double Bay paddock.http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/como It was reported on 27 Sep 1884 in the Australian Town & Country Journal that the station for Como would be located \\"at the rear of the Worinora Hotel\\".Australian Town & Country Journal, 27 Sep 1884, page 41 On 26 December 1885 the original single-track Como railway bridge spanning the Georges River began first services, with the opening of the bridge and single platform railway station at Como.The Railway Bridge at Como Eardley, Gifford Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin February 1967 pp 42‚Äì47 Rather alarmingly, it was not until 19 Jan 1886 (a month after opening) that the New South Wales Government Railway testing engineer carried out an initial load strength safety test on the bridge.Sydney Morning Herald, 20 Jan 1886, page 8 Also of interest is the media report on 2 Mar 1886 (3 months after the official opening) that construction of the initial station building was still underway.Sydney Morning Herald, 2 Mar 1886, page 5 The original layout of this single track and platform with a small station building on the east side of the track can be seen in a very rare early image circa mid-1886, held by the State Library of Victoriahttp://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/305574 Although \\"Woronora\\" had already proven popular with Sydney fishermen, small-boat sailors and picnickers from the early 1880s, upon the eagerly anticipated opening of the new railway bridge at Como in January 1886, the locality immediately became far more popular as a weekend retreat for city folk venturing southwards on the Illawarra Line. The natural environment at Como made it popular for river cruises, and holiday makers and trains were reported as being overcrowded on their first day of service along the newly extended section reaching to Sutherland. The rapid increase in passenger demand was such that by Feb 1891, the small single platform and station building located on the eastern side of the original single track were being replaced with dual extended station platforms, one on the east and one on the west side flanking a short section of dual railway tracks. In addition, a larger station building on the western station platform replaced the much smaller one that had originally stood on the single eastern platform.The Daily Telegraph, 3 Feb 1891, page 5 Old (closer) and new Como bridges Since 1942, the original Georges River rail bridge has carried Sydney Water's pipeline, which runs from Woronora Dam to the Penshurst Reservoirs.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4580022 In 1972, a new concrete dual-track railway bridge was constructed to the west of the original Como Railway Bridge. It eliminated the bottleneck imposed by the original Gauntlet track design which had limited service numbers on the increasingly busy Sutherland line. A new Como railway station was built 800m further to the south, and the old station demolished. The original iconic Como Railway Bridge has been converted for use by pedestrians and cyclists. Hotels/Accommodation The first hotel to open in the area (circa 1883) was reported somewhat confusingly in newspapers of the day as either the \\"Woronora\\", \\"Woniora\\", \\"Wiganora\\" or \\"Worinora\\" Hotel (see Timeline below for details). Newspaper references to a second, larger establishment that was constructed circa January 1887 and known generally as the \\"Como Hotel\\" do not appear until June 1887 (also see Timeline further down page for extensive detail) THE WORONORA HOTEL Definitive Timeline: Circa 1882/83 - First established by proprietor Mr Thomas Hanley (aka Handley), the \\"Woronora Hotel\\" was a \\"humble hostelry\\" - a modest size weatherboard & iron roofed building, located near the southern shore of the Georges River & close by the first railway workers' tent camp, that also contained worker's wives & children, for a total population of around 120.https://dictionaryofsydney.org/building/woronora_hotel 12 May 1883 - A notice in the Sydney Morning Herald states - \\"POST OFFICES. - Post offices will be established on the 16th instant, at Como (Railway Crossing, George's River), near Woniora;\\"The Sydney Morning Herald, 12 May 1883, page 9 This is the first public reference to the fact that the old locality of \\"Woronora\\" had officially been changed to \\"Como\\" (on the suggestion of James Murphy, manager of the Holt-Sutherland Co.) The \\"Como Post Office\\" was built adjacent to Hanley's \\"Woronora Hotel\\" & Thomas managed both businesses. 10 Jul 1883 - A report in the Sydney Morning Herald on the progress of the Illawarra Railway Line extension at Georges River states - \\"The other side of the river near to the mouth of the Woronora presents a busy scene. Here the line begins to pass over the Holt-Sutherland Estate. There is a little town of canvas, with an hotel of weatherboards and a post-office of currugated iron. This post-office is called \\"Como\\", on account of the beauty of its natural surroundings and the lovely lake-like character of George's River from this point to the eastward, second only to the celebrated \\"Lago di Como\\", so well known to travellers on the continent of Europe\\".The Sydney Morning Herald, 10 Jul 1883, page 7 However, Thomas Hanley retained the name \\"Woronora Hotel\\" for his small enterprise located adjacent to the \\"Como Post Office\\". 17 May 1884 - The Australian Town & Country (Sydney) reports that at Como, Georges River, \\"There is a capital hotel called the Worinora, kept by Mr Hanley.\\"Australian Town & Country (Sydney), 17 May 1884 15 Sep 1884 - The Evening News (Sydney) reported a destructive fire had destroyed Mr Hanley's Post Office & store next to his \\"Worinora Hotel\\" with the loss of all postal records.Evening News (Sydney), 15 Sep 1884 An enquiry was held in October with an open finding.Sydney Morning Herald, 6 Oct 1884, page 5 27 Sep 1884 - The Australian Town & Country Journal reports that at Como, Georges River, \\"The petition of the inhabitants, relative to a railway station, has at length been acceded to, the site chosen being at the rear of the Worinora Hotel.\\" 8 Nov 1884 - By this time, the population of Como had more than quadrupled. The Illawarra Mercury reports that Como \\"boasts 500 or 600 souls. Most of the residences are of canvas, but there are a few of weatherboard and corrugated iron. Amongst the most substantial looking of these is the Public School and the Woronora Hotel\\".Illawarra Mercury (Wollongong), 8 Nov 1884 29 Dec 1885 - A report in the Daily Telegraph titled \\"A Trip To Como And Sutherland\\" notes - \\"At present there is only a platform at Como, but an embryo hotel is visible as the sign of a coming civilisation\\".Daily Telegraph (Sydney), 29 Dec 1885, page 6 The \\"emryo hotel\\" referred to being the otherwise titled \\"Woronora Hotel\\". Mid 1886 - A rare, historic photo taken shortly after the first single track Como Station had been constructed in early 1886 shows a small iron roof building located directly below & to the left of the station building, most likely being the \\"Woronora Hotel\\". There can be seen some railway workers' tent lines nearby (the majority of workers had by then moved 3 miles or further southwards with the completion of the bridge crossing & first cuttings). There are no signs whatsoever of any building activity further along the line, at the exact site where construction of the first version of George Agnew's \\"German Club\\" aka the \\"Como Hotel\\" would later be completed circa January 1887. 6 Nov 1886 - The Evening News (Sydney) reported that due to a lack of space at the school to accommodate 200 visiting members of the Fruit Growers Union who had travelled to Como for a picnic (which was washed out from rain) \\"Mrs Stephenson of the Woronora Hotel, very kindly threw open her private rooms for the use of those (ladies) who were crowded out of the schoolroom\\".Evening News (Sydney), 6 Nov 1886, page 4 28 Dec 1886 - A critique in the Sydney Morning Herald laments the lack at Como of \\"...a suitable place for the refreshment of the inner man. The Wiganora (sic) Hotel, respectably as it is conducted by Mr William Stevenson, is altogether inadequate for the demands made upon it at holiday time\\" and continues \\"...the owners of the Holt-Sutherland Estate might well consider whether it would not be to their interest to grant some enterprising capitalist a lease upon such liberal terms as would induce public to the district\\".The Sydney Morning Herald, 28 Dec 1886, page 3 This may have led the Holt-Sutherland Estate partners to invest in starting to build what would become the 1st version of the Como Hotel, with its first Licensee to be George Agnew. 24 May 1887 - In the meantime, following the public criticism (above), some renovations & extensions must have been made to the Woronora Hotel, as what would be the last advertisement for the fully licensed \\"Woronora Hotel\\" was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald, proclaiming - \\"COMO. COMO. COMO. - WORONORA HOTEL, Como, George's River. This hotel is now open. If you wish to spend an enjoyable day visit Como on Queen's Birthday, where you can get wines, spirits, and beers, of best brands. Also Pleasure and Fishing Boats for Hire.\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 24 May 1887, page 2 Also note that the newly constructed competitor for the tourist trade becoming known in the media as \\"Agnew's Hotel\\" or simply the \\"Como Hotel\\" was NOT licensed at that time to serve liquor. 25 May 1887 - A reporter in an article about the recently opened Illawarra Line at Como, makes mention of \\"An hotel known as the Woronora Hotel, which marks another stage in the progress of the place, has just been opened at Como, and will, no doubt, prove a great convenience to visitors on holidays and other occasions\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 25 May 1887, page 8 Within a month, the newly constructed 1st version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" (though only a Provisional License, not yet legally able to sell alcohol) had advertised \\"Open for business\\", with meals and accommodation for pick-nickers, day-trippers and tourists. It appears this increased competition for income from wealthier tourists visiting Como from this new, larger hotel would cause the lesser \\"Woronora Hotel\\" to be closed down (presumably within the same year) since no more articles or advertisements referring to the \\"Woronora Hotel\\" are to be found in the various newspapers of the time following the last advertisement listed here. THE COMO HOTEL There appears to have been three (3) distinct versions of this establishment over time. The First Version The first version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" was rather small, made of weatherboard anand iron roofed. Its construction was most likely funded by the Holt- Sutherland Estate partners (who owned all the commercial land leases at Como) and was completed circa Jan 1887 by the remaining immigrant railway workers (and was known colloquially as the \\"German Club\\"). However it appears from subsequent newspaper advertisements of the time to have been licensed for accommodation only (those \\"refreshment needs\\" being served by Mr William Stevenson, a new Licensee of the so-called \\"Woronora Hotel\\" nearby). Unlike the advertisements for the \\"Woronora Hotel\\" espousing the availability of all forms of liquor, the first advertisements being placed by George Agnew for the early version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" NEVER mention availability of spirits or alcoholic drinks - only meals, tea, coffee, accommodation, fishing, shooting, boat hire etc. Definitive Timeline: 28 Dec 1886 - A critique in the Sydney Morning Herald laments the lack at Como of \\"...a suitable place for the refreshment of the inner man. The Wiganora (sic) Hotel, respectably as it is conducted by Mr William Stevenson, is altogether inadequate for the demands made upon it at holiday time\\" and continues \\"...the owners of the Holt- Sutherland Estate might well consider whether it would not be to their interest to grant some enterprising capitalist a lease upon such liberal terms as would induce public to the district\\".[43] This may have led the Holt- Sutherland Estate partners to invest in starting to build what would become the 1st version of the Como Hotel, with its first Licensee to be George Agnew. Circa Jan 1887 - Work on constructing the 1st (much smaller) build of the \\"Como Hotel\\" was completed mostly by the available remaining German & Italian railway workers, apparently followed by a few months of equipping & fitting out. 2 May 1887 - James Murphy, manager of the Holt-Sutherland Estate Land Co., Limited, places an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald for the \\"LEASE OF HOTEL AT COMO\\" adding \\"The Buildings have just had extensive alterations and additions made, and a NEW LICENSE HAS BEEN GRANTED\\".The Sydney Morning Herald, 2 May 1887, page 9 20 Jun 1887 - The first advertisement appears in the Sydney Morning Herald for \\"AGNEW'S COMO HOTEL. If you wish to spend an enjoyable day, don't forget to visit COMO. The scenery cannot be surpassed in the colony. First class accommodation for visitors. Luncheon provided. Also splendid fishing grounds. Boats for Hire. GEORGE AGNEW, PROPRIETOR\\"The Sydney Morning Herald, Saturday 20 June 1887, page 2 Note that this advertisement mentions accommodation & meals only, since a Publican's License to legally sell liquor had not been granted. 1 Jan 1888 - In what should have been a boon for both Hotels, the first major sale of residential land blocks at Como (comprising 119 Lots) was undertaken on behalf of the Holt-Sutherland Estate by agents Richardson & Wrench.The Daily Telegraph, Sydney, Tuesday 27 December 1887, page 2 17 Mar 1888 - An advertisement is placed in the Sydney Morning Herald by George Agnew for the \\"COMO HOTEL, Como, George's River, Illawarra Line. Parties staying at Hotel can have use of private Boats for fishing &c.; Tea and coffee at all hours. Terms moderate\\".The Sydney Morning Herald, 17 Mar 1888, page 22 Note that again, there is NO mention of any availability of liquor or alcoholic beverages. The tone is of a friendly, family oriented theme being promoted. The definitive history and fate of the 1st version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" - apart from the scant few newspaper articles referred to here - is unclear. There appear to be no newspaper records relating to its initial construction, and no references that could help determine whether it was demolished outright and totally replaced by the second, much larger Edwardian styled version, or was simply incorporated into the second build (though that seems unlikely, given that the second version built circa 1888-1889 used 160,000 bricks in its ground floor). The Second Version The first version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" (also known colloquially as the \\"German Club\\") must have been considered inadequate for the ongoing plans of the Holt- Sutherland Estate partners, who wished to develop a large number of residential blocks at Como & thus needed to entice buyers to the area. Barely a year later on 30 March 1888 it was reported that George Agnew (first proprietor of \\"Agnew's Como Hotel\\") had submitted plans & applied for a Conditional License to construct a much bigger, brand new 16 room hotel (on a new Lease within the Holt-Sutherland Estate at Como). The License for this new build was granted one month later in April 1888. Tenders sought by building contractor Robert Fielding were called during Dec 1889-Feb 1890 for sub- contractors to supply large quantities of building materials & carry out associated works, including delivery of 160,000 bricks, quarrying local stone, providing and erecting large quantities of iron posts, railings & ornamental castings, providing plumbing & plastering work etc. Construction of this much grander, Edwardian styled, multi-storey Hotel establishment was completed by the end of June 1890. Early photos taken circa 1894 clearly show the facade(s) bore an Establishment Year of \\"1890\\" in an artistic \\"cartouche\\" style, being a large \\"1\\" overlaid with a smaller \\"8\\", with \\"9\\" to the left and \\"0\\" to the right of the centrally aligned \\"1\\" & \\"8\\" combination. Unfortunately, during 1890 Australian economic conditions worsened rapidly, with many large strikes crippling large industries (maritime, wool, coal etc). The following 3 years saw a terrible economic Depression set in across the country. Unsurprisingly, due either to these prevailing poor business conditions (or just poor management) the first ten years of operation of the iconic & grand Edwardian styled version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" got off to a very rocky start. First proprietor George Agnew must have spent so much in building the establishment that he was forced to advertise for a buyer/lessee soon after he had opened it. However, having failed to get a suitable buyer/lessee for his hotel after four months (Jul 1890 to Oct 1890), he himself was forced to apply for a Conditional Publican's License, while continuing to search for a buyer/lessee. His Publican's License was granted on 17 Oct 1890. With the general economy in ruins, George's Buy/Lease advertisements were getting no takers, & almost a year later in Sep 1891, \\"Como Hotel\\" owner/publican George & his wife were successfully sued by Tooth & Co. for a bounced cheque, being fined \\"¬£5 and costs, in default one month's imprisonment\\". Finally, on 25 Sep 1891 (almost 14 months after George's first Buy/Lease advertisement) a notice in the Australian Star newspaper listed George Agnew had transferred his Publican's License to a new Lessee & publican, Mr Daniel Sullivan, thus signalling a tumultuous period for the \\"Como Hotel\\" involving rapid turnover of owners/Licensees (see the partial Timeline below for more detail). By the time Paul Buchholz had bought out the License on 16 Feb 1905, he had become the 12th Licensee in only 13¬Ω years (exclusive of the 1st owner/Licensee, George Agnew). In 1983, the \\"Como Hotel\\" was purchased by a unit trust company headed by Mr Russell Coshott, who planned to \\"restore & upgrade the Hotel\\" by subdividing & selling as residential lots, the adjoining two acres of freehold land. However, the plan was blocked by vehement local opposition.Sydney Morning Herald, 1 Nov 1988, page 34 On 16 July 1984, it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald that \\"The elegant old Como Hotel, described as an Australian version of a Victorian period seaside pleasure palace, has been protected by a Heritage Council anti-demolition order. The four-storey white stucco, brick and timber hotel in Cremona Road at the southern end of the Como railway bridge, has been a landmark of the Georges River foreshores since the 1880s. In recent weeks controversy has raged in the Como community about plans by the owners to erect a four-storey building of 42 flats and a carpark behind the hotel. The plans have been opposed by local resident and environmental groups. Sutherland Shire Council recently rejected the development application on several grounds. These included that the flats would have a detrimental impact on the scenic quality of the locality\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 16 Jul 1984, page 3 (footnote - the article is mistaken in stating this version of the Como Hotel was Established in the 1880s - it should read from 1890). Unfortunately, on 3 Nov 1996 the \\"Como Hotel\\" was ravaged by fire as a result of an unattended gas cooker in the restaurant kitchen. Definitive Timeline 1888-1923: 30 Mar 1888 - Notice of Application was made in the Daily Telegraph (Sydney) by George Agnew for a Conditional Publican's License \\"for a house to be erected at Como, Georges River, containing 16 rooms exclusive of those required for the use of the family, and in accordance with the plans lodged with the Licensing Clerk, Sydney\\".The Daily Telegraph (Sydney), 30 Mar 1888, page 1 This was for plans to either completely re-build his existing more modestly-sized \\"Como Hotel\\" or for approval to build a completely new larger structure, where the current version now stands. 18 Apr 1888 - George Agnew was granted a Conditional License \\"for an hotel at Como\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 18 April 1888 Following the re-build/new construction, this new \\"Como Hotel\\" would go on to serve as the German workers' club throughout the duplication of railway lines and construction of the dual rail bridge. However, it still had to survive a rocky first few years of business, with the Lease passing through the hands of numerous Licensees. 15 Jan 1889 - George Agnew, licensee, \\"was fined ¬£5 and costs, in default one month's imprisonment, for having committed a breach of the Licensing Act in selling liquor on a Sunday\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 15 Jan 1889, page 5 17 Dec 1889 - Multiple Tenders are invited by building contractor R.

The Third Version The existing \\"third\\" version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" was constructed five years after the iconic second version had been destroyed by fire in 1996, with the rebuild (on the same site) completed in 2001. It featured a modern but sympathetic interpretation of the 2nd version's Edwardian design - the new restaurant was aptly named \\"The Burnt Door\\" & it displays at its center the charred remains of one of the hotel's doors which had been salvaged from the ashes of the inferno. In early 2013, the current 3rd version of the \\"Como Hotel\\", located at 35 Cremona Road, sold for $4.6 million on a yield of 14.4% to the Riversdale Group (whose backers included John Singleton, retired head of Qantas Geoff Dixon, and private equity investor Mark Carnegie). Towards the end of 2016, the Riversdale Group sold the \\"Como Hotel\\" for $5.6 million to the Oscars Hotel Group. Establishment Date Clarification The current (3rd) version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" bears an Establishment date (applied during 2001 construction) on the upper facades of \\"1878\\". However, all the publicly available research shows this is clearly incorrect. With the locality of \\"Como\\" not even coming into existence until early mid-1883 & the fact(s) that the original 1st version of the \\"Como Hotel\\" was not even completed construction until January 1887, nor was the second iconic version construction completed until early 1890, the currently displayed date of \\"1878\\" is clearly wrong. This has led to many other less comprehensively researched articles regarding the \\"Como Hotel\\" quoting the historically incorrect Establishment date of \\"1878\\", rather than what should be the factual Establishment date of \\"1890\\" (also confirmed by a vintage photo circa 1894 of the second version's facadehttp://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-148979938). Transport Como railway station is on the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line of the Sydney Trains network. Como is the first station after crossing the Georges River from Oatley in the St George area. Como is approximately 35 minutes from Sydney Central. Although the idea had been proposed in the early years, no road bridge was ever constructed across the George's River at Como. Landmarks The Como Hotel is an Edwardian styled hotel which was extensively rebuilt in 2001 after a large fire had destroyed the original 2nd version back in November 1996. It is easy to watch the local rugby league football from the balconies of this hotel. Dining can be had at the aptly named \\"Burnt Door\\" restaurant within. Other landmark buildings in the suburb include the Como School of Arts, Cafe de Como and the Como Marina on the Georges River. Picnickers & families with children are well catered for with the expanded play area facilities, lawns & seating in and around the Como Pleasure Grounds. The famous Sydney rock oyster can still be scrounged around the muddy Como foreshore by the adventurous at low tide. Schools Como features two well-regarded public schools: Como Public School and Como West Public School Como Public School The original name for the first school to be built in the locality was actually called the \\"Worinora School\\". This name was changed shortly after it was completed construction in late 1883 to \\"Como Public School\\". The school was located about 100 metres south of the southernmost extent of what would later become known as Scylla Bay. The site of the first school (with adjacent flagpole and school masters house) can clearly be seen in a photo of the area, taken circa 1894 AFTER the school had been closed down for good).http://digital.sl.nsw.gov.au/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=FL1705419&embedded;=true&toolbar;=false Como Public School Definitive Timeline 1883-1923: OLD SCHOOL 5 May 1883 - The Evening News (Sydney) reports \\"NEW SCHOOL. - It is proposed to establish a public school at Worinora, George's River.\\"The Evening News (Sydney), 5 May 1883, page 5 25 Sep 1883 - The Evening News (Sydney) reports \\"...tenders, in connection with public schools, have been accepted by the Government:- ...

Oct 1885 - The first version of the \\"Como Public School\\" is closed for good, owing to a significant decline in the local population as the temporary railway worker camps moved further south along the Illawarra line extensions. It appears the buildings were retained for some years later, with the old school building, flagpole & headmaster's house seen in the background of the 1894 photo of the Como Hotel.

Sport and Recreation Como is home to the St George Rowing Club. Many renowned rowers begin their sculling career here. Como also features a number of parks, including Scylla Bay Oval (home to the successful Como-Jannali Crocodiles) and the historic Como Pleasure Grounds, home to the Como Swimming Club, with swimming baths and a freshwater pool. There is a pleasant public park originally called the \\"Henry Lawson Memorial Reserve\\" (so-named at a large public ceremony held before 600 attendees on 19 September 1954The Propeller (Hurstville), 30 Sep 1954, page 1) which is accessed via both Wolger and Bulumin Streets in Como West which was, and still is, very popular with local inhabitants and their children with a modern playground to entertain. The original big swings and chrome steel \\"slippery dip\\" were installed circa 1954 on the account of the West Como Progress Association.The Propeller, 1 Jul 1954, page 1 Como Population Population Timeline: 1883 - May 1883 - Approx. 120 inhabitants total, comprising mainly temporary railway workers, some with families. 10 Jul 1883 - A report in the Sydney Morning Herald states \\"There is a little town of canvas, with an hotel of weatherboards and a post-office of corrugated iron. This post-office is called \\"Como\\"\\" and \\"There are hundreds of men, women, and children living in the vicinity of this point...\\"Como, New South Wales#cite note-34 8 Nov 1884 - Report in the Illawarra Mercury states \\"The second section of the railway commences at a place called Como, which owes its present activity and local habitation solely to the railway works. Just now it boasts of something like a population of 500 or 600 souls\\".The Illawarra Mercury, 8 Nov 1884 This number would have dropped significantly by mid 1885, since most of the railway workers with their families kept moving southwards out of Como with the rapid extension of the Illawarra line though Sutherland, Heathcote & beyond. 18 Apr 1885 - It was reported in the Australian Town and Country Journal that \\"Business is slack just now, owing to the exodus of population up the line; but good judges state that in a brief period Como will become a thriving settlement. Already land is being rapidly cleared for sale, with fine water frontages, and there should be good hotel prospects by-and- bye\\".The Australian Town & Country Journal, 18 Apr 1885, page 15 The \\"good judges\\" referred to here were most likely representatives of the Holt- Sutherland Estate Land Co., keen to further their prospects. 9 May 1885 - A report on Como in The Australian Town & Country magazine noted \\"The population is steadily moving up the line, and a continued increase from the 24-mile to the 30-mile takes place daily. Consequently last pay night was dull at Como, and business residents are also thinking of moving.\\"The Evening News (Sydney), 9 May 1885 6 Oct 1885 - It is reported in the Sydney Evening News that \\"...the Government intends to erect a platform at Como, where there is a gradient of 1 in 44, and where there are no settlers at all;\\"The Evening News (Sydney), 6 Oct 1885, page 7 1886-1890 - Como's total population (both permanent & temporary) would have remained very low. Even the first Como land sales conducted by the Holt-Sutherland Estate during the period 1887-1890 went mainly to a handful of wealthier developers, who then had trouble in on- selling these residential lots in any significant numbers once the economic conditions deteriorated even further towards the beginning of the 1890s. 1890-1894 - One of the worst financial & economic Depressions in Australia's history swept across the country during this period. It is unlikely the permanent population of Como grew at all during this period of significant financial hardship for many businesses - but especially so for many of the low to middle income class workers who lost their jobs. Ironically, it was at this exact moment the new, grander Edwardian styled \\"Como Hotel\\", ostensibly designed by the Holt-Sutherland Estate investors to attract permanent residents to Como in conjunction with their proposed Land sales, began trading. The subsequent lack of sufficient population growth or spending in Como ensured these early years for the (numerous) Licensees who \\"tried their luck\\" investing in the \\"Como Hotel\\" were fraught with financial difficulties. 6 Aug 1931 - The first Catholic Mass was held in the School of Arts building in Como (70 residents attended), with a report in The Catholic Press stating \\"Settlement at Como dates back more than 50 years, but the town has for various reasons made little progress, and its population is still very small\\".The Catholic Press, 6 Aug 1931, page 16 8 Oct 1952 - An article in the Weekly Times (Melbourne) mentions that \\"Mrs. Larkin senior is postmistress at Como (population 680)\\".Weekly Times (Melbourne), 8 Oct 1952, page 40 This further supports the ample evidence that Como's permanent population had virtually stagnated for 68 years, following the temporary railway worker population boom of 1884. 2001 Australian Census - 3,673 people in 1,322 private dwellings. 2006 Australian Census - 3,736 people in 1,290 private dwellings. 2011 Australian Census - 3,789 people in 1,319 private dwellings. 2016 Australian Census - 3,977 people in 1,352 private dwellings. =Demographics= According to the 2011 census of Population, there were 3,789 residents in Como. The most common ancestries in Como were English 30.8%, Australian 30.7% and Irish 10.3%. In Como, 93.9% of occupied dwellings were separate houses, compared to the national average of 75.6%. There was also a high rate of home ownership in Como, with only 9.8% of occupied private dwellings being rented.

Early life and career A native of Florence, Pavolini was the son of Paolo Emilio Pavolini, a major scholar of Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages. A brilliant student, he earned a law degree at the University of Florence and a political science degree at La Sapienza in Rome, travelling to and from between the two cities. His brother was the writer Corrado Pavolini. After joining Benito Mussolini's movement in Florence, he took part in several actions of the Blackshirts, and led a squad during the 1922 March on Rome ‚Äì the moment when Fascism took over in Italy. Pavolini was assigned tasks in the cultural field (including youth programs launched by the fascists), while contributing to fascist publications such as Battaglie fasciste, Rivoluzione fascista, and Critica fascista. Thanks to his acquaintance with Florentine fascist leader Luigi Ridolfi, he broke into active politics, becoming Ridolfi's deputy in 1927. From 1929 to 1934, he was local leader of the National Fascist Party (PNF) in Florence, as well as editor of the fascist publication Il Bargello (named after a military rank of the Middle Ages), which urged all intellectuals to contribute; Pavolini aimed for an image of Fascism as cultural and aristocratic ‚Äì he initiated a series of cultural events that survived both Fascism and his death, including the yearly costumed re-enactment of the Italian Renaissance-era sport Calcio Fiorentino, the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino music festival and the Ponte Vecchio Artisans' Exhibit. Between 1934 and 1942, he was a regular contributor to Corriere della Sera as a \\"special guest\\". Prominence Bombacci, Mussolini, Petacci, Pavolini and Starace in Piazzale Loreto, 1945. After becoming a member of the national PNF leadership in 1932, he moved on from local politics to become the president of the Fascist Confederation of Professionals and Artists, which propelled him to a leadership position in the Council of Corporations. He took part in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War as a lieutenant inspecting the squadron led by Galeazzo Ciano (a group nicknamed La Disperata), and as a correspondent for Corriere della Sera. Throughout his political career, Pavolini published cultural and literary essays, such as Disperata (\\"The Desperate\\"; 1937) and Scomparsa d'Angela (\\"Angela's Disappearance\\"; 1940). In 1939, he was appointed by Mussolini Minister of Popular Culture, and served until January 1943. Minister of Popular Culture (Minculpop in short) meant in fact Ministry of Propaganda and Pavolini had an iron grip on what the press could or could not publish. The written instructions to the press (including radio broadcasts and \\"Luce\\" cinema newsreels) were dubbed veline (tissue paper) by the newsmen and covered an amazing variety of domains (from forbidding to publish photos of boxer Primo Carnera knocked out and lying unconscious to the obligation of publishing flattering propaganda photos of Mussolini on a brand new Fiat tractor or forbidding to publish photos of Naples under the snow, fearing it would damage the tourism industry). Minculpop also tackled the cinema industry (the famous and very creative Cinecitta studios in Rome were created by Mussolini's will to act as a counter against Hollywood productions; the Venice film festival is also a creation of the fascist period). Pavolini was deeply involved in the cinema industry (either on the propaganda or on the entertainment sides of it) and famously had a much publicized affair with Doris Duranti, a film actress of the period who starred in the Telefoni Bianchi subgenre of light comedy films and prominently featured in the very first bare-bosomed scene in Italian cinema. The Allied invasion of Sicily and the ousting of Mussolini in Rome brought Nazi intervention and the proclamation of a new fascist puppet state, the northern Italian Social Republic. Pavolini was integrated into the Republic's administration under Mussolini, and was immediately promoted head of the successor of the PNF, the Republican Fascist Party (PFR) (the only person to occupy that post); he took part in the drafting of major documents, including the Verona manifesto that called for the execution of former Grand Council of Fascism members who had voted against Mussolini in April, and was behind the creation of the paramilitary Black Brigades. Capture and death Pavolini was captured after a desperate escape attempt which saw him swimming across Lake Como and then trapped in a Mexican standoff over a half submerged rock. When Pavolini ran out of bullets, he was finally apprehended and executed by the partisans in Dongo. Before burial, his body was hung upside down in public, along with Mussolini, Mussolini's mistress Clara Petacci, the former Party Secretary Achille Starace, Nicola Bombacci and others in Piazzale Loreto, Milan.

Succeeding Lunalilo, he was elected to the vacant throne of Hawai ªi against Queen Emma. KalƒÅkaua had a convivial personality and enjoyed entertaining guests with his singing and ukulele playing. At his coronation and his birthday jubilee, the hula that had been banned from public in the kingdom became a celebration of Hawaiian culture. During his reign, the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 brought great prosperity to the kingdom. Its renewal continued the prosperity but allowed the United States to have exclusive use of Pearl Harbor. In 1881, he took a trip around the world to encourage the immigration of contract sugar plantation workers. KalƒÅkaua wanted Hawaiians to broaden their education beyond their nation. He instituted a government financed program to sponsor qualified students to be sent abroad to further their education. Two of KalƒÅkaua's projects, the statue of Kamehameha I and the rebuilding of  ªIolani Palace, were expensive endeavors but are popular tourist attractions today. Extravagant expenditures and his plans for a Polynesian confederation played into the hands of annexationists who were already working towards a United States takeover of Hawai ªi. In 1887, he was pressured to sign a new constitution that made the monarchy little more than a figurehead position. He had faith in his sister Lili ªuokalani's abilities to rule as regent when he named her as his heir-apparent following the death of their brother, William Pitt Leleiohoku II, in 1877. After his death, she became the last monarch of Hawai ªi. Early life and family KalƒÅkaua was born at 2:00 a.m. on November 16, 1836, to Caesar Kaluaiku Kapa ªakea and Analea KeohokƒÅlole in the grass hut compound belonging to his maternal grandfather  ªAikanaka, at the base of Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu on the island of O ªahu. Of the ali ªi class of Hawaiian nobility, his family were considered collateral relations of the reigning House of Kamehameha, sharing common descent from the 18th-century ali ªi nui Keawe ªƒ´kekahiali ªiokamoku. From his biological parents, he descended from Keaweaheulu and Kame ªeiamoku, two of the five royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Kingdom of Hawai ªi. Kame ªeiamoku, the grandfather of both his mother and father, was one of the royal twins alongside Kamanawa depicted on the Hawaiian coat of arms.; ; However, KalƒÅkaua and his siblings traced their high rank from their mother's line of descent, referring to themselves as members the \\"Keawe-a-Heulu line\\", although later historians would refer to the family as the House of KalƒÅkaua.; ; ; The second surviving child of a large family, his biological siblings included his elder brother James Kaliokalani, and younger siblings Lydia Kamaka ªeha (later renamed Lili ªuokalani), Anna Ka ªiulani, Ka ªimina ªauao, Miriam Likelike and William Pitt Leleiohoku II. KalƒÅkaua at the age of fourteen, c. 1850 Given the name KalƒÅkaua, which translates into \\"The Day [of] Battle\\", the date of his birth coincided with the signing of the unequal treaty imposed by British Captain Lord Edward Russell of the Actaeon on Kamehameha III. He and his siblings were hƒÅnai (informally adopted) to other family members in the Native Hawaiian tradition. Prior to birth, his parents had promised to give their child in hƒÅnai to Kuini Liliha, a high-ranking chiefess and the widow of High Chief Boki. However, after he was born, High Chiefess Ha ªaheo Kaniu took the baby to Honuakaha, the residence of the king. Kuhina Nui (regent) Elizabeth Kƒ´na ªu, who disliked Liliha, deliberated and decreed his parents to give him to Ha ªaheo and her husband Keaweamahi Kinimaka. When Ha ªaheo died in 1843 she bequeathed all her properties to him. After Ha ªaheo's death, his guardianship was entrusted in his hƒÅnai father, who was a chief of lesser rank; he took KalƒÅkaua to live in LƒÅhainƒÅ. Kinimaka would later marry Pai, a subordinate Tahitian chiefess, who treated KalƒÅkaua as her own until the birth of her own son. Education At the age of four, KalƒÅkaua returned to O ªahu to begin his education at the Chiefs' Children's School (later renamed the Royal School). He and his classmates had been formally proclaimed by Kamehameha III as eligible for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii.; ; His classmates included his siblings James Kaliokalani and Lydia Kamaka ªeha and their thirteen royal cousins including the future kings Kamehameha IV, Kamehameha V and Lunalilo. They were taught by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke.; At the school, KalƒÅkaua became fluent in English and the Hawaiian language and was noted for his fun and humor rather than his academic prowess. The strong-willed boy defended his less robust elder brother Kaliokalani from the older boys at the school. In October 1840, their paternal grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons to visit him on the night before his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. The next morning the Cookes allowed the guardian of the royal children John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ to bring Kaliokalani and KalƒÅkaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not known if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of KalƒÅkaua indicated that the boys witnessed the public hanging of their grandfather at the gallows. Historian Helena G. Allen noted the indifference the Cookes' had toward the request and the traumatic experience it must have been for the boys. After the Cookes retired and closed the school in 1850, he briefly studied at Joseph Watt's English school for native children at Kawaiaha ªo and later joined the relocated day school (also called Royal School) run by Reverend Edward G. Beckwith. Illness prevented him from finishing his schooling and he was sent back to LƒÅhainƒÅ to live with his mother. Following his formal schooling, he studied law under Charles Coffin Harris in 1853. KalƒÅkaua would appoint Harris as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in 1877. Political and military careers KalƒÅkaua, photograph by Joseph W. King, KalƒÅkaua's various military, government and court positions prevented him from fully completing his legal training. He received his earliest military training under the Prussian officer, Major Francis Funk, who instilled an admiration of the Prussian military system. In 1852, Prince Liholiho, who would later reign as Kamehameha IV, appointed Kalakaua as one of his aide-de-camp on his military staff. The following year, he commissioned KalƒÅkaua as brevet captain in the infantry. In the army, KalƒÅkaua served as first lieutenant in his father Kapa ªakea's militia of 240 men and later worked as military secretary to Major John William Elliott Maikai, the adjutant general of the army. He was promoted to major and assigned to the personal staff of Kamehameha IV when the king ascended to the throne in 1855. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1858. He became a personal associate and friend of Prince Lot, the future Kamehameha V, who instilled his mission of \\"Hawaii for Hawaiians\\" in the young KalƒÅkaua. In the fall of 1860, when he was Chief Clerk of the kingdom's Department of the Interior, KalƒÅkaua accompanied Prince Lot, high chief Levi Ha ªalelea and Hawaii's Consul for Peru, Josiah C. Spalding, on a two-month tour of British Columbia and California. They sailed from Honolulu aboard the yacht Emma Rooke, on August 29, arriving on September 18 in Victoria, British Columbia where they were received by the local dignitaries of the city. In California, the party visited San Francisco, Sacramento, Folsom and other local areas where they were honorably received. In 1856, KalƒÅkaua was appointed a member of the Privy Council of State by Kamehameha IV. He was also appointed to the House of Nobles, the upper body of the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1858, serving there until 1873. He served as 3rd Chief Clerk of the Department of the Interior in 1859 under Prince Lot who was Minister of the Interior before becoming king in 1863. He held this position until 1863. On June 30, 1863, KalƒÅkaua was appointed Postmaster General and served until his resignation on March 18, 1865. In 1865, he was appointed the King's Chamberlain and served until 1869 when he resigned to finish his law studies. In 1870, he was admitted to the Hawaiian bar and was hired as a clerk in the Land Office, a post he held until he came to the throne. He was decorated a Knight Companion of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I in 1867. American writer Mark Twain, working as a traveling reporter for the Sacramento Daily Union, visited Hawaii in 1866 during the reign of Kamehameha V. He met the young KalƒÅkaua and other members of the legislature and noted: Marriage Kapi ªolani, the wife and future queen consort of KalƒÅkaua KalƒÅkaua was briefly engaged to marry Princess Victoria KamƒÅmalu, the younger sister of Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V. However, the match was terminated when the princess decided to renew her on-and-off betrothal to her cousin Lunalilo. KalƒÅkaua would later fall in love with Kapi ªolani, the young widow of Bennett NƒÅmƒÅkƒìhƒÅ, the uncle of Kamehameha IV's wife Queen Emma. A descendant of King Kaumuali ªi of Kauai, Kapi ªolani was Queen Emma's lady-in-waiting and Prince Albert Edward Kamehameha's nurse and caretaker. They married on December 19, 1863, in a quiet ceremony conducted by a minister of the Anglican Church of Hawai ªi. The timing of the wedding was heavily criticized since it fell during the official mourning period for King Kamehameha IV. The marriage remained childless. Political ascendancy =1873 election= King Kamehameha V, died on December 12, 1872, without naming a successor to the throne. Under the 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, if the king did not appoint a successor, a new king would be appointed by the legislature to begin a new royal line of succession. There were several candidates for the Hawaiian throne including Bernice Pauahi Bishop, who had been asked to succeed to the throne by Kamehameha V on his deathbed but had declined the offer. However, the contest was centered on the two high-ranking male ali ªi, or chiefs: Lunalilo and KalƒÅkaua. Lunalilo was more popular, partly because he was a higher-ranking chief than KalƒÅkaua and was the immediate cousin of Kamehameha V. Lunalilo was also the more liberal of the two‚Äîhe promised to amend the constitution to give the people a greater voice in the government. According to historian Ralph S. Kuykendall, there was an enthusiasm among Lunalilo's supporters to have him declared king without holding an election. In response, Lunalilo issued a proclamation stating that, even though he believed himself to be the rightful heir to the throne, he would submit to an election for the good of the kingdom. On January 1, 1873, a popular election was held for the office of King of Hawaii. Lunalilo won with an overwhelming majority while KalƒÅkaua performed extremely poorly receiving 12 votes out of the more than 11,000 votes cast. The next day, the legislature confirmed the popular vote and elected Lunalilo unanimously. KalƒÅkaua conceded. =1874 election= Following Lunalilo's ascension, KalƒÅkaua was appointed as colonel on the military staff of the king. He kept politically active during Lunalilo's reign, including leadership involvement with a political organization known as the Young Hawaiians; the group's motto was \\"Hawaii for the Hawaiians\\". He had gained political capital with his staunch opposition to ceding any part of the Hawaiian islands to foreign interests. During the  ªIolani Barracks mutiny by the Royal Guards of Hawaii in September 1873, KalƒÅkaua was suspected to have incited the native guards to rebel against their white officers. Lunalilo responded to the insurrection by disbanding the military unit altogether, leaving Hawaii without a standing army for the remainder of his reign.; ; The issue of succession was a major concern especially since Lunalilo was unmarried and childless at the time. Queen Dowager Emma, the widow of Kamehameha IV, was considered to be Lunalilo's favorite choice as his presumptive heir. On the other hand, KalƒÅkaua and his political cohorts actively campaigned for him to be named successor in the event of the king's death. Among the other candidates considered viable as Lunalilo's successor was the previously mentioned Bernice Pauahi Bishop. She had strong ties to the United States through her marriage to wealthy American businessman Charles Reed Bishop who also served as one of Lunalilo's cabinet ministers. When Lunalilo became ill several months after his election, Native Hawaiians counseled with him to appoint a successor to avoid another election. However he may have personally felt about Emma, he never put it in writing. He failed to act on the issue of a successor, and died on February 3, 1874, setting in motion a bitter election. While Lunalilo did not think of himself as a Kamehameha, his election continued the Kamehameha line to some degree making him the last of the monarchs of the Kamehameha dynasty. Pauahi chose not to run. KalƒÅkaua's political platform was that he would reign in strict accordance with the kingdom's constitution. Emma campaigned on her assurance that Lunalilo had personally told her he wanted her to succeed him. Several individuals who claimed first-hand knowledge of Lunalilo's wishes backed her publicly. With Lunalilo's privy council issuing a public denial of that claim, the kingdom was divided on the issue. British Commissioner James Hay Wodehouse put the British and American forces docked at Honolulu on the alert for possible violence. The election was held on February 12, and KalƒÅkaua was elected by the Legislative Assembly by a margin of thirty-nine to six. His election provoked the Honolulu Courthouse riot where supporters of Queen Emma targeted legislators who supported KalƒÅkaua; thirteen legislators were injured. The kingdom was without an army since the mutiny the year before and many police officers sent to quell the riot joined the mob or did nothing. Unable to control the mob, KalƒÅkaua and Lunalilo's former ministers had to request the aid of American and British military forces docked in the harbor to put down the uprising. Reign Given the unfavorable political climate following the riot, KalƒÅkaua was quickly sworn in the following day, in a ceremony witnessed by government officials, family members, foreign representatives and some spectators. This inauguration ceremony was held at Kƒ´na ªu Hale, the residence of the Royal Chamberlain, instead of Kawaiaha ªo Church, as was customary. The hastiness of the affair would prompt him to hold a coronation ceremony in 1883. Upon ascending to the throne, KalƒÅkaua named his brother, William Pitt Leleiohoku, Leleiohoku II, as his heir-apparent. When Leleiohoku II died in 1877, KalƒÅkaua changed the name of his sister Lydia Dominis to Liliuokalani and designated her as his heir-apparent. From March to May 1874, he toured the main Hawaiian Islands of Kauai, Maui, Hawaii Island, Molokai and Oahu and visited the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement. =Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 and its extension= Illustration of KalƒÅkaua's state dinner at the White House, meeting with President Ulysses S. Grant. Within a year of KalƒÅkaua's election, he helped negotiate the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. This free trade agreement between the United States and Hawaii, allowed sugar and other products to be exported to the US duty free. He led the Reciprocity Commission consisting of sugar planter Henry A. P. Carter of C. Brewer & Co., Hawaii Chief Justice Elisha Hunt Allen, and Minister of Foreign Affairs William Lowthian Green. KalƒÅkaua became the first reigning monarch to visit America. The state dinner in his honor hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant was the first White House state dinner ever held.; Many in the Hawaii business community were willing to cede Pearl Harbor to the United States in exchange for the treaty, but KalƒÅkaua was opposed to the idea. A seven-year treaty was signed on January 30, 1875, without any Hawaiian land being ceded. San Francisco sugar refiner Claus Spreckels became a major investor in Hawaii's sugar industry. Initially he bought half of the first year's production; ultimately he became the plantations' major shareholder. Spreckels became one of KalƒÅkaua's close associates. When it expired, an extension of the treaty was negotiated, giving exclusive use of Pearl Harbor to the United States. Ratifications by both parties took two years and eleven months, and were exchanged on December 9, 1887, extending the agreement for an additional seven years.; Over the term of KalƒÅkaua's reign, the treaty had a major effect on the kingdom's income. In 1874, Hawaii exported $1,839,620.27 in products. The value of exported products in 1890, the last full year of his reign, was $13,282,729.48, an increase of 722%. The export of sugar during that period grew from 24,566,611 pounds to 330,822,879 pounds. =Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad= The Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad was a government-funded educational program during KalƒÅkaua's reign to help students further their education beyond the institutions available in Hawaii at that time. Between 1880 and 1887, KalƒÅkaua selected 18 students for enrollment in a university or apprenticeship to a trade, outside the Kingdom of Hawaii. These students furthered their education in Italy, England, Scotland, China, Japan and California. During the life of the program, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to support it.; ; When the Bayonet Constitution went into effect, the students were recalled to Hawaii. =Trip around the world= Journey of King KalƒÅkaua in 1881 King KalƒÅkaua and his boyhood friends William Nevins Armstrong and Charles Hastings Judd, along with personal cook Robert von Oelhoffen, circumnavigated the globe in 1881. The purpose of the 281-day trip was to encourage the importation of contract labor for plantations. KalƒÅkaua set a world record as the first monarch to travel around the world. He appointed his sister and heir-apparent Liliuokalani to act as Regent during his absence. Setting sail on January 20, they visited California before sailing to Asia. There they spent four months opening contract labor dialogue in Japan and China, while sightseeing and spreading goodwill through nations that were potential sources for workers.; They continued through Southeast Asia, and then headed for Europe in June, where they stayed until mid- September. Their most productive immigration talks were in Portugal, where Armstrong stayed behind to negotiate an expansion of Hawaii's existing treaty with the government. President James A. Garfield in Washington, D.C. had been assassinated in their absence. On their return trip to the United States, KalƒÅkaua paid a courtesy call on Garfield's successor President Chester A. Arthur. Before embarking on a train ride across the United States, KalƒÅkaua visited Thomas Edison for a demonstration of electric lighting, discussing its potential use in Honolulu.; They departed for Hawaii from San Francisco on October 22, arriving in Honolulu on October 31. His homecoming celebration went on for days. He had brought the small island nation to the attention of world leaders, but the trip had sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. In Hawaii there were critics who believed the labor negotiations were just his excuse to see the world. Eventually his efforts bore fruit in increased contract labor for Hawaii.; ; Thomas Thrum's Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883 reported KalƒÅkaua's tour expense appropriated by the government as $22,500, although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on. = ªIolani Palace= \\"[T]he working tools of a mason\\" presented to KalƒÅkaua by the freemasons on December 31, 1879 on display in the palace basement 'Iolani Palace is the only royal palace on US soil. The first palace was a coral and wood structure which served primarily as office space for the kingdom's monarchs beginning with Kamehameha III in 1845. By the time KalƒÅkaua became king, the structure had decayed, and he ordered it destroyed to be replaced with a new building. During the 1878 session of the legislature Finance Chairman Walter Murray Gibson, a political supporter of KalƒÅkaua's, pushed through appropriations of $50,000 for the new palace. Construction began in 1879, with an additional $80,000 appropriated later to furnish it and complete the construction.; Three architects worked on the design, Thomas J. Baker, Charles J. Wall and Isaac Moore. December 31, 1879, the 45th birthday of Queen Kapi ªolani, was the date KalƒÅkaua chose for the ceremonial laying of the cornerstone. Minister of Foreign Affairs John MƒÅkini Kapena delivered the ceremony's formal address in Hawaiian. As Master of the Freemason Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie, KalƒÅkaua charged the freemasons with orchestrating the ceremonies. The parade preceding the laying of the cornerstone involved every civilian and military organization in Hawaii. The Pacific Commercial Advertiser noted it was \\"one of the largest seen in Honolulu for some years\\". A copper time capsule containing photographs, documents, currency, and the Hawaiian census was sealed inside the cornerstone. After speeches had been made, the freemasons presented the king with \\"the working tools of a mason\\", a plumb bob, level, square tool, and a trowel. In between the laying of the cornerstone and the finishing of the new palace, KalƒÅkaua had seen how other monarchs lived. He wanted  ªIolani to measure up to the standards of the rest of the world. The furnishing and interiors of the finished palace were reflective of that. Immediately upon completion, the king invited all 120 members of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie to the palace for a lodge meeting.; KalƒÅkaua had also seen during his visit to Edison's studio how effective electric lighting could be for the kingdom. On July 21, 1886,  ªIolani Palace led the way with the first electric lights in the kingdom, showcasing the technology. The monarch invited the public to attend a lighting ceremony on the palace grounds, attracting 5,000 spectators. The Royal Hawaiian Band entertained, refreshments were served, and the king paraded his troops around the grounds. The total cost of building and furnishing the new palace was $343,595. =1883 coronation= KalƒÅkaua and Kapi ªolani had been denied a coronation ceremony in 1874 because of the civil unrest following the election. Under Finance Chairman Gibson, the 1880 legislature appropriated $10,000 for a coronation. Gibson was believed to be the main proponent behind the event. On October 10, 1882, the Saturday Press indicated that not all the public was in favor of the coronation. By this point, Gibson's role in the kingdom's finances and his influence on KalƒÅkaua were beginning to come under scrutiny: \\"Our versatile Premier ... is pulling another string in this puppet farce.\\" At the same time, the newspaper rebuked many of the recent actions and policies not only of Gibson but of the King's cabinet in general.; The coronation ceremony and related celebratory events were spread out over a two- week period. A special octagon-shaped pavilion and grandstand were built for the February 12, 1883, ceremony. Preparations were made for an anticipated crowd exceeding 5,000, with lawn chairs to accommodate any overflow. Before the actual event, a procession of 630 adults and children paraded from downtown to the palace. KalƒÅkaua and Kapi ªolani, accompanied by their royal retinue, came out of the palace onto the event grounds. The coronation was preceded by a choir singing and the formal recitation of the King's official titles. The news coverage noted, \\"The King looked ill at ease.\\" Chief Justice of Hawaii's Supreme Court Albert Francis Judd officiated and delivered the oath of office to the king. The crown was then handed to KalƒÅkaua, and he placed it upon his head. The ceremony ended with the choir singing, and a prayer. A planned post-coronation reception by KalƒÅkaua and Kapi ªolani was cancelled without advance notice. Today, KalƒÅkaua's coronation pavilion serves as the bandstand for the Royal Hawaiian Band. Following the ceremony, KalƒÅkaua unveiled the Kamehameha Statue in front of Aliiolani Hale, the government building, with Gibson delivering the unveiling speech. This statue was a second replica. Originally intended for the centennial of Captain James Cook's landing in Hawaii, the statue, which was the brainchild of Gibson, had been cast by Thomas Ridgeway Gould but had been lost during shipment off the Falkland Islands. By the time the replica arrived, the intended date had passed, and it was decided to unveil the statue as part of the coronation ceremony. Later, the original statue was salvaged and restored. It was sent to Kohala, Hawaii, Kamehameha's birthplace, where it was unveiled by the king on May 8. The legislature had allocated $10,000 for the first statue and insured it for $12,000. A further $7,000 was allocated for the second statue with an additional $4,000 from the insurance money spent to add four bas relief panels depicting historic moments during Kamehamena's reign.; That evening, the royal couple hosted a state dinner, and there was a luau at a later day. The hula was performed nightly on the palace grounds. Regattas, horse races and a number of events filled the celebration period. Due to weather conditions, the planned illumination of the palace and grounds for the day of the coronation happened a week later, and the public was invited to attend. Fireworks displays lit up the sky at the palace and at Punchbowl Crater. A grand ball was held the evening of February 20. Although exact figures are unknown, historian Kuykendall stated that the final cost of the coronation exceeded $50,000. =KalƒÅkaua coinage= thumb The KalƒÅkaua coinage was minted to boost Hawaiian pride. At this time, United States gold coins had been accepted for any debt over $50; any debt under $50 was payable by US silver coins. In 1880, the legislature passed a currency law that allowed it to purchase bullion for the United States mint to produce Hawaii's own coins. The design would have the King's image on the obverse side, with Hawaii's coat of arms and motto \\"Ua Mau ke Ea o ka  ªƒÄina i ka Pono\\" on the reverse. In a deal with Claus Spreckels, he sponsored the minting by purchasing the required silver. In return, he was guaranteed an equal amount of six percent gold bonds, thereby giving him a guaranteed profit. When Hawaii's silver coins began circulating in December 1883, the business community was reluctant to accept them, fearing they would drive US gold coins out of the market. Spreckels opened his own bank to circulate them. Business owners feared economic inflation and lost faith in the government, as did foreign governments. Political fallout from the coinage led to the 1884 election-year shift towards the Kuokoa (independent) Party in the legislature. It passed the Currency Act to restrict acceptance of silver coin as payment for debts under $10. Exchange of silver for gold at the treasury was then limited to $150,000 a month. In 1903, the Hawaii silver coins were redeemed for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint. =Birthday Jubilee, November 15‚Äì29, 1886= KalƒÅkaua's 50th birthday on November 16, 1886, was celebrated with a two-week jubilee. Gibson had by this time joined the King's cabinet as prime minister of Hawaii. He and Minister of the Interior Luther Aholo put forth a motion for the legislature to form a committee to oversee the birthday jubilee on September 20. The motion was approved, and at Gibson's subsequent request, the legislature appropriated $15,000 for the jubilee. An announcement was made on November 3 that all government schools would be closed the week of November 15. Gifts for the king began arriving on November 15. At midnight, the jubilee officially began with fireworks at the Punchbowl Crater. At sunrise, the kingdom's police force arrived at  ªIolani Palace to pay tribute, followed by the king's Cabinet, Supreme Court justices, the kingdom's diplomats, and officials of government departments. School student bodies and civic organizations also paid tribute. The Royal Hawaiian Band played throughout the day. In the afternoon, the doors of the palace were opened to all the officials and organizations, and the public. In the evening, the palace was aglow with lanterns, candles and electric lighting throwing \\"a flood of radiance over the Palace and grounds\\". The evening ended with a Fireman's Parade and fireworks. Throughout the next two weeks, there was a regatta, a Jubilee ball, a luau, athletic competitions, a state dinner, and a marksmanship contest won by the Honolulu Rifles.; ; ; Harper's Weekly reported in 1891 that the final cost of the jubilee was $75,000. = Military policy = Kalakaua with his military staff officers, 1882 During the early part of his reign, KalƒÅkaua restored the Household Guards which had been defunct since his predecessor Lunalilo abolished the unit in 1874. Initially the king created three volunteer companies: the Leleiohoku Guard, a cavalry unit; the Prince's Own, an artillery unit; and the Hawaiian Guards, an infantry unit.; By the latter part of his reign, the army of the Kingdom of Hawaii consisted of six volunteer companies including: the King's Own, the Queen's Own, the Prince's Own, the Leleiohoku Guard, the Mamalahoa Guard and the Honolulu Rifles, and the regular troops of the King's Household Guard. The ranks of these regiments were composed mainly of Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian officers with a few white officers including his brother-in-law John Owen Dominis. Each unit was subject to call for active service when necessary. The king and the governor of Oahu also had their own personal staff of military officers with the ranks of colonel and major. On October 1, 1886, the Military Act of 1886 was passed which created a Department of War and a Department of the Navy under the Minister of Foreign Affairs who would also serve as Secretary of War and of the Navy. Dominis was appointed lieutenant general and commander-in-chief and other officers were commissioned while the king was made the supreme commander and generalissimo of the Hawaiian Army.; ; Around this time, the government also bought and commissioned His Hawaiian Majesty's Ship (HHMS) Kaimiloa, the first and only vessel of the Hawaiian Royal Navy, under the command of Captain George E. Gresley Jackson. After 1887, the military commissions creating Dominis and his staff officers were recalled for economic reasons and the Military Act of 1886 was later declared unconstitutional. The Military Act of 1888 was passed reducing the size of the army to four volunteer companies: the Honolulu Rifles, the King's Own, the Queen's Own, the Prince's Own, and the Leleiohoku Guard. In 1890, another military act further restricted the army to just the King's Royal Guards. =Polynesian confederation= Portrait of Kalakaua The idea of Hawaii's involvement in the internal affairs of Polynesian nations had been around at least two decades before KalƒÅkaua's election, when Australian Charles St Julian volunteered to be a political liaison to Hawaii in 1853. He accomplished nothing of any significance. KalƒÅkaua's interest in forming a Polynesian coalition, with him at the head, was influenced by both Walter M. Gibson and Italian soldier of fortune Celso Caesar Moreno. In 1879 Moreno urged the king to create such a realm with Hawaii at the top of the empire, \\" ... uniting under your sceptre the whole Polynesian race and mak[ing] Honolulu a monarchical Washington, where the representatives of all the islands would convene in Congress.\\" In response to the activities of Germany and Great Britain in Oceania, Gibson's Pacific Commercial Advertiser urged Hawaii's involvement in protecting the island nations from international aggression. Gibson was appointed to KalƒÅkaua's cabinet as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1882. In 1883, he introduced the approved legislation to convey in writing to foreign governments that Hawaii fully supported the independence of Polynesian nations. The subsequent \\"Hawaiian protest\\" letter he drafted was mostly ignored by nations that received it. The Daily Bulletin in Honolulu issued its own response, \\"Hawaii's true policy is to confine her attention to herself, ...\\". The Hawaiian Gazette criticized Gibson's character and mockingly referred to the proposed venture as the \\"Empire of the Calabash\\". Hawaiian envoys and Malietoa Laupepa on board of the Kaimiloa in 1887. In 1885, Gibson dispatched Minister to the United States Henry A. P. Carter to Washington D. C. and Europe to convey Hawaii's intentions towards Polynesia. Carter made little headway with Gibson's instructions. He pushed for direct intervention into a political upheaval in Samoa, where the German Empire backed rebels under their leader Tamasese in an attempt to overthrow King Malietoa Laupepa. In an effort to keep him in power, Gibson convinced the 1886 legislature to allocate $100,000 to purchase the steamship Zealandia, $50,000 for its operating expenses, and $35,000 for foreign missions. United States special commissioner to Samoa, George H. Bates advised KalƒÅkaua that Hawaii should mind its own business and stay out of Samoan affairs. Instead, Hawaii sent a delegation headed by John E. Bush to Samoa, where Samoan King Malietoa Laupepa signed a Samoan-Hawaiian confederation treaty on February 17, 1887.; Bush also presented Malietoa with the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania, which Kalakaua had created to honor the monarchs and chiefs of the Polynesian confederation. The government sent HHMS Kaimiloa for Bush's use in visiting the chiefs of the other islands of Polynesia.; The United States and Great Britain joined with Germany in expressing their disapproval of the treaty. Germany warned the United States and Great Britain, \\"In case Hawaii ... should try to interfere in favor of Malietoa, the King of the Sandwich Islands would thereby enter into [a] state of war with us.\\" When German warships arrived in Samoan waters, Malietoa surrendered and was sent into exile. The Kaimiloa and Bush's delegation were recalled to Honolulu after the ousting of the Gibson administration. KalƒÅkaua's later explanation of Hawaii's interference in Samoa was, \\"Our Mission was simply a Mission of phylanthropy [sic] more than any thing, but the arogance [sic] of the Germans prevented our good intentions and . . . we had to withdraw the Mission.\\" 1887 Bayonet Constitution In Memoirs of the Hawaiian Revolution, Sanford B. Dole devoted a chapter to the Bayonet Constitution. He stated that King KalƒÅkaua appointed cabinet members not for their ability to do the job, but for their ability to bend to his will. Consequently, according to Dole, appropriated funds were shifted from one account to another, \\"for fantastic enterprises and for the personal aggrandizement of the royal family.\\" Dole placed much of the blame on Gibson, and accused KalƒÅkaua of taking a bribe of $71,000 from Tong Kee to grant an opium license, an action done via one of the king's political allies Junius Ka ªae. Despite his own personal opposition, Kalakaua signed a legislative bill in 1886 creating a single opium vending and distribution license. Ka ªae had suggested to rice planter Tong Kee, also known as Aki, that a monetary gift to the king might help him acquire it. Aki took the suggestion and gave thousands of dollars to the king.; ; ; Another merchant, Chun Lung, made the government an offer of $80,000.00 which forced Aki to raise even more cash. The license was eventually awarded to Chun who withheld his payment until the license was actually signed over to him on December 31, 1886. KalƒÅkaua admitted that he had been overruled by his cabinet who were friendly with Chun. After the reform party took control of the government, the opium license debt remained unpaid. KalƒÅkaua agreed to make restitution for his debts via revenues from the Crown Lands. However, other liabilities and outstanding debt forced him to sign his debt over to trustees who would control all of KalƒÅkaua's private estates and Crown Land revenues. When trustees refused to add the opium debt, Aki sued. Although the court ruled, \\"The king could do no wrong\\", the trustees were found liable for the debt. The Hawaiian League was formed to change the status quo of government \\"by all means necessary\\", and had joined forces with the Honolulu Rifles militia group. Anticipating a coup d'√©tat, the king took measures to save himself by dismissing Gibson and his entire cabinet on June 28. Fearing an assassination was not out of the question, KalƒÅkaua barricaded himself inside the palace. The Hawaiian League presented a June 30 resolution demanding the king's restitution for the alleged bribe. Also known as the \\"committee of thirteen\\", it was composed of: Paul Isenberg, William W. Hall, James A. Kennedy, William Hyde Rice, Captain James A. King, E. B. Thomas, H. C. Reed, John Mark Vivas, W. P. A. Brewer, Rev. W. B. Oleson, Cecil Brown, Captain George Ross and Joseph Ballard Atherton. The new appointed cabinet members were William Lowthian Green as prime minister and minister of finance, Clarence W. Ashford as attorney general, Lorrin A. Thurston as minister of the interior, and Godfrey Brown as minister of foreign affairs. A new constitution was drafted immediately by the Hawaiian Committee and presented to KalƒÅkaua for his signature on July 6. The next day he issued a proclamation of the abrogation of the 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The new constitution was nicknamed the Bayonet Constitution because of the duress under which it was signed. His sister Liliuokalani stated in Hawaii's Story that her brother was convinced that if he did not sign, he would be assassinated. She wrote that he no longer knew who was friend or foe. He felt betrayed by people he once trusted and had told her that everywhere he went he was under constant surveillance. The Bayonet Constitution allowed the King to appoint his cabinet but placed that cabinet under the sole authority of the legislature. It required any executive actions of the monarch to be approved by the cabinet. Previous suffrage (voting rights) was restricted to male subjects of the kingdom regardless of race. The new constitution restricted suffrage only to Hawaiian, American or European men residing in Hawaii, if they were 21 years old, literate with no back unpaid taxes, and would take an oath to support the law of the land. By placing a new minimum qualifier of $3,000 in property ownership and a minimum income of $600 for voters of the House of Nobles, the new constitution disqualified many poor Native Hawaiians from voting for half of the legislature. Naturalized Asians were deprived of the vote for both houses of the legislature. Gibson was arrested on July 1 and charged with embezzlement of public funds. The case was soon dropped for lack of evidence. Gibson fled to California on July 12, and died there 6 months later on January 21, 1888. When the new constitution went into effect, state- sponsored students studying abroad were recalled. One of those was Robert William Wilcox who had been sent to Italy for military training. Wilcox's initial reaction to the turn of events was advocating Liliuokalani be installed as Regent. On July 30, 1889, however, he and Robert Napu ªuako Boyd, another state-sponsored student, led a rebellion aimed at restoring the 1864 constitution, and, thereby, the king's power. KalƒÅkaua, possibly fearing Wilcox intended to force him to abdicate in favor of his sister, was not in the palace when the insurrection happened. The government's military defense led to the surrender of the Wilcox's insurgents. Death and succession USS Charleston en route to San Francisco KalƒÅkaua sailed for California aboard the USS Charleston on November 25, 1890. Accompanying him were his trusted friends George W. Macfarlane and Robert Hoapili Baker. There was uncertainty about the purpose of the king's trip. Minister of Foreign Affairs John Adams Cummins reported the trip was solely for the king's health and would not extend beyond California. Local newspapers and British commissioner Wodehouse worried the king might go farther east to Washington, DC, to negotiate a continued cession of Pearl Harbor to the United States after the expiration of the reciprocity treaty or possible annexation of the kingdom. His sister Lili ªuokalani, after unsuccessfully dissuading him from departing, wrote he meant to discuss the McKinley Tariff with the Hawaiian ambassador to the United States HenryA.P.Carter in Washington. She was again appointed to serve as regent during his absence.; ; Upon arriving in California, the party landed in San Francisco on December 5. KalƒÅkaua, whose health had been declining, stayed in a suite at the Palace Hotel. Traveling throughout Southern California and Northern Mexico, he suffered a minor stroke in Santa Barbara and was rushed back to San Francisco. He was placed under the care of George W. Woods, surgeon of the United States Pacific Fleet. Against the advice of Dr. Woods, KalƒÅkaua insisted on going to his initiation at the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (A.A.O.N.M.S.) on January 14. He was given a tonic of Vin Mariani that got him on his feet, and was accompanied to the rites by an escort from the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. The ceremonies did not take long, and he was returned to his suite within an hour. Two days before his death, he lapsed into a coma. KalƒÅkaua died at 2:35 pm on Tuesday, January 20, 1891. US Navy officials listed the official cause of death as Bright's Disease (inflammation of the kidneys).; ; His last words were, \\"Aue, he kanaka au, eia i loko o ke kukonukonu o ka ma ªi!,\\" or \\"Alas, I am a man who is seriously ill.\\" The more popular quote, \\"Tell my people I tried\\", attributed as his last words, was actually invented by novelist Eugene Burns in his 1952 biography of KalƒÅkaua, The Last King of Paradise. Shortly before his death his voice was recorded on a phonograph cylinder, which is now in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. The news of KalƒÅkaua's death did not reach Hawaii until January 29 when the Charleston returned to Honolulu with the king's remains.; As his designated heir-apparent, Liliuokalani ascended to the throne the same day. After a state funeral in California and a second one in Honolulu, the king's remains were buried in the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna  ªAla on February 15, 1891. In a ceremony officiated by his sister Lili ªuokalani on June 24, 1910, his remains, and those of his family, were transferred to the underground KalƒÅkaua Crypt after the main mausoleum building had been converted into a chapel. Legacy KalƒÅkaua's reign is generally regarded as the first Hawaiian Renaissance, for both his influence on Hawaii's music, and for other contributions he made to reinvigorate Hawaiian culture. His actions inspired the reawakening Hawaiian pride and nationalism for the kingdom.; ; During the earlier reign of Christian convert Ka ªahumanu, dancing the hula was forbidden and punishable by law. Subsequent monarchs gradually began allowing the hula, but it was KalƒÅkaua who brought it back in full force. Chants, meles and the hula were part of the official entertainment at KalƒÅkaua's coronation and his birthday jubilee. He issued an invitation to all Hawaiians with knowledge of the old meles and chants to participate in the coronation, and arranged for musicologist A. Marques to observe the celebrations. KalƒÅkaua's cultural legacy lives on in the Merrie Monarch Festival, a large-scale annual hula competition in Hilo, Hawaii, begun in 1964 and named in his honor. A composer of the ancient chants or mele, for the first time KalƒÅkaua published a written version of the Kumulipo, a 2,102-line chant that had traditionally been passed down orally. It traces the royal lineage and the creation of the cosmos.; He is also known to have revived the Hawaiian martial art of Lua, and surfing. The Hawaiian Board of Health (different from the governmental Board of Health) passed by the 1886 legislature consisted of five Native Hawaiians, appointed by KalƒÅkaua, who oversaw the licensing and regulation of the traditional practice of native healing arts. He also appointed Emma Kaili Metcalf Beckley Nakuina as the first Native Hawaiian curator of the Hawaiian National Museum and increased funding for the institution. In 1886, KalƒÅkaua had his Privy Council license the ancient Hale NauƒÅ Society for persons of Hawaiian ancestry. The original Hale Naua had not been active since Kamehameha I, when it had functioned as a genealogical research organization for claims of royal lineage. When KalƒÅkaua reactivated it, he expanded its purpose to encompass Hawaiian culture as well as modern-day arts and sciences and included women as equals. The ranks of the society grew to more than 200 members, and was a political support for KalƒÅkaua that lasted until his death in 1891. In 2004, the National Museum of Natural History displayed KalƒÅkaua's red-and-yellow feathered Hale Naua  ªahu ªula and feathered kƒÅhili as part of its Hawaiian special exhibit. KalƒÅkaua's sponsorship of and brief career in the Hawaiian language press gave him the additional epithet of the \\"Editor King\\". From 1861 to 1863, KalƒÅkaua with G. W. Mila, J. W. H. Kauwahi and John K. Kaunamano co- edited Ka Hoku o ka Pakipika (The Star of the Pacific), the first Hawaiian language newspaper solely written by Native Hawaiians without the influence of American missionaries. This nationalist paper focused on Hawaiian topics especially traditional folklore and poetry.; ; In 1870 he also edited the daily newspaper Ka Manawa (Times), which concerned itself with international news, local news and genealogies but only lasted for two months. He also sponsored the literary journal, Ka Hoku o Ke Kai (The Star of the Sea), which ran from 1883 to 1884. The Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame honored KalƒÅkaua and his brother and sisters as Na Lani  ªEhƒÅ (\\"The Heavenly Four\\") for their patronage and enrichment of Hawaii's musical culture and history. \\"Hawai ªi Pono ªƒ´\\" was officially designated the Hawaii state anthem in 1967. Originally titled \\"Hymn to KamehamehaI\\", Henri Berger, leader of the Royal Hawaiian Band, wrote the instrumental melody in 1872, influenced by the Prussian anthem \\"Heil dir im Siegerkranz\\". KalƒÅkaua added the lyrics in 1874, and the Kawaiaha ªo Church Choir sang it on his birthday that year. In 1876, it became the official anthem of the Kingdom of Hawaii until the overthrow of the monarchy.; ; Other works by the king include \\"Sweet Lei Lehua\\", \\" ªAkahi Ho ªi\\", \\"E Nihi Ka Hele\\", \\"Ka Momi\\", and \\"Koni Au I Ka Wai\\". Seven of his songs were published in Ka Buke O Na Leo Mele Hawaii (1888) using the pseudonym \\"Figgs\\". He generally wrote only the lyrics for most of his surviving works.; ; ; ; ; He established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Serbia and was awarded the Order of Cross of Takovo. King KalƒÅkaua, Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson, and \\"KalƒÅkaua's Singing Boys\\", his own personal headed choir, c. 1889 The ukulele was introduced to the Hawaiian islands during the reign of KalƒÅkaua, by Manuel Nunes, Jos√© do Esp√≠rito Santo, and Augusto Dias, Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. The king became proficient on the instrument. According to American journalist Mary Hannah Krout and Hawaii resident Isobel Osbourne Strong, wife of artist Joseph Dwight Strong and stepdaughter of Robert Louis Stevenson, he would often play the ukulele and perform meles for his visitors, accompanied by his personal musical group KalƒÅkaua's Singing Boys (aka King's Singing Boys). Strong recalled the Singing Boys as \\"the best singers and performers on the ukulele and guitar in the whole islands\\". KalƒÅkaua was inducted into the Ukulele Hall of Fame in 1997. KalƒÅkaua Avenue was created in March 1905 by the House and Senate of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature. It renamed the highway known as Waikiki Road, \\"to commemorate the name of his late Majesty KalƒÅkaua, during whose reign Hawaii made great advancement in material prosperity\\".; The King David Kalakaua Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 under its former name U.S. Post Office, Customhouse, and Courthouse. Located at 335 Merchant Street in Honolulu, it was once the official seat of administration for the Territory of Hawaii. The building was renamed for KalƒÅkaua in 2003. In 1985, a bronze statue of KalƒÅkaua was donated to the City and County of Honolulu to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the arrival of the first Japanese laborers after the king's visit to Japan. It was commissioned by the Oahu Kanyaku Imin Centennial Committee on behalf of the Japanese-American community of Hawaii. The statue was designed and created by musician Palani Vaughan, architect Leland Onekea and Native Hawaiian sculptor Sean Kekamakupaa Kaonohiokalani Lee Loy Browne. It is located at the corner of Kalakaua and Kuhio avenues in Waikiki.; A Hawaiian song about KalƒÅkaua can be heard in the Disney movie Lilo & Stitch when Lilo is introduced in the movie. The mele was written as a mele inoa, its original title being \\"He Inoa No Kalani KalƒÅkaua Kulele\\" (a namesong for the chief, KalƒÅkaua). On the Lilo & Stitch soundtrack, it was retitled as \\"He Mele No Lilo\\". = Notable published works = * Na Mele Aimoku, Na Mele Kupuna, a Me Na Mele Ponoi O Ka Moi KalƒÅkaua I.

It was disbanded in 1818.  History  Francis Grose, who commanded the regiment in its early years = Formation = The regiment was formed in England in June 1789 as a permanent unit to relieve the New South Wales Marine Corps, who had accompanied the First Fleet to Australia. The regiment began arriving as guards on the Second Fleet in 1790. The regiment, led by Major Francis Grose, consisted of three companies numbering about 300 men. Although drafts were sent from Britain to reinforce the regiment throughout its time in Australia, full strength was never to exceed 500. A fourth company was raised from those Marines wishing to remain in New South Wales under Captain George Johnston, who had been Governor Arthur Phillip's aide-de-camp.. When Phillip returned to England for respite in December 1792, Grose was left in charge. Grose immediately abandoned Phillip's plans for governing the colony. A staunch military man, he established military rule and set out to secure the authority of the Corps. He abolished the civilian courts and transferred the magistrates to the authority of Captain Joseph Foveaux. After the poor crops of 1793 he cut the rations of the convicts but not those of the Corps, overturning Phillip's policy of equal rations for all. In a connived attempt to improve agricultural production and make the colony more self-sufficient, Grose turned away from collective farming and made generous land grants to officers of the Corps. They were also provided with government-fed and clothed convicts as farm labour. = Rum trading= Grose also relaxed Phillip's prohibition on trading of rum (sometimes a generic term for any form of distilled beverage, usually made from wheat), usually from Bengal. The colony, like many British territories at the time, was short of coins, and rum soon became the medium of trade. The officers of the Corps were able to use their position and wealth to buy all the imported rum and then exchange it for goods and labour at very favourable rates, thus earning the Corps the nickname \\"The Rum Corps\\". By 1793 stills were being imported and grain was being used to make rum, exacerbating the shortage of grain. Due to poor health Grose returned to England in December 1794 and Captain William Paterson assumed temporary command until a permanent replacement, Governor John Hunter, arrived in September 1795. Paterson had obtained his commission with the backing of Sir Joseph Banks because he was interested in natural history and would explore and collect samples for Banks and the Royal Society. Governor Hunter attempted unsuccessfully to use the troops of the Corps to guard imported rum and stop the officers from buying it up. Attempts to stop the importation were also thwarted by the failure of other governments to co-operate and by the Corps' officers chartering of a Danish ship to bring in a large shipment of rum from India. Hunter also tried to start up a public store with goods from England to provide competition and stabilise the price of goods, but Hunter was not a good businessman and supplies were too erratic. Hunter requested greater control by authorities in England and an excise duty on rum. He also issued an order restricting the amount of convict labour that officers could use, but again had no means to enforce it. Hunter was opposed strongly by officers of the Corps, and pamphlets and letters against him were circulated. John Macarthur wrote a letter accusing Hunter of ineffectiveness and trading in rum. Hunter was required by the Colonial Office to answer the charges, and soon after was recalled for being ineffective. In 1799 Paterson, now a Lieutenant Colonel, returned from England with orders to stamp out the trading in rum by officers of the Corps. In 1800 he charged Major George Johnston, who had also served as Hunter's aide-de-camp, with giving a sergeant part payment in rum at an exorbitant rate. Johnston claimed he was being unfairly persecuted and demanded that he be sent to England for trial. The English courts decided that colonial affairs were not a matter for them and, as all the evidence and witnesses were in Sydney, that any trial should be held there. They also decided that, as proper court martial could not be constituted in Sydney, no further action should be taken against Johnston. Governor Philip King, appointed in September 1800, continued Hunter's efforts to prevent the Corps trading in rum. He had the power to levy an excise duty on alcohol, and the Transit Board now required all ships to lodge a bond which was forfeit for disobeying the Governor's orders, which included the prohibition of the landing of more than 500 gallons of rum. King also encouraged private importers and traders, opened a public brewery in 1804, and introduced a schedule of values for Indian copper and Spanish pieces of eight which were used as currency; there was still a serious problem keeping the coin in the colony despite it being valued higher than its face value. King's actions were not wholly effective but they still antagonised officers of the Corps, and like Hunter he was the subject of pamphlets and attacks. King tried, unsuccessfully, to court-martial the officers responsible. = The Battle of Vinegar Hill = A cartoon painting done some years later of the Battle of Vinegar Hill, artist unknown, from the thumb The Corps were called into action responding to the Battle of Vinegar Hill (named after a revolt in Ireland). Late on 4 March 1804, a great number of Irish rebels rose up at the government farm at Castle Hill, armed themselves with muskets and pikes from surrounding farms, and planned to sack Parramatta and take Sydney Town. Some say they then intended to take ships and sail back to Ireland, others say the intention was to declare the Republic of New Ireland two weeks later on St. Patrick's Day. An alarm at around 11pm raised Major Johnston from his sleep; he then led 29 soldiers of the New South Wales Corps on a forced march from their barracks at Annandale to Parramatta. They arrived around dawn and then later in the morning, with 50 militia of the Loyal Volunteers, they pursued the rebels who were now heading to Green Hills, today's Windsor.. At a feigned meeting with the rebels aided by a priest as lure, Johnston took the ringleaders hostage and when they and their men refused to surrender, to the shouts of 'death or liberty' the troops quickly put down the revolt. Over the next three days repercussions and summary justice reigned. Governor King highly commended Major Johnston for his actions, even though King had to intervene directly to stop a military kangaroo court from hanging one in ten of the rebels. At midnight on 4 March, Captain Daniel Woodriff of landed 150 of his crew to assist the New South Wales Corps and Governor King. =Rum rebellion= Governor King had been requesting a replacement, for at least a year, and eventually Governor William Bligh was appointed in 1805. Although the economy had developed and diversified somewhat by 1806, Bligh arrived determined to bring the Corps, and especially John Macarthur, to heel, and stop their trading in rum. This led to the Rum Rebellion, the deposing of Bligh, and the eventual recall of the New South Wales Corps. In 1808, the New South Wales Corps was renamed the 102nd Regiment of Foot. Having arrived in the colony in December 1809 with the 73rd Regiment of Foot, which was to take over from the 102nd Regiment of Foot, Governor Lachlan Macquarie was able to control the rum trade more effectively, introducing and enforcing a licensing system. However, due to the lack of currency he was still forced to pay for public works in rum. The construction of Sydney Hospital was entirely funded by granting a monopoly on the import of rum to the contractors, who were the merchants Alexander Riley and Garnham Blaxcell, and the colonial surgeon D'Arcy Wentworth, and troops were used to prohibit the landing of rum anywhere but at the hospital dock. A few of the officers and long-serving privates in the 102nd Regiment were transferred to Macquarie's 73rd regiment, bringing it up to near full strength. About 100 veterans and invalids were retained for garrison duty in New South Wales.. =War of 1812= Most of the regiment embarked for England in May 1810. In England, most of the returnees went to Veteran or Garrison battalions, most officers ending up in the 8th Royal Veteran Battalion. The regiment was reconstituted with new recruits after it arrived at its new base in Horsham in October 1810. It was sent to Guernsey in July 1811. The regiment was posted to Bermuda in 1812 and transferred to Nova Scotia in 1813. In the War of 1812 the regiment took part in seaborne raids along the US Atlantic coast. Detachments of the regiment remained on both sides of the border between the British colony of New Brunswick and the US State of Maine after the war's end in December 1814 at Moose Island, modern day Eastport, Maine, USA. After the end of the wars against Napoleonic France and the United States, the British Army disbanded many units for the sake of economy. The regiment was renumbered as the 100th Regiment of Foot in 1816. The regiment was the last British unit to occupy the United States; the last detachments returned to Chatham in England, where the regiment was disbanded on 24 March 1818.

It is located at the southern end of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Sydney. Haymarket includes much of Sydney's Chinatown, Thaitown and Railway Square localities. Haymarket is adjacent to Darling Harbour and is surrounded by the suburbs of Ultimo, Chippendale, Surry Hills and the Sydney CBD. History Crystal Palace Hotel, erected in the 1900s Sydney's produce markets were located in Haymarket from the early 20th century through to the 1980s when they were moved to a new site at Flemington. Paddy's Markets still operate on part of the site of the vegetable markets as a produce and flea market. The 'Market City' complex contains the markets, The Peak apartment building, a modern shopping centre featuring a food court, restaurants, boutiques, specialty shops and entertainment options, such as a cinema and amusement centre. The outer walls of the original vegetable market, built in 1909, were preserved and restored as an example of Edwardian architecture. They were part of the original city markets‚Äîdesigned by city architect C.Broderick‚Äîwhich were bounded by Hay Street, Quay Street and Thomas Street. They were built to replace the old Belmore Market, which had failed because it was too far from Darling Harbour. The new markets included the Sydney City Markets building (Ultimo Road), designed by George McRae and built in 1910, and the Sydney Markets Bell Tower (Quay Street), built in 1911 and restored by the State Bank in 1985. The bell tower is now incorporated within the University of Technology Sydney.Sydney Architecture, John Haskell (UNSW Press) 1997, p.55 By the 1920s, Sydney's \\"Chinatown\\" had moved to Haymarket from the Rocks and Market Street near Darling Harbour. Haymarket became a commercial and community centre for the Chinese community who lived in large numbers in this area and nearby areas such as Surry Hills. With the relocation of the produce market to Flemington and outflow of residents to the suburbs, the commercial role of Haymarket declined. The City of Sydney authorities embarked on a project to establish Haymarket as a tourist-oriented Chinatown. In the 1980s, Dixon Street was pedestrianised, and nearby redevelopments were steered towards creating the atmosphere of an \\"authentic\\" Chinatown. This included the construction of Chinese paifang-style gates, with stone lions, on Dixon Street, and other Chinese-style street furniture, as well as encouraging Chinese restaurants to open along Dixon Street. Despite significant demographic change due to successive waves of immigration from Asia, today's Chinatown remains a centre for Asian restaurants and other businesses. The Capitol Theatre, built in 1928, is also located in Haymarket.

The median age was 27 years and 49.7% of people were aged 20‚Äì29 years. More than half of Haymarket residents were attending an educational institution, with the majority of these people attending a tertiary or technical institution. Just 8.3% of residents were born in Australia. 87.8% of the population was foreign born in 2011, the highest for any Australian suburb.

She was elected to federal parliament at the 1996 federal election and served as the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 2001 to 2006, under opposition leaders Simon Crean, Mark Latham and Kim Beazley. After the ALP won government at the 2007 election, she held ministerial office under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, serving as Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (2007‚Äì2013) and Minister for Disability Reform (2011‚Äì2013). She retired from parliament at the 2019 election. Early life Macklin was born in Brisbane on 29 December 1953. Her father was an engineer. She grew up in country Victoria, initially in Cohuna where she attended the local primary school. In 1966 the family moved to Wangaratta where she attended Wangaratta High School, also spending a year as an exchange student in Japan on a Rotary Scholarship. Macklin went on to the University of Melbourne, graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Commerce (Hons.). From 1976 to 1978, Macklin worked as a researcher at the Australian National University (ANU) under accounting and finance professor Russell Matthews. She then joined the Parliamentary Library as an economics specialist within the Legislative Research Service. Her work on energy pricing in the aluminium industry came to the attention of Victorian Labor MP Brian Howe, and in 1981 he recruited her to join the Labor Resource Centre in Melbourne as a research coordinator. She was a member of a Canberra discussion group, the Red Fems, which presented a paper to the Women and Labour Conference in 1980. From 1985 to 1988, Macklin served as an adviser to David White, the state health minister. In 1990, Macklin's mentor Brian Howe was appointed Minister for Health in the Hawke Government. She was subsequently appointed as the director of the government's National Health Strategy (NHS) initiative, tasked with reviewing Australia's existing health system. She delivered a series of background papers and issues papers, one of which proposed the abolition of private health insurance. The NHS body was disbanded in 1993 following a one- year extension of its initial two-year term. Macklin then served as director of the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review from 1993 to 1995. Politics Macklin early in her political career In 1994, Macklin won ALP preselection for the Division of Jagajaga, defeating former Casey MP Peter Steedman. =Opposition (1996‚Äì2007)= Macklin in August 2005 Macklin was elected to parliament at the 1996 federal election, which saw the defeat of the ALP government. She was immediately elected a member of the shadow ministry, where she served in a number of roles, including Shadow Minister for Aged Care, Social Security and the Status of Women. After the 1998 election, Macklin became Shadow Minister for Health. She is a member of the Socialist Left faction of the Labor Party. After the ALP's defeat at the 2001 election, Macklin was elected unopposed as deputy leader to Simon Crean. She was the first woman to hold a leadership position in either Australian major party. She took on the position of Shadow Minister for Education. Macklin remained Deputy Leader after Crean's replacement as leader by Mark Latham in December 2003, and also under Kim Beazley following Latham's resignation in January 2005. Macklin became the first person to be deputy to three leaders of the ALP since Frank Forde. On 1 December 2006, Macklin's position as deputy leader of the ALP came under threat after Kim Beazley called for a spill of all the leadership positions, in a bid to end growing speculation over the issue. Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Kevin Rudd, and Shadow Minister for Health, Julia Gillard, announced their intentions to run against Beazley and Macklin as a team for the positions of leader and deputy leader respectively of the party. On the day of the ballot, Macklin effectively stepped down from the position, choosing not to contest the deputy leadership after Kevin Rudd was elected as the new party leader. Macklin was once again elected to the Shadow frontbench, and was appointed Shadow Minister for Families and Community Services and Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Reconciliation. She maintained these portfolios in government after Labor's victory in the 2007 election. =Government (2007‚Äì2013)= Macklin with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Tom Calma at the apology for the stolen generations in 2008 In 2007, Macklin became the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. In this capacity she oversaw the passage and implementation of Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave Scheme, the Closing the Gap framework to address the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, a historic rise in the pensions and a number of other significant changes to social policy and family support payments. In 2011, Macklin was given the additional responsibility of Minister for Disability Reform, overseeing the design and implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Macklin was also a member of the Government's Expenditure Review Committee and Chair of the Government's Social Policy Committee. Indigenous Affairs Macklin was Minister for Indigenous Affairs throughout the Labor Government's two terms in office. Macklin was instrumental in the National Apology to the Stolen Generations, delivered by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in February 2008 and the implementation of the Close the Gap Framework, the first comprehensive strategy for tackling Indigenous disadvantage in Australia's history. This strategy saw record investment in health, education, housing, early childhood development and remote Indigenous service provision. She has said that one of her most important achievements was to take the politics out of Indigenous affairs and destroy the toxic division between \\"symbols\\" and \\"practical\\" change. On 23 November 2011, the Stronger Futures Policy legislation was introduced by Macklin to address key issues such as unemployment, school attendance, alcohol abuse, child protection, safety, housing and land reforms in the Northern Territory. National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) On 10 August 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister Macklin announced the Labor Government's support for a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) a major social policy reform designed to ensure that people with disability received the care and support they need. The rollout of the NDIS commenced in 2013 at four launch sites around Australia, with full rollout to be completed in 2019. Macklin was instrumental in the success of negotiations with states and territories, which resulted in a nationwide agreement on the NDIS. When fully completed in 2019 the NDIS is expected to cover around 460,000 Australians with disability. Paid Parental Leave Macklin was the Minister was responsible for the design and implementation of Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme. Prior to its launch on 1 January 2011, Australia was one of just two developed countries without a national paid parental leave scheme. The scheme provides primary care givers with 18 weeks' of paid parental leave paid at the national minimum wage. In the six years since the scheme was launched more than 700,000 Australian families have accessed paid parental leave. An independent review of the scheme in 2014 found that more than 75 per cent of parents accessing paid parental leave were on incomes of less than $70,000 a year. In the 2015 Budget the Abbott Government announced a measure to end so called 'double dipping' of paid parental leave by restricting 80,000 new parents from accessing both employer and government paid parental leave schemes. The use of the term provoked widespread condemnation from women's groups and some employers. Macklin led Labor's opposition to the Liberal Government's cuts to paid parental leave, which have failed to pass the Parliament. Dad and Partner Pay The introduction of Dad and Partner Pay (DAPP) on 1 January 2013, established two weeks paid leave to fathers and partners to help them take time off work to support new mothers in their caring role and be involved in the care of their newborn baby. This was another social policy reform that Macklin spearheaded during her time as Minister. An independent report conducted by the University of Queensland in 2014 found that DAPP reduced the barriers to fathers taking leave following a birth. Apology to Forgotten Australians Macklin was also the steward for the National Apology to the Forgotten Australians and former Child Migrants, in her capacity as Families Minister. Former Prime Minister Rudd gave the Apology on 16 November 2009 on behalf of the Australian Government to over half a million children who were taken from their families and placed in institutions where they were often victims of abuse. Macklin said the apology demonstrated 'the shared resolve to make sure the abuse and neglect never happens again'. =Opposition (2013‚Äì2019)= Macklin in 2013 Following the ALP's defeat at the 2013 federal election, Macklin endorsed Anthony Albanese for the leadership of the party. Albanese was defeated by Bill Shorten in the leadership vote. Macklin was included in Shorten's shadow ministry and retained her place until announcing her retirement, holding the portfolios of families and payments (2013‚Äì2016), disability reform (2013‚Äì2016) and families and social services (2016‚Äì2018). Macklin announced her retirement from politics on 6 July 2018, effective at the 2019 federal election. Later activities In June 2020, Macklin and former Victorian Labor Premier Steve Bracks were appointed as administrators of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party by the party's National Executive until early 2021, after allegations of branch-stacking by Victorian minister Adem Somyurek were revealed. The pair will review the state party‚Äôs operations and provide detailed recommendations to tackle the issue of branch- stacking within the party.

He styled himself, and has been referred to in the media, as \\"Serb Adolf\\". The War Jelisiƒá joined the Republika Srpska police force in February 1992 as an opportunity for early release from his check fraud prison sentence. In May, he was sent to a Brƒçko police station. Jelisiƒá commanded the Luka camp during the war. This camp was among the most notorious prison camps in Bosnia. It was located on the most important arterial road near Brƒçko in north Bosnia, which connected the two parts of Republika Srpska. During Jelisiƒá's trial, many witnesses came forward describing other acts by him during the war. An old Muslim friend of Jelisiƒá's noted that Jelisiƒá gave his wife money while he was in captivity to help her flee abroad. Another friend of Jelisiƒá's described how he helped the friend's sister and her husband escape in a similar way. Many others submitted similar sorts of testimony regarding Jelisiƒá's acts to safeguard and help Muslim and non-Muslim friends before and during the war. In his hometown of Bijeljina, Jelisiƒá paid hospital costs for Bosnian Muslims. Trial =Capture= On 22 January 1998, Jelisiƒá was apprehended in Serb-dominated Bijeljina by Task Force Razorback‚Äîa joint CIA‚ÄìDOD unit attached to Operation Amber Star. This was the culmination of a months-long intelligence operation (codenamed Operation Amber Light) led by Lt Col Rick Francona. The Navy SEAL team which executed the arrest was led by Ryan Zinke, who would later be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Jelisiƒá's apartment was surrounded by U.S. forces, and he was taken without incident. This capture was the first performed by U.S. forces against a Bosnian war criminal (though U.S. forces served as backup for Dutch and British forces in the previous year). After his capture, Jelisiƒá was transferred to a U.S. base at Tuzla, taken into custody by an FBI Special Agent and flown to The Hague. U.S. forces reported that the operation was planned in advance. The operation occurred during a week in which human rights groups were pressuring the Clinton administration to use U.S. troops to help detain some of the dozens of war criminals still at large. =Charges= Jelisiƒá faced trial for one count of genocide, sixteen counts of violating the customs of war and fifteen counts of crimes against humanity in relation to his involvement in the inhumane treatment and systematic killing of detainees at the Luka camp, where he was alleged to have, every day, \\"entered Luka's main hangar, where most detainees were kept, selected detainees for interrogation, beat them and then often shot and killed them\\". A specific instance of this type of allegation is that Jelisiƒá beat an elderly Muslim man to death with a metal pipe, a shovel, and a wooden stick. =Sentencing= In 1999, Jelisiƒá pleaded guilty to the charges of crimes against humanity and violating the customs of war. He was acquitted on the charge of genocide as the court did not believe the prosecution had proved this beyond reasonable doubt. He was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. The same sentence was confirmed by the appeals chamber.Goran Jelisiƒá acquitted of genocide and found guilty of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war Press release, The Hague, 19 October 1999 JL/P.I.S./441-E. The sentence was at that time the most severe given by the Hague, superseding the 20-year ruling against Du≈°ko Tadiƒá. The court also suggested Jelisiƒá receive psychiatric treatment. In 2001, the prosecution requested a retrial on Jelisiƒá's dismissed charge of genocide, but an appeals court upheld his 40-year sentence. On 29 May 2003, Jelisiƒá was transferred to Italy to serve the remainder of his sentence with credit for time served since his 1998 arrest. Jelisiƒá's trial was unusual due to the number of sympathetic witnesses, including Muslim friends. Friends, neighbors, and schoolmates, many of whom were Muslim, appeared to defend him. The trial's defense lawyer noted that the trial was peculiar given the number of people from the victimized group defending the Serbian war criminal. Jelisiƒá's trial is considered important for setting a high standard of evidence for charges of genocide. His was also significant for being one of only three people to admit to their crimes before the Hague tribunal (as of 2004). =Other trials= Jelisiƒá attended the war crimes trial of Esad Landjo, a Bosnian Muslim who committed war crimes against Serbians at the ƒåelebiƒái camp. He provided a passionate character witness in defense of the Bosnian Muslim, noting how Landjo had aided other prisoners in the prison at The Hague. Personal life Jelisiƒá was born in 1968 in Bijeljina, a town that was at the time 40% Muslim. Born to a working mother, he was raised primarily by his grandmother, and he had a variety of Serb and Muslim friends. Prior to the war, Jelisiƒá worked as a farmhand and enjoyed fishing. During his trial, members of his fishing groups appeared to defend him as character witnesses. After committing check fraud in Bosnia, he was imprisoned for severeral months. He was released in February 1992 with the opportunity to volunteer for Republica Srpska's war effort. On 21 December 2011, his wife, Monika Karan-Iliƒá (aka Monika Simeunoviƒá), was detained on suspicion of having committed war crimes against non-Serbs at the Luka camp. A native of Brƒçko, she had been in custody since 21 December 2011. She was found guilty of having participated in torture, inhumane treatment and infliction of suffering on Bosniak and Croat civilians in the Luka camp and Brƒçko police station between May and June 1992, when she was a teenager. Her sentence was reduced to two-and-a-half years of prison in 2013.

It recognizes a distinguished example of meritorious public service by a newspaper or news site through the use of its journalistic resources, which may include editorials, cartoons, photographs, graphics, video and other online material, and may be presented in print or online or both. The Public Service prize was one of the original Pulitzers, established in 1917, but no award was given that year.\\"1917 Winners\\". The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-12-26. It is the only prize in the program that awards a gold medal and is the most prestigious one for a newspaper to win. As with other Pulitzer Prizes, a committee of jurors narrows the field to three nominees, from which the Pulitzer Board generally picks a winner and finalists. Finalists have been made public since 1980. The Pulitzer Board issues an official citation explaining the reason for the award. Winners and citations In its first 97 years to 2013, the Public Service Pulitzer was awarded 96 times. There were four years for which no award was given, and two prizes were awarded in the years 1967, 1990, and 2006. In 1950, 1951, 1953, 1955 and 1959, prizes were awarded to two newspapers.

Holsworthy is most notable for a large Australian Army reserve, Holsworthy Barracks, where training exercises are frequently carried out. The reserve is adjacent to Heathcote Road, which connects to Bankstown, Liverpool, Lucas Heights, Engadine and Heathcote. Signs on the perimeter warn potential trespassers of the use of laser guided and conventional gunfire. The residential area is located north of the railway station. Anzac Village is a locality in the northern part of the suburb and the adjacent suburb of Wattle Grove. A new development called 'Mornington' has recently been built in this region. A shopping centre has also been built in this area. History The area was named after Holsworthy, Devon, England, where Governor Lachlan Macquarie married Elizabeth Campbell, on 3 November 1807. It was originally spelt as Holdsworthy until after World War II, when the 'd' was dropped.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 123 Originally the land belonged to the Tharawal people but following the arrival of the First Fleet, indigenous people were pushed back from their traditional lands in the area surrounding Sydney. In 1795, explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders explored the Georges River and in 1798, grants of land for farming were made in the area. The soil was good and crops of corn, wheat and vegetables were soon being harvested. However, tensions developed with the Tharawal. In 1801, Governor King ordered soldiers to fire on the aborigines to keep them from settler's properties. By 1815, Governor Macquarie declared a state of open warfare against aborigines in the Georges River area and forbade them carrying weapons within a mile of any British settlement. Ultimately, the British prevailed. A settlement named Eckersley was established in 1835 on what is now military land. By the 1880s a number of vineyards were established in the area. The land was acquired by the army in 1913. During World War I it was home to a large internment camp for civilians of German or Austro-Hungarian background, the camp absorbed prisoners from the infamous Torrens Island Concentration Camp in 1915. The modern village of Holsworthy evolved after World War II to the north, with the barracks to the south. The streets are named with a military theme, such as Tarakan, Bardia, Wewak, Lae, Brunei, Finschhafen, Madang, Gona, Anzac, Light Horse, Infantry, Cavalry, Sabre, Gunners Row and Trooper Row. In Anzac Village, Australian Generals are remembered with Birdwood, Monash, Bridges and Blamey. The Holsworthy bushland retains many indigenous sites and has been referred to as \\"Sydney's Kakadu\\". There are more than 500 significant Tharawal sites in the area including campsites, tool making sites and rock art. The art is mostly engravings of hands, boomerangs, animals, birds and fish. Climate Holsworthy has a temperate climate, with warm summers and cool to mild winters, with precipitation spread throughout the year. Thunderstorms are common in the summer months, and provide most of the precipitation in that season. Winters are pleasantly cool and sunny, although east coast lows can bring large amounts of rainfall. Snow has never occurred, although frost is a fairly common occurrence in winter. Being inland from the coast, and away from Sydney City, Holsworthy receives up to 500mm (20 in) less precipitation than coastal areas, just away. Population According to the 2016 census, Holsworthy had a population of 5,476. There were a high number of families with children (76.2%) and the median age of Holsworthy residents (30) was eight years younger than the national median. Not surprisingly, defence was the major industry of employment, covering 16.8% of the suburb's residents. The median family income ($2,179 per week) was substantially higher than the national median ($1,734). 60.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 7.3%, Philippines 3.0%, Indonesia 2.5%, New Zealand 2.2% and China 2.1%. 59.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Hindi 3.0%, Mandarin 2.9%, Indonesian 2.9%, Bengali 2.7% and Arabic 2.4%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 23.4%, No Religion 22.4%, Anglican 12.6% and Hinduism 10.8% Transport * Holsworthy railway station is on the Sydney Trains Airport & South Line. The railway station was opened in 1987 when the East Hills line was extended to Glenfield and Campbelltown. Pop culture *The Black Balloon, a film starring Toni Collette, Gemma Ward, Erik Thomson and Luke Ford, was filmed in Holsworthy.

Kneeboarding on a surf style board with fin(s) is also done in waves at the beach. In the usual configuration of a tow-sport kneeboard, riders kneel on their heels on the board, and secure themselves to the deck with an adjustable Velcro strap over their thighs. Most water ski kneeboards do not have fins to allow for easier surface spins. As in wakeboarding or water skiing, the rider hangs onto a tow- rope. The advantages of kneeboarding versus other tow-sports seems to be an easier learning curve and a sense of being closer to the water when falls occur. History Kneeboards were first produced commercially in the 1970s. While they were not widely popular at first, kneeboarding had become widespread by the mid-1970s. Today, kneeboarding remains popular, with sales of about 100,000 units per year. As waterskiing gained popularity, riders also experimented with kneeling down on round plywood discs. Others tried kneeling on surfboards and some used purpose-built kneeboards designed specifically for riding waves, but the water ski kneeboard did not emerge as a product until the 1970s. The first commercially available water ski kneeboard was Knee Ski, co-invented by Mike Murphy and Bud Hulst in 1972. Hulst had a background in surfing, manufacturing kneeboards for wave riding under the name of El Paipo. Murphy had been a professional show skier. The original Knee Ski was made from molded fiberglass, like a boat hull, and was neutrally buoyant. Each Knee Ski had a flat neoprene pad covering the entire deck, and a Velcro strap. In 1973, John Taylor, a former Knee Ski employee, decided to make and sell his own boards under the name of Glide Slide. Taylor took a new approach, blow molding a plastic shell and filling it with foam. Unfortunately the teardrop design was unstable, and Glide Slide faltered as the 1973 oil crisis slowed the water sports industry. Danny Churchill, quarter mile speed ski record holder in 1974 and former Glide Slide employee, bought the company in the wake of the oil crisis. Churchill redesigned the Glide Slide, in conjunction with fellow employee and engineer John Tanner, to make it more stable, and renamed the product Hydroslide in 1976. Churchill is most commonly known for popularizing the sport through advertising and promotions in the newly released full color water ski publications of the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the early 1980s the very first association for competition was formed called the International Kneeboard Association (IKA). Founded by Roland Hillier of Maitland, Florida, a former World Overall and Slalom Champion; National Slalom and Trick Champion; Masters Overall Water Ski Champion and three time Intercollegiate Overall Champion. Hillier created the rules and regulations for kneeboarding not only for boat towing method but also cableway towing. In boat towing the three competition events were tricks, slalom and wake crossing. A special event was also included to be called the \\"Flip-off\\" to see how many flips could be completed in twenty seconds. This proved to be quite popular with the spectators. In cableway competition, Roland designed the trick event which also included the use of small ramps for doing spins and flips. Calculations were needed to adjust for cableway towline length when the water levels changed. Roland Hillier also wrote and published the first book on kneeboarding called \\"Kneeboarding A - Z\\". After several National Championships, he produced and broadcast on ABC and, later, PBS of \\"The International Kneeboard Championships\\". This broadcast was the very first of its kind. The next year, Sea World of Orlando approached the IKA to hold a National Championship at their park, however, the original sponsors to the IKA would not be allowed to participate and Hillier felt strongly that supporters should be included and did not accept. The American Kneeboarding Association (AKA) was founded by another group of people after the International Kneeboard Association rejected the Sea World offer, and created their own form of competition. Eventually the AKA merged with USA WaterSki as one of its designated towable sports. ¬π Kneeboarding History One of the earliest types of kneeboarding is 'tourist kneeboarding'. In this type of kneeboarding, the rider begins on land, already strapped to the board. This type of kneeboarding is far easier than normal kneeboarding, usually done in a river or on a lake. Regular kneeboarding is far superior to \\"tourist kneeboarding\\" because you are already in the water and can take off faster. Description Required equipment includes a tow rope, a kneeboard and a boat that can go about 15-20 mph (28‚Äì32 km/h). Also, most importantly, a certified life vest for safety. Kneeboarding starts are relatively simple, and the rider does not need to travel very quickly. There are two basic grips ‚Äì the palms-down grip and the baseball bat grip. For the palms-down grip the hands facing downward while holding the ski rope. For the Baseball Bat grip kneeboarders hold the handle just like a baseball bat. Tricks Here is a list of kneeboarding tricks: # Riding - Ride with your arms at full extension (this keeps your arms from tiring,) your knees in the divits, and the strap on relatively tight. # Turning - While riding, hold on tightly to the tow rope, and lean your body to one side. This should put the kneeboard on its edge, and take you outside of the boat's wake. To come back straight behind the boat, lean in the other direction. To turn more aggressively, pull in on the rope with your arms (the handle should be close to the hip, the opposite side from the side your turning to) and lean harder. # Side Slide/Butter Slide - Position yourself directly behind the boat with a palms-down grip. Rotate the board sideways without turning on edge - the board should slide. As you slide sideways, lean back so the boat doesn't pull you forward. It makes it much easier if you pull the handle and place it on your hip while you turn sideways. You should lean away from the boat just a little. # \\"Jumping the wake\\"- To jump the wake while on a kneeboard, simply cut hard out of the wake, get as far away from the boat as possible (to one side,) then use a progressively harder cut back toward the wake. Lean back slightly, and you will launch off the wake of the boat, sending you into the air. Make sure you hold the board flat by using your stomach muscles. # The ole - To perform this trick, you must combine the skills of balance and riding one-handed. You pull in the tow rope, pulling in hand-over-hand, until you are holding the rope roughly beyond the handle. From there, you hold the rope in one hand, near your hip, and then swing the remainder of the rope, along with the handle, above your head # Surface 360 - This trick is very similar to the side slide. Slightly rotate to one side to build momentum, and then fully rotate in the opposite direction. If you are spinning to the right, release the rope with your right hand, spin, grab the rope again behind your back, and then pull yourself through to finish the 360. # Riding Backwards - You go through exactly the same motion as a 360, but instead of pulling yourself through the 360, you pause while both hands are behind your back. You must lean forward while riding backwards - leaning what is forward to the rider will push the nose down and the tail up. Otherwise, the tail could go under the water and flip the rider. # Wake Front-to-Back - Make a hard cut from outside the wake, using the palms-down grip. Right before you hit the wake, stop cutting and pop up in a jump, focusing on pushing your knees away from your chest to give you added height. As soon as you are airborne, rotate your body to the right and pull the handle to your hip. As you spin, keep a tight grip on the rope, and lean forward slightly. Keep leaning forward (away from the boat) as you hit the water. Once you have landed, you should be riding backwards, and can continue to ride with both hands at your hip. # Wake 360 front-to-front (wrapped) - While in the middle of the wake, pull yourself towards the boat, collecting the rope in one hand. Then, wrap the rope around your back, and hold onto the handle. Let go of the rope, and the friction of the rope straightening will spin you around. # Air (Ollie) - similar to the skateboarding trick of the same name, or a bunny hop in BMX, it is possible to jump without utilizing the wake. By pushing down against the water with your knees and simultaneously pulling the handle in provides more tension on the rope. Then pulling upwards with your legs, you can make the entire board leave the water. If this is combined with 'jumping' the wake, much greater heights can be achieved. # Back Roll - Make a hard cut toward the wake. One millisecond before you hit the wake, flatten out. Ride up the wake while resisting it (see wake jump). At the top of the wake, and not before, throw your shoulders sideways in the direction of your roll. At the same time, look back over your shoulder and pull the handle to your waist. Your momentum will take you around and then you just need to land. If you are coming up short, you are most likely throwing the trick too soon, letting your arms out, or not throwing the trick sideways. If you lean forward at all, you will lose your rotation momentum. # Switch 3 - The switch 3 is basically a wake 360 back except that you change the direction of rotation after 180 degrees. Make a hard cut toward the wake with a palms down grip. When you reach the trough, spin around 180 degrees. Rotate to the left if you're cutting to the right and rotate to the right if you're cutting to the left. Tuck the handle into your hip. Ride up the wake while resisting it to get a good pop. Once you are in the air and not sooner, spin back to the front. As you come around, keep the handle low and let your arms extend out. Once you reach the forward position, pull the handle to your waist again and spin backward in the opposite direction. Land backwards and use your second pop to spin back to the front. It's very important to keep the handle at your waist and your head up when landing. # Frontflip - Edge in hard, flatten out, pop off the wake and immediately throw your body straight down, keeping both hands on the handle and close to your hip. This will help with rotation and control.

She served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Donegal South-West constituency from 1987 to 2011. Early life Coughlan was born in Donegal town in the south of County Donegal in 1965. Her father was Cathal Coughlan, a Fianna F√°il TD, who died in office in June 1986. She was educated at the Ursuline Convent in Sligo, where she was a boarder from 1978 to 1983 and later at University College Dublin, graduating with a Social Science degree. She worked as a social worker for a brief period before becoming involved in politics. Political career =Early political life= Coming from a political family, Coughlan was always interested in politics, and joined a local party branch at the age of 16. She was first elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1987 general election as a Fianna F√°il TD for the Donegal South-West constituency. At the age of 21 years and nine months, Coughlan was the youngest member of the 25th D√°il. Her uncle Clement Coughlan was a TD from 1980 until his death in 1983 in a road traffic accident, while her father Cathal Coughlan was a TD from 1983 to 1986 when he died after a short illness. The death of her father resulted in Coughlan being co-opted onto Donegal County Council in 1986, which launched her own political career. She remained on the backbenches of the D√°il for the first thirteen years of her career as a TD, before being appointed a junior Minister. During this period she served on a number of Oireachtas committees, including the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Joint Committee on the Irish language where she served as Chairperson. Coughlan was also a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body. In 1994, Bertie Ahern became leader of Fianna F√°il and Leader of the Opposition. In early 1995 he named his new front bench, including Coughlan as Spokesperson on Educational Reform. She served in this position until 1997 but was not included in the cabinet or junior ministerial team when the party came to power. =Minister of State= In February 2001, Coughlan received her first ministerial position, that of Minister of State (Junior Minister) at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and Islands). In this role for just sixteen months, she was responsible for securing Government approval for the general scheme of the Official Languages Equality Bill, which aimed to confirm the language rights of citizens and outline their rights when dealing with the State in either official language. She also oversaw the coming-into- force of an amended Gaeltacht Housing Act, updating the supports available for Irish-speaking households building in or moving to the Gaeltacht. The Commission on Irish in the Gaeltacht (Comisi√∫n na Gaeltachta) also completed its work under her guidance and Coughlan saw its report approved and published. During her time in this role, she also established a Working Group on the Creation of Employment in the Gaeltacht. In addition, during her tenure Coughlan oversaw significant investment in island infrastructure and in the connection of islands to the national electricity grid, including Inishbofin Island, off the County Donegal coast, which was connected for the first time in 2002 by using an underwater cable from the mainland. =Cabinet career (2002‚Äì11)= Minister for Social and Family Affairs (2002‚Äì04) After the 2002 general election Coughlan was promoted to the cabinet as Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Her time in Social and Family Affairs saw increases in social welfare payments and the extension of family supports. She established the Family Support Agency with a mandate to support families, promote stability in family life, prevent marital breakdown and foster a supportive community environment for families at a local level. Coughlan received criticism for changes she made regarding the availability of rent supplement. This was portrayed as targeting the weaker sections of society at a time when the Irish economy was reasonably strong. She was also widely criticised for cuts she made as Minister to entitlements for widows and widowers after the death of a spouse. The cuts were part of a wider drive for a reduction in government spending in autumn 2002. However, many considered these and other similar cutbacks to have been forced upon her by Charlie McCreevy, who was Minister for Finance at the time, and who was blamed for many of his decisions. She was also involved in resolving a dispute over payments with the country‚Äôs dentists. During her time as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, she was praised for introducing large increases in Child Benefit and in pensions. Her work on the pensions element of her portfolio also saw her introduce Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. Coughlan also established the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and provided additional funding and support for the State's Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (2004‚Äì08) In a 2004 cabinet reshuffle, Coughlan succeeded Joe Walsh as Minister for Agriculture and Food, becoming the first woman to hold that portfolio in Ireland. During her time in this role the country's last two remaining sugar factories, owned by Greencore, were closed. The Carlow factory closed on 11 March 2005. Mallow, Ireland‚Äôs last sugar factory to remain open, closed on 12 May 2006, after operating for 77 years. Farmers and others were critical of the decision. They criticised the government's and the Minister's roles, both were seen as not doing enough to try to stop the closures, though they had retained some control over the factories since they had been privatised a number of years before. As sugar beet growers now had nowhere to sell their sugar beet, cultivation of the crop ceased in Ireland. Coughlan also headed this Department at a time when the spread of bird flu from abroad looked very likely to occur, especially in 2006. Coughlan was re-appointed to the portfolio on 14 June 2007 following the 2007 general election, with the additional responsibility of fisheries as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Shortly after her re-appointment Coughlan had to put in place measures to deal with the threat of the potential spread of foot-and-mouth disease from Britain in early August 2007. Throughout her time in this ministry, Coughlan was involved in ongoing WTO trade talks. T√°naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (2008‚Äì10) Following Bertie Ahern's resignation on 6 May 2008, Coughlan, in a cabinet re-shuffle, became T√°naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 7 May 2008, by newly appointed Taoiseach Brian Cowen. As a proponent of the Treaty of Lisbon, Coughlan was noted to have \\"quietly withdrawn\\" from the first referendum campaign after she embarrassed the Government in a radio interview by not knowing the number of European Commissioners. Over a period of four days Coughlan stated that the EU's larger nations still had two Commissioners each. In fact, the bigger states had lost their second places on the Commission in 2004. According to an editorial in The Irish Times, \\"how someone who had spent several years around an EU Council of Ministers' table could not know that is extraordinary\\". Responding to a row over medical cards she displayed insufficient mathematical skill, saying \\"Of the savings of ‚Ç¨100 million, ‚Ç¨86 million is for GPs and ‚Ç¨30 million is for pharmacists\\". Her performance as T√°naiste in defence of the October 2008 budget was criticised by opposition politicians and the media, with Fine Gael's Leo Varadkar publicly comparing Coughlan to gaffe-prone Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin. Varadkar's comments were challenged by broadcaster John Bowman and Sunday Tribune journalist Justine McCarthy, as well as by Coughlan herself. Coughlan announced a third change in the budgetary position, in her local constituency, prior to Cabinet agreement and five days before the responsible Minister for Social and Family Affairs announced it to the nation, via RT√â Radio. Coughlan acted to clean up years of wasteful spending by executives at the state training and employment agency, F√ÅS, and was considered to have taken a tough line with Director General, Rody Molloy, who was forced to resign in November 2008.Later, it was discovered that Mr Molloy had received a payoff of ‚Ç¨1 million and the retention of his company car, destroying the earlier view of a tough line being taken by Coughlan, who approved the payment without reference to either the Cabinet or official guidelines. The 2008 fall in the value of sterling against the euro saw the price gap between North and South widen and shoppers cross to Northern Ireland to the detriment of businesses in the South. Coughlan asked multiple retailers to reduce their margins south of the border and provide better value to consumers in the South. Research from Forf√°s, concluded that only a five per cent difference in the cost of goods between North and South was justifiable. The findings highlighted retailers' larger margins in the South in relation to their operations in the North and Coughlan queried why the price differential in many identical goods was substantially in excess of 5%. Coughlan said: \\"I don't own a shop. The Government doesn't own a shop. It's up to Tesco, it's up to Superquinn, it's up to Aldi, it's up to Lidl; it's up to them to cut their prices. They need to ensure that that happens; they have to do something about it.\\" When retailers continued to remain silent on the price differential, Coughlan sent in the Competition Authority to investigate supply chains in the retail sector. Coughlan was condemned for doing \\"too little too late\\" in relation to large-scale loss of employment at a Dell facility in Limerick, despite successfully retaining 2,000 Dell employees in Ireland. She also successfully secured over ‚Ç¨22 million of European Globalisation Adjustment Fund money to the benefit of the workers made redundant in Limerick. Coughlan was accused by an opposition spokesperson of being unable to debate exchequer figures. Coughlan acted to close loopholes in company law that made it possible for bank directors not to have to disclose the full extent of their indebtedness to the bank in its published accounts. She also strengthened the powers of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to enforce company law provisions. On 24 April 2009, one of Coughlan's demoted junior ministers, John McGuinness, criticised Coughlan and Cowen for the lack of leadership being given to the country, saying: \\"She's not equipped to deal with the complex issues of dealing with enterprise and business within the department. And neither is the department\\". McGuinness' credibility was subsequently undermined when it was revealed that he had hired external PR advice in an effort to undermine Coughlan and enhance his own profile as a Minister of State within her Department. In April 2009, she denied there would be a supplementary budget ‚Äì one was announced five days later ‚Äì also claiming that the public finances were under control at the same time. In September that year Coughlan was described as Calamity Coughlan,\\"Calamity Coughlan Blunder: After mixing up Darwin and Einstein, how long can we carry on with our laughing stock Tanaiste?\\". having been left red-faced after erroneously referring to the theory of evolution as having been formulated by Einstein. Later that month she apparently let slip the date of a general election while speaking about the budget when Brian Cowen was in New York. She also memorably called her Green Party colleagues \\"na glasra√≠\\" ‚Äì Irish language for \\"the vegetables\\". Minister for Education and Skills (2010‚Äì11) On 23 March 2010, following a cabinet reshuffle, she was moved to the newly named Department of Education and Skills, while retaining the position of T√°naiste. One of Coughlan's first initiatives in the portfolio was to voice her support for the introduction of a CAO points bonus for students studying higher level maths. She revamped the Student Maintenance Grant application procedure, streamlining administration and getting the scheme out two months earlier than in previous years. Minister for Health and Children (2011) Following the resignation of Mary Harney in January 2011, Coughlan was also appointed as Minister for Health and Children. =Loss of seat= At the 2011 general election, Coughlan lost her seat to Independent candidate Thomas Pringle. Her first preference vote more than halved from 26.5% in 2007 to just over 11%. Her running mate Brian √ì Domhnaill also failed to be elected, leaving Donegal South-West without a Fianna F√°il TD for the first time in its history. The loss of her seat was considered the most high-profile casualty of the Fianna F√°il meltdown. The Guardian newspaper described it as \\"Ireland's Portillo moment\\". Coughlan received a lump sum of ‚Ç¨237,000, and an annual pension of ‚Ç¨140,000. Views on LGBT rights During her time as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Coughlan became involved in a number of LGBT rights controversies. In March 2004, she introduced the Social Welfare Amendment Act 2004 in response to a case involving same-sex partner benefits. Under the Equal Status Act, 2000, a gay pensioner successfully petitioned the Equality Authority to allow his male partner to travel as his 'spouse' using the pensioner's travel pass. The legislation which Coughlan subsequently produced limited the meaning of the word 'spouse' to include only married couples; this was regarded by the Opposition parties and LGBT rights campaigners as discriminatory towards same-sex couples as there had been no legal recognition of same-sex unions in the Republic of Ireland at the time. Two months later, Coughlan caused comment at a European Union conference on family and social policy by stating that Ireland would never be ready for same-sex marriage or gay adoption. During her time in Social and Family Affairs, Coughlan produced a report discussing new definitions of 'the family' which recommended a more progressive approach to the matter. This influenced the Government's 2008 civil union legislation. Personal life Mary Coughlan was married to David Charlton, a Garda who lost a leg in a serious car accident a few years after they were married, from 1991 until his death from cancer on 2 September 2012. They were married when Coughlan was aged 26, two years after they met, David was working as a Garda on duty at Leinster House at the time. They have two children, one son and one daughter. They lived at Frosses, a village just west of Donegal town. Coughlan is a fluent Irish speaker.

He was an independent member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1996 until October 2007, representing the electorate of Calare, New South Wales. Biography Peter Andren was born in Gulargambone, New South Wales, and attended Normanhurst Boys' High School and Macquarie University, Sydney. He was a teacher, television reporter, presenter and producer and radio and television news editor with Prime Television and 2GZ before entering politics. The Andren Report, by Peter Andren In the 1996 election, he stood for election in Calare. He was not only displeased with the quality of candidates in the field to succeed longtime Labor incumbent David Simmons, but felt that rural Australia was losing its voice in Canberra. It was initially thought that Simmons' retirement gave the Nationals a chance to take the seat. However, owing partly to his name recognition (Prime's service area covered most of the electorate), Andren won the seat after Labor's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him, taking 63 percent of the two- candidate vote.http://psephos.adam- carr.net/countries/a/australia/1996/1996repsnsw.txt He held the seat without serious difficulty in the next three elections; his two candidate-preferred vote of over 75 per cent in 2001 made Calare the second-safest seat in Australia.Peter Andren, The Andren Report: An independent way in Australian politics , Scribe Publications, 2003 He attempted to implement changes to politicians' superannuation, involving giving members the opportunity to opt out of the parliamentary scheme. He introduced a Private Member's Bill to this extent, which failed to pass through either house. He had been an active opponent of genetically modified crops, and was involved with the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. Andren was known to join with the other two rural independent members, Bob Katter and Tony Windsor, in raising regional issues with the Parliament and media. He was also a vocal critic of Australia's policy on asylum seekers, and the Iraq War. A redistribution of electoral boundaries in 2006 effectively cut Calare in half and reduced Andren's notional majority, leading to speculation that he might have stood for the neighbouring seat of Macquarie, which now included former Calare cities Bathurst and Lithgow, at the next election. On 29 March 2007, he instead made an announcement that he would stand down from Calare to contest a New South Wales seat in the Senate‚Äîa race that it was widely believed he would win. However he subsequently announced on 10 August 2007 that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and that \\"the diagnosis and available interventions to treat this cancer are not very encouraging.\\" Due to his illness, he had to abandon his candidacy for a seat in the Senate and he saw out his term as member for Calare until the parliament was dissolved on 17 October, before the 2007 election. He died less than three weeks later, on 3 November, survived by his partner Valerie Faber, his two sons Greg and Josh and his ex-wife Jenny Price. His funeral at Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Orange was attended by an estimated 600‚Äì1000 people. Andren's seat of Calare was won by John Cobb for the National Party at the 2007 election. On 9 June 2008 Andren's appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia was posthumously announced. The award cited his services in Parliament and to rural and regional Australia. After his death, the Orange Aboriginal Medical Service set up a $5,000 medical scholarship named in Andren's honour.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Waterford constituency from 1987 to 1989 and from 1992 to 2010. He was a Senator from 1989 to 1992, after being nominated by the Taoiseach. Background, early and private life Martin Cullen was born in Waterford in 1954. He was educated at Waterpark College and the Regional Technical College, Waterford. He is married and has four children ‚Äì three sons and one daughter. However, in late 2004 he stated that he was separated from his wife, Dorthe. Cullen's father and grandfather had been Mayor of Waterford, a position Martin Cullen himself later occupied in 1993‚Äì94. Cullen worked as a sales manager for a wine company before becoming interested in politics. He was also Chief Executive of the Irish Transport Operators. Political career Cullen was one of 14 Progressive Democrats TDs elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1987 general election, the first election after the party was founded. During his first period as a TD he served as his party's spokesperson on Tourism, Transport and Communications (1987‚Äì1988) and Industry and Commerce (1988‚Äì1989). Cullen lost his seat at the 1989 general election but was subsequently nominated by the Taoiseach to Seanad √âireann. During the intervening period he was elected to Waterford City Council, before returning to the D√°il at the 1992 general election. The following year he was appointed party spokesperson on Enterprise and Employment. In 1994 Cullen became disillusioned with the Progressive Democrat Party. He subsequently resigned from the party, eventually joining Fianna F√°il. =Ahern Government= In 1997 a Fianna F√°il‚ÄìProgressive Democrats coalition government came to power and Cullen was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Finance. He was also given responsibility for the Office of Public Works where he made huge progress in restoring the reputation of that Department with number of high- profile projects, such as Leinster House 2000 and the purchase of the Farmleigh estate from Edward Guinness. After the Government's re-election in 2002, Cullen joined the Cabinet as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. As Minister responsible for elections, he inherited a previous government decision to move to an electronic-based system which was successfully tested by the previous government. However a media-led campaign which became highly politicized, derailed public confidence in the new system coupled with a desire to retain the old paper system. The electronic system was ultimately scrapped by government years later. He took a strong interest in Environmental Policies and introduced the highly successful \\"Race Against Waste Campaign\\" which had a huge impact on how domestic waste was separated and collected. Ireland assumed the European Presidency during his tenure and he became President of the European Environmental Council and played a significant role at the world Earth Summits. In a cabinet reshuffle in 2004 Cullen was appointed Minister for Transport. During that appointment he became embroiled in even more controversy. Two independent reports have cleared him of any wrongdoing in the awarding of lucrative Public Relations contracts to Monica Leech, who subsequently became President of Waterford Chambers of Commerce. With the support of a majority of D√°il √âireann, he was the minister responsible for the stock market flotation of Aer Lingus, Ireland's national airline. According to the government this was done as the EU would not easily permit direct government investment in the airline. The sale included Aer Lingus' access slots to various airports including London Heathrow Airport. Some critics at the time suggested that it was important that Ireland, as an island nation, retain control of an airline in order to ensure connectivity to nearby countries. In May 2005, Minister Cullen told D√°il √âireann that \\"in the context of any decision to reduce State ownership in Aer Lingus, all the options available within the regulatory framework will be examined to ensure adequate ongoing access to Heathrow for Irish consumers\\". Others, including members of Seanad √âireann and D√°il √âireann raised the issue of the Heathrow slots. Shortly after the privatisation, Irish-based private airline Ryanair attempted a takeover of Aer Lingus which was eventually blocked by other shareholders including the government (who retained a 28.3% share), Aer Lingus employee groups and Irish businessman Denis O'Brien. Cullen maintained throughout that the sale of Aer Lingus was \\"the right decision\\". In August 2007, Aer Lingus announced that it would cease flying from Shannon Airport to London Heathrow Airport, instead using its Heathrow slots to fly from Belfast International Airport in Northern Ireland. This decision caused considerable controversy in the Republic of Ireland. principally due to the loss of connectivity from businesses in the West of Ireland to a major international hub. Local representatives in the Shannon area have claimed that Minister Cullen ignored calls to ring-fence slots for Shannon airport. The airport access slots are held by Aer Lingus for historical reasons, as the national carrier for the Republic of Ireland. This was the first time since the privatisation of Aer Lingus that traditional Irish slots were transferred outside the state. Aer Lingus has admitted that they have further slots to lease at Heathrow. It has also been revealed that they intended removing flights from Cork Airport. =30th Da√≠l= Following the 2007 general election, he was appointed as Minister for Social and Family Affairs. On 7 May 2008, when Brian Cowen became Taoiseach, Cullen was appointed as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. He commented a week later, \\"My private life has all been about the arts. There's probably not an opera theatre in the world that I haven't been in, all in my own private time, I hasten to add\\".\\"Quotes of the week\\", Sunday Independent. 18 May 2008, p. 32. In December 2008 he courted controversy by commenting on national radio that he would be supportive of having an Irish football club taking part in England's Premier League, despite the damage such a development would have on domestic football in Ireland, and the comments were also seen as unsuitable for the Minister for Arts, Sports, and Tourism. His comments that he would like to \\"see a European [football] team playing out of Dublin‚Äù suggested he was not aware of, or interested in, the six Dublin-based teams currently playing in domestic football. In March 2009, a helicopter which was carrying him from Killarney to Dublin made an emergency landing shortly after take-off, because a door had fallen off. The minister was uninjured, but was reported to be \\"shaken\\". It was reported that the flight had cost nearly ‚Ç¨6,000. Cullen dismissed criticism at his use of the Air Corps helicopter, and said there had been no unnecessary spending on his travel. On 21 January 2010, he published his speech to the forum on Defamation Law, in which he spoke of his experiences of false allegations of adultery in the press. He felt \\"like waking up every morning and being raped\\", that he had been photographed on the front pages of Sunday newspapers for 13 consecutive weeks and that his sons had \\"had the living daylights\\" beaten out of them for defending their father's honour and had to be removed from school due to \\"horrendous bullying\\". Cullen described how he had been pursued by the media, with reporters harassing him, photographers following him, even once a photograph of him, the Taoiseach and his secretary, and a third man at a state function was altered to make it appear he was dining alone with the woman. \\"The impacts on one‚Äôs life are completely horrendous. I would go so far as to say in my case they are life-changing,\\" he said.'Your family gets followed. Your mother and father get followed' The Irish Times, 23 January 2010. Accessed 11 March 2010 He later defended his use of the word \\"rape\\". Cullen announced his resignation from his ministerial office and as a TD on 8 March 2010, due to a back ailment that had been troubling him severely in the preceding months. He stepped down on 23 March 2010 when Brian Cowen announced a cabinet reshuffle.

He served in the House of Representatives from 1983 to 2004, representing the Division of Wakefield for the Liberal Party. He was Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2004. Early life Andrew was born in Waikerie, South Australia, and was a horticulturalist before entering politics. He was a councillor in the District Council of Waikerie from 1976 to 1983. Politics Andrew was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1983 federal election. Having been for 15 years a little-known Liberal backbencher, he became Speaker of the House after the October 1998 elections. He presided over the House during the special sitting in May 2001 to mark the centenary of the Parliament of Australia, which met in the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, as did the first Parliament in 1901. In 2003, he \\"named\\" Greens Senators Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle after they interjected during George W. Bush's speech to Parliament. Along with Leo McLeay and Bronwyn Bishop, Andrew was one of only three Speakers (as of 2014) to be subjected to a motion of no confidence. In all cases these motions were unsuccessful as they were votes determined on party lines. Andrew previously represented a large swath of rural territory north of Adelaide. However, a redistribution ahead of the 2004 elections pushed his seat well to the south to take in heavily pro-Labor northern Adelaide suburbs that had previously been in the safe Labor seat of Bonython. Meanwhile, most of his former rural territory was redistributed to neighbouring Grey and Barker. Andrew held his old seat with a comfortably safe majority of 14 percent, but the reconfigured Wakefield had a Labor majority of just over one percent. Prior to the new boundaries being announced, Andrew notified Prime Minister John Howard that he would not renominate for Wakefield in the upcoming election. He remained Speaker until David Hawker was elected to succeed him on 16 November. Honours Andrew was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 2008 Australia Day Honours list \\"for service to the Parliament of Australia through the advancement of parliamentary administration and reform, and to the community in the areas of agricultural research, development and education\\" particularly as Chair of the Crawford Fund in Australia.

It is located at a latitude of 33¬∞ 35' 54\\" South and a longitude of 150¬∞45' 04\\" east, 19 metres above sea level on the alluvial Hawkesbury River flats, at the foot of the Blue Mountains. It is about 65 km by road from Sydney. History The Darug people were the Aboriginal peoples to the area in 1788. The area was originally explored by British settlers in 1789 and the nearby eminence to the west of the Hawkesbury River was known by them as 'Richmond Hill'. The name was given by Governor Phillip, in honour of Charles Lennox, the third Duke of Richmond who was Master General of Ordnance in the Pitt administration. The local area was the third area to have European settlement in Australia after Sydney and Parramatta. The first 22 European settlers came to the area in 1794. They came to farm a total of in what is now Pitt Town Bottoms. They needed good farming land to help overcome the desperate need for food in the new colony. By 1799 this region was producing about half the grain produced in the colony. The Battle of Richmond Hill took place in May and June 1795 between the Darug people and the European settlers. It is perhaps the first time that the colonial authorities sent in the troopers and expressly stated their intent to 'destroy' the whole local Aboriginal population of an area. Around 1811 Macquarie established the five Macquarie Towns in the area: Windsor, Richmond, Castlereagh, Wilberforce and Pitt Town. One of the early settlers, James Blackman,Wikicities entry on James Blackman (1754-1842) built Bowman Cottage from brick nog, a common construction technique in the colony, using money borrowed from William Cox. The house was constructed between the years 1815 and 1818. James was unable to pay his debts and was forced to sell the property to George Bowman. The building was restored by the NSW Public Works Department and then became a Division of the Australian Foundation for the Disabled, providing employment for the disabled.Bowman Cottage Page:Retrieved 22 March 2009 During WWII the RAAF operated a top secret operations bunker from somewhere in Richmond. It was either half or completely underground. The location of this bunker is unknown but it has been reported that this bunker was identical to the Bankstown Bunker which is currently buried under a public park in Bankstown. It has also been reported that this bunker could still be intact. RAAF Base Richmond is a Royal Australian Air Force base at Richmond which was established in 1923. The air base is currently the home to the RAAF's transport squadrons. During the Vietnam War, logistic support and medical evacuations were supplied by the C-130 Hercules aircraft from RAAF Richmond.

He was a National Party of Australia member of the Australian House of Representatives representing the Division of Richmond, New South Wales, from the March 1996 election until his defeat in the 2004 election. He held the seat that was previously held by his father, Doug Anthony, and his grandfather, Larry Anthony, senior. The Anthonys are the only three-generation dynasty in the history of the House of Representatives.Anthony, Dynasties (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), 14 December 2004. Early life Anthony was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and educated at Canberra Grammar School before attending university at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. He was a businessman and stockbroker before entering politics. Politics Anthony first ran in Richmond in 1993, losing to Labor incumbent Neville Newell‚Äîthe first time that a member of the Anthony family had lost an election. He sought a rematch in 1996, and defeated Newell as part of the Coalition's decisive win that year. However, due to demographic changes over the previous two decades that made Richmond much more compact and urban, Anthony was never able to establish nearly as secure a hold on the seat as his father and grandfather possessed when they held it for 47 consecutive years from 1937 to 1984. He barely held onto his seat in 1998 (against Newell) and 2001, surviving both times on One Nation preferences. In 2004, he was defeated by Labor's Justine Elliot, being the only Coalition MP from a rural electorate to lose his seat and the first member of the Anthony family to be unseated at an election. On the seventh count, Elliot picked up a large flow of Green preferences, allowing her to defeat Anthony by 301 votes. Anthony was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade 1998‚Äì99, Minister for Community Services 1999‚Äì2001 and Minister for Children and Youth Affairs from 2001 to 2004.

It is 38 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district in the Sutherland Shire. It is the southernmost suburb of Sydney in the eastern corridor, bordering the Illawarra region. Geography Waterfall is bordered to the north by the suburb of Heathcote, with Engadine further north; by The Royal National Park to the east; and by Heathcote National Park to the west. Helensburgh is the next town, travelling south. Waterfall marks the southern border of the Sutherland Shire. It is approximately 200 metres above sea level. Waterfall has only seven streets. The bushland gives the small suburb a natural surrounding and walking tracks lead from it into the neighbouring national parks. To the west is a dammed lake and behind it is Mount Westmacott.  History  Waterfall was a town created by rail workers, who built the line from Sydney to Wollongong in the late 19th century. It is the highest point on the line, with a steep rising gradient at one end, and a falling gradient at the other end, and sidings were provided in both directions to allow freight wagons to be stowed and shunted. Waterfall derived its name from the waterfalls close to the railway station. McKell Avenue, the southern border of the Royal National Park, was originally called Waterfall Road.History of Sutherland Shire Placenames The Waterfall State Sanitorium was established in 1909 for the treatment of tuberculosis patients. In 1973 Australia's first Community Advanced Driver Training Centre was opened in Waterfall but closed a few years later. The Waterfall train collision on 20 December 1994 involved two S-set electric trains which collided in the early hours of the morning during a shunting procedure at Waterfall station in the south of Sydney. Both trains were empty of passengers. Carriages jack-knifed in spectacular fashion onto the platform, causing demolition of a concrete ramp and part of the station canopy. The Waterfall train disaster on 31 January 2003 involved an interurban train service operated by unit G7, which crashed just past Waterfall. The cause of G7's crash was determined to be the heart attack of the driver and a failure of the safety equipment and the guard to stop the train.  Heritage listings  Waterfall has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Woronora Dam Road: Woronora Dam Population In the 2016 Census, there were 494 people in Waterfall. 85.4% of people were born in Australia and 91.3% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.6% and Anglican 28.2%.  Transport  Waterfall is the last suburb heading south on the Princes Highway before it leads into the Princes Motorway (formerly known as the F6 freeway) to the city of Wollongong. Waterfall railway station is the terminus for the Sydney Trains suburban Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line. However, some trains do terminate one stop further on at Helensburgh. Waterfall is also a stop on the NSW TrainLink South Coast Line, with platform 1 to Sydney terminal, platform 2 to Port Kembla, Dapto and Kiama.

He starred in some of the most popular Polish film productions of the 1930s, including His Excellency, The Shop Assistant (Polish: Jego ekscelencja subiekt), Czy Lucyna to dziewczyna? and Pie≈õniarz Warszawy. A skilled singer, he became one of the icons of Polish musical comedies of the time and a \\"symbol of Polish commercial cinema\\".Haltof (2002), p.45 Towards the end of that decade he also became a successful entrepreneur, a co-owner of a successful film studio, a caf√© and a producers company. Arrested by the Soviets in the aftermath of the German and Soviet invasion of Poland, he perished in the Gulag.  Biography  Bohdan Eug√®ne Junod was born on 28 December 1899. His birthplace however is not certain, sources mention Warsaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Geneva, Switzerland.Poskuta-W≈Çodek (2007) His mother was Jadwiga Anna Dorota n√©e Dylewska. His father, Teodor Junod, was a Swiss citizen who moved to Russian-held Poland and in 1903 settled in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. There he opened a revue- cinema Urania ‚Äì the first permanent cinema theatre in that city. It was there that Bodo made his stage debut at the age of six. In 1917 Junod moved to Pozna≈Ñ where he joined \\"Teatr Apollo\\". In 1919 (under a new stage name of Eugeniusz Bodo, the surname created from the initials of his own first name Bohdan and his mother's ‚Äì Dorota) he started acting in various Warsaw-based theatres, vari√©t√©s and cabarets (Qui Pro Quo, Perskie Oko and Cyrulik Warszawski being the most famous). He also played major roles in Warsaw-based \\"Teatr Polski\\" and Wilno-based \\"Teatr Lutnia\\". He is best known for his film roles; he played in more than thirty films. His screen debut was a 1925 silent film Rywale. With the advent of sound film Bodo in a matter of years became one of the best-known Polish actors. Usually appearing in musical comedies, already in 1932 he was voted the King of Polish Actors by Film magazine's readers. His popularity rose following three mistaken identity comedies: 1933 His Excellency, The Shop Assistant, 1935 His Excellency, the Chauffeur (both directed by Micha≈Ç Waszy≈Ñski and co-starring Ina Benita) and 1934 Czy Lucyna to dziewczyna? (co-starring Jadwiga Smosarska).Haltof (2002), pp. 31‚Äì39 Always appearing well-dressed, in 1936 Bodo was awarded the title of King of Style by the readers of Film magazine.Sieradzka (2003), p.147 In 1931 Bodo became a co- founder of the B.W.B. film studio, and, in 1933, he opened a private producers' company \\"Urania\\", named after his fathers' cinema in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. His best-known film was 1937 Piƒôtro wy≈ºej, which he wrote and produced himself. On 10 January 1939 Bodo with his business partner Zygmunt Woyciechowski opened a restaurant and a caf√© ‚Äì the \\"Caf√© Bodo\\" ‚Äì at Warsaw's prestigious Pierackiego street (modern Foksal).Mo≈õcicki (2009), pp. 41‚Äì42 By that time his popularity reached far beyond the borders of Poland, to the extent that Yugoslavian press dubbed him Polish Maurice Chevalier.Petroviƒá (1941), p.214 Bodo himself toured Germany promoting Polish-made feature films on that market.Kr√≥l (2006), pp. 153‚Äì157 Eugeniusz Bodo after arrest by NKVD. Last photo During the invasion of Poland he organized recitals for the Polish soldiers and civilians during the Siege of Warsaw. He then fled to Lw√≥w, where he joined the Tea-Jazz band led by Henryk Wars. With that troupe he toured Soviet Union in 1940, he also published a record containing Russian-language versions of his songs. Simultaneously he started efforts to leave the Soviet Union using his Swiss passport. However, shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union he was arrested by the NKVDCie≈õlikowa (1997), p.247 and sentenced to 5 years of lager/labor camp as a result of NKVD Interrogation carried out by NKVD chief Pyotr Fedotov signed on 20 October 1942 (source: documents sent to Poland by the Russian Red Cross in 1992). Initially imprisoned in Butyrki prison in Moscow, he was not released following the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement as the Soviet authorities argued that he was not a Pole but rather a Swiss citizen and hence the Amnesty for Polish citizens in the Soviet Union did not apply to him. Eugeniusz Bodo starved to death on his way to a remote Soviet gulag camp, in Kotlas. He was declared dead on 7 October 1943. His whereabouts remained unknown for another 50 years, before the collapse of communism in 1989 the Soviets gave the false version that Bodo had been murdered by the Germans in 1941. This version is repeated even in some modern publications.Vazzana (2001), p.52 It was only in 1991 that the Soviet authorities revealed his fate. The tragic circumstances surrounding Bodo's death became the subject of a documentary by Stanis≈Çaw Janicki Eugeniusz Bodo: Za winy niepope≈Çnione (For Crimes Not Committed). The title of the 1997 documentary refers to a 1938 film in which Bodo starred.Haltof (2002), p.54 In October 2011 in Kotlas, where he died, a cenotaph in his honor was unveiled at a local cemetery.

Historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire, it has a population of 1,873. Grimethorpe is located to the east of Barnsley and south of Hemsworth; until the local government reorganisation of 1974, it was part of the Hemsworth district and constituency. At the 2011 Census the village was part of the North East ward of Barnsley MBC. For much of the 20th century Grimethorpe's economy was rooted in coal mining. Since the 1984‚Äì85 miners' strike accelerated the downscale of UK coal mining and international cheap open-cast mining provoked closure of its colliery in May 1993. History It is believed the name Grimethorpe originates from \\"Grim's Torp\\", a mixture of Anglo-Saxon and Viking names, meaning a torp or hamlet owned by a Viking named Grimey. Grimethorpe is at the foot of the hill upon which is the village of Brierley. In fact, Grimethorpe was likely named such as a Norse farm built close to Brierley village. Following the Norman conquest, the Brierley-Grimethorpe area came under the rule of the De Laceys of Pontefract, with a local Saxon owner. In 1066, this owner was Ernui who was said to have six carucates of land at Brerelia and Hindelia, valued at forty shillings. (A carucate was as much land as could be ploughed in one year by one plough and eight oxen. An acre was as much land as could be ploughed in one day by one plough and a pair of oxen.)Brereley - A History of Brierley, by M. R. Watson & M. Harrison, First Edition 1975, Reprinted 1976, Anchor Press, Barnsley Road, Cudworth This land was given after the Norman conquest to Airic who was given the whole of Staincross wapentake by Ilbert de Lacey, the Norman of Pontefract. All of Yorkshire was divided into wapentakes, Staincross being the one for Barnsley area. It was about ten miles from north to south and about twenty miles from east to west, its boundaries being in the northeast the high ridge on which Brierley stands and in the southwest the water shed of the Pennines. A stone cross called Ladycross was erected near Grimethorpe, probably by the monks of Monk Bretton Priory, as a place of sanctuary, there being an old law protecting people on Church lands. The Ladycross figures on many deeds relating to the priory. The Lady referred to in the place names of Ladycross, Ladywell and Ladywood is probably Mary Magdalene to whom Monk Bretton Priory was dedicated. On a well- hidden site between Brierley and Grimethorpe stood the fortified Manor of Hall Steads (the name means 'hall site'), which belonged to the early Brereley estate. Hall Steads is not mentioned until 1284 in connection with a later Lord of Brierley Manor. Hall Steads was surrounded first by a high, stone wall and then by the moat. The site covered an area of about five acres. The building was mainly of local sandstone and many of the stones can still be seen in the soil. Fragments of 14th and 15th century pottery have been found amongst these stones.Brereley - A History of Brierley, by M. R. Watson & M. Harrison, First Edition 1975, Reprinted 1976, Anchor Press, Barnsley Road, Cudworth Mining Remediation of a slag heap in 2006; left from Grimethorpe's mining days. The 1981 census recorded 44% of Grimethorpe workers as miners. The two pits in the village were 'Grimethorpe' and 'Ferrymoor' which merged with 'Riddings' in 1967, which in turn merged with 'South Kirkby' in 1985. Grimethorpe colliery was one of the deepest pits in Britain and, following similar mergers with 'Houghton Main' and 'Dearne Valley', employed 6,000 men at the time of its closure in May 1993. During mid-October of the 1984-85 miners' strike, there was a series of riots in Grimethorpe and local residents complained that the policing was too heavy-handed. Relations between the community and the police remained very cold for the next decade. Deprivation After the closure of the mines and other local industry Grimethorpe entered a period of decline. Unemployment was above 50% for much of the 1990s. Long-term deprivation was identified by local social workers, the public sector and charities by the 2000s. This sparked a period of regeneration and much of the denser basic housing was demolished and replaced with new housing stock. Historically Grimethorpe had road links to the major compass points without natural barriers but was distant to major cities and its public transport was represented by long-distance bus routes; comparable ex-mining-centric villages in West Yorkshire such as Fitzwilliam and South Elmsall have rail links to Leeds and a greater population supporting local retail and commerce. Regeneration projects New private housing being built in Grimethorpe as part of its regeneration in 2005. Several regeneration projects have taken place. The Dearne Valley link roads have been constructed and Park Springs Industrial Estate has been developed. This has brought many jobs to the area especially the construction of a huge unit occupied by South Yorkshire-based furniture company Symphony. The village has seen the construction of four private housing estates, a medical centre, dental surgery and village hall. Regeneration was praised by former Deputy PM Lord Prescott on his visit in March 2010. Since this time regeneration work has continued with the opening of the large ASOS distribution centre, and many other industrial units on the Park Springs Industrial Estate. Education Two junior schools, Milefield and Ladywood, are publicly maintained. Willowgarth High School was demolished to be replaced by larger Outwood Academy Shafton, the secondary school with a main catchment area including Grimethorpe, Shafton, Brierley, Cudworth, Monk Bretton and Lundwood. Former schools include Springvale Junior and Middle School, which burned down in the 1980s. Band Grimethorpe is known for its past as a mining village, its brass band, the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and its use as the location for the film Brassed Off ‚Äì a black comedy which tells the plight of the village and the effect on its band. In 2010 Grimethorpe Colliery band recorded a version of the hymn \\"Jerusalem\\" which was played when the English team won a gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in India. Sport Grimethorpe has had two senior football clubs ‚Äì Grimethorpe Athletic, who played in the FA Cup from 1904 to 1953, and Grimethorpe Miners' Welfare, who competed in the FA Vase. In 2018 former Barnsley FC player Bruce Dyer opened a branch of his 'love life' football academy in the village. In the Viz comic strip Billy the Fish, the fictional Grimethorpe City is the arch-rival of Fish's team Fulchester United.

It evolved from the marabi sound and brought South African music to international prominence in the 1950s. The music has its roots in southern Africa but later adaptations of this and many other African folk idioms have permeated Western music (listen to the albums A Swingin' Safari by the Bert Kaempfert Orchestra (1962) and Graceland by Paul Simon (1986)), giving modern South African music, particularly jazz, much of its distinctive sound and lilting swagger. One reason for the use of the pennywhistle is that it is cheap and portable, but it also lends itself as a solo or an ensemble instrument. The popularity of the pennywhistle may have been based on the fact that flutes of different kinds have long been traditional instruments among the peoples of the more northerly parts of South Africa, and the pennywhistle thus enabled the swift adaptation of folk tunes into the new marabi-influenced music. Origin The most common explanation for the word \\"khwela\\" is that it is taken from the Zulu for \\"Climb\\", though in township slang it also referred to the police vans, the \\"khwela-khwela\\". Thus, it could be an invitation to join the dance, as well as serving as a warning. It is said that the young men who played the pennywhistle on street corners also acted as lookouts to warn those enjoying themselves in the shebeens of the arrival of the police. Kwela music was influenced by blending the music of Malawian immigrants to South Africa, together with the local South African sounds.Nikki Jecks, \\"Reviving Malawi's music heritage\\", BBC World Service, 6 August 2009. In Chichewa, the word Khwela has a very similar meaning to the South African meaning: \\"to climb\\". The music was popularised in South Africa and then brought to Malawi, where contemporary Malawian artists have also begun producing Khwela music. I-IV-I{}^6_4-V. Although it has been asserted that Khwela music exclusively uses the chord progression I-IV-I{}^6_4-V.,Manuel, Peter (1990). Popular Musics of the Non-Western World: An Introductory Survey, p.11. . others maintain that there is no specific Khwela chord progression, and that I-IV-V-I and I-I-IV-V are particularly prevalent.Allen, Lara (1999). \\"Kwela: the Structure and Sound of Pennywhistle Music\\", p.229. . Artists Artists such as Lemmy Mabaso were renowned for their pennywhistle skills, and Spokes Mashiyane was one of the most prominent with his kwela pennywhistle tunes. Other artists include The Skylarks, Jack Lerole, Aaron Lerole, The Solven Whistlers, Kippie Moeketsi, Donald Kachamba and Gwigwi Mrwebe.

","title":"Into the Fire"},{"id":"556799","text":"Thujopsis () is a genus of conifers in the cypress family (Cupressaceae), the sole member of which is Thujopsis dolabrata. It is endemic to Japan, where it is named asunaro (). It is similar to the closely related genus Thuja (arborvitae), differing in the broader, thicker leaves and thick cones. It is also called hiba, false arborvitae, or hiba arborvitae. A popular allegory for the meaning behind asunaro is _asu_ wa hinoki ni _naro_ u (), literally \\"tomorrow it will become a hinoki cypress\\", i.e. the tree looks like a smaller version of the common hinoki cypress. In Japan, other than being called asunaro, it also goes by the name hiba (). There are also a few regional variations, with asunaro being called ate () in Ishikawa, and atebi on Sado island. Thujopsis is a medium to large evergreen tree, reaching up to 40 m tall and 1.5 m trunk diameter, with red-brown bark which peels in vertical strips. The leaves are arranged in decussate pairs, scale-like, 3‚Äì10 mm long, glossy green above, and marked with vivid white stomatal bands below; they have a distinctive thick, almost fleshy texture. The seed cones are ovoid, 7‚Äì15 mm long and 6‚Äì10 mm diameter, with 6‚Äì12 thick scales, brown with a violet-white wax bloom when fresh. There are two varieties: * Thujopsis dolabrata var. dolabrata. Central and southern Japan. Shoots less densely branched with slightly larger leaves, and strongly thickened cone scales. * Thujopsis dolabrata var. hondai. Northern Japan. Shoots more densely branched with slightly smaller leaves, and less thickened cone scales. Uses The asunaro is a valued ornamental tree both in its native Japan, where it is commonly planted around temples as well as in gardens, and also in Europe and North America. In the latter two regions, planting is confined to areas with good rainfall or in gardens with reliable irrigation, as the species is not drought tolerant. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is also used to a small extent in forestry in Japan, grown for the valuable wood, which is durable and scented, similar to that of Thuja plicata.

She has been the Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney since 2004 and is currently the longest serving Lord Mayor of Sydney since the creation of the City of Sydney in 1842. She was an independent member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1988 to 2012, representing the electorates of Bligh (1988‚Äì2007) and Sydney (2007‚Äì2012). Moore is the first popularly elected female Lord Mayor of Sydney. Early life and background Clover Margaret Collins was born in 1945 and grew up in the suburb of Gordon, on Sydney's North Shore, one of three daughters of Kathleen and Francis Collins. She attended Loreto Kirribilli at Kirribilli and Elm Court Dominican Convent, Moss Vale. Moore matriculated to the University of Sydney, and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1969 and a Diploma of Education from the Sydney Teachers' College, and resided at Sancta Sophia College. After graduation she began work as an English and History teacher at Fort Street High School, before moving to London to teach for several years. Moore married Peter Moore, an architect, in 1972 and they had two children, Sophie and Tom. They returned to Australia five years later and settled in the inner-city suburb of Redfern. Moore was elected to the South Sydney Municipal Council in 1980. However, in 1981, the New South Wales Government amalgamated the South Sydney Council with the City of Sydney, and Moore was subsequently elected to the newly formed Sydney City Council from 1981. Moore developed a visible profile in the community, campaigning on a variety of issues both in her position as councillor and in the broader community. Moore was interested in heritage preservation, being involved in the unsuccessful campaign to save the 1936 Rural Bank Building in Martin Place and describing the ALP Lord Mayor, Doug Sutherland, as the \\"Judas of Martin Place\\" for his role in approving its demolition in 1982. In late 1987, Moore was the favourite to become the city's first female Lord Mayor and defeat incumbent Doug Sutherland. In 1987 the state government abruptly sacked the Sydney City Council and appointed a board of commissioners to run it until new elections could be held. Member of Parliament Oxford Street, Paddington, in 2010. Instead of standing again for council, Moore decided to run for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an independent at the 1988 election. Despite not having the backing of a party, she won the seat of Bligh, narrowly defeating Liberal member Michael Yabsley. In 1991 she co- authored the New South Wales Charter of Reform of Government. In the same year, she was re-elected for a second term with a massive swing in her favour, increasing her share from 26.7 per cent to 43 per cent. Her power also increased dramatically when, along with fellow independents Peter Macdonald and Tony Windsor, she gained the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly. Moore was to again take the spotlight when the Independent Commission Against Corruption handed down a finding that was sharply critical of Liberal Premier Nick Greiner on 1 June 1992. While the findings were still pending a ruling in the NSW Court of Appeals, Moore and two other Independent MPs made a symbolic march to the NSW Parliament with a threat to withdraw their support of the coalition's minority-government. Hence before the Court ruling was handed down, Greiner's hand was forced, and he resigned on 24 June 1992. She went on to hold her seat with a largely safe margin at the 1995 and 1999 elections. The LGBT community thanked her for her support by featuring likenesses of her in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade that year. She was re-elected again in 2003. Prior to the 2007 election, the Electoral Commission redistributed electoral boundaries, renaming Bligh to \\"Sydney\\", and moving the seat north and west to encompass the Sydney CBD. Moore was elected to the new seat of Sydney with an increased margin. Although she sat as an independent in parliament, Moore often worked with other minor parties and independents, particularly with the Australian Democrats, who sponsored some of her bills in the upper house and Moore encouraged voters at the 2011 state election to vote for the Democrats in the upper house, along with South Coast Independent MP, John Hatton. Moore resigned as a state MP as a result of new state laws (labelled in the media as the \\"Get Clover\\" laws) preventing dual membership of state parliament and local councils. Following her re-election as mayor in the 2012 elections, she was forced to resign the state seat she held for 24 years before the first meeting of the new council. This resulted in a 2012 Sydney by-election on 27 October in which she endorsed independent candidate Alex Greenwich of the Australian Marriage Equality advocacy group who won in a landslide victory. Lord Mayor of Sydney In early 2004, the Labor Party government under Bob Carr sacked and re-amalgamated the City of Sydney and South Sydney Councils. The move came largely as a surprise, with then-Lord Mayor Lucy Turnbull being notified by a fax posted under her door. The decision to amalgamate the two councils was widely interpreted by the media as an attempt to get the Labor candidate, former federal minister Michael Lee, elected as Lord Mayor, as it would bring a large area of largely Labor-voting suburbs into the City of Sydney. However, several of these suburbs also made up Moore's state electorate of Bligh. When Turnbull announced soon after that she would not seek re-election, Lee appeared to have the position won. Then, on 24 February, Moore entered the race, labelling the council's sacking a \\"cynical grab for power.\\" Despite her ideological differences with Turnbull, she also sharply denounced the sacking of a democratically elected mayor. By the following day, The Sydney Morning Herald was already predicting that she would present a serious challenge to Lee. Despite a spirited challenge from Lee, who was supported by much of the business community which had concerns about Moore's anti-development stance, Moore won. She finished with more than double the vote of her nearest rival, Lee, and ABC election analyst Antony Green announced that she would \\"romp through\\" to win, only 90 minutes after counting began. Though she had made a point of not directing voting preferences in her four election campaigns in the Legislative Assembly, Moore decided to support a team of independents for the council race. This turned out to be quite successful, with four of her team of six ‚Äì John McInerney, Robyn Kemmis, Marcelle Hoff and Phillip Black ‚Äì being elected to council. In 2008 NSW local government elections Moore was re-elected as Lord Mayor of Sydney. She was returned on a reduced majority in 2012, winning 51.1% of the Mayoral vote. In the 2016 NSW local government elections she was comfortably returned to office, improving her vote 8.0% to win 59.1% of the popular vote. After introducing bike lanes through many parts of inner Sydney, Moore broke an ankle on Ride to Work Day in October 2010, while dismounting from her bike, necessitating that she attend some events in a wheelchair. =Energy efficiency= Under Moore's leadership, the city of Sydney is aiming to reduce carbon emissions 70 per cent by 2030. It has installed bicycle lanes; upgraded its car fleet to hybrids; planted 10,000 trees; provided 600 on-street car- share spaces; installed Sydney's largest building-based solar photovoltaic system; installed water harvesting in 11 major parks and voted to install two new trigeneration plants. Moore stated in an article on Impakter.com in September 2018 that emissions in Sydney have been reduced by 52% and the use of water by 36% since the year 2006 and that the city aims to become carbon neutral. =Building and infrastructure= Since becoming Mayor, Moore has been able to bring to completion the construction of several buildings and pieces of infrastructure. * Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (formerly \\"Ultimo Aquatic Centre\\") by Harry Seidler * Surry Hills City of Sydney Library by FJMT (Francis-Jones Morehen Thorpe) * Paddington Reservoir Gardens by TZG (Tonkin Zulaikha Greer) * Redfern Park by BVN (Bligh Voller Nield) * Reg Bartley Oval grandstand and kiosk, Rushcutters Bay, by Lacoste+Stevenson * Pirrama Park in Pyrmont by ASPECT StudiosLandscape Architects' website * Prince Alfred Park makeover near Central railway station by Rachel Neeson and Nick Murcutt. * Burton Street Tabernacle (to become the new Tabernacle Theatre) There are also: * Parks throughout Glebe, Pyrmont, Surry Hills, Rosebery, Elizabeth Bay and St Peters * The introduction of a system of cycleways for Sydney. =Controversies= On 27 October 2007 Moore proposed a Private Members Bill that would ban the sale of dogs, cats and other mammals in NSW pet stores, and effectively ban the breeding of crossbred dogs. The Pet Industry Association responded with a petition opposing the legislation. The RSPCA Australia has given its support to the measure, although it was rejected by NSW purebred dog breeders. Bike lanes constructed through Sydney angered many local residents for reducing parking and critics attacked the cost while other groups, including local headmasters and school groups, applauded them. The Bourke Street Cycleway won a Sydney Design Award in 2012. The \\"City of Sydney Amendment (Elections) Amendment Bill\\", became law in September 2014, replacing one optional vote per business with two compulsory votes and it has been alleged that this is one of \\"two statutes designed to bar her from public life\\". Between 2014 and 2017 'Cloud Arch', a steel sculpture intended to be installed over George Street in Sydney, had its budget rise from to 11.3 million dollars. It has been criticised for both the rise in cost, after a re- design, and for not being suited to the city's aesthetic.

Popular for its nest made of leaves \\"sewn\\" together and immortalized by Rudyard Kipling as Darzee in his Jungle Book, it is a common resident in urban gardens. Although shy birds that are usually hidden within vegetation, their loud calls are familiar and give away their presence. They are distinctive in having a long upright tail, greenish upper body plumage and rust coloured forehead and crown. This passerine bird is typically found in open farmland, scrub, forest edges and gardens. Tailorbirds get their name from the way their nest is constructed. The edges of a large leaf are pierced and sewn together with plant fibre or spider silk to make a cradle in which the actual nest is built. Taxonomy and systematics The scientific name sutorius means \\"cobbler\\" rather than \\"tailor\\" while Orthotomus means \\"straight-cutting\\". The species was earlier placed in the family Sylviidae but more recent molecular studies place the species within the family Cisticolidae, along with Prinia and Cisticola. A number of subspecies are recognized within its widespread range in South Asia and Southeast Asia. The nominate race is from the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Race O. s. fernandonis is found in the highlands of Sri Lanka. Neighbouring India has O.s. guzuratus in the peninsula and west to Pakistan while towards the north O. s. patia is found in the Terai of Nepal along the Himalayan foothills until Myanmar. A small population of O. s. patia is also found in the northern Eastern Ghats (Wangasara). The hills of northeastern India have O. s. luteus. In Southeast Asia O. s. inexpectatus and O. s. maculicollis are found in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam. South east China, including the island of Hainan, and Tonkin in Vietnam have O. s. longicauda while O. s. edela is found on Java. Description The common tailorbird is a brightly coloured bird, with bright green upperparts and creamy underparts. They range in size from and weigh . They have short rounded wings, a long tail, strong legs and a sharp bill with curved tip to the upper mandible. They are wren- like with a long upright tail that is often moved around. The crown is rufous and the upperparts are predominantly olive green. The underside is creamy white. The sexes are identical, except that the male has long central tail feathers in the breeding season, although the reliability of sexing data accompanying museum specimens used in determining this sexual dimorphism has been questioned. Young birds are duller. When calling, the dark patches on the sides of the neck become visible. These are due to the dark pigmented and bare skin that are present in both sexes and sometimes give the appearance of a dark gorget. Behaviour and ecology Foraging for insects Like most warblers, the common tailorbird is insectivorous. The song is a loud ' with variations across the populations. The disyllabic calls are repeated often. Tailorbirds are found singly or in pairs, usually low in the undergrowth or trees, sometimes hopping on the ground. They forage for insects and have been known to feed on a range of beetles and bugs. They are attracted to insects at flowers and are known to favour the inflorescences of mango. They also visit flowers such as those of Bombax, Salmalia for nectar and are sometimes covered in pollen, giving them a golden-headed appearance. The birds roost alone during the non-breeding season but may roost side-by-side during the breeding season, sometimes with the newly fledged juvenile sandwiched between the adults. The roost sites chosen are thin twigs on trees with cover above them and were often close to human habitation and lights. =Breeding= Nest showing the rivets The breeding season is March to December peaking from June to August in India, coinciding with the wet season. In Sri Lanka the main breeding periods are March to May and August to September, although they can breed throughout the year. Although the name is derived from their nest construction habit, the nest is not unique and is also found in many Prinia warblers. The nest is a deep cup, lined with soft materials and placed in thick foliage and the leaves holding the nest have the upper surfaces outwards making it difficult to spot. The punctures made on the edge of the leaves are minute and do not cause browning of the leaves, further aiding camouflage. The nest lining of a nest in Sri Lanka that was studied by Casey Wood was found to be lined with lint from Euphorbia, Ceiba pentandra and Bombax malabaricum species. Jerdon wrote that the bird made knots, however no knots are used. Wood classified the processes used by the tailorbird in nest as sewing, rivetting, lacing and matting. In some cases the nest is made from a single large leaf, the margins of which are rivetted together. Sometimes the fibres from one rivet are extended into an adjoining puncture and appearing more like sewing. The stitch is made by piercing two leaves and drawing fibre through them. The fibres fluff out on the outside and in effect they are more like rivets. There are many variations in the nest and some may altogether lack the cradle of leaves. One observer noted that the birds did not utilize cotton that was made available while another observer, Edward Hamilton Aitken, was able to induce them to use artificially supplied cotton. The usual clutch is three eggs. The incubation period is about 12 days. Both male and female feed the young. Mortality of eggs and chicks is high due to predation by rodents, cats, crow-pheasants, lizards and other predators. The young birds fledge in about 14 days. The female alone incubates according to some sources, while others suggest that both sexes incubate; however, both parents take part in feeding and sanitation. The males are said to feed the incubating female. An unusual case of a pair of tailorbirds adopting chicks in an artificially translocated nest belonging to a different pair has been recorded. Nests are sometimes parasitized by the Plaintive Cuckoo (Cacomantis merulinus). In culture John Gould's engraving for Birds of Asia \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\", one of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book stories, includes a tailorbird couple, Darzee (which means \\"tailor\\" in Urdu) and his wife, as two of the key characters. Darzee's wife is said to have feigned injury, but this behaviour is unknown in this species.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; July 28, 1874 ‚Äì April 13, 1945) was a German philosopher. Trained within the Neo-Kantian Marburg School, he initially followed his mentor Hermann Cohen in attempting to supply an idealistic philosophy of science. After Cohen's death, Cassirer developed a theory of symbolism and used it to expand phenomenology of knowledge into a more general philosophy of culture. Cassirer was one of the leading 20th-century advocates of philosophical idealism. His most famous work is the Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923‚Äì1929). Though his work received a mixed reception shortly after his death, more recent scholarship has remarked upon Cassirer's role as a strident defender of the moral idealism of the Enlightenment era and the cause of liberal democracy at a time when the rise of fascism had made such advocacy unfashionable. Within the international Jewish community, Cassirer's work has additionally been seen as part of a long tradition of thought on ethical philosophy. Biography Born in Breslau in Silesia (modern-day southwest Poland), into a Jewish family, Cassirer studied literature and philosophy at the University of Marburg (where he completed his doctoral work in 1899 with a dissertation on Ren√© Descartes's analysis of mathematical and natural scientific knowledge entitled [Descartes' Critique of Mathematical and Scientific Knowledge]) and at the University of Berlin (where he completed his habilitation in 1906 with the dissertation [The Problem of Knowledge in Philosophy and Science in the Modern Age: Volume I]).A second volume appeared in 1907, a third one in 1920, and a fourth one in 1957. Politically, Cassirer supported the liberal German Democratic Party (DDP). After working for many years as a at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, Cassirer was elected in 1919 to the philosophy chair at the newly founded University of Hamburg, where he lectured until 1933, supervising amongst others the doctoral theses of Joachim Ritter and Leo Strauss. Because he was Jewish, he left Germany after the Nazis came to power in 1933. After leaving Germany he taught for a couple of years at the University of Oxford, before becoming a professor at Gothenburg University. When Cassirer considered Sweden too unsafe, he applied for a post at Harvard University, but was rejected because thirty years earlier he had rejected a job offer from them. In 1941 he became a visiting professor at Yale University, then moved to Columbia University in New York City, where he lectured from 1943 until his death in 1945. Cassirer died of a heart attack in April 1945 in New York City. His grave is located in Westwood, New Jersey, on the Cedar Park Beth-El Cemeteries in the graves of the Congregation Habonim. His son, Heinz Cassirer, was also a Kantian scholar. Influences Donald Phillip Verene, who published some of Cassirer's papers kept at Yale University, gave this overview of his ideas: > \\"Cassirer as a thinker became an embodiment of Kantian principles, but also > of much more, of an overall movement of spirit stretching from the > Renaissance to the Enlightenment, and on to Herder‚Äôs conception of history, > Goethe‚Äôs poetry, Wilhelm von Humboldt‚Äôs study of the Kavi language, > Schelling‚Äôs , Hegel‚Äôs Phenomenology of Spirit, and Vischer‚Äôs conception of > the aesthetic symbol, among many others. Cassirer‚Äôs own position is born > through a mastery of the whole development of this world of the humanistic > understanding, which included the rise of the scientific world view -- a > mastery evident both in his historical works and in his systematic > philosophy.\\" Work =History of science= Cassirer's first major published writings were a history of modern thought from the Renaissance to Kant. In accordance with his Marburg neo-Kantianism he concentrated upon epistemology. His reading of the scientific revolution, in books such as The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy (1927), as a \\"Platonic\\" application of mathematics to nature, influenced historians such as E. A. Burtt, E. J. Dijksterhuis, and Alexandre Koyr√©. =Philosophy of science= In Substance and Function (1910), he writes about late nineteenth-century developments in physics including relativity theory and the foundations of mathematics. In Einstein's Theory of Relativity (1921) he defended the claim that modern physics supports a neo- Kantian conception of knowledge. He also wrote a book about Quantum mechanics called Determinism and Indeterminism in Modern Physics (1936). =Philosophy of symbolic forms= At Hamburg Cassirer discovered the Library of the Cultural Sciences founded by Aby Warburg. Warburg was an art historian who was particularly interested in ritual and myth as sources of surviving forms of emotional expression. In Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923‚Äì29) Cassirer argues that man (as he put it in his more popular 1944 book Essay on Man) is a \\"symbolic animal\\". Whereas animals perceive their world by instincts and direct sensory perception, humans create a universe of symbolic meanings. Cassirer is particularly interested in natural language and myth. He argues that science and mathematics developed from natural language, and religion and art from myth. =The Cassirer‚ÄìHeidegger debate= In 1929 Cassirer took part in a historically significant encounter with Martin Heidegger in Davos during the Second Davos Hochschulkurs (the Cassirer‚ÄìHeidegger debate). Cassirer argues that while Kant's Critique of Pure Reason emphasizes human temporality and finitude, he also sought to situate human cognition within a broader conception of humanity. Cassirer challenges Heidegger's relativism by invoking the universal validity of truths discovered by the exact and moral sciences. =Philosophy of the Enlightenment= Cassirer believed that reason's self- realization leads to human liberation. Mazlish (2000), however, notes that Cassirer in his The Philosophy of the Enlightenment (1932) focuses exclusively on ideas, ignoring the political and social context in which they were produced. =The Logic of the Cultural Sciences= In The Logic of the Cultural Sciences (1942) Cassirer argues that objective and universal validity can be achieved not only in the sciences, but also in practical, cultural, moral, and aesthetic phenomena. Although inter-subjective objective validity in the natural sciences derives from universal laws of nature, Cassirer asserts that an analogous type of inter-subjective objective validity takes place in the cultural sciences. =The Myth of the State= Cassirer's last work, The Myth of the State (1946), was published posthumously; at one level it is an attempt to understand the intellectual origins of Nazi Germany. Cassirer sees Nazi Germany as a society in which the dangerous power of myth is not checked or subdued by superior forces. The book discusses the opposition of logos and mythos in Greek thought, Plato's Republic, the medieval theory of the state, Machiavelli, Thomas Carlyle's writings on hero worship, the racial theories of Arthur de Gobineau, and Hegel. Cassirer claimed that in 20th-century politics there was a return, with the passive acquiescence of Martin Heidegger, to the irrationality of myth, and in particular to a belief that there is such a thing as destiny. Of this passive acquiescence, Cassirer says that in departing from Husserl's belief in an objective, logical basis for philosophy, Heidegger attenuated the ability of philosophy to oppose the resurgence of myth in German politics of the 1930s.

Zverev was born in a little village just outside Moscow. After years in local politics, he rose to prominence as a Deputy Commissar of Finance, but he also held other lesser posts such as a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. As Deputy Commissar of Finance he was able to work up, and eventually get promoted to People's Commissar for Finance (renamed to Ministry in 1946). Later, Zverev gained a seat in both the Central Committee and the Presidium. During the Great Patriotic War he was responsible for providing funds for the Soviet military machine to fight the Germans. After the war he lost his Ministership, but was again made Minister of Finance late in 1948. He was replaced as Minister of Finance by Vasily Garbuzov in 1960. Zverev then held the office of Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for four convocations. He died in July 1969. Early life and career Zverev was born in Tikhomirovo Klin, Klinsky Uyezd, Moscow Oblast to a working-class family. Before attending university, Zverev worked from 1913 to 1919 at two factories, the first being Vysokovsky manufactory located in Moscow Oblast and Trekhgorny factory in the city of Moscow. By 1919 he had joined both the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) (RCP(b)) and the Red Army to fight in the Russian Civil War. He became a platoon commander over a cavalry regiment before the demobilization of the army in 1922. In 1922, he became the head of the local Agitation and Propaganda Department, and two years later, an agent of the provincial Financial Department of Moscow. He did however continue his work as an industrial worker for a short-period of time, before leaving for good. In 1927 he became Chairman of the Executive Committee of Klin, and later in 1929, Head of Tax Administration of the Financial Department of Smolensk Oblast. The following year he also became the Head of the Financial Department of Bryansk Oblast. From 1931 to 1932 he attended the Moscow Institute of Finance and Economics and from 1936 to 1937 a District Council Chairman in Moscow. In 1937 he became the First Secretary of the Molotov District Committee of the RCP(b) of Moscow. Zverev graduated and got his degree from the Moscow Institute of Finance in 1949. Minister of Finance (1938‚Äì1960) Due to mass arrests perpetrated by the Soviet state in the 1930s, known as the Great Purge, Zverev along with many others were quickly promoted to the top of Soviet bureaucracy. He was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1950 and again from 1954 to 1962. In the meantime he held a range of offices in government, the first being the position of Deputy Commissar for Finance in September 1937 but was again quickly promoted, this time to the office of the People's Commissar for Finance, the head of Soviet finance. Zverev was given a seat in the Central Committee in 1939. During the Great Patriotic War, Zverev was responsible for providing the necessary funds for the Soviet military for the production of new equipment. During the war, the price for goods also increased. In 1948, from February to December that same year, he was downgraded to Deputy Minister of Finance. He got his old office back in December 1948 and in October 1952 became a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee. He lost his seat following Stalin's death in 1953. Later years and death Following his leave as Minister of Finance, he became Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on 1-2 and 4-5 convocations before leaving politics for good. In 1961 he became a Professor of the All-Union Correspondence of Financial Institution. Zverev died in Moscow on 27 July 1969. He was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

Irish had diminished as a spoken tongue, remaining the main daily language only in isolated rural areas, with English having become the dominant language in the majority of Ireland. Interest in Gaelic culture was evident in the beginning of the nineteenth century with the formation of the Ulster Gaelic Society in 1830, and later in the scholarly works of John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry, and the foundation of the Ossianic Society. Concern for spoken Irish led to the formation of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language in 1876, and the Gaelic Union in 1880. The latter produced the Gaelic Journal. Irish sports were fostered by the Gaelic Athletics Association, founded in 1884. The Gaelic League () was established in 1893 by Eoin MacNeill and other enthusiasts of Gaelic language and culture. Its first president was Douglas Hyde. The objective of the League was to encourage the use of Irish in everyday life in order to counter the ongoing anglicisation of the country. It organised weekly gatherings to discuss Irish culture, hosted conversation meetings, edited and periodically published a newspaper named , and successfully campaigned to have Irish included in the school curriculum. The League grew quickly, having more than 48 branches within four years of its foundation and 400 within 10. It had fraught relationships with other cultural movements of the time, such as the Pan- Celtic movement and the Irish Literary Revival. Important writers of the Gaelic revival include , Patrick Pearse () and . Early movements Early pioneers of Irish scholarship were John O'Donovan, Eugene O'Curry and George Petrie; O'Donovan and O'Curry found an outlet for their work in the Archaeological Society, founded in 1840. From 1853, translations of Irish literary works, particularly mythological works of the Ossianic Cycle‚Äîassociated with the Fianna‚Äîwere published by the Ossianic Society, in which Standish Hayes O'Grady was active. The Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language was formed in 1877 by, among others, George Sigerson and Thomas O'Neill Russell. The secretary of that society, Father John Nolan, split with it in 1880 and formed the Gaelic Union, of which the president was The O'Conor Don, and whose members included Douglas Hyde and Michael Cusack.Tierney (1980), p. 17 Cusack's interest in Gaelic culture was not restricted to the language; he took a keen interest in the traditional games of Ireland, and in 1884, with Maurice Davin, he would found the Gaelic Athletic Association to promote the games of Gaelic football, hurling and handball. In 1882 the Gaelic Union began publication of a monthly journal, the Gaelic Journal. Its first editor was David Comyn; he was followed by John Fleming, a prominent Irish scholar, and then Father Eugene O'Growney. Gaelic League In November 1892 Douglas Hyde gave a lecture to the National Literary Society entitled \\"The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland.\\" He said that the Irish people had become almost completely anglicised, and that this could only be reversed through building up the language.Tierney (1980), p. 20 Eoin MacNeill followed this up with an article in the Gaelic Journal, \\"A Plea and a Plan for the Extension of the Movement to Preserve and Spread the Gaelic language in Ireland\\", and set about forming an organisation to help bring this about, together with Eugene O'Growney and J. H. Lloyd ().Tierney (1980), pp. 21‚Äì2 The Gaelic League () was founded on 31 July 1893. Hyde was elected president, MacNeill secretary, and Lloyd treasurer, and Thomas O'Neill Russell was among those elected to the council.Tierney (1980), p. 24 The Gaelic League held weekly meetings that were a combination of classes and conversation.Tierney (1980), p. 26 Its focus on the vernacular form of language and modern literature distinguished it from the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language, The Celtic Society and the Gaelic Union. Within months it had branches in Cork and Galway. After four years it had 43 branches, and after ten years more than 400.Tierney (1980), p. 28 Although it was more concerned with fostering the language in the home than with teaching it in schools, it was nonetheless successful in having Irish added to the curriculum; the number of schools teaching it rose from about a dozen in the 1880s to 1,300 in 1903.Tierney (1980), p. 42 The League took over the Gaelic Journal in 1894, when O'Growney retired as editor, with MacNeill replacing him. In January 1898 it began publication of a weekly newspaper, .Tierney (1980), p. 44 In March of the following year, following a dispute with the owner, this was replaced by , with MacNeill again as editor.Tierney (1980), p. 48 In 1901 MacNeill was replaced as editor by Eoghan √ì Neachtain, who was in turn replaced in 1903 by Patrick Pearse.Tierney (1980), p. 73 The League also concerned itself with the folk music of Ireland, and was involved in the movement which led to the organisation of the Feis Ceoil (Festival of Music) by Annie Patterson in 1897.Tierney (1980), pp. 29‚Äì30 The League's relations with contemporary cultural movements were strained, and sometimes hostile, despite the fact that some of the League's leaders were on friendly terms with those movements. Pan-Celticism was viewed with suspicion by many members because its leaders in Ireland, especially Lord Castletown, were closely associated with the Irish establishment. When Douglas Hyde was invited to the planned Pan-Celtic Congress of 1900‚Äîto be held in Dublin‚Äîas a delegate of the League, the (executive committee) refused to send any representative, though Hyde might attend as an individual if he wished. Hyde reluctantly declined to attend. The Irish Literary Revival was denounced because its works were written in English, not Irish, and therefore tended even more towards anglicisation. Eoin MacNeill wrote, \\"Let them write for the 'English-speaking world' or the 'English-speaking race' if they will. But let them not vex our ears by calling their writings Irish and national.\\"Tierney (1980), p. 66 Patrick Pearse said of the Irish Literary Theatre, recently founded by W. B.

Writers (Father Peter O'Leary), a parish priest from Castlelyons in County Cork, began contributing to the Gaelic Journal in 1894, and in November of that year he published the first instalment of , which was to become his best-known work. It was described by the journal as a \\"specimen of Munster Irish, one of the best samples, if not the very best, of southern popular Gaelic that has ever been printed.\\"Tierney (1980), p. 35 was the first major work of modern literature in Irish. serialised the in the Cork Weekly Examiner in 1900‚Äì1901, and followed it up with a series of modern renderings of ancient Irish tales such as , , and , all of which eschewed scholarship in favour of colloquial, entertaining Irish.

Patrick Pearse (), the editor of ‚Äîand later a revolutionary leader in the Easter Rising‚Äîwrote poetry, short stories and plays. He is considered the first modernist writer in Irish. Pearse rejected what he called the imposition of \\"dead linguistic and literary forms on a living language\\", but at the same time rejected the idea that only native speakers like could produce \\"Irish Irish\\".Edwards (1977), p. 97 He produced two books of short stories, (1907) and (1916). His collection of poems, (1914) contains his most famous poem, \\"\\" (\\"I am Ireland\\"). was arguably the best writer of the period. He wrote more than 400 short stories between 1901 and his death in 1928. His stories were darker than those of his contemporaries. According to his entry in the Dictionary of Irish Biography, they deal with \\"isolation, conflict between good and evil, the tragedy of life, hatred, blindness, despair, and madness.\\" He wrote one novel, (Exile), described by John T. Koch as a \\"strange and brooding psychological novel, the first of the genre in Irish\\", about a Connemara man living in London. 's works were controversial, addressing themes such as alcoholism and prostitution, which and others within the movement found objectionable.

March 31, 1905. p. 7. About a quarter of his roughly 600 songs survive. He influenced and was influenced by Brody singer Velvel Zbarzher, although it is not believed that they ever met. Born in Vilna, he grew up poor and first worked braiding lace in Kovno, where he was associated with the devout, moralistic Musar movement of Rabbi Israel Salanter. Later, he was drawn to the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, and adopted a more modern Orthodox Judaism that renounced superstition. Forcibly conscripted into the Russian Army just before his twentieth birthday, he was soon released due to Czar Alexander II's revocation of the harsh conscription law. The plight of Jewish draftees, or \\"cantonists\\" would be a major subject of his early poetry and songs. Sol Liptzin describes Zunser's songs as having \\"simple words and catchy tunes\\", singing of the \\"melancholy fate and few joys of the inarticulate masses\\" and writes that \\"his songs spread by word of mouth... until all Yiddish-speaking Jews were familiar with them\\". [Liptzin, 1972, 48] In 1861 he published a booklet of songs entitled Shirim Khadoshim, the first of about 50 publications in his lifetime. At this time, he was, in Liptzin's words, \\"primarily a Maskil\\"--a propagator of the Haskalah--\\"interested in instructing and aiding his people\\". However, his life took a tragic turn: not only did his wife die of cholera in the next decade, but all of their nine children as well, and he became, again quoting Liptzin, \\"a prophet of doom, admonishing his co- religionists not to venture too date along the alluring road of western enlightenment and assimilation...\\" [Liptzin, 1972, 49] When that doom came, in the form of the anti-Semitic reaction and pogrom after the assassination of Alexander II, he became again a comforter, as well as a Zionist, affiliated with the Hovevei Zion and Bilu pioneers, writing songs such as \\"Die Sokhe\\" (\\"The Plough\\") and \\"Shivath Zion\\" (\\"Homecoming to Zion\\"). Zunser emigrated to New York City in 1889, and worked as a printer.Hapgood, Hutchins, The Spirit of the Ghetto: Studies of the Jewish Quarter in New York, 1902 - chapter 4 However, life in New York was not conducive to his muse, and he wrote little in the years after his arrival in America, mostly poems rather than songs. En route to the New World, he wrote the hopeful \\"Columbus and Washington\\"; once there, he followed this with the far more disillusioned \\"Dos Goldene Land\\" (\\"The Golden Land\\") and \\"Der Greener\\" (\\"The Greenhorn\\"). His Zionism continued in a song urging the Jewish people to give up peddling and become farmers. Zunser was saved from penury in his final years by a benefit performance on his behalf held at Cooper Union on March 30, 1905, which raised enough money to give him a pension. He died on September 22, 1913, and was buried in Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn.  Works  *The Works of Elyokum Zunser: A Critical Edition, in two volumes, edited by Mordkhe Schaechter, YIVO, 1964.

Its clubhouse is Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. Member yachts are given the Suffix RYS to their names, and permitted to wear the White Ensign of the Royal NavyOverview: The Royal Yacht Squadron rather than the merchant Red Ensign worn by the majority of other UK registered vessels. The club's patron is Queen Elizabeth II and the club's admiral is Prince Philip who is also a former club commodore. History Founded on 1 June 1815 in the Thatched House Tavern in St James's, London as The Yacht Club by 42 gentlemen interested in sea yachting,British Attractions ‚Äì Royal Yacht Squadron ‚Äì Outdoor Venue the original members decided to meet in London and in Cowes twice a year, to discuss yachting over dinner. Membership was restricted to those who owned a vessel not under 10 tons. Today this is interpreted as a gentleman \\"actively interested in yachting\\".Overview: The Royal Yacht Squadron The Earl of Yarborough, later first commodore of the club, welcomed the Prince Regent as a member in 1817. In 1820, when the Prince Regent became George IV, it was renamed the Royal Yacht Club. The club started organising racing as a principal feature of the annual regatta, which is now known as Cowes Week. In 1833, William IV renamed the club The Royal Yacht Squadron. Its association with the Royal Navy began early and Nelson's captain at Trafalgar, Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, headed the list of naval members. The spirit of invention led to yachts \\"of such celerity in sailing and beauty of construction\\" that they were of utility to the Royal Navy. In 1829, the Admiralty issued a warrant to wear what is now the navy's White Ensign. The burgee (a triangular shaped flag identifying yacht club membership) is differenced with a St George's Cross and crown on a white background. In 1851, one of the \\"forred\\" hands, on board the yacht America concerning the first sailing of the America's Cup, 1851 wrote 'The Royal Yacht Club‚ÄîIn a fix' (tune). \\"Come listen to my ditty, and a song to you I'll sing...\\"'The Royal Yacht Club‚ÄîIn a fix.'(United States : s.n., 1851) Another naval connection is that the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. To enable the application of naval discipline on board a civilian ship, he registered the Terra Nova RYS as a yacht of the squadron and sailed under the White Ensign on his second and final expedition to Antarctica in 1910. In August 2013, the members of Royal Yacht Squadron voted to allow full membership to women, which had been restricted since its foundation.Kate Laven, Sam Marsden & Rebecca Abrahams, ‚ÄúRoyal Yacht Squadron to admit women as members for the first time in 198-year history,‚Äù The Telegraph, 5 August 2013 Racing Genesta (1885), the club's first challenger for the America's Cup In 1851, the club's commodore, visiting the Great Exhibition, issued a challenge for the squadron's ¬£100 Cup for a race around the island. The New York City‚Äìbased America, representing the New York Yacht Club, triumphed in this race, giving its name to one of the oldest and best-known trophies: the America's Cup. The victory was witnessed by Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales, later commodore of the club and Edward VII. The site is also used as the start of the Round the Island Race which occurs annually. During the American Civil War Deerhound RYS witnessed the fight between USS Kearsarge and the Confederate cruiser CSS Alabama. Gazelle RYS rescued the Empress Eugenie at the end of the Franco-Prussian War and the squadron yachts supplied British soldiers in the Crimean War. The German Kaiser brought the 1887 America's Cup challenger Thistle to Cowes in 1892, which encouraged the Prince of Wales to build the royal cutter yacht Britannia, one of the most successful racing yachts of all time. The Pavilion The Bronze Mermaid by Jonathan Wylder on the breakwater of the RYS Haven, which was modelled on Sharron Davies The Pavilion, designed by Sir Thomas Croft, was opened in 2000. This elegant creation provides on shore facilities for yachtsmen and their families while allowing the castle to retain its 'country house' ambiance.

The term bazaar originates from the Persian word bƒÅzƒÅr. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer to the \\"network of merchants, bankers and craftsmen\\" who work in that area. Although the word \\"bazaar\\" is of Persian origin, its use has spread and now has been accepted into the vernacular in countries around the world. The term souk ( suq, shuq, Syriac: ‹´‹ò‹©‹ê shuqa, shuka, Spanish: zoco, also spelled souq, shuk, shooq, soq, esouk, succ, suk, sooq, suq, soek) is used in Western Asian, North African and some Horn African cities (). Evidence for the existence of bazaars or souks dates to around 3,000 BCE. Although the lack of archaeological evidence has limited detailed studies of the evolution of bazaars, indications suggest that they initially developed outside city walls where they were often associated with servicing the needs of caravanserai. As towns and cities became more populous, these bazaars moved into the city center and developed in a linear pattern along streets stretching from one city gate to another gate on the opposite side of the city. Souks became covered walkways. Over time, these bazaars formed a network of trading centres which allowed for the exchange of produce and information. The rise of large bazaars and stock trading centres in the Muslim world allowed the creation of new capitals and eventually new empires. New and wealthy cities such as Isfahan, Golconda, Samarkand, Cairo, Baghdad and Timbuktu were founded along trade routes and bazaars. Street markets are the European and North American equivalents. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Western interest in Oriental culture led to the publication of many books about daily life in Middle Eastern countries. Souks, bazaars and the trappings of trade feature prominently in paintings and engravings, works of fiction and travel writing. Shopping at a bazaar or market-place remains a central feature of daily life in many Middle-Eastern and South Asian cities and towns and the bazaar remains the \\"beating heart\\" of West Asian and South Asian life; in the Middle East, souks tend to be found in a city's medina (old quarter) Bazaars and souks are often important tourist attractions. A number of bazaar districts have been listed as World Heritage sites due to their historical and/or architectural significance. Terminology by region In general a souk is synonymous with a bazaar or marketplace, and the term souk is used in Arabic-speaking countries. =Bazaar= Souk in Amman The Grand Bazaar, Istanbul, by Amadeo Preziosi, late 19th century The origin of the word bazaar comes from Persian bƒÅzƒÅr. from Middle Persian wƒÅzƒÅr, from Old Persian vƒÅƒçar, from Proto-Indo-Iranian *wahƒÅ-ƒçarana. The term, bazaar, spread from Persia into Arabia and ultimately throughout the Middle East.Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/topic/bazaar Differing meanings of ‚Äúbazaar‚Äù In North America, the United Kingdom and some other European countries, the term charity bazaar can be used as a synonym for a \\"rummage sale\\", to describe charity fundraising events held by churches or other community organisations in which either donated used goods (such as books, clothes and household items) or new and handcrafted (or home- baked) goods are sold for low prices, as at a church or other organisation's Christmas bazaar, for example. Although Turkey offers many famous markets known as \\"bazaars\\" in English, the Turkish word \\"pazar\\" refers to an outdoor market held at regular intervals, not a permanent structure containing shops. English place names usually translate \\"√ßar≈üƒ±\\" (shopping district) as \\"bazaar\\" when they refer to an area with covered streets or passages. For example, the Turkish name for the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is \\"Kapalƒ±√ßar≈üƒ±\\" (gated shopping area), while the Spice Bazaar is the \\"Mƒ±sƒ±r √áar≈üƒ±sƒ±\\" (Egyptian shopping area). In Czechia, the word \\"bazar\\" means second-hand shop. \\"Autobazar\\" is a shop which purchases and sells pre-owned cars. Variations In Indonesian, the word pasar means \\"market.\\" The capital of Bali province, in Indonesia, is Denpasar, which means \\"north market.\\" =Souk= Souk in Dubai, the Deira Souks The Arabic word is a loan from Aramaic \\"≈°≈´qƒÅ\\" (‚Äústreet, market‚Äù), itself a loanword from the Akkadian \\"s≈´qu\\" (‚Äústreet‚Äù, from \\"sƒÅqu\\", meaning ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù). The spelling souk entered European languages probably through French during the French occupation of the Arab countries Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, the word \\"souk\\" most likely refers to Arabic/North African traditional markets. Other spellings of this word involving the letter \\"Q\\" (sooq, souq, so'oq...) were likely developed using English and thus refer to Western Asian/Arab traditional markets, as British colonialism was present there during the 19th and 20th centuries. In Modern Standard Arabic the term al-sooq refers to markets in both the physical sense and the abstract economic sense (e.g., an Arabic-speaker would speak of the sooq in the old city as well as the sooq for oil, and would call the concept of the free market ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸàŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±Ÿë as-s≈´q al-·∏•urr). Variations on \\"souk\\" In northern Morocco, the Spanish corruption socco is often used as in the Grand Socco and Petit Socco of Tangiers. In the Indian subcontinent the corruption, 'chowk', is often used in place of souk. The term is often used generically to designate the market in any Western Asian city, but may also be used in Western cities, particularly those with a Muslim community. In Malta the terms suq and sometimes monti are used for a marketplace. In the United States, especially Southern California and Nevada, an indoor swap meet is a type of bazaar, i.e. a permanent, indoor shopping center open during normal retail hours, with fixed \\"booths\\" or counters for the vendors.https://lasvegassun.com/news/2019/feb/28/las-vegas-epic-second-hand- shops-antique-stores-an/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1992-07-08-mn-1515-story.html  History  =Origins= Troopers in the Bazaar, India, by Edwin Lord Weeks, 19th century Bazaars originated in the Middle East, probably in Persia.

Bazaars were typically situated in close proximity to ruling palaces, citadels or mosques, not only because the city afforded traders some protection, but also because palaces and cities generated substantial demand for goods and services.Harris, K., \\"The Bazaar\\" The United States Institute of Peace, Bazaars located along these trade routes, formed networks, linking major cities with each other and in which goods, culture, people and information could be exchanged.Hanachi, P. and Yadollah, S., \\"Tabriz Historical Bazaar in the Context of Change,\\" ICOMOS Conference Proceedings, Paris, 2011 The Greek historian, Herodotus, noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remain at home weaving cloth.Thamis, \\"Herodotus on the Egyptians.\\" Ancient History Encyclopedia.

Historically, souks were held outside cities at locations where incoming caravans stopped and merchants displayed their goods for sale. Souks were established at caravanserai, places where a caravan or caravans arrived and remained for rest and refreshments. Since this might be infrequent, souks often extended beyond buying and selling goods to include major festivals involving various cultural and social activities. Any souk may serve a social function as being a place for people to meet in, in addition to its commercial function.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012 pp 14-15 These souks or bazaars formed networks, linking major cities with each other in which goods, culture, people and information could be exchanged.Hanachi, P. and Yadollah, S., \\"Tabriz Historical Bazaar in the Context of Change,\\" ICOMOS Conference Proceedings, Paris, 2011 Prior to the 10th century, bazaars were situated on the perimeter of the city or just outside the city walls. Along the major trade routes, bazaars were associated with the caravanserai. From around the 10th century, bazaars and market places were gradually integrated within the city limits. The typical bazaar was a covered area where traders could buy and sell with some protection from the elements.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012 pp 14‚Äì15 Over the centuries, the buildings that housed bazaars became larger and more elaborate. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating, purpose-built market; its construction began in 1455. =From the 10th century to modern times= From around the 10th century, as major cities increased in size, the souk or marketplace shifted to the center of urban cities where it spread out along the city streets, typically in a linear pattern.Moosavi, M. S. Bazaar and its Role in the Development of Iranian Traditional Cities [Working Paper], Tabriz Azad University, Iran, 2006 Around this time, permanent souks also became covered marketplaces.Mehdipour, H.R.N, \\"Persian Bazaar and Its Impact on Evolution of Historic Urban Cores: The Case of Isfahan,\\" The Macrotheme Review [A multidisciplinary Journal of Global Macro Trends], Vol. 2, no. 5, 2013, p.13 Kashan Bazaar, Iran, c. 1800 City bazaars occupied a series of alleys along the length of the city, typically stretching from one city gate to a different gate on the other side of the city. The Bazaar of Tabriz, for example, stretches along 1.5 kilometres of street and is the longest vaulted bazaar in the world.Mehdipour, H.R.N, \\"Persian Bazaar and Its Impact on Evolution of Historic Urban Cores: The Case of Isfahan,\\" The Macrotheme Review [A multidisciplinary Journal of Global Macro Trends], Vol. 2, no. 5, 2013, p.14 Moosavi argues that the Middle-Eastern bazaar evolved in a linear pattern, whereas the market places of the West were more centralised.Moosavi, M. S. Bazaar and its Role in the Development of Iranian Traditional Cities [Working Paper], Tabriz Azad University, Iran, 2006 In pre-Islamic Arabia, two types of bazaar existed: permanent urban markets and temporary seasonal markets. The temporary seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce. Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle East in the history of bazaars, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. However, documentary sources point to permanent marketplaces in cities from as early as 550 BCE.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012, pp 4‚Äì5 Nejad has made a detailed study of early bazaars in Iran and identifies two distinct types, based on their place within the economy, namely:Nejad, R.

In the center is a detached building, the upper portion serving as a lodging for slavedealers, and underneath are cells for newly imported slaves. To this is attached a coffee-house, and near to it a half-ruined mosque. Around the three habitable sides of the court runs an open colonnade, supported by wooden columns, and approached by steps at an angle. Under the colonnade are platforms, separated from each other by low railings and benches. Upon these, dealers and customers may be seen during business hours smoking and discussing prices. :Behind these platforms are ranges of small chambers, divided into two compartments by a trellice-work. The habitable part is raised about three feet from the ground; the remainder serves as passage and cooking place. The front portion is generally tenanted by black, and the rear by white slaves. These chambers are exclusively devoted to females. Those to the north and west are destined for second hand negresses or white women ‚Äì that is, for slaves who have been previously purchased and instructed, and are sent to be resold. The hovels to the east are reserved for newly imported negresses, or black and white women of low price. :The platforms are divided from the chambers by a narrow alley, on the wall side of which are benches, where women are exposed for sale. This alley serves as a passage of communication and walk for the brokers, who sell slaves by auction and on commission. In this case, the brokers walk around, followed by the slaves, and announce the price offered. Purchasers, seated on the platforms, then examine, question and bid, as suits their fancy, until at length the woman is sold or withdrawn.\\" =21st century= In the Middle East, the bazaar is considered to be \\"the beating heart of the city and a symbol of Islamic architecture and culture of high significance.\\"Karimi, M., Moradi, E. and Mehr, R., \\"Bazaar, As a Symbol of Culture and the Architecture of Commercial Spaces in Iranian-Islamic Civilization,\\" Today, bazaars are popular sites for tourists and some of these ancient bazaars have been listed as world heritage sites or national monuments on the basis of their historical, cultural or architectural value. The Medina of Fez, Morocco, with its labyrinthine covered market streets was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981.UNESCO, Medina of Fez, https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/170 Al-Madina Souq is part of the ancient city of Aleppo, another UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986.

Types =Seasonal= Cayenne peppers at a Souk in Yemen, the Souk Al Milh A temporary, seasonal souk is held at a set time that might be yearly, monthly or weekly. The oldest souks were set up annually, and were typically general festivals held outside cities. For example, Souk Ukadh was held yearly in pre-Islamic times in an area between Mecca and Ta‚Äôif during the sacred month of Dhu al-Qi'dah. While a busy market, it was more famous for its poetry competitions, judged by prominent poets such as Al-Khansa and Al-Nabigha. An example of an Islamic annual souk is Al Mirbid just outside Basra, also famed for its poetry competitions in addition to its storytelling activities.Nejad, R. M., ‚ÄúSocial bazaar and commercial bazaar: comparative study of spatial role of Iranian bazaar in the historical cities in different socio-economical context,‚Äù 5th International Space Syntax Symposium Proceedings, Netherlands: Techne Press, D., 2005, Temporary souks tended to become known for specific types of produce. For example, Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012, p. 4 Political, economic and social changes have left only the small seasonal souks outside villages and small towns, primarily selling livestock and agricultural products. Weekly markets have continued to function throughout the Arab world. Most of them are named from the day of the week on which they are held. They usually have open spaces specifically designated for their use inside cities. Examples of surviving markets are the Wednesday Market in Amman that specializes in the sale of used products, the Ghazl market held every Friday in Baghdad specializing in pets; the Fina‚Äô Market in Marrakech offers performance acts such as singing, music, acrobats and circus activities. In tribal areas, where seasonal souks operated, neutrality from tribal conflicts was usually declared for the period of operation of a souk to permit the unhampered exchange of surplus goods. Some of the seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce such as Suq Hijr in Bahrain, noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle Eastern market place, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012, pp 4-5 =Permanent= Permanent souks are more commonly occurring, but less renowned as they focus on commercial activity, not entertainment. Until the Umayyad era, permanent souks were merely an open space where merchants would bring in their movable stalls during the day and remove them at night; no one had a right to specific pitch and it was usually first-come first-served. During the Umayyad era the governments started leasing, and then selling, sites to merchants. Merchants then built shops on their sites to store their goods at night. Finally, the area comprising a souk might be roofed over. With its long and narrow alleys, al-Madina Souk is the largest covered historic market in the world, with an approximate length of 13 kilometers. Al-Madina Souk is part of the Ancient City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986. Organization Fes, Morocco Gharipour has pointed out that in spite of the centrality of souks and bazaars in Middle Eastern history, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012, pp 4-5 Souks are traditionally divided into specialized sections dealing in specific types of product, in the case of permanent souks each usually housed in a few narrow streets and named after the product it specializes in such as the gold souk, the fabric souk, the spice souk, the leather souk, the copy souk (for books), etc. This promotes competition among sellers and helps buyers easily compare prices. At the same time the whole assembly is collectively called a souk. Some of the prominent examples are Souk Al-Melh in Sana'a, Manama Souk in Bahrain, Bizouriyya Souk in Damascus, Saray Souk in Baghdad, Khan Al-Zeit in Jerusalem, and Zanqat Al- Niswaan in Alexandria. Though each neighbourhood within the city would have a local Souk selling food and other essentials, the main souk was one of the central structures of a large city, selling durable goods, luxuries and providing services such as money exchange. Workshops where goods for sale are produced (in the case of a merchant selling locally-made products) are typically located away from the souk itself. The souk was a level of municipal administration. The Muhtasib was responsible for supervising business practices and collecting taxes for a given souk while the Arif are the overseers for a specific trade. Shopping at a souk or market place is part of daily life throughout much of the Middle East.\\"Doha's Sprawling Souk Enters the Modern Era, The National [UAE edition}, 25 February, 2011, \\" https://www.thenational.ae/business/travel-and-tourism/doha-s-sprawling-souk- enters-the-modern-age-1.420872; Ramkumar, E.S., \\"Eid Shopping Reaches Crescendo,\\" Arab News, 13 October, 2007, http://www.arabnews.com/node/304533 Prices are commonly set by bargaining, also known as haggling, between buyers and sellers.Islam, S., \\"Perfecting the Haggle,\\" The National, [UAE edition], 27 March, 2010, https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/perfecting-the-haggle- why-it-s-always-worth-walking-away-1.546397  In art and literature ‚Äì Orientalism  During the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered and excavated parts of North Africa and the Levant. These regions now make up what is called the Middle East, but in the past were known as the Orient. Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups ‚Äì the European West and the East or Orient; us and the other. Europeans often saw Orientals as the opposite of Western civilisation; the peoples could be threatening- they were \\"despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational.\\"Nanda, S. and Warms, E.L., Cultural Anthropology, Cengage Learning, 2010, p. 330 At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period. =Subject matter= Many of these works were lavishly illustrated with engravings of every day scenes of Oriental lifestyles, including scenes of market places and market trade.Houston, C., New Worlds Reflected: Travel and Utopia in the Early Modern Period, Routledge, 2016 Artists focused on the exotic beauty of the land ‚Äì the markets, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favorite subject matter. Some of these works were propaganda designed to justify European imperialism in the East, however many artists relied heavily on their everyday experiences for inspiration in their artworks.Meagher, J., \\"Orientalism in Nineteenth-Century Art,\\" [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Essay], Online: http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/euor/hd_euor.htm For example, Charles D'Oyly, who was born in India, published the Antiquities of Dacca featuring a series of 15 engraved plates of Dacca [now Dhaka, Bangladesh] featuring scenes of markets, commerce, buildings and streetscapes. D'Oyly, Charles, Antiquities of Dacca, London, J. Landseer, 1814 as cited in Bonham's Fine Books and Manuscripts Catalogue, 2012, https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20048/lot/2070/ European society generally frowned on nude painting ‚Äì but harems, concubines and slave markets, presented as quasi-documentary works, satisfied European desires for pornographic art. The Oriental female wearing a veil was a particularly tempting subject because she was hidden from view, adding to her mysterious allure.Nanda, S. and Warms, E.L., Cultural Anthropology, Cengage Learning, 2010, pp 330‚Äì331 =Notable Orientalist artists= Notable artists in the Orientalist genre include: Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me Delacroix (1824‚Äì1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803‚Äì1860), Frederic Leighton (1830-1896), Eug√®ne Alexis Girardet 1853-1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827‚Äì1910) who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce. French painter Jean-√âtienne Liotard visited Istanbul in the 17th century and painted pastels of Turkish domestic scenes. British painter John Frederick Lewis who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life. Edwin Lord Weeks was a notable American example of a 19th-century artist and author in the Orientalism genre. His parents were wealthy tea and spice merchants who were able to fund his travels and interest in painting. In 1895 Weeks wrote and illustrated a book of travels titled From the Black Sea through Persia and India. Other notable painters in the Orientalist genre who included scenes of street life and market-based trade in their work are Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me Delacroix (1824‚Äì1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803‚Äì1860), Frederic Leighton (1830‚Äì1896), Eug√®ne Alexis Girardet 1853‚Äì1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827‚Äì1910), who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce.Davies, K., Orientalists: Western Artists in Arabia, the Sahara, Persia, New York, Laynfaroh, 2005; Meagher, J., \\"Orientalism in Nineteenth- Century Art,\\" [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Essay], Online: http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/euor/hd_euor.htm =Orientalist literature= A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.Houston, C., New Worlds Reflected: Travel and Utopia in the Early Modern Period, Routledge, 2016 Many English visitors to the Orient wrote narratives around their travels. British Romantic literature in the Orientalism tradition has its origins in the early eighteenth century, with the first translations of The Arabian Nights (translated into English from the French in 1705‚Äì08). The popularity of this work inspired authors to develop a new genre, the Oriental tale. Samuel Johnson's History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia, (1759) is mid-century example of the genre. Byron's Oriental Tales, is another example of the Romantic Orientalism genre.Kidwai, A.R., Literary Orientalism: A Companion, New Delhi, Viva Books, 2009, Although these works were purportedly non-fiction, they were notoriously unreliable. Many of these accounts provided detailed descriptions of market places, trading and commerce.MacLean, G., The Rise of Oriental Travel: English Visitors to the Ottoman Empire, 1580‚Äì1720, Palgrave, 2004, p. 6 Examples of travel writing include: Les Mysteres de L'Egypte Devoiles by Olympe Audouard published in 1865Audouard, O.

Biography Coetzee was born in District Six, Cape Town, South Africa. Mountain Records describes Coetzee thus: > His distinctive raunchy tenor sound and the untiring commitment to his > cultural roots made him one of the best known jazzmen to come out of South > Africa. He earned the nickname \\"Manenberg\\" after the hugely successful > collaboration with Dollar Brand in the late seventies. Basil toured and > recorded extensively with Brand (Abdullah Ibrahim). Together with Robbie > Jansen they created the unique brass sound of the group The Pacific Express > inspiring many younger cape jazz musicians in Cape Town. He is probably best known for his recording work with Abdullah Ibrahim (previously known as Dollar Brand). Ibrahim recorded his composition \\"Mannenberg\\" with Coetzee ‚Äì it became an enormous hit in the townships and impressed musicians as the recording is reputed to have been made in just one take. Abdullah Ibrahim is quoted by the BBC as saying, \\"Even Basil himself said that in later years he would use that solo as a study exercise. We also use it now in our teaching as a required solo that young musicians have to play.\\" The composition \\"Manenberg\\" became a South African jazz classic, and is also internationally renowned (indeed, a visit to the Cape Town waterfront will still today reward the jazz enthusiast with the \\"Manenberg\\" jazz venue). An article in The Scotsman records that \\"Coetzee developed a soulful, gospel- influenced instrumental voice which had a raw, impassioned urgency at its core. He often explained that his sound was reflection of the life around him, a product of the fact that 'there's a lot of poverty in the townships, and people are frustrated, and my sound is created within that environment.'\\" Coetzee was signed to the Cape Town based Mountain Records label for a large part of his recording career and made his only solo albums for the label. In 1988 he toured Europe, and released the album Sabenza, with Robbie Jansen, Paul Abrahams (bassist) and Jack Momple, who had all left American-influenced jazz in search of their Cape roots. Recorded in one week, this album changed perceptions about local jazz and includes some Cape Jazz jewels. It was followed by the album Monwabisi, Coetzee's second solo project. It was recorded in difficult times for the artist as he sought to establish his name away from previous successful associations. In the period between leaving his former Pacific Express associates and playing only sporadically for Ibrahim, Coetzee and bass player Paul Abrahams worked together as a duo. Many of the works on this album were arranged and written by them. After Abdullah Ibrahim's return to South Africa from exile, Coetzee regularly performed in Ibrahim's various ensembles. The band Sabenza was active on the local scene, and regularly featured bassist Paul Abrahams, guitarist James Kibby, and drummer Vic Higgins. B: was Coetzee's third solo album, released at about the time of his death in March 1998. This album contains some of his best work and includes contributions from players who worked with him for many years. Basil Coetzee died during the night of 11 March 1998, after a long struggle with cancer, survived by five children and six grandchildren. His funeral took place on Saturday 14 March 1998 in Mitchell's Plain, and he is buried in the Garden of Eden in Ottery. Abdullah Ibrahim was one of those who paid tribute to Basil's memory at his funeral, announcing plans for the establishment of a Basil Manenberg Coetzee Music Academy in his memory.\\"Basil Coetzee\\", South African History Online. Coetzee's son, Basil Coetzee, Jr., played saxophone in the service. Albums Basil Coetzee's recording years spanned 1962‚Äì97, playing both tenor saxophone and flute.

Born in Leicester and of Nigerian descent, he was capped four times for England. Dublin started his career as a Centre-Forward with Norwich City Reserves, but made his name at Cambridge United as a centre- forward. He then went on to other clubs which include Manchester United, Coventry City, Millwall, Aston Villa, Leicester City and Celtic. Dublin is also an amateur percussionist, and invented a percussion instrument called \\"The Dube\\". In 2011, he accompanied Ocean Colour Scene in a gig at the University of East Anglia, Norwich. In 2015, he joined the presenting team on the BBC One daytime show Homes Under the Hammer. Club career =Norwich City= While at school in Leicestershire, Dublin played for several Leicestershire youth teams including Wigston Fields and Thurmaston Magpies. Dublin then went on to begin his professional footballing career with Norwich City after leaving school in 1985, but he never made a first-team appearance and was released from the club in 1988. =Cambridge United= In August 1988, he joined Cambridge United on a free transfer, as a centre-back, which had been his position at Norwich City. However, his new club recognised that Dublin had greater potential as a striker. His prolific goalscoring helped United to successive promotions. During the 1988‚Äì89 season, Dublin was then loaned out for a short spell to Barnet. The 1989‚Äì90 season saw Cambridge promoted from the Fourth Division via the play-offs, when Dublin became the first ever scorer in a Wembley play-off final. In the 1990‚Äì91 season, the club were champions of the Third Division, and the club also reached the quarter- final of the FA Cup in both seasons, with Dublin scoring at Arsenal in 1991. In the 1991‚Äì92 season, he played a big part in helping Cambridge to their highest ever finishing position in the football league, by finishing in fifth place in the last ever season of the old Second Division, but when Cambridge failed to win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs Dublin was put up for sale. He has since spoken many times of his affection for Cambridge United. =Manchester United= Having seen Dublin in a cup tie, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signed him for ¬£1 million on 7 August 1992, fighting off competition from Chelsea and Everton. Dublin was something of a surprise purchase for United, after Ferguson had tried to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton but lost out to Blackburn Rovers. He scored in United's fourth Premier League game of the 1992‚Äì93 season, a last minute winner in United's first Premier league victory ‚Äì 1‚Äì0 against Southampton at The Dell. However, on 2 September, he suffered a broken leg against Crystal Palace in a 1‚Äì0 win at Old Trafford, after a tackle by Eric Young, and was out of action for six months. By the time he had recovered, however, United had signed Eric Cantona and the Frenchman was firmly established as first choice strike partner to Mark Hughes. United won the league that season for the first time since 1967, but Dublin failed to make the 10 Premier League appearances required to automatically gain a title winner's medal. However, he was given a medal as a result of special dispensation from the Premier League. In the 1993‚Äì94 season, Dublin regained his fitness, but his first team chances were restricted by the successful partnership of Cantona and Hughes. In December 1993, Ferguson agreed a deal with Everton manager Howard Kendall, that would have seen Dublin moving to Goodison Park, but a member of Everton's board of directors, apparently feeling that Dublin was not worth the money Kendall had offered United, intervened to prevent the transfer going through ‚Äì this dispute sparked Kendall's resignation as manager. Dublin would remain a United player for another nine months, but never managed to claim a regular place in the first team. He managed five league appearances that season, scoring once in a 3‚Äì2 home win over Oldham Athletic in early April, his goal helping secure a vital victory in the title run-in during a spell when United started to drop points and Blackburn Rovers were closing in on them. He also managed a further goal in the Football League Cup second round first leg, as United were beaten 2‚Äì1 by Stoke City at the Victoria Ground. The goal against Oldham was the only competitive goal that Dublin scored for United at Old Trafford. He was left out of the FA Cup winning team, and failed to make enough appearances to merit another Premier League title winners medal, and in September 1994, he was sold to Coventry City for ¬£2 million - a record signing for Coventry City at the time - and also one of the largest fees received by Manchester United. =Coventry City= In four-and-a-half years with Coventry, Dublin established himself as one of the Premier League's top strikers and during the 1997‚Äì98 season won the first of his four full England caps. That season, he equalled the Coventry City record for most goals in a top division season with 23 goals in all competitions. Following Phil Neal's departure in 1995, the arrival of Ron Atkinson and Gordon Strachan would see Dublin fit into an attacking team in the typical Atkinson mould. It included the likes of Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby to add to the already attack minded Peter Ndlovu. The addition of Gary McAllister, following UEFA Euro 1996, should have provided mid-table stability but the team's defensive frailties often undermined Dublin's scoring at the other end. This culminated in possibly one of the greatest escapes in Premier League history in May 1997. Despite having won away to Liverpool (Dublin scoring in the dying seconds) and at home to Chelsea in their previous two games, Coventry City went into the final day second from bottom of the table, needing not only to beat Tottenham Hotspur away from home but also for results elsewhere in the league to go their way for them to escape relegation. Goals from Dublin and Paul Williams gave Coventry a 2‚Äì1 win at White Hart Lane, while both Middlesbrough and Sunderland lost, and Coventry finished one point outside the relegation zone. The following season the Sky Blues improved at home and enjoyed a season of mid table security. Dublin formed an impressive partnership with Darren Huckerby which not only produced some memorable goals but also propelled the Sky Blues to the FA Cup Sixth Round against Sheffield United; a game they narrowly lost in a penalty shoot out. The 1997‚Äì98 season also saw Dublin share elite status as the Premier League's top scorer with Blackburn's Chris Sutton and Liverpool's Michael Owen ‚Äì each Englishman scoring 18 league goals. During this season, Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson tabled a bid which Dublin rejected. He remained at Highfield Road and contributed to Coventry's best finish to date in the Premiership (11th). =Aston Villa= Dublin was controversially excluded from the England 1998 FIFA World Cup squad, despite being the Premier League's joint top-scorer in the 1997‚Äì98 season, alongside Michael Owen and Chris Sutton. However, his exploits at club level were still attracting significant attention and in the autumn of 1998, he chose to move to Aston Villa for ¬£5.75 million. In his first four games for the club, he would score 7 goals including a memorable hat-trick against Southampton in only his second game for the Villa. As a result, he is one of only six players to score in the first four consecutive games for a Premier League club. In December 1999, while playing for Aston Villa against Sheffield Wednesday, he sustained a life-threatening broken neck, as a result of which he permanently has a titanium plate holding three neck vertebrae together. Just days before suffering this injury, it was reported in the News of the World that Dublin would soon be sold by Aston Villa for a fee of around ¬£6 million as the club looked to finance a fall in its share value as a result of manager John Gregory's heavy expenditure on players. Incredibly, the injury did not end Dublin's career and he was back in action three months later. In April 2000, a week after returning to the team, he helped Aston Villa reach their first FA Cup final in 43 years, which they lost 1‚Äì0 against Chelsea, scoring a penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Bolton Wanderers. Having regained his fitness, Dublin remained on the Villa Park payroll until 2002. Faced with competition for a first team place by Juan Pablo √Ångel and Peter Crouch, Dublin spent several weeks on loan at First Division Millwall. In his time there, he scored two goals, against Stockport County, and Grimsby Town in five league matches to help them into the play-offs where despite Dublin's goal in the first leg of the semi final, Millwall lost to Birmingham City 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. Returning to Villa, he found himself again a first-choice striker, partnering Darius Vassell up front. Dublin was sent off at Villa Park for a headbutt on Robbie Savage in the Birmingham derby match, which ended 2‚Äì0 to Birmingham City. =Leicester City= When his contract expired in the summer of 2004, he was given a free transfer. He was signed by Leicester City, who had been relegated from the Premier League to the Championship. In his first season with the club, he scored only four goals in 38 competitive matches. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, Dublin lost his place as the team's main striker, but continued to appear as a defender. His contract at Leicester City was terminated by mutual consent on 30 January 2006. =Celtic= He was snapped up quickly by then Celtic manager Gordon Strachan, to cover for the loss of Chris Sutton, on a contract until the end of the season. At Celtic, Dublin achieved double success, with Scottish League Cup and Scottish Premier League winner's medals. On 19 March 2006, Dublin came on as a sub and scored the final goal as Celtic defeated Dunfermline 3‚Äì0 to win the Scottish League Cup final, and also played enough matches with Celtic to merit a title medal. In the league, he made three league starts and eight substitute appearances for Celtic, scoring once against Kilmarnock on 9 April 2006 in a 4‚Äì1 win at Rugby Park. Despite one or two decent performances for the Parkhead outfit, Dublin was released by manager Gordon Strachan in May 2006. =Norwich City (second spell)= Dublin battling in the air against Tom Kemp in the FA Cup game with Tamworth. On 20 September 2006, Norwich City announced that Dublin had joined them until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. It marked a return, almost 20 years after leaving, for Dublin to the club where he began his career. He made his debut on 23 September 2006 when he came on as substitute against Plymouth Argyle. He scored his first competitive goal in Norwich City colours in a 3‚Äì3 draw against Queens Park Rangers on 14 October 2006 at Loftus Road. Steve Wilson cited Dublin as the main inspiration behind Norwich's 4‚Äì1 FA Cup 3rd Round win at Tamworth, in which the striker scored two goals and set up numerous chances for other teammates. Dublin was an important figure in Norwich securing safety from relegation to League One and the supporters recognised his contribution by voting him in second place in the Norwich City player of the year award, and on 23 May 2007 he ended speculation about his future by signing a new one-year contract at Norwich, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. On 2 September 2007, while working as a pundit on a match between Aston Villa and Chelsea, Dublin said that this season would be his last as a professional footballer, citing the fact that his \\"bones have started to talk to him\\" as the reason, meaning that he did not think his body can handle another season. Hillsborough, 4 May 2008 In the spring of 2008, Dublin was approached by Jimmy Quinn, then manager of Cambridge United, about joining his old club for the 2008‚Äì09 season. However, the player would not change his mind about retiring. He was voted the club's Player of the Year and awarded the Barry Butler trophy on 26 April 2008 in his final season as a footballer, at his penultimate game, and on his final appearance at Carrow Road. Dublin played his final game on 4 May 2008, featuring in Norwich's 4‚Äì1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday in front of 36,208 fans at Hillsborough ‚Äì the highest Championship attendance that season. When he was taken off in the 66th minute, Dublin received a standing ovation from both sets of supporters, players and referee Mark Clattenburg. International career Dublin earned his first cap for England on 11 February 1998, playing the whole 90 minutes in the 2‚Äì0 friendly defeat to Chile at Wembley Stadium. In the run-up to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Dublin played in the King Hassan II International Cup Tournament in May, starting in the 1‚Äì0 win against Morocco, and coming off the bench in 0‚Äì0 draw with Belgium, a game England lost on penalties. Despite showing good form and versatility throughout the season, including finishing joint top scorer in the Premier League with 18 goals, Glenn Hoddle included Les Ferdinand ahead of Dublin in his 22-man squad for the tournament in France. On 18 November, he started in the 2‚Äì0 friendly win against the Czech Republic at Wembley Stadium. This turned out to be Dublin's last cap for his country. He won four caps for England but did not score any goals. After football Since retiring from football, Dublin has worked in the media as a pundit for Sky Sports. As well as appearing on Ford Super Sunday with Richard Keys, Dublin has commentated on a number of games including the UEFA Champions League games with Martin Tyler. He has also been a member of the panel on BBC Radio 5 Live's Fighting Talk. He has also co- presented 606 on BBC Radio 5 Live, Match of the Day 2 and was also a regular on BBC One's Late Kick Off in the East region. He joined Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts on Homes Under the Hammer in 2015. The Dube Away from football, during his spell with Norwich, he invented a percussion instrument called The Dube, a form of caj√≥n. In 2011, he accompanied Ocean Colour Scene during a gig at the University of East Anglia.

The early part of the 20th century saw the increasing urbanisation of black South Africans in mining centres such as the gold mining area around Johannesburg - the Witwatersrand. This led to the development of township slums or ghettos, and out of this hardship came forth new forms of music, marabi and kwela amongst others. Marabi was the name given to a keyboard style (often using cheap pedal organs) that had a musical link to American jazz, ragtime and blues, with roots deep in the African tradition. Early marabi musicians were part of an underground musical culture and were typically not recorded. Indeed, as with early jazz in the USA, the music incurred the displeasure of the establishment. Nonetheless, as with early jazz, the lilting melodies and catchy rhythms of marabi found their way into the sounds of popular dance bands with a distinctively South African style. The sound of marabi was intended to draw people into local bars or \\"shebeens\\" (where illicit drinks like skokiaan were sold), and to get them dancing. \\"Shebeens\\" resemble the American speakeasies of the prohibition era where American Jazz was very popular. Marabi is characterised by a few simple chords repeated in varying vamping patterns that could go on for a long time; repetitive harmonic patterns being typical of traditional African musics. This was the case so people could dance for extended periods of time without having to know the songs well. People were able to pick up the feel and rhythm of the song after a few times through the progression. The most famous of marabi's venues were the shebeens, and the weekend-long slumyard parties. For almost everyone outside ghetto life, however, marabi and its subculture were shunned. Associated with illegality, police raids, sex and a desperately impoverished working class, marabi was thought of as a corrupting menace and for this reason, it is no surprise that no early marabi musicians were recorded. A reflection of this music can be heard in the music of such Cape Jazz performers as Basil Coetzee or Abdullah Ibrahim. The beginnings of broadcast radio intended for black listeners and the growth of an indigenous recording industry helped propel such sounds to immense popularity from the 1930s onward. Such bands produced the first generation of professional black musicians in South Africa. Over the years, marabi developed into early mbaqanga, arguably the most distinctive form of South African music. This has continued to influence South African music since then, from the jazz performers of the post-war years to the more populist township forms of the 1980s and onwards. With the infusion of more traditional influences, marabi has lost much of its link to the style's jazz roots and is now part of the African music culture as opposed to South African Jazz. One of the most notable musical pieces that contain a hint of Marabi is Paul Simon's 1986 epic, Graceland. The Garland Encyclopedia of Music says, \\"Fundamental to much of the musical mix (of Graceland) was the influence of the African-American jazz, introduced into South Africa by transnational record-distribution networks in the 1920s. Most South African jazz musicians could not read scores, so they developed their own jazz flavor, mixing American swing with African melodies. The dynamic blend of african-american structure and African style became the basis for early South African township jazz known as marabi.\\"  Further reading  * * Ballantine, Christopher John, Marabi Nights: Early South African Jazz and Vaudeville, Ravan Press, 1993. * Gwangwa, Jonas; van Aurich, Fulco. \\"The melody of freedom: A reflection on music\\" *  External links  * South African Music: Marabi  References  * Category:South African styles of music ","title":"Marabi"},{"id":"556948","text":"CKNX-TV was a television station owned by CTVglobemedia which served mid- western Ontario, Canada. It was part of the A television network. The station's offices, studios, and transmission facilities were located in Wingham. A bureau in Owen Sound closed down in late 2004.\\"News bureau shut down\\" yourmedia.ca Source: Owen Sound Sun Times 2004-08-24 In February 2009, CTV announced it would not renew CKNX's broadcast licence for the 2009-2010 television season and put the station up for sale. In April 2009, CTV announced a deal to sell the station along with two other sister stations in Windsor and Brandon to Shaw Communications for a dollar. However, the deal was rejected in June. A a result, CKNX closed down as a separate station on August 31, 2009. Its transmitter remains in operation as an analogue rebroadcaster of CFPL-DT in London./A\\\\ Windsor Station to Remain Open, CTVglobemedia press release, July 8, 2009 History CKNX was built by W. T. \\"Doc\\" Cruickshank. It signed on as a CBC Television affiliate on November 18, 1955 and was located in a former high school along with its sister AM radio station CKNX. After going to air, one of their early identification cards displayed the station's mascot, which was a smiling television camera wearing a large cowboy hat. CKNX-TV logo from 1969 On March 8, 1962, the building which accommodated the CKNX radio and television stations caught fire. Although nothing could be salvaged, CKNX-TV was on the air again later that night with the help of nearby stations CFPL-DT, CKVR-DT, CKCO-DT, and CBLT-DT. CKNX operations continued as such (with various temporary offices set up in Wingham) until they purchased new equipment and moved into a new building in 1963. Logo used while as BBS. Used until 1998. In 1964, the station expanded its coverage to Kitchener in response to CKCO-TV's affiliation with CTV. Staffers were required to be more versatile than ever to better compete, giving them well- rounded knowledge for moving up in the industry. For example, the zany host of the noon cartoon program would often become the serious anchor for the 12:30 newscast. =As an independent and The New NX= CKNX disaffiliated from the CBC in 1988 and remained an independent station for another ten years until CHUM Limited purchased the station from Baton Broadcasting. Under the ownership of CHUM, the station joined the NewNet system and was accordingly rebranded The New NX. Logo used while as The New NX, used until 2005. The New NX's news program, NewsNow, drew the lowest viewership of all NewNet stations (82,000) which is not surprising, since it was in the smallest NewNet market. News programming aired on CKNX is simulcast from CFPL in London, however CKNX viewers still receive a separate 11 p.m. news feed (Monday - Friday) which originates from the CFPL studios. =As A-Channel Wingham= On August 2, 2005, CKNX was rebranded \\"A-Channel\\", along with all of the other NewNet Stations. NewsNow at Noon was discontinued a month before the rebrand. On July 12, 2006, CTV owner CTVglobemedia announced plans to purchase A-Channel owner CHUM Ltd. for $C1.7 billion, with plans to divest itself of the A-Channel and Access Alberta stations. Logo used while as A-Channel, used from 2005-2008. On April 9, 2007, it was announced that Rogers Communications filed with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to purchase all of the A-Channel stations, including CKNX, CKX-TV, Access Alberta and several cable channels being put up for sale in the wake of CTVglobemedia's pending acquisition of the CHUM group. On June 8, 2007, the CRTC announced its approval of CTVglobemedia's purchase of CHUM Limited, but added a condition that CTVglobemedia must sell off CHUM's Citytv stations to another buyer while keeping the A-Channel stations (including CKNX), in effect cancelling the planned sale of A-Channel to Rogers Media. All of the CHUM Limited channels (with the exception of Citytv) were taken over by CTVglobemedia on June 22, 2007. On July 26, 2007, CTVglobemedia named Richard Gray the head of news for the A-Channel stations and CKX-TV will report to the CTVgm corporate group, not CTV News, to preserve independent news presentation and management. Gray will oversee the news departments for CKVR, CHRO, CFPL, CKNX, CHWI, CIVI and CKX-TV. =As A Wingham= On August 11, 2008, CKNX and all of the A-Channel stations were renamed \\"A\\".

The Globe and Mail, June 30, 2009. On July 8, 2009, CTV said it would not reconsider its decision to end separate local programming on CKNX. However, it has decided to maintain the Wingham transmitter as a rebroadcaster of CFPL, pending CRTC approval. The same day, CTV announced it would retain its sister station, CHWI in Windsor until at least 2010, based on temporary increases to the Local Programming Improvement Fund. In addition, the CRTC renewed the licences for CKNX, CHWI and CKX, even though CTV had not filed renewals for these stations. As a result, on August 31, CKNX signed off for the last time as a separate station, becoming a full-time repeater of CFPL. CKNX was the eighth and final television station in Canada of the 2000s to become a rebroadcaster since the CTV-owned CBC stations in Saskatchewan and Northern Ontario became rebroadcasters of CBKT in Regina and CBLT in Toronto in October 2002. In addition, Canwest-owned CHCA-TV, an E! station in Red Deer, Alberta, closed down the same day without becoming a rebroadcaster. CTV-owned CKX-TV, a CBC Television affiliate in Brandon, Manitoba followed, closing down operations on October 2 after Bluepoint Investment Corporation reneged on the sale of CKX. Both CTVglobemedia stations (CKX and CKNX) were on-air from 1955 to 2009. =Future of CKNX-TV as a repeater= On June 27, 2016, it was announced that Bell Media filed a proposal with the CRTC to shut down 40 of its television transmitters (all rebroadcasters of other stations), due to maintenance costs, high cable and satellite viewership, and no generation of revenue. CKNX-TV is one of the transmitters to be closed down. This was part of Bell's regular periodic licence renewal process, which began on February 11, 2016. Bell Media explains the rationale for deleting these analog repeaters:https://services.crtc.gc.ca/pub/DocWebBroker/OpenDocument.aspx?AppNo=201600122&_ga=1.139397107.1388147273.1466830064 > \\"We are electing to delete these analog transmitters from the main licence > with which they are associated.

Breveted colonel, Durnford is mainly known for his defeat by the Zulus at the Battle of Isandlwana, which was a disaster for the British Army. Background Durnford was born into a military family at Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, Ireland, on 24 May 1830.Greaves (2011), pp. 165‚Äì167. His father was General Edward William Durnford, also of the Royal Engineers.http://www.rorkesdriftvc.com/isandhlwana/durnford.htm His younger brother, Edward, also served in the British military, as a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Marine Artillery. During his formative years he lived with his uncle in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. In July 1846 Durnford returned to England to enter the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1848 initially serving at Chatham and Scotland. Between 1851 and 1856 he served in Ceylon, stationed at Trincomalee, where he provided distinguished assistance in designing the harbour. In 1853 Durnford was instrumental in saving portions of the harbour defences from destruction by fire. Durnford volunteered for service in the Crimean War but was not accepted. He was transferred in 1856 to Malta as an intermediate posting, but did not see active service either in the Crimea or in the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. He served in Malta as an adjutant until February 1858, when he was promoted to Second Captain and posted back to Chatham and Aldershot in England. Between 1861 and 1864 Durnford commanded No. 27 Field Company, Royal Engineers, at Gibraltar. In 1864, promoted to captain, he was transferred to China, but was invalided back to England while in transit due to heat apoplexy. After his recovery, Durnford spent the next six years at Devonport and Dublin on routine garrison duties. In 1871 he received a posting to South Africa. South African duty On 23 January 1872, he arrived in Cape Town, still never having seen active service. He was, however, promoted to major on 5 July 1872 and lieutenant colonel on 11 December 1873. Of the 16 months following his arrival in the Cape, Durnford spent the greater portion at King William's Town. In a letter to his mother he wrote of the blacks: ‚Ä≥...they are at least honest, chivalrous and hospitable, true to their salt, although only barbarians. They are fine men, very naked and all that sort of thing, but thoroughly good fellows.‚Ä≥ He appears to have adhered to this view throughout the remaining years of his life. He was later stationed at Pietermaritzburg, where he was befriended by Bishop Colenso and he joined Theophilus Shepstone on an expedition to crown King Cetshwayo. Durnford had a close relationship with the bishop's daughter Frances Ellen Colenso. His marriage, though in a poor state, meant that they remained only close friends.J. P. C. Laband, 'Durnford, Anthony William (1830‚Äì1879)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008 accessed 2 Jan 2017 However Ellen later wrote a book in support of his military reputation.B. M. Nicholls, 'Colenso, Harriette Emily (1847‚Äì1932)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 2 Jan 2017 Durnford saw some action during the pursuit of Langalibalele at Bushman's River Pass, where he showed great courage but received two assegai stabs, one in his side, the other in his elbow; severing a nerve thus paralysing his left under-arm and hand for the rest of his life. Durnford managed to shoot two of his assailants with his revolver and to extricate himself. His Natal Carbineers had abandoned him, but his loyal Basuto troopers stood by him. In 1878 Durnford, as the senior Royal Engineer officer in the colony, served on Sir Henry Bulwer's Boundary Commission to investigate the disputed border between the Transvaal and the Zulu Kingdom. Later that year he was given the task of planning the formation of an African auxiliary force which soon became the Natal Native Contingent (NNC). Anglo- Zulu War He was one of the most experienced officers of the Anglo-Zulu War --\\"commanding presence, untiring energy and undoubted powers of leadership\\", he was also apt to be headstrong, and was threatened with loss of command by Lord Chelmsford. Assigned to lead the No. 2 Column of Chelmsford's invasion army, Durnford commanded a mixed force of African troops including the Natal Native Horse and a detachment of the 1st Regiment Natal Native Contingent. On 20 January, Durnford's force was ordered to Rorke's Drift to support Chelmsford's column. That evening, a portion of the No. 2 Column under Durnford arrived at Rorke's drift and camped on the Zulu bank where it remained through the next day. Late on the evening of 21 January, Durnford was ordered to Isandlwana, as was a small detachment of No. 5 Field Company, Royal Engineers, commanded by Lieutenant John Chard, which had arrived on the 19th to repair the pontoons which bridged the Buffalo. Chard rode ahead of his detachment to Isandlwana on the morning of 22 January to clarify his orders, but was sent back to Rorke's Drift with only his wagon and its driver to construct defensive positions for the expected reinforcement company, passing Durnford's column en route in the opposite direction. Around 10:30am on the morning of 22 January, Durnford arrived from Rorke's Drift with five troops of the Natal Native horse and a rocket battery. A Royal Engineer, Durnford was superior in rank to Brevet Lt-Col Henry Pulleine, who had been left in control of the camp. This put the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition would have assumed command. Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel, yet he was still being paid as a major. Durnford did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions, however, and after lunch he quickly decided to take the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp. Durnford's Last Stand Durnford was killed during the resulting battle, and was later criticised for taking men out of the camp thus weakening its defence. His policy though, was in effect to ride to the sound of the guns, \\"and attack the Zulu wherever they appeared\\", and was well respected by his native Basutos. It must be added, moreover, that the actions of Durnford and his command effectively halted the left horn of the Zulu army until their cartridge boxes began to run dry. This was no small accomplishment considering the Left Horn included the inGobamakhosi regiment, \\"The Benders of the Kings\\". Their ammunition supply expended, Durnford and his troopers fought their way back to the \\"saddle\\" that separated the wagon park from the rest of the camp. In one last valiant effort, Durnford, after ordering his native troopers to escape, perished with a mixed group of colonial volunteers, members of the Natal Mounted Police and infantrymen of the 24th Foot after they had held apart the horns of the Zulu army long enough to enable many survivors to escape. Durnford's body was later found lying near a wagon, surrounded by the bodies of his men. Among the causes of the disaster were the ill-defined relationship between Durnford and Pulleine, brought about by failures of Lord Chelmsford's command and control, a lack of good intelligence on the size and location of Zulu forces which resulted in Chelmsford splitting his force and, most decidedly, Chelmsford's decision not to fortify the camp (which was in direct violation of his own standing pre-campaign orders). Popular culture In the 1979 film Zulu Dawn, which depicted the battle of Isandlwana, Durnford was portrayed by Burt Lancaster.

If we want to talk about the radiant flux emitted by a surface, we speak of radiant exitance. =Spectral irradiance= Spectral irradiance in frequency of a surface, denoted Ee,ŒΩ, is defined as :E_{\\\\mathrm{e}, u} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E_\\\\mathrm{e}}{\\\\partial u}, where ŒΩ is the frequency. Spectral irradiance in wavelength of a surface, denoted Ee,Œª, is defined as :E_{\\\\mathrm{e},\\\\lambda} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E_\\\\mathrm{e}}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda}, where Œª is the wavelength. Property Irradiance of a surface is also, according to the definition of radiant flux, equal to the time-average of the component of the Poynting vector perpendicular to the surface: :E_\\\\mathrm{e} = \\\\langle\\\\mathbf{S}\\\\rangle \\\\cos \\\\alpha, where * is the time-average; *S is the Poynting vector; *Œ± is the angle between a unit vector normal to the surface and S. For a propagating sinusoidal linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave, the Poynting vector always points to the direction of propagation while oscillating in magnitude. The irradiance of a surface is then given by :E_\\\\mathrm{e} = \\\\frac{n}{2 \\\\mu_0 \\\\mathrm{c}} E_\\\\mathrm{m}^2 \\\\cos \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{n \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\mathrm{c}}{2} E_\\\\mathrm{m}^2 \\\\cos \\\\alpha, where *Em is the amplitude of the wave's electric field; *n is the refractive index of the medium of propagation; *c is the speed of light in vacuum; *Œº0 is the vacuum permeability; *Œµ0 is the vacuum permittivity. This formula assumes that the magnetic susceptibility is negligible, i.e. that Œºr ‚âà 1 where Œºr is the magnetic permeability of the propagation medium. This assumption is typically valid in transparent media in the optical frequency range. Solar energy The global irradiance on a horizontal surface on Earth consists of the direct irradiance Ee,dir and diffuse irradiance Ee,diff. On a tilted plane, there is another irradiance component, Ee,refl, which is the component that is reflected from the ground. The average ground reflection is about 20% of the global irradiance. Hence, the irradiance Ee on a tilted plane consists of three components: :E_\\\\mathrm{e} = E_{\\\\mathrm{e},\\\\mathrm{dir}} + E_{\\\\mathrm{e},\\\\mathrm{diff}} + E_{\\\\mathrm{e},\\\\mathrm{refl}}. The integral of solar irradiance over a time period is called \\"solar exposure\\" or \\"insolation\\".

Generally, the implication is that chickenhawks lack the moral character to participate in war themselves, preferring to ask others to support, fight, and perhaps die in an armed conflict. Origin of the term In political usage, chickenhawk is a compound of chicken (meaning coward) and hawk (meaning someone who advocates war, first used to describe \\"War Hawks\\" in the War of 1812). On one episode of the American television show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In that aired in 1970, Dan Rowan made the following joke:Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In :\\"On the Vietnam issue, I have a friend who says he's a chickenhawk. He wants us to fight on to victory, but to do it without him.\\" The 1983 bestselling book Chickenhawk was a memoir by Robert Mason about his service in the Vietnam War, in which he was a helicopter pilot. Mason used the word as a compound oxymoron to describe both his fear of combat (\\"chicken\\") and his attraction to it (\\"hawk\\"), a slightly different use of the term which nonetheless might have inspired the current usage.\\"Chicken Hawk\\" entry from Word Spy Previously, the term war wimp was sometimes used, coined during the Vietnam War by Congressman Andrew Jacobs, a Marine veteran of the Korean War. Jacobs defined a war wimp as \\"someone who is all too willing to send others to war, but never got 'round to going himself\\". Donald Trump has been used as a modern example of a chickenhawk.

It stars Aamir Khan, Jackie Shroff and Urmila Matondkar. The film was A. R. Rahman's debut Hindi film with an original score and soundtrack, as his previous Hindi releases were dubbed versions of his Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu films. The film was a major box office success and received critical acclaim, and was screened at the mainstream section of the International Film Festival of India. The film was reported to have inspired the 2004 movie Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! The film won seven Filmfare awards that year. They were: Best actor in supporting role (Jackie Shroff), Best choreography (Ahmed Khan), Best Costume Designing (Manish Malhotra), Best Story (Ram Gopal Varma), Best Music (A. R. Rahman), the RD Burman Award (Mehboob), and a Special Jury Award (Asha Bhosle), for \\"Tanha Tanha\\".  Plot  A street-toughened orphan by the name of Munna (Aamir Khan) is befriended by some kind folks, whose effervescent daughter Mili (Urmila Matondkar) soon grows to be his best buddy. Both gravitate toward the Mumbai movie industry. While Mili finds occupation as a movie extra, Munna earns his livelihood selling movie tickets in the black market. Mili has ambitions of becoming an actress. Fortune glances her way when she dances her way into a movie star's attention. This actor, Raj Kamal (Jackie Shroff), arranges for her to be auditioned for the heroine's role in his upcoming movie called Rangeela. Mili's shortcomings amount to distractions, but thanks in no small way to Munna and Raj, she lands the role. Raj and Munna both fall for Mili, but Mili is too busy making the movie to notice any of this. She starts spending a lot of time with Raj during the filming. Munna tries many times to tell Mili that he loves her, but he is unable to, or Raj gets in the way. Eventually, feeling inferior, Munna decides to leave Mili to Raj, who can give her a better life than he can. The matter is not resolved though, as Mili hears of this on the film's opening night. She asks Raj to help her find Munna, which he does after realizing that Mili seems to love Munna and not him. Mili stops Munna midway, misunderstandings get cleared up and the lovers unite.  Cast  * Aamir Khan as Munna * Jackie Shroff as Raj Kamal * Urmila Matondkar as Mili Joshi * Gulshan Grover as Steven Kapoor * Avtar Gill as P.C. * Reema Lagoo as Mrs. Joshi (Mili's mother) * Achyut Potdar as Mr. Joshi (Mili's father) * Rajesh Joshi as Pakya * Neeraj Vora as Drunk party guest (bluffer) * Rajeev Mehta as Restaurant Steward * Nitin Chandrakant Desai * Ram Mohan as Make-Up Dada * Shammi as Gulbadan's mother * Tarun as Tough guy at the shooting * Suman as Motilal * Himanshu * Aditya Narayan as himself (singing in the song \\"Rangeela Re\\") * Saroj Khan as herself (choreographer) * Remo D'Souza as a background dancer in title song * Shefali Chhaya as Gulbadan (special appearance) * Madhur Bhandarkar in a special appearance  Reception  Rangeela opened to critical acclaim and was declared a ‚ÄúBlockbuster‚Äù at the box office, grossing 334 million. It was also the fourth biggest grosser of 1995. Urmila Matondkar became an overnight sensation and a super star overnight. Her fame & star status was bolstered by hits like Tanha Tanha and Rangeela Re. Her designer Manish Malhotra also received instant fame. The movie proved to be a turning point for Aamir's career, whose chemistry with Urmila was also appreciated. The choreography of Rangeela also deserves a special mention. The amazing dance sequences led by choreographers Ahmed Khan and Saroj Khan were considered classic and appealing. Rangeela's music was also highly successful that helped the film to achieve victory at the box office.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack featured 7 songs composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Mehboob and an instrumental theme song. The audio was released in September 1995 by Rahman's mother Kareema and the soundtrack proved immensely popular upon release. It is listed in almost all lists of best Bollywood soundtracks. The soundtrack fetched Rahman two filmfare awards, Filmfare Best Music Director Award and Filmfare RD Burman Award for New Music Talent. Mehboob got two nominations for Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist, for the tracks \\"Kya Kare\\" and \\"Tanha Tanha\\". Shweta Shetty and Kavita Krishnamurthy were nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for their respective tracks. Asha Bhosle, like her sister Lata Mangeshkar, had long retired from accepting playback singer awards, but she received the Filmfare Special Award that year for her rendition of the song \\"Tanha Tanha\\". The song \\"Yaaro Sun Lo Zara\\" was originally composed for a Telugu film Super Police as \\"Baabu Love Cheyyara\\". The soundtrack was also released in Tamil, with title Rangeela itself and lyrics penned by Vairamuthu. However, the reused track \\"Yaaro Sun Lo Zara\\" was not included in the Tamil version. The soundtrack rights are now acquired by Tips Music Company. = Hindi = = Tamil (dubbed version) = = Telugu (dubbed version) =  Trivia  * The name 'Rangeela' was based on the character of Munna by Aamir Khan. But it was Urmila Matondkar who became synonymous after the success of the film. She would often be termed by the media as 'Rangeeli' in publications and in popular culture. * Urmila Matondkar inspired Ram Gopal Verma to make a dance/music based love story. He stopped trying to rope in Madhuri/Sridevi for some other script of his,Instead started Rangeela with Urmila after getting impressed with her dancing skills on sets of Gaayam(1993 Telugu film) * To get into the role of a Mumbaiya Tapori, Aamir Khan actually spent some of his time with Real Taporis in the real slums of Mumbai. Aamir worked on his diction, dialogue delivery and body language to portray the character convincingly. * Ram Gopal Varma was apparently not happy with Saroj Khan's choreography of 'Tanha Tanha'. So he appointed Ahmed Khan to choreograph rest of the songs. However, its another fact that the choreography of Saroj Khan in 'Tanha Tanha' became the talk of the town and earned her widespread acclaim. * The title credits of the film that features the legendary actors and actresses of Indian Cinema were especially put on display as a token of love from Ram Gopal Varma to the Industry. In his words, Rangeela was a tribute dedicated to the beauty of Indian Cinema. * Rangeela remains RGV's only successful light hearted film that consisted of romance, music and comedy. After that he shifted his focus to thriller and gangster films. Although he attempted to make another light hearted film Mast in 1999. That film could not replicate the success of Rangeela. * Aamir Khan accepted in an interview later that he did not like the music when he first heard it and had not much expectation out of it. Even Asha Bhosle whose career also got a boost with this film did not like the songs much when narrated to her for the first time. * Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar appears in a cameo of an Assistant Director to Steven Kapoor played by Gulshan Grover. *According to popular public opinion, it has been widely reported that actor Aamir Khan stopped attending award functions after he did not win the Best Actor Award for his performance in Rangeela. On the contrary, it was Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander for which Aamir lost the award to Anil Kapoor for Beta which led to the disappointment of the former after which he boycotted the award functions.  Cultural significance  Rangeela is considered to be a cult classic in history of Bollywood. The impact of it was so huge that the film was reported to have inspired the 2004 movie Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!. The 2010 film Break Ke Baad is also loosely based on the storyline of 'Rangeela'. Despite the film's huge success, It was still regarded as a film ahead of its time as the films made during the early 1990s had dated plots and storylines. Shekhar Kapur called it 'The film of the 21st Century with great music and visuals' at the screening of the film. The presentation of Urmila Matondkar in the film became the talk of the town as it re-invented the image of the Bollywood Heroine. Aamir Khan played an unusual character of a Mumbaiya Tapori in the early stages of his career and that proved to be the milestone for him. A R Rahman's music of the film became such a rage that it topped the charts for almost a decade. The songs still remain popular as they have a fresh feel. The film established careers of so many technicians and the people who worked behind the camera.

No original examples are known to survive Steiff is a German-based plush toy company. It was founded in 1880 by Margarete Steiff, a seamstress. The toys began as elephants, and were originally a design Steiff found in a magazine and sold as pincushions to her customers. However, children began playing with them, and in the years following she went on to design many other animal-themed toys for children, such as dogs, cats and pigs. She designed and made most of the prototypes herself. Steiff's nephew Richard joined in 1897 and gave the company an enormous boost by creating stuffed animals from drawings made at the zoo. A 3000 piece order was placed in 1903 by a buyer in America after the \\"Teddy\\" bear craze began showing a cartoon with President Roosevelt and a young cub. By 1907, Steiff manufactured 974,000 bears, and has been increasing its output ever since. Description The Steiff company motto, as styled by Margarete Steiff, is \\"Only the best is good enough for children\\". Steiff products are subject to meticulous testing and inspection. They are required to be highly flame resistant and, among other things, smaller pieces such as eyes must be able to resist considerable tension, wear and tear, etc. The most common materials used in Steiff toys are alpaca, felt, mohair, and woven plush. Eyes are generally made of wood or glass, and the stuffing is commonly wood shavings or polyester fibers. A large amount of the work is done by hand, from design sketches to airbrushed paint. The final touch on any Steiff toy is the trademark \\"button in ear\\" (assuming the animal has one; in any case they will find a spot for it). The iconic \\"button in ear\\" tag was devised by Margarete's nephew Franz in 1904, to keep counterfeits from being passed off as authentic Steiff toys. It is made of metal. The tag originally had the symbol of an elephant, which was later replaced by the name \\"Steiff\\". The button is still used to distinguish Steiff toys from fakes.http://www.steiff.deThe Steiff Collection Some special toys have both the elephant and the name.

It was founded in 1927 as University College Hull. The main university campus is located in Hull and is home to the Hull York Medical School, a joint initiative with the University of York. Students are served by Hull University Union. The first chancellor of the university was Lord Middleton (1954‚Äì1969), followed by Lord Cohen (1970‚Äì1977), Lord Wilberforce (1978‚Äì1994), and Lord Armstrong (1994‚Äì2006). Virginia Bottomley (Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone) was installed as the current chancellor in April 2006. History =University College= thumbright uprightThomas Ferens (1847‚Äì1930), the major benefactor financing the foundation of the University College of Hull The Venn Building ‚ÄòMoving Matter‚Äô by Joseph Hillier The foundation stone of University College Hull, then an external college of the University of London, was laid in 1927 by Prince Albert, the Duke of York (who later became king as George VI).Bamford, plate facing p. 23 The college was built on land donated by Hull City Council and by two local benefactors, Thomas Ferens and G F Grant. A year later the first 14 departments, in pure sciences and the arts, opened with 39 students. The college at that time consisted of one building, now named the Venn building (after the mathematician John Venn, who was born in Hull). The building now houses the administrative centre of the university. Other early buildings include the Cohen Building, which originally housed the college library, and Staff House, now named Canham Turner building, built in 1948 as the Students' Union. Another early structure was the Chemistry Building, built in 1953. With the rapid expansion of student numbers which took place in the 1950s many many academic departments were housed in temporary buildings, colloquially known as 'huts', which gave the campus the feel of an 'academic army camp'.Bamford, pp, 222‚Äì234 Though many of the older buildings on Hull's campus are of red brick it is not a redbrick university in the strictest sense of the term, as it was not founded as part of the civic university movement of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. Hull, with its origins in the 1920s, has been categorised as a 'younger civic university' (also referred to as a \\"Whitetile university\\") and it is placed between the 'redbricks' and the 'plateglass universities' founded in the 1960s.Beloff, Michael (1970) The Plateglass Universities, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, p. 19. The first principal of the college was Arthur E. Morgan (1926‚Äì1935), the second was John H Nicholson (1935‚Äì1954), who also served as the university's first vice-chancellor when the college was granted university status (1954‚Äì1956).Bamford, pp. 23‚Äì27, 68‚Äì69 Coat of arms The university coat of arms was designed by Sir Algernon Tudor-Craig in 1928. The symbols are the torch for learning, the rose for Yorkshire, the ducal coronet from the arms of the City of Hull, the fleur-de-lys for Lincolnshire and the dove, symbolising peace, from the arms of Thomas Ferens. These symbols were later reused to create the current university logo. The motto, Lampada Ferens (Bearing the Torch), incorporates the name of the university's founding father within a Latin pun.Bamford, p. 47 =Royal charter= The college gained its royal charter on 6 September 1954. This empowered it to award degrees of its own, making it the 3rd university in Yorkshire and the 14th in England. The twenty six years between the formation of the university college and the awarding of the charter were the shortest such period in the history of university formation in England up to that time.Bamford, pp. 150‚Äì151 Within a year of the charter being granted applications to study at the new university had doubled, and in 1956 student numbers topped 1,000 for the first time. =The mace= The academic authority and autonomy of the university is symbolically embodied in the ceremonial mace. Made of gilt silver, and incorporating devices from the Hull University coat of arms, the mace was presented to the university in December 1956 by the Lord Mayor of Hull. As a gift from the city it also reflects the close relationship between \\"town and gown\\" existing in Hull. The mace is carried in procession and displayed at all major university ceremonies. =Expansion in the 1950s and 1960s= Brynmor Jones Library The period of rapid expansion of Hull University coincided with the vice- chancellorship of Sir Brynmor Jones (1956‚Äì1972), during whose time in office student numbers quadrupled. The Brynmor Jones Library, which houses more than a million volumes, was constructed in two phases: the first phase was fully completed in 1959, with a tower block extension officially opened in 1970. During the 1950s and 1960s a considerable number of academic buildings were built, including the Larkin and Wilberforce Buildings (originally given other names). The 'Martin Plan' of 1967, Sir Leslie Martin was the university architect, envisaged a campus with its tallest buildings in the centre surrounded by buildings diminishing in height towards the perimeter. In the course of the 1960s most of the departments housed in temporary structures were moved into new purpose-built premises.Bamford, pp, 222‚Äì246 However, Biochemistry was still partially located in a 'hut' to the rear of the Venn building into the early 1980s. This early phase of expansion through building ended in 1974, after this year there was to be no further academic building construction on the campus until 1996. However, student numbers doubled in this period, with the university becoming highly efficient in using its existing building stock. =Liquid crystal technology= In 1972 George Gray and Ken Harrison created room-temperature stable liquid crystals in the university chemistry laboratories, which were an immediate success in the electronics industry and consumer products. This led to Hull becoming the first university to be awarded the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement for the joint-development of the long-lasting materials that made liquid crystal displays possible. =Expansion in the 21st century= In 2000 the university bought the site of University College Scarborough on Filey Road, Scarborough, plus two linked buildings on the same road. This became the University of Hull Scarborough Campus. A further significant expansion took place in 2003, when the buildings of the former Humberside University campus, which were situated immediately adjacent to Hull University's main campus, were purchased. The acquisition increased the size of the Cottingham Road campus by more than a third. It was the largest single act of expansion in the history of the university. Hull University fully occupied the newly acquired premises in the 2005 academic year; the area becoming the university's West Campus. The site now houses the Hull York Medical School and the relocated business school, which is located in three of the most prominent buildings ‚Äì Wharfe, Derwent and Esk. In 2012, the University began the ambitious refurbishment of the Brynmor Jones Library, a ¬£28 million project which will transform the 7 storey former workplace of Philip Larkin, into a learning hub suitable for students for years to come. The project was completed in 2015. =Hull History Centre= The Hull History Centre, which opened in 2010, is located in a new building on Worship Street in Hull city centre. It unites the holdings of Hull City Library's Local Studies collections and Hull University's archives and is run in partnership between the City Library and University Library. =City of Culture 2017= Graduates from a ceremony at the University of Hull gather outside Hull City Hall under the installation Blade, part of the Hull UK City of Culture 2017 celebrations The University was a principal partner of the City's bid to become UK City of Culture in 2017. As well as being involved in the planning and preparation of the bid, the University and its staff and students have been involved in many of the events of the year. For example, during the initial three-month season, Hull Maritime Museum displayed a multimedia installation depicting a Bowhead whale The installation was designed by students from Hull School of Art and Design with music by students from Hull University. The opening event of the whole year, from 1‚Äì7 January, included a multimedia projection called Arrivals and Departures which was greatly influenced by the work of Dr Nick Evans on migration patterns into and through Hull. The installation was projected onto The Deep using stop-frame animation, image and sound. Campuses The main campus is located in a residential district of North Hull on Cottingham Road. The University had a smaller campus in Scarborough on the North Yorkshire coast. Hull University is a campus university; though situated in a city, its main campus is in a suburban rather than urban district. The main campus occupies a single, clearly defined site and is self-contained in regard to catering and entertainment for students and staff. Most of the major features of the campus are described in the 'history' section above; in addition, the campus has a large Students' Union building, which is often described as one of the finest in the country, and extensive playing fields and other sports facilities. The large village of Cottingham on Hull's north-western outskirts houses some of the university-owned student accommodation. =University College Scarborough= University of Hull: Scarborough Campus was a satellite campus of the university located in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, attended by approximately 2,000 students. Formerly a higher education institution offering BSc and BA degrees, the building was acquired by the University of Hull in 2000, offering Education courses, particularly at a primary level, as well as courses in Marine Biology, Digital Media, Music Technology Theatre Studies, Tourism Management, and a number of Business and English courses. Scarborough ran somewhat independently of the main campus in Hull, with its own branch of the Hull University Union. Graduation ceremonies took place within Scarborough's historic Spa Complex. The campus also contained basic amenities for study, such as computer labs, performance studios for students of Theatre and Dance related courses as well as dedicated music suites in the \\"Filey Road Studios\\" building opposite the campus. In April 2014, the University released a statement that Scarborough Campus was \\"not sustainable in the medium to long term\\", and in June held a public consultation outlining the future of the campus with a new academic model in mind. In March 2015, it was revealed that the Hull College Group were the University's \\"preferred partners for taking forward the Scarborough Campus\\". The college returned to its former name, \\"University College Scarborough\\" and became part of the Hull College group, but still hosts programmes from both Hull College and the University of Hull.

The University Union was voted Students' Union of the Year in July 2012. The student union building comprises an on- site nightclub as well as a number of bars and catering outlets. The building also houses a shop, a Waterstones book shop, advice centre, and the university-run careers service. There is a monthly student newspaper called The Hullfire, an online television station called Hullfire TV and a student radio station which broadcasts from the union building called JAM Radio which relaunched in 2017. =Student accommodation= The University has three main halls of residence on campus: * Taylor Court is located next to the Wilberforce building and houses 288 students in en-suite rooms with shared kitchens. * The Courtyard opened in 2016 and is situated next to the Student Union, it houses 562 students in en-suite rooms as well as some rooftop apartments. * Westfield Court partially opened in 2018, with a full opening in 2019 on the site of the former medical school. It houses a total of 1462 students in a mix of single and cluster flats. In the recent past there were additional halls of residence in Cottingham at The Lawns: seven halls which could hold around 1,000 students. In March 2019 it was announced that The Lawns would close. Also Cottingham contained Needler Hall which closed in 2016, Thwaite Hall which closed in 2017 and Cleminson Hall (located adjacent to Thwaite Hall) which closed in 2004. Also, on-campus accommodation was previously available in Loten Hall (now known as the Loten Building). Student housing is based primarily in the terraced streets around the university campus itself, as well as around the Newland Avenue and Beverley Road areas of the city.

The award was made to companies winning an annual competition (organised regionally) based on a judgement of the technical and market viability of research or technology development proposals; in essence the award represented seed-corn funding for innovative developments that had some market potential. The scheme was generally considered to be very successful. In 2002 the scheme was changed from a competition to an award to any applicant who met minimum criteria. This led to several regions exhausting their budget. In 2005 the scheme was shut down and replaced with the Grant for Research and Development which was again a regional competition.

Seri Thai were an important source of military intelligence for the Allies in the region. Background In the aftermath of the Japanese invasion of Thailand on 7‚Äì8 December 1941, the regime of Plaek Phibunsongkhram (Phibun) declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States on 25 January 1942. Seni Pramoj, the Thai ambassador in Washington, refused to deliver the declaration to the United States government. Accordingly, the United States refrained from declaring war on Thailand. Seni, a conservative aristocrat whose anti-Japanese credentials were well established, organized the Free Thai Movement with American assistance, recruiting Thai students in the United States to work with the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The OSS trained Thai personnel for underground activities, and units were readied to infiltrate Thailand. By the end of the war, more than 50,000 Thai had been trained and armed to resist the Japanese by Free Thai members who had been parachuted into the country. World War II and Japanese occupation Phibun's alliance with Japan during the early years of war was initially popular. The Royal Thai Army joined Japan's Burma Campaign with the goal of recovering their historical claims to part of the Shan states, previously surrendered to the Burmese Empire in the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese wars and subsequently annexed by the British following the Third Anglo-Burmese War. They gained the return of the four northernmost Malay states lost in the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, and with Japanese mediation in the Franco‚ÄìThai war they also recovered territory lost in the Franco- Siamese War of 1893. operations in China. However, Japan had stationed 150,000 troops on Thai soil, and as the war dragged on, the Japanese increasingly treated Thailand as a conquered country rather than an ally. Although the United States had not officially declared war, on 26 December 1942, US Tenth Army Air Force bombers based in India launched the first major bombing raid, which damaged targets in Bangkok and elsewhere and caused several thousand casualties. Public opinion, and even more importantly the sympathies of the civilian political elite, moved perceptibly against Phibun's alliance with Japan. =Pridi and the civilian regime, 1944‚Äì1947= In June 1944, Phibun was forced out of office and replaced by the first predominantly civilian government since the 1932 coup. Allied bombing raids continued, and a B-29 raid on Bangkok destroyed the two key power plants on 14 April 1945, leaving the city without power and water.Stearn, Allies attack Throughout the bombing campaign, the Seri Thai network was effective in broadcasting weather reports to the Allied air forces and in rescuing downed Allied airmen. The new government was headed by Khuang Aphaiwong, a civilian linked politically with conservatives such as Seni. The most influential figure in the regime, however, was Pridi Banomyong (who was serving as Regent of Thailand), whose anti-Japanese views were increasingly attractive to the Thais. In the last year of the war, Allied agents were tacitly given free access by Bangkok. As the war came to an end, Thailand repudiated its wartime agreements with Japan. Unfortunately, the civilian leaders were unable to achieve unity. After falling-out with Pridi, Khuang was replaced as prime minister by the regent's nominee, Seni, who had returned to Thailand from his post as leader of the Free Thai movement in Washington. The scramble for power among factions in late 1945 created political divisions among the civilian leaders that destroyed their potential for making a common stand against the resurgent political force of the Thai military in the immediate postwar years. Postwar accommodations with the Allies also weakened the civilian government. As a result of the contributions made to the Allied war efforts by the Free Thai Movement, the United States, which unlike other Allied countries had never officially been at war with Thailand, refrained from dealing with Thailand as an enemy country in postwar peace negotiations. Before signing a peace treaty, however, the United Kingdom demanded war reparations in the form of rice shipments to Malaya, and France refused to permit admission of Thailand to the United Nations (UN) until the Indochinese areas regained by the Thais during the war were returned to France. The Soviet Union insisted on the repeal of Thailand's anti-communist legislation.

He is best known for creating the series character Professor Craig Kennedy, sometimes called \\"The American Sherlock Holmes\\", and Kennedy's Dr. Watson-like sidekick Walter Jameson, a newspaper reporter, in 18 detective novels. The bulk of Reeve's fame is based on the 82 Craig Kennedy stories, published in Cosmopolitan magazine between 1910 and 1918. These were collected in book form; with the third collection, the short stories were stitched together into pseudo-novels. The 12-volume Craig Kennedy Stories were released in 1918; it reissued Reeve's books-to-date as a matched set. Biography Born in Brooklyn, Reeve graduated from Princeton and attended New York Law School. He worked as an editor and journalist before Craig Kennedy propelled him to national fame in 1911. Raised in Brooklyn, he lived most of his professional life at various addresses near the Long Island Sound. In 1932, he moved to Trenton to be nearer his alma mater, Princeton. He died in Trenton in 1936. Starting with The Exploits of Elaine (1914), Reeve began authoring screenplays. His film career reached its peak in 1919-20, when his name appeared on seven films, most of them serials, three of them starring Harry Houdini. After that‚Äîprobably because of the film industry's migration to Hollywood and Reeve's desire to remain in the east‚ÄîReeve worked more sporadically in film. His career is marked by fiction originally published in newspapers, and a variety of magazines including Boys' Life, Country Gentleman, and Everybody's. Eventually, he was found only in pulps like Detective Fiction Weekly and Detective Story Magazine. In 1927, Reeve entered into a contract (with John S. Lopez) to write a series of film scenarios for notorious millionaire-murderer, Harry K. Thaw, on the subject of fake spiritualists. The deal resulted in a lawsuit when Thaw refused to pay. In late 1928, Reeve declared bankruptcy. In the 1930s, Reeve rejuvenated his career by becoming an anti-rackets crusader. He hosted a national radio show from July 1930 to March 1931, published a history of the rackets titled The Golden Age of Crime, and the focus of his Craig Kennedy stories completed Reeve's transition from \\"scientific detective\\" work to a racket-busting milieu. During his career, Reeve covered many celebrated crime cases for various newspapers, including the murder of William Desmond Taylor in 1922, and the trial of Lindbergh baby kidnapper, Bruno Hauptmann, who was executed in 1936.

Born in Paris, he is of one half Hungarian Protestant, one quarter Greek Jewish, and one quarter French Catholic origin. Mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine from 1983 to 2002, he was Minister of the Budget under Prime Minister √âdouard Balladur (1993‚Äì1995) during Fran√ßois Mitterrand's second term. During Jacques Chirac's second presidential term he served as Minister of the Interior and as Minister of Finances. He was the leader of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party from 2004 to 2007. He won the 2007 French presidential election by a 53.1% to 46.9% margin against Socialist S√©gol√®ne Royal. During his term, he faced the late-2000s financial crisis (causing a recession, the European sovereign debt crisis), the Russo-Georgian War (for which he negotiated a ceasefire) and the Arab Spring (especially in Tunisia, Libya, and Syria). He initiated the reform of French universities (2007) and the pension reform (2010). He married Italian-French singer-songwriter Carla Bruni in 2008 at the √âlys√©e Palace in Paris. In the 2012 election, Fran√ßois Hollande, candidate of the Socialist Party, defeated Sarkozy by a 3.2% margin. After leaving the presidential office, Sarkozy vowed to retire from public life before coming back in 2014, being subsequently reelected as UMP leader (renamed The Republicans in 2015). Being defeated at the Republican presidential primary in 2016, he retired from public life. He has been charged with corruption by French prosecutors in two cases, notably concerning the alleged Libyan interference in the 2007 French elections.  Personal life  = Family background = Sarkozy was born in Paris, and is the son of P√°l Istv√°n Ern≈ë S√°rk√∂zy de Nagy-B√≥csa (; ‚Äîin some sources Nagy-B√≥csay S√°rk√∂zy P√°l Istv√°n Ern≈ë), (born 5 May 1928), a Protestant Hungarian aristocrat, and Andr√©e Jeanne \\"Dadu\\" Mallah (12 October 1925 ‚Äì 12 December 2017), whose Greek Jewish father converted to Catholicism to marry Sarkozy's French Catholic maternal grandmother. They were married in the Saint-Fran√ßois-de-Sales church, 17th arrondissement of Paris, on 8 February 1950, and divorced in 1959. =Early life= During Sarkozy's childhood, his father founded his own advertising agency and became wealthy. The family lived in a mansion owned by Sarkozy's maternal grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. The family later moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine, one of the wealthiest communes of the √éle-de-France r√©gion immediately west of Paris. According to Sarkozy, his staunchly Gaullist grandfather was more of an influence on him than his father, whom he rarely saw. Sarkozy was raised Catholic. Sarkozy said that being abandoned by his father shaped much of who he is today. He also has said that, in his early years, he felt inferior in relation to his wealthier and taller classmates.Un pouvoir nomm√© d√©sir, Catherine Nay, 2007 \\"What made me who I am now is the sum of all the humiliations suffered during childhood\\", he said later.Un pouvoir nomm√© d√©sir, Catherine Nay, 2007 =Education= Sarkozy was enrolled in the Lyc√©e Chaptal, a well regarded public middle and high school in Paris' 8th arrondissement, where he failed his sixi√®me. His family then sent him to the Cours Saint-Louis de Monceau, a private Catholic school in the 17th arrondissement, where he was reportedly a mediocre student,Un pouvoir nomm√© d√©sir, Catherine Nay, 2007 but where he nonetheless obtained his baccalaur√©at in 1973. Sarkozy enrolled at the Universit√© Paris X Nanterre, where he graduated with an M.A. in private law and, later, with a D.E.A. degree in business law. Paris X Nanterre had been the starting place for the May '68 student movement and was still a stronghold of leftist students. Described as a quiet student, Sarkozy soon joined the right-wing student organization, in which he was very active. He completed his military service as a part-time Air Force cleaner. After graduating from university, Sarkozy entered Sciences Po, where he studied between 1979 and 1981, but failed to graduateAugustin Scalbert, Un soup√ßon de vantardise sur les CV minist√©riels, Rue 89, 18 September 2007 due to an insufficient command of the English language.Un pouvoir nomm√© d√©sir, Catherine Nay, 2007 After passing the bar, Sarkozy became a lawyer specializing in business and family law and was one of Silvio Berlusconi's French lawyers. =Marriages= Marie-Dominique Culioli Sarkozy married his first wife, Marie-Dominique Culioli, on 23 September 1982; her father was a pharmacist from Vico (a village north of Ajaccio, Corsica), her uncle was Achille Peretti, the mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine from 1947‚Äì1983 and Sarkozy's political mentor. They had two sons, Pierre (born in 1985), now a hip-hop producer, and Jean (born in 1986) now a local politician in the city of Neuilly-sur-Seine where Sarkozy started his own political career. Sarkozy's best man was the prominent right-wing politician Charles Pasqua, later to become a political opponent.Sarkozy Closes in on his Goal: Ambition and Honesty on the French Campaign Trail Spiegel.de, 4 September 2007 Sarkozy divorced Culioli in 1996, after they had been separated for several years. C√©cilia Ciganer-Alb√©niz As mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Sarkozy met former fashion model and public relations executive C√©cilia Ciganer-Alb√©niz (great-granddaughter of composer Isaac Alb√©niz and daughter of a Moldovan father), when he officiated at her wedding to television host Jacques Martin. In 1988, she left her husband for Sarkozy, and divorced one year later. She and Sarkozy married in October 1996, with witnesses Martin Bouygues and Bernard Arnault. They have one son, Louis, born 23 April 1997. Between 2002 and 2005, the couple often appeared together on public occasions, with C√©cilia Sarkozy acting as the chief aide for her husband. On 25 May 2005, however, the Swiss newspaper Le Matin revealed that she had left Sarkozy for French- Moroccan national Richard Attias, head of Publicis in New York. There were other accusations of a private nature in Le Matin, which led to Sarkozy suing the paper. In the meantime, he was said to have had an affair with a journalist of Le Figaro, Anne Fulda. Sarkozy and C√©cilia ultimately divorced on 15 October 2007, soon after his election as president. Carla Bruni Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni greet President Barack Obama at the G8 Summit dinner in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011. Less than a month after separating from C√©cilia, Sarkozy met Italian-born singer, songwriter and former fashion model Carla Bruni at a dinner party, and soon entered a relationship with her.France begins to grow weary with the Sarkozy soap opera. The Guardian, 13 January 2008 They married on 2 February 2008 at the √âlys√©e Palace in Paris. The couple have a daughter, Giulia, born on 19 October 2011. It was the first time a French president has publicly had a child while in office. =Personal wealth= Sarkozy declared to the Constitutional Council a net worth of ‚Ç¨2 million, most of the assets being in the form of life insurance policies. As the French President, one of his first actions was to give himself a pay raise: his yearly salary went from ‚Ç¨101,000 to ‚Ç¨240,000 to match his European counterparts . He is also entitled to a mayoral, parliamentarian and presidential pension as a former Mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, member of the National Assembly and President of France. Early political career Sarkozy is recognized by French parties on both the Right and Left as a skilled politician and striking orator.\\"French Populism\\", by Ignacio Ramonet, Le Monde Diplomatique, June 2007 Edition, French version , English translation His supporters within France emphasize his charisma, political innovation and willingness to \\"make a dramatic break\\" amid mounting disaffection against \\"politics as usual\\". Overall, he is considered more pro-American and pro- Israeli than most French politicians. From 2004 to 2007, Sarkozy was president of the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP), France's major right-wing political party, and he was Minister of the Interior in the government of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, with the honorific title of Minister of State, making him effectively the number three official in the French State after President Jacques Chirac and Villepin. His ministerial responsibilities included law enforcement and working to co-ordinate relationships between the national and local governments, as well as Minister of Worship: in this role he created the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM). Previously, he was a d√©put√© in the French National Assembly. He was forced to resign this position in order to accept his ministerial appointment. He previously also held several ministerial posts, including Finance Minister. =In Government: 1993‚Äì1995= Sarkozy's political career began when he was 23, when he became a city councillor in Neuilly-sur-Seine. A member of the Neo-Gaullist party RPR, he went on to be elected mayor of that town, after the death of the incumbent mayor Achille Peretti. Sarkozy had been close to Peretti, as his mother was Peretti's secretary. A more senior RPR councillor, Charles Pasqua, wanted to become mayor, and asked Sarkozy to organize his campaign. Instead Sarkozy took that opportunity to propel himself into the office of mayor.Le Parisien, 11 January 2007 He was the youngest mayor of any town in France with a population of over 50,000. He served from 1983 to 2002. In 1988, he became a deputy in the National Assembly. In 1993, Sarkozy was in the national news for personally negotiating with the \\"Human Bomb\\", a man who had taken small children hostage in a kindergarten in Neuilly. The \\"Human Bomb\\" was killed after two days of talks by policemen of the RAID, who entered the school stealthily while the attacker was resting. At the same time, from 1993 to 1995, he was Minister for the Budget and spokesman for the executive in the cabinet of Prime Minister √âdouard Balladur. Throughout most of his early career, Sarkozy had been seen as a prot√©g√© of Jacques Chirac. During his tenure, he increased France's public debt more than any other French Budget Minister, by the equivalent of ‚Ç¨200 billion (US$260 billion) (FY 1994‚Äì1996). The first two budgets he submitted to the parliament (budgets for FY1994 and FY1995) assumed a yearly budget deficit equivalent to six percent of GDP. According to the Maastricht Treaty, the French yearly budget deficit may not exceed three percent of France's GDP. In 1995, he spurned Chirac and backed √âdouard Balladur for President of France. After Chirac won the election, Sarkozy lost his position as Minister for the Budget, and found himself outside the circles of power. However, he returned after the right-wing defeat at the 1997 parliamentary election, as the number two candidate of the RPR. When the party leader Philippe S√©guin resigned, in 1999, he took the leadership of the Neo-Gaullist party. But it obtained its worst result at the 1999 European Parliament election, winning 12.7% of the votes, less than the dissident Rally for France of Charles Pasqua. Sarkozy lost the RPR leadership. Sarkozy speaking at the congress of his party, 28 November 2004 In 2002, however, after his re-election as President of the French Republic (see 2002 French presidential election), Chirac appointed Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, despite Sarkozy's support of Edouard Balladur for President in 1995.Sauced Sarkozy Felice E. Baker, The Dartmouth Independent, 31 October 2007 Following Chirac's 14 July keynote speech on road safety, Sarkozy as interior minister pushed through new legislation leading to the mass purchase of speed cameras and a campaign to increase the awareness of dangers on the roads. In the cabinet reshuffle of 30 April 2004, Sarkozy became Finance Minister. Tensions continued to build between Sarkozy and Chirac and within the UMP party, as Sarkozy's intentions of becoming head of the party after the resignation of Alain Jupp√© became clear. In party elections of 10 November 2004, Sarkozy became leader of the UMP with 85% of the vote. In accordance with an agreement with Chirac, he resigned as Finance Minister. Sarkozy's ascent was marked by the division of UMP between sarkozystes, such as Sarkozy's \\"first lieutenant\\", Brice Hortefeux, and Chirac loyalists, such as Jean-Louis Debr√©. Sarkozy was made Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) by President Chirac in February 2005. He was re-elected on 13 March 2005 to the National Assembly. (As required by the constitution, he had to resign as a deputy when he became minister in 2002.) On 31 May 2005 the main French news radio station France Info reported a rumour that Sarkozy was to be reappointed Minister of the Interior in the government of Dominique de Villepin without resigning from the UMP leadership. This was confirmed on 2 June 2005, when the members of the government were officially announced. =First term as Minister of the Interior: 2002‚Äì2004= Towards the end of his first term as Minister of the Interior, in 2004, Sarkozy was the most divisive conservative politician in France, according to polls conducted at the beginning of 2004. Sarkozy has sought to ease the sometimes tense relationships between the general French population and the Muslim community. Unlike the Catholic Church in France with their official leaders or Protestants with their umbrella organisations, the French Muslim community had a lack of structure with no group that could legitimately deal with the French government on their behalf. Sarkozy supported the foundation in May 2003 of the private non-profit Conseil fran√ßais du culte musulman (\\"French Council of the Muslim Faith\\"), an organisation meant to be representative of French Muslims.JO associations, 28 May 2003 In addition, Sarkozy has suggested amending the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State, mostly in order to be able to finance mosques and other Muslim institutions with public fundsWorldWide Religious News so that they are less reliant on money from outside France. It was not followed by any concrete measure. =Minister of Finance: 2004= During his short appointment as Minister of Finance, Sarkozy was responsible for introducing a number of policies. The degree to which this reflected lib√©ralisme (a hands- off approach to running the economy) or more traditional French state dirigisme (intervention) is controversial. He resigned the day following his election as president of the UMP. * In September 2004, Sarkozy oversaw the reduction of the government ownership stake in France T√©l√©com from 50.4 percent to 41 percent. * Sarkozy backed a partial nationalisation of the large engineering company Alstom decided by his predecessor when the company was exposed to bankruptcy in 2003. * In June 2004, Sarkozy reached an agreement with the major retail chains in France to concertedly lower prices on household goods by an average of two percent; the success of this measure is disputed, with studies suggesting that the decrease was close to one percent in September. * Taxes: Sarkozy avoided taking a position on the ISF (solidarity tax on wealth). This is considered an ideological symbol by many on the left and right. Some in the business world and on the liberal right, such as Alain Madelin, wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by the left as a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties. =Second term as Minister of the Interior: 2005‚Äì2007= Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, after their bilateral meeting in Washington, D.C., 12 September 2006 During his second term at the Ministry of the Interior, Sarkozy was initially more discreet about his ministerial activities: instead of focusing on his own topic of law and order, many of his declarations addressed wider issues, since he was expressing his opinions as head of the UMP party. However, the civil unrest in autumn 2005 put law enforcement in the spotlight again. Sarkozy was accused of having provoked the unrest by calling young delinquents from housing projects a \\"rabble\\" (\\"racaille\\") in Argenteuil near Paris, and controversially suggested cleansing the minority suburbs with a K√§rcher. After the accidental death of two youths, which sparked the riots, Sarkozy first blamed it on \\"hoodlums\\" and gangsters. These remarks were sharply criticised by many on the left wing and by a member of his own government, Delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities Azouz Begag.Azouz Begag, principal opposant √† Nicolas Sarkozy, Le Monde, 2 November 2005 After the rioting, he made a number of announcements on future policy: selection of immigrants, greater tracking of immigrants, and a reform on the 1945 ordinance government justice measures for young delinquents. =UMP leader: 2004‚Äì2007= Nicolas Sarkozy in 2006 with Cypriot opposition leader Nicos Anastasiades Before he was elected President of France, Sarkozy was president of UMP, the French conservative party, elected with 85 percent of the vote. During his presidency, the number of members increased significantly. In 2005, he supported a \\"yes\\" vote in the French referendum on the European Constitution, but the \\"No\\" vote won. Throughout 2005, Sarkozy called for radical changes in France's economic and social policies. These calls culminated in an interview with Le Monde on 8 September 2005, during which he claimed that the French had been misled for 30 years by false promises. Among other issues: * he called for a simplified and \\"fairer\\" taxation system, with fewer loopholes and a maximum taxation rate (all direct taxes combined) at 50 percent of revenue; * he approved measures reducing or denying social support to unemployed workers who refuse work offered to them; * he pressed for a reduction in the budget deficit, claiming that the French state had been living off credit for some time. Such policies are what are called in France lib√©ral (that is, in favour of laissez-faire economic policies) or, with a pejorative undertone, ultra-lib√©ral. Sarkozy rejects this label of lib√©ral and prefers to call himself a pragmatist. Sarkozy opened another avenue of controversy by declaring that he wanted a reform of the immigration system, with quotas designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy. He also wanted to reform the current French system for foreign students, saying that it enabled foreign students to take open-ended curricula in order to obtain residency in France; instead, he wanted to select the best students to the best curricula in France. In early 2006, the French parliament adopted a controversial bill known as DADVSI, which reforms French copyright law. Since his party was divided on the issue, Sarkozy stepped in and organised meetings between various parties involved. Later, groups such as the Odebi League and EUCD.info alleged that Sarkozy personally and unofficially supported certain amendments to the law, which enacted strong penalties against designers of peer-to-peer systems. =Presidential election: 2007= S√©gol√®ne Royal was Sarkozy's final opponent during the 2007 campaign. Sarkozy was a likely candidate for the presidency in 2007; in an oft-repeated comment made on television channel France 2, when asked by a journalist whether he thought about the presidential election when he shaved in the morning, Sarkozy commented, \\"Not just when I shave\\".Broadcast of \\"France 2\\" , 19 November 2003 On 14 January 2007, Sarkozy was chosen by the UMP to be its candidate in the 2007 presidential election.

In February 2007, Sarkozy appeared on a televised debate on TF1 where he expressed his support for affirmative action and the freedom to work overtime. Despite his opposition to same-sex marriage, he advocated civil unions and the possibility for same-sex partners to inherit under the same regime as married couples. The law was voted in July 2007. On 7 February, Sarkozy decided in favour of a projected second, non-nuclear, aircraft carrier for the national Navy (adding to the nuclear Charles de Gaulle), during an official visit in Toulon with Defence Minister Mich√®le Alliot-Marie. \\"This would allow permanently having an operational ship, taking into account the constraints of maintenance\\", he explained.Sarkozy pour un deuxi√®me porte-avions fran√ßais (AFP) On 21 March, President Jacques Chirac announced his support for Sarkozy.

The official transfer of power from Chirac to Sarkozy took place on 16 May at 11:00 am (9:00 UTC) at the √âlys√©e Palace, where he was given the authorization codes of the French nuclear arsenal. In the afternoon, the new President flew to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

In addition to Kouchner, three more Sarkozy ministers are from the left, including √âric Besson, who served as S√©gol√®ne Royal's economic adviser at the beginning of her campaign. Sarkozy also appointed seven women to form a total cabinet of 15; one, Justice Minister Rachida Dati, is the first woman of Northern African origin to serve in a French cabinet. Of the 15, two attended the elite √âcole nationale d'administration (ENA).France's New Government ‚Äì A study in perpetual motion, The Economist, 23 June 2007 The ministers were reorganised, with the controversial creation of a 'Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Co-Development'‚Äîgiven to his right-hand man Brice Hortefeux‚Äîand of a 'Ministry of Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Administration'‚Äîhanded out to √âric W≈ìrth, supposed to prepare the replacement of only a third of all civil servants who retire. However, after 17 June parliamentary elections, the Cabinet was adjusted to 15 ministers and 16 deputy ministers, totalling 31 officials. Sarkozy broke with the custom of amnestying traffic tickets and of releasing thousands of prisoners from overcrowded jails on Bastille Day, a tradition that Napoleon had started in 1802 to commemorate the storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution.

In October 2008, Sarkozy became the first French President to address the National Assembly of Quebec. In his speech he spoke out against Quebec separatism, but recognized Quebec as a nation within Canada. He said that, to France, Canada was a friend, and Quebec was family. =Release of hostages= Shortly after taking office, Sarkozy began negotiations with Colombian president √Ålvaro Uribe and the left-wing guerrilla FARC, regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially Franco-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt. According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC's \\"chancellor\\" Rodrigo Granda.Llama G8 a FARC contribuir a liberaci√≥n de rehenes , La Cronica, 8 June 2007 Furthermore, he announced on 24 July 2007, that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya to their country.

In July, the UMP majority, seconded by the Nouveau Centre, ratified one of Sarkozy's electoral promises, which was to partially revoke the inheritance tax.Les d√©put√©s votent la quasi-suppression des droits de succession, Le Figaro, 13 July 2007 Les droits de succession (presque) supprim√©s, Lib√©ration, 13 July 2007 The inheritance tax formerly brought eight billion euros into state coffers.Droits de succession: pour une minorit√© de m√©nages ais√©s, L'Humanit√©, 7 June 2007 G-8 Summit in 2009 Sarkozy's UMP majority prepared a budget that reduced taxes, in particular for upper middle- class people, allegedly in an effort to boost GDP growth, but did not reduce state expenditures. He was criticised by the European Commission for doing so. On 23 July 2008, parliament voted the \\"loi de modernisation de l'√©conomie\\" (Modernization of the Economy Law) which loosened restrictions on retail prices and reduced limitations on the creation of businesses. The Government has also made changes to long-standing French work-hour regulations, allowing employers to negotiate overtime with employees and making all hours worked past the traditional French 35-hour week tax-free. Nicolas Sarkozy addresses the E-G8 Forum in Paris in 2011 However, as a result of the global financial crisis that came to a head in September 2008, Sarkozy has returned to the state interventionism of his predecessors, declaring that \\"laissez-faire capitalism is over\\" and denouncing the \\"dictatorship of the market\\". Confronted with the suggestion that he had become a socialist, he responded: \\"Have I become socialist? Perhaps.\\" He has also pledged to create 100,000 state-subsidised jobs. This reversion to dirigisme is seen as an attempt to stem the growing popularity of revolutionary socialist leader Olivier Besancenot. =Security policy= Sarkozy's government issued a decree on 7 August 2007 to generalise a voluntary biometric profiling program of travellers in airports. The program, called 'Parafes', was to use fingerprints. The new database would be interconnected with the Schengen Information System (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons (FPR). The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libert√©s (CNIL) protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.G√©n√©ralisation du fichage biom√©trique volontaire des voyageurs dans les a√©roports fran√ßais , Le Monde, 8 August 2007 =Constitutional reform= On 21 July 2008, the French parliament passed constitutional reforms which Sarkozy had made one of the key pledges of his presidential campaign. The vote was 539 to 357, one vote over the three-fifths majority required; the changes are not yet finalized. They would introduce a two-term limit for the presidency, and end the president's right of collective pardon. They would allow the president to address parliament in-session, and parliament, to set its own agenda. They would give parliament a veto over some presidential appointments, while ending government control over parliament's committee system.

Sarkozy wielded special international power when France held the rotating EU Council Presidency from July 2008 through December 2008. Sarkozy has publicly stated his intention to attain EU approval of a progressive energy package before the end of his EU Presidency. This energy package would clearly define climate change objectives for the EU and hold members to specific reductions in emissions. In further support of his collaborative outlook on climate change, Sarkozy has led the EU into a partnership with China.New chapter opens in EU-China Climate Change Partnership EUbusiness.com, 29 April 2008 On 6 December 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of France's then presidency of the Council of the EU, met the Dalai Lama in Poland and outraged China, which has announced that it would postpone the China-EU summit indefinitely.

Climate Summit on 22 September 2009.NPR.org On 5 January 2009, Sarkozy called for a ceasefire plan for the Gaza Strip Conflict. The plan, which was jointly proposed by Sarkozy and Egyptian ex-President Hosni Mubarak envisions the continuation of the delivery of aid to Gaza and talks with Israel on border security, a key issue for Israel as it says Hamas smuggles its rockets into Gaza through the Egyptian border. Welcoming the proposal, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for a \\"ceasefire that can endure and that can bring real security\\". =Military intervention in Libya= Muammar Gaddafi's official visit to Nicolas Sarkozy in December 2007 triggered a strong wave of protests against the President in France. Sarkozy at the Paris Summit of 19 March 2011, which marked the start of a military intervention in Libya In March 2011, after having been criticized for his unwillingness to support the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, and persuaded by the philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy to have France actively engage against the forces of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, Nicolas Sarkozy was amongst the first Heads of State to demand the resignation of Gaddafi and his government, which was then fighting a civil war in Libya. On 10 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy welcomed to the Elysee Palace, three emissaries from the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC), brought to him by Bernard-Henri Levy who mediated at the meeting. Nicolas Sarkozy promised them a no-fly zone would be imposed on Gaddafi's aeroplanes. He also promised them French military assistance. On 17 March 2011, at the behest of France, resolution 1973 was adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations, permitting the creation of a \\"no fly\\" zone over Libya, and for the undertaking of \\"necessary measures\\" for the protection of the country's civilian population. On 19 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy officially announced the beginning of a military intervention in Libya, with France's participation. These actions of Nicolas Sarkozy were favorably received by the majority of the French political class and public opinion. \\"No Exit\\" by Philip Gourevitch, 12 December 2011, New Yorker In 2016, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament published a report stating that the military intervention \\"was based on erroneous assumptions\\" that the threat of a massacre of civilian populations has been \\"overvalued\\" and that the coalition \\"Has not verified the real threat to civilians\\"; He also believes that the true motivations of Nicolas Sarkozy were to serve French interests and to \\"improve his political situation in France\\".http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2016/09/14/01003-20160914ARTFIG00259-royaume- uni-un-rapport-parlementaire-ereinte-sarkozy-et-cameron-pour-l-intervention- en-libye.php =2012 presidential campaign= Popularity polls during his presidency Sarkozy was one of ten candidates who qualified for the first round of voting.D√©cision du 19 mars 2012 arr√™tant la liste des candidats √† l‚Äô√©lection pr√©sidentielle ‚Äì Conseil Constitutionnel Fran√ßois Hollande, the Socialist Party candidate, received the most votes in the first round held on 22 April election, with Sarkozy coming second, meaning that both progressed to the second round of voting on 5‚Äì6 May 2012.

The French media have pointed out that Carla Bruni frequently wears flats when in public with him. In 2009, a worker at a factory where Sarkozy gave a speech said she was asked to stand next to him because she was of a similar height to Sarkozy. (This story was corroborated by some trade union officials.) This was the subject of a political row: the president's office called the accusation \\"completely absurd and grotesque\\", while the Socialist Party mocked his fastidious preparation. Sarkozy with Mohammad bin Salman, Gianni Infantino and Juan Carlos Varela at the FIFA World Cup in Russia, 14 June 2018 Sarkozy lost a suit against a manufacturer of Sarkozy voodoo dolls, in which he claimed that he had a right to his own image. Sarkozy was nicknamed as Hyper-president or hyperpresident by some French media after his 2007 election as president. It is a portmanteau of hyper and president to insist on the desire of Sarkozy to control everything.L'hyper-pr√©sident, Le Monde, 06 Juin 2007 ¬´Le nouveau pr√©sident de la R√©publique a marqu√© des points gr√¢ce √† son style direct, son art de la communication, son omnipr√©sence sur tous les fronts int√©rieurs et ext√©rieurs, sa volont√© affich√©e d'engager les r√©formes promises¬ª Whereas in the history of the Fifth Republic, the successive presidents were traditionally focused on the foreign policy of the country and on international relations, leaving the Prime Minister and the government to determine the domestic policy, as the Constitution states it, Nicolas Sarkozy appeared to determine both the foreign and domestic policy. Some compared Nicolas Sarkozy to Napol√©on Bonaparte and Louis XIV. Indeed, he appointed a very close friend of his, Fran√ßois Fillon, as a Prime Minister. Fran√ßois Fillon was accused of being an instrument of the President's power. The biopic The Conquest is a 2011 film that dramatizes Sarkozy's rise to power, with candid portrayals of Sarkozy himself, Chirac and Villepin. It was shown at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. Controversies Sarkozy is generally disliked by the left and has been criticised by some on the right, most vocally by moderate Gaullist supporters of Jacques Chirac and Dominique de Villepin. The communist-leaning magazine L'Humanit√© accused Sarkozy of populism.L'Humanit√©, Humanite.presse.fr , 11 June 2005 =Views on religions= Many on the left distrust Sarkozy; specific \\"anti-Sarko\\" movements have been started. In 2004 Sarkozy co-authored a book, La R√©publique, les religions, l'esp√©rance (The Republic, Religions, and Hope), in which he argued that the young should not be brought up solely on secular or republican values. He advocated reducing the separation of church and state, arguing for the government subsidies for mosques to encourage Islamic integration into French society. He has opposed financing of religious institutions with funds from outside France. After meeting with Tom Cruise, Sarkozy was criticized by some for meeting with a member of the Church of Scientology, which has been seen by some as a cult.Worldwide Religious News, 2 September 2004 Sarkozy was criticized by some Christians after he claimed \\"the roots of France are essentially Christian\\" at a December 2007 speech in Rome. Similarly, he drew criticism from Christians after he called Islam \\"one of the greatest and most beautiful civilizations the world has known\\" at a speech in Riyadh in January 2008. =Controversial statements= In the midst of a tense period and following the accidental death of an 11-year-old boy in the Paris suburb of La Courneuve in June 2005, Sarkozy quoted a local resident and vowed to clean the area out \\"with a K√§rcher\\" (a high-pressure hose). Two days before the 2005 Paris riots he referred to young criminals of nearby housing projects as \\"voyous\\" (\\"thugs\\") and \\"racaille\\", a slang term which can be translated into English as \\"rabble\\", \\"scum\\" or \\"riff-raff\\", in answer to resident who addressed Sarkozy with \\"Quand nous d√©barrassez-vous de cette racaille?\\" (\\"When will you rid us of these dregs?\\") The French Communist Party publication, L'Humanit√©, branded this language as inappropriate. Following Sarkozy's use of the word racaille many people in the banlieues identified him as a politician of the far right. His period as Interior Minister saw the use of police as shock troops in the \\"banlieues\\", and a police \\"raid\\" on the suburb of Clichy- sous-Bois in October 2005 led to two boys being electrocuted in a power sub- station. The riots began that night.The Independent, 17 April 2007, p. 20, \\"The banlieues prepare to vote: We hate Sarkozy because he hates us.\\" In September 2005 Sarkozy was accused of pushing for a hasty inquiry into an arson attack on a police station in Pau, of which the alleged perpetrators were acquitted for lack of proof. On 22 June 2005 Sarkozy told law enforcement officials that he had questioned the Minister of Justice about the future of \\"the judge\\" who had freed a man on parole who had later committed a murder. A few weeks before the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, Sarkozy had an interview with philosopher Michel Onfray.online extracts, Philosophie Magazine, nr 8, April 2007 Sarkozy stated that disorders such as paedophilia and depression have a genetic as well as social basis, saying \\"... I'd be inclined to think that one is born a paedophile, and it is actually a problem that we do not know how to cure this disease\\"; he claimed that suicides among youth were linked to genetic predispositions by stating, \\"I don't want to give parents a complex. It's not exclusively the parents' fault every time a youngster commits suicide.\\" These statements were criticised by some scientists, including geneticist Axel Kahn.\\"Un g√®ne ne commande jamais un destin humain\\", 4 April 2007, L'Humanit√©.\\"Toll√© dans la communaut√© scientifique apr√®s les propos de Nicolas Sarkozy sur la g√©n√©tique\\" , 11 April 2007Le Monde (in French).

On 30 July 2010, Sarkozy suggested a new policy of security, and he proposed \\"stripping foreign-born French citizens who opted to acquire their nationality at their majority of their citizenship if they are convicted of threatening the life of a police officer or other serious crimes\\". This policy has been criticized for example by the US newspaper The New York Times, by Sarkozy's political opponents, including the Socialist Party leader Martine Aubry, and by experts of French law, including the ex- member of the Constitutional Council of France, Robert Badinter, who said that such action would be unconstitutional. He called for coercive methods to promote \\"m√©tissage,\\" cultural mixing (which can sometimes include genetic mixing), which he called an \\"obligation\\" during a press conference on 17 December 2008. =\\"Casse-toi, pauv'con\\"= On 23 February 2008, Sarkozy was filmed by a reporter for French newspaper Le Parisien having the following exchange while visiting the Paris International Agricultural Show: > While quickly crossing the hall Saturday morning, in the middle of the > crowd, Sarkozy encounters a recalcitrant visitor who refuses to shake his > hand. \\"Ah no, don't touch me!\\", said the man.

On 28 August 2008, Herv√© Eon, from Laval came to an anti-Sarkozy demonstration with a sign bearing the words Casse-toi pov' con, the exact words Sarkozy had uttered. Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the prosecutor, who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of ‚Ç¨1000. The court eventually imposed a symbolic ‚Ç¨30 suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side. This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, as president of the Republic, is immune from prosecution, notably restricting Eon's rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation. =Position on the Iraq war= Sarkozy opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. However, he was critical of the way Chirac and his foreign minister Dominique de Villepin expressed France's opposition to the war. Talking at the French-American Foundation in Washington, D.C. on 12 September 2006, he denounced what he called the \\"French arrogance\\" and said: \\"It is bad manners to embarrass one's allies or sound like one is taking delight in their troubles.\\" He added: \\"We must never again turn our disagreements into a crisis.\\" Chirac reportedly said in private that Sarkozy's speech was \\"appalling\\" and \\"a shameful act\\". =Accusations of nepotism= In October 2009, Sarkozy was accused of nepotism for helping his son, Jean, try to become head of the public body running France's biggest business district EPAD.Angelique Chrisafis (Oct 2009). \\"Sarkozy's son sparks nepotism row after being tipped for top public job\\" The Guardian, Friday 9 October 2009.

The visit marked the first time Gaddafi had been to France in more than 35 years and, during it, France agreed to sell Libya 21 Airbus aircraft and signed a nuclear cooperation agreement. Negotiations for the purchase of more than a dozen Dassault Rafale fighter jets, plus military helicopters, were also initiated during the trip. The government of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi allegedly paid ‚Ç¨50 million to Sarkozy in exchange for access. Initial allegations During the 2011 Libyan Civil War ‚Äì a conflict in which France intervened ‚Äì Saif-al-Islam Gaddafi said in an interview with euronews that the Libyan state had donated ‚Ç¨50 million to Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for access and favors by Sarkozy. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's claim was later repeated by former Libyan prime minister Baghdadi Mahmudi in October of that year, though Sarkozy denied its veracity. Investigative website Mediapart subsequently published several documents appearing to prove a payment of ‚Ç¨50 million, and also published a claim by Ziad Takieddine that he had personally handed three briefcases stuffed with cash to Sarkozy. French magistrates later acquired diaries of former Libyan oil minister Shukri Ghanem in which payments to Sarkozy were mentioned. Shortly thereafter, however, Ghanem was found dead, floating in the Danube in Austria and thereby preventing his corroboration of the diaries. Inquiry and arrests A judicial investigation against then-unidentified persons was initiated in April 2013 in Paris. In January 2018, British police arrested Alexandre Djouhri on a European Arrest Warrant. Djouhri was an associate of Sarkozy and had refused to respond to a French judicial summons for questioning over allegations he had helped launder Libyan funds on behalf of Sarkozy. The following month, Asharq Al-Awsat quoted a source who alleged Sarkozy had promised Libyan representatives improved relations between France and Libya should he be elected president, and that he would wrap-up the matter of the bombing of UTA Flight 772. On 20 March, Sarkozy was arrested by French police and held for questioning concerning the various allegations about a Libyan connection, the first time he had been interrogated in relation to the matter. Brice Hortefeux was also brought in by police for questioning. Following Sarkozy's arrest, Saif al-Islam expressed a willingness to testify in any future trial. He also claimed that a former officer of the Libyan intelligence service was in possession of a recording of a meeting between his father and Sarkozy in Tripoli in 2007 at which payments were discussed. The Republicans, meanwhile, issued a statement in which the party said the former president had their full support. Spokesman Christian Jacob later suggested that the accusations against Sarkozy were politically motivated.  Police custody and indiction  On 20 and 21 March 2018, Sarkozy was put into police custody and held for questioning concerning the Libyan connection. He was formally charged with bribery and accepting illegal campaign contributions at the issue of this custody.

Biography Zamboni was born in 1901 in Eureka, Utah, to Italian immigrants. His parents soon bought a farm in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho near Pocatello, Idaho, where he grew up. In 1920, he moved with his parents to the harbor district of Los Angeles, where his older brother George was operating an auto repair shop. After Frank attended a trade school in Chicago, he and his younger brother Lawrence opened an electrical supply business in 1922 in the Los Angeles suburb of Hynes (now part of Paramount). The following year he married and eventually had three children, a son and two daughters. In 1927, he and Lawrence added an ice-making plant and entered the block ice business. They continued their ice business in 1939, but saw little future in that business with the advent of electrically operated refrigeration units. They decided to use their excess refrigeration equipment to open an ice rink nearby. In 1940, the brothers, along with a cousin, Pete Zamboni, opened the Iceland rink, which proved very popular, in no small part because Frank had devised a way to eliminate rippling caused by the pipes that were laid down to keep the rink frozen. (The rink still operates and is still owned by the Zamboni family.) He obtained a patent for that innovation in 1946. Then, in 1949, he invented a machine that transformed the job of resurfacing an ice rink from a five-man, 90-minute task to a one-man, 15-minute job. The initial machine included a hydraulic cylinder from an A-20 attack plane, a chassis from an oil derrick, a Jeep engine, a wooden bin to catch the shavings, and a series of pulleys. His son, Richard, said, \\"It took him nine years. One of the reasons he stuck with it was that everyone told him he was crazy.\\" Zamboni did not expect to make more but, after seeing the machine, Sonja Henie immediately ordered two, and then the Chicago Blackhawks placed an order. Zamboni applied for a patent in 1949 ‚Äì obtained in 1953 ‚Äì and set up Frank J. Zamboni & Co. in Paramount to build and sell the machines. The machine shaves ice off the surface, collects the shavings, washes the ice, and spreads a thin coat of fresh water onto the surface. In the early 1950s, Zamboni built them on top of Jeep CJ-3Bs, then on stripped Jeep chassis from 1956 through 1964. Demand for the machine proved great enough that his company added a second plant in Brantford, Ontario and a branch office in Switzerland. Though the term Zamboni was (and remains) trademarked by his company, the name is sometimes generically used for any brand of ice resurfacing machine. Zamboni's famous invention was the ice resurfacer; he created it in 1949. In the 1970s, he invented machines to remove water from outdoor artificial turf surfaces, remove paint stripes from the same surfaces, and roll up and lay down artificial turf in domed stadiums. His final invention, in 1983, was an automatic edger to remove ice buildup from the edges of rinks. He died of cardiac arrest at Long Beach Memorial Hospital in July 1988 at the age of 87, about two months after his wife's death. He also had lung cancer. The Zamboni company has sold more than 10,000 units of its signature machine, the Zamboni Ice Resurfacer, commonly known as a \\"Zamboni.\\" The 10,000th machine was delivered to the Montreal Canadiens in April 2012 for use at the Bell Centre. The company is still owned and operated by the Zamboni family, including Frank's son and grandson. His remains are buried at All Souls Cemetery in Long Beach. Zamboni was inducted into the Ice Skating Institute's Hall of Fame in 1965, and he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from Clarkson University in 1988. Frank was posthumously inducted into the NEISMA Hall of Fame in 1988, the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2000, the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2006, the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007, the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009, and into the United States Speed Skating Hall of Fame in 2013. The Frank J. Zamboni School, in Paramount, is named after him.

He descends from an old aristocratic family of Poland with coat of arms ≈Åada. He translated many French comedies, among others those by Moli√®re, but also wrote his own plays concentrating on Polish issues. From 1774, he worked in the Commission for National Education and in 1794, he took part in the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. During the next year he gave up literature and became a priest. Literary career Zab≈Çocki's literary career began with the publication of his work in the Polish literary magazine 'Fin, Fun and Useful'. The magazine was the first of its kind in Poland, and was launched in the year 1770. During King Stanislaw August's reign, Warsaw was the scene of great literary activity. The King used to host literary figures for dinner every Thursday. Zablocki was a regular invitee to these parties, which included in its guest list such Polish luminaries as A. Naruszewicz and I. Krasicki. During one such meeting, Zab≈ÇockiAt was asked to read his first comedy 'Fri Zabobonnik'. The King was so enraptured by this song that he bestowed the Merentibus medal on Zab≈Çocki. After that Zablocki turned to writing plays, producing an astounding 40 plays in ten years. He mostly wrote comedies. His major works are Amphitryon (1783), Sarmatism (1785), Muhammad Harlequin (1785), King of bliss in the country (1787), Yellow nightcap (1783), Doctor of Lublin (1781), Gamrat (1785) and The Marriage of Figaro (1786).

He worked as a singer, theologian, and writer on music in northern Italy and Austria; for a time he was in the employ of Archduke Karl of Graz, and worked in Graz and Vienna. Biography Born in Pesaro, in the Marche, Zacconi became an Augustinian friar at Venice, where he was ordained priest. In 1577 he was in Venice studying at the church of San Stefano, and at some point in the following six years he was accepted by Andrea Gabrieli as a student of counterpoint. In 1584 he auditioned at San Marco as a singer, and was accepted; however he seems to have declined the position. Also at this time he met Zarlino, the prominent Venetian School theorist; he was to mention the meeting in the second part of his Prattica di musica (1622). On 20 July 1585, he joined the musical establishment of Archduke Karl of Graz, a position he retained until Karl's death in 1590. Subsequently he joined the chapel of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, which was directed by Orlande de Lassus. In 1596 he left the employ of Wilhelm, returning to Italy; in the following years he worked as a prior at Pesaro, and as a preacher and administrator in both Italy and Crete. He retired to Pesaro in 1612, where he remained until his death (at Fiorenzuola di Focara, near Pesaro). Works Zacconi's fame rests on his great work Prattica di Musica, first published in 1592 at Venice, of which a second volume appeared in 1619 (or, according to other sources, 1622). His theoretical works are conservative, and make no mention of the emerging Baroque style, in spite of his studies with the distinguished Venetian composer Andrea Gabrieli. His most important works are the two books of Prattica di musica (Musical Practice) which he published in Venice in 1592 and 1622. These two volumes‚Äîcontaining four works‚Äîtreat exhaustively of musical theory, and are copiously illustrated. The directions for rendering polyphonic music are of the highest value, especially the Palestrina illustrations. He deals fully with the six Authentic and six Plagal Modes, studiously omitting the Locrian and Hypolocrian Modes. But he also treats of orchestral instruments‚Äîtheir compass and method of playing‚Äîand gives valuable information as to the scoring of early operas and oratorios. In fact he covers the whole ground of music, as practised at the close of the 16th century. Zacconi's treatises are an invaluable guide to the study of performance practice of vocal music of the very late Renaissance. Parts of his work were incorporated by Michael Praetorius into his Syntagma musicum (1618), and by Pietro Cerone into his Melopeo y maestro (1613).

She has served four separate terms as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. She is the national president of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which focuses on a platform of social change for Bahujans, more commonly known as Other Backward Castes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as well as converted minorities from these castes. She was chief minister briefly in 1995 and again in 1997, then from 2002 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2012. Mayawati's rise from humble beginnings has been called a \\"miracle of democracy\\" by P. V. Narasimha Rao, former prime minister of India. In 1993 Kanshi Ram formed a coalition with the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 1995. She was the first female Scheduled Caste chief minister in India. In 1997 and in 2002 she was chief minister with outside support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the second time only for a year up to 26 August 2003 due to BJP withdrawing support. Mayawati's tenure has attracted praise and criticism. Millions of Dalits view her as an icon, and refer to her as Behen-ji (sister). She has been praised for her fundraising efforts on behalf of her party and her birthdays have been widely celebrated by her supporters. The rise in her personal wealth and that of her party have been criticised as indicative of corruption. After losing the 2012 legislative assembly elections to the rival Samajwadi Party, she resigned from her post as party leader on 7 March 2012. Later that month, she was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian parliament.  Early life and education  Mayawati was born on 15 January 1956 at Shrimati Sucheta Kriplani Hospital, New Delhi into a Dalit family of Chamar caste. Her father, Prabhu Das, was a post office employee at Badalpur, Gautam Buddha Nagar. The sons in the family were sent to private schools, while the daughters went to \\"low-performing government schools\\". Mayawati studied for her B.A. in 1975 at the Kalindi College, University of Delhi and later obtained her LLB from University of Delhi. She completed a B.Ed. from Meerut University's VMLG College, Ghaziabad, in 1976. She was working as a teacher in Inderpuri JJ Colony, Delhi, and studying for the Indian Administrative Services exams, when Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other backward castes politician Kanshi Ram visited her family home in 1977. According to biographer Ajoy Bose, Ram told her: \\"I can make you such a big leader one day that not one but a whole row of IAS officers will line up for your orders.\\" In 1983, Mayawati was awarded her LL.B from University of Delhi. Kanshi Ram included her as a member of his team when he founded the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in 1984. Mayawati was first elected to Parliament in 1989.  Early political career  Mayawati with Akhilesh Yadav Kanshi Ram founded the BSP in 1984. Influenced by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India, the party's primary focus is to improve the situation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other disadvantaged groups through policy reform, affirmative action on hiring of members of scheduled castes for government posts, and providing rural development programmes. Reservation in India is a system whereby a percentage of government positions and seats at universities are reserved for persons of backward classes and scheduled castes and tribes. Throughout her political career, Mayawati supported reservation in both government and private sectors for backward classes, with an increase in quotas and inclusion of more communities such as religious minorities and economically weak upper castes. In August 2012 a bill was cleared that starts the process of amending the constitution so that the reservation system can be expanded to promotions in state jobs. Mayawati's career has been called a \\"miracle of democracy\\" by former Prime Minister of India P. V. Narasimha Rao. Millions of Dalit supporters view her as an icon and refer to her as \\"Behen-ji\\" (sister). Her public meetings have been attended by large audiences, who use slogans such as \\"Kanshi Ram ka mission Adhoora; karegi Behen Mayawati poora\\" (Kanshi Ram's unfulfilled mission will be completed by Mayawati) and \\"Behenji tum sangharsh karo; hum tumhare saath hain\\" (Sister, go ahead with your struggle; we are with you). In its first election campaign in 1984, BSP fielded Mayawati for the Lok Sabha (Lower House) seat of Kairana in the Muzaffarnagar district, for Bijnor in 1985, and for Haridwar in 1987. In 1989 she was elected as the representative for Bijnor, with 183,189 votes, winning by 8,879 votes. Although BSP did not win control of the house, the electoral experience led to considerable activity for Mayawati over the next five years, as she worked with Mahsood Ahmed and other organisers. The party won three seats in the 1989 national election and two seats 1991. Mayawati was first elected to the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 1994. In 1995 she became, as head of her party, Chief Minister in a short-lived coalition government, the youngest Chief Minister in the history of the state up until that point, and the first female Dalit Chief Minister in India. She won election to the Lok Sabha in two different constituencies in 1996 and chose to serve for Harora. She became Chief Minister again for a short period in 1997 and then from 2002 to 2003 in coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party. In 2001 Ram named her as his successor to the party leadership. = BSP presidentship = On 15 December 2001, in an address during a rally in Lucknow, Kanshi Ram named Mayawati as his successor. She was elected national president of the BSP for her first term on 18 September 2003. She was elected unopposed for a second consecutive term on 27 August 2006, for a third term on 30 August 2014 and for fourth term on 28 August 2019.  Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh  As the Chief Minister, Mayawati gained a reputation for efficient governance and promoting law and order, winning praise even from opposition parties and other rivals. In 2007, MLA Umakant Yadav of her own political party accused in a land grabbing case, was arrested near her dwelling on her orders. During September‚ÄìOctober 2010, at the time of the Ayodhya verdict, her government maintained law and order and the state remained peaceful. Several high-profile criminals and mafia dons were jailed during her terms in office. She called for strong anti-rape laws. Fewer riots, lowest rapes, and least corruption occurred during her tenure as compared to previous or successive governments. In the 2007-2012 assembly, only 124 MLAs were crorepatis as compared to 271 crorepatis in successive assembly elected in 2012. Uttar Pradesh achieved higher GDP growth rate at 17 per cent and lesser crimes under Mayawati regime as compared to previous and successive governments. = First term, 1995 = Mayawati first served as Chief Minister from 3 June 1995 to 18 October 1995. During this term, the new districts of Ambedkar Nagar district and Udham Singh Nagar district were created. = Second term, 1997 = Her second term was from 21 March 1997 to 20 September 1997. A drive under her government allotted pattas or gram sabha lands on lease to thousands of landless residents. In April 1997, she created Gautam Budh Nagar district from the district of Ghaziabad, Kaushambi district was separated from Allahabad district, and Jyotiba Phule Nagar district from Moradabad district. In May 1997, Mahamaya Nagar district was created out of Aligarh district and Banda district was split into Banda and Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Nagar. Mayawati carried out review meetings with bureaucrats and suspended 127 officers. She setup Dr Ambedkar Awards and erected over 100 statues of various sizes of Ambedkar in Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad and other key towns. = Third term, 2002‚Äì03 = Her third term was from 3 May 2002 to 26 August 2003.

Six IPS officers were suspended for failing to maintain law and order, while 24 officers were warned to improve. She started 511 acre Gautam Buddha University. She renamed King George's Medical University to Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University. She suspended three senior officials after review in a couple of administrative divisions.  2007 State and 2009 general election  Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and one of its poorest, is considered pivotal in the politics of India because of its large number of voters. BSP won a majority in the 2007 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, fielding candidates from a variety of castes and religions. The campaign was accompanied by a colourful slogan: Haathi nahin, Ganesh hain, Brahma, Vishnu Mahesh Hain: \\"The elephant (the BSP logo) is really the Lord Ganesha, the trinity of gods rolled into one\\". The BSP won 20 seats in Lok Sabha from the state of Uttar Pradesh in the 2009 elections, obtaining the highest percentage (27.42%) of votes for any political party in the state. The party placed third in terms of national polling percentage (6.17%). = Fourth term, 2007‚Äì12: BSP absolute majority = Mayawati was sworn in as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh for the fourth time on 13 May 2007. She announced an agenda that focused on providing social justice to the weaker sections of society and providing employment instead of distributing money to the unemployed. Her slogan was to make \\"Uttar Pradesh\\" (\\"Northern Province\\") into \\"Uttam Pradesh\\" (\\"Excellent Province\\"). Her government began a major crackdown on irregularities in the recruitment process of police officers recruited during the previous Mulayam Singh government. Over 18,000 policemen lost their jobs for irregularities in their hiring, and 25 Indian Police Service officers were suspended for their involvement in corruption while recruiting the constables. Mayawati instituted reforms to introduce transparency into the recruiting process, including posting the results of selection exams online. On 10 August 2007, the Mayawati government proposed 30 per cent reservation in jobs in the private sector. A quota for promotions was also introduced, but was later quashed by the Supreme Court of India. In September 2007, Bhimrao Ambedkar Rural Integrated Development Programme was started. The Dr Ambedkar Gram Vikas Yojana scheme was launched for supplying water, electricity, and constructing roads in villages with a Dalit majority. Under this scheme, 24,716 villages received improvements. In 2008, Mayawati launched, Manyawar Shri Kanshiram Ji Shahri Garib Awas Yojna, a scheme for building low-cost housing colonies for urban poor with 90,000 low-cost homes under the first round of construction in different towns and cities across the state while a second and a third round were still underway when government ended in 2012 and next government scrapped the scheme including cutting down electricity of these colonies. Mayawati government started efforts to set up solar power plants and the first 5 MW solar power plant located in Naini of Allahabad district started functioning in March 2012 and was developed by EMC Limited. UP government signed a MoU with NTPC Limited for 1,320-MW power plant. Mayawati's dream project of 165 km six lane Yamuna Expressway connected Delhi to Agra through Noida‚ÄìGreater Noida Expressway, touching 1,182 villages in the state. Later, Indian Air Force fighter jet Dassault Mirage 2000 test-Landed on Yamuna Expressway as Part of Trials. On 15 January 2008, Mayawati inaugurated the construction of the 1,047 km Ganga Expressway at the cost of for joining Ballia to Greater Noida. In November 2009, Mayawati dedicated Noida Metro constructed at the cost of . She had vigorously proposed for construction of Jewar airport near Noida. In October 2011, Mayawati government under public- private partnership with Jaypee Group successfully executed and delivered First F1 Indian Grand Prix, an international event at Buddh International Circuit, Greater Noida constructed by Jaypee Group. The event was hailed as flawlessly conducted salvaging some of India's prestige when compared to minor embarrassments in 2010 Commonwealth Games (Before opening ceremony) conducted in Delhi. Mayawati presented the winning trophy to winner Sebastian Vettel. Foreigners found the track as 'impressive' and 3 Indian teenagers picked by a F1 panel to train them as future Formula One drivers in Europe. Mayawati has seen through to completion of several memorials dedicated to icons of Bahujan Samaj build first time in India, including the Manyawar Shri Kanshiram Ji Green Eco Garden (inaugurated March 2011), the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal and Green Garden (inaugurated October 2011), and the Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Prateek Sthal (opened November 2012). She renamed Amethi district as Chattrapati Sahuji Maharaj Nagar, Kanpur Dehat as Rambai Nagar, Sambhal as Bheem Nagar, Shamli as Prabuddha Nagar, Hapur as Psanchseel Nagar, Kasganj as Kanshiram Nagar, Hathras as Mahamaya Nagar and Amroha as JP Nagar.

Under Savitri Bai Phule Balika Shiksha Madad Yojna, Mayawati distributed over 10 lakh bicycles among Muslim and poor school girls from 2008 to 2011. After coming to power in 2007, Mayawati wrote letters to the Prime Minister regarding partitioning of Uttar Pradesh into four different states in 2007, in March 2008 and December 2009. Finally on 15 November 2011, Mayawati's cabinet approved partitioning Uttar Pradesh into four different states (Pashchim Pradesh, Awadh Pradesh, Bundelkhand and Purvanchal) for better administration and governance. On 6 March 2012 the Bahujan Samaj Party lost its majority to the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati tendered her resignation to the governor of Uttar Pradesh the next day, thereby becoming the first CM to complete full five years in office. On 13 March 2012 she filed nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha, and she was declared elected unopposed on 22 March. = Political and legal issues = Ambedkar Memorial Park at night Mayawati's political career has attracted praise and controversy. She has been praised for her fundraising efforts on behalf of her party, and her birthdays were major media events as well as a symbol for her supporters. The increase in her personal wealth and that of her party have been viewed by critics as signs of corruption. ;Taj corridor case In 2002, the government of Uttar Pradesh began improvements of the infrastructure in the Taj Heritage Corridor, the important tourist area in Agra that includes the Taj Mahal. The project was soon riddled with problems, including funds being released for the project without the submission of the required detailed project reports to the environmental authorities. Suspecting there were financial irregularities as well, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raided twelve residences, including Mayawati's. It had filed a First Information Report against her and seven others two days earlier. The raid uncovered evidence of assets disproportionate to her known income. Afterwards, Mayawati resigned from her own government to prove that she was not \\"hungry for power\\" She asked the BJP- run Government of India to remove Union Tourism and Culture Minister, Jagmohan for conspiring this all controversy against her. In June 2007, Governor T. V. Rajeswar said that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute her. In his 23-page order, he said: \\"the fact that the Mission Management Board, consisting of officers of both the State and the Central Government, regularly met and discussed the project and the fact that even a sum of 17 crores was spent through the Central Government public sector undertaking, NPCC, all go to show that the serious offences with which Mayawati and the Minister were charged do not stand scrutiny.\\" Advocates unsuccessfully challenged the governor's decision in court. The Supreme Court rejected the plea of the CBI and refused to direct the governor to prosecute her. The Taj corridor case was effectively ended before going to trial. ;Disproportionate assets case In the 2007‚Äì08 assessment year, Mayawati paid an income tax of 26 crore, ranking among the top 20 taxpayers in the country. Earlier the CBI filed a case against her for owning assets disproportionate to her known sources of income. Mayawati described the CBI investigation against her as illegal. Her party asserted that her income comes from gifts and small contributions made by party workers and supporters. On 3 August 2011 the Delhi High court dismissed the central government's appeal against Mayawati, stating that \\"she has fully discharged her obligations by disclosing the identities of all of her donors, the gifts had been donated by her supporters\\". The central government decided not to file an appeal in the Supreme Court. On 13 March 2012 Mayawati revealed assets worth 111.26 crore in an affidavit filed with her nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha. The disproportionate assets case was finally quashed on 6 July 2012‚Äînine years later‚Äîby a Supreme Court bench of Justice P Sathasivam and Dipak Misra; the court found that the case was unwarranted. Based on an opinion received from the Directorate of Prosecution, the CBI decided not to file an appeal. On 4 October 2012 a review petition was filed by Kamlesh Verma, contending that the case had been dismissed merely on technical grounds, and that the evidence had not been adequately reviewed. On 8 August 2013 the Supreme Court declined a request to re-open the case. After seeking legal advice, the CBI finally closed their file on 8 October 2013. ;Bahujan Monuments In her tenures as a Chief Minister, Mayawati commissioned the production and public display of several monuments having parks, gallerias, museums, memorials, murals and statues representing Buddhist and Hindu, Dalit/OBC icons like Gautama Buddha, Gadge Maharaj, Sant Ravidas, Sant Kabir, Narayana Guru, Jyotirao Phule, Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, Babasaheb Ambedkar, BSP party founder Kanshi Ram, and of herself. She claims that the expenditure was required because the past governments did not show respect towards Dalit leaders, in whose memory nothing had ever been built. She spent somewhere between 25 and 60 billion rupees (about US$500 million to US$1.3 billion) on projects in five parks and at memorials such as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Sthal and Manyavar Kanshiram Smarak Sthal, built in the name of B.R. Ambedkar, Ramabai Ambedkar, and Kanshi Ram in Lucknow between 2007 and 2009. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India reported that 66 crore (about US$12 million) in excessive costs had been incurred on the construction of the memorials. In February 2010 Mayawati's government approved a plan for a special police force to protect the statues, as she feared that her political opponents might demolish them. In December 2010, her government received permission to continue part of the plan, namely maintenance and completion of Ambedkar Memorial Park. Despite the existing Supreme Court stay, in October 2011 Mayawati inaugurated the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal and Green Garden, built at a cost of 685 crore. Since the memorial also features her own statues, Mayawati was accused by the Indian National Congress of wasting the taxpayers' money. The BSP dismissed the allegations, stating that her statues were erected because Kanshi Ram's will requested that his statues should be constructed next to those of the current President of BSP. Mayawati accused the Congress of being \\"anti-Dalit\\". In January 2012, the Election Commission ordered that all of the statues of Mayawati as well as recent statues of elephants ( the symbol of the Bahujan Samaj Party) should be covered up until after February's Uttar Pradesh election. On 26 July 2012 the statue in Lucknow was damaged by members of a group calling themselves \\"Uttar Pradesh Naunirman Sena\\". A replacement statue was re-installed overnight by the Lucknow city administration. Following the Lucknow vandalism, there were similar such incidents in other parts of Uttar Pradesh. In 2015, the Supreme Court continued hearings on the PLI case about the statues. ;World Bank criticism The World Bank lent India funds for development, and Mayawati was to manage projects with this money in UP. The projects were preplanned and on schedule, but the Mayawati government made changes which put the projects behind schedule, including rapidly transferring high-caste managers in and out of rural posts. The World Bank sent a letter of complaint on 1 August 2002 to India's central government stating, \\"We have now learnt that project managers have been replaced within three weeks of assuming office. The project coordinator of the Diversified Agriculture Support Project has been changed twice in quick succession and at the moment there is no project coordinator. In the forestry project, numerous changes have been made over past six months ... Such developments do not augur well for these time-bound projects that require consistently good leadership.\\" Mayawati initially responded by saying the letter was a fake and later said there had been a misunderstanding. She then decreased the number of transfers, stopped creating new posts, and temporarily reduced the level of government spending on furniture and vehicles in response to the allegations. The World Bank continued to criticise the level of corruption even after these measures had been implemented.  Personal life and public image  Statues of Mayawati (L) and Kanshi Ram (R) at Ambedkar Memorial Park Mayawati started her political career after Kanshi Ram, the founder of Bahujan Samaj Party, persuaded her to join the civil service and politics. Mayawati chose to remain unmarried. She is also known as the Iron Lady Mayawati. Kanshi Ram praised Mayawati at her 47th birthday celebrations for her fundraising activities on behalf of the party. He stated that the party's eventual goal is to gain power at the national level, and that Mayawati's efforts had helped in that quest. Her birthdays have since become major media events at which she has appeared laden with diamonds. Her supporters have declared her birthday as Jan Kalyankari Diwas (People's Welfare Day). In 2009, the day was marked by the announcement of welfare schemes targeted towards poor and downtrodden people of the state and, in 2010, by the launch of social programmes with a value of over 7,312 crore. In 2007‚Äì08, Mayawati paid as income tax. She was at number 20 in I-T department's compilation of the top 200 taxpayers' list with names like Shah Rukh Khan and Sachin Tendulkar. Most of her income comes as \\"gifts\\" from her faithful supporters of Bahujan Movement started by Kanshi Ram. She paid in advance tax in April‚ÄìDecember 2007. When BSP workers garlanded Mayawati with currency notes on the occasion of the party's silver jubilee celebrations coinciding with BSP founder Kanshi Ram's birth anniversary on 15 March 2010, Indian news channels and newspapers purported to expose the event as a ‚Äòscandal‚Äô on the presumption that the Chief Minister had publicly committed an act of corruption that was being flaunted openly and declaring that the garland of currency notes was made from money through corrupt means and not from donations of Bahujan Samaj Party supporters as Mayawati, her Ministers and supporters claimed. At Kanshi Ram's funeral ceremonies in 2006, Mayawati stated that both Kanshi Ram and herself had been, and she would continue to be, observant of Buddhist traditions and customs. She has stated her intention to formally convert to Buddhism when the political conditions enable her to become Prime Minister of India. Her act of performing the last rites (traditionally done by a male heir) was an expression of their views against gender discrimination. When she was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, she publicly called Bhikkhus to prayer.  Literature about Mayawati  Literature about Mayawati includes studies and books. One of the first works about her was journalist Mohammad Jamil Akhter's book, Iron Lady Kumari Mayawati. Her autobiographies are Mere Sangarshmai Jeevan Evam Bahujan Movement Ka Safarnama in three volumes in Hindi and A Travelogue of My Struggle-ridden Life and of Bahujan Samaj, in two volumes in English. Behenji : A Political Biography of Mayawati is a biography by veteran journalist Ajoy Bose. There is news that Bollywood will release new biopic about Mayawati, where Vidya Balan will play lead role.  Awards and recognition  In 2003, Mayawati as the Chief Minister, was awarded with Paul Harris Fellow Award by UNICEF, World Health Organization and Rotary International, for her initiative in Polio eradication. Mayawati was also honoured with Rajarshi Shahu Award by Rajarshi Shahu Memorial Trust. In 2008, Forbes added Mayawati in the 59th place on its list of the 100 most powerful women in the world. She appeared in Newsweeks top woman achievers list in 2007. In 2009 a Newsweek article described her as the Barack Obama of India, and a potential candidate for Prime Minister. Time magazine included Mayawati in India's 15 Most Influential list for 2007.

The film follows Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni), a journalist writing for gossip magazines, over seven days and nights on his journey through the \\"sweet life\\" of Rome in a fruitless search for love and happiness. The screenplay, co-written by Fellini and three other screenwriters, can be divided into a prologue, seven major episodes interrupted by an intermezzo, and an epilogue, according to the most common interpretation. La Dolce Vita won the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival and the Oscar for Best Costumes.Pettigrew, 169 The film was a worldwide box-office success and a critical success, and is now frequently regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema. Plot By the most common interpretation of the storyline,Cf. Bondanella 1994, p. 143 and Kezich, p. 203 the film can be divided into a prologue, seven major episodes interrupted by an intermezzo, and an epilogue (see also Structure, below). If the evenings of each episode were joined with the morning of the respective preceding episode together as a day, they would form seven consecutive days, which may not necessarily be the case. =Prologue= 1st Day Sequence: A helicopter transports a statue of Christ over an ancient Roman aqueduct outside Rome while a second, Marcello Rubini's news helicopter, follows it into the city. The news helicopter is momentarily sidetracked by a group of bikini-clad women sunbathing on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building. Hovering above, Marcello uses gestures to elicit phone numbers from them but fails in his attempt, then shrugs and continues following the statue to Saint Peter's Square. =Episode 1= 1st Night Sequence: Marcello meets Maddalena by chance in an exclusive nightclub. A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Maddalena is tired of Rome and constantly in search of new sensations while Marcello finds Rome suits him as a jungle he can hide in. They make love in the bedroom of a prostitute to whom they had given a ride home in Maddalena's Cadillac. 1st Dawn Sequence: Marcello returns to his apartment at dawn to find that his fianc√©e, Emma, has overdosed. On the way to the hospital, he declares his everlasting love to her and again as she lies in a semiconscious state in the emergency room. While waiting frantically for her recovery, however, he tries to make a phone call to Maddalena. =Episode 2= 2nd Day Sequence: That day, he goes on assignment for the arrival of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at Ciampino airport where she is met by a horde of news reporters. During Sylvia's press conference, Marcello calls home to ensure Emma has taken her medication while reassuring her that he is not alone with Sylvia. After the film star confidently replies to the barrage of journalists' questions, her boyfriend Robert (Lex Barker) enters the room late and drunk. To Sylvia's producer, Marcello casually recommends that Sylvia be taken on a tour of St Peter's. Inside St Peter's dome, a news reporter complains that Sylvia is \\"an elevator\\" because none of them can match her energetic climb up the numerous flights of stairs. Inspired, Marcello maneuvers forward to be alone with her when they finally reach the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square. 2nd Night Sequence: That evening, the infatuated Marcello dances with Sylvia in the Baths of Caracalla. Sylvia's natural sensuality triggers raucous partying while Robert, her bored fianc√©, draws caricatures and reads a newspaper. His humiliating remark to her causes Sylvia to leave the group, eagerly followed by Marcello and his paparazzi colleagues. Finding themselves alone, Marcello and Sylvia spend the rest of the evening in the alleys of Rome where they wade into the Trevi Fountain. 2nd Dawn Sequence: Like a magic spell that has suddenly been broken, dawn arrives at the very moment Sylvia playfully \\"anoints\\" Marcello's head with fountain water. They drive back to Sylvia's hotel to find an enraged Robert waiting for her in his car. Robert slaps Sylvia, orders her to go to bed, and then assaults Marcello, who takes it in his stride. =Episode 3a= 3rd Day Sequence: Marcello meets Steiner, his distinguished intellectual friend, inside a church playing Bach on the organ. Steiner shows off his book of Sanskrit grammar. The two continue playing the organ, even offering up some jazz pieces for the watching priest. =Episode 4= 3rd Day Sequence: Late afternoon, Marcello, his photographer friend Paparazzo, and Emma drive to the outskirts of Rome to cover the story of the purported sighting of the Madonna by two children. Although the Catholic Church is officially skeptical, a huge crowd of devotees and reporters gathers at the site. 3rd Night Sequence: That night, the event is broadcast over Italian radio and television. Blindly following the two children from corner to corner in a downpour, the crowd tears a small tree apart for its branches and leaves said to have sheltered the Madonna. Meanwhile, Emma prays to the Virgin Mary to be given sole possession of Marcello's heart. 3rd Dawn Sequence: The gathering ends at dawn with the crowd mourning a sick child, a pilgrim brought by his mother to be healed, but trampled to death in the melee. =Episode 3b= 4th Night Sequence: One evening, Marcello and Emma attend a gathering at Steiner's luxurious home where they are introduced to a group of intellectuals who recite poetry, strum the guitar, offer philosophical ideas, and listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape. An American woman, whose poetry Marcello has read and admired, recommends that Marcello avoid the \\"prisons\\" of commitment: \\"Stay free, available, like me. Never get married. Never choose. Even in love, it's better to be chosen.\\" Emma appears enchanted with Steiner's home and children, telling Marcello that one day he will have a home like Steiner's, but he turns away moodily. Outside on the terrace, Marcello confesses to Steiner his admiration for all he stands for, but Steiner admits he is torn between the security that a materialistic life affords and his longing for a more spiritual albeit insecure way of life. Steiner philosophizes about the need for love in the world and fears what his children may grow up to face one day. =Intermezzo= 5th Day Sequence: Marcello spends the afternoon working on his novel at a seaside restaurant where he meets Paola, a young waitress from Perugia playing Perez Prado's cha- cha ‚ÄúPatricia‚Äù on the jukebox and then humming its tune. He asks her if she has a boyfriend, then describes her as an angel in Umbrian paintings. =Episode 5= 5th Night Sequence: Marcello meets his father (Annibale Ninchi) visiting Rome on the Via Veneto. With Paparazzo, they go to the \\"Cha- Cha\\" Club where Marcello introduces his father to Fanny, a beautiful dancer and one of his past girlfriends (he had promised to get her picture in the paper, but failed to do it). Fanny takes a liking to his father. Marcello tells Paparazzo that as a child he had never seen much of his father, who would spend weeks away from home. Fanny invites Marcello's father back to her flat, and two other dancers invite the two younger men to go with them. Marcello leaves the others when they get to the dancers' neighborhood. Fanny comes out of her house, upset that Marcello's father has become ill. 4th Dawn Sequence: Marcello's father has suffered what seems to be a mild heart attack. Marcello wants him to stay with him in Rome so they can get to know each other, but his father, weakened, wants to go home and gets in a taxi to catch the first train home. He leaves Marcello forlorn, on the street, watching the taxi leave. =Episode 6= 6th Night Sequence: Marcello, Nico, and other friends meet on the Via Veneto are driven to a castle owned by aristocrats at Bassano di Sutri outside Rome. There is already a party long in progress, and the party-goers are bleary-eyed and intoxicated. By chance, Marcello meets Maddalena again. The two of them explore a suite of ruins annexed to the castle. Maddalena seats Marcello in a vast room and then closets herself in another room connected by an echo chamber. As a disembodied voice, Maddalena asks him to marry her; Marcello professes his love for her, avoiding answering her proposal. Another man kisses and embraces Maddalena, who loses interest in Marcello. He rejoins the group, and eventually spends the night with Jane, an American artist and heiress. 5th Dawn Sequence: Burnt out and bleary-eyed, the group returns at dawn to the main section of the castle, to be met by the matriarch of the castle, who is on her way to mass, accompanied by priests in a procession. =Episode 3c= 7th Night Sequence: Marcello and Emma are alone in his sports car on an isolated road. Emma starts an argument by professing her love, and tries to get out of the car; Marcello pleads with her not to get out. Emma says that Marcello will never find another woman who loves him the way she does. Marcello becomes enraged, telling her that he cannot live with her smothering, maternal love. He now wants her to get out of the car, but she refuses. With some violence (a bite from her and a slap from him), he throws her out of the car and drives off, leaving her alone on a deserted road at night. Hours later, Emma hears his car returning as she picks flowers by the roadside. She gets into the car with neither of them saying a word. 6th Dawn Sequence: Marcello and Emma are asleep in bed, tenderly intertwined; Marcello receives a phone call. He rushes to the Steiners' apartment and learns that Steiner has killed his two children and himself. 6th Day Sequence: After waiting with the police for Steiner's wife to return home, he meets her outside to break the terrible news while paparazzi swarm around her snapping pictures. =Episode 7= 8th Night Sequence: An unspecified amount of time later, an older Marcello‚Äînow with gray in his hair‚Äîand a group of partygoers break into a Fregene beach house owned by Riccardo, a friend of Marcello's. Many of the men are homosexual. To celebrate her recent divorce from Riccardo, Nadia performs a striptease to Perez Prado's cha-cha ‚ÄúPatricia‚Äù. The drunken Marcello attempts to provoke the other partygoers into an orgy. However, their inebriation causes the party to descend into mayhem with Marcello throwing pillow feathers around the room as he rides a young woman crawling on her hands and knees. Riccardo shows up at the house and angrily tells the partiers to leave. =Epilogue= 7th Dawn Sequence: The party proceeds to the beach at dawn where they find a modern-day leviathan, a bloated, sea ray-like creature, caught in the fishermen's nets. In his stupor, Marcello comments on how its eyes stare even in death. 7th Day Sequence: Paola, the adolescent waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary but the words they exchange are lost on the wind, drowned out by the crash of the waves. He signals his inability to understand what she is saying or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.

Brunello Rondi, Fellini's co-screenwriter and long-time collaborator, confirmed this view explaining that \\"the fashion of women's sack dresses which possessed that sense of luxurious butterflying out around a body that might be physically beautiful but not morally so; these sack dresses struck Fellini because they rendered a woman very gorgeous who could, instead, be a skeleton of squalor and solitude inside.\\"Bondanella, Peter, The Cinema of Federico Fellini, 134 =Writing= Credit for the creation of Steiner, the intellectual who commits suicide after shooting his two children, goes to co- screenwriter Tullio Pinelli. Having gone to school with Italian novelist Cesare Pavese, Pinelli had closely followed the writer's career and felt that his over-intellectualism had become emotionally sterile, leading to his suicide in a Turin hotel in 1950.Kezich, 198 This idea of a \\"burnt-out existence\\" is carried over to Steiner in the party episode where the sounds of nature are not to be experienced first-hand by himself and his guests but in the virtual world of tape recordings. The ‚Äúfalse miracle‚Äù alludes to the 1958 investigation discounting the claims of two children to have been visited by the Madonna in a farm at Maratta Alta, near Terni.G. Bertelli, Divi e paparazzi: la dolce vita di Fellini (Genoa: Le mani, 2009), p34 The \\"dead sea monster\\" alludes to the Montesi affair, in which the dead body of 21 year old Wilma Montesi was discovered on a beach in April 1953.Stephen Gundle, Death and the Dolce Vita: The Dark Side of Rome in the 1950s (Canongate Books, 2012). Karen Pinkus, The Montesi Scandal: The Death of Wilma Montesi and the Birth of the Paparazzi in Fellini's Rome (University of Chicago Press, 2003) =Filming= Most of the film was shot at the Cinecitt√† Studios in Rome. Set designer Piero Gherardi created over eighty locations, including the Via Veneto, the dome of Saint Peter's with the staircase leading up to it, and various nightclubs.Fellini, 67-83. However, other sequences were shot on location such as the party at the aristocrats' castle filmed in the real Bassano di Sutri palace north of Rome. (Some of the servants, waiters, and guests were played by real aristocrats.) Fellini combined constructed sets with location shots, depending on script requirements‚Äîa real location often \\"gave birth to the modified scene and, consequently, the newly constructed set.\\"Bondanella, The Cinema of Federico Fellini, 142 The film's last scenes where the monster fish is pulled out of the sea and Marcello waves goodbye to Paola (the teenage \\"Umbrian angel\\") were shot on location at Passo Oscuro, a small resort town situated on the Italian coast 30 kilometers from Rome. Fellini scrapped a major sequence that would have involved the relationship of Marcello with Dolores, an older writer living in a tower, to be played by 1930s Academy Award-winning actress Luise Rainer.Kezich, 199 If the director's dealings with Rainer \\"who used to involve Fellini in futile discussion\\" were problematic, biographer Kezich argues that while rewriting the screenplay, the Dolores character grew \\"hyperbolic\\" and Fellini decided to jettison \\"the entire story line.\\"Kezich, 199, 241 The scene in the Trevi Fountain was shot over a week in winter: in March according to the BBC, in late January according to Anita Ekberg.Interview with Anita Ekberg by Roberta Licurgo included in 2004 DVD edition of La Dolce Vita. Fellini claimed that Ekberg stood in the cold water in her dress for hours without any trouble while Mastroianni had to wear a wetsuit beneath his clothes - to no avail. It was only after the actor \\"polished off a bottle of vodka\\" and \\"was completely pissed\\" that Fellini could shoot the scene.Costantini, 47 Paparazzo The character of Paparazzo, the news photographer (Walter Santesso), was inspired by photojournalist Tazio Secchiaroli and is the origin of the word paparazzi, used in many languages to describe intrusive photographers. As to the origin of the character's name itself, Fellini scholar Peter Bondanella argues that although \\"it is indeed an Italian family name, the word is probably a corruption of the word papataceo, a large and bothersome mosquito. Ennio Flaiano, the film's co-screenwriter and creator of Paparazzo, reports that he took the name from a character in a novel by George Gissing.\\"Bondanella, The Cinema of Federico Fellini, 136 Gissing's character, Signor Paparazzo, is found in his travel book, By the Ionian Sea (1901). Themes, motifs and structure Marcello is a journalist in Rome during the late 1950s who covers tabloid news of movie stars, religious visions and the self-indulgent aristocracy while searching for a more meaningful way of life. Marcello faces the existential struggle of having to choose between two lives, depicted by journalism and literature. Marcello leads a lifestyle of excess, fame and pleasure amongst Rome's thriving popular culture, depicting the confusion and frequency with which Marcello gets distracted by women and power. A more sensitive Marcello aspires to become a writer, of leading an intellectual life amongst the elites, the poets, writers and philosophers of the time. Marcello eventually chooses neither journalism, nor literature. Thematically he opted for the life of excess and popularity by officially becoming a publicity agent. The theme of the film \\"is predominantly caf√© society, the diverse and glittery world rebuilt upon the ruins and poverty\\" of the Italian postwar period. In the opening sequence, a plaster statue of Jesus the Labourer suspended by cables from a helicopter, flies past the ruins of an ancient Roman aqueduct. The statue is being taken to the Pope at the Vatican. Journalist Marcello and a photographer named Paparazzo follow in a second helicopter. The symbolism of Jesus, arms outstretched as if blessing all of Rome as it flies overhead, is soon replaced by the profane life and neo-modern architecture of the \\"new\\" Rome, founded on the economic miracle of the late 1950s. (Much of this was filmed in Cinecitt√† or in EUR, the Mussolini-style area south of Rome.) The delivery of the statue is the first of many scenes placing religious icons in the midst of characters demonstrating their \\"modern\\" morality, influenced by the booming economy and the emerging mass- consumer life. =Seven episodes= The most common interpretation of the film is a mosaic, its parts linked by the protagonist, Marcello Rubini, a journalist.Bondanella, The Cinema of Federico Fellini, 143 The seven episodes are: # Marcello's evening with the heiress Maddalena (Anouk Aim√©e) # His long, frustrating night with the American actress Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) that ends in the Trevi fountain at dawn # His reunion with the intellectual Steiner (Alain Cuny) their relationship is divided into three sequences spread over the film: a) the encounter, b) Steiner's party and c) Steiner's tragedy # The fake miracle # His father's visit/Steiner's Party # The aristocrat's party/Steiner's tragedy # The \\"orgy\\" at the beach house\\"At a villa on the coast near Fregene, Marcello presides over what passed for an \\"orgy\\" in 1959.\\" Bondanella, 144 Interrupting the seven episodes is the restaurant sequence with the angelic Paola; they are framed by a prologue (Jesus over Rome) and epilogue (the monster fish) giving the film its innovative and symmetrically symbolic structure. The evocations are: seven deadly sins, seven sacraments, seven virtues, seven days of creation. Other critics disagree, Peter Bondanella argues that \\"any critic of La Dolce Vita not mesmerized by the magic number seven will find it almost impossible to organize the numerous sequences on a strictly numerological basis\\".Bondanella, The Cinema of Federico Fellini, 145 =An aesthetic of disparity= The critic Robert Richardson suggests that the originality of La Dolce Vita lies in a new form of film narrative that mines \\"an aesthetic of disparity\\".Richardson, Robert, 'Waste Lands: The Breakdown of Order' in Bondanella (ed.), Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism, 111 Abandoning traditional plot and conventional \\"character development\\", Fellini and co-screenwriters Ennio Flaiano and Tullio Pinelli forged a cinematic narrative that rejected continuity, unnecessary explanations and narrative logic in favour of seven non-linear encounters between Marcello, a kind of Dantesque Pilgrim and an underworld of 120 characters. The encounters build up a cumulative impression on the viewer that finds resolution in an \\"overpowering sense of the disparity between what life has been or could be, and what it actually is\\".Richardson, 'Waste Lands: The Breakdown of Order', 111. In a device used earlier in his films, Fellini orders the disparate succession of sequences as movements from evening to dawn. Also employed as an ordering device is the image of a downward spiral that Marcello sets in motion when descending the first of several staircases (including ladders) that open and close episodes. The upshot is that the film's aesthetic form, rather than its content, embodies the theme of Rome as a moral wasteland. Critical reception Writing for L'Espresso, the Italian novelist Alberto Moravia highlighted the film's variations in tone, In Filmcritica XI, Italian poet and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini argued that \\"La Dolce Vita was too important to be discussed as one would normally discuss a film. Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, film critic and co-founder of Cahiers du cin√©ma, felt that The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther praised Fellini‚Äôs Roger Ebert considered La Dolce Vita as Fellini‚Äôs best film, as well as his favorite film of all time and listed it consistently in his top ten films for the Sight & Sound Greatest Films poll every ten years. Ebert's first review for the film, written on October 4, 1961, was the first film review he wrote, before he started his career as a film critic in 1967. The film was also a touchstone for Ebert, in how his perspective of the movie and his life changes as time passes by, giving this summation in his 1997 Great Movie review Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that from 65 reviews, 95% were positive; the consensus states: \\"An epic, breathtakingly stylish cinematic landmark, La Dolce Vita remains riveting in spite of‚Äîor perhaps because of‚Äîits sprawling length\\". On Metacritic, the film has a 95/100 rating based on 13 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". =Box office= The film was a big hit in Europe with 13,617,148 admissions in Italy and 2,956,094 admissions in France. The film had the second most admissions for an Italian film behind War and Peace and was one of the top 10 most watched films in Italy. The film earned $6 million in rentals in the United States and Canada in its original release and was the highest-grossing foreign language film at the US box office. The film was re-released in North America in 1966 by American International Pictures and earned $1.5 million in rentals. The total gross was $19,516,348. =Censorship= Perceived by the Catholic Church as a parody of the second coming of Jesus, the opening scene and the film were condemned by the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano in 1960.Kezich, 209 Subject to widespread censorship, the film was banned in Spain, until the death of Franco in 1975. Umberto Tupini, the Minister of Culture of the Tambroni government censored it and other \\"shameful films\\". In Portugal, the film took ten years to pass through its censors and be released in the country (this was due to the censorship that the country suffered during the years of Estado Novo). =Awards and recognition= The New York Times described La Dolce Vita as \\"one of the most widely seen and acclaimed European movies of the 1960s\\". It was nominated for four Academy Awards, and won one for Best Costume Design: Black-and-White. La Dolce Vita also earned the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Entertainment Weekly voted it the 6th Greatest film of all time. In 2010, the film was ranked #11 in Empire magazine's \\"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\\". In popular culture * One of the characters, Paparazzo, is the inspiration for the popular metonym \\"paparazzi\\", a word for intrusive photojournalists. *Tot√≤, Peppino e... la dolce vita is a 1961 Italian film parodying Fellini's and shot in the same sets. * In \\"Take Her, She's Mine\\" 1963 Sandra Dee imagines being romanced by a handsome man in Paris, inexplictly she has a small white kitten balanced on her head, obviously referencing the action of Anita Ekberg. * The movie Divorce Italian Style (1961) has the townspeople attend a screening of La Dolce Vita, while the main character (also played by Marcello Mastroianni) sneaks off to surprise his wife in flagrante. * Tributes to Fellini in the \\"Director's Cut\\" of Cinema Paradiso (1988) include a helicopter suspending a statue of Jesus over the city and scenes in which the Trevi Fountain is used as a backdrop while Toto, the main character, grows up to be a famous film director. * Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998) is a New York‚Äìset re-working of La Dolce Vita with Kenneth Branagh taking up Mastroianni's role and Winona Ryder and Charlize Theron taking on the roles of Anouk Aim√©e and Anita Ekberg, respectively. * In Sofia Coppola's film Lost in Translation (2003), Kelly's interview for LIT resembles Sylvia's interview scenes in La Dolce Vita. Charlotte and Bob later meet in the middle of the night and watch the famous Trevi Fountain sequence while drinking sake. Coppola said, \\"I saw that movie on TV when I was in Japan. It's not plot-driven, it's about them wandering around. And there was something with the Japanese subtitles and them speaking Italian‚Äîit had a truly enchanting quality\\". * The Italian film The Great Beauty (2013) features a former writer who wanders through the parties of the Roman high society trying to decide what to do with his life. * The first hit single from Marina and the Diamonds third album Froot mentions the line \\"living la dolce vita\\" as a reference to the movie. * The 2019 Ferrari Roma use the slogan \\"la nuova Dolce Vista\\" as a reference to the movie.

Life Zachow probably received his training from his father, the piper Heinrich Zachow, one of Leipzig's town musicians in the Alta capella, and maybe from Johann Schelle, a leading German composer, when the family moved to Eilenburg.Zachow, Friedrich Wilhelm As Kantor and organist of Halle's Market Church in 1684 he succeeded Samuel Ebart. During his time at Halle he became particularly renowned as a composer of dramatic cantatas. In 1695 he was criticized by the pietists because of his excessive long and elaborate music, that could be only appreciated by cantors and organists.Stanley Sadie, Anthony Hicks: Handel: tercentenary collection Zachow was influenced by Johann Theile in Merseburg and the poetry of Erdmann Neumeister, pastor in the nearby Weissenfels, and his criticism on pietism. Zachow was the teacher of Gottfried Kirchhoff, Johann Philipp Krieger and Johann Gotthilf Ziegler, but is best remembered as George Frideric Handel's first music teacher. He taught Handel how to play the violin, organ, harpsichord, and oboe as well as counterpoint. Zachow's teaching was so effective, that in 1702 at the age of seventeen, Handel accepted a position as organist at the former Dom in Halle. It is said that after Zachow died in 1712, Handel became a benefactor to his widow and children in gratitude for his teacher's instruction.Marcel Bijlo (2010) Zachow and his cantatas in libretto of Quintone recording. In 1713 J.S. Bach was invited as Zachow's successor. Handel continued to use Zachow's compositions in his own works, not simply quoting, but also in terms of instrumental colour; for example the cantata Herr, wenn ich nur dich habe, which is unique in having a harp solo in the German cantata repertoire, was copied by Handel, taken to London, and may have influenced the instrumentation of Saul and Esther.

It was formed in 1847 by the union of the United Secession Church and the Relief Church, and in 1900 merged with the Free Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland, which in turn united with the Church of Scotland in 1929. For most of its existence the United Presbyterian Church was the third largest Presbyterian Church in Scotland, and stood on the liberal wing of Scots Presbyterianism. The Church's name was often abbreviated to the initials U.P. United Secession Church It was founded in 1820 by a union of various churches which had seceded from the established Church of Scotland. The First Secession had been in 1732, and the resultant \\"Associate Presbytery\\" grew to include 45 congregations. A series of disputes, in 1747 over the burgesses oath, and in the late 18th century over the Westminster confession, led to further splits, but in 1820 two of the groups united to form the \\"United Associate Synod of the Secession Church\\", also known as the United Secession Church. The Relief Church The Presbytery of Relief was constituted in 1761 by three ministers of the Church of Scotland, one of whom was Thomas Gillespie, who had been deposed by the assembly in 1752 for refusing to take part in the intrusion of unacceptable ministers. The number of congregations under its charge increased with considerable rapidity, and a Relief Synod was formed in 1773, which in 1847 had under its jurisdiction 136 congregations. The Relief Church issued no distinctive testimonies, and a certain breadth of view was shown in the formal declaration of their terms of communion, first made in 1773, which allowed occasional communion with those of the Episcopal and Independent persuasion. In 1794 the Relief Church adopted as its hymn-book Patrick Hutchison's Sacred Songs and Hymns on Various Passages of Scripture, and it was Hutchison who established the first systematic definition of the Relief Church's beliefs. A Relief theological hall was instituted in 1824. The union In 1847 a union formed between all the congregations of the United Secession Church and 118 out of 136 of the Relief Churches, in what then became the United Presbyterian Church. It was the first Presbyterian body to relax the stringency of subscription, the Church Synod passing a declaratory act on the subject in 1879. On such points as that of the six days' creation, it was made clear that freedom was allowed; but when Mr David Macrae of Gourock claimed that it should also be allowed on the question of eternal punishment, he was at once declared to be no longer a minister of the church. He left behind him many who sympathized with his position, and in the remaining part of the 19th century the United Presbyterian Church came fully to share the forward movement of thought of the other Scottish churches. Doctrinally, little distinguished the United Presbyterian Church and the Free Church of Scotland, and between 1863 and 1873 negotiations took place on a union, which however proved fruitless. But in 1896 the United Presbyterian Church again made advances, which were promptly met, and on 31 October 1900 the United Free Church of Scotland came into existence. Timeline showing the evolution of the churches of Scotland from 1560 The final Moderator (1899/1900) of the Church was Very Rev Alexander Mair (1834-1911). Church buildings Paisley. The United Presbyterian Church constructed a number of notable buildings, the largest of which often used a neoclassical design with a portico. A particularly fine example is Wellington Church, near the University of Glasgow, which was built in 1883-4 by the architect Thomas Lennox Watson. This preference for neoclassical architecture contrasts strongly with the prevailing mid-Victorian taste for Gothic Revival in most of the other Scottish churches. Most U.P. churches were, however, far more modestly built than Wellington. The famous architect Alexander \\"Greek\\" Thomson (1817-1875) designed three striking U.P. church buildings in Glasgow at Caledonia Road (1856), St Vincent Street Church (1859), and Queen's Park (1867). Of the three only St. Vincent Street survives intact, Caledonia Road being an empty shell and Queen's Park destroyed by World War II bombing. Alexander Thomson was a devout Christian and a member of the United Presbyterian Church. His architectural style was often eclectic; it cannot be described as truly neoclassical (he never managed to visit Greece), but he frequently used Egyptian and other Middle Eastern motifs. His interior designs and colour schemes for churches were strongly influenced by Biblical descriptions of King Solomon's Temple, for example the reference to pomegranates in 2 Chronicles 4:13 and the furnishings mentioned in 1 Kings 6:15-36.

Early life and education Born in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, John Tupper Saywell was born on April 3, 1929, to parents John Ferdinand Tupper Saywell and Vera Marguerite Saywell. Upon the birth of his younger brother William G. Saywell, the family moved to British Columbia in 1937. His father had received a job position to become Lake Cowichan first high school principal. Saywell received his B.A. and M.A. from the University of British Columbia and his Ph.D. from Harvard University. Career He taught at the University of Toronto from 1954 to 1962. He joined York University in 1963 and was Dean of Arts at York from 1963 to 1973. Saywell retired from all teaching responsibility at York University in 1999.  Work as Historian  Saywell was the editor of two journals: Canadian Historical Review, from 1957 to 1963; and Canadian Annual Review from 1960 to 1979. Among his books were The Office of Lieutenant- Governor: A Study in Canadian Government and Politics, which won the Delancey K. Jay Prize at Harvard University. Just Call Me Mitch: The Life of Mitchell F. Hepburn, published in 1991, won the Floyd Chalmers Award for the best book on Ontario history. His 2002 study of the Supreme Court of Canada, titled The Lawmakers: Judicial Power and the Shaping of Canadian Federalism, won the John W. Dafoe Prize for \\"distinguished writing on Canada and/or Canada‚Äôs place in the world.\\" He also interpreted Canadian, British and European history for thousands of high-school students across Ontario through close to a dozen textbooks with his friend John Ricker.  Legacy  The John T.

The MVP recognition lasts for a year and is awarded for a person's Microsoft related activity, contributions and influence over the previous year.Microsoft The MVP program grew out of the software developer community. Some of the earliest MVPs were those most active in online peer support communities, such as Usenet and CompuServe. It has since grown to include other types of products, and other avenues of contribution. Steve Ballmer spoke to a group of Microsoft MVPs about Windows XP and Windows Vista. A posting from Tamar Granor on the Universal Thread web site gives this account of the origin of the MVP program. Earning the Microsoft MVP Award The rules and guidelines to getting awarded as a Microsoft MVP are not strictly defined. The reason for this is that every Microsoft MVP contributes to the community in different ways. However, the largest key indicator Microsoft looks for when considering someone for the Microsoft MVP Award is how much impact their activities over the last 12 months have on the community. Cancellation and reinstatement On October 22, 1999, a Microsoft executive sent out a message announcing the cancellation of the MVP program. This may have been in response to a recent suit against AOL by its newsgroup leaders, who felt that they deserved to be paid for the time they put in online. After an outpouring of online support to the MVP program, including many emails sent directly to Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, Microsoft announced three days later that the cancellation had been rescinded. This then led to discussions across the company about which division would own the expenses for this program. The program stayed in support, but additional investments were made - one of the original CompuServe engineers was brought in for a new position as Director of Community, reinvigorating the MVP program with a dedicated project coordinator, site resources and support engineers. The program became far more successful through these efforts, expanding its global footprint and receiving coverage with more than 100 independent press articles, eventually landing as one of Microsoft's Board of Director's 7 Big Bets for 2007. Locating an MVP With the introduction of a site dedicated to MVPs, it is now easier to locate an MVP from a specific country and from a specific area of expertise. The need to contact an MVP can be user specific. The most common purpose is for students enrolled in Microsoft Student Partnership (MSP) programs. The 2011 update to the program now allows MSP students to contact MVPs directly for training purposes. This is subject to the availability and acceptance of the MVP whom the MSP student contacts. Among other purposes, the MVP might be contacted to get assistance with local and assembled devices running Microsoft products. Anyone can use the Advanced Search on the Microsoft MVP website to locate MVP awardees by location and/or by expertise. Microsoft Community was a website that engaged in connecting users with experts of different types ‚Äì including Microsoft MVPs. Users can send a personal message or contact an MVP on a forum as per the availability of the MVP. The concept of Microsoft Community was to provide unofficial support to its users and is something like Windows Live QnA. The forum site deals with almost all products and hence users can expect MVPs from almost all areas of expertise there. Windows Community is a Microsoft featured community that deals primarily with assistance and information on Microsoft Windows Operating System and related applications plus news. People can find an MVP from different areas and expertise on the Authors page of the Windows Community. The site, however, lacks a list of MVP awardees that can make it easier for people to locate area and location specific Microsoft experts. Separate from Microsoft's MVP program, a few current and previous MVPs maintained the MVPS.org web site and mail hosting service. This site was for the use of any individual granted MVP status by Microsoft, and provided a platform for continuing their MVP work through technical sites in a variety of Microsoft applications and technologies. MVPS.org was in no way associated with, funded by or governed by Microsoft. The listing of MVP web sites, the hosting of those sites, and MVPS.org email addresses were provided to MVPs strictly upon request by MVPs to the MVPs.org admins after their profile has been published by the Microsoft MVP program. The names on MVPS.org represents only a small subsection of MVP awardees since 1995, and is not intended to be a definitive listing of current and past award recipients.

What it means by ‚Äòthe number of people neither grows nor declines‚Äô is that births plus in-migrants equal deaths plus out- migrants.Haupt, Arthur, and Thomas Kane (1991) \\"The Population Reference Bureau's Population Handbook\\", 3d ed. Washington, D.C.: Population Reference Bureau History A loosely defined goal of ZPG is to match the replacement fertility rate, which is the average number of children per woman which would hold the population constant. This replacement fertility will depend on mortality rates and the sex ratio at birth, and varies from around 2.1 in developed countries to over 3.0 in some developing countries.Espenshade, Thomas J.; Guzman, Juan Carlos and Westoff, Charles F. \\"The Surprising Global Variation in Replacement Fertility\\", Population Research and Policy Review, Vol.22, No. 5-6, Dec. 2003, pp. 575-583. The American sociologist and demographer Kingsley Davis is credited with coining the term but it was used earlier by George J. Stolnitz, who stated that the concept of a stationary population dated back to 1693. A mathematical description was given by James Mirrlees. In the late 1960s ZPG became a prominent political movement in the U.S. and parts of Europe, with strong links to environmentalism and feminism. Yale University was a stronghold of the ZPG activists who believed ‚Äúthat a constantly increasing population is responsible for many of our problems: pollution, violence, loss of values and of individual privacy.‚Äù‚ÄúZPG ‚Äì A New Movement Challenges the U.S. to Stop Growing‚Äù, LIFE magazine, April 27, 1970, page 12ff Founding fathers of the movement were Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, Richard Bowers, a Connecticut lawyer, and Professor Charles Lee Remington. Ehrlich stated: ‚ÄúThe mother of the year should be a sterilized woman with two adopted children.‚Äù Effects In the long term, zero population growth can be achieved when the birth rate of a population equals the death rate, i.e. fertility is at replacement level and birth and death rates are stable, a condition also called demographic equilibrium. Unstable rates can lead to drastic changes in population levels. This analysis is valid for the planet as a whole (assuming that interplanetary travel remains at zero or negligible levels), but not necessarily for a region or country as it ignores migration. A population that has been growing in the past will have a higher proportion of young people. As it is younger people who have children, there is large time lag between the point at which the fertility rate (mean total number of children each woman has during her childbearing years) falls to the replacement level (the fertility rate which would result in equal birth and death rates for a population at equilibrium) and the point at which the population stops rising. The reason for this is that even though the fertility rate has dropped to replacement level, people already continue to live for some time within a population. Therefore, equilibrium, with a static population, will not be reached until the first \\"replacement level\\" birth cohorts reach old age and die. The related calculations are complex because the population's overall death rate can vary over time, and mortality also varies with age (being highest among the old). Conversely, with fertility below replacement, a large elderly generation eventually results (as in an aging ‚Äúbaby boom‚Äù); but since that generation failed to replace itself during its fertile years, a subsequent ‚Äúpopulation bust‚Äù, or decrease in population, will occur when the older generation dies off. This effect has been termed birth dearth. In addition, if a country's fertility is at replacement level, and has been that way for at least several decades (to stabilize its age distribution), then that country's population could still experience coincident growth due to continuously increasing life expectancy, even though the population growth is likely to be smaller than it would be from natural population increase. Zero population growth is often a goal of demographic planners and environmentalists who believe that reducing population growth is essential for the health of the ecosystem. Preserving cultural traditions and ethnic diversity is a factor for not allowing human populations levels or rates to fall too low. Achieving ZPG is difficult because a country's population growth is often determined by economic factors, incidence of poverty, natural disasters, disease, etc. However, even if there is zero population growth, there may be changes in demographics of great importance to economic factors, such as changes in age distribution. How ZPG can be achieved Number of demographic experts have suggested a few ways to reach zero population growth. Biologist Alan D. Thornhill and Author Daniel Quinn argue that human population growth is a function of the human food supply and that human population growth can only be achieved by an expanded food supply to support the growing population. In 1998, they produced a video entitled \\"Food Production and Human Population Growth\\" where they explain the theory and answer audience questions. Albert Bartlett, an emeritus professor of physics at University of Colorado at Boulder in his lifetime, suggested that a population has the following choices to achieve ZPG: # Voluntarily limit births and immigration to achieve zero population growth; #Continue on the present path until the population is so large that draconian measures become necessary to stop the growth of population; #Do nothing and let nature stop the growth through disease, starvation, war, and pestilence. If humans do not solve the problem, nature will.Bartlett, Albert A. & Lytwak, Edward P. ‚ÄúZero Growth of the Population of the United States.‚Äù (http://www.albartlett.org/articles/ee_zero_growth_population_us_1995.pdf), Population and Environment, Vol.16, Issue 5, May. 1995, pp 415-428 Similarly, Jason Brent, another demographic expert, argues that there are three ways to achieve zero population growth. His argument is as follows: # By war, with or without weapons of mass destruction, starvation, disease, rape, murder, ethnic cleansing, concentration camps, and other horrors beyond the imagination, when humanity has exceeded the carrying capacity of the Earth. # By the voluntary action of all of humanity prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth. If any group or even if a single-family failed to control its population the entire program would fail. # By coercive population control prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth.Wooldbridge, Frosty (27 Feb 2013). ‚ÄúZero population growth: only way out of world population overload‚Äù (http://churchandstate.org.uk/2013/03/zero- population-growth-only-way-out/). Church and State, Retrieved 2015-04-07. In China China is the largest country by population in the world, having some 1.4 billion people. China is expected to have a zero population growth rate by 2030. China's population growth has slowed since the beginning of this century. This was mostly the result of China's economic growth and increasing living standards which led to the decline. However, many demographers also credit China's family planning policy, which was formulated in the early 1970s, encourages late marriages, late childbearing, and the use of contraceptives, and since 1980 has limited most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children. According to government projections, the work-age population will then drop to 870 million. It was said, in 2009, that the Chinese government was hoping to see zero population growth in the future but, in November 2013, a relaxation of the one-child policy was announced amid unpopularity, reduced labour pool and support for an ageing population.

Jubaland in a federal state in the south of Somalia. In November 2014, the South West State of Somalia was established as a Somali federal state. In October 2016, a formation conference was launched in order to form the Hirshabelle State as a Somali federal state. The Federal Parliament is tasked with selecting the ultimate number and boundaries of the autonomous regional states (officially, Federal Member States) within the Federal Republic of Somalia. To this end, the legislature in December 2014 passed a law establishing the Boundary and Federalization Commission. The body is mandated with determining the boundaries of the country's constituent Federal Member States, as well as arbitrating between these regional states on their respective jurisdiction.

He reportedly wrote his first covenant with God in the blood of his own veins. Gib was born in the parish of Muckhart, in southern Perthshire on 15 April 1714. He studied literature and theology at the University of Edinburgh and at Perth, and was licensed as a preacher in 1740. His eldest brother being a prodigal son, Adam succeeded to the paternal estate, but burned the will when his brother promised to reform. In 1741 he was ordained minister of the large Secession congregation of Bristo Street, Edinburgh. In 1745 he was almost the only Edinburgh minister who continued to preach against rebellion while the troops of Bonnie Prince Charlie were occupying the town. When, in 1747, the Associate Synod, by a narrow majority, decided not to give full immediate effect to a judgment which had been passed in the previous year against the lawfulness of the Burgess Oath, Gib led the protesting minority, who broke off and formed the Antiburgher Synod (10 April) in his own house in Edinburgh. It was chiefly through Gib's influence that the Antiburghers decided, at subsequent meetings, to summon to the bar their Burgher brethren, and to depose and excommunicate them for contumacy. Gib's action in forming the Antiburgher Synod led, after prolonged litigation, to his exclusion from the building in Bristo Street where his congregation had met. In 1765 he made his response to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which had stigmatized the Secession as threatening the peace of the country. From 1753 till within a short period of his death, he preached regularly in Nicolson Street Church, which was constantly filled with an audience of two thousand persons. His dogmatic and fearless attitude in controversy earned for him the nickname Pope Gib. He died on 14 June 1788 and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh on 18 June.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Caledonian Society of Scotland The grave lies on the south-facing section of the western wall within the original graveyard. He is buried with his wife Emilia MacGeorge and his daughters. Life Adam Gib was a Scottish Antiburgher divine, the ninth son of John Gib. He was born at Castletown, his father's property, in the parish of Muckhart, Perthshire, on 7 April 1714. He was educated at the university of Edinburgh. His first serious impressions were caused by his unexpectedly witnessing the execution of a criminal in the Grassmarket. While he was attending the undergraduate classes the controversy was going on in the general assembly which led to the formation of the secession church under Ebenezer Erskine and others, and Gib was so impressed with the harsh treatment of the seceders, that he threw in his lot with them. His father was at first extremely displeased with him, but was afterwards reconciled; and as his eldest son was a prodigal he settled on Adam the succession to the estate. When the will was read Adam asked his brother if he would reform, and on his promising to do so put the will into the fire. Gib joined the ‚ÄòAssociate Presbytery‚Äô founded by Erskine and others in 1735, and was licensed to the West Kirk of Stirling on 5 March 1740. In 1741 he was ordained to the charge of the important secession congregation in Bristo Street, Edinburgh. In 1745, when Edinburgh fell into the hands of the Pretender, Gib displayed characteristic courage. Most of the presbyterian ministers had fled from the city. Gib, however, withdrew with his flock only to the suburbs, and for five Sundays at Dreghorn, near Colinton, three miles from Edinburgh, where the insurgents had a guard, he fearlessly lifted up his voice against the ‚Äòpopish pretender‚Äô and his cause. He prayed with great earnestness for George II, for the preservation of the Protestant succession, and for the suppression of the unnatural and anti-Christian rebellion. The services were conducted in the open air, and among the audience were sometimes some of the Pretender's soldiers, who did not molest the preacher. Gib actually took prisoner a rebel spy a few hours before the Battle of Falkirk, and would no doubt after the battle have suffered from the vengeance of the victors, but when searched for he could not be found. About 1747 Gib entered into another species of warfare. Among the seceders a dispute had arisen about the lawfulness of an oath to be taken by burgesses or burghers. Gib took the side of those who deemed the oath unlawful, and ultimately became the leader of the antiburgher section of the secession. The antiburgher synod was constituted in his house at Edinburgh 10 April 1747. This involved him and his flock in litigation as to the property of the church in Bristo Street. With characteristic intrepidity he stuck to the building for years, after decisions had been given against him, renewing the litigation on some other point, till at last retreat became inevitable. His people built a large meeting-place for him in Nicolson Street, where, till near his death, which took place at Edinburgh on 18 June 1788, he ministered to an immense congregation, and where he was succeeded as minister by John Jamieson, the well-known author of the ‚ÄòScottish Dictionary.‚Äô All his life Gib was an active controversialist, chiefly on points involved in the position of the seceders. His one object was to maintain and defend what he considered to be the truth.

Early life Ebenezer's father, Henry Erskine, served as minister at Cornhill-on-Tweed, Northumberland, but was ejected in 1662 under the Act of Uniformity and imprisoned for several years. Ebenezer and his brother Ralph were both born during this difficult period in their father's life. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688 Henry was appointed to the parish of Chirnside, Berwickshire. In 1703, after studying at the University of Edinburgh, Ebenezer was ordained as minister of Portmoak, Kinross-shire. A year later, he married Alison Turpie. They remained in Portmoak for 28 years, until, in the autumn of 1731, he moved to the West Church, Stirling. Secession Some time before this, at the General Assembly of 1722, a group of men including Ebenezer had been rebuked and admonished for defending the doctrines contained in the book The Marrow of Modern Divinity. In 1733, a sermon he preached on lay patronage at the Synod of Perth led to new accusations being levelled against him. He was compelled to defend himself from rebuke by appealing to the General Assembly, but the Assembly supported his accusers. After fruitless attempts to obtain a hearing, he, along with William Wilson of Perth, Alexander Moncrieff of Abernethy and James Fisher of Kinclaven, was suspended from the ministry by the Commission of Assembly in November of that year. In protest against this sentence, the suspended ministers constituted themselves as a separate church court, under the name the \\"Associate Presbytery\\". In 1739 they were summoned to appear before the General Assembly, but did not attend because they did not acknowledge its authority. They were deposed by the Church of Scotland the following year. In the following years a large number of people joined their communion. The Associate Presbytery remained united until 1747, when a division took place over how the church should respond to a new oath required of all burgesses. Erskine joined with the \\"burgher\\" section, becoming their professor of theology. He continued to preach to a large and influential congregation in Stirling until his death. He was a very popular preacher and a man of considerable force of character. He was noted for acting on principle with honesty and courage. In 1820 the burgher and anti-burgher sections of the Secession Church were reunited, followed, in 1847 by their union with the relief synod as the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Influence The majority of Erskine's published works are sermons. His Life and Diary (edited by the Rev. Donald Fraser) was published in 1840. His Works were published in 1785. In the United States, part of the Associate Presbyterian Church united with most of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in 1782, forming the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. This denomination, which continues today, operates Erskine College and Seminary in Due West, South Carolina. Family His son-in-law Rev Robert Fisher (died 1775), married to his daughter Jean, was a minister in Glasgow. Free Gardener Erskine was a Free Gardener. He was Initiated in the Dunfermline Lodge of Free Gardeners in 1722 the same year as his patron, John Leslie, 8th Earl of Rothes. It is worthy of note that after he became a Free Gardener his sermons began to include numerous horticultural allusions.

The rule is also known as repetition of position and, in the USCF rules, as triple occurrence of position.Article 14K.2 in Two positions are by definition \\"the same\\" if the same types of pieces occupy the same squares, the same player has the move, the remaining castling rights are the same and the possibility to capture en passant is the same. The repeated positions need not occur in succession. The reasoning behind the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no real progress is being made and the game could hypothetically continue indefinitely. The game is not automatically drawn if a position occurs for the third time ‚Äì one of the players, on their turn, must claim the draw with the arbiter. The claim must be made either before making the move which will produce the third repetition, or after the opponent has made a move producing a third repetition. By contrast, the fivefold repetition rule requires the arbiter to intervene and declare the game drawn if the same position occurs five times, and requires no claim by the players. Similar rules exist in other abstract strategy games such as xiangqi and shogi (cf. sennichite). Statement of the rule The relevant rules in the FIDE laws of chess are summarized as: :The game is a draw if a position occurs (at least) three times during the game. (Intervening moves do not matter.) It must be claimed by the player with the turn to move. The claim is made: ::a. If the position is about to appear for the third time, the player making the claim first writes their move on their and notifies the that they intend to make this move. ::or ::b. If the position has just appeared for the third time, the player with the move can claim the draw. : Positions are considered the same if : (1) the same player has the move, : (2) pieces of the same kind and color occupy the same squares, and : (3) the possible moves of all the pieces are the same. : Under (3) above, positions are not considered to be the same if: : (a) in the first position, a pawn could have been captured en passant (by the en passant rule, in the subsequent positions, the pawn cannot be captured en passant anymore), or : (b) either player has lost a right to castle, i.e. either king or one of the rooks has been moved, in between repetitions of the position. Although a threefold repetition usually occurs after consecutive moves, there is no requirement that the moves be consecutive for a claim to be valid. The intermediate positions and moves do not matter ‚Äì they can be the same or different. The rule applies to positions, not moves. Perpetual check is related to the rule, as it leads to repetition of positions. If the claim for a draw is incorrect, the opponent is awarded an extra two minutes, the written move if being a legal move must be played and the game continues. Unreasonable claims may be penalized under rule 11.5, which forbids distracting or annoying the opponent. Even if the claim is incorrect, any draw claim is also a draw offer that the opponent may accept. The fivefold repetion rule was introduced in 2014 providing for a mandatory draw in the event of a fivefold repetion. Examples The seventeenth and eighteenth game of the 1972 World Championship match in Reykjavik between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky were declared draws because of threefold repetition. The twentieth game was drawn after an incorrect claim (see incorrect claims below). =Fischer versus Petrosian, 1971= In the third game of the 1971 Candidates Final Match in Buenos Aires between Bobby Fischer and Tigran Petrosian, Petrosian (with a better position) accidentally allowed the position after 30.Qe2 (see diagram) to be repeated three times. Play continued: : 30... Qe5 : 31. Qh5 Qf6 : 32. Qe2 (second time) Re5 : 33. Qd3 Rd5? and then Fischer wrote his next move : 34. Qe2 (third time) ¬Ω-¬Ω on his , which is the third appearance of the position with Black to move, and he claimed a draw.Different sources give different moves near the end. Plisetsky & Voronkov and Kasparov give 32...Re5 33.Qh5 Rd5. ChessGames.com and Chess Life (11/1971 and 12/1971) give 32...Re5 33.Qd3 Rd5. The December 1971 Chess Life also discusses how the intermediate moves were different, and that Petrosian seemed unaware that he was going to allow a three-fold repetition. At first Petrosian was not aware of what was going on. Incidentally, this was the first time a draw by threefold repetition had been claimed in his career , , . This also illustrates that the intermediate moves do not need to be the same ‚Äì just the positions. =Capablanca versus Lasker, 1921= As noted above, one of the players must claim a draw by threefold repetition for the rule to be applied, otherwise the game continues. In the fifth game of the 1921 World Chess Championship match in Havana between Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca and Emanuel Lasker, the same position occurred three times, but no draw was claimed. After 34...h5 (see diagram), the moves were: : 35. Qd8+ Kg7 : 36. Qg5+ Kf8 (second time) : 37. Qd8+ Kg7 : 38. Qg5+ Kf8 (third time) The game continued; Lasker blundered and resigned on move 46. Capablanca repeated the position to gain time on the clock (i.e. get in some quick moves before time control) . (Capablanca went on to win the match and became world champion.) =Two games between Alekhine and Lasker, 1914= { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\"   } The game between Alexander Alekhine and world champion Emanuel Lasker in Moscow 1914 ended in a short draw. After 16.Qg6 (see diagram) the players agreed to a draw because Alekhine can force the threefold repetition, for example 16...Qe8 17.Qxh6+ Kg8 18.Qg5+ Kh8 19.Qh6+ (under repetition of position). In the first game between the two players in the St. Petersburg tournament 1914, Alekhine, this time with the black pieces, after 21.Qd4 (see diagram), forced a draw by threefold repetition using a similar process . =Portisch versus Korchnoi, 1970= A famous draw for threefold repetition occurred in the fourth game between Lajos Portisch and Viktor Korchnoi in Belgrade in the Russia (USSR) vs Rest of the World 1970 match. After 21...Qb5 (see diagram), in a clearly better position, Portisch allowed this position to repeat three times and was criticized by teammate Bobby Fischer for allowing it . If Portisch had won the game, the match would have been a tie. Play continued: : 22.Bf1 Qc6 : 23.Bg2 Qb5 (second time) : 24.Bf1 Qc6 : 25.Bg2 ¬Ω-¬Ω allowing Black to claim the threefold repetition with 25...Qb5. =Kasparov versus Deep Blue, 1997= In the game between Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue in New York 1997, the game ended with a draw by agreement, because after 49...Kb4 (see diagram) if White plays 50.g8=Q, Black can force perpetual check and claim a draw after 54.Kb1 by threefold repetition : : 50...Rd1+ : 51.Ka2, Kb2 or Kc2 Rd2+ : 52.Kb1 (second time) Rd1+ : 53.Ka2, Kb2 or Kc2 Rd2+ : 54.Kb1 (third time) =Khamparia vs Bo, 2018= To detect fivefold repetitions can be challenging for the arbiter. In the game Akshat Khamparia vs Li Bo, Budapest 2018, Li twice requested a draw, saying simply \\"repetition\\". Both times the request was rejected because it was not made correctly according to the threefold repetition rule. Li was later checkmated. Li discussed the result and eventually said \\"five\\". The arbiter was able to verify fivefold repetition at moves 60, 62, 68, 73 and 75. Had the fivefold repetition rule not been in effect, the result would have stood, as no correct claim for threefold repetition had been made. Under the fivefold repetition rule, however, the fifth occurrence of a position immediately terminates the game, and subsequent moves become irrelevant. The result was therefore overturned, and the game was declared a draw.The PGN of the game is contained in the following FIDE rating page =Opening line= An Austrian Attack line from the Pirc Defence has been analyzed out to a draw by threefold repetition. After the moves 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3 c5 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.e5 Ng4 8.e6 fxe6 9.Ng5 Bxb5! 10.Nxe6 Bxd4! 11.Nxd8 (see diagram) Black can force perpetual check and so the draw by the following moves: : 11...Bf2+ : 12.Kd2 (first time) Be3+ : 13.Ke1 Bf2+ : 14.Kd2 (second time) Be3+ : 15.Ke1 Bf2+ : 16.Kd2 (third time) Repeating a position to gain time Players sometimes repeat a position once not in order to draw, but to gain time on the clock (when an increment is being used) or to bring themselves closer to the time control (at which point they will receive more time). Occasionally, players miscount and inadvertently repeat the position more than once, thus allowing their opponent to claim a draw in an unfavourable position. The game between Ponomariov and Adams in Wijk aan Zee 2005 may have been an example of this . Incorrect claims Even top players have made incorrect claims of a draw under this rule. The Karpov‚ÄìMiles game is an example of the right to castle having to be the same in all positions. The Fischer‚ÄìSpassky game is an example that it must be the same player's move in all three positions. =Karpov versus Miles, 1986= The clause about the right to castle is a subtle but important one. In a game between grandmasters Anatoly Karpov and Tony Miles in Tilburg 1986, Karpov had less than five minutes remaining on his clock in which to finish a specified number of moves or forfeit the game. He claimed a draw by repetition after checking his scoresheet carefully, whereupon it was pointed out to him that in the first occurrence of position, Black's king had had the right to castle, whereas in the second and third it had not. Tournament rules stipulated that a player be penalized with three minutes of their time for incorrect claims, which left Karpov's flag on the verge of falling. By then, Miles had taken the draw. (Miles should have readily accepted a draw in that position, but Karpov was close to losing the game because of time control.) After 22. Nb5 (see diagram) play continued: : 22... Ra4 (Black loses queenside castling right) : 23. Nc3 Ra8 : 24. Nb5 (first time only, Black lost queenside castling right) Ra4 : 25. Nc3 Ra8 : 26. Nb5 (second time only, Black lost queenside castling right) ¬Ω-¬Ω Black could castle the first time the position in the diagram occurred, but not when the position was repeated. =Fischer versus Spassky, 1972= In the twentieth game of the 1972 World Chess Championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky, Fischer called the Lothar Schmid to claim a draw because of threefold repetition. Spassky did not dispute it and signed the scoresheets before the arbiter ruled . After the draw had been agreed, it was pointed out that the position had occurred after White's forty-eighth (see diagram) and fiftieth moves, and again after Black's fifty-fourth move. So the claim was actually invalid because it was not the same player's turn to move in all three instances, but the draw result stood .Alexander says that it appears that the arbiter approved the draw but Gligoriƒá says that Spassky signed the scoresheet before the arbiter could rule on the claim. History of the rule The rule has been variously formulated at different times in chess history. In Tim Harding's MegaCorr database (a collection of correspondence chess games), the notes to a game between the cities of Pest and Paris played between 1842 and 1845 state that a sixfold repetition was necessary to claim a draw. The game went: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.0-0 0-0 8.c4 Be6 9.Qc2 f5 10.Qb3 dxc4 11.Qxb7 c6 12.Bxe4 fxe4 13.Ng5 Bf5 14.Nc3 Qd7 15.Qxd7 Nxd7 16.Ngxe4 Bc7 17.Re1 Rab8 18.Re2 Nb6 19.Nc5 (see diagram) Bd6 20.N5e4 Bc7 21.Nc5 Bd6 22.N5e4 Bc7 23.Nc5 Bd6 24.N5e4 Bc7 25.Nc5 Bd6 26.N5e4 Bc7 27.Nc5 and now instead of taking the sixfold repetition draw with 27...Bd6 28.N5e4 Bc7, Paris diverged with 27...Bd3 and went on to lose the game. The first use of such a rule was in a tournament in London in 1883, but was stated vaguely: \\"... if a series of moves be repeated three times the opponent can claim a draw.\\" The rules for the first official World Chess Championship 1886 match between Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort stated: \\"... if both players repeat the same series of moves six times in succession, then either player may claim a draw.\\" In two of the games the same position was repeated three times. The rule was modified soon afterward to be based on positions instead of moves, and for three repetitions . Draws by this method used to be uncommon . The first edition of the FIDE rule from 1928 already defines the threefold repetition rule without considering castling and en passant capture rights. To additionally consider castling and en passant capture rights was implicitly introduced in 1975 and explicitly worded in 1985. Prior to that, a 1964 FIDE interpretation established the same . =Pillsbury versus Burn, 1898= In this 1898 Vienna tournament game between Harry Pillsbury and Amos Burn, the same position occurred three times, but no draw could be claimed under the rules at the time. The tournament was played under the rules of Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (1843, with later editions), in which the three-fold rule was stated as the repetition of moves or a sequence of moves, not a position. After 42...Qe3 (see diagram), the game continued: : 43.Qb2 Kh6 : 44.Qc2 Kh7 : 45.Qb2 Kg8 : 46.Qc2 Kg7 (second time) : 47.Qb2 Kh7 : 48.Qc2 Kh6 : 49.Qb2 Kh7 : 50.Qc2 Kg7 (third time) : 51.Qb2 Under modern rules, Black could claim a draw by informing the arbiter of their intention to play 50...Kg7, producing the same position as had occurred after 42...Qe3 and 46...Kg7. Alternatively, after 51.Qb2, Black could claim a draw immediately because White has repeated the position after 43.Qb2 and 47.Qb2. Burn went on to win the game . Other games In many abstract strategy games there are rules to cover repetition of position. In some games this results in a draw, in others it is forbidden to repeat a position. Currently, shogi employs a fourfold repetition (ÂçÉÊó•Êâã sennichite) rule, which is required to end in a draw. Each player must have the same pieces in hand as well as the same position on the board. The result is a draw. However, a fourfold repetition with perpetual checks is illegal, and results not in a draw but in a loss by the checking player. In Xiangqi, rules about repetitions vary between different sets of rules, but generally perpetual attacks (Èï∑Êâì), including perpetual check, perpetual threatmate, and perpetual chase, are forbidden. Arimaa does not allow threefold repetition of the same position with the same player to move. In Go, a player may not make a move which repeats a previous position, as would occur if a player were to immediately recapture a stone in a ko situation. Creating ko threats is an important strategic consideration in Go.

He was born in Duns on 17 March 1676, son of John Boston (who suffered imprisonment in the cause of nonconformity) and Alison Trotter. He was educated at the Grammar School of Duns and was later employed by Alexander Cockburn, notary. He graduated with an M.A. (Edinburgh, 9 July 1694), his whole expenses at college being ¬£10, 14s. 7fd. sterling. He then became schoolmaster of Glencairn in 1695 ; res. 8 February 1696 ; was thereafter tutor to young Andrew Fletcher of Aberlady, and chaplain to his stepfather, Colonel James Bruce of Kennet ; licen. by Presb. of Duns and Chirnside 15 June 1697 ; officiated in vacant parishes in the Presb. of Stirling in 1698; ord. to Simprin 21 September 1699; clerk of Synod in 1701 ; called by the Presb. jure devoluto 24 January 1706 ; adm. 1 May 1707, the day of the Union of Scotland and England ; died 20 May 1732. He and eleven others gave in a Representation and Petition to the General Assembly of 1721 against an Act passed in the previous year condemning The Marrow of Modern Divinity. The Assembly of 1722 directed that the ministers who had signed the Representation should be rebuked by the Moderator. That was done, and a protest prepared by Boston was not received, but was subsequently printed by the protesters. Boston's own writings, together with his devout life and exemplary pastoral labours, contributed greatly to the popularity of the doctrines contained in the Marrow. His communions were attended by crowds from all parts, and he was one of the most influential figures in the Church life of his time. His theology was essentially Calvinistic. A literalism dominated his interpretation of the Scriptures, and he regarded even the Hebrew accents as divinely inspired. Life He was born at Duns. His father, John Boston, and his mother, Alison Trotter, were both Covenanters. He was educated at Edinburgh, and licensed in 1697 by the presbytery of Chirnside. In 1699 he became minister of the small parish of Simprin, where there were only 90 examinable persons; previously, he was a schoolmaster in Glencairn. In 1704 he found, while visiting a member of his flock, a book brought into Scotland by a commonwealth soldier, the Marrow of Modern Divinity, by Edward Fisher, a compendium of the opinions of leading Reformation divines on the doctrine of grace and the offer of the Gospel, which set off the Marrow Controversy. Its object was to demonstrate the unconditional freeness of the Gospel. It cleared away such conditions as repentance, or some degree of outward or inward reformation, and argued that where Christ is heartily received, full repentance and a new life follow. On Boston's recommendation, James Hog of Carnock reprinted The Marrow in 1718; and Boston also published an edition with notes of his own. The book, attacked from the standpoint of high Calvinism, became the standard of a far-reaching movement in Scottish Presbyterianism. The Marrow men were marked by the zeal of their service and the effect of their preaching. As they remained Calvinists they could not preach a universal atonement; rather they were particular redemptionists. In 1707 Boston was translated to Ettrick, Scotland. He was the only member of the assembly who entered a protest against the lightness of the sentence passed on John Simson, Professor of Divinity at Glasgow, who was accused of heterodox teaching on the Incarnation. Family life He married on 17 July 1700, Katherine (died 4 March 1737), fifth daughter of Robert Brown of Barhill, Culross, a medical practitioner, and had children ‚Äî Katharine, born 24 May 1701, died in 1702; John, chamberlain to the Duke of Buccleuch at Langholm, born 29 April 1702, died in 1757 [his son became an admiral of the British Navy; for an interesting notice of him, vide Memoir of Caroline Herschel]; Robert, born 21 March 1704, died 26 January 1705; Jane, born 1 November 1705 (married 2 December 1736, James Russell of Ashiestiel), died in 1765; Ebenezer, born 23 April 1707, died 8 September 1707; Ebenezer, born 4 August 1708, died 10 October 1708; Thomas, born 9 February 1710, died 30 April 1712; Alison, born 8 June 1711 (married James Anderson, farmer, Altrive), died in 1765; Thomas, his successor in the parish; Katharine, born 15 July 1715, died 12 March 1716. Works Boston's autobiography is a record of Scottish life. His other books include Human Nature in Its Fourfold State, one of the religious classics of Scotland; The Crook in the Lot, a short book noted for its originality; and his Body of Divinity and Miscellanies. These works had a major influence over the Scottish peasantry. Among his works is a learned treatise on Hebrew points. His Memoirs were published in 1776 (ed. George D. Low, 1908).

History The Yee Hong Centre for Geriatric Care, formerly the Chinese Community Nursing Home for Greater Toronto, came about when Dr. Joseph Wong reportedly felt that there was a lack of emotional support and difficulty in communicating for Chinese seniors within mainstream medical facilities. In 1987, Dr. Joseph Wong, gathered a group of thirty Chinese Canadian friends who shared his vision of building a nursing home through grass-root fundraising effort. The Yee Hong Centre was officially opened in October 1994. Located on a site in the heart of Scarborough's Chinese community, the first Centre at Scarborough McNicoll has a nursing home with a specialized Alzheimer's unit and long-term care facility that was honoured thrice as Grand Prize winner of the Ontario Long Term Care Association (OLTCA) Occupational Health and Safety Week Competition since 1997. The Centre includes a Seniors Community Centre which offers a number of social and daycare activities as well as community outreach, drop-in programs and meals- on-wheels. The Macrobian Club, Yee Hong's seniors social club which operates within the seniors community centre, received the Certificate of Recognition from the Board of Health of the City of Scarborough. One of the Centre's other accomplishments is the non-profit housing complex - the Aw Chan Kam Chee Evergreen Manor - featuring 130 apartments and 26 family townhouses. The Centre applied to the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation, and was awarded a three-year accreditation in June 1996, its 20th month of operation. It was awarded the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association's Award for Excellence in 1997. In 2003, it marked the third consecutive time Yee Hong has been accredited by the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation. With 155 beds at present in Scarborough McNicoll, the K.C. Poon Nursing Home is also connected to a medical centre and a rehabilitation centre. All of the Centre's staff are fluently bilingual in both English and Chinese and are familiar with the traditions of the Chinese culture. In November 1996, just two years after the Scarborough McNicoll's grand opening, an ambitious $6 million expansion campaign was launched to add two floors with 65 more beds to the existing nursing home and extra day care program space. It received funding approval for the additional long term care beds from the provincial government in 1998. The expansion was completed and the first resident, who had been on the waiting list since 1994, was admitted on June 14, 1999. In December 1999 the Council awarded another three-year accreditation to the just expanded facility. It praised Yee Hong for providing \\"stellar care\\" to elderly members of the Chinese population in Scarborough, and stated that there were no recommendations suggested to improve the facility. With the Expansion Campaign accomplished, Yee Hong has provided care to communities in other regions and to other seniors. In 1998 and 2001, the Ministry of Health awarded Yee Hong Centre a total of 715 bed licences, the largest such allocation to a non-profit organization in the history of Ontario. The Yee Hong Centre Capital Campaign was embarked upon in April 1999 to build three new Yee Hong Centres with 200 beds each in Markham and Mississauga and 250 in the new Scarborough Finch centre. Yee Hong extended its services to non-Chinese seniors, particularly those of the South Asian, Filipino and Japanese communities. All three centres contain an Alzheimer unit. A child care centre will exist side by side with the senior day care centre in the Markham and Mississauga sites with their location in relatively young communities. The Scarborough Finch Centre will accommodate a 5-bed dialysis unit, the first one of its kind to be based in a nursing home. A separate 10-bed hospice care centre unit within the complex is being built. In 2019, the provincial government approved an additional 800 beds for Yee Hong (256 beds in Markham, 320 beds in Mississauga and 224 beds in Scarborough).

Ralph Erskine was the son of Henry Erskine. He was also the younger brother of another prominent churchman, Ebenezer Erskine. He was chaplain and tutor to the 'Black' Col. John Erskine from 1705 to 1709. After studying at the University of Edinburgh, Ralph was ordained assistant minister at Dunfermline in 1711. He ratified the protests which his brother laid on the table of the assembly after being rebuked for his synod sermon, but he did not formally withdraw from the establishment till 1737. He was also present at, though not a member of, the first meeting of the \\"associate presbytery\\". When the severance took place over the oath administered to burgesses, he adhered, along with his brother, to the burgher section. His works consist of sermons, poetical paraphrases and gospel sonnets. The Gospel Sonnets have frequently appeared separately. His Life and Diary, edited by the Rev. D Fraser, was published in 1834.

As described by Harald Atmanspacher, since quantum theory is the most fundamental theory of matter that is currently available, it is a legitimate question to ask whether quantum theory can help us to understand consciousness. Large systems, such as those studied biologically, have less symmetry than the idealized systems or single crystals often studied in physics. Jeffrey Goldstone proved that where symmetry is broken, additional bosons, the Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone bosons, will then be observed in the spectrum of possible states; one canonical example being the phonon in a crystal. Ricciardi and Umezawa proposed in 1967 a general theory of quanta of long-range coherent waves within and between brain cells, and showed a possible mechanism of memory storage and retrieval in terms of Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone bosons. This was later fleshed out into a theory encompassing all biological cells and systems in the quantum biodynamics of Del Giudice and co-authors. Mari Jibu and Kunio Yasue later popularized these results and discussed the implications towards consciousness.

Early life Gillespie was born at Clearburn, in the parish of Duddingston, Edinburgh (then part of Midlothian). His father, Thomas Gillespie (1688-1712), died when he was young, and his mother, Mary Haliburton (1689-1758), ran the family farm and brewery. She encouraged him to hear Thomas Boston the elder preach. After a period in the family businesses, Gillespie studied at the University of Edinburgh from 1732. In 1738 he left for the seminary run at Perth by William Wilson (1690‚Äì1741) of the Secession Church; but was not impressed and moved on after a short while. He then went to Philip Doddridge at Northampton in 1740, with a recommendation signed by 12 Scottish ministers, five of whom were \\"Marrow Men\\". There he was ordained in January 1741. He ministered at Hartbarrow in Lancashire, and September 1741 was admitted minister of the parish of Carnock, Fife. The presbytery of Dunfermline agreed to sustain as valid the ordination he had received in England, and to allow a qualification of his subscription to the church's doctrinal symbol, so far as it had reference to the sphere of the civil magistrate in matters of religion. 1740s revival Gillespie was closely involved in the religious revivalism of the 1740s in Lanarkshire, at Kilsyth and Cambuslang. It was associated with the preaching of George Whitefield in Glasgow in 1741‚Äì2, and was taken up as a phenomenon by John Erskine, The Signs of the Times Consider'd (1742). The local ministers involved were William McCulloch at Cambuslang, and James Robe at Kilsyth. The evangelical John Maclaurin was drawn in from outside, as was Gillespie, who edited the conversion testimonies collected by McCulloch. Maclaurin and Robe wrote to Jonathan Edwards in New England, in 1742. In ensuing correspondence, Gillespie was in touch with Edwards from 1746/7. The Inverkeithing case Gillespie absented himself from presbytery meetings held to ordain Andrew Richardson, an unacceptable presentee, as minister of Inverkeithing, in southern Fife not far from Carnock. He was then deposed by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland of 1752. for maintaining that the refusal of the local presbytery to act in this case was justified. The context was the rise of the Moderate Party of the Church of Scotland, from 1751, led by William Robertson with a group of younger ministers including Hugh Blair, Alexander Carlyle and John Home. They came to an influential position in the Assembly in 1752, on a platform of the Assembly's right to adjudicate in patronage disputes. John Erskine, on the other hand, became a leader of the \\"Popular Party\\" opposing the Moderates. The opposition was also variously known as the High Flyers, Wild Party, or later as Evangelicals. After the deposition John Witherspoon wrote the anonymous Ecclesiastical Characteristics (1753) to satirise the Moderates, and James Baine became a supporter of Gillespie. Gillespie himself continued to preach, first at Carnock, and then in nearby Dunfermline. There Ralph Erskine died in 1752, and his congregation of the Secession Church sought over a period to have Gillespie as replacement. The Town Council came to support Gillespie, against the local Moderate minister James Thomson. In 1756 John Bonar received a presentation to the church of Jedburgh, from William Kerr, 4th Marquess of Lothian. He was unable to take it up, however, in the face of strong local opposition, from supporters of Thomas Boston the younger. Boston was minister at Oxnam, just outside Jedburgh, and had the support of the Town Council. The Marquess was on good terms with Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, and supported George Whitefield; his objection to the evangelical Boston was personal, rather than theological. When John Douglas was nominated instead of Bonar, Boston persisted, but lost out. In 1759 Gillespie visited Boston in the Lowlands, to give support after he resigned his ministry at Oxnam. The Relief Church In 1761, with Thomas Boston of Jedburgh, and Thomas Colier at Colinsburgh, Gillespie formed a distinct communion under the name of the \\"Presbytery of Relief\\"‚Äîrelief, that is to say, from patronage and the church courts. The foundation arose from a further dispute, at Kilconquhar in Fifeshire, over a presentation made by the James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres, when the minister James Clidsdale died in 1759, and Balcarres nominated John Chalmers as successor. Witherspoon criticised the imposition of Chalmers over local feelings, when in 1760 the General Assembly backed him. Shortly there was a secession from the congregation of Kilconquhar, meeting at Colinsburgh. Gillespie became involved, first suggesting Thomas Scott of Hexham as minister for the seceders, who was in poor health and declined. In 1761, Gillespie visited Colinsburgh, and paved the way for Colier, a native of Fife, who became minister there. His induction by Boston and Gillespie marked the beginning of the \\"Presbytery of Relief\\". Early expansions of the Presbytery were after secessions at Blairlogie (where William Cruden was rejected by the General Synod in 1760, and Auchtermuchty where Thomas Scott of Hexham came as minister in 1763. As the 1760s proceeded, congregations joined at Duns, Scottish Borders and Bellshill, where Gillespie preached in 1762. James Baine took an Edinburgh church, Lady Yester's, for the Presbytery at the end of 1766, inducted by Gillespie, over the claims of William Cruden; who went to a Glasgow church in 1767 after Boston had died. From 1769 the Relief Church, as it had become after further rapid growth, experienced internal tensions. Gillespie was believed to favour a reconciliation with the Church of Scotland, and began to distance himself, but on his death in 1774, the Relief Church maintained its independence. It eventually became one of the communions combining to form the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Works Gillespie's only literary works were an Essay on the Continuation of Immediate Revelations in the Church, and a Practical Treatise on Temptation. Both works appeared posthumously (1774). In the former he argued that immediate revelations are no longer vouchsafed to the church; in the latter he traced temptation to the work of a personal devil.

Crew Mission highlights The STS-84 mission was the sixth Shuttle/Mir docking mission and is part of the NASA/Mir program which consisted of nine Shuttle-Mir dockings and seven long duration flights of U.S. astronauts aboard the Russian space station. The prior Shuttle-Mir missions were STS-71, STS-74, STS-76, STS-79 and STS-81. The U.S. astronauts launched and landed on a Shuttle and served as Mir crew members while the Russian Mir crewmembers used their Soyuz vehicle for launch and landing. This series of missions expanded U.S. research on Mir by providing resupply materials for experiments to be performed aboard the station as well as returning experiment samples and data to Earth. STS-84 involved the transfer of of water and logistics to and from the Mir. During the docked phase, of water, of U.S. science equipment, of Russian logistics along with of miscellaneous material were transferred to Mir. Returning to Earth aboard Atlantis were of U.S. science material, of Russian logistics, of ESA material and of miscellaneous material. Sixth Shuttle-Mir docking highlighted by transfer of fourth successive U.S. crew member to the Russian Space Station. U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale exchanged places with Jerry Linenger, who arrived at Mir 15 January 1997 with the crew of Shuttle Mission STS-81. Linenger spent 123 days on Mir and just over 132 days in space from launch to landing, placing him second behind U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid for most time spent on-orbit by an American. Another milestone reached during his stay was one-year anniversary of continuous U.S. presence in space that began with Lucid's arrival at Mir 22 March 1996. Other significant events during Linenger's stay included first U.S.-Russian space walk. On 29 April 1997 Linenger participated in five-hour extravehicular activity (EVA) with Mir 23 Commander Vasily Tsibliyev to attach a monitor to the outside of the station. The Optical Properties Monitor (OPM) was to remain on Mir for nine months to allow study of the effect of the space environment on optical properties, such as mirrors used in telescopes. On 23 February, a fire broke out on the 11-year-old station. It caused minimal damage but required station's inhabitants to wear protective masks for about 36 hours until cabin air was cleaned. Besides Linenger, crew members aboard Mir at the time included two Mir 22 cosmonauts and a German cosmonaut, and two Mir 23 cosmonauts. STS-84 docking with Mir occurred on 17 May at 02:33 UTC above the Adriatic Sea. Hatches between two spacecraft opened at 04:25 am, 17 May. Greetings exchanged between STS-84 crew and Mir 23 Commander Vasily Tsibliyev, Flight Engineer Aleksandr Lazutkin and Linenger, followed by a safety briefing. Linenger and Foale officially traded places at 14:15 UTC. Transfer of items to and from Mir proceeded smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule. One of the first items transferred to station was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Altogether about 249 items were moved between the two spacecraft, and about of water moved to Mir, for a total of about of water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. The research program conducted by Foale featured 35 investigations total (33 on Mir, two on STS-84, and another preflight/postflight) in six disciplines: advanced technology, Earth observations and remote sensing, fundamental biology, human life sciences, space station risk mitigation, and microgravity sciences. Twenty-eight of these were conducted during previous missions and were to be continued, repeated or completed during Foale's stay. Seven new experiments were planned in biological and crystal growth studies and materials processing. Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp imaged by a shuttle crew member Atlantis lands at the end of the STS-84 mission. Undocking occurred at 01:04 UTC on 22 May. Unlike prior dockings, no flyaround of the station by the orbiter was conducted, but the orbiter was stopped three times while backing away to collect data from a European sensor device designed to assist future rendezvous of a proposed European Space Agency resupply vehicle with the International Space Station. Other activities conducted during the mission included investigations using the Biorack facility, located in the SPACEHAB Double Module in Atlantis's payload bay, a photo survey of Mir during docked operations, environmental air samplings and radiation monitoring. Orbiter performance was normal from launch to landing. For the mission, Atlantis was equipped with a SpaceHab Double Module, and a Orbiter Docking System.

Name The village is commonly known as Nibley, but the official name distinguishes it from the village of Nibley, just outside Yate, about away in South Gloucestershire. Nibley Green is an associated hamlet to its northwest at . History The Battle of Nibley Green fought on 20 March 1469/1470, is notable for being the last battle fought in England entirely between the private armies of feudal magnates. Nibley, the Seat of George Smyth, Esq., by Jan Kip, 1709 The Tyndale Monument was built in honour of William Tyndale, who was born nearby, possibly at Melksham Court, Stinchcombe. Tyndale was responsible for translating the New Testament into English, for which he was later sentenced to death and burned at the stake in Vilvoorde, Flanders. Nibley House, next to the church, was the home of John Smyth (1567‚Äì1641), steward of Berkeley Castle and the estates of the Berkeley family, author of Lives of the Berkeleys and historian of the early settlement of Virginia. Geography Tyndale Monument Nearby Stinchcombe Hill has become popular with walkers and horse riders, and is crossed by the Cotswold Way. The Tyndale Monument stands on Nibley Knoll just above the village, at on the Cotswold Way. From 1992, volunteers have cleared the area to recreate the previously open panoramic views of both the Severn Bridges and beyond to the Black Mountains in Wales. Present The village shop on Barrs Lane has been run as a voluntary organisation by villagers since 2001. Since 2007 the villagers have organised the annual Nibley Music Festival. The village is home to the Nibley Cobras football team and Nibley Cricket Team, who have won the legendary Pratt Cup two seasons in a row. North Nibley Cobras reformed in 2014. Starting in Stroud Division 7, they have gone on to win 2 league titles & 3 Cup titles, including a historic treble 2018-19, and are currently situated in Division 3 for the 2020-21 season. They set a Stroud League record by not conceding a goal enroute to winning the Dennis Mason Trophy 2018-19.

It built on the cooperative and scientific foundation of the International Microgravity Laboratory missions (IML-1 on STS-42 and IML-2 on STS-65), the United States Microgravity Laboratory missions (USML-1 on STS-50 and USML-2 on STS-73), the Japanese Spacelab mission (Spacelab-J on STS-47), the Spacelab Life and Microgravity Science Mission (LMS on STS-78) and the German Spacelab missions (D-1 on STS-61-A and D-2 on STS-55). MSL featured 19 materials science investigations in 4 major facilities. These facilities were the Large Isothermal Furnace, the EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to the Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack, the Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) and the Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures (CSLM) facility, the Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) and the Combustion Module-1 Facility. Additional technology experiments were to be performed in the Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the High- Packed Digital Television (HI-PAC DTV) system was used to provide multi- channel real-time analog science video. The Large Isothermal Furnace was developed by the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA) for the STS-47 Spacelab-J mission and was also flown on STS-65 IML-2 mission. It housed the Measurement of Diffusion Coefficient by Shear Cell Method Experiment, the Diffusion of Liquid Metals and Alloys Experiment, the Diffusion in Liquid Led-Tin-Telluride Experiment, the Impurity Diffusion in Ionic Melts Experiment, the Liquid Phase Sintering II Experiment (LIF), and the Diffusion Processes in Molten Semiconductors Experiment (DPIMS). The Combustion Module-1 (CM-1) facility from the NASA Lewis Research Center housed experiments on Laminar Soot Processes Experiment and the Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number Experiment (SOFBALL). The Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) is designed to investigate the fundamental combustion aspects of single, isolated droplets under different pressures and ambient oxygen concentrations for a range of droplet sizes varying between and . The DCE apparatus is integrated into a single width MSL Spacelab rack in the cargo bay. STS-94 crew on orbit The EXPRESS rack replaces a Spacelab Double rack and special hardware will provide the same structural and resource connections the rack will have on the Space Station. It will house the Physics of Hard Spheres (PHaSE) experiment and the Astro/PGBA Experiment. The Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) is used for the Experiments on Nucleation in Different Flow Regimes, Thermophysical Properties of Advanced Materials in the Undercooled Liquid State Experiment, Measurements of the Surface Tension of Liquid and Undercooled Metallic Alloys by Oscillating Drop Technique Experiment, Alloy Undercooling Experiments, the Study of the Morphological Stability of Growing Dendrites by Comparative Dendrite Velocity Measuremetns on Pure Ni and Dilute Ni-C Alloy in the Earth and Space Laboratory Experiment, the Undercooled Melts of Alloys with Polytetrahedral Short-Range Order Experiment, the Thermal Expansion of Glass Forming Metallic Alloys in the Undercooled State Experiment, the AC Calorimetry and Thermophysical Properties of Bulk Glass- Forming Metallic Liquids experiment and the Measurement of Surface Tension and Viscosity of Undercooled Liquid Metals experiment. There were also experiments on measuring microgravity. They included the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), the Microgravity Measurement Assembly (MMA), the Quasi-Steady Acceleration Measurement System and the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE). The Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) facility supported the Bubble and Drop Nonlinear Dynamics (BDND) Experiment, the Study of the Fundamental Operation of a Capillary-driven Heat Transfer (CHT) Device in Microgravity Experiment, the Internal Flows in a Free Drop (IFFD) experiment and the Fiber Supported Droplet Combustion experiment (FSDC-2).

The shuttle's previous Mir missions were STS-71, STS-74, STS-76, STS-79, STS-81 and STS-84. Highlights of the 10-day mission include five days of docked operations between Atlantis and Mir and the exchange of crew members Foale and Wolf to continue a permanent American presence of the Russia complex. A spacewalk is scheduled to retrieve the four Mir Environmental Effects Payloads which were attached to the Mir's docking module by Linda Godwin and Rich Clifford during STS-76 to characterize the environment surrounding the Mir space station. Atlantis will carry the SPACEHAB double module to support the transfer of logistics and supplies for Mir and the return of experiment hardware and specimens to Earth. The seventh Mir docking mission continued the presence of a U.S. astronaut on the Russian space station with the transfer of physician David A. Wolf to Mir. Wolf became the sixth U.S. astronaut in succession to live on Mir to continue Phase 1B of the NASA/Russian Space Agency cooperative effort. However, the difficulties encountered by Foale and his predecessor aboard Mir, Jerry Linenger, had resulted in intense political pressure on NASA. The final decision between the termination of NASA crewing of Mir with Foale's departure, or his scheduled replacement by David Wolf was only made by NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin the night before the launch of STS-86. Foale returned to Earth after spending 145 days in space, 134 of them aboard Mir. His estimated mileage logged was 58 million miles (93 million kilometers), making his the second longest U.S. space flight, behind Shannon Lucid's record of 188 days. His stay was marred by a collision on 25 June between a Progress resupply vehicle and the station's Spektr module, damaging a radiator and one of four solar arrays on Spektr. The mishap occurred while Mir 23 Commander Vasili Tsibliev was guiding the Progress capsule to a manual docking and depressurized the station. The crew sealed the hatch to the leaking Spektr module, leaving inside Foale's personal effects and several NASA science experiments, and repressurized the remaining modules. An internal space walk by Tsibliev and Mir 23 Flight Engineer Aleksandr Lazutkin was planned to reconnect power cables to the three undamaged solar arrays, but during a routine medical exam 13 July Tsibliev was found to have an irregular heartbeat. Foale then began training for the space walk, but during one of the training exercises a power cable was inadvertently disconnected, leaving the station without power. On 21 July, it was announced that the internal space walk would not be conducted by the Mir 23 crew but their successors on Mir 24. On 30 July, NASA announced that Wendy Lawrence, originally assigned to succeed Foale on Mir, was being replaced by Wolf. The change was deemed necessary to allow Wolf to act as a backup crew member for the space walks planned over the next several months to repair Spektr. Unlike Wolf, Lawrence could not fit in the Orlan suit that is used for Russian space walks and she did not undergo space walk training. Following their arrival at the station 7 August, Mir 24 Commander Anatoly Solovyev and Flight Engineer Pavel Vinogradov conducted the internal space walk inside the depressurized Spektr module 22 August, reconnecting 11 power cables from the Spektr's solar arrays to a new custom-made hatch for the Spektr. During the space walk, Foale remained inside the Soyuz capsule attached to Mir, in constant communication with the cosmonauts as well as ground controllers. On 5 September, Foale and Solovyev conducted a six-hour external extravehicular activity to survey damage outside Spektr and to try to pinpoint where the breach of the module's hull occurred. Two undamaged arrays were manually repositioned to better gather solar energy, and a radiation device left previously by Jerry Linenger was retrieved. The docking of Atlantis and Mir took place at 3:58 pm EDT, 27 September, with the two mission commanders opening the spacecraft hatches at 5:45 pm Wolf officially joined the Mir 24 at noon EDT, 28 September. At the same time, Foale became a member of the STS-86 crew and began moving his personal belongings back into Atlantis. Wolf will be replaced by the seventh and last U.S. astronaut to transfer to Mir, Andrew S. W. Thomas, when the orbiter Endeavour docks with the Russian space station during the STS-89 mission in January 1998. First joint U.S.-Russian extravehicular activity during a Shuttle mission, which was also the 39th in the Space Shuttle program, was conducted by Titov and Parazynski. During the five-hour, one- minute space walk on 1 October, the pair affixed a 121-pound () Solar Array Cap to the docking module for future use by Mir crew members to seal off the suspected leak in Spektr's hull. Parazynski and Titov also retrieved four Mir Environmental Effects Payloads (MEEPS) from the outside of Mir and tested several components of the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) jet packs. The space walk began at 1:29 pm EDT and ended at 6:30 pm Atlantis lands on Runway 15 of the KSC Shuttle Landing Facility at the end of the STS-86 mission. During the six days of docked operations, the joint Mir 24 and STS-86 crews transferred more than four tons of material from the SPACEHAB Double Module to Mir, including approximately of water, experiment hardware for International Space Station Risk Mitigation experiments to monitor the Mir for crew health and safety, a gyrodyne, batteries, three air pressurization units with breathing air, an attitude control computer and many other logistics items. The new motion control computer replaced one that had experienced problems in recent months. The crew also moved experiment samples and hardware and an old Elektron oxygen generator to Atlantis for return to Earth. Undocking took place at 1:28 pm EDT, 3 October. After undocking, Atlantis performed a 46-minute flyaround visual inspection of Mir. During this maneuver, Solovyev and Vinogradov opened a pressure regulation valve to allow air into the Spektr module to see if STS-89 crew members could detect seepage or debris particles that could indicate the location of the breach in the damaged module's hull. During the flight, Wetherbee and Bloomfield fired small jet thrusters on Atlantis to provide data for the Mir Structural Dynamics Experiment (MISDE), which measures disturbances to space station components and its solar arrays. Other experiments conducted during the mission were the Commercial Protein Crystal Growth investigation; the Cell Culture Module Experiment (CCM-A), the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM) and the Radiation Monitoring Experiment-III (RME-III); the Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Local Exhaust (SIMPLE) experiment; and the Midcourse Space Experiment. Two NASA educational outreach programs were also conducted, Seeds in Space-II and KidSat.

Life The grave of William Lindsay Alexander, Inveresk churchyard He was born in Leith, the son of William Alexander, a wine merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Lindsay. The only address given for his father appears in 1813 at 7 Blair Street off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh rather than Leith.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1813 He was educated at Leith High School then the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh, where he gained a lasting reputation for classical scholarship. He entered Glasgow Theological Academy under Ralph Wardlaw in September 1827, but in December of the same year he left to become classical tutor at the Blackburn Theological Academy, afterwards the Lancashire Independent College, in north-west England. He stayed at Blackburn until 1831, lecturing on biblical literature, metaphysics, Greek and Latin. After short visits to Germany and London, he was invited back to Edinburgh in November 1834 to become minister of North College Street church (afterwards Argyle Square), an independent church which had arisen in 1802 out of the evangelical movement associated with the Haldane brothers, Robert and James. When the church sold its property to the government to make way for the National Museum of Scotland, Alexander's congregation worshipped in the Queen Street Hall until 1861 when the new church was completed on George IV Bridge, renamed Augustine Church because of Alexander's strong, albeit independent Augustinian influence in his sermons. He deliberately put aside the ambition to become a pulpit orator in favour of the practice of biblical exposition, which he invested with charm and impressiveness. Alexander took an active part in the \\"voluntary\\" controversy which ended in the Disruption of 1843, but he also maintained broad and catholic views of the spiritual relations between different sections of the Christian church. In 1845 he visited Switzerland with the special object of inquiring into the religious life of the churches there. In 1845 he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) from the university of St Andrews. In 1854 Alexander became Professor of Theology at Edinburgh University (and Principal of the Edinburgh Theological Hall from 1877), a position which he held until 1881, in spite of many alternative offers. In 1867 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His address is then given as Pinkie Burn in Musselburgh.http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid;=8367042 He served as its Vice President from 1873 to 1878 and from 1880 to 1884. He died at Pinkieburn House just south of Musselburgh and is buried nearby in Inveresk Churchyard.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf The grave lies in the south-east corner in the plot of Sir alexander Hope.

(1864). In 1861 Alexander undertook the editorship of the third edition of John Kitto's Biblical Encyclopaedia, with the understanding that the whole work should be revised and brought up to date. In January 1870 he became one of the committee of Old Testament revisers. He edited other theological works. His Hymns for Christian Worship reached a third edition in 1866. Alexander frequently contributed to the British Quarterly, the British and Foreign Evangelical Review, Good Words, and other periodicals; he edited the Scottish Congregational Magazine, 1835-1840 and 1847‚Äì51. To the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (Eighth edition) he contributed several articles on topics of theology and philosophy (the publisher Adam Black was a member of his congregation). His articles on \\"Calvin\\" and \\"Channing\\" raised some controversy, and were changed in the ninth edition. He also contributed to the Imperial Dictionary of Biography.

His defection in 1951 to the Soviet Union, with his fellow spy Donald Maclean, led to a serious breach in Anglo-United States intelligence co-operation, and caused long-lasting disruption and demoralisation in Britain's foreign and diplomatic services. Born into a wealthy middle-class family, Burgess was educated at Eton College, the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth and Trinity College, Cambridge. An assiduous networker, he embraced left-wing politics at Cambridge and joined the British Communist Party. He was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1935, on the recommendation of the future double-agent Kim Philby. After leaving Cambridge, Burgess worked for the BBC as a producer, briefly interrupted by a short period as a full-time MI6 intelligence officer, before joining the Foreign Office in 1944. At the Foreign Office, Burgess acted as a confidential secretary to Hector McNeil, the deputy to Ernest Bevin, the Foreign Secretary. This post gave Burgess access to secret information on all aspects of Britain's foreign policy during the critical post-1945 period, and it is estimated that he passed thousands of documents to his Soviet controllers. In 1950 he was appointed second secretary to the British Embassy in Washington, a post from which he was sent home after repeated misbehaviour. Although not at this stage under suspicion, Burgess nevertheless accompanied Maclean when the latter, on the point of being unmasked, fled to Moscow in May 1951. Burgess's whereabouts were unknown in the West until 1956, when he appeared with Maclean at a brief press conference in Moscow, claiming that his motive had been to improve Soviet-West relations. He never left the Soviet Union; he was often visited by friends and journalists from Britain, most of whom reported on a lonely and empty existence. He remained unrepentant to the end of his life, rejecting the notion that his earlier activities represented treason. He was well provided for materially, but as a result of his lifestyle his health deteriorated, and he died in 1963. Experts have found it difficult to assess the extent of damage caused by Burgess's espionage activities, but consider that the disruption in Anglo-American relations caused by his defection was perhaps of greater value to the Soviets than any information he provided. Burgess's life has frequently been fictionalised, and dramatised in productions for screen and stage. Life =Family background= The Burgess family's English roots can be traced to the arrival in Britain in 1592 of Abraham de Bourgeous de Chantilly, a refugee from the Huguenot religious persecutions in France. The family settled in Kent, and became prosperous, mainly as bankers. Later generations created a military tradition; Guy Burgess's grandfather, Henry Miles Burgess, was an officer in the Royal Artillery whose main service was in the Middle East. His youngest son, Malcolm Kingsford de Moncy Burgess, was born in Aden in 1881, the third forename being a nod to his Huguenot ancestry. Malcolm had a generally unremarkable career in the Royal Navy, eventually reaching the rank of Commander. In 1907 he married Evelyn Gillman, the daughter of a wealthy Portsmouth banker. The couple settled in the naval town of Devonport where, on 16 April 1911, their elder son was born, christened Guy Francis de Moncy. A second son, Nigel, was born two years later. =Childhood and schooling= Eton College, which Burgess attended in 1924 and between 1927 and 1930 The Gillman wealth ensured a comfortable home for the young family. Guy's earliest schooling was probably with a governess until, aged nine, he began as a boarder at Lockers Park, an exclusive preparatory school near Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire. He did well there; his grades were consistently good and he played for the school's association football team. Having completed the Lockers curriculum a year early, he was too young to proceed immediately, as intended, to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. Instead, from January 1924 he spent a year at Eton College, Britain's most prestigious public school. Following Malcolm Burgess's retirement from the navy, the family moved to West Meon in Hampshire. Here, on 15 September 1924, Malcolm died suddenly of a heart attack. Despite this traumatic event, Guy's education proceeded as planned, and in January 1925 he began at Dartmouth. Here he encountered strict discipline and insistence on order and conformity, enforced by frequent use of corporal punishment even for minor infringements. In this environment, Burgess thrived both academically and at sports. He was marked by the college authorities as \\"excellent officer material\\", but an eye test in 1927 exposed a deficiency that precluded a career in the navy's executive branch. Burgess had no interest in the available alternatives ‚Äì the engineering or paymaster branches ‚Äì and in July 1927 he left Dartmouth and returned to Eton. Burgess's second period at Eton, between 1927 and 1930, was largely rewarding and successful, both academically and socially. Although he failed to be elected to the elite society known as \\"Pop\\", he began to develop a network of contacts that would prove useful in later life. At Eton, sexual relationships between boys were common, and although Burgess would claim that his homosexuality began at Eton, his contemporaries could recall little evidence of this. Generally, Burgess was remembered as amusingly flamboyant, and something of an oddity with his professed left-wing social and political opinions. In January 1930 he sat for and won a history scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, concluding his school career with further prizes in history and drawing. Throughout his life he retained fond memories of Eton; according to his biographers Stewart Purvis and Jeff Hulbert he \\"never showed any embarrassment that he had been educated in a citadel of educational privilege\\". =Cambridge= Undergraduate Burgess arrived in Cambridge in October 1930, and quickly involved himself in many aspects of student life. He was not universally liked; one contemporary described him as \\"a conceited unreliable shit\\", although others found him amusing and good company. After a term, he was elected to the Trinity Historical Society whose membership was formed from the brightest of Trinity College undergraduates and postgraduates. Here he encountered Kim Philby, and also Jim Lees, a former miner studying under a trade union scholarship, whose working-class perspective Burgess found stimulating. In June 1931 Burgess designed the stage sets for a student production of Bernard Shaw's play Captain Brassbound's Conversion, with Michael Redgrave in the leading role. Redgrave considered Burgess \\"one of the bright stars of the university scene, with a reputation for being able to turn to anything\\". Great Court, Trinity College, Cambridge Burgess by this time made no attempt to conceal his homosexuality. In 1931 he met Anthony Blunt, four years his senior and a Trinity postgraduate. The two shared artistic interests and became friends, possibly lovers. Blunt was a member of the intellectual society known as the \\"Apostles\\", to which in 1932 he secured Burgess's election. This gave Burgess a greatly extended range of networking opportunities; membership of the Apostles was lifelong, so at the regular meetings he met many of the leading intellectuals of the day, such as G. M. Trevelyan, the University's Regius Professor of History, the writer E. M. Forster, and the economist John Maynard Keynes. In the early 1930s the general political climate was volatile and threatening. In Britain, the financial crisis of 1931 pointed to the failure of capitalism, while in Germany the rise of Nazism was a source of increasing disquiet. Such events radicalised opinion in Cambridge and elsewhere; according to Burgess's fellow Trinity student James Klugmann, \\"Life seemed to demonstrate the total bankruptcy of the capitalist system and shouted aloud for some sort of quick, rational, simple alternative\\". Burgess's interest in Marxism, initiated by friends such as Lees, deepened after he heard the historian Maurice Dobb, a fellow of Pembroke College, address the Trinity Historical Society on the issue of \\"Communism: a Political and Historical Theory\\". Another influence was a fellow student, David Guest, a leading light in the Cambridge University Socialist Society (CUSS), within which he formed the university's first active communist cell. Under Guest's influence, Burgess began studying the works of Marx and Lenin. Amid these political distractions, in 1932 Burgess obtained first-class honours in Part I of the history Tripos, and was expected to graduate with similar honours in Part II the following year. But although he worked hard, political activity distracted him and by the time of his final examinations in 1933 he was unprepared. During his examinations he fell ill and was unable to complete his papers; this may have been the consequence of belated cramming, or of taking amphetamines. The examiners awarded him an aegrotat, an unclassified degree awarded to students considered worthy of honours but prevented through illness from completing their examinations. Postgraduate Cambridge War Memorial, focus of demonstrations in November 1933 Despite his disappointing degree result, Burgess returned to Cambridge in October 1933 as a postgraduate student and teaching assistant. His chosen research area was \\"Bourgeois Revolution in Seventeenth-Century England\\", but much of his time was devoted to political activism. That winter he formally joined the British Communist Party and became a member of its cell within CUSS. On 11 November 1933 he joined a mass demonstration against the perceived militarism of the city's Armistice Day celebrations. The protestors' objective, laying a wreath bearing a pacifist message at the Cambridge War Memorial, was achieved, despite attacks and counter-demonstrations which included what the historian Martin Garrett describes as \\"a hail of pro-war eggs and tomatoes\\". Alongside Burgess was Donald Maclean, a languages student from Trinity Hall and an active CUSS member. In February 1934 Burgess, Maclean and fellow members of CUSS welcomed the Tyneside and Tees-side contingents of that month's National Hunger March, as they passed through Cambridge on their way to London. When not occupied in Cambridge, Burgess made frequent visits to Oxford, to confer with kindred spirits there; according to an Oxford student's later reminiscences, at that time \\"it was impossible to be in the intellectual swim ... without coming across Guy Burgess\\". Among those he befriended was Goronwy Rees, a young Fellow of All Souls College. Rees had planned to visit the Soviet Union with a fellow don in the 1934 summer vacation, but was unable to go; Burgess took his place. During the carefully escorted trip, in June‚ÄìJuly 1934, Burgess met some notable figures, including possibly Nikolai Bukharin, editor of Izvestia and former secretary of the Comintern. On his return, Burgess had little to report, beyond commenting on the \\"appalling\\" housing conditions while praising the country's lack of unemployment. Recruitment as Soviet agent When Burgess returned to Cambridge in October 1934, his prospects of a college fellowship and an academic career were fast receding. He had abandoned his research after discovering that the same ground was covered in a new book by Basil Willey. He began an alternative study of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but his time was largely preoccupied with politics. Kim Philby, as depicted on a Soviet Union stamp Early in 1934 Arnold Deutsch, a longstanding Soviet secret agent, arrived in London under the cover of a research appointment at University College, London. Known as \\"Otto\\", his brief was to recruit the brightest students from Britain's top universities, who might in future occupy leading positions in British institutions. In June 1934 he recruited Philby, who had come to the Soviets' notice earlier that year in Vienna where he had been involved in demonstrations against the Dollfuss government. Philby recommended several of his Cambridge associates to Deutsch, including Maclean, by this time working in the Foreign Office. He also recommended Burgess, although with some reservations on account of the latter's erratic personality. Deutsch considered Burgess worth the risk, \\"an extremely well-educated fellow, with valuable social connections, and the inclinations of an adventurer\\". Burgess was given the codename \\"M√§dchen\\", meaning \\"Girl\\", later changed to \\"Hicks\\". Burgess then persuaded Blunt that he could best fight fascism by working for the Soviets. A few years later another Apostle, John Cairncross, was recruited by Burgess and Blunt, to complete the spy ring often characterised as the \\"Cambridge Five\\". Finally recognising that he had no future career at Cambridge, Burgess left in April 1935. The long-term aim of the Soviet intelligence services was for Burgess to penetrate British intelligence, and with this in mind he needed to publicly distance himself from his communist past. Thus he resigned his Communist Party membership and publicly renounced communism, with a gusto that shocked and dismayed his former comrades. He then looked for suitable work, applying without success for positions with the Conservative Research Department and Conservative Central Office. He sought a teaching job at Eton, but was rejected when a request for information from his former Cambridge tutor received the reply: \\"I would very much prefer not to answer your letter\\". Late in 1935 Burgess accepted a temporary post as personal assistant to John Macnamara, the recently elected Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Chelmsford. Macnamara was on the right of his party; he and Burgess joined the Anglo-German Fellowship, which promoted friendship with Nazi Germany. This enabled Burgess to disguise his political past very effectively, while gathering important information about Germany's foreign policy intentions. Within the Fellowship, Burgess would proclaim fascism as \\"the wave of the future\\", although in other forums such as the Apostles he was more circumspect. The association with Macnamara involved several trips to Germany; some, by Burgess's own later version of events, of a decidedly dissolute nature ‚Äì both men were gay and sexually active. These stories, according to the historian Michael Holzman, may have been invented or exaggerated to draw attention away from Burgess's true motives. In the autumn of 1936 Burgess met the nineteen-year-old Jack Hewit in The Bunch of Grapes, a well-known homosexual bar in The Strand. Hewit, a would-be dancer seeking work in London's musical theatres, would be Burgess's friend, manservant and intermittent lover for the next fourteen years, generally sharing Burgess's various London homes: Chester Square from 1936 to 1941, Bentinck Street from 1941 to 1947, and New Bond Street from 1947 until 1951. =BBC and MI6= BBC: first stint In July 1936, having twice previously applied unsuccessfully for posts at the BBC, Burgess was appointed as an assistant producer in the Corporation's Talks Department. Responsible for selecting and interviewing potential speakers for current affairs and cultural programmes, he drew on his extensive range of personal contacts and rarely met refusal. His relationships at the BBC were volatile; he quarrelled with management about his pay, while colleagues were irritated by his opportunism, his capacity for intrigue, and his slovenliness. One colleague, Gorley Putt, remembered him as \\"a snob and a slob ... It amazed me, much later in life, to learn that he had been irresistibly attractive to most people he met\\". Old Broadcasting House, BBC's London HQ from 1932 (photographed in 2007) Among those Burgess invited to broadcast were Blunt, several times, the well- connected writer-politician Harold Nicolson (a fruitful source of high-level gossip), the poet John Betjeman, and Kim Philby's father, the Arabist and explorer St John Philby. Burgess also sought out Winston Churchill, then a powerful backbench opponent of the government's appeasement policy. On 1 October 1938, during the Munich crisis, Burgess, who had met Churchill socially, went to the latter's home at Chartwell to persuade him to reconsider his decision to withdraw from a projected talks series on Mediterranean countries. According to the account provided in Tom Driberg's biography, the conversation ranged over a series of issues, with Burgess urging the statesman to \\"offer his eloquence\\" to help resolve the current crisis. The meeting ended with the presentation to Burgess of a signed copy of Churchill's book Arms and the Covenant, but the broadcast did not take place. Pursuing their main objective, the penetration of the British intelligence agencies, Burgess's controllers asked him to cultivate a friendship with the author David Footman, who they knew was an MI6 officer. Footman introduced Burgess to his superior, Valentine Vivian; as a result, over the following eighteen months Burgess carried out several small assignments for MI6 on an unpaid freelance basis. He was trusted sufficiently to be used as a back channel of communication between the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, and his French counterpart Edouard Daladier, during the period leading to the 1938 Munich summit. At the BBC, Burgess thought his choices of speaker were being undermined by the BBC's subservience to the government ‚Äì he attributed Churchill's non-appearance to this ‚Äì and in November 1938, after another of his speakers was withdrawn at the request of the prime minister's office, he resigned. MI6 was by now convinced of his future utility, and he accepted a job with its new propaganda division, known as Section D. In common with the other members of the Cambridge Five, his entry to British intelligence was achieved without vetting; his social position and personal recommendation were considered sufficient. Section D Molotov (left) and Ribbentrop at the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact Section D was established by MI6 in March 1938, as a secret organisation charged with investigating how enemies might be attacked other than through military operations. Burgess acted as Section D's representative on the Joint Broadcasting Committee (JBC), a body set up by the Foreign Office to liaise with the BBC over the transmission of anti-Hitler broadcasts to Germany. His contacts with senior government officials enabled him to keep Moscow abreast of current government thinking. He informed them that the British government saw no need for a pact with the Soviets, since they believed Britain alone could defeat the Germans without assistance. This information reinforced the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's suspicions of Britain, and may have helped to hasten the Nazi-Soviet Pact, signed between Germany and the Soviet Union in August 1939. After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Burgess, with Philby who had been brought into Section D on his recommendation, ran a training course for would-be saboteurs, at Brickendonbury Manor in Hertfordshire. Philby later was sceptical of the value of such training, since neither he nor Burgess had any idea of the tasks these agents would be expected to perform behind the lines in German-occupied Europe. In 1940, Section D was absorbed into the new Special Operations Executive (SOE). Philby was posted to a SOE training school in Beaulieu, and Burgess, who in September had been arrested for drunken driving (the charge was dismissed on payment of costs), found himself at the end of the year out of a job. BBC: second stint In mid-January 1941 Burgess rejoined the BBC Talks Department, while continuing to carry out freelance intelligence work, both for MI6 and its domestic intelligence counterpart MI5, which he had joined in a supernumerary capacity in 1940. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the BBC required Burgess to select speakers who would depict Britain's new Soviet ally in a favourable light. He turned again to Blunt, and to his old Cambridge friend Jim Lees, and in 1942 arranged a broadcast by Ernst Henri, a Soviet agent masquerading as a journalist. No transcript of Henri's talk survives, but listeners remembered it as pure Soviet propaganda. In October 1941 Burgess took charge of the flagship political programme The Week in Westminster, which gave him almost unlimited access to Parliament. Information gleaned from regular wining, lunching and gossiping with MPs was invaluable to the Soviets, regardless of the content of the programmes that resulted. Burgess sought to maintain a political balance; his fellow Etonian Quintin Hogg, a future Conservative Lord Chancellor, was a regular broadcaster, as, from the opposite social and political spectrum, was Hector McNeil, a former journalist who became a Labour MP in 1941 and served as a parliamentary private secretary in the Churchill war ministry. Burgess had lived in a Chester Square flat since 1935. From Easter 1941 he shared a house with Blunt and others at No. 5 Bentinck Street. Here, Burgess maintained an active social life with his many acquaintances, both regular and casual; Goronwy Rees likened the Bentinck Street ambience to that of a French farce: \\"Bedroom doors opened and shut, strange faces appeared and disappeared down the stairs where they passed some new visitor coming up...\\" This account was disputed by Blunt, who claimed that such casual comings and goings were contrary to house rules, since they would have disrupted other tenants' sleep. Burgess's casual work for MI5 and MI6 deflected official suspicion as to his true loyalties, but he lived in constant fear of exposure, particularly as he had revealed the truth to Rees, when trying to recruit the latter in 1937. Rees had since renounced communism, and was serving as an officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Believing that Rees might expose him and others, Burgess suggested to his handlers that they should kill Rees, or alternatively that he should do the job himself. Nothing came of this proposal. Always seeking ways of further penetrating the citadels of power, when in June 1944 Burgess was offered a job in the News Department of the Foreign Office, he accepted it. The BBC reluctantly assented to his release, stating that his departure would be \\"a serious loss\\". =Foreign Office= London As a press officer in the Foreign Office News Department, Burgess's role involved explaining government policy to foreign editors and diplomatic correspondents. His access to secret material enabled him to send Moscow important details of allied policy both before and during the March 1945 Yalta Conference. He passed information relating to the postwar futures of Poland and Germany, and also contingency plans for \\"Operation Unthinkable\\", which anticipated a future war with the Soviet Union. His Soviet masters rewarded his efforts with a ¬£250 bonus. Burgess's working methods were characteristically disorganised, and his tongue was loose; according to his colleague Osbert Lancaster, \\"[w]hen in his cups he made no bones about working for the Russians\\". Burgess had maintained contact with McNeil who, following Labour's victory in the 1945 General Election, became Minister of State at the Foreign Office, effectively Ernest Bevin's deputy. McNeil, a staunch anti-communist unsuspecting of Burgess's true allegiance, admired the latter for his sophistication and intelligence, and in December 1946 secured his services as an additional private secretary. The appointment was in breach of regular Foreign Office procedures, and there were complaints, but McNeil prevailed. Burgess quickly made himself indispensable to McNeil, and in one six-month period transmitted to Moscow the contents of 693 files, a total of over 2,000 photographed pages, for which he received a further cash reward of ¬£200. Early in 1948 Burgess was seconded to the Foreign Office's newly created Information Research Department (IRD), set up to counteract Soviet propaganda. The move was not a success; he was indiscreet, and his new colleagues thought him \\"dirty, drunken and idle\\". He was quickly sent back to McNeil's office, and in March 1948 accompanied McNeil and Bevin to Brussels for the signing of the Treaty of Brussels, which eventually led to the establishment of the Western European Union and NATO. He remained with McNeil until October 1948, when he was posted to the Foreign Office's Far East Department. Burgess was assigned to the China desk at a point when the Chinese civil war was nearing its climax, a communist victory imminent. There were important differences of view between Britain and the U.S. on future diplomatic relations with the forthcoming communist state. Burgess was a forceful advocate for recognition, and may have influenced Britain's decision to recognise communist China in 1949. In February 1949, a fracas at a West End Club ‚Äì possibly the RAC ‚Äì resulted in a fall downstairs that left Burgess with severe head injuries, following which he was hospitalised for several weeks. Recovery was slow; according to Holzman he never functioned well after that. Nicolson noted the decline: \\"Oh my dear, what a sad, sad thing this constant drinking is! Guy used to have one of the most rapid and active minds I knew\\". Later in 1949 a holiday in Gibraltar and North Africa became a catalogue of drunkenness, promiscuous sex, and arguments with diplomatic and MI6 staff, exacerbated by the frankly homophobic attitudes towards Burgess by some local officials. Back in London, Burgess was reprimanded, but somehow retained the confidence of his superiors, so that his next posting, in July 1950, was to Washington, as second secretary in what Purvis and Hulbert describe as \\"one of the UK's highest profile embassies, the creme de la creme of diplomatic postings\\". Washington Anthony Eden, Burgess's \\"guest\\" Philby had preceded Burgess to Washington, and was serving there as local head of MI6, following in the path of Maclean who had worked as the embassy's first secretary between 1944 and 1948. Burgess soon reverted to his erratic and intemperate habits, causing regular embarrassment in British diplomatic circles. Despite this, he was given work of top secret sensitivity. Among his duties he served on the inter-allied board responsible for the conduct of the Korean War, which gave him access to America's strategic war plans. His frequent behavioural lapses did not prevent his being chosen to act as escort to Anthony Eden, when the future British prime minister visited Washington in November 1950. The episode passed without trouble; the two, both Etonians, got on well, and Burgess received a warm letter of thanks from Eden \\"for all your kindness\\". Increasingly, Burgess was dissatisfied with his job. He considered leaving the diplomatic service altogether, and began sounding out his Eton friend Michael Berry about a journalistic post on The Daily Telegraph. Early in 1951 a series of indiscretions, including three speeding tickets on a single day, made his position at the embassy untenable, and he was ordered by the ambassador, Sir Oliver Franks, to return to London. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army's Venona counterintelligence project, investigating the identity of a Soviet spy codenamed \\"Homer\\" who had been active in Washington a few years earlier, had unearthed strong evidence that pointed to Donald Maclean. Philby and his Soviet spymasters believed that Maclean might crack when confronted by British intelligence, and expose the entire Cambridge ring. Burgess was thus given the task, on reaching London, of organising Maclean's defection to the Soviet Union. =Defection= Departure Burgess returned to England on 7 May 1951. He and Blunt then contacted Yuri Modin, the Soviet spymaster in charge of the Cambridge ring, who began arrangements with Moscow to receive Maclean. Burgess showed little urgency in proceeding with the matter, finding time to pursue his personal affairs and attend an Apostles dinner in Cambridge. On 11 May he was summoned to the Foreign Office to answer for his misconduct in Washington and, according to Boyle, was dismissed. Other commentators say he was invited to resign or \\"retire\\", and was given time to consider his position. Burgess's diplomatic career was over, although he was not at this stage under any suspicion of treachery. He met with Maclean several times; according to Burgess's 1956 account to Driberg, the question of defection to Moscow was not raised until their third meeting, when Maclean said he was going and requested Burgess's help. Burgess had previously promised Philby that he would not go with Maclean, since a double defection would put Philby's own position in serious jeopardy. Blunt's unpublished memoirs state that it was Moscow's decision to send Burgess with Maclean who, they thought, would be unable to handle the complicated escape arrangements alone. Burgess told Driberg that he had agreed to accompany Maclean because he was leaving the Foreign Office anyway, \\"and I probably couldn't stick the job at the Daily Telegraph\\". SS Falaise, the ship on which Burgess and Maclean fled in May 1951 Meanwhile, the Foreign Office had fixed Monday 28 May as the date for confronting Maclean with their suspicions. Philby notified Burgess who, on Friday 25 May, bought two tickets for a weekend channel cruise on the steamship Falaise. These short cruises docked at the French port of St Malo, where passengers could disembark for a few hours without passport checks. Burgess also hired a saloon car, and that evening drove to Maclean's house at Tatsfield in Surrey, where he introduced himself to Maclean's wife Melinda as \\"Roger Styles\\". After the three had dined, Burgess and Maclean drove rapidly to Southampton, boarding the Falaise just before its midnight departure ‚Äì the hired car was left abandoned on the quayside. The pair's subsequent movements were revealed later. On arrival in St Malo they took a taxi to Rennes, then travelled by rail to Paris and on to Berne in Switzerland. Here, by prior arrangement, they were issued with papers at the Soviet embassy, before travelling to Zurich, where they caught a flight to Prague. Safely behind the Iron Curtain, they were able to proceed smoothly on the final stages of their journey to Moscow. Aftermath On Saturday 26 May, Hewit informed a friend that Burgess had not come home the previous night. Since Burgess never went away without telling his mother, his absence caused some anxiety in his circle. Maclean's non-appearance at his desk on the following Monday raised concerns that he might have absconded. Disquiet increased when officials realised that Burgess, too, was missing; the discovery of the abandoned car, hired in Burgess's name, together with Melinda Maclean's revelations about \\"Roger Styles\\", confirmed that both had fled. Blunt quickly visited Burgess's flat in New Bond Street and removed incriminating materials. An MI6 search of the flat revealed papers that compromised another member of the Cambridge ring, Cairncross, who was later required to resign from his civil service post. The news of the double flight alarmed the Americans, following the recent conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, and the defection of the physicist Bruno Pontecorvo the previous year. Aware that his own position was now precarious, Philby recovered various spying paraphernalia from Burgess's former Washington quarters, and buried them in a nearby wood. Summoned to London in June 1951, he was interrogated for several days by MI6. There were strong suspicions that he was responsible for forewarning Maclean via Burgess, but in the absence of conclusive evidence he faced no action and was permitted to retire quietly from MI6. In the immediate aftermath the Foreign Office made nothing public. In private circles, many rumours abounded: the pair had been kidnapped by the Russians, or by the Americans, or were replicating the flight of Rudolf Hess to Scotland in 1941 in an unofficial peace mission. The press was suspicious, and the story finally broke in the Daily Express on 7 June. A cautious Foreign Office statement then confirmed that Maclean and Burgess were missing and were being treated as absent without leave. In the House of Commons the Foreign Secretary, Herbert Morrison, said there was no indication that the missing diplomats had taken secret documents with them, nor would he attempt to prejudge the issue of their destination. On 30 June the Express offered a reward of ¬£1,000 for information on the diplomats' current whereabouts, an amount dwarfed shortly afterwards by the Daily Mails offer of ¬£10,000. There were numerous false sightings in the months that followed. Some press reports speculated that Burgess and Maclean were being held in Moscow's Lubyanka prison. Harold Nicolson thought the Soviets would \\"use [Burgess] for a month or so and then quietly shove him into some salt mine\\". Just before Christmas 1953, Burgess's mother received a letter from her son, postmarked in South London. The letter, full of affection and messages for his friends, revealed nothing of his location or circumstances. In April 1954 a senior MGB officer, Vladmir Petrov, defected in Australia. He brought with him papers indicating that Burgess and Maclean had been Soviet agents since their Cambridge days, that the MGB had masterminded their escape, and that they were alive and well in the Soviet Union. =In the Soviet Union= Bolshaya Pirogovskaya Street, Moscow, where Burgess lived from 1956 After being held in Moscow for a short period, Burgess and Maclean were sent to Kuybyshev, an industrial city which Burgess described as \\"permanently like Glasgow on a Saturday night\\". He and Maclean were granted Soviet citizenship in October 1951, and took fresh identities: Burgess became \\"Jim Andreyevitch\\". Unlike Maclean, who learned the language and quickly took up useful work, Burgess spent much of his time reading, drinking, and complaining to the authorities about his treatment ‚Äì he had not intended his stay to be permanent. He expected to be permitted to return to England, where he thought he could brazen out his MI5 interrogation. He also found the Soviets intolerant of homosexuality, although eventually he was allowed to retain a Russian lover, Tolya Chisekov. By early 1956 Burgess had moved back to Moscow, to a flat on Bolshaya Pirogovskaya Street, and was working part-time at the Foreign Literature Publishing House, promoting the translation of classic British novels. In February 1956 the Soviet government allowed Burgess and Maclean to hold a brief press conference, which included two Western journalists ‚Äì the first concrete proof to the West that the missing diplomats were alive. In a short statement, they denied they were communist spies and said they had come to Moscow \\"to achieve better understanding between the Soviet Union and the West\\". In Britain, reaction to their reappearance was strongly condemnatory, epitomised in a series of articles in The People, purportedly written by Burgess's former friend Rees. The articles, which described Burgess as \\"the greatest traitor in our history\\", sought to emphasise Burgess's supposed dissolute lifestyle and, in the opinion of his biographer Sheila Kerr, \\"did much to prolong and accentuate repressive attitudes to homosexuality\\" in Britain. In July 1956 the Soviet authorities allowed Burgess's mother to visit her son. She stayed a month, mainly in the holiday resort of Sochi. During August the journalist and Labour Party politician Tom Driberg flew to Moscow to interview Burgess ‚Äì the two had first met through The Week in Westminster. On his return, Driberg wrote a book in which Burgess was portrayed relatively sympathetically. Some assumed that the content had been vetted by the KGB as a propaganda exercise; others thought its purpose was to trap Burgess into revealing information that could lead to his prosecution, should he ever return to Britain. Over the following years Burgess received numerous visitors from England. Redgrave came with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in February 1959; this visit led to Burgess's meeting with the actress Coral Browne, a friendship later the subject of Alan Bennett's play An Englishman Abroad. In the same year Burgess gave a filmed interview to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), forgotten until its rediscovery in 2015. In it, Burgess revealed that while he wished to continue living in Russia, he maintained an affection for his home country. When the British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, visited Moscow in 1959, Burgess offered his expertise to the visiting party (he had once spent an evening with Macmillan at the Reform Club). His offer was declined, but he used this opportunity to lobby officials for permission to visit Britain where, he said, his mother was sick. Although aware on legal advice that a successful prosecution against Burgess would be problematic, the Foreign Office issued statements implying he would face instant arrest in Britain. In the event, Burgess chose not to put the issue to the test. =Decline and death= St John's Church, West Meon, where Burgess's ashes were interred Burgess suffered from increasing ill-health, largely due to a lifestyle based on poor food and excessive alcohol. In 1960 and 1961 he was treated in hospital for arteriosclerosis and ulcers, on the latter occasion being close to death. In April 1962, writing to his friend Esther Whitfield, he indicated how his belongings should be allocated should he die ‚Äì Blunt, Philby and Chisekov were all named as beneficiaries. In January 1963 Philby defected to Moscow, having finally been unmasked ‚Äì after official exoneration by Macmillan in 1956. He and Burgess kept apart, though they may have met briefly, when the latter was on his deathbed in August 1963. Burgess died on 30 August, of arteriosclerosis and acute liver failure. He was cremated five days later; Nigel Burgess represented the family, and Maclean delivered a eulogy describing his co-defector as \\"a gifted and courageous man who devoted his life to the cause of a better world\\". Burgess's ashes were returned to England, and on 5 October 1963 were interred in the family plot at St John the Evangelist Churchyard in West Meon. Assessment Modin considered Burgess the leader of the Cambridge spies: \\"He held the group together, infused it with his energy and led it into battle\\". He sent quantities of information to Moscow ‚Äì thousands of documents including policy papers, Cabinet minutes and notes of Imperial General Staff meetings. According to Holzman, \\"Burgess and Maclean ensured that hardly anything done by the British Foreign Office was not known to the Soviet foreign intelligence services\\". However, views are divided as to what use the Soviets made of this information, or whether they trusted it. Released papers by the Foreign Intelligence Services of the Russian Federation record that \\"of particular value was the information [he] obtained about the positions of Western countries on the postwar settlement in Europe, Britain's military strategy, NATO [and] the activities of British and American intelligence agencies\\". But the apparent ease with which Burgess and his colleagues could acquire and send such volumes of data also created suspicions in Moscow that they were being fed misinformation. Thus, the extent of damage to British interests suffered by Burgess's activities is a matter of conjecture; Kerr concludes that \\"despite much fevered speculation ... there is too little evidence on the effects of [Burgess's] espionage and his influence upon international politics for a credible assessment to be feasible.\\" The British Establishment found it difficult to accept how someone of Burgess's background and education could betray the system that had sustained him in comfort and privilege. According to Rebecca West in The Meaning of Treason, the demoralisation and panic caused by Burgess's defection was of greater value than the information he passed to the Soviets. The damage to Anglo-U.S. intelligence co-operation was severe; all atomic intelligence liaison between the two countries was suspended for several years. Foreign Office complacency about recruitment and security was shattered, and although positive vetting was belatedly introduced, the diplomatic service suffered what Burgess's biographer Andrew Lownie calls \\"a culture of suspicion and mistrust that was still being played out half a century after the 1951 flight\\". Against the popular denunciations of \\"traitor\\" and \\"spy\\", Burgess was, in Holzman's words, a revolutionary and idealist, identifying with those who thought that their society \\"was deeply unjust and that its Empire spread this injustice throughout the world\\". He never deviated from the ideological justification that he gave on his reappearance in 1956; he believed that the stark choice to be made in the twentieth century was between America and the Soviet Union. Noel Annan, in his account of British intellectual life between the world wars, states that Burgess \\"was a true Stalinist who hated liberals more than imperialists\\" and \\"simply believed that Britain's future lay with Russia not America\\". quoted in Holzman, p. 373 Burgess insisted there was no viable case against him in England (a view secretly shared by the British authorities), but would not visit there, since he might be prevented from returning to Moscow where he wished to live \\"because I am a socialist and this is a socialist country\\". Burgess's life, says Lownie, can only be explained by an understanding of \\"the intellectual maelstrom of the 1930s, particularly amongst the young and impressionable\\". Yet Lownie points out that most of his fellow Cambridge communists did not work for the Russians, and indeed reassessed their position after the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Holzman stresses the high price of Burgess's political continuing commitment, which \\"cost him everything else he valued: the possibility of fulfilling intimate relationships, the social life that revolved around the BBC, Fleet Street and Whitehall, even the chance to be with his mother as she lay dying\\". Of the other Cambridge spies, Maclean and Philby lived out their lives in Moscow, dying in 1983 and 1988 respectively. Blunt, who was interrogated many times, finally confessed in 1964, although in return for his co-operation this was not made public before his exposure in 1979; he died four years later. Cairncross, who made a partial confession in 1964 and continued thereafter to cooperate with the British authorities, worked as a writer and historian before his death in 1995. Aspects of Burgess's life have been fictionalised in several novels, and dramatised on numerous occasions. An early (1954) novel, The Troubled Midnight by Rodney Garland, was followed by, among others, Nicholas Monsarrat's Smith and Jones (1963), and Michael Dobbs's Winston's War (2003), which builds on the pre-war meeting between Burgess and Churchill. Stage and screen works include Bennett's An Englishman Abroad, Granada TV's 1987 drama Philby, Burgess and Maclean (1977), the 2003 BBC miniseries Cambridge Spies, and John Morrison's 2011 stage play A Morning with Guy Burgess, set in the last months of his life and examining themes of loyalty and betrayal.

It was the 88th flight of the Space Shuttle, and the 24th flight of Columbia. The mission goals were to conduct experiments using the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-4), conduct two EVAs, and to deploy the SPARTAN-201 experiment. This mission marked the first time an EVA was performed from Columbia. An EVA from Columbia was originally planned for STS-5 in 1982, but was cancelled due to spacesuit problems.

Mid-deck experiments included the Middeck Glovebox Payload (MGBX) and the Collaborative Ukrainian Experiment (CUE). STS-87 in-flight crew portrait = United States Microgravity Payload = The United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-4) is a Spacelab project managed by Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama. The complement of microgravity research experiments is divided between two Mission-Peculiar Experiment Support Structures (MPESS) in the payload bay. The extended mission capability offered by the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) kit provides an opportunity for additional science gathering time. = SPARTAN-201 = Deployment of SPARTAN Spartan 201-04 is a Solar Physics Spacecraft designed to perform remote sensing of the hot outer layers of the sun's atmosphere or solar corona. It is expected to be deployed on orbit 18 and retrieved on orbit 52. The objective of the observations are to investigate the mechanisms causing the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the solar wind which originates in the corona. Two primary experiments are the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, and the White Light Coronograph (WLC) from the High Altitude Observatory. Spartan 201 has three secondary experiments. The Technology Experiment Augmenting Spartan (TEXAS) is a Radio Frequency (RF) communications experiment which provided flight experience for components baselined on future Spartan missions, and a real time communications and control link with the primary Spartan 201 experiments. This link was used to provide a fine pointing adjustment to the WLC based on solar images downlinked real time. The Video Guidance Sensor (VGS) Flight Experiment is a laser guidance system which tested a key component of the Automated Rendezvous and Capture (AR&C;) system. The Spartan Auxiliary Mounting Plate (SPAM) is a small equipment mounting plate which provided a mounting location for small experiments or auxiliary equipment of the Spartan Flight Support Structure (SFSS) It is a honeycomb plate using an experimental Silicon Carbide Aluminum face sheet material with an aluminum core. = Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace = The Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (AADSF) is a sophisticated materials science facility used for studying a common method of processing semiconductor crystals called directional solidification. Solidification is the process of freezing materials. In the type of directional solidification to be used in AADSF, the liquid sample, enclosed in quartz ampoules, will be slowly solidified along the long axis. A mechanism will move the sample through varying temperature zones in the furnace. To start processing, the furnace melts all but one end of the sample towards the other. Once crystallized, the sample remains in the furnace to be examined post-flight. The solidification front is of particular interest to scientists because the flows found in the liquid material influence the final composition and structure of the solid and its properties. = Confined Helium Experiment = The Confined Helium Experiment (CHeX) provides a test of theories of the influence of boundaries on matter by measuring the heat capacity of helium as it is confined to two dimensions. = Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment = Animated GIF of dendrite formation ‚Äì NASA The Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE) is a materials science solidification experiment that researchers will use to investigate a particular type of solidification called dendritic growth. Dendritic solidification is one of the most common forms of solidifying metals and alloys. When materials crystallize or solidify under certain condition, they freeze unstably, resulting in tiny, tree-like crystalline forms called dendrites. Scientist are particularly interested in dendrite size, shape, and how the branches of the dendrites interact with each other. These characteristics largely determine the properties of the material. Designed for research on the directional solidification of metallic alloys, the Material pour l'Etude des Phenomenes Interssant la Solidification sur Terre et en Orbite (MEPHISTO) experiment is primarily interested in measuring the temperature, velocity, and shape of the solidification front (the point where the solid and liquid contact each other during solidification.) MEPHISTO simultaneously processes three identical cylindrical samples of bismuth and tin alloy. In the first sample, the temperature fluctuations of the moving solidification are measured electrically, with disturbing the sample. The position of the solid to liquid border is determined by an electrical resistance technique in the second sample. In the third sample, the faceted solidification front is marked at selected intervals with electric current pulses. The samples are returned to Earth for analysis. During the mission, MEPHISTO data will be correlated with data from the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS). By comparing data, scientists can determine how accelerations aboard the shuttle disturb the solid to liquid interface. = Space Acceleration Measurement System = The Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), sponsored by NASA Lewis Research Center (now NASA Glenn Research Center), is a microprocessor-driven data acquisition system designed to measure and record the microgravity acceleration environment of the USMP carrier. The SAMS has three triaxial sensor heads that are separate from the electronics package for remote positioning. In operation, the triaxial sensor head produces output signals in response to acceleration inputs. The signals are amplified, filtered, and converted into digital data. The digital acceleration data is transferred to optical disk memory for ground analysis and downlinked to the ground for near-real-time analysis. Each accelerometer has a mass suspended by a quartz element is such a manner to allow movement along one axis only. A coil is attached to the mass and the assembly is placed between two permanent magnets. An applied acceleration displaces the mass form its resting position. This movement is sensed by a detector, causing SAMS electronics to send a voltage to the coil, producing exactly the magnetic field needed to restore the mass to its original position. The applied voltage is proportional to the applied acceleration and is output to the SAMS electronics as acceleration data. = Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment = While flying separately in the cargo bay, the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), sponsored by NASA Lewis Research Center (now Glenn Research Center), is an integral part of USMP-04. It is a highly sensitive instrument designed to acquire and record data of low-level aerodynamic acceleration along the orbiter's principal axes in the free-molecular flow regime at orbital altitudes and in the transition regime during re-entry. OARE data is also downlinked during the mission for near-real-time analysis in support of the USMP science experiments. OARE data will support advances in space materials processing by providing measurements of the low-level, low frequency disturbance environment affecting various microgravity experiments. OARE data will also support advances in orbital drag prediction technology by increasing the understanding of the fundamental flow phenomena in the upper atmosphere. = Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment = The objective of the Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment (SOLSE) is to determine the altitude distribution of ozone in an attempt to understand its behavior so that quantitative changes in the composition of our atmosphere can be predicted. SOLSE is intended to perform ozone distribution that a nadir instrument can achieve. This will be performed using Charged Coupled Device (CCD) technology to eliminate moving parts in a simpler, low cost, ozone mapping instrument. The experiment is housed in a Hitchhiker (HH/GAS) canister with canister extension ring and equipped with a Hitchhiker Motorized Door Assembly (HMDA). Instrumentation includes an Ultraviolet (UV) spectrograph with a CCD array detector, CCD array and visible light cameras, calibration lamp, optics and baffling. Once on orbit a crew member will active SOLSE which will perform limb and Earth viewing observations. Limb observations focuses on the region to altitude above the horizon for the Earth's surface. Earth viewing observations will enable SOLSE to correlate the data with other nadir viewing, ozone instruments. = Loop Heat Pipe = The Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) test will advance thermal energy management technology and validating technology readiness for upcoming commercial spacecraft applications. The LHP will be operated with anhydrous ammonia as the working fluid to transport thermal energy with high effective conductivity in zero gravity. LHP is a passive, two-phase flow heat transfer device that is capable of transporting up to 400 watts over a distance of 5 meters through semiflexible, small- diameter tubes. It uses capillary forces to circulate the two-phase working fluid. The system is self-priming and totally passive in operation. When heat is applied to the LHP evaporator, part of the working fluid vaporizes. The vapor flows through the vapor transport lines and condenses, releasing heat. The condense returns to the evaporator via capillary action through the liquid transport lines. = Sodium Sulfur Battery Experiment = The Sodium Sulfur Battery Experiment (NaSBE) characterized the performance of four 40 ampere- hour sodium-sulfur battery cells, representing the first test of sodium-sulfur battery technology in space. Each cell is composed of a sodium anode, sulfur cathode, and solid ceramic sodium ion conducting electrolyte and separator. The cells must be heated to 350 degrees Celsius to liquefy the sodium and sulfur. Once the anode and cathode were liquefied, the cells started to generate electrical power. Once in orbit, a crewmember activated NaSBE and then the experiment was controlled by the GSFC Payload Operations Control Center (POCC). = Turbulent Gas Jet Diffusion Flames = The Turbulent Gas Jet Diffusion Flames (TGDF) payload is a secondary payload that used the standard Get Away Special carrier. Its purpose is to gain an understanding of the fundamental characteristics of transitional and turbulent gas jet diffusion flames under microgravity conditions and to acquire data that will aid in predicting the behavior of transitional and turbulent gas jet diffusion flames under normal and microgravity environments. TGDF will impose large- scale controlled disturbances on well-defined laminar microgravity diffusion flames. The will be on axisymmetric perturbations to laminar flames. The variables for the proposed tests will be the frequency of the disturbance mechanism which will be either 2.5 Hz, 5 Hz, or 7.5 Hz. = Get Away Special = Get Away Special (GAS G-036) payload canister contained four separate experiments that hydrate cement samples, record configuration stability of fluid samples, and expose computer discs, compact discs, and asphalt samples to exosphere conditions in the cargo bay of the orbiter. The experiments are the Cement Mixing Experiment (CME), the Configuration Stability of Fluid Experiment (CSFE), the Computer Compact Disc Evaluation Experiment (CDEE) and the Asphalt Evaluation Experiment (AEE). = Extended Duration Orbiter = The Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) Pallet is a 15-foot (4.6 m) diameter cryo-kit wafer structure. Weighing , it provides support for tanks, associated control panels, and avionics equipment. The tanks store of liquid hydrogen at ‚àí250 degrees Celsius, and of liquid oxygen at ‚àí176 degrees Celsius. Total empty mass of the system is . When filled with cryogens, system mass is approximately . Oxygen and hydrogen are supplied to the orbiter's three electrical power generating fuel cells, where they are converted into sufficient electrical energy to support the average 4 family-member house for approximately 6 months. About of pure drinking water is also produced by the fuel cells. With the EDO pallet, the orbiter can support a flight for a maximum of 18 days. Longer on-orbit missions benefit microgravity research, Life Sciences research, Earth and celestial observations, human adaptation to the zero-G environment, and support to the Space Station. = Middeck Glove Box = The Middeck Glove Box (MGBX) is a facility designed for materials science and biological science experiment handling. It consists of two primary systems; an Interface Frame (IF) and a Glovebox (GB). The MGBX facility (with associated electronics) provides an enclosed working area for experiment manipulation and observation on the shuttle mid-deck. The MGBX experiments on this flight are: WCI ‚Äì The objective of the Wetting Characteristics of Immiscibles was to investigate the influence of alloy/ampoule wetting characteristics on the segregation of immiscible liquids during microgravity processing. The Enclosed Laminar Flames (ELF) experiment objective was to validate the zero-gravity Burke-Schumann model and the gravity-dependent Hegde-Bahadori extension of the model, investigate the importance of the buoyancy-dependent flow field as affected by oxidizer flow on flame stabilization, examine the state relationships of co-flow diffusion flames under the influence of buoyancy conditions (gravity versus pressure), and study the flow vortex and diffusion flame interactions. The Particle Engulfment and Pushing by Solidifying Interfaces (PEP) experiment objectives were to generate an accurate value for the critical velocity in a convection- free environment, validate present theoretical model, enhance fundamental understanding of dynamics of insoluble particles at liquid/solid interfaces, and improve understanding of physics associated with solidification of liquid metals-ceramic particles mixtures. = Collaborative Ukraine Experiment = The Collaborative Ukraine Experiment (CUE) was a mid-deck payload designed to study the effects of microgravity on plant growth. The CUE is composed of a group of experiments that will be flown in the Plant Growth Facility (PGF) and in the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC). The experiments also required the use of a Gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) Freezer and the fixation hardware. Investigators in Ukraine and the United States selected the experiments as a model for scientific collaboration between the two countries. The PGF supported plant growth for up to 30 days by providing acceptable environmental conditions for normal plant growth. The PGF is composed of the following subsystems: Control and Data Management Subsystems (CDMS), Fluorescent Light Module (FLM), Atmospheric Control Module (ACM), Plant Growth Chambers (PGCs), Support Structure Assembly (SSA), and the Generic External Shell (GES). The complete PGF replaced one mid-deck locker and operated on 28 V direct current (dc) power. The plant specimen studied in the PGF was Brassica rapa (turnip).  Extra-vehicular Activities  The Extravehicular Activity Development Flight Test ‚Äì 05 (EDFT-05) consists of the payload bay hardware elements of Detailed Test Objective (DTO) 671, EVA Hardware for Future Scheduled Extravehicular Missions. EDFT ‚Äì 05's main objective is to demonstrate International Space Station (ISS) on-orbit, end-to-end EVA assembly and maintenance operations. The other DTO's included in this test are DTO 672, Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Electrical Cuff Checklist and DTO 833, EMU Thermal Comfort and EVA Worksite Thermal Environment. Another objective is to expand the EVA experience base for ground and flight crews. Two EVA's will be performed on this mission to accomplish these DTO's. = Autonomous EVA Robotic Camera = Winston Scott retrieves Sprint The Autonomous EVA Robotic Camera/Sprint (AERCam/Sprint) is a small, unobtrusive, free-flying camera platform for use outside a spacecraft. The free-flyer has a self-contained cold gas propulsion system giving it the capability to be propelled with a 6 degrees of freedom control system. On board the free-flyer are rate sensors to provide data for an automatic attitude hold capability. AERCam/Sprint is a spherical vehicle that moves slowly and is covered in a soft cushioning material to prevent damage in the event of an impact. The design philosophy is to keep the energy low by keeping the velocities and mass low while providing a mechanism to absorb any energy from an impact. The free-flyer platform is controlled from inside the Orbiter by using a small control station. The operator inputs motion commands from a single, Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) device controller. The commands are sent from the control station to the free- flyer via a Radio Frequency (RF) modem link operating in the ultra high frequency (UHF) range.  A comic character in space  The mission marked a lesser known first for having a comic book character being created for a space-going mission, the first to actually fly into space and the first to safely return to Earth. The sponsor and manager of the Enclosed Laminar Flames experiment, Lewis Stocker, noticed the experiments' abbreviation as ELF and, being an avowed reader of the comic book series Elfquest, contacted the series' creators Richard and Wendy Pini and asked to create a logo. Originally, he hoped the series' own star-gazer, Skywise, could be used, but to avoid copyright issues, a unique character was created instead to accompany the experiment insignia, whose name was dubbed Starfire. Although the comic worlds have their fair share of characters that come from outer space (like Superman), it eventually became the only character to be \\"earth-bound\\" to go into space and back, thus far. Even when taking into account the spoof from the Apollo and Gemini programs into account, who have several references to existing cartoon and comic book characters, such as Snoopy, The Road-Runner or Casper, Starfire is in that regard even more truly a unique contribution.https://elfquest.com/elfquest-takes-a-ride-on-the-space-shuttle/ http://elfquest.com/images/news/images/starfire-big.gif In line with this, a spoof exists depicting the playful disappointment the series' resident star- gazer was not allowed to fly, showing a gruntled Skywise glaring at Starfire, who only shrugs as it was how it was supposed to be.http://www.janesenese.com/swiftverse/media/thumb_starfire-and-skywise.JPG See also *List of human spaceflights *List of Space Shuttle missions *Outline of space science References External links * NASA mission summary * STS-87 Video Highlights Category:Spacecraft launched in 1997 Category:Space Shuttle missions Category:Kalpana Chawla ","title":"STS-87"},{"id":"557163","text":"The Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature is an annual prize of ¬£3,000 awarded by the Boardman Tasker Charitable Trust to an author or authors for 'an original work which has made an outstanding contribution to mountain literature.'

Hackett contributed to six Genesis studio albums, three live albums, seven singles and one EP before he left to pursue a solo career. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. Hackett released his first solo album, Voyage of the Acolyte, while still a member of Genesis in 1975. After a series of further solo albums beginning in 1978, Hackett co-founded the supergroup GTR with Steve Howe in 1986. The group released the self-titled album GTR, which peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200 in the United States and spawned the Top 20 single \\"When the Heart Rules the Mind\\". When Hackett left GTR in 1987, the group disbanded. Hackett then resumed his solo career. He has released albums and toured worldwide on a regular basis since. Hackett's body of work encompasses many styles; in addition to his work in progressive rock, he has explored pop, blues, world music and classical music on his solo recordings. According to Guitar World: \\"Hackett's early explorations of two- handed tapping and sweep picking were far ahead of their time, and influenced Eddie Van Halen and Brian May.\\" Other guitarists influenced by Hackett include Alex Lifeson and Steve Rothery.  Early life  Stephen Richard Hackett was born on 12 February 1950 in Pimlico, south central London to Peter and June Hackett. He was born one day before his future Genesis bandmate, singer Peter Gabriel. He has a younger brother John who took up the flute and has performed, collaborated, and written with Hackett throughout his solo career. Hackett attended Sloane Grammar School in Chelsea. In the 1950s, the family relocated to Vancouver, Canada but returned home after his parents, his mother in particular, became too homesick. Hackett grew up having access to various musical instruments, such as the harmonica and recorder, but he did not develop an interest in the guitar until the age of 12 when he started playing single notes. By 14, he was learning chords and experimenting with chord progressions, although he never received any formal training. Hackett's earliest musical influences were classical (Johann Sebastian Bach) and opera (Mario Lanza). He has said that his compositions are still influenced by them. Hackett also has cited numerous British blues artists as influences, namely Danny Kirwan, Peter Green, and various guitarists in John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, as well as Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, and King Crimson.  Career  = 1968‚Äì1970: Early bands = Hackett's first professional playing experience came as a member of three rock bands: Canterbury Glass, with whom he played on \\"Prologue\\" on their album Sacred Scenes and Characters which was recorded in 1968 but distributed in 2007; Heel Pier; and Sarabande, all of whom performed rock with progressive rock elements. He then joined Quiet World in 1970 which featured his brother John on flute. He did not write any material with the group as the band's founders directed what the other members played, which did not bother Hackett as he wished to get more experience in a recording studio since the band had secured a contract with a label. Hackett played on the band's only studio album, The Road (1970), released on Dawn Records, and left them soon after. = 1970‚Äì1977: Genesis = In December 1970, Hackett placed an advertisement in Melody Maker in his search for a new band. It read: \\"Imaginative guitarist-writer seeks involvement with receptive musicians, determined to strive beyond existing stagnant music forms\\". It was responded to by Genesis lead vocalist Peter Gabriel. Genesis, which also comprised keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, and drummer Phil Collins, had lost founding guitarist Anthony Phillips and sought a new, permanent replacement to his temporary replacement Mick Barnard. Gabriel advised Hackett to listen to their last album Trespass (1970) before Hackett auditioned for the group. Hackett's first live gig with Genesis took place at City University, London on 24 January 1971. Hackett on stage with Genesis, 1977 Hackett's first recording with Genesis was Nursery Cryme (1971). He helped shape the group's sound by strongly encouraging them to incorporate a Mellotron into the songs, and his guitar work is prominently featured through solos on \\"The Musical Box\\", \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\", and \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\". He became an early proponent of the guitar tapping technique normally attributed to Eddie Van Halen. Hackett claimed that Van Halen had told him that he learned the technique after attending a Genesis concert in the mid-1970s. Foxtrot (1972) included Hackett's guitar solo composition \\"Horizons\\", which he based on a Suite for Cello by Bach. Selling England by the Pound (1973) features Hackett using tapping and sweep picking, later popularised by Yngwie Malmsteen, both of which are used on \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\". The song \\"Firth of Fifth\\" contains one of Hackett's most well-known guitar solos and has remained a favourite in concert even after Hackett's departure. The writing sessions for The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) was a difficult time not just for Hackett but the entire group, partly due to the personal lives of some members which affected the mood in the group. Hackett explained: \\"Everybody had their own agenda. Some of us were married, some of us had children, some of us were getting divorced. And we were still trying to get it together in the country\\". Hackett, in particular, was going through a divorce from his first wife. While Gabriel wrote the majority of the lyrics, all the band members co-wrote the music. Hackett had picked out \\"The Lamia\\" and \\"Fly on a Windshield\\" as his favourite moments on the album. After recording his debut album Voyage of the Acolyte, Hackett resumed working in Genesis and recorded A Trick of the Tail (1976), the band's first with Collins on lead vocals. Hackett is credited on \\"Dance on a Volcano\\", \\"Entangled\\", and \\"Los Endos\\". The follow-up, Wind & Wuthering (1976), is Hackett's final studio album with the band. He had grown increasingly constricted by his lack of freedom and level of input and was insistent that more of his material be included on the album, but was rebuffed. Of the nine tracks, he was credited with four: \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\", \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\", \\"Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...\\", and \\"...In That Quiet Earth\\". Another track of Hackett's, \\"Please Don't Touch\\", was rehearsed but rejected and replaced with an instrumental, \\"Wot Gorilla?\\". Another, \\"Inside and Out\\" (credited to the entire band), was relegated to the band's first extended play release, Spot the Pigeon (1977). After the Wind & Wuthering tour, Hackett left the band during the mixing stage of the Genesis live album, Seconds Out. His departure was announced in the press during the promotion of the album on 8 October 1977. Hackett has said that he \\"needed autonomy\\".  Reunions  Since Hackett's departure, the 1970‚Äì1975 line-up of Genesis has reunited a handful of times. On 2 October 1982, the group gathered for Six of the Best, a one-off performance held to raise money for Gabriel's WOMAD festival. In 1983, Hackett was joined on stage by Gabriel and Rutherford during a series of shows at the Civic Hall in Guildford, the three performing with Hackett's band. The set list included a mix of Genesis songs, covers, and tracks from their solo careers. In 1998, members of Genesis reunited for a photo session and dinner to celebrate the release of the Genesis Archive 1967‚Äì75 box set. The release featured Hackett and Gabriel re- recording some guitar and vocal parts, respectively. Hackett also participated in the re-recording of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" from The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway for inclusion on the 1999 greatest hits album Turn It On Again: The Hits. In late 2005, the 1970‚Äì1975 line-up gathered to discuss the possibility of a reunion and performing The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.\\"Phil Collins sheds light on possible Genesis reunion and 2005 band meeting\\". 2006. Worldofgenesis.com, 18 April 2006 After Gabriel decided against the idea, Hackett opted out of the project. This led to Banks, Rutherford, and Collins getting together in 2006 for the Turn It On Again: The Tour. Hackett took part in a series of interviews as part of the remastering of the band's discography in 2007, and the interview book Genesis: Chapter and Verse released in the same year. In March 2010, 1970‚Äì1975 line-up of Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio. Hackett appeared at the ceremony with Banks, Rutherford, and Collins, though none of them performed. In 2014, Hackett was featured in the BBC documentary Genesis: Together and Apart which focused on the band and the solo careers of his and the other members. Hackett expressed his displeasure with it following its broadcast, which he described as a \\"biased account of Genesis history\\" which \\"totally ignores\\" his solo work. Hackett was included in the compilation album R-Kive containing Genesis material and tracks from each member's solo career, his contributions are \\"Ace of Wands\\", \\"Every Day\\", and \\"Nomads\\". = 1975‚Äìpresent: Solo career =  1970s  Hackett performing with Genesis in 1977 In October 1975, Hackett released his first solo album, Voyage of the Acolyte. Its original title was Premonitions, but management at Charisma disliked it and suggested Voyage of the Acolyte, to which Hackett agreed. The album features Collins and Rutherford on drums and bass, respectively, and reached No. 26 in the UK and was certified silver. Hackett enjoyed the freedom he had when writing and recording his own album, but was informed by Rutherford and Banks that he could not continue his solo career while in Genesis. Part of one of the album tracks, \\"Shadow of the Hierophant\\", was rehearsed by Genesis during the writing and recording of Foxtrot. Upon its release Hackett resumed working in Genesis. Hackett's first post-Genesis album was Please Don't Touch!, released in 1978. As with Voyage of the Acolyte (1975), much of the material on the album was in the style of progressive rock. It did contain, however, much more vocal work. Hackett, who had never sung lead or backing vocals on a Genesis song, turned over most of the vocals to a number of singers, including folk singer Richie Havens, R&B; singer Randy Crawford, and Steve Walsh of American progressive rock group Kansas. He did provide lead vocals for \\"Carry on Up the Vicarage\\", but they were processed using a \\"laughing gnome\\" vocal effect.[ Please Don't Touch album review]. Allmusic.com. Retrieved 1 October 2006. The album peaked at no. 38 on the UK chart, and no. 103 on the Billboard pop Albums chart in the United States. Having released two albums, Hackett was faced with the task of assembling a band to perform the material live. This became a group with John Hackett on flute, bass pedals, and guitar, Dik Cadbury on bass and vocals, Nick Magnus on keyboards, John Shearer on drums, and Pete Hicks on lead vocals. The subsequent European tour was Hackett's first as a solo performer. It began at the Chateau Neuf in Oslo, Norway on 4 October 1978 and ended with six shows across the UK, culminating at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on 30 October. Hackett used his band on his next album, Spectral Mornings, recorded in the first two months of 1979 in the Netherlands. The album contains various musical styles, including straightforward and progressive rock, folk, and a wider range of instruments such as a Cantonese koto. It reached No. 22 in the UK and No. 138 in the US. The supporting tour included a spot at the Reading Festival in August 1979. Hackett looked back on this period, and the atmosphere within the group, as a hard working and positive one.  1980s  Before Hackett recorded his fourth album Defector, he organised a series of gigs in November 1979, including one in London at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to test out new material. Hackett found the experience of recording Defector as equal to Spectral Mornings and noted the similarity in music between the two albums, though he considered the material on the latter as some of the strongest of his career. Upon its release Defector peaked the UK chart at No. 9, which remains his highest charting album in the country. In the US, the album went to No. 144. The album's tour saw Hackett perform his first solo dates in the US. The tour left Hackett exhausted, and recuperated in Brazil where he spent three months working on new songs. Hackett changed musical directions with his fifth album, Cured (1981). It was recorded without his band which he had worked with since 1979, barring contributions from Magnus and John Hackett, and features Hackett handling all the lead vocals. Instead of using a drummer, Magnus used an electronic Linn drum machine. Although it contained tracks in a progressive rock and classical style for which Hackett was known for, it also showcased a more pop-oriented approach. Released in August 1981, Cured peaked at No. 15 in the UK and No. 169 in the US. The album's tour marked a line-up change with John Hackett and Magnus joined by Chas Cronk on bass and Ian Mosley on drums. The tour for Cured saw the band perform at the 1981 Reading Festival. After promoting Cured, Hackett received an invitation to form a new trio with Keith Emerson and Jack Bruce, shortly followed by an offer to replace Paul Jones and become lead in a new West End musical production. He declined both offers, and went ahead with his next studio album, Highly Strung, put out in April 1983. It would be his last release on Charisma, as growing differences over Hackett's direction, plus management resisting to release an acoustic or live album, caused an end to their partnership. Highly Strung went to No. 16 in the UK, and \\"Cell 151\\" became a minor hit there. In 1983, Hackett had secured a deal with Lamborghini Records which supported the release of his seventh album, Bay of Kings, containing classical guitar compositions. The album went to No. 70 in the UK. This was followed, in August 1984, with Hackett returning to rock music in his next release, Till We Have Faces. It demonstrated a merge of his guitar with influences of Brazilian percussion and world music. The album peaked at No. 54 in the UK. In 1985, Hackett formed the supergroup GTR with veteran Yes and Asia guitarist Steve Howe. The group released a gold-selling album, produced by Yes/Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes. The album included \\"When the Heart Rules the Mind\\", which hit number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest charting US single in Hackett's career. Hackett soon left GTR over financial and management squabbles. Hackett's main reason for ending GTR was the lack of funds to continue the project, and his growing desire to pursue a less mainstream career path. Among them included charity and film work, including a jingle for an airline. In 1986, Hackett also participated with former Yardbirds members Chris Dreja, Paul Samwell-Smith and Jim McCarty on their Box of Frogs project second album Strange Land together with Jimmy Page, Ian Dury and Graham Parker on tracks, \\"I Keep Calling\\", \\"20/20 Vision\\" and \\"Average\\". In 1987, Hackett contributed to the Genesis orchestral album We Know What We Like: The Music of Genesis, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra with arranger and conductor David Palmer. After GTR, Hackett returned to the studio and recorded a new solo album, Momentum. The troubles he had faced in GTR led Hackett to rate the album as \\"a theraputic, cathartic thing\\" as he welcomed the return to recording \\"music without props\\". Released in March 1988, his tour across Europe to promote the album was met with large and enthusiastic crowds which included gigs in Estonia, Russia, and the Soviet Union. In late 1989, Hackett was the helm of the charity single \\"Sailing\\", a cover of Rod Stewart's 1975 hit released under the name Rock Against Repatriation. It was to raise money and awareness of Asian groups that left the difficult conditions of their home but were refused entry into Western countries. Released as a single in 1990, the song included Brian May, the Moody Blues, Mike Rutherford, Phil Manzanera, and Godley & Creme. In the 1980s he also made a special appearance on Brazilian singer Ritchie's first album, named Voo de Cora√ß√£o (1983). He is co-author of the song \\"A Mulher Invis√≠vel\\" (1984), from the 2nd LP of the countryman living in Brazil and also played guitar on the track \\"Meantime\\" (a poem by Fernando Pessoa music by Ritchie) on the 4th LP of the artist, Loucura e M√°gica (1987).  1990s  Hackett at the concert in Germany, 2005 In 1992, Hackett resumed touring for the first time in six years, which also saw his return to activity in the US in several years. His reason for the prolonged absence was down to his involvement in various legal issues which prevented him from touring there. Hackett was pleased that his 1992 North American tour was well attended, and used it to test the strength of some new material that he had been working on to an audience, as well as to promote his first live album, Time Lapse. 1992 also saw the release of The Unauthorised Biography, a compilation album including two previously unreleased tracks that Hackett co-wrote with Brian May, and Hackett's acoustic performance with the London Chamber Orchestra with a program of Vivaldi. He picked the show as a career highlight. In May 1993, Hackett released his tenth studio album, Guitar Noir. It includes the track \\"Walking Away from Rainbows\\", which lyrically dealt with Hackett's career decision of leaving mainstream music and pursuing what he wishes. Shortly after its release Hackett considered the album \\"the most crucial thing I've ever done. It's been the thing I've most wanted to do as an album because I've been reduced to silence for so long.\\" Hackett followed this with a blues album, Blues with a Feeling (1994), formed of covers and original material penned by him and his group. For his next album, Hackett decided to rework a selection of Genesis tracks with various guest musicians. This was released in 1996 as Genesis Revisited, which peaked at No. 95 in the UK. It includes \\"D√©j√† Vu\\", a track Hackett wrote with Peter Gabriel in 1973 during the Selling England by the Pound sessions that had remained unfinished. In retrospect, Hackett said that much of the album made him \\"wince\\", and that he can \\"hear the struggles\\". Hackett promoted the album with two shows in Tokyo in December 1996 with John Wetton, Chester Thompson, Ian McDonald, and Julian Colbeck. The concerts were recorded and filmed, later released as The Tokyo Tapes in 1998. In April 1997 he released the neo-classical influenced A Midsummer Night's Dream with accompaniments from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. It reached the top 10 UK classical chart. This marked the beginning of keyboardist, arranger, and producer Roger King taking a more prominent role on Hackett's future albums and live shows. In 1999, Hackett released his fourteenth studio album, Darktown. The album is named after a book, and the music and lyrical ideas took eight years to finalise. Hackett looked back on the album as one with lyrical themes that he had not been \\"brave enough\\" to present before. It went to No. 156 in the UK.  2000s  Steve Hackett in Warsaw (2006) In 2000, Hackett and his brother John released Sketches of Satie, a tribute album to the French composer Erik Satie with the compositions rearranged for flute and guitar. Hackett said that he had not worked on a project with John for some time and had missed playing with him, leading to his manager Billy Budis to suggest an album of Satie's music. Later in 2000, an album of Hackett's with material originally put together in 1986 but put on the shelf, was released as Feedback 86. A portion of the material was for a second GTR album, and features appearances by Brian May. In 2001, Hackett contributed instrumental music to the score of Outwitting Hitler, a documentary about a Holocaust survivor. It was his first venture into soundtrack work, and had one weekend to finish it. He used themes that he had previously released with some originally intended for his future guitar/orchestra album Metamorpheus (2005). In 2003, Hackett released To Watch the Storms, his first studio album in four years and his first completed in his new recording studio, Crown Studios. It also marked his return to progressive rock music, and unlike his several previous records the material was put together within three months. His next solo release was the orchestral Metamorpheus (2005) with the Underworld Orchestra, which dates back to 1997 when Hackett recorded his guitar parts for the songs. This was followed by the rock album Wild Orchids (2006), followed by Tribute (2007), a classical album showcasing original pieces and renditions of those by Bach, Byrd, Barrios, and Andr√©s Segovia. The recording of Out of the Tunnel's Mouth (2009), was met with various legal issues, including those instigated by Poor and his former manager Billy Budis regarding its rights and attempt to block its release, to prevent Hackett from playing on records by other artists, and the ownership of Hackett's catalogue on Camino Records. A court decision allowed Hackett to \\"be back in the record business\\", and to release Out of the Tunnel's Mouth on his new label Wolfwork Records in October 2009. The album was recorded at Hackett's own flat rather than a professional studio. It features contributions to former Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips and Yes bassist Chris Squire. Hackett toured the album. In August 2009, an official, authorised biography, Sketches of Hackett by Alan Hewitt, was released. The first edition hardback includes a bonus DVD with a 90-minute interview.  2010s  On 15 March 2010, Genesis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Hackett making a rare appearance alongside Collins, Banks and Rutherford at the ceremony, though they did not perform together. Hackett, in recent years, has put on record his willingness to participate in a reunion. A planned reunion of the classic 1970s Genesis line-up fell apart in 2007 when Peter Gabriel expressed reservations, and subsequently Hackett dropped out in deference to the Genesis 'trio' line-up, as opposed to the four-piece. In 2011, Hackett released his 24th studio album Beyond the Shrouded Horizon (no. 133 in the UK album chart). In 2012 he went on tour to promote the album in the UK. In 2012, Hackett and Chris Squire again collaborated to release the album A Life Within a Day under the name of Squackett. Hackett performing Genesis Revisited in 2013 Hackett released Genesis Revisited II in October 2012. His main reason to revisit the project was the desire to perform the material live once more, and got various musicians to perform the songs which cover material by Genesis and some solo material. Involved was former Genesis lead vocalist Ray Wilson. The album was met with enthusiasm from the public which resulted in Hackett making a stronger chart presence and a sell out supporting tour in the UK. The album reached No. 24 in the UK. In June 2013, both Genesis Revisited albums were awarded a Japanese Gold Sales Award for 100,000 copies sold. The UK tour included a show at Hammersmith Apollo, London which won Hackett the Event of the Year Award at the 2013 Progressive Music Awards. The show was released on CD and DVD as Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith which reached No. 58 in the UK. Hackett completed a second tour with a rearranged setlist in 2014 which spawned Genesis Revisited: Live at the Royal Albert Hall. This reached No. 80 in the UK. Following the success of the Genesis Revisited tours, Hackett has considered himself as \\"the keeper of the flame of the early work\\" of Genesis. In March 2015, Hackett released Wolflight. It reached No. 31 in the UK. Wolflight also contain Chris Squire's last studio recording with the track \\"Love Song to a Vampire\\". In September 2015, the independent music company Wienerworld released The Man, The Music, a documentary on Hackett's career that went to No. 5 on the UK DVD chart. That October, Universal/Virgin released Premonitions: The Charisma Years 1975‚Äì1983, a 14-disc box set of his first six studio albums with extra material including live recordings and new remixes by Steven Wilson. Hackett's solo album The Night Siren (no. 28 UK album chart) was released in March 2017 and entered top 40 in six international album charts. The album continues the exploration of world music/progressive rock, and also contains influences from the Beatles' psychedelia period and classic science fiction. In October Hackett won the \\"Chris Squire Virtuoso\\" award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards. In October 2018, Hackett underwent a UK tour which featured his band performing Genesis and solo tracks with the 41-piece Heart of England Symhpony Orchestra, conducted by Bradley Tkachuk. Tkachuk and his brother took the orchestral arrangements that they had produced for a concert that Hackett performed in Buffalo, New York in 2017, which also featured an orchestra on stage, as the basis for the orchestral parts used for the tour, including those from Hackett's collaboration with the Icelandic band Todmobile. A live album and concert film from the tour was released in 2019, entitled at the Royal Festival Hall, London was released in 2019, entitled Genesis Revisited Band & Orchestra: Live at the Royal Festival Hall. Hackett released his latest album, At the Edge of Light, in January 2019. The album reached no 28 in the UK and marked Hacketts 10th solo album on the UK top 40 album charts since his solo debut in 1975. In 2019, Hackett toured with a set comprising Selling England by the Pound performed in its entirety with other Genesis songs, plus tracks from At the Edge of Light and Spectral Mornings to commemorate the latter's fortieth anniversary. The show at London's Hammersmith Apollo, the last of the tour will be released as a live album and concert film on 25 September 2020, entitled Selling England by the Pound & Spectral Mornings: Live at Hammersmith. 2020s In 2020, Hackett rescheduled his upcoming tours due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He will resume touring in April 2021. In July 2020, Hackett released an autobiography, A Genesis in My Bed. In an interview promoting the book, he revealed that he is collaborating with Roger King on an acoustic album with an orchestra named Under a Mediterranean Sky, plus a rock album with world music influences which is roughly half complete.  Personal life  Hackett has been married three times. His first was to Ellen Busse in 1972 and the couple had one son, Oliver (b. 1974). The marriage ended in a divorce in 1974. In 1981, Hackett married Brazilian painter and jewellery artist Kim Poor, who designed many of his future album covers. They divorced in 2007, which led Poor to file a legal case against Hackett, claiming she was a joint owner of Stephen Hackett Ltd., which was where all future royalties from Genesis songs he had written and performed were paid into. In 2006, Hackett arranged for all royalties to be paid directly to him rather than the company, which Poor argued is in breach of their agreement and is entitled to a share of the money. Poor also challenged Hackett's right to make new albums independently, causing further issues. The case was settled in 2010. In June 2011, Hackett married author Jo Lehmann, who has written lyrics on several of Hackett's songs. Jo's sister Amanda is a singer, songwriter, and musician who has performed on several of Hackett's songs and tours since 2009.

He was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland. Life He was born at Aberdalgie in the parish of Abernethy, Perthshire, on 13 January 1831, was the son of David Bruce, a farmer. His elder brother was the Presbyterian minister David Bruce.Ewing's Annals of the Free Church, reproduced at http://ecclegen.com- URL: http://ecclegen.com/ministers-b Date accessed: 06/09/2017 He was educated at Auchterarder parish school. At the Disruption of 1843 his father relocated with his family to Edinburgh. Bruce entered Edinburgh University in 1845 and the divinity hall of the Free Church of Scotland in 1849. His early faith was subjected to severe trials during his studies, and he was at times 'precipitated down to the ground floor of the primaeval abyss.' These doubts, however, he surmounted and entered the Free Church ministry. After acting as assistant, first at Ancrum and then at Lochwinnoch, he was called to Cardross in Dumbartonshire in 1859. In 1868, he was translated to the east Free Church at Broughty Ferry in Forfarshire, and in 1871 he published his studies on the gospels entitled The Training of the Twelve, which established his reputation as a biblical scholar and a writer of ability. They were originally delivered from the Cardross pulpit, and reached a second edition in 1877. In 1874, Bruce was Cunningham lecturer, taking as his subject The Humiliation of Christ (Edinburgh, 1876, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1881); and in 1875, on the death of Patrick Fairbairn, he was appointed to the chair of apologetics and New Testament exegesis in the Free Church Hall at Glasgow. In the twenty-four years during which he occupied this chair he exercised the strongest influence over students, both from his wide knowledge and on account of the magnetism of his mind. At the same time he published a number of exegetical works which established his fame with a wider circle. Among the more noteworthy were St. Paul's Conception of Christianity (1894), his 'Commentary on the Synoptic Gospels' in the Expositor's Greek Testament (1897), and The Epistle to the Hebrews: the First Apology for Christianity (1899). He and William Robertson Smith were the first Scottish scholars whose authority was regarded with respect among German biblical critics. The boldness of Bruce's views was not, however, entirely pleasing to his colleagues in the Free Church. In 1889, he published The Kingdom of God; or, Christ's Teachings according to the Synoptic Gospels (Edinburgh, 8vo), a work which gave rise to considerable criticism owing to his treatment of the inspired writings. In 1890, the tendency of his views and those of Dr. Marcus Dods was considered by the general assembly, but that body came to the conclusion that while some of their statements had been unguarded, their writings were not at variance with the standards of the church (, Reply to Letter of Professor Blaikie, 1890 ; Kere, Vivisection in Theology, 1890 ; Richardson, Dr. Bruce on the Kingdom of God, 1890 ; The Case Stated, 1890). Bruce rendered great services to the music of his church. He acted as convener of the hymnal committees which issued the 'Free Church Hymn Book' in 1882, and in 1898 the 'Church Hymnary' for all the Scottish presbyterian churches. He was Gifford lecturer in Glasgow University for 1896-7, choosing as his subjects 'The Providential Order of the World' (London, 1897, 8vo) and 'The Moral Order of the World in Ancient and Modern Thought' (London, 1899, 8vo). From 1894 he assisted Canon T. K. Cheyne in editing the 'Theological Translation Library.' Bruce died on 7 August 1899 at 32 Hamilton Park Terrace, Glasgow, and was buried on 10 August at Broughty Ferry. Family In 1860 he married Jane Hunter Walker (1832-1900), daughter of James Walker of Fodderslee in Roxburghshire. She survived him with a son David, a Glasgow writer, partner in the firm of Mitchell & Bruce, and a daughter, who married Milward Valentine of Manchester and New York.

In this installment, the Shee have left Albia in a spaceship, the Shee Ark, to search for a more spherical world. The Ark was abandoned by the Shee because a meteor hit the ship, but the infrastructure still remains in working order. There are 6 main \\"metarooms\\" on the ship; the Norn Terranium, Grendel Jungle, Ettin Desert, Marine area, Bridge, and Engineering Room. The Norn Terranium is where you can safely hatch and raise your norns. The Grendel Jungle is where the Grendel mother (egg-layer) is, and it is well suited for Grendels. The Ettin Desert is where the Ettin mother is; it is a dry, harsh environment for all creatures. The Bridge is where you will find the most gadgets, and also the most Ettins. The Engineering Room is where the Agent Creator is, with which you can create objects for your world. Grendels are now vicious, unlike the original Creatures Grendels; these Grendels enjoy hunting down, and then killing norns. The Ettins, which first appeared in Creatures 2, love gathering gadgets and taking them back to the Ettin Desert. Creatures 3 runs on the CAOS engine, making it highly moddable, but now it is retired and outdated.

It features three species: the cute, dependent Norns, the cantankerous Grendels and the industrious Ettins. The game tries to simulate life, and includes a complex two-dimensional ecology of plants, animals and insects, which provide the environment for the three main species to live and develop in. The player interacts with the world using a hand-shaped cursor, and tries to encourage the creatures' development by manipulating various objects around the world, guiding the creatures using the cursor and encouraging the creatures to speak. Many new gameplay features included in Creatures 2 not present in the original game include a new physics model and a global weather system, along with brand new applets and a world twice the size of the Creatures 1 world. The executable file for the game was in fact an interpreter for its scripting language, thus allowing users to make total conversions or derivative works from the game.  Gameplay  Like the other games in the series, Creatures 2 is mostly open-ended, with no predetermined goals, allowing the player to raise Norns at their own pace. In each new world, the player begins in the incubator cavern area. The hatchery, one of the game's in-built applets, allows the player to add Norn eggs to the world, which can be hatched via the incubator. Norns may also be downloaded from the internet and imported in to use in the game. Once Norns reach adolescence at around an hour old, they are ready to breed, and female Norns will begin an oestrogen cycle. When Norns mate, there is a long kissing sound with a pop at the end ‚Äì known as a kisspop. Like real life, not all mating results in a pregnancy. The Norn reproductive process can be monitored via the Breeder's Kit. At the beginning, the player is only able to navigate a small area of Albia. As their Norns explore the world, however, more areas will be able to visited. If a Norn falls into water and is picked up, it cannot be placed in an unvisited area. Like the previous game, every plant, animal and insect in Albia is a separate system called an autonomous agent, or just \\"agent\\" for short. Many user- created agents have been made, which can be injected into the world using the Injector Kit applet, which also includes an analysis page giving the opportunity to check new objects for potentially harmful contents before injecting them. Albia, the world in which Creatures 2 is set, is a vast disc- world filled with a wide variety of flora, ranging from the Cacti that inhabit the desert to the exclusive mushroom-like Gelsemium plant that can only be found in a single cavern. Albia is also home to a substantial amount of animal life, such as bees which pollinate flowers and create honey, and Zander fish, which provide a food source for creatures near the oceans. Scattered throughout the world are various seed launchers, which can be used to replenish stocks if any life-forms become extinct. Albia also has four seasons: Spring, Summer, Winter and Autumn, and boasts its very own climate, with weather such as snow mainly occurring during the colder months, and rain mostly during the Spring. The game also has an on-screen thermometer, allowing the player to monitor Albia's temperature at all times.  Development  Creatures 2's release was widely anticipated. It is likely that around 450,000 copies of the original Creatures had been sold by the time the game was released, and a huge following had developed behind it. The \\"Early Adoption Program\\", a promotion where 250 copies of Creatures 2 were given away prior to its official release in September 1998, was scheduled to begin in July 1998, but was pushed back as the game was not close to release quality at the point at which the EAP was scheduled to start. In the end, most received their copies several weeks after the release date. Upon release, the game suffered from numerous flaws, such as a deficient Norn genome that lead to a condition dubbed \\"One Hour Stupidity Syndrome (OHSS)\\", which caused Norns to forget basic survival skills such as eating and sleeping. The task of creating the new Norn genome was given to Sandra Linkletter (Slink), who was also a member of the Creatures community. During development, many problems emerged, most likely due to disagreements between Slink and the Creatures 2 team. Slink later claimed that her design had been compromised by the geneticist brought on to finish her work, Eric Goodwin, and later accused Cyberlife of deriving their update from hers. Cyberlife later released a patch with an improved genome after several weeks had passed. Several users also created improved Norn genomes, such as the Canny Norn genome created by Chris Double and Lis Morris.

It is the first known medieval accusation against Jews of ritual murder. William was an apprentice tanner who regularly came into contact with Jews and visited their homes as part of his trade. His death was unsolved; the local community of Norwich attributed the boy's death to the Jews, though the local authorities would not convict them for lack of proof. William was shortly thereafter acclaimed as a saint in Norwich, with miracles attributed to him. William's story was told in The Life and Miracles of St. William of Norwich, a multi-volume Latin work by Thomas of Monmouth, a monk in the Norwich Benedictine monastery. Thomas started The Life in 1149/50; he completed volume 7 by 1173. Augustus Jessopp (1823‚Äì1914), one of the editors of the first printed edition of Thomas' work, describes Thomas as belonging to the class of those who are \\"deceivers and being deceived.\\" The murder Since most information about William's life comes only from Thomas, it is difficult to distinguish the facts of the case from the story of martyrdom created around it by Thomas. Thomas wrote that William was born on 2 February 1132 to a local Anglo-Saxon couple, Wenstan and Elviva. He was apprenticed to a skinner and tanner of hides, often dealing with local Jews. Shortly before his murder, William's mother was approached by a man who claimed to be a cook working for the Archdeacon of Norwich. He offered William a job in the Archdeacon's kitchens. William's mother was paid three shillings to let her son go. William later visited his aunt in the company of this man. His aunt was apparently suspicious, and asked her daughter to follow them after they left. They were then seen entering the house of a local Jew. This was the last time William was seen alive; it was Holy Tuesday. On Holy Saturday, the twelve-year-old William's body was found in Mousehold Heath, part of Thorpe Wood, outside Norwich. A local nun saw the body, but did not initially contact anyone. A forester named Henry de Sprowston then came across it. He noted injuries which suggested a violent death and the fact that the boy appeared to have been gagged with a wooden teasel. William was wearing a jacket and shoes. After consultation with the local priest, it was decided to bury the body on Easter Monday. In the meanwhile, local people came to look at it, and William was recognised. The body was then buried at the murder site, and the following day, members of William's family, one of whom was a priest, arrived to confirm the identity of the body. They exhumed it and then reburied it with proper ceremony. The Christians of Norwich appeared to have quickly blamed the local Jews for this crime, and to have demanded justice from the local ecclesiastical court. Members of the Jewish community were asked to attend the court and submit to a trial by ordeal, but the local sheriff, John de Chesney, advised them that the ecclesiastical court had no jurisdiction over them, as they were not Christians. He then took the Jews into protection in the castle. After the situation had calmed down, they returned to their homes. The issue was revived two years later, when a member of the Jewish community was murdered in an unrelated incident. King Stephen agreed to look into the matter, but later decided to let it drop. In the meanwhile, William's body had been moved to the monks' cemetery. Some of the local clergy attempted to create a cult around him as a martyr, but this plan did not succeed. There is no evidence that the initial accusations against the Jews implied that the murder was related to ritual activity of any kind, but as the cult developed, so did the story of how and why he was killed. =Thomas' version of events= The crucifixion of William depicted on a rood screen in Holy Trinity church, Loddon, Norfolk Thomas of Monmouth arrived in Norwich around 1150. He decided to investigate the murder by interviewing surviving witnesses. He also spoke to people identified as \\"converted Jews\\" who provided him with inside information about events within the Jewish community. He wrote up his account of the crime in the book The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich. In Thomas of Monmouth's account, of the murder he writes that ‚Äúhaving shaved his head, they stabbed it with countless thornpoints, and made the blood come horribly from the wounds they made. . . some of those present ad judged him to be fixed to a cross in mockery of the Lord's Passion . . .‚Äù William's body was later said to have been found in Thorpe Wood with a crown of thorns atop his head. One convert, called Theobald of Cambridge, told Thomas that there was a written prophecy which stated that the Jews would regain control of Israel if they sacrificed a Christian child each year. Every year, Jewish leaders met in Narbonne to decide who would be asked to perform the sacrifice; in 1144, the Jews of Norwich were assigned the task. According to Thomas, the man who claimed to be a cook had been employed to entice William into the house where the sacrifice would occur. William was initially treated well, but was then bound, gagged and suspended in a cruciform position in a room where he was tortured and murdered in a manner imitating the Crucifixion of Jesus: the Jews lacerated his head with thorns and pierced his side. His body was then dumped in the nearby woods. Thomas supports this claim by saying that one converted Jew told him that there was an argument over how to dispose of the body. He also says that a Christian servant woman glimpsed the child through a chink in a door. Another man is said to have confessed on his deathbed, years after the events, that he saw a group of Jews transporting a body on a horse in the woods. Context =The Jews in Norwich= The Jewish community is thought to have been established in Norwich by 1135, only nine years before the murder (though one Jew called 'Isaac' is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086). Most lived in a Jewish quarter or \\"Jewry\\", located in what is now the Haymarket and White Lion Street. The Jews were a French-speaking community, like the recently established Norman aristocracy and they were closely associated with them. The \\"Jewry\\" was very close to Norwich Castle, a pattern seen in other English towns where Jews were under the protection of the local aristocracy.Carole Rawcliffe, Richard George Wilson, Medieval Norwich, Continuum International, 2006, p.18. William's family were local Anglo-Saxons, several of whom were married priests following local tradition.Catherine Cubbit, Images of St. Peter: The Clergy and the Religious Life in Anglo-Saxon England in Paul Cavill (ed), The Christian Tradition in Anglo-Saxon England, p. 52. Conflicts with the Norman authorities may have been mediated through accusations against the \\"alien\\" Jews protected by the foreign Norman rulers themselves. Tensions were particularly strong in the chaotic reign of King Stephen (known as The Anarchy) when the murder occurred. Thomas of Monmouth claims that the sheriff was bribed by the Jews to protect them. There may also have been background conflicts between the cathedral, the sheriff and local people about rights in the city and suburbs. Thomas repeatedly invokes God as a source of protection for the people against the corrupt Norman sheriffs, claiming that John de Chesney, the sheriff who protected the Jews, was punished with internal bleeding. =Cult= The site of the chapel consecrated to William on Mousehold Heath (2010). The chapel was demolished during the English Reformation; its remains are listed as a Scheduled monument The wish of the clergy ‚Äì in particular, William de Turbeville (Bishop of Norwich 1146‚Äì74) ‚Äì to establish a cultus may have been partly financially motivated. De Turbeville encouraged Thomas of Monmouth to write his book. After being buried in the monk's cemetery, the body of William was moved to progressively more prestigious places in the church, being placed in the chapterhouse in 1150 and close to the High Altar in 1151. Thomas devotes most of his book not to the crime, but to the evidence for William's sanctity, including mysterious lights seen around the body itself and miraculous cures effected on local devotees. Thomas admits that some of the clergy, notably the Prior, Elias, were opposed to the cult on the grounds that there was little evidence of William's piety or martyrdom. Thomas actively promoted the claims by providing evidence of visions of William and miracles. Historian Paul Dalton states that the cult of William was predominantly \\"protective and pacificatory\\" in character, having similarities to that of another child saint, Faith of Conques. Despite its origins, the cult itself was not associated with the promotion of anti-Jewish activity. The cult was a minor one even at its height. There is little evidence of a flourishing cult of William in Norwich ‚Äì surviving financial records listing offerings made at his shrine at Norwich Cathedral suggest that, although its fortunes waxed and waned, for much of its history there were few pilgrims, although offerings continued to be made until at least 1521. A temporary boost to the shrine's popularity occurred after 1376, when William was adopted by the Norwich Peltier's Guild, whose annual service at the Cathedral included a child who played the part of William. There was also a scholars' guild dedicated to St William in the Norfolk town of Lynn. The rood screen of St John's Church Garboldisham Images of William as a martyr were created for some churches, generally in the vicinity of Norwich. A panel of painted oak, depicting both William and Agatha of Sicily, is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; William is shown holding a hammer and with three nails in his head. The panel was formerly part of a rood screen at the Norwich Church of St John Maddermarket. The screen was commissioned by Ralph Segrym (died 1472), a merchant who became a Member of Parliament and Mayor of Norwich. William is depicted on the rood screens of a number of other Norfolk churches. St Mary's church, Worstead and St John's Church, Garboldisham depict William hold nails. The screen in Holy Trinity Church in Loddon depicts William being crucified. =Aftermath= As a result of the feelings generated by the William ritual murder story and subsequent intervention by the authorities on behalf of the accused, the growing suspicion of collusion between the ruling class and Jews fuelled the general anti-Jewish and anti-King Stephen mood of the population. After Thomas of Monmouth's version of William's death circulated a number of other unsolved child murders were attributed to Jewish conspiracies, including Harold of Gloucester (d. 1168) and Robert of Bury (d. 1181). The best-known of these was Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln (d. 1255). This became known as the blood libel. By the reign of Richard the Lionheart attitudes towards Jews had become increasingly intolerant. This, in conjunction with the increase in national opinion in favour of a Crusade, and the conflation of all non-Christians in the Medieval Christian imagination, led to the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of Richard in 1189 being attacked by the crowd.Flori, Jean, Richard Coeur de Lion: le roi-chevalier, Paris: Biographie Payot, 1999, pp.94-5. A widespread attack began on the Jewish population, most notably in London and York, leading to massacres of Jews at London and York. The attacks were soon followed by others throughout England. When the local nobility of Norwich attempted to quash these activities, the local yeomanry and peasantry revolted against the lords and attacked their supporters, especially Norwich's Jewish community. On 6 February 1190, all Norwich Jews who didn't escape to the support of the local castle were slaughtered in their village. Hostility against Jews increased in the area until in 1290, Jews were expelled from all of England to Spain, Italy, Greece and elsewhere. Jews were not officially allowed to settle in England again until sometime after 1655, when Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell commissioned the Whitehall Conference to debate the proposals made by Menasseh ben Israel. While the Conference reached no verdict, it is seen as the beginning of readmission. Modern theories of the crime A map of medieval Norwich reproduced in Jessopp and James' edition of the Life. The \\"Jewry\\" is to the left of the castle in the centre, part of the \\"New Town\\" area on the other side of the town from the monastery and the wood. The story of William's supposed martyrdom in a Jewish conspiracy persisted for many centuries. As late as 1853, the author Susan Swain Madders, in her book on the history of Norwich, attributes William's death to a murderous conspiracy of \\"the Jews, then the leading doctors, merchants and scholars of the day\\". She also repeats the story that they escaped punishment \\"by some clever monetary arrangement with the authorities\\". Thomas of Monmouth's account of William's life was published in 1896 in an edition by Augustus Jessopp and M. R. James. James's introduction to the book is the first modern analysis of the evidence provided by Thomas. James notes that Thomas is keen to prove the truth of his version of events by citing witnesses to build up a consistent account. He argues that some testimonies seem to be pure invention, others are unreliable, but that some appear to describe real events, though facts are clearly being manipulated to fit the story. James dismisses the claim of planned ritual murder as a fantasy, which only emerges some years after the crime, promoted by the convert Theobald, keen to ingratiate himself with the Christian community. Independent support is very flimsy, such as the servant who is supposed to have glimpsed a child through a crack in the door, but did not report this until interviewed by Thomas years later. James suggests several possibilities: 1. an accident in the woods; 2. a murder by a Christian who arranged the scene to cast blame on Jews; 3. a murder by an unknown person that was blamed on Jews for reasons unrelated to the crime itself; 4. accidental or deliberate killing by a Jew that was then covered up by the Jewish community who feared they would all be blamed. James thinks that all these are possible, including that a \\"deranged or superstitious\\" Jew might have killed William in a quasi-ritual way. He says that the convert Theobald himself is a possible suspect. In an 1897 review of James' book Joseph Jacobs in the Jewish Quarterly Review argued that William's own family were the most likely suspects, speculating that they had held a mock crucifixion over Easter during which William fell into a \\"cataleptic\\" trance and died as a result of burial. Jacobs argues that it would make no sense for Jews to hide the body in Thorpe Wood, as they would have had to carry it through the whole of the Christian part of the town to get there.Jacobs, J., The Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 9, 1 July 1897, pp.749-55. According to a 2005 paper by Raphael Langham, Jacobs provided \\"no evidence\\" for his speculation about a family crucifixion. In 1933 Cecil Roth argued that a different type of mock crucifixion may have led to the accusations against Jews, because of a masquerade involving the mock execution of Haman enacted by the Jews at Purim. In 1964 Marion Anderson developed this idea, combining it with Thomas's original arguments. She suggests that William had been told not to associate with Jews following one such masquerade; he was then kidnapped and tortured by the Jews to find out why they were being ostracised. He died as a result and the body was disposed of. In 1967, Vivian Lipman argued that the murder was a sex crime, suggesting that Thomas's comment that William was wearing a \\"jacket\\" and \\"shoes\\" implied that the boy's body was naked below the waist. It was probably perpetrated by the man who represented himself as a cook, and who enticed William away from his family to commit the crime. This man was never identified by Thomas and mysteriously disappears from the story without explanation. In 1984, Gavin I. Langmuir endorsed Lipman's \\"sane\\" account, dismissing Anderson's theories and criticising both James' and Jacobs' speculations, adding that Theobald was an unlikely suspect as he appears to have been in Cambridge when the murder was committed. In 1988, Zefirah Rokeah nevertheless revived James' suggestion that Theobald was the killer. In 1997, John McCulloh followed Lipman in arguing that it was a sadistic sex crime. Raphael Langham, writing in 2005, believed that Theobald was a disturbed individual with a hatred of his own community and thus the most likely killer. In 2015, E. M. Rose's investigation of the subject, The Murder of William of NorwichOxford University Press: The Murder of William of Norwich retrieved October 4, 2016 received the 2016 Ralph Waldo Emerson Award of the Phi Beta Kappa Society for \\"a scholarly study that contributes significantly to interpretation of the intellectual and cultural condition of humanity\\"Phi Beta Kappa Society: 2016 Book Award Winners retrieved October 4, 2016 and was named a \\"Top Ten Book in History\\" by The Sunday Times (London).The Sunday Times: REVIEW: The Murder of William of Norwich by Dan Jones, 26 July 2015 retrieved October 4, 2016 Rose points out that road robberies and kidnappings gone wrong were a frequent cause of death in the region during Stephen's reign, when the Crown struggled to safeguard the roads, and could offer another explanation of William's death.

(Source: Visitation of Essex (1632) 'Tyndall'). That family also quartered their arms with those of Deane, now borne by the Tindal family (see below, within the illustration of Rev Nicolas Tindal). Image created by Martin Goldstraw, Cheshire Heraldry Tyndall (the original spelling, also Tyndale, \\"Tindol\\",Tyndal, Tindall, Tindal, Tindale, Tindle, Tindell, Tindill, and Tindel) is the name of an English family taken from the land they held as tenants in chief of the Kings of England and Scotland in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries: Tynedale, or the valley of the Tyne, in Northumberland. With origins in the ancient Anglo Saxon nobility of Northumbria, the Royal Scottish House of Dunkeld and the Anglo- Norman nobility, they have contributed courtiers, judges, writers, historians, sailors, airmen, scientists and philosophers to the history of England, Ireland and the new world. Two members of the family were offered, and declined, the throne of Bohemia in the 15th century and one of their number, William Tyndale, was the first modern translator of the Bible into English and one of the most important figures in the evolution of the modern language. The family is spread today throughout the British Isles and the English speaking world. Origins The first member of the family known by this name was Uchtred, Lord of Tyndale, who married Bethoc Canmore, daughter of Donald III, King of Scots from 1093‚Äì1099.Young, Alan, Robert the Bruce's Rivals: The Comyns, 1213‚Äì1314, (East Linton, 1997), pp15 - His name, the period of his life and his lands and position suggest a kinship with the Anglo Saxon Earls of Northumbria, one of whom was Uchtred the Bold, Earl from 1006 to 1016. These Earls, in turn, were descended from the Saxon Kings of Northumbria. Whilst the Tyndales soon adopted the use of the Norman 'de', this does not necessarily suggest the family was Norman in the male line; the Saxon family of Woolesley, for example, used 'de' throughout this period.Burke's Peerage (2005) 'Woolesley Baronets' Nevertheless, the Tyndales married and integrated into the Norman nobility within the earliest period of their recorded history. =Barony of Tindale= The earliest feudal records indicate that an Adam de Tindale was the feudal Baron of South Tyne-dale and of Langeley/Langley Castle, both in the county of Northumberland. The pipe rolls are written in Latin, which explains the use of 'i' rather than 'y' in the name; there is no 'y' in Latin. The Barony had been held by his father or grandfather by the service of one knight's fee, in the time of Henry I. Considering the dates, his position and territorial designation, it is probable that this Baron was either the son or grandson of Uchtred, Lord of Tyndale and Princess Bethoc of Scotland. Adam was succeeded by his son, Adam, who held the Barony during the reign of Richard I of England, paid 100 pounds for his relief, with livery of his land, in 1194 and appears to have died in 1224.National Archives (UK): Pipe Rolls for Northumberland He left two daughters, who became co-heirs to the Tindale Barony and to Langley Castle. The elder, Philippa, married Adam Nicholas de Bolteby and conveyed to her husband the Barony of South Tyne-dale. It passed through inheritance in the female line to the family of Lucy and, later, to the Earls of Northumberland. The Barony of Langley and its associated manor continue to modern times as an originally feudal Prescriptive Barony (not a Peerage), and an extensive series of baronial and manorial records are maintained in the National Archives (UK). =\\"Tindale\\" in the Peerage= Langley Castle, seat of Baron Adam de Tindale before being extended and rebuilt The Parliamentary Barony, Baron Scott of Tindale in Northumberland, was created in 1663 for the ill-fated Duke of Monmouth, and 1st Duke of Buccleuch, James Scott, the illegitimate son of King Charles II. This title was put under attainder, upon his execution for treason in 1685, but later restored, together with the Earldom of Doncaster in 1743. There is, however, a legend that King James II did not have him executed but exiled to France, where he became known as the Man in the Iron Mask.Shaw, Samuel in 'Duke of Monmouth: Man in the Iron Mask' in Oxford Journals (Oxford, 1870) Vol s4-V, No 120. Another Barony of Tyndale was created in 1688 as the junior title of the Radclyffe Earl of Derwentwater and in 1716 fell under attainder on his execution for treason for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1715. From the Middle Ages to the early modern era The second son of the first Baron Adam de Tindale, Robert, settled at Tansover in Northamptonshire in the time of Edward I. Some of the (later) genealogies and secondary sources for the family from this period are written in English and use 'Tyndale', for the reasons posited above.Rudder, Samuel (1779) A New History of Gloucestershire, though the Nichols genealogy uses 'Tindale' for this period. The more contemporary 'Visitation of Essex' uses 'Tyndall', a spelling used below. The first that is known of the family after their migration to Northamptonshire was the enlargement of their estates through marriage into the Deane family. The Deanes were, from the earliest generations, intimately connected with the Tyndall family. The elder son of Robert de Tyndall of Talsover married the heiress of that family and inherited the lands of Deane, which remained in the family for many generations.Burke, John (1838, London) Burke's Landed Gentry (1863) 'Tyndale of Haling'Nichols, JohnLiterary Anecdotes (18th century), Vol IX: 'Genealogy of the Family of Tindal of Northumberland, Devon & Essex' The Deane arms have been quartered with those of Tyndall ever since and were adopted as the only arms of the Tindal branch of the family from the 17th century (and can be seen, below, under the portrait of Rev Nicolas Tindal).Rapin de Thomas, Paul (trans by Nicolas Tindal) History of England: Portrait of Rev Nicolas Tindal in frontispiece of one volume, with arms of Deane and ancient crest of Tyndall =The Tyndalls at court= Subsequent Tyndalls married well, inheriting the estates of Hockwald in Norfolk and Mapplestead Magna in Essex in marriages with heiresses of the de Montford and Fermor families. Several heads of the family were knighted and many appear to have been prominent at court. A William Tyndall was Lancaster Herald under King Edward IV. Sir William Tyndall of Hockwald and Deane was created Knight Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath on 29 November 1489, on the creation of Prince Arthur as Prince of Wales in the reign of Henry VII. He was a Herald of the King, first as Guisne Pursuivant and later as Rouge Dragon.Nichols genealogy His son, Sir Thomas Tyndall, was admitted to the Order of the Bath following the coronation of Queen Anne Boleyn. Through marriage to the Felstead family, he became co-heir to the Barony of Scales, the daughter of the last Baron Scales having died without issue. He shared this distinction with the then Earl of Oxford.Proceedings before the House of Lords Privileges Committee (1850s) relating to a claim for the Barony of Scales =The Tyndall Family and the Throne of Bohemia= When King Richard II married Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, she brought with her cousin, Princess Margaret of Teschen, daughter of Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Teschen in modern Silesia by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Boles≈Çaw, Duke of Ko≈∫le and Bytom. This lady married Sir Simon Bigod de Felbrigg in Essex, the standard bearer of Richard II and their daughter, Alana, married Sir William Tyndall of Deene. It has already been related that, through the Felbriggs, the Tyndalls came to be co-heirs to the Barony of Scales with the Earls of Oxford. However, a more regal dignity descended through Margaret of Teschen when the House of Luxemburg died out with the death of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia (1368‚Äì1437) and Sir William Tyndall became one of the heirs to the elective throne of Bohemia. John Nichols relates that a delegation of Bohemian boyars were sent to England to offer him the throne but that he refused, the Habsburgs succeeding to a throne they held (with one interruption) until 1918. William Tyndale There was an oral tradition at the University of Cambridge that Humphrey Tyndall, brother of Sir John Tyndall of Mapplestead and uncle (or great uncle) of the eminent deist Dr Matthew Tindal, was again offered the throne by the Protestant party in Bohemia in 1620. This Humphrey was Dean of Ely and President of Queens' College, Cambridge and Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University.History and Antiquities of the Cathedral Church of Ely, p 229Website of Queens' College, Cambridge Humphrey refused, saying that \\"he had rather be Queen Elizabeth's subject than a foreign Prince\\",Quote taken from the brass plaque adjacent to Humphrey Tyndale's gravestone at Ely Cathedral leading to the ill-fated Frederick V, Elector Palatine (married to Elizabeth, daughter of James I and ancestor of the present Queen) becoming King for a year ‚Äì a development that was a principal cause of the thirty years war.However,Humphrey Tyndall died in 1614. =William Tyndale= The most eminent member of the family, William Tyndale (c. 1494 ‚Äì 1536), was the first translator of the Bible into modern English. His great work was also one of the first vernacular Bibles to be derived from the primary Hebrew and Greek texts. Its effect on the English church was electrifying, leading to thousands of Bibles being smuggled into England; Tyndale's individual contribution to the linguistic development of the modern English language perhaps ranks as second only to that of Shakespeare. Aside from his life work, Tyndale was a prodigious pamphleteer, propounding a Protestant agenda that was significantly more radical than that of his protector, Martin Luther. His radicalism, prodigious output and written battles with Thomas More eventually led to his capture near Antwerp, after which he was burnt at the stake as a heretic. He is regarded as a martyr in the Church of England and his death is commemorated in the Book of Common Prayer. Born in Gloucestershire, William Tyndale is known to have been the brother of Edward Tyndale of Pull Court, Gloucestershire, receiver to the lands of Lord Berkeley based on the 1533 letter of Bishop Stokesley of London. However, all that can be surmised from data available is that William was related to Richard Tyndale and Tabitha Hitchins of Melksham Court and had brothers John and Edward, the Receiver of Berkley, but most certainly was NOT of the line of Tyndale of Hockwold. (Although Edward Tyndale is recorded in two genealogies as having been the 'brother of Sir William de Tyndall of Deane and Hockwold' but that William died after 1542 so they were in error on the relationship with that William (but suggesting that he was connected to this branch of the family somehow),Nichols, John Literary Anecdotes, Vol XI (18th century)Burke's Landed Gentry (19th century editions) \\"Tyndale of Haling\\" that myth was broken and the suggestion dismissed in \\"The Memoirs of the extinct family of Chesters of Chicheley\\" as well as in The Genealogy of the Family of Tyndale (by B. W. Greenfield, 1843) and The Biography of William Tyndale.)William Tindale bio by Demaus p22-23 =Ralph Dundas Tindal, a Napoleonic and later Dutch Baron= General Ralph Dundas Tindal was born in Deventer on 24 February 1773,The Nobilities of Europe, by the Marquis de Ruvigny, published by Melville and Company, London, 1910 (page 412). of Scottish origin. He died at Zeist on 4 August 1834. He served in the Netherlands military, and in French service. His father had emigrated to Holland and had also served in Dutch service. Whilst in French imperial service, Ralph Dundas Tindal was created Baron de Tindal on 12 April 1813 by the French Emperor Napoleon (Bonaparte). Later he joined Dutch forces and became lieutenant-general in the infantry, and on 8 July 1815, King William I of the Netherlands bestowed a knightly order on him, the Willems-Orde. On 16 September 1815 he was raised in the Dutch nobility, again with the title baron. The Tindal/Tindal-Carill-Worsley family =Derivation= The senior branch of the English Tyndall family, last seated at Mapplestead Magna in the 17th century, died out in the direct male line in the 17th century and in the female line over a hundred years later. The senior English branch is thus the Tindal (now Tindal-Carill-Worsley) family, whose history is related in the 1973 volume of Burke's Landed Gentry. This family derived from Rev John Tindal, Rector of Bere Ferris, Devon, in the mid-17th century, said (in the Nichols genealogy) to have been the younger son of Sir John Tyndall of Mapplestead, the brother of Dean Humphrey Tyndall, President of Queens' College, Cambridge. There is, however, support for the contention that Rev. John was the son of Sir John's elder son Dean.The Visitation of Essex of around 1632 records Deane Tyndall as having, amongst other issue, Francis and John. Francis is recorded in the Nichols genealogy and in depositions submitted at the time of a claim to the Barony of Scales in the 19th century as having had daughters whose line died out three generations later. Further support comes from the dates. Rev John married in 1655 yet Francis was born as early as 1614. It is far more likely that Francis was John's brother than his nephew. Rev John's migration to Devon (after his studies for Holy Orders) was typical of the many migrations of the Tyndall/Tyndale/Tindal/Tindell family since the late 15th century. The use of 'Tindal' represents a more Latinised usage which was common amongst many literary figures in this era and there is evidence that it was first used by his sons, Matthew (1657‚Äì1733), Thomas (1658‚Äì1714) and Richard (1659‚Äì1697). Matthew had been described as 'Tyndall' when at Oxford University in 1688;By Anthony Wood in a reference to Tindal/Tyndall taking Anglican communion on 16 June 1688: 'The Life and Times of Anthony Wood', p 264, cited in Lalor, Stephen (Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., 2006) Matthew Tindal, Freethinker: An Eighteenth-century Assault on Religion, two of his brothers, Thomas and Richard, emigrated to Fenwick's Colony in 1674 and his other brother, John, was the father of Rev Nicolas Tindal (see below). .The arms of Rev John and his successors, a fesse dancette gules below three crescents of the last, are the arms of the family of Deane; though his crest, a plume of five ostrich feathers charged with an ermine spot out of a ducal coronet of five oak leaves, is that of the Tyndales of Deane, Hockwald and Mapplestead. The main branch were the heirs general of the Deane family, having inherited Deane in the 13th century, and quartered their arms directly after the Tyndall arms. The adoption of their arms, together with the Tyndall crest, provides strong further evidence of Rev John's descent (in addition to the genealogies in Nichols and the Visitation), notwithstanding the possible inaccuracy of the former (regarding Rev John' brother or father Deane Tyndall). Rev John Tindal married Ann Hals, who was descended from the Fortescue and Clifford families and was the first cousin of Thomas, Lord Clifford, Lord High Treasurer of England to Charles II. Through this connection and those of Diana Pocklington, the wife of Capt George Tindal, RN, Lord Chief Justice Tindal (see below) was descended from Lords Chief Justices Sir William Yelverton and Sir John Fortescue and from Sir Roger Manwood, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer.Burke's Landed Gentry (1863): 'Tindal of Chelmsford'. =Philosopher, historian and judge= Rev Nicolas Tindal. The Tindal arms shown are those of Deane, whom the Tindal/Tyndale family represent, together with the ancient crest of Tyndall Dr Matthew Tindal (1657‚Äì1733), a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, where he lived for most of his life, was an important figure in the early English Enlightenment. Born during the Commonwealth to the above-mentioned Rev John Tindal, he appears to have been an opportunist in his youth, turning to Rome under James II. However, he later wrote the foundation of English deist thought, Christianity as Old as the Creation, later known as the \\"Deist's Bible\\". This seminal tract, which had enduring influence on German deism in particular, represented that no true religion could rely on any doctrines that could not be divined through human reason. Thus, Christianity, if a true religion, has no need of revelation to support its dogmas and must be as old as the Creation. His writings provoked scandal and his book was burned by the public hangman, in addition to provoking a number of replies.Lalor, ibidOxford Dictionary of National Biography (DNB) (Oxford, 2004) Statue of Sir Nicolas Tindal Dr Tindal's nephew, Rev Nicolas Tindal (1687‚Äì1774), was the translator and continuer of the History of England by Paul de Rapin. Very few comprehensive histories existed at the time and Tindal wrote a three volume \\"Continuation\\", a history of the Kingdom from the reign of James II to that of George II. Something of a controversialist, he was also known for having been defrauded of his uncle's inheritance by Eustace Brugnell, leading to some lines of Alexander Pope. Rector of two livings, Chaplain of Greenwich Hospital and a Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford,ibid Tindal was sufficiently prosporous to allow his son, Capt George Tindal RN to settle in Coval Hall, Chelmsford.Monument to Capt George Tindal in Chelmsford Cathedral. Capt George Tindal's grandson, Rev William Tindal (1756‚Äì1804), was a Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford and chaplain of the Tower of London. An antiquarian, he published a history of Evesham Abbey.DNB (2004) Another of George's grandsons, Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal (1776‚Äì1846), was Lord Chief Justice from 1829 to 1845. His career first came to public notice when he acted for Queen Caroline in the famous attempt of George IV to divorce her in the House of Lords. Shortly afterwards, he was elected to Parliament, serving as Solicitor General for five years. Whilst Lord Chief Justice, he sat in the famous case of Daniel M'Naghten, who had attempted to assassinate Robert Peel, and derived from the common law the defence of insanity.The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol.XXVI (1846) p.199 Louis Symonds Tindal as a midshipman. Sir Nicolas's second son, Vice Admiral Louis Symonds Tindal (1810‚Äì1876), joined the Royal Navy as a boy, in 1825 and had an adventurous, wide-ranging and distinguished career. Promoted lieutenant in 1832, by 1836 he was in the sloop 'Vestal' on the North American station and later the sloop 'Calliope' on the South American station. In 1841 he was in China, where he was present at the Battle of Chuenpi, the storming of Wampea reach and at attacks on Canton. In recognition of his role in these raids, he was promoted commander that year and given command of the sloop 'Pylades', which he brought home from the east in 1843. In 1846 he commanded the brig- sloop 'Grecian' to open the South American station, returning in 1849. He was promoted captain in 1852, rear-admiral in 1868 and vice-admiral in 1874. =Australian Tindals= Sir Nicolas's youngest brother, Charles, a commander in the Royal Navy, became Governor of the Bank of England in the west of England. His son, Charles Grant Tindal (1823‚Äì1914) was a successful cattle breeder, meat processor and landowner. Having started his career on explorations of New South Wales, he leased a cattle station before buying the Ramornie station on the Orana River, near Grafton in NSW. In addition to cattle breeding, he was a highly successful breeder of racehorses, both in Australia and England, where he retained his father's property of Fir Grove, Hampshire. At its peak, Charles's meat processing company slaughtered 35,000 beasts a year and was well established on the English market. Charles's descendants remain in Australia to this day (although several Australian Tyndalls descend from the Irish branch of the family). One, Wing Cdr Archibald Tindal, who was killed during the bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942, became the first RAAF airman to be killed on the Australian mainland during World War II. After the war, Carson's Airfield, located approximately south- east from Darwin, was renamed RAAF Base Tindal in his honour. =The modern era= Nicolas Tindal-Carill-Worsley Sir Nicolas ultimately left no descendants in the male line, though a branch of the Bosanquet family are his descendants and Reginald Bosanquet, the broadcaster for ITN, was his great great grandson. Members of the main branch of the English family descend from his brother, Thomas Tindal of Aylesbury, Clerk of the Peace for Buckinghamshire. He married Anne, the daughter of Acton Chaplin, Clerk of the Peace for Buckinghamshire.

F.3.23, F.3.27, F.4.18 in Trinity College Library, Dublin The family originated in Gloucestershire and were closely related to William Tyndale, the Bible translator. Another William Tyndall is mentioned in the 1659 census as living in Duganstowne, Catherlagh (County Carlow), co-owned by him and a Richard Andrewes as tituladoes. Similarly, a John Tyndall came from Gloucestershire to Ireland during the Wars of Rebellion and had a grant of land confirmed to him in 1668. He married Isabelle de Rinzy of County Wexford. Amongst the landed gentry in Ireland in the 19th century, Tyndalls appeared established with estates and seats at Ballyanne House, and Berkeley Forest, both in New Ross, County Wexford, and Prospect Hall, County Kilkenny, as well as in County Carlow, and Kildevin, County Westmeath, and Dublin City. Samuel Tyndall served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1826 to 1827. E.L. Tyndall was a Knight Grand Cordon, 6th Class, of the Order of the Sacred Treasure of Japan (founded by the Emperor Meiji (Mutsuhito) on 8 January 1888)Source: The Nobilities of Europe, edited by the Marquis de Ruvigny, published by Melville and Company, London, 1909. Page 296. =Prominent Irish Tyndalls= John Tyndall John Tyndall (1820‚Äì1893) from Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Ireland, a staunch Protestant Unionist, was a well-known physicist from Ireland, who discovered the Tyndall effect.Brock, WH, and Mollan, RC (ed) (Royal Dublin Society 1981) John Tyndall ‚Äì Essays on a Natural Philosopher.Dublin Almanacks, 1830, 1840, & 1860. A relative, another John Tyndall of Newcastle ran a forge, coachmaking and saddlery, in the middle of the 19th century, and his grandson, David P. Tyndall (1890‚Äì1970), from Chapelizod, became a prominent Irish businessman in the 20th century, who founded the firm D. Tyndall & Sons, as well as several other companies, and consolidated and modernised the wholesale trade sector, introducing the SPAR chain into Ireland. John Hutchyns Tyndall (1934‚Äì2005) born Exeter, Devon, England, was a British politician who was involved in a number of nationalist movements in post-war Britain, best known for leading the National Front in the 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. His paternal family were Protestant Unionists from County Waterford, his ancestors having settled in Ireland in the 16th century. His grandfather had been a district inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary. Other lines of the Irish branch of the family have spread to Australia and the USA. Tyndall-named institutions and places * England: The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research has locations in the University of East Anglia in Norwich, the University of Manchester, the University of Southampton, the University of Sussex in Brighton, Oxford University, and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. 'Tindal Square' in Chelmsford is named after Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal. 'Tindal Hospital', Aylesbury, is named after the family of Thomas and Acton Tindal, Lords of the Manor of Aylesbury. A branch of the Tyndall family settled in Bristol, and created Tyndalls Park in the 18th century; they built Royal Fort House, now part of the campus of the University of Bristol: there is a Tyndall lecture theatre and, nearby, a road named Tyndall Avenue. * Republic of Ireland: In honour of physicist John Tyndall, the Tyndall National Institute was created in Ireland in 2004 at the initiative of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and University College Cork (UCC) to bring together complementary activities in photonics, electronics and networking research at the National Microelectronics Research Centre (NMRC), several UCC academic departments and Cork Institute of Technology (CIT). * New Zealand: The Tyndall name has lent itself to an important investment fund management enterprise. * USA: Tyndall Air Force Base, named for World War I flying ace Lt. Frank B. Tyndall, is located in Bay County, Florida. The small city of Tyndall, South Dakota, named for John Tyndall, is the county seat of Bon Homme County. Tyndall Glacier in Colorado is also named after John Tyndall. * Australia: Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal, in the Northern Territory is named after Wing Cmdr Archibald Tindal, the first Australian airman to be killed on the Australian mainland in World War II (see above under Tindal/Tindal-Carill-Worsley family). * Canada: The town of Tyndall, Manitoba. Tyndall stone is the name of a limestone often used in construction and decoration in Manitoba. * A crater on Mars is named after John Tyndall. In The United States Richard Tindall continued as surveyor- general of Fenwick's Colony following the sale of the Salem Tenth to William Penn in 1682. Quit Rents and Warrants, History and Genealogy of Fenwick's Colony, page 496. His brother Thomas Tindall was the first purchaser of land in Hopewell, New Jersey and had many children.Ege, Ralph Pioneers of Old Hopewell (1908), Race & Savidge, Hopewell, New Jersey, pg 13-14. \\"This Houghton tract was surveyed by Thomas Revell, agent for the West Jersey Society, for Thomas Tindall, on February 27, 1696, and was without doubt the first farm located in the Hopewell Valley. On November 10, 1699, a deed was given by Thomas Revell, agent for 'Ye Honorable The West Jersey Society in England' of the one part, and Thomas Tindall of the other part, for the above tract, the consideration being 'ten pounds per hundred acres,' or fifty cents per acre in US currency, which was the regulation price for all the societies lands of the 30,000 acre tract. The above deed describes the as a part of the 30,000 acre tract 'lying above ye fialls of ye Delaware.'\\" * Tindall, Missouri is named for Union Army Colonel Jacob T. Tindall. First Lieutenant (Air Service) Frank Benjamin Tyndall, United States Army Air Service flew as an Ace Fighter Pilot with 22d Aero Squadron. By direction of the President, under the provisions of the act of Congress approved 9 July 1918 (Bul. No. 43, W.D., 1918), LT. Frank B. Tyndall is cited by the Commanding General, American Expeditionary Forces, for gallantry in action and a Silver Star may be placed upon the ribbon of the Victory Medals awarded him. First Lieutenant Tyndall distinguished himself by gallantry in action while serving with the 22d Aero Squadron, American Expeditionary Forces, in action near Conflans, France, 29 October 1918, in pursuing an enemy Fokker far within the enemy's lines and bringing it down. After the war was over he worked with Boeing on loan from the government as a consultant and test pilot. During one of his test flights his plane had a mechanical failure and he had to bail out. As a result, he was the second Airman to successfully survive using a parachute. He died 15 July 1930 after the plane he was flying crashed. Ten years later Tyndall Air Force Base was named in his honour. He was survived by his wife Grace Tyndall and his daughter Mary Tyndall.

The 16-day mission marked the last flight of the European Space Agency's Spacelab laboratory module, which had first flown on Columbia on STS-9, and was also the last daytime landing for Columbia. Crew =Backup crew= Mission highlights Neurolab was a Spacelab module mission focusing on the effects of microgravity on the nervous system. The goals of Neurolab were to study basic research questions and to increase the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for neurological and behavioral changes in space. Specifically, experiments would study the adaptation of the vestibular system and space adaptation syndrome, the adaptation of the central nervous system and the pathways which control the ability to sense location in the absence of gravity, and the effect of microgravity on a developing nervous system. The science lead was Mary Anne Frey. The mission was a joint venture of six space agencies and seven U.S. research agencies. Investigator teams from nine countries would conduct 31 studies in the microgravity environment of space. Other agencies participating in the mission included six institutes of the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research, as well as the space agencies of Canada, France, Germany, and Japan, and the European Space Agency. Neurolab's 26 experiments targeted one of the most complex and least understood parts of the human body ‚Äì the nervous system. Primary goals were to conduct basic research in neurosciences and expand understanding of how the nervous system develops and functions in space. Test subjects were rats, mice, crickets, snails, two kinds of fish and the crew members themselves. Cooperative effort of NASA, several domestic partners and the space agencies of Canada (CSA), France (CNES) and Germany (DLR), as well as the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). Most experiments conducted in pressurized Spacelab long module located in Columbia's payload bay. This was the 16th and last scheduled flight of the ESA-developed Spacelab module although Spacelab pallets would continue to be used on the International Space Station. Research conducted as planned, with the exception of the Mammalian Development Team, which had to reprioritize science activities because of the unexpected high mortality rate of neonatal rats on board. Other payloads included the Shuttle Vibration Forces experiment, the Bioreactor Demonstration System-04, and three Get-Away Special (GAS) canister investigations. STS-90 was the first mission to make an Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) assist burn during the ascent. Three of the seven STS-90 crew (Williams, Pawelczyk and Buckey) appeared on the Canadian television series Popular Mechanics for Kids. Working with engineers on the ground a week into the flight, the on-orbit crew used aluminum tape to bypass a suspect valve in the Regenerative Carbon Dioxide Removal System that had threatened to cut short the mission. Mission Management Team considered, but decided against, extending the mission one day because the science community indicated an extended flight was not necessary and weather conditions were expected to deteriorate after planned landing on Sunday, 3 May. STS-90 Mission Specialist Kathryn Hire was Kennedy Space Center's first employee to be chosen as an astronaut candidate. STS-90 was the first shuttle flight known to carry a bat on the solid booster. A bat suffered a similar fate during STS-119.

It was flown by Space Shuttle Discovery, and launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 2 June 1998. Crew Mission highlights STS-91 marked the final Shuttle/Mir Docking Mission, as well as the only such docking for Discovery. This Phase 1 Program was a precursor to the International Space Station maintaining a continuous American presence in space and developing the procedures and hardware required for an international partnership in space. The mission was the first to use the super lightweight external tank (SLWT) which was the same size, at long and in diameter, as the external tank used on previous launches, but lighter. The tank was made of an aluminium lithium alloy and the tank's structural design had also been improved making it 30 percent stronger and 5 percent less dense. The walls of the redesigned hydrogen tank were machined in an orthogonal waffle-like pattern, providing more strength and stability than the previous design. These improvements would later provide additional payload capacity to the International Space Station. Docking of Discovery to Mir, the first for that orbiter, occurred at 16:01 UTC, 4 June 1998 at an altitude of 208 miles. Hatches opened at 2:34 pm the same day. At hatch opening, Andy Thomas officially became a member of Discovery's crew, completing 130 days of living and working on Mir. The transfer wrapped up a total of 907 days spent by seven U.S. astronauts aboard the Russian space station as long-duration crew members. During the next four days, the Mir 25 and STS-91 crews transferred more than of water, and almost of cargo experiments and supplies were exchanged between the two spacecraft. During this time, long-term U.S. experiments aboard the Mir were moved into Discoverys middeck locker area and the SPACEHAB single module in the orbiter's payload bay, including the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) and the tissue engineering co-culture (COCULT) investigations, as well as two crystal growth experiments. The crews also conducted Risk Mitigation Experiments (RMEs) and Human Life Sciences (HLS) investigations. When the hatches closed for undocking at 9:07 am, 8 June, and the spacecraft separated at 12:01 pm that day, the final Shuttle-Mir docking mission was concluded and Phase 1 of the International Space Station (ISS) program came to an end. Mir as seen from Discovery after undocking STS-91 also carried a prototype of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) into space. The AMS, designed to look for dark and missing matter in the universe, was powered up on Flight Day 1. Data originally planned to be sent to ground stations through Discovery's Ku-band communications system was recorded on board because of a problem with the Ku- band system that prevented it from sending high-rate communications, including television signals, to the ground. The system was able to receive uplink transmissions. On 3 June 1998 the crew was able to set up a bypass system that allowed AMS data to be downlinked via S-band/FM communications when the orbiter came within range of a ground station. Data that could not be recorded by ground stations was recorded on board throughout the mission. The Ku-band system failure was determined to be located in a component that was not accessible to the crew. The failure prevented television transmission throughout the mission. Television broadcasts from Mir were prevented by a problem between a Russian ground station and the mission control center outside Moscow, limiting communications to audio only on NASA television. Other experiments conducted by the Shuttle crew during the mission included a checkout of the orbiter's robot arm to evaluate new electronics and software and the Orbiter Space Vision System for use during assembly missions for the ISS. Also on board in the payload bay were eight Get Away Special experiments, while combustion, crystal growth and radiation monitoring experiments were conducted in Discovery's mid-deck crew cabin area.

Illustration of the International Space Station during STS-106. Crewmembers pose for the inflight crew portrait. The International Space Station as seen from STS-106. In view are the station's Unity, Zarya, and Zvezda modules, in addition to a docked Progress spacecraft. Space Station assembly flight ISS-2A.2b utilized the SPACEHAB Double Module and the Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC) to bring supplies to the station. The mission also included one spacewalk. Veteran Astronaut Terrence Wilcutt (Col., USMC) led the seven-man crew, commanding his second Shuttle flight and making his fourth trip into space. During the planned 11-day mission, Wilcutt and his crew mates spent a week inside the ISS unloading supplies from both a double SPACEHAB cargo module in the rear of Atlantis's cargo bay and from a Russian Progress M-1 resupply craft docked to the aft end of the Zvezda Service Module. Zvezda, which linked up to the ISS on 26 July, served as the early living quarters for the station and is the cornerstone of the Russian contribution to the ISS. Mission STS-106 was added to the manifest after delays in launching Zvezda. The STS-101 flight was originally planned to carry cargo to the ISS and have three crew perform an EVA to connect Zvezda to the ISS, but the delays caused the mission objectives of STS-101 to be split into 2A.2a (STS-101) and 2A.2b (STS-106). The three spacewalk crewmembers Lu, Williams, and Malenchenko followed their EVA onto STS-106. The goal of the flight was to prepare Zvezda for the arrival of the first residents, or Expedition, crew later in the fall of 2000 and the start of a permanent human presence on the new outpost. That crew, made up of Expedition Commander Bill Shepherd, Soyuz Commander Yuri Gidzenko and Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev, launched on 31 October 2000 in a Soyuz capsule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for a four-month \\"shakedown\\" mission aboard the ISS. On flight day three, Dr. Ed Lu and Yuri Malenchenko (Col., Russian Air Force), who were both making their second flights into space, conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk. The spacewalk's objective focused on routing and connecting nine power, data and communications cables between the Zvezda module and the other Russian-built module, Zarya, as well as installing the six-foot-long magnetometer. The magnetometer would serve as a three-dimensional compass designed to minimize Zvezda propellant usage by relaying information to the module's computers regarding its orientation relative to the Earth. Lu and Malenchenko used tethers and handrails along the ISS to make their way to a point more than 100 feet above the cargo bay, the farthest any tethered spacewalker has ventured outside the shuttle. They completed this with the assistance of their crewmates Burbank and Mastracchio who deftly maneuvered them around with the robotic arm. This spacewalk celebrates the sixth spacewalk in support of the station assembly and the 50th spacewalk in Space Shuttle history. Also this was the second joint U.S.-Russian space walk outside a Space Shuttle, following on the work conducted by Astronaut Scott Parazynski and Cosmonaut Vladimir Titov outside Atlantis while docked to the Mir Space Station during the STS-86 mission in October 1997. Lu, designated EV 1, wore the space suit marked by red stripes, while Malenchenko, EV 2, wore the pure white suit. This was Lu's first space walk, while Malenchenko had conducted a pair of space walks totaling 12 hours during his four-month stay aboard Mir in 1994. Dan Burbank (Lt. Cmdr, USCG), who was a spaceflight rookie, served as the space walk choreographer. Mission Specialist Rick Mastracchio, also a spaceflight novice, was the prime robot arm operator for the mission, using the Canadian-built arm to move Lu and Malenchenko around the ISS as they conducted their assembly work. Mastracchio is backed up on arm operations by Pilot Scott Altman (Cmdr., USN), making his second flight into space. The final member of the crew was Russian Cosmonaut Dr. Boris Morukov, making his first flight into space. Morukov was responsible for unloading supplies from the Progress vehicle during the docked phase of the flight. On flight day four the crew entered the International Space Station through Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA-2) to begin the transfer operations of more than three tons of hardware and supplies. Atlantis' crew was the first to see the interior of the Russian Zvezda service module since it was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in July. Additionally, a reboost was performed using the orbiter's Reaction Control System (RCS) to place the station in a higher orbit. Transfer of supplies and maintenance tasks continued well into the fifth day, while orbiter consumables remained above the required levels allowing managers to extend the mission one additional day. Activities on flight day five included the installation of three batteries inside Zvezda. In order to reduce the weight for launch, Zvezda was launched with only five of its eight batteries in place. Lu and Malenchenko spent much of flight day seven installing voltage and current stabilizers in Zvezda. Components of the Elektron system, equipment sent into orbit to separate water into oxygen and hydrogen, were installed and would be activated after the first crew arrives. The crew transferred more than 6,000 pounds of material ‚Äì including six 100-pound bags of water, all of the food for the first resident crew, office supplies, onboard environmental supplies, a vacuum cleaner and a computer and monitor ‚Äì to the interior of the station. The astronauts spent a total of 5 days, 9 hours and 21 minutes inside the station before closing the hatch on the orbiting outpost. Wilcutt and Altman commanded a series of four altitude boosts to place the station in an orbit of approximately 241 by 233 statute miles, raising the average altitude by . After spending 7 days, 21 hours and 54 minutes linked to the station, Atlantis undocked at 11:46 pm EDT as Wilcutt and Altman fired Atlantis' jets to move to a distance of about 450 feet for a double-loop flyaround. Commander Terry Wilcutt guided Atlantis to a landing at 2:56 am Central time, wrapping up a 4.9 million mile mission in which more than three tons of equipment were delivered to the international outpost. Wilcutt and his crewmates, Pilot Scott Altman and Mission Specialists Ed Lu, Rick Mastracchio, Dan Burbank, Yuri Malenchenko and Boris Morukov completed the 23rd consecutive landing of a shuttle at the Florida spaceport, and the 30th landing of a Shuttle at the Cape in the last 31 flights. The first initial amateur radio station was flown on board the Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-106. The crew transferred the ham radio gear into the space station for future use by the Expedition One crew.

Illustration of the ISS after STS-92. STS-92 was an ISS assembly flight that brought the Z1 truss, Control Moment Gyros, Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 (PMA-3) (mounted on a Spacelab pallet) and two DDCU (Heat pipes) to the space station. The Z1 truss was the first exterior framework installed on the ISS and allowed the first U.S. solar arrays to be temporarily installed on Unity for early power during flight 4A. The Ku-band communication system supported early science capabilities and U.S. television on flight 6A. The CMGs (Control Moment Gyros) weigh about and provide non-propulsive (electrically powered) attitude control when activated on flight 5A, and PMA-3 provides shuttle docking port for solar array installation on flight 4A and Destiny Lab installation on flight 5A. The mission included seven days of docked operations with the space station, four EVAs, and two ingress opportunities. Over the course of four scheduled spacewalks, two teams of space walkers and an experienced robot arm operator collaborated to install the Z1 (Z for zenith port) truss structure on top of the U.S. Unity connecting node on the growing station and to deliver the third Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA 3) to the ISS for the future berthing of new station components and to accommodate shuttle dockings. The Z1 truss was the first permanent lattice-work structure for the ISS, very much like a girder, setting the stage for the future addition of the station's major trusses or backbones. The Z1 fixture also served as the platform on which the huge U.S. solar arrays were mounted on the next shuttle assembly flight, STS-97. The Z1 truss included many elements of the Communications and Tracking subsystem. The hardware included a Transmitter/Receiver/Controller (SGTRC) built by L3 Communications Systems-East in Camden, NJ. John Schina was the Chief Engineer of the ISS Program at L3. The Z1 contains four large gyroscopic devices, called Control Moment Gyroscope (CMGs), which are used to maneuver the space station into the proper orientation on orbit once they were activated following the installation of the U.S. laboratory. During the fourth spacewalk, astronauts Wisoff and L√≥pez-Alegr√≠a tested the SAFER jet backpack, flying up to 50 feet while remaining tethered to the spacecraft.STS-92 NASA Mission Report #15 NASA, 18 October 2008.

Biography  He was born at Esslingen, W√ºrttemberg, the son of Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Hochstetter (1787-1860), a clergyman and professor at Bonn, who was also a botanist and mineralogist. Having received his early education at the evangelical seminary at Maulbronn, Ferdinand proceeded to the University of T√ºbingen and the T√ºbinger Stift; there, under Friedrich August von Quenstedt, the interest he already felt in geology became permanently fixed, and he obtained his doctor's degree and a travelling scholarship. In 1852 he joined the staff of the Imperial Geological Survey of Austria and was engaged until 1856 in parts of Bohemia, especially in the Bohemian Forest, and in the Fichtel Hills and Karlsbad mountains. His excellent reports established his reputation. Thus he came to be chosen as geologist to the Novara expedition (1857‚Äì59), and made numerous valuable observations in the voyage round the world. In 1859 he was employed by the government of New Zealand to make a first geological survey of the islands. His survey of old Lake Rotomahana and the Pink and White Terraces provides the only primary evidence of the Terrace locations today. Between 2016 and 2020, his survey diary was reverse engineered to provide the coordinates of the Pink, Black and White Terraces. Bunn, A. R., Davies, N. and Stewart, D.

In 1872 he became the natural history tutor of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria. In 1876 he was made superintendent of the Imperial Natural History Museum. In these later years he explored portions of Turkey and eastern Russia, and he published papers on a variety of geological, palaeontological and mineralogical subjects. He died in Oberd√∂bling near Vienna, at age 55. Detailed descriptions in his diaries were helpful in 2011, when researchers managed to locate the silica terraces on Lake Rotomahana, which was buried in the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Discovery of silica terraces that was damaged by volcanic eruption Legacy =Taxonomy= New Zealand's endemic Hochstetter's frog, Leiopelma hochstetteri, is named after Ferdinand.

Friedrich August von Quenstedt (July 10, 1809 - December 21, 1889), was a German geologist and palaeontologist. Life Von Quenstedt was born at Eisleben in Saxony, and educated at the Humboldt University of Berlin. After a period as assistant in the mineralogical museum, he was appointed associate professor (1837) and then professor (1841) of mineralogy and geognosy at the Eberhard Karls Universit√§t T√ºbingen. Work His earlier work related chiefly to crystallography and mineralogy, on which subjects he published text-books that were widely used. However, he also became distinguished for his researches on palaeontology, and especially for those on the fossils of the Jurassic system. In 1845, he devised a trinomial system of nomenclature for Jurassic ammonites, which has caused some difficulty for later taxonomists.J.H. Callomon, D. T. Donovan, & M. K. Howarth \\"F. A. Quenstedt's Trinominal Nomenclature of Jurassic Ammonites\\" Palaeontology 47 (4) 1063 (2004) He investigated series of ammonite fossils which appeared to represent the coiled and uncoiled forms of similar shells, and considered that they arose as 'pathological' forms. He also wrote several articles on pterodactyls. Five genera were named in his honour: the bivalve mollusc genus Quenstedtia Morris & Lycett 1854 and the (homonymous) coelenterate genus Quenstedtia Rominger 1876, coelenterate genus Quenstedtiphyllia Melnikova 1975, ammonite genus Quenstedtoceras Hyatt, 1876, and crinoid genus Quenstedticrinus Klikushin 1987. Also the specific epithet of Proganochelys quenstedti was named after him. The mineral quenstedtite was named in his honour by G. Linck in 1888. When Maria von Linden wrote her first paper on the mineral deposits in the River H√ºrbe it was read at Karlsruhe's geological society (by a man) in 1890. The paper was noticed by Quenstedt who supported her ambitions. Linden went on to be the first woman in Germany to be called a professor.Maria von Linden, Rheinische-Geschichte.lvr.de, Retrieved 9 November 2015 Chief publications Plate 102 from Die Ammoniten des Schw√§bischen Jura (1883-85) by Friedrich August von Quenstedt.

Its primary objective was to deliver supplies to and help maintain the ISS. STS-108 was the 12th shuttle flight to visit the International Space Station and the first since the installation of the Russian airlock called Pirs on the station. Endeavour delivered the Expedition 4 crew to the orbital outpost. The Expedition 3 crew returned to Earth on Endeavour.HSF ‚Äì STS-108 Shuttle Archives While at the station, the crew conducted one spacewalk and attached the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module to the station so that about 2.7 metric tons (3 tons) of equipment and supplies could be unloaded. The crew later returned Raffaello to Endeavour's payload bay for the trip home. Crew Cargo MACH-1 Carrier LMC with 3x GAS and SEM STS-108 SSAF-UF-1 carried the Multi Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM-2) 'Raffaello' (2nd flight) 4th MPLM flight overall. Also the Multiple Application Customized Hitchhiker (MACH-1) MPESS Hitchhiker experiment bridge: with CAPL-3, Starshine-2, SEM-11 & 15, G-0761, Prototype Synchrotron Radiation Detector (PSRD) & COLLIDE-2. As well as the Lightweight MPESS Carrier #2 (LMC) carrying: SEM-12, G-0785, G-0064 and G-0730. Launch highlights The launch of Endeavour on 29 November 2001 was rescheduled for 4 December 2001 to allow sufficient time for the Expedition Three crew on the space station to successfully complete a spacewalk to clear an obstruction on the latching mechanism on the Russian Progress supply vehicle. The launch 4 December was postponed due to unsatisfactory weather conditions in the KSC area. Launch controllers counted down to the T-5-minute point and held until the remainder of the window expired. The scrub had to be called after Astronaut Office Chief Charles Precourt, flying the Shuttle Training Aircraft, detected precipitation in a cloud mass that moved into the Complex 39 area shortly before launch. Endeavour lifted off 5 December 2001 at 17:12 EST on the final Space Shuttle mission of 2001 to deliver three tons of supplies and a fresh crew to the International Space Station, and return home a crew that spent four months in space. In addition to a new station crew and supplies, Endeavour carried a host of scientific investigations, including experiments from space agencies, schools and universities across the United States, Europe and South America, as well as a small satellite that involved more than 25,000 students in 26 countries.NASA ‚Äì STS-108 Mission highlights The hatches were opened between Endeavour and the ISS Destiny Laboratory at 22:42 UTC 7 December 2001, enabling the ten crew members to greet one another. The Expedition 3 crew officially ended their 117-day residency on board the International Space Station 8 Dec. as their custom Soyuz seat-liners were transferred to Endeavour for the return trip home. The transfer of the Expedition 4 seat-liners to the Soyuz return vehicle attached to the station marked the official exchange of crews. Endeavour Pilot Mark Kelly and Mission Specialist Linda Godwin used the shuttle's robotic arm to lift the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station's Unity node. The crews began unloading supplies the same day. =EVA= EVA: 4 hours, 12 minutes ‚Äì On 10 December 2001, Endeavour astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani completed a four-hour, 12-minute spacewalk to install insulation on mechanisms that rotate the International Space Station's main solar arrays. The two spacewalkers stopped at a stowage bin to retrieve a cover that had been removed from a station antenna during an earlier flight, and after its return to Earth, may be reused. Godwin and Tani also performed a \\"getahead;\\" task, positioning two switches on the station's exterior to be installed on a future shuttle mission, STS-110. The spacewalk completed a record year with 18 spacewalks conducted: 12 originating from the shuttle and six from the station. =Maintenance and re-supply= Mission managers extended Endeavour's flight to a duration of 12 days to allow Endeavour's crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on a treadmill and replacing a failed compressor in one of the air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module. The astronauts and cosmonauts completed the transfer of more than 5,000 pounds of supplies and material from Endeavour's mid-deck and the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module to the station. The transferred items included more than 850 pounds of food, 1,000 pounds of clothing and other crew provisions, 300 pounds of experiments and associated equipment, 800 pounds of spacewalking gear, and 600 pounds of medical equipment. In turn, the crew packed up the Raffaello module with items bound for a return trip to Earth. =IMU failure= On 12 December 2001, the crew and Mission Control noted a transient problem with one of the shuttle's three inertial measurement units (IMUs), the primary navigation units for the shuttle. Only two of the three IMUs were on line at the time, with the third unit off line to save electricity. The IMU that experienced a problem, designated IMU 2, was immediately taken off line and the third IMU brought on line. IMU 2 operated well after that, but it remained off line and was considered failed by flight controllers. The loss of one IMU had no impact on Endeavour's mission, and the other two units operated in excellent condition. A formal change of command ceremony took place 13 December as Expedition 3 ended its residence and Expedition 4 began theirs. =Reboost and departure= Flight controllers planned slight changes to Endeavour's departure from the station 15 December 2001, allowing time for a small jet firing by the shuttle to boost the station's future path away from a piece of space debris that could pass near the complex. Mission Control was notified that a spent Russian rocket upper stage launched in the 1970s could pass within three miles of the station if Endeavour did not perform the engine firing. With the shuttle reboost, the station was predicted to pass more than 40 miles away from the debris. Because the scheduled reboost used additional propellant, Endeavour did not perform a full-circle flyaround of the station after undocking. Instead, the shuttle undocked from the station, performing a quarter circle flyaround of the complex to a point about 400 feet directly above the station where it fired its engines in a final separation burn at 12:20 am EST, beginning its departure from the orbiting outpost. =Scientific experiments= Endeavour's middeck carried home the results of several experiments completed during Expedition 3's stay on the station. These included the Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility, the Dynamically Controlled Protein Crystal Growth experiment and cells from the Cellular Biotechnology Operations Support System (CBOSS). The CBOSS equipment aboard the space station will remain active during Expedition 4, growing ovarian and colon cancer cells, as well as kidney cells in microgravity. Experiments in Endeavours payload bay were returned for investigators around the world. The Multiple Application Customized Hitchhiker-1 (MACH-1) carried a wide array of experiments, including the Prototype Synchrotron Radiation Detector, the Collisions into Dust Experiment-2, the Capillary Pump Loop, and the Space Experiment Module (SEM). The SEM carried experiments from Argentina, Portugal, Morocco and Australia, as well as experiments from U.S. schoolchildren. Several other canisters in Endeavour's payload bay also carried student experiments. On its return to Earth, Endeavour's crew deployed a small satellite called STARSHINE 2 from a canister located in the payload bay. More than 30,000 students from 660 schools in 26 countries will be tracking STARSHINE 2 as it orbits the Earth for eight months. The students, who helped polish STARSHINE's 845 mirrors, will use the information they collect to calculate the density of the Earth's upper atmosphere. Honoring victims of the September 11 attacks STS-108 was the first Space Shuttle launch following the September 11 attacks, and remembering it would become a focus of the flight. Security was increased at Kennedy Space Center for press and visitors for the launch, and press activity was more tightly controlled.http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/01/16/btsc.obrien.shuttle/ In the early morning hours of 12 September 2001, New York City Police Sergeant Gerald Kane and Detective Peter Friscia, assigned to the office of Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik, retrieved a large American flag that was tattered and torn and wrapped around a flag pole near in corners of Church and Chambers Street amidst the devastation of the World Trade Center site.http://bernardkerik.blogspot.com/2009/02/flag-that-went-to-heaven.html That American flag, a USMC flag recovered from the Pentagon, an American flag that flew over the State Capital in Harrisburg, PA on the day of 11 Sept., the 23 shields (badges) of the fallen NYPD officers; patches, posters and an emblem from the FDNY, patches from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and 6,000 small American flags to honor those lost and those that served in the response and recovery efforts for 9/11 were all flown aboard Endeavour. The 6,000 smaller flags were later given to families that lost loved ones on 9/11 and the flag retrieved from the World Trade Center site is maintained by the Office of the New York City Commissioner of Records.

UKOLN was based at the University of Bath and was funded through a mixture of core and project grants. Latterly it received its core funding solely from JISC, but had received core grants previously from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and the British Library. History UKOLN traces its roots back to 1977, when Maurice Line initiated the Bath University Programme of Catalogue Research with funding from the British Library. This led to the establishment, in 1979, of a research centre under the directorship of Philip Bryant, again with British Library funding. It was known initially as the Centre for Catalogue Research, and later renamed the Centre for Bibliographic Management (CBM) to reflect its broadening research portfolio. In 1989, the British Library established the UK Office for Library Networking to work alongside the CBM. It had one full-time member of staff. In 1992, it merged with the CBM and started to receive additional core funding from JISC. The combined organisation was known briefly as UKOLN: The Office for Library and Information Networking, but three years later this was simplified to the UK Office for Library and Information Networking. In 2002 it became known simply as UKOLN, again reflecting a shift in the focus of its activity. In 1994, Lorcan Dempsey succeeded Philip Bryant as Director of UKOLN. He in turn was succeeded in the role by Liz Lyon in 2000. In May 2013 an article published in the Times Higher Education announced that \\"16 of its 24 University of Bath-based staff [were made] redundant after the cessation of a ¬£622,000 annual grant from the higher education technology body Jisc\\". Although UKOLN continued after 31 July 2013 it was significantly reduced in size and was no longer working in many of the areas which were responsible for its visibility in national and international arenas. UKOLN's Director departed without replacement in late 2013. The remaining staff were made redundant or redeployed in July 2015, marking the cessation of UKOLN's activities. Work UKOLN's main work included: *influencing policy and informing practice; *promoting community-building and consensus making by actively raising awareness; *advancing knowledge through research and development; *building innovative systems and services based on Web technologies; *acting as an agent for knowledge transfer. Its specialist areas included metadata, interoperability and digital curation. It was involved in a range of national and international projects including the DELOS Network of Excellence in Digital Libraries, the Development of a European Service for Information on Research and Education (DESIRE), the Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research (DRIVER, a precursor to OpenAIRE), the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, the Knowledge and Information Management (KIM) Grand Challenge Project, and the development of the SWORD interoperability standard and the Bath Profile of the Z39.50 standard. It was a founder member of the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) in 2004. UKOLN published the Ariadne (Web magazine), targeted principally at information science professionals in academia, archives, libraries and museums, and the International Journal of Digital Curation. UKOLN also organised many events, including the annual Institutional Web Management Workshop and the International Digital Curation Conference.

In 1964, M. Brotherton in his book \\"Masers and Lasers; How They Work, What They Do\\" on p. 5, wrote about laser beams and used the term \\"superhighways\\" for communication.M. Brotherton, \\"Masers and Lasers; How They Work, What They Do,\\" (McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1964). In 1974, Nam June Paik used the term \\"super highway\\" in application to telecommunications, which gave rise to the opinion that he may have been the author of the term \\"information superhighway\\". In fact, in his 1974 proposal \\"Media Planning for the Postindustrial Society ‚Äì The 21st Century is now only 26 years away\\" to the Rockefeller Foundation he used a slightly different phrase, \\"electronic super highway\\": In 1972, Andrew Targowski presented the Polish National Development Program at the State Council for Informatics, which included the plan of developing the public computer network INFOSTRADA (INFO-STRADA), where autostrada means motorway in Polish. Later this plan and its topology were published in his book INFORMATYKA modele rozwoju i system√≥w (INFORMATICS, models of development and systems)Warsaw: PWE,pp. 197‚Äì199 > The building of new electronic super highways will become an even huger > enterprise.

Vicksburg was first laid down as Cheyenne on 26 October 1942 at Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, but, exactly one month later, was renamed Vicksburg. The light cruiser was launched on 14 December 1943; sponsored by Miss Muriel Hamilton, the daughter of Mayor J. C. Hamilton, of Vicksburg, Mississippi; and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 12 June 1944, with Captain William C. Vose in command. Vicksburg received two battle stars for her World War II service. Service history =World War II= The ship was fitted out for sea at Norfolk, Virginia into July, and conducted the preliminary phases of her shakedown in Chesapeake Bay prior to sailing for the British West Indies on 7 August. The light cruiser, then operating out of Trinidad, completed her shakedown training in the Gulf of Paria from 12‚Äì30 August, conducted shore bombardment exercises off Culebra, Puerto Rico, on 1 September, and on the following day, sailed for Hampton Roads in company with and . Returning to Hampton Roads soon thereafter, Vicksburg then conducted radar spotting practice at YAG-13 and at a battle raft on 9 September, and fired a drone practice off Cape May on 10 September. She underwent a post- shakedown overhaul at the Boston Navy Yard from 11‚Äì24 September, ran standardization trials off Rockland, Maine, and then took part in naval radiation laboratory tests in the vicinity of Deer Island in Boston Harbor. After availability at Boston, Vicksburg operated in Narragansett Bay, Block Island Sound, and Long Island Sound, serving as a pre-commissioning training vessel for crews of large combatant warships from 5‚Äì15 December. Vicksburg returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard on 17 December, and remained there until she ran her post-repair trials in the Chesapeake Bay on the last two days of 1944. The warship departed Hampton Roads on 1 January 1945, and rendezvoused with and at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay to form Task Group (TG) 21.12. Vicksburg and her escorts arrived at Cristobal, Canal Zone, four days later, transited the Panama Canal that afternoon, and moored at NOB Balboa, Panama, where TG 21.12 was dissolved. Vicksburg got underway for the Hawaiian Islands on 6 January 1945, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 17 January. The light cruiser then conducted exercises off Oahu, including aircraft tracking, firing at drones, fighter direction, radar calibration, and long and short range battle practices, through the end of January. Vicksburg departed Pearl Harbor at 0800 on 5 February, and arrived at Saipan, in the Marianas, on 13 February. There, she was fueled from and prepared for the ship's upcoming operation, and her baptism of fire, bombarding the shore to support Operation Detachment, landings on Iwo Jima in the Japanese Volcano Islands by the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions. Iwo Jima The following day, Vicksburg left Saipan and joined other units of TG 52.19 at sea. On 15 February, the light cruiser became part of Task Unit (TU) 54.9.2, movement group \\"Baker\\", consisting of herself, and , and , and several destroyers. That force soon split into two fire support units. Vicksburg joined Chester and Pensacola, and took station at 0651 to commence bombarding the shore. At 0709, Vicksburg catapult-launched the first of her plane sorties and commenced fire. Directed by the ship's spotter in an OS2U Kingfisher, the light cruiser's 6-inch guns opened up from a range of 12,000 yards, shelling enemy installations on the northern end of the island of Iwo Jima. Squalls cut down the visibility for the spotting aircraft, but occasionally, the aircrew managed to glimpse the target area. At 0808, Vicksburg completed the first phase of her bombardment mission and recovered her plane to refuel it. At 0947, the light cruiser commenced the second phase of her assigned mission. Still hampered by bad weather over the target, the spotters doggedly remained airborne and directed gunfire as well as they could through the spotty cloud cover. By afternoon, however, visibility had increased markedly, allowing the ship to assess her gunfire as landing \\"on target,\\" in the third phase. Vicksburg had launched her Kingfisher at 1249, piloted by Lieutenant J. B. Nabors, Jr. At 1414, listeners on the radio circuit heard Nabors report that his aircraft was being fired upon by Japanese anti-aircraft guns. Shortly thereafter, an A6M Zero attacked the slower, more vulnerable Kingfisher. The ensuing air battle did not last long, however, and ended happily for the American side, when another Kingfisher, from Pensacola, bagged the Zero, enabling Vicksburgs plane to resume her air spotting activities unhindered by enemy interference in the air. One half-hour later, Vicksburg completed Phase III of her gunfire assignment and recovered the Kingfisher. Shortly before 1600, the light cruiser again launched one of her brood of float planes, and, at 1618, commenced Phase IV from a range of 10,000 yards. After completing the firing at 1727 and subsequently recovering her aircraft, Vicksburg and her consorts were joined by the other fire support ships in retiring for the night at 14 knots. Vicksburg remained off Iwo Jima, providing gunfire support for the landings, into March and headed for Ulithi on 5 March to replenish and provision before putting to sea again on 14 March in TG 58.1, part of the 5th Fleet's fast carrier striking arm, which was then undertaking air strikes to neutralize Japanese air power as the Allies prepared to invade Okinawa. Vicksburgs first brush with the Japanese while engaged in that screening duty came on 18 March 100 miles east of the Japanese home island of Ky≈´sh≈´. A Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" made a torpedo attack on the cruiser, dropping her \\"fish\\" while the ship was in the middle of a tight emergency turn. The torpedo churned by the bow, some 35 yards ahead of the ship, and proceeded parallel to the cruiser's port side. Within 20 minutes, another enemy plane closed, dropped flares, and departed, hurried along on its way by antiaircraft fire from the ships of TG 58.1. Soon thereafter, Vicksburg, already at general quarters, opened fire with her 40 mm Bofors battery. The plane came in through the formation, and Vicksburgs Bofors guns began blasting the plane after it had already been set ablaze by fire from other ships. Moments later, it splashed. At 0600, a Yokosuka P1Y \\"Frances\\" closed the formation and approached one of the carriers in the group from astern. It soon executed a wingover and dived on the carrier through a curtain of flak. The enemy never reached his destination, however, for the heavy wall of gunfire, probably from the carrier herself, knocked the \\"Frances\\" into the water. Slightly less than two hours later, a Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy\\" bored in for a surprise attack and passed over Vicksburg. The light cruiser's battery blasted away at the intruder and scored three definite hits before 5 inch gunfire (probably from either or blasted the enemy from the sky. Meanwhile, the carriers' planes battered Japanese targets ashore on the Japanese home islands. The cruisers and destroyers in the screen had no rest, for the Japanese came back again on the next day. At 0715, a Japanese plane dived toward and scored one bomb hit. Vicksburg soon opened fire on the enemy plane. As it turned, either to make another attack or to escape the American fighters from the combat air patrol, the Japanese plane was rocked by a proximity burst from one of Vicksburgs shells. The blast knocked off a wing and set the plane afire. It then spun into the sea, a confirmed \\"kill.\\" While she was supporting strikes against Japanese targets to weaken the enemy's ability to defend against the impending invasion of the Ryukyus, Vicksburg destroyed eight Japanese planes. In addition, one of the ship's Kingfishers rescued a Marine aviator from the waters off the Japanese home islands. Okinawa Later detached from service with TG 58.1, Vicksburg shifted to a position off Okinawa for shore bombardment and close support duties. Highlighting the operation for the light cruiser was firing nearly 2,300 rounds of 6 inch and 5 inch projectiles in a six-hour time span, supporting an Army advance up the southern part of the island. Some of her targets were only a few hundred yards ahead of the advancing troops, a situation that required accurate shooting. Vicksburgs guns blasted Japanese gun positions, caves, and strong-points during the ship's long hours of firing and loading ammunition on the veritable \\"front lines.\\" After leaving the Ryukyus late in the Okinawa campaign, Vicksburg supported a minesweeping operation in the East China Sea until 24 June, when she sailed for the Philippine Islands. Vicksburg remained in Philippine waters through the Japanese capitulation on 15 August 1945. Five days later, on 20 August, the light cruiser departed San Pedro Bay, Leyte, as part of TU 30.3.7, in company with , , and . While the ships proceeded toward a point off the Japanese home islands, where they would rendezvous with a fast carrier striking force, Lowry sighted and exploded a drifting mine. Vicksburg joined TG 38.2 on 24 August, part of Vice Admiral John McCain's task force, and was replenished and provisioned at sea. TG 38.2 covered the approaches to Tokyo Bay prior to, and during, the formal Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945. Three days later, Vicksburg entered Tokyo Bay. =Post-War= There, Rear Admiral Lloyd J. Wiltse, Commander, Cruiser Division 10, shifted his flag to Vicksburg, and on 20 September, the light cruiser departed Tokyo Bay as part of a 3rd Fleet task group under the command of Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth and proceeded to Okinawa, where she anchored at Buckner Bay, on 23 September. There, 2,200 passengers came on board for transportation back to the United States. Five days after arrival in Pearl Harbor on 4 October, Vicksburg led the sortie of the 3rd Fleet for the United States. On 15 October, the Fleet passed in review in San Francisco Bay, California. Vicksburg remained in that port until 26 October, when she got underway to shift to Monterey Bay, California, to take part in Navy Day observances there on 27 October. The ship reached Long Beach, California, on 31 October, but shifted to Portland, Oregon, on 6 November to participate in Armistice Day services before returning to Long Beach on 16 November. Placed in the Terminal Island Naval Shipyard in San Francisco Bay on 17 January 1946 for availability, Vicksburg emerged from the overhaul and modernization as perhaps the most modern ship of her class. On 20 May 1946, Vicksburg became the flagship for Vice Admiral Frederick C. Sherman, Commander, 3rd Fleet, who shifted his flag from on that date. Two days later, the ship moved to San Diego, where she moored at the Naval Air Station (NAS). She remained there into September, when Vice Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery temporarily broke his flag in her. Vicksburg was ultimately decommissioned on 30 June 1947 at San Francisco, California. She remained \\"mothballed\\" until struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1962. Sold to the National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, California, on 25 August 1964, she was then scrapped.

The Green River Formation is an Eocene geologic formation that records the sedimentation in a group of intermountain lakes in three basins along the present-day Green River in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. The sediments are deposited in very fine layers, a dark layer during the growing season and a light-hue inorganic layer in the dry season. Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year. The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years. The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm, with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm.Bradley, W. H. The varves and climate of the Green River epoch: U.S. Geol. Survey Prof. Paper 158, pp 87‚Äì110, 1929. The sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named for the Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. The three separate basins lie around the Uinta Mountains (north, east, and south) of northeastern Utah: * an area in northwestern Colorado east of the Uintas * a larger area in the southwest corner of Wyoming just north of the Uintas known as Lake Gosiute * the largest area, in northeastern Utah and western Colorado south of the Uintas, known as Lake Uinta Fossil Butte National Monument in Lincoln County, Wyoming is in a part of the formation known as Fossil Lake because of its abundance of exceptionally well preserved fish fossils. Lithology and formation Areas of oil shale of the Green River Formation, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming (USGS) The formation of intermontane basin / lake environments during the Eocene resulted from mountain building and uplift of the Rocky Mountains (late Cretaceous Sevier orogeny and the Paleogene Laramide orogeny). Tectonic highlands supplied the Eocene sedimentary basins with sediment from all directions: the Uinta Mountains in the center; the Wind River Mountains to the north; the Front Range, Park Range and Sawatch Range of the Colorado Rockies to the east; the Uncompahgre Plateau and the San Juan Mountains to the south and finally, the Wasatch Mountains of Utah and the ranges of eastern Idaho to the west. The lithology of the lake sediments is varied and includes sandstones, mudstones, siltstones, oil shales, coal beds, saline evaporite beds, and a variety of lacustrine limestones and dolomites. Volcanic ash layers within the various sediments from the then active Absaroka Volcanic field to the north in the vicinity of Yellowstone and the San Juan volcanic field to the southeast provide dateable horizons within the sediments. The trona (hydrated sodium bicarbonate carbonate) beds of Sweetwater County, Wyoming are noted for a variety of rare evaporite minerals. The Green River Formation, is the type locality for eight rare minerals: bradleyite, ewaldite, loughlinite, mckelveyite-(Y), norsethite, paralabuntsovite-Mg, shortite and wegscheiderite. It also has a natural occurrence of moissanite (SiC) and 23 other valid mineral species. Cyclicity The beds display a pronounced cyclicity, with the precession, obliquity, and eccentricity orbital components all clearly detectable. This enables the beds to be internally dated with a high degree of accuracy, and astrochronological dates agree very well with radiometric dates. Fossil zones Diplomystus (left) and Knightia (right), two fossil fish from one of the lake beds in the Green River Formation Within the Green River Formation of southwest Wyoming in the area known as Fossil Lake, two distinct zones of very fine-grained lime muds are particularly noted for preserving a variety of complete and detailed fossils. These layers are an Eocene Lagerst√§tte, a rare place where conditions were right for a rich accumulation of undisturbed fossils. The most productive zone‚Äîcalled the split fish layer‚Äîconsists of a series of laminated or varved lime muds about thick, which contains abundant fish and other fossils. These are easily split along the layers to reveal the fossils. This thin zone represents some 4000 years of deposition. The second fossil zone, the 18 inch layer, is an unlaminated layer about thick that also contains abundant detailed fossils, but is harder to work because it is not composed of fissile laminae. Diplomystus dentatus Prepared by Fossil Shack from the Green River Formation Split Fish Layer The limestone matrix is so fine-grained that fossils include rare soft parts of complete insects and fallen leaves in spectacular detail. More than twenty-two orders of insects are represented in the Green River collection at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., alone. Fish fossils of Diplomystus and Knightia are found in Fossil Lake but not in Lake Gosiute. Only Lake Gosiute has fossils of catfish (Ictaluridae and Hypsidoridae) and suckers (Catostomidae). The catfish are found mostly in the deepest parts of the lake.Morton, Glenn R., 2003, Creationist Misuse of the Green River Formation , accessed May 2, 2009 Unidentified bird from the Green River Formation with preserved feathers Stromatolite fossil from the Eocene Lake Gosuite, Laney Member, Green River Formation of south-western Wyoming The various fossil beds of the Green River Formation span a 5 million year period, dating to between 53.5 and 48.5 million years old.Smith, M. E., Singer, B., & Carroll, A. (2003). 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of the Eocene Green River Formation, Wyoming. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 115(5), 549-565. This span of time includes the transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles, which do not tolerate frost, and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore ( e.g. Platanus wyomingensis https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/eoc/greenriver.html) forests. As the lake configurations shifted, each Green River location is distinct in character and time. The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements, receiving sediments from the Uinta highland and the Rocky Mountains to the east and north. The lagerst√§tten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds. Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away, so leaves of palms, ferns and sycamores, some showing the insect damage they had sustained during their growth, were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved. Insects were preserved whole, even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets. Vertebrates were preserved too, including the scutes of Borealosuchus, the crocodile that was an early clue to the mild Eocene climate of Western North America. Fish are common. The fossils of the herring-like Knightia, sometimes in dense layers, as if a school had wandered into anoxic water levels and were overcome, are familiar to fossil-lovers and are among the most commonly available fossils on the commercial market. There were two genera of indigenous freshwater stingray, Heliobatis and Asterotrygon. Approximately sixty vertebrate taxa in all have been found at Green River. Besides fishes they include at least eleven species of reptiles, and some birds and one armadillo-like mammal, Brachianodon westorum, with some scattered vertebrae of others, like the dog-sized Meniscotherium and Notharctus, one of the first primates. The earliest known bats (Icaronycteris index , and Onychonycteris finneyi), already full-developed for flight, are found here. Even a snake, Boavus idelmani, found its way into a lake and was preserved in the mudstone. =Discovery of the fossil beds= The first documented records of (invertebrate) fossils from what is now called the Green River Formation are in the journals of early missionaries and explorers such as S. A. Parker, 1840, and J. C. Fremont, 1845. Geologist Dr. John Evans collected the first fossil fish, described as Culpea humilis (later renamed Knightia eocaena), from the Green River beds in 1856. Edward Drinker Cope collected extensively from the area and produced several publications on the fossil fish from 1870 onwards. Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden (geologist-in-charge of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories, the forerunner of the United States Geological Survey) first used the name \\"Green River Shales\\" for the fossil sites in 1869. Millions of fish fossils have been collected from the area, commercial collectors operating from legal quarries on state and private land have been responsible for the majority of Green River vertebrate fossils in public and private collections all over the world.Lance Grande (1984) Paleontology of the Green River Formation, with a review of the fish fauna. Geological Survey of Wyoming Bull. 63, p. 10 Oil shale Oil Shale from the Mahogany Zone of the Green River Formation, Colorado. Weathered surface on right; fresh surface on left. Green River Formation Oil Gas Fields within the Uinta Basin and Piceance Basin The Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposit in the world. It has been estimated that the oil shale reserves could equal up to of shale oil, up to half of which may be recoverable by shale oil extraction technologies (pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution of kerogen in oil shale).GAO: Unconventional Oil and Gas Production However, the estimates of recoverable oil has been questioned, back in 2013, by geophysicist Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, who argued that the technology for recovering oil from the Green River oil shale deposit had not been developed and had not been profitably implemented at any significant scale. Green River oil shale is lacustrine type lamosite. The organic matter is from blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). Notable mineral deposits The unusual chemistry of the lakes in which it was deposited makes the Green River Formation a major source of sodium carbonate. In southwest Wyoming the formation contains the world's largest deposits of trona, and in Colorado, the world's largest deposits of nahcolite.George I.

The ship, the second US Navy ship to bear the name, was named for the city of Miami, Florida. Miami was commissioned in December 1943, and saw service in several campaigns in the Pacific. Like almost all her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, and never saw active service again. Miami was scrapped in the early 1960s. Construction Miami was laid down 2 August 1941 by Cramp Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia, and launched 8 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. C. H. Reeder, wife of the mayor of Miami, Florida She was commissioned 28 December 1943, Captain John G. Crawford in command. Service history =Marianas campaign, June-October 1944= After shakedown in the Caribbean and training along the Atlantic coast, the new light cruiser, accompanied by her sister-ships and , departed Boston on 16 April 1944 for the Pacific, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, reaching Pearl Harbor on 6 May. Miami joined the Fast Carrier Task Force for air strikes in June against Saipan, Tinian, Rota, Guam, Pagan, and the Bonin Islands in support of the Marianas campaign. During July, Miami operated west of the Marianas with the carriers as they gave close air support to ground forces struggling to take the islands. Early in August she supported raids on Iwo Jima and Haha Jima in the Bonins before steaming to Eniwetok for upkeep. Her carriers hit Peleliu and Angaur in the Palaus, 7 September, and bombed targets in the Philippines from the 12th through the 15th. During these strikes her scout planes on four occasions rescued American pilots who had been shot down in enemy waters. The cruiser continued to support strikes against the Palaus and the Philippines until returning to Saipan on the 29th for replenishment. Miami departed Ulithi for strikes on Okinawa on 10-14 October. While her task group was under air attack on the night of 12/13 October, Miamis guns brought down their first enemy plane and assisted in splashing another. Planes from her carriers hit targets on Luzon on 18 October. =Battle of Leyte Gulf, October 1944= On 20 October, the 7th Fleet landed General MacArthur on the shores of Leyte, fulfilling his pledge to the Philippines: \\"I shall return.\\" Realizing the decisive strategic importance of the Philippines Archipelago, Japan mustered her naval force for a major counter-offensive to turn back the invasion. Her navy converged on Leyte Gulf from three directions: a northern force steamed above Luzon to lure the 3rd Fleet north and out of the action, a Japanese Center Force struck through the San Bernardino Strait and followed the coast of Samar toward Leyte, and a southern force emerged through Surigao Strait to trap and destroy the amphibious ships in the gulf. The American Navy parried these thrusts in four actions collectively known as the Battle for Leyte Gulf. Operating with Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan's Carrier task group, Miami protected , , , , and . Planes from the carriers located and heavily attacked the Japanese Center Force in the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October, sinking and so badly damaging that she was forced to retire from action. The whole Japanese Center Force turned back to regroup, leading Admiral Halsey to conclude that they were retiring for good. When word of the northern force off Luzon arrived that afternoon, Halsey ordered the carriers to speed north to attack. Miami accompanied them at flank speed as carrier aircraft sank four Japanese carriers and several supporting ships. When Halsey learned that the Center Force had again reversed course and had steamed through the San Bernardino Strait to threaten the American amphibious ships off the beachhead at Leyte, he ordered Bogan's group south. However, the Japanese ships of the Center Force were stopped and turned back by a handful of minor American ships: three destroyers, four destroyer escorts, and six escort carriers. Nevertheless, Miami and her consorts managed to catch the Japanese destroyer off the entrance to San Bernardino Strait. With the guns of the other cruisers and destroyers, Miamis six-inch guns sank her. =Operations, 1944-45= After participating in carrier strikes on the Philippines during November, Miami encountered a typhoon while operating east of Luzon on 18 December. During the morning one of the ship's aircraft was carried away, and in the afternoon her hull was damaged by buckling. As the storm abated the next day, she searched for survivors of damaged and lost ships. On January 1945, the ship operated in air strikes on Formosa, Luzon, French Indochina, South China Coast, Hainan, and Hong Kong. She transited Balintang Channel, Luzon Straits, on 20 January 1945, and the next day, while engaged in an air strike against Formosa, Miami sighted a Mitsubishi A6M Zero type enemy plane above the formation and shot it down. On 1 February the ship steamed close to Japan for air strikes against targets in the Tokyo area. In mid-March, Miami began operating east of Okinawa, and continued in that area, encountering frequent enemy air opposition, until late in April. Leaving Ulithi on 10 May 1945, touching Pearl Harbor on the 17th, Miami proceeded to the United States for overhaul, arriving San Francisco on 24 May, where she remained until after the cessation of hostilities, returning to Pearl Harbor on 25 August. In September and October Miami operated in the Ry≈´ky≈´s accepting the surrender of the small islands north of Okinawa. After a brief visit to Yokosuka, Japan, she steamed to the Carolines and arrived at Truk on 11 November to conduct a survey of bombing damage to the famous naval base there. =Post-war operations, 1945-47= Ordered home on 25 November, Miami arrived at Long Beach on 10 December. She operated on the California coast training naval reservists until decommissioning on 30 June 1947 and entering the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Miamis name was struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1961 and her hulk was sold for scrapping to Nicholai Joffe Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., on 26 July 1962. Awards Miami received six battle stars for World War II service.

Merrill chose her for the flagship of Cruiser Division 12 (CruDiv 12). On 25 January, she reached Efate, New Hebrides, her home base for the next few months. While making a sweep around beleaguered Guadalcanal, she participated in the Battle of Rennell Island on 29 January, the last naval engagement of the Guadalcanal Campaign. USS Montpelier before her 1944 refit. Montpelier covered the landings on the Russell Islands on 21 February. On the night of 5‚Äì6 March, she heavily bombarded the Vila‚ÄëStanmore airfield on Kolombangara in the Solomons, and helped sink an enemy destroyer in the Battle of Blackett Strait. She and three other cruisers bombarded Poporang Island (in the Shortland Islands) on the night of 29‚Äì30 June, in preparation for the invasion of New Georgia. On the night of 11‚Äì12 July, she bombarded fortifications on Munda, enabling troops to continue their conquest of New Georgia. She patrolled the New Georgia area for the next four months to prevent Japanese troop withdrawals. After a voyage to Sydney, Australia, she joined Task Force 39 (TF 39) as its flagship for the invasion of the Treasury and Bougainville Islands. On 1 November, Montpelier shelled the Buka‚ÄëBonis airfields on the northern tip of Bougainville, and hit the Japanese defenses on the islands of Poporang and Balalae, in the Shortlands. TF 39, consisting of cruisers and destroyers, engaged a superior Japanese force in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay while guarding transports on the night of 2 November. The result was a victory for the U.S. ships commanded by Admiral Merrill. The victory turned back the Japanese from what would have been a disastrous assault on the Bougainville landing forces. Besides assisting in the destruction of one ship, Montpeliers gunners shot down five enemy planes. From 15‚Äì19 February 1944, Montpelier covered the amphibious landing on the Green Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago. In March, she hunted shipping south of Truk and participated in the invasion of the Emiraus. On 20 May 1944, Montpelier received light damage from return fire when she and two other light cruisers, along with eight destroyers, bombarded shore installations on Shortland, Poporang, and Magusaiai islands in the Shortlands. On 1 October 1944, the US Navy's Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), and began shelling Saipan on 14 June to support the Mariana Islands invasion. She joined TF 58 and participated in the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea from 19‚Äì21 June. During the engagement, Japanese carrier air groups were virtually annihilated. Montpelier returned to the Marianas, and continued her shelling of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. She left the Marianas on 2 August for overhauling in the United States.

Beginning on 12 December, Montpelier provided beach cover for the invasion of Mindoro. Fighting kamikazes, she protected troops at the Lingayen Gulf landing in January 1945. In February, she supported operations off Mariveles Harbor, Corregidor, and Palawan, and from 14‚Äì23 April, she covered the landings on Mindanao. From her base at Subic Bay, she steamed to Brunei Bay, Borneo, arriving on 9 June. From 17 June to 2 July, she sailed off the oil center at Balikpapan, providing support for minesweepers, underwater demolition teams, and amphibious forces. During the latter part of July and early August, Montpelier made three anti-shipping sweeps in the East China Sea as part of Task Force 95. =Post-War= When hostilities ended, she anchored off Wakayama, Japan, and helped accelerate the evacuation of Allied prisoners. After an inspection of Japanese ships, part of her crew went ashore to view the ruins of Hiroshima. On 18 October she covered the landing of occupation forces at Matsuyama. Montpelier departed from Hiro Wan and Japanese waters on 15 November for the East Coast, having battled the enemy from their deepest point of advance to their very homeland. From the Pacific, Montpelier sailed first for Hawaii, then to San Diego, California, before heading south to pass through the Panama Canal, with her final destination being New York City. She reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet on 11 December, and on 1 July 1946 reported for duty with the 16th Fleet.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1908 as a member of the Conservative Party. In January 1917, he became Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada when his predecessor, Albert S√©vigny, was appointed to the Canadian Cabinet. Rhodes was retained in the position following the 1917 election that fall, becoming the third Speaker since James Cockburn to preside over more than one Parliament. In 1921, he was made a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada before retiring from politics to become president of the British-American Nickel Company, whose previous president had been James Hamet Dunn. The company failed in 1925, and he returned to provincial politics. Prior to the 1925 provincial election, he was asked to become leader of the Nova Scotia Conservative Party after the leader of the party, W. L. Hall, was assaulted on the waterfront. Rhodes took over the party and led it to victory in the 1925 election. The Conservatives defeated a Liberal government that had been in power for forty-three years but had been, in its last years, wracked by an economic downturn and severe labour unrest among miners in Cape Breton. Rhodes ran on a Maritime Rights platform, promising to curtail federal influence and stop the exodus of people from the province. The Tories more than doubled their seats in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, winning forty out of forty-three seats. An important factor in their victory was the failure of the governing Liberals to resolve a long strike by the province's coal miners. When Cape Breton coal miner William Davis was killed by company police in a confrontation on June 11, voters looked to the Tories for solutions. Rhodes engineered a settlement of the dispute and appointed a royal commission. The new government later introduced pensions for teachers and allowances for widowed mothers. His government also abolished the Legislative Council, the province's appointed Upper House, but first had to go to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to obtain permission to appoint enough new members to the Council to secure a vote for its abolition. The Rhodes government was re-elected in 1928 with a reduced majority. He returned to federal politics to become Minister of Fisheries under Prime Minister R.B. Bennett. From 1932 to 1935, he served as federal Finance Minister, and, despite the Great Depression, handed down austere budgets that increased taxes and reduced spending. He was appointed to the Senate of Canada three months before the 1935 federal election that routed Bennett's government. He remained a Senator until his death in 1942 in Ottawa. He is buried in Ottawa's Beechwood Cemetery. On July 12, 1905, he married Mary Grace Pipes, daughter of William Thomas Pipes, Rhodes' law partner and Premier of Nova Scotia from 1882 to 1884. They had one son, Edgar Nelson, and one daughter, Helen Sybil.

Gottfried von Strassburg (died c. 1210) is the author of the Middle High German courtly romance ', an adaptation of the 12th-century Tristan and Iseult legend. Gottfried's work is regarded, alongside the Nibelungenlied and Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, as one of the great narrative masterpieces of the German Middle Ages. He is probably also the composer of a small number of surviving lyrics. His work became a source of inspiration for Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde (1865). Life Other than an origin in or close association with Strasbourg, nothing is known of his life. It would seem, however, that he was a man of good birth and position, who filled an important municipal office in his native city of Strasbourg,This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: but since he is always referred to in German as Meister (master) and not Herr (sir), it seems safe to assume he was not a knight, a conclusion supported by the rather dismissive attitude toward knightly exploits shown in Tristan. Tristan ends abruptly, and according to the testimony of Ulrich von T√ºrheim and Heinrich von Freiberg, two people who provided endings for Tristan, Gottfried died before finishing the work. References in the work suggest it was written during the first decade of the 13th century, and 1210 is taken, conventionally, as the date of Gottfried's death. His thorough familiarity with Latin literature and rhetorical theory suggest someone who had enjoyed a high level of monastic education. He also shows detailed technical knowledge of music and hunting, far beyond anything found in the works of his contemporaries. Gottfried draws more on the learned tradition of medieval humanism than on the chivalric ethos shared by his major literary contemporaries. He also appears to have been influenced by the writings of contemporary Christian mystics, in particular Bernard of Clairvaux. Although he was highly educated, it is almost certain that he was not a priest. Of this his occasional sneers at the clergy are perhaps a better proof than the morality of much of his work. That his home was in Strasbourg is supported by the fact that the earliest manuscripts of Tristan, dating from the first half of the 13th century, show features of Alemannic and specifically Alsatian dialect. Style Gottfried's rhetorical style is very distinct among his contemporaries. It is incredibly complex, marked by the extensive use of symmetrical structure in his organization of Tristan as a whole, as well as in the structure of individual passages. Gottfried also uses detailed word and sound patterns, playing with such things as rhyme, alliteration, and assonance. See Batts (1971) for a detailed analysis. One of the greatest hallmarks of Gottfried's style is his skillful use of irony, to both humorous and tragic effects. He may also have relied on irony to disguise his criticisms of contemporary society in order to avoid censure. Sources Gottfried states that the Tristan of Thomas of Britain, an Anglo-French work of around 1160, was the source of his work. He explains that he bases himself on Thomas because he \\"told the tale correctly\\", distancing himself from the less courtly versions of the story represented by B√©roul in Old French and Eilhart von Oberge in Middle High German. Unfortunately, Thomas's work, too, is fragmentary and there is little overlap with Gottfried's poem, making it difficult to evaluate Gottfried's originality directly. However, Thomas's Tristan was the source of a number of other versions, which makes it possible to get some idea of style and content. It is clear that while Gottfried's statement of his reliance on and debt to Thomas is correct, he both expanded on his source and refined the story psychologically. The discovery in 1995 of the Carlise Fragment of Thomas's Tristan, which includes material from one of the central parts of the story, the Love Grotto episode, promises a better understanding of Gottfried's use of his source. Thomas's source, in turn, is a now lost Old French Tristan story, reconstructed by Joseph B√©dier, which derives ultimately from Celtic legend. Text The text of Tristan is 19,548 lines long, and is written, like all courtly romances, in rhyming couplets. The first section (ll. 1-44) of the prologue is written in quatrains and is referred to as the \\"strophic prologue\\", while pairs of quatrains, of sententious content, mark the main divisions of the story. The initial letters of the quatrains, indicated by large initials in some manuscripts, form an acrostic with the names Gotefrid- Tristan-Isolde, which runs throughout the poem. In addition, the initial letters of the quatrains in the prologue give the name Dieterich, which is assumed to have been the name of Gottfried's patron. If Gottfried had completed Tristan it would probably have been around 24,000 lines long. Story The story starts with the courtship of Tristan's parents. Riwalin, King of Parmenie, travels to the court of King Marke in Cornwall, where he and Marke's sister, Blanschefleur, fall in love. Blanschfleur becomes pregnant and the couple steal back to Parmenie, but Riwalin is killed in battle. When she hears the news, Blanschfleur dies, but the baby is delivered and survives. He is named Tristan because of the sorrowful circumstances of his birth. Tristan grows up in Parmenie, passed off as the son of Riwalin's marshal Rual li Fointeant, becoming the perfect courtier. While on board a merchant ship which has docked in Parmenie, Tristan is abducted by the Norwegian crew. Once at sea, the ship is struck by a tempest, the crew conclude that they are being punished by God for abducting Tristan, so they set him ashore in a country that turns out to be Cornwall. Tristan encounters a hunting party, whom he astonishes with his skill, and he accompanies them to Marke's court, where his many accomplishments make him popular, particularly with Marke. Eventually, after years of searching, Rual comes to Cornwall and finds Tristan, who is now revealed as Marke's nephew. Tristan is knighted. Cornwall is being forced to pay tribute to the King of Ireland, Gurmun, collected by his brother, the monstrous Morold. Tristan challenges Morold to a duel and defeats him, though he becomes wounded by Morold's poisoned sword. In order to seek a cure Tristan travels to Ireland incognito (under the name Tantris), and contrives to get himself cured by Gurmun's Queen Isolde (Isolde the Wise). He is struck by the beauty and accomplishments of her daughter, Isolde the Fair, and returns to Cornwall singing her praises. Jealous of Tristan, Marke's councillors press him to marry, so that Tristan can be ousted as heir. Hoping that he will be killed in the process, they suggest Tristan be sent to Ireland to woo Isolde for Marke. Tristan travels to Ireland (as Tantris) and kills a dragon which has been threatening the countryside, thus winning Isolde's hand. However, observing that the splinter previously found in Morold's skull matches Tantris's sword, Isolde realises Tantris is in fact Tristan, and threatens to kill him as he sits in the bath. Her mother and her kinswoman Brangaene intervene and Tristan explains the purpose of his journey, which leads to a reconciliation between Ireland and Cornwall. Tristan leaves for Cornwall with Isolde as a bride for Marke. Isolde the Wise has given Brangaene a magic potion to be drunk by Marke and Isolde on their wedding night to ensure their love. On the voyage, however, it is drunk by Tristan and Isolde by mistake. They avow their love for each other, but know that it cannot be made public, and they enjoy a brief idyll on board before arriving in Cornwall. This is followed by a series of intrigues in which the lovers attempt to dupe Marke, starting with the wedding night, when the virgin Brangaene substitutes for Isolde in the marriage bed. Marke is suspicious but is constantly outwitted by the lovers' guile. Eventually, Marke resigns himself to their love and banishes them from court. They go off into the wilderness, to a Love Grotto, where they enjoy an idyllic life away from society. By accident, Marke discovers the grotto and sees them lying side by side. However, aware of his approach, Tristan has placed his sword between himself and Isolde, duping Marke into believing that perhaps they are not lovers after all. With their secret hideaway discovered, the lovers return to court. However, Marke's suspicions return and finally he finds them together and can no longer doubt their adultery. Tristan flees to Normandy, where he encounters Isolde of the White Hands, daughter of the Duke of Arundel. Gottfried's poem ends with Tristan expressing his emotional confusion over the two Isoldes. In Thomas's poem, which is preserved from around this point, Tristan marries Isolde of the White Hands, though the marriage is never consummated. Tristan creates a hall of statues, with statues of Isolde and Brangaene. Tristan is wounded with a poisoned spear by Estult li Orgillus, and sends for Isolde the Fair, who is the only one who can cure him. It is agreed that the ship sent for her will bear a white sail if it returns with her on board, but a black sail if not. However, the jealous Isolde of the White Hands lies about the colour of the sail, and Isolde the Fair arrives to find Tristan dead of grief. She kisses him and dies. Interpretation Gottfried's Tristan has proved problematic to interpret, probably in part because it was arguably left unfinished. Much of critics' difficulty in interpreting the work was entirely intentional on the part of Gottfried; his extensive use of irony in the text is clearly the greatest cause of disagreement over the meaning of his poem. \\"Tristan\\" contrasts significantly with the works of Gottfried's contemporaries in three ways: * The hero of Tristan is a primarily an artist and trickster rather than a knight, that is, he lives on his wits rather than his martial prowess. While Tristan has all the accomplishments of a knight, questions of chivalric ethos are irrelevant to the story and the role of the fighting man in society, central to the works of Hartmann von Aue and Wolfram von Eschenbach, is never at issue. * Contemporary heroes fall in love with a lady because of her beauty and her moral worth. Tristan and Isolde, in spite of their physical beauty and many accomplishments, which cause them to be generally adored, fall in love not for any such explicable reason, but because the love potion leaves them no choice. * Where contemporaries look for balance in life and subordination of the will of the individual (whether to God, or society, or both), Gottfried appears to exalt love as the supreme value, regardless of social consequences and heedless of the sinful nature of Tristan and Isolde's adultery. This \\"exaltation of love\\" has led some critics to see Tristan as effectively heretical, with Tristan and Isolde as \\"saints\\" of a religion of love, though how such a work could have been repeatedly read and copied at 13th century courts remains puzzling. Does the use of religious language imagery for the lovers mean that they represent an alternative religion, or is this simply a technique to communicate their exemplary role and the sublime nature of their love? Alternatively, some critics see the work not as a pure exaltation of love, but rather as an exploration of the conflict between passionate love and courtly social order. That Tristan is not knightly represents a rejection of the norms of feudal society; he allows himself to be guided by love and physical passion rather than chivalry. The deaths of Tristan and Isolde would then seem inevitable, in that their love could not overcome the contemporary social order. The role of the potion remains contentious - is it: * simply a narrative device, of no import in itself, but required to deflect moral criticism? * a symbol of their falling in love? * the cause of their love, indicating love's irrational and irresistible nature? The story itself also raises problems. If the power of the love potion is irresistible, how can Tristan's marriage to Isolde of the White Hands be explained? If love is the supreme value, why do Tristan and Isolde leave their idyllic life in the Love Grotto, to return to a life of occasional secret trysts? Some have even argued that Gottfried abandoned the work, unable to solve these contradictions. Gottfried and his contemporaries One of the most important passages in Tristan, one which owes nothing to Thomas, is the so-called literary excursus, in which Gottfried names and discusses the merits of a number of contemporary lyric and narrative poets. This is the first piece of literary criticism in German. Gottfried praises the Minnes√§nger Reinmar von Hagenau and Walther von der Vogelweide, and the narrative poets Hartmann von Aue, Heinrich von Veldeke and Bligger von Steinach, the former for their musicality, the latter for their clarity, both features which mark Gottfried's own style. Conversely, he criticises, without naming him directly, Wolfram von Eschenbach for the obscurity of his style and the uncouthness of his vocabulary. Reception A page from the Munich MS of Gottfried's Tristan transcription There are 29 known manuscripts of Gottfried's Tristan, dating from the 13th to the 15th century. Of these 11 are complete. Full details are provided in the Marburger Repertorium. The unfinished Tristan was completed by two later poets, Ulrich von T√ºrheim around 1235 and Heinrich von Freiberg around 1290, but their source for the latter part of the story is not Thomas's Tristan, and is generally thought to be the earlier and less courtly version of the story by Eilhart von Oberge, written around 1175. All but two of the complete manuscripts of Gottfried's work include a continuation by Ulrich or Heinrich; one uses the final part of Eilhart's work. Only one has no continuation at all. Gottfried's work is praised by a number of later 13th-century writers, including Rudolf von Ems and Konrad von W√ºrzburg, and was used, together with Eilhart von Oberge's version and Heinrich von Freiberg's continuation as a source for the Old Czech Tristan, written in the latter third of the 14th century. While Gottfried's poem was still being copied in the 15th century, it was Eilhart von Oberge's less sophisticated narrative of the Tristan story that was the source of the first printed version, the 1484 Tristrant und Isalde, a work in prose which is not to be confused with the French Prose Tristan, also known as the Roman de Tristan en Prose. Gottfried's work was rediscovered in the late 18th century, and is the source of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde (1865). Editions The first modern edition of Gottfried's Tristan was that of Christian Heinrich Myller in 1785, and there have been many since. However, there is still no satisfactory critical edition and three editions are in use: * Friedrich Ranke (Weidmann 1930, with corrections 1949). This is the standard edition, but contains no critical apparatus. Most readily available in 3 volumes with Modern German translation, commentary and epilogue by R√ºdiger Krohn (Reclam 1980) , and . The text of Ranke's edition (without line numbering) is available at Projekt Gutenberg-DE. All Tristan literature uses Ranke's line numbering for references to the text. * K. Marold (de Gruyter 1906), republished in 2004 with an afterword by Werner Schr√∂der . Though the text is inferior to Ranke's, this is the only edition to provide full critical apparatus. * R. Bechstein (2 vols, Leipzig, 1870), re- issued in a revised version edited by Peter Ganz (2 vols, Brockhaus 1978), which includes Bechstein's running commentary and indicates differences from Ranke's text. Translations English translations: * Jessie L. Weston (London, 1899) * A.T. Hatto, with the Tristran of Thomas (London: Penguin, 1960). * E.H. Zeydel (Princeton, 1948) * William T. Whobrey, Tristan and Isolde, with Ulrich von T√ºrheim's Continuation (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2020). Modern German translations: * Xenja von Ertzdorff, Doris Scholz, Carola Voelkel (Fink, 1979) * Wolfgang Mohr (K√ºmmerle, 1979), in verse, based on Hermann Kurtz's translation * R√ºdiger Krohn (Reclam 1980) and * Dieter K√ºhn (Reclam, 1998) * Peter Knecht (de Gruyter, 2004) There are many older translations. However, any made before 1930, when Ranke's edition was first published, will be based on an outdated edition of the text.

She was the third ship named for Mobile, Alabama. She was laid down on 14 April 1941 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia; launched on 15 May 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Harry T. Hartwell; and commissioned on 24 March 1943, Captain Charles J. Wheeler in command. Service history =World War II= 1943 Following a Chesapeake Bay shakedown and a brief training cruise to Casco Bay, Mobile departed for the Pacific, arriving Pearl Harbor on 23 July 1943 for a month of further training. On 22 August, she sailed west, joining Task Force 15 (TF 15) the following day for a raid on Marcus Island on 31 August. She participated in two more carrier raids from Hawaii before joining the 5th Fleet for the Gilberts campaign. She screened the ships of TF 15 as they struck at Tarawa Atoll on 18 September, and the ships of TF 14 hitting Wake on 5‚Äì6 October. On 21 October, she sailed west again in Task Group 53.3 (TG 53.3). By 8 November, she was off Bougainville Island covering reinforcement landings. Thence she steamed to Espiritu Santo, where she joined TG 53.7 for the assault and occupation of Tarawa. From the landings at Betio on the 20th‚Äì28th, she remained in the area supporting the Marine assault forces as they fought the first vigorous beachhead opposition to an American amphibious landing. On 1 December, Mobile was reassigned to TF 50 (Fast Carrier Forces, Pacific Fleet), the nucleus of what was to become TF 38/58. From the Gilberts, this force moved north for air attacks on Kwajalein and Wotje in the Marshalls. From there, the force returned to Pearl Harbor. Mobile continued on to San Diego, where she arrived and reported for escort duty to Amphibious Forces, 5th Fleet on 29 December. 1944 Fifteen days later, sailing with TG 53.5, she began to make her way back to the Marshalls. Detached on 29 January 1944, Mobile, with other of Cruiser Division 13 (CruDiv 13), bombarded Wotje and then rejoined their task force for the assault and occupation of Kwajalein. Until 6 February, she performed fire support and carrier screening duties off Roi and Namur. She then proceeded to Majuro where, on 12 February, she joined TF 58. The mission of the fast carrier forces had by this time evolved into sealing off designated enemy-held atolls and islands which the Allies intended to take and interdicting others to isolate and keep to a minimum Japanese resistance at the target. Now a third mission was to be added, the pounding of major enemy bases without the aid of land-based aircraft, leaving little or no need for a return visit. Thus, to ease the occupation of Eniwetok and to aid in the encirclement of Rabaul, TF 58 departed Majuro and sailed for the Carolines. On 16‚Äì17 February, they devastated Truk, the best fleet anchorage in the Mandated Territories, the base of the Japanese combined fleet and the center for air and sea communications between Japan and the Bismarck Archipelago. The force then sailed northwest to the Mariana Islands for strikes on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, encountering heavy aerial resistance there on 21‚Äì22 February. After a brief respite for replenishment at Majuro, Mobile sailed to Espiritu Santo, where the ships of TG 58.1 were reorganized as TG 36.1 on 12 March. On 15 March, they steamed northwest to cover Marine forces as they landed on Emirau on 20 March. By 24 March, Mobiles first anniversary, she had steamed over and participated in 11 operations against the enemy. Three days later, her group once again became TG 58.1 and readied for further strikes on enemy installations. From 29 March to 3 April, they struck at the Palaus, Yap, and Woleai, returning to Majuro on 5 April. Next they supported Allied landings at Aitape, Humboldt Bay, and Tanah Merah Bay in New Guinea, and bombarded Wakde Airfield and Sawar Airfield on 21‚Äì22 April, to neutralize the danger of air attack on the Battle of Hollandia. From there, they returned to the Carolines where they conducted air strikes on Truk and bombarded Satawan on 29‚Äì30 April, hit Ponape on 1 May, and then headed back to Majuro to replenish and rearm in preparation for the Marianas campaign. On 6 June, the carrier force sortied from Majuro again. By 11 June, they were in the Marianas, striking at Saipan, Tinian, Guam, and Rota. From then through 17 June its planes and ships ranged from the Volcano and Bonin Islands to the southernmost Marianas supporting the assault on Saipan and preventing Japanese reinforcements from reaching that beleaguered island and the next target, Guam. On 18 June, searches for a Japanese fleet, reportedly en route from the Philippines, began to the west of the Marianas. The following day the Battle of the Philippine Sea opened with a Japanese carrier-based aircraft attack on the ships covering the Saipan assault. In the ensuing battle, Mobile continued her role as a guardian of the carriers, often dispatching her OS2U Kingfishers on antisubmarine and rescue missions, while planes from the carriers inflicted damage on Japanese aircraft strength and sank the aircraft carrier on 20 June, bringing the number of Japanese carriers lost to three, and having been sunk by the submarines and on 19 June. Retiring from the area on 23 June, the carrier force proceeded to Pagan Island, against which strikes were launched on 24 June, and then made for Eniwetok. Thence, on 30 June, they departed for further strikes on the Bonin and Volcano Islands on 4 July, before turning south once again to continue coverage of the Marianas campaign. Commencing daily strikes on Guam and Rota 6 July, the force remained in the area until after the landings on Guam. On 23 July, TG 58.1, with Mobile in the inner protective ring, steamed southwest for raids in the Western Carolines. Three days later they pounded Yap, Ulithi, and Fais, while TGs 58.2 and 58.3 hit the Palaus. On 30 July, TF 58 retired to Saipan, arrivingon 2 August. Underway again the same day, they headed back to the Bonin and Volcano Islands. As carrier planes bombed enemy installations on Iwo, Chichi, Ani, and Haha Jimas on 4 August, Mobile was detached with CruDiv 13 and Destroyer Division 46 (DesDiv 46)) to make an anti-shipping sweep in the Chichi Jima area. In the ensuing hours Mobile assisted in the sinking of one destroyer and a large cargo vessel. The following day she participated in the bombardment of Chichi Jima, and then set course for Eniwetok. Mobiles fast carrier group, now designated TG 38.3, began with strikes on the Palaus from 6 to 8 September, then sailed west, raiding Mindanao on 9‚Äì10 September, and the Visayas, on 12‚Äì13 September. On 15 September, the group returned to the Palaus to cover the landings on Peleliu and Angaur. By 18 September the ships of TG 38.3 were headed back to the Philippines. On 21 September, the force's planes struck the Manila area, and on 24 September swept the Visayas again. The force sortied from Ulithi once again on 6 October to pave the way for the upcoming Philippine operations. After the carrier planes had struck enemy installations in the Ry≈´ky≈´s, Mobile was detached with the destroyers and to search for and destroy two enemy ships distant from the force. Reaching the area, they discovered only one large cargo ship, the other vessel having been disposed of by several of the carrier planes. The three men-of-war quickly sank the cargo ship and rejoined TF 38 for strikes on Formosa and the Pescadores. On 13 October, Mobile was again detached and with others of her division formed a screen around the cruisers and , wryly designated \\"Cripple Division 1\\" (CripDiv 1). Mobile and her companions, playing up erroneous reports issued by the Japanese as to the degree of damage inflicted on \\"the defeated and fleeing\\" American force, hoped to draw out the Japanese in chase, so that the carrier task force could destroy them. With the discovery of the waiting American force by Japanese scout planes, orders were changed. Canberra and Houston were towed eastward for repairs and Mobile rejoined TG 38.3 on 17 October. The next day the force cruised to the east of the northern Philippines and on 20 October guarded the northern air approaches to Leyte as American forces streamed ashore. For the next few days, strikes were conducted throughout the Visayas and on southern Luzon. On 24 October, TG 38.3 was attacked by planes from Vice Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa's Mobile Fleet as they stood by the aircraft carrier . As the Battle for Leyte Gulf raged over the Philippines, TF 38.3 fought in the Battle off Cape Enga√±o on 25 October, then pursued the Mobile Fleet back toward Japan. Assigned to search for and destroy crippled enemy vessels and their escorts, Mobile aided in sinking and , then turned south to rejoin the main body of TF 38. For the next two months, the cruiser continued to operate in support of the Philippine campaign, guarding the carriers as they sent their planes to cover Allied assault forces in the Visayas and on Mindoro. On 26 December, she departed Ulithi for the west coast, arriving 16 days later at Terminal Island California, for overhaul and alterations. 1945 Back at Ulithi on 29 March, she was dispatched to join Task Force 54 (TF 54) in the invasion of Okinawa, arriving at Okinawa arriving on 3 April, two days after the initial assault landings. For the next two months, she provided fire support, served on antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols and saw duty as a unit of \\"flycatcher\\" groups assigned to detect and destroy Shinyo suicide boats before they caused any damage. At the end of May, she was reassigned to Leyte to join TG 95.7, Philippine training group, with which she operated for the remainder of the war. =Post-War= On 20 August, she cleared San Pedro Bay and headed north toward Okinawa and Japan for duty supporting the occupation. In September, she conducted several cruises between Japan and Okinawa, transporting liberated prisoners of wars on the first leg of their return to the United States. The following month she cruised in the Sasebo area and on 18 November, with Marine Corps and Navy men embarked, she departed for San Diego. Arriving on 2 December, she conducted another \\"Magic Carpet\\" run before steaming to Puget Sound for inactivation. Decommissioned on 9 May 1947, she entered the Reserve Fleet at Bremerton and remained there, in reserve, until 1 March 1959 when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sold for scrapping to Zidell Explorations, Inc., on 16 December 1959, and was towed away for scrapping on 19 January 1960. Awards Mobile received 11 battle stars for her World War II service.

She is also the patron saint of breast cancer patients, martyrs, wet nurses, bell-founders, bakers, and invoked against fire, earthquakes, and eruptions of Mount Etna. Early history Agatha is buried at the Badia di Sant'Agata, Catania.D'Arrigo 1985, p. 15; the present rebuilding of the ancient foundation is by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini (1767). She is listed in the late 6th-century Martyrologium Hieronymianum associated with Jerome, and the Synaxarion, the calendar of the church of Carthage, ca. 530.W.H. Frere, Studies in Roman Liturgy: 1. The Kalendar (London, 1930), p 94f. Agatha also appears in one of the carmina of Venantius Fortunatus.Carmen VIII, 4, De Virginitate, noted by Liana De Girolami Cheney, \\"The Cult of Saint Agatha\\" Woman's Art Journal 17.1 (Spring ‚Äì Summer 1996:3‚Äì9) p. 3. Two early churches were dedicated to her in Rome,Sant'Agata in via della Lugaretta, Trastevere, and Sant'Agata dei Goti, (Touring Club Italiano, Roma e dintorni [Milan, 1965], pp 444, 315). notably the Church of Sant'Agata dei Goti in Via Mazzarino, a titular church with apse mosaics of ca. 460 and traces of a fresco cycle,(date in TCI, Roma e dintorni; a letter from Pope Hadrian I (died 795) to Charlemagne remarks that Gregory (died 604) ordered the church adorned with mosaics and frescoes (Cheney 1996 note 5). overpainted by Gismondo Cerrini in 1630. In the 6th century AD, the church was adapted to Arianism, hence its name \\"Saint Agatha of Goths\\", and later reconsecrated by Gregory the Great, who confirmed her traditional sainthood. Agatha is also depicted in the mosaics of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, where she appears, richly dressed, in the procession of female martyrs along the north wall. Her image forms an initial I in the Sacramentary of Gellone, which dates from the end of the 8th century. Life One of the most highly venerated virgin martyrs of Christian antiquity, Agatha was put to death during the persecution of Decius (250‚Äì253) in Catania, Sicily, for her determined profession of faith.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"St. Agatha.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Agatha in front of the judge as depicted in a stained glass window from 1515 in Notre-Dame, Saint-L√¥ According to the 13th-century Golden Legend (III.15) by Jacobus de Voragine, fifteen-year-old Agatha, from a rich and noble family, made a vow of virginity and rejected the amorous advances of the Roman prefect Quintianus, who thought he could force her to turn away from her vow and marry him. His persistent proposals were consistently spurned by Agatha. This was during the persecutions of Decius, so Quintianus, knowing she was a Christian, reported her to the authorities. Quintianus himself was governor of the district.\\"Agatha of Sicily\\", Saints Resource, RCL Benziger He expected her to give in to his demands when she was faced with torture and possible death, but she simply reaffirmed her belief in God by praying: \\"Jesus Christ, Lord of all, you see my heart, you know my desires. Possess all that I am. I am your sheep: make me worthy to overcome the devil.\\" With tears falling from her eyes, she prayed for courage. To force her to change her mind, Quintianus sent Agatha to Aphrodisia, the keeper of a brothel, and had her imprisoned there. Agatha never lost her confidence in God. Quintianus sent for her again, argued, threatened, and finally had her imprisoned and tortured. She was stretched on a rack to be torn with iron hooks, burned with torches, and whipped. Amongst the tortures she underwent was the cutting off of her breasts with pincers. After further dramatic confrontations with Quintianus, represented in a sequence of dialogues in her passio that document her fortitude and steadfast devotion, Agatha was then sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but an earthquake saved her from that fate; instead, she was sent to prison where St. Peter the Apostle appeared to her and healed her wounds.Stracke, J. R., \\"Saint Agatha of Sicily\\", Georgia Regents University, Augusta Georgia Agatha died in prison, probably in the year 251 according to the Legenda Aurea. Although the martyrdom of Agatha is authenticated, and her veneration as a saint had spread beyond her native place even in antiquity, there is no reliable information concerning the details of her death. Osbern Bokenam, A Legend of Holy Women, written in the 1440s, offers some further detail.Osbern Bokenham, (Sheila Delany, tr.) A Legend of Holy Women (University of Notre Dame) 1992, pp. 157‚Äì167. Veneration According to Maltese tradition, during the persecution of Roman Emperor Decius (AD 249‚Äì251), Agatha, together with some of her friends, fled from Sicily and took refuge in Malta. Some historians believe that her stay on the island was rather short, and she spent her days in a rock-hewn crypt at Rabat, praying and teaching the Christian Faith to children. After some time, Agatha returned to Sicily, where she faced martyrdom. Agatha was arrested and brought before Quintanus, praetor of Catania, who condemned her to torture and imprisonment. The crypt of St. Agatha is an underground basilica, which from early ages was venerated by the Maltese. At the time of St. Agatha's stay, the crypt was a small natural cave which later on, during the 4th or 5th century, was enlarged and embellished. After the Reformation era, Agatha was retained in the calendar of the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer with her feast on 5 February. Several Church of England parish churches are dedicated to her. =Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania= The Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania is a major festival in the region, it takes place in the first five days of February. The Catania Cathedral (also known as Cattedrale di Sant'Agata) is dedicated to the saint.

She is also considered to be a powerful intercessor when people suffer from fires. Her feast day is celebrated on February 5. She is also a patron saint of Malta, where in 1551 her intercession through a reported apparition to a Benedictine nun is said to have saved Malta from Turkish invasion.\\"St. Agatha\\", St. Agatha's Crypt, Catacombs & Museum She became the patron saint of the Republic of San Marino after Pope Clement XII restored the independence of the state on her feast day of February 5, 1740.Nevio and Annio Maria Matteimi The Republic of San Marino: Historical and Artistic Guide to the City and the Castles, 2011, p. 23. She is also the patron saint of Catania, Sorihuela del Guadalimar (Spain), Molise, San Marino and Kalsa, a historical quarter of Palermo. She is claimed as the patroness of Palermo. The year after her death, the stilling of an eruption of Mount Etna was attributed to her intercession. As a result, apparently, people continued to ask her prayers for protection against fire.Foley O.F.M., Leonard. Saint of the Day, (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media In Switzerland Agatha is considered the patron saint of fire services. Iconography Minne di Sant'Agata, a typical Sicilian sweet shaped as a breast, representing the cut breasts of Saint Agatha Saint Agatha is often depicted iconographically carrying her excised breasts on a platter, as in Bernardino Luini's Saint Agatha (1510‚Äì1515) in the Galleria Borghese, Rome, in which Agatha contemplates the breasts on a standing salver held in her hand. The tradition of Agatha Buns, Agatha bread, or so-called St Agatha's Breasts or Minne di Sant'Agata (Italian/Sicilian for Breasts of St. Agatha) or Minni di Virgini (Italian/Sicilian for Breasts of (a) virgin), served or blessed on her feast day, is found in many countries.

Homeowners can choose to hear a song about her life, accompanied by the beats of their walking sticks on the floor or a prayer for the household's deceased. After that, the homeowner donates food to the chorus.J. Etxegoien, Orhipean, Gure Herria ezagutzen (Xamar) 1996 [in Basque]. This song has varying lyrics according to the local tradition and the Basque language. An exceptional case was that of 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, when a version appeared that in the Spanish language praised the Soviet ship Komsomol, which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the Second Spanish Republic. An annual festival to commemorate the life of Saint Agatha takes place in Catania, Sicily, from February 3 to 5. The festival culminates in an all-night procession through the city.\\"Feast of Saint Agatha in Catania, Sicily\\", Italy magazine, February 2, 2009 St. Agatha's Tower is a former Knight's stronghold located in the north west of Malta.

After being selected as part of the first group of astronauts to include women, she flew on three Space Shuttle flights: as mission specialist for STS-51-D and STS-40, and as payload commander for STS-58. Both before and after her career in the astronaut program, she has been active in the medical community in Tennessee, Mississippi and Texas. Early life and education Seddon was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where she attended St Rose of Lima Catholic School and graduated from Central High School in 1965. She received a bachelor of arts degree in physiology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1970, and a doctorate of medicine from the University of Tennessee College of Medicine in 1973. While at the University of California, Seddon was a member of Sigma Kappa sorority. After medical school, Seddon completed a surgical internship and three years of a general surgery residency in Memphis with a particular interest in nutrition in surgery patients. Between the period of her internship and residency, she served as an Emergency Department physician at a number of hospitals in Mississippi and Tennessee, and served in this capacity in the Houston area in her spare time. Seddon has also performed clinical research into the effects of radiation therapy on nutrition in cancer patients. NASA experience Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, Seddon became an astronaut in August 1979. Her work at NASA was in a variety of areas, including Orbiter and payload software, Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory, Flight Data File, Shuttle medical kit and checklist, launch and landing rescue helicopter physician, support crew member for STS-6, crew equipment, membership on NASA's Aerospace Medical Advisory Committee, Technical Assistant to the Director of Flight Crew Operations, and Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center. She was Assistant to the Director of Flight Crew Operations for Shuttle/Mir Payloads. A three- flight veteran with over 722 hours in space, Seddon was a mission specialist on STS-51D (1985) and STS-40 (1991), and was the payload commander on STS-58 (1993). In September 1996, she was detailed by NASA to Vanderbilt University Medical School in Nashville, Tennessee. She assisted in the preparation of cardiovascular experiments that flew aboard on the Neurolab Spacelab flight in April 1998. Seddon retired from NASA in November 1997. She is now the assistant Chief Medical Officer of the Vanderbilt Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee. =Space flights= Portrait from 1978 STS-51-D (), April 12‚Äì19, 1985, was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The crew deployed ANIK-C for Telesat of Canada, and Syncom IV-3 for the U.S. Navy. A malfunction in the Syncom spacecraft resulted in the first unscheduled spacewalk, rendezvous and proximity operations for the Space Shuttle in an attempt to activate the satellite using the Remote Manipulator System. Seddon logged 168 hours in 109 Earth orbits and used her surgical skills to operate a bone saw to help build homemade repair tools for the satellite. STS-40 () Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS-1), June 5‚Äì14, 1991, a dedicated space and life sciences mission was launched from the Kennedy Space Center and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base. During the nine-day mission the crew performed experiments which explored how humans, animals and cells respond to microgravity and re-adapt to Earth's gravity on return. Other payloads included experiments designed to investigate materials science, plant biology and cosmic radiation, and tests of hardware proposed for the Space Station Freedom Health Maintenance Facility. Mission completed in 146 orbits of the Earth, and logged her an additional 218 hours in space. STS-58 (), Spacelab Life Sciences-2 (SLS-2), flew October 18 to November 1, 1993. Seddon was the Payload Commander on this life science research mission which received NASA management recognition as the most successful and efficient Spacelab flown to date. During the fourteen-day flight the seven-person crew performed neurovestibular, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and musculoskeletal medical experiments on themselves and 48 rats, expanding our knowledge of human and animal physiology both on earth and in space flight. In addition, the crew performed ten engineering tests aboard the Orbiter Columbia and nine Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project experiments. The mission was accomplished in 225 orbits of the Earth in over 336 hours. Personal life She is married to former astronaut Robert L. Gibson of Cooperstown, New York, with whom she has three children. Awards and honors In 2015, Seddon was inducted into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.

Hoffman made five flights as a Space Shuttle astronaut, including the first mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993, when the orbiting telescope's flawed optical system was corrected. Trained as an astrophysicist, he also flew on the 1990 Spacelab Shuttle mission that featured the Astro-1 ultraviolet astronomical observatory in the Shuttle's payload bay. Over the course of his five missions he logged more than 1,211 hours and 21.5 million miles in space. He was also NASA's first Jewish astronaut, the first Jewish male astronaut in space, and the second Jewish man in space after Soviet cosmonaut Boris Volynov. Background Hoffman was born November 2, 1944, in Brooklyn, New York, but considers Scarsdale, New York, to be his hometown. He graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1962, received a BA degree (summa cum laude) in astronomy from Amherst College in 1966,[ https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/physics/alumni/astronomy- alumni-directory?page=0%2C1 Astronomy Alumni] - website of Amherst College a PhD degree in astrophysics from Harvard University in 1971,Astronomy Alumni: PhD Recipients and Advisors - website of the Harvard University and an MSc degree in materials science from Rice University in 1988.Jeffrey Hoffman '88 Inducted into Jewish American Hall of Fame - alumni website of Rice University Hoffman is an Eagle Scout. Hoffman is a member of the International Academy of Astronautics, the International Astronomical Union, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Astronomical Society, the Spanish Academy of Engineering, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi. he is currently co- director of the Massachusetts Space Grant Consortium and a Professor of the Practice in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. Academic experience Hoffman's original research interests were in high-energy astrophysics, specifically cosmic gamma ray and x-ray astronomy. His doctoral work at Harvard was the design, construction, testing, and flight of a balloon-borne, low-energy, gamma ray telescope. From 1972 to 1975, during post-doctoral work at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, he worked on several x-ray astronomy rocket payloads. He also designed and supervised the construction and testing of the test equipment for use in an x-ray beam facility which he used to measure the scattering and reflectivity properties of x-ray concentrating mirrors. During his last year at Leicester, he was project scientist for the medium-energy x-ray experiment on the European Space Agency's EXOSAT satellite and played a leading role in the proposal and design studies for this project. He worked in the Center for Space Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1975 to 1978 as project scientist in charge of the orbiting HEAO-1 A4 hard x-ray and gamma ray experiment, launched in August 1977. His involvement included pre- launch design of the data analysis system, supervising its operation post- launch, and directing the MIT team undertaking the scientific analysis of flight data being returned. He was also involved extensively in analysis of x-ray data from the SAS-3 satellite being operated by MIT. His principal research was the study of x-ray bursts, about which he authored or co-authored more than 20 papers. He joined the MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics faculty in 2001 as a senior lecturer, and since 2002 has been a Professor of the Practice in that department. His research specialties include human space flight operations, space flight technology, human-machine interactions, extravehicular activity, and conducting laboratory research in space. His teaching interests include space systems design and space policy. Dr. Hoffman instructed a course in systems engineering on the space shuttle that is available for free in video format from academic earth. NASA experience Selected by NASA in January 1978, Hoffman became an astronaut in August 1979. During preparations for the Shuttle Orbital Flight Tests, he worked in the Flight Simulation Laboratory at Downey, California, testing guidance, navigation and flight control systems. He worked with the orbital maneuvering and reaction control systems, with Shuttle navigation, with crew training, and with the development of satellite deployment procedures. Hoffman served as a support crewmember for STS-5 and as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for the STS-8 and STS-82 missions. He also worked on EVA, including the development of a high-pressure spacesuit, and preparations for the assembly of the Space Station. Hoffman was a co-founder of the Astronaut Office Science Support Group. In 1996 he led the Payload and Habitability Branch of the Astronaut Office. Among the Jewish items he took into space were a Dreidel, which he spun for an hour, a Mezuzah, which he attached to the space station bunk bed he and fellow Jewish astronaut Scott J. Horowitz alternately used, and a Chanukah menorah. Hoffman left the astronaut program in July 1997 to become NASA's European Representative in Paris, where he served until August 2001. His principal duties were to keep NASA and NASA's European partners informed about each other's activities, try to resolve problems in US-European cooperative space projects, search for new areas of US-European space cooperation, and represent NASA in European media. In August 2001, Hoffman was seconded by NASA to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is a Professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He is engaged in several research projects using the International Space Station and teaches courses on space operations and design.

On this mission, he made the first STS contingency spacewalk, in an attempted rescue of a malfunctioning satellite. Hoffman made his second space flight as a mission specialist on STS-35, December 2‚Äì10, 1990, on the Space Shuttle Columbia. This Spacelab mission featured the ASTRO-1 ultraviolet astronomy laboratory, a project on which Hoffman had worked since 1982. Hoffman made his third space flight as payload commander and mission specialist on STS-46, July 31-August 8, 1992, on the Space Shuttle Atlantis. On this mission, the crew deployed the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA), an ESA-sponsored free-flying science platform, and carried out the first test flight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS), a joint project between NASA and the Italian Space Agency. Hoffman had worked on the Tethered Satellite project since 1987. Hoffman made his fourth flight as an EVA crewmember on STS-61, December 2‚Äì13, 1993, on the Space Shuttle Endeavour. During this flight, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was captured, serviced, and restored to full capacity through a record five spacewalks by four astronauts, including Hoffman. Hoffman also spun a dreidel for the holiday of Chanukah to a live audience watching via satellite. Hoffman last flew on STS-75 (February 22 - March 9, 1996) on the Space Shuttle Columbia. This was a 16-day mission whose principal payloads were the reflight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) and the third flight of the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-3). The TSS successfully demonstrated the ability of tethers to produce electricity. The TSS experiment produced a wealth of new information on the electrodynamics of tethers and plasma physics before the tether broke at 19.7 km, just shy of the 20.7 km goal. The crew also worked around the clock performing combustion experiments and research related to USMP-3 microgravity investigations. During this mission, Hoffman became the first astronaut to log 1000 hours aboard the Space Shuttle. With the completion of his fifth space flight, Dr. Hoffman has logged more than 1,211 hours and 21.5 million miles in space. Since 2002, he has been a Professor of the Practice in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since 2008 he has also been a visiting Professor at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester. He is the author of a book titled An Astronaut's Diary (June 1986) which is accompanied by a cassette tape. The audio tape contains excerpts of the original recordings he made with a pocket tape recorder.

While still a student at the Roman College, he died as a result of caring for the victims of a serious epidemic. He was beatified in 1605 and canonized in 1726. Early life Gonzaga was born the eldest of seven children, at his family's castle in Castiglione delle Stiviere, between Brescia and Mantua in northern Italy in what was then part of the Duchy of Mantua, into the illustrious House of Gonzaga. \\"Aloysius\\" is the Latin form of Aloysius de Gonzaga's given name in Italian, Luigi. He was the son of Ferrante de Gonzaga (1544‚Äì1586), Marquis of Castiglione, and Marta Tana di Santena, daughter of a baron of the Piedmontese Della Rovere family. His mother was a lady-in-waiting to Isabel, the wife of Philip II of Spain. As the first-born son, he was in line to inherit his father's title and status of Marquis. His father assumed that Aloysius would become a soldier, as that was the norm for sons of the aristocracy and the family was often involved in the minor wars of the period. His military training started at an early age, but he also received an education in languages and the arts. As early as age four, Luigi was given a set of miniature guns and accompanied his father on training expeditions so that the boy might learn \\"the art of arms\\". At age five, Aloysius was sent to a military camp to get started on his training. His father was pleased to see his son marching around camp at the head of a platoon of soldiers. His mother and his tutor were less pleased with the vocabulary he picked up there. Aloysius de Gonzaga as a boy He grew up amid the violence and brutality of Renaissance Italy and witnessed the murder of two of his brothers. In 1576, at age 8, he was sent to Florence along with his younger brother, Rodolfo, to serve at the court of the Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici and to receive further education. While there, he fell ill with a disease of the kidneys, which troubled him throughout his life. While he was ill, he took the opportunity to read about the saints and to spend much of his time in prayer. He is said to have taken a private vow of chastity at age 9. In November 1579, the brothers were sent to the Duke of Mantua. Aloysius was shocked by the violent and frivolous lifestyle he encountered there. Aloysius returned to Castiglione where he met Cardinal Charles Borromeo, and from him received First Communion on 22 July 1580. After reading a book about Jesuit missionaries in India, Aloysius felt strongly that he wanted to become a missionary. He started practicing by teaching catechism classes to young boys in Castiglione in the summers. He also repeatedly visited the houses of the Capuchin friars and the Barnabites located in Casale Monferrato, the capital of the Gonzaga-ruled Duchy of Montferrat where the family spent the winter. He also adopted an ascetic lifestyle. The family was called to Spain in 1581 to assist the Holy Roman Empress Maria of Austria. They arrived in Madrid in March 1582, where Aloysius and Rodolfo became pages for the young Infante Diego. Aloysius started thinking in earnest about joining a religious order. He had considered joining the Capuchins, but he had a Jesuit confessor in Madrid and decided instead to join that order. His mother agreed to his request, but his father was furious and prevented him from doing so. In July 1584, a year and a half after the Infante's death, the family returned to Italy. Aloysius still wanted to become a priest, but several members of his family worked hard to persuade him to change his mind. When they realized there was no way to make him give up his plan, they tried to persuade him to become a secular priest and offered to arrange for a bishopric for him. If he were to become a Jesuit he would renounce any right to his inheritance or status in society. His family's attempts to dissuade him failed; Aloysius was not interested in higher office and still wanted to become a missionary. Religious life In November 1585, Aloysius gave up all rights of inheritance, which was confirmed by the emperor. He went to Rome and, because of his noble birth, gained an audience with Pope Sixtus V. Following a brief stay at the Palazzo Aragona Gonzaga, the Roman home of his cousin, Cardinal Scipione Gonzaga, on 25 November 1585 he was accepted into the Society of Jesus in Rome. During this period, he was asked to moderate his asceticism somewhat and to be more social with the other novices. Aloysius' health continued to cause problems. In addition to the kidney disease, he also suffered from a skin disease, chronic headaches and insomnia. He was sent to Milan for studies, but after some time he was sent back to Rome because of his health. On 25 November 1587, he took the three religious vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. In February and March 1588, he received minor orders and started studying theology to prepare for ordination. In 1589, he was called to Mantua to mediate between his brother Rodolfo and the Duke of Mantua. He returned to Rome in May 1590. It is said that, later that year, he had a vision in which the Archangel Gabriel told him that he would die within a year. Statue of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, St. Joseph's Church, Macao In 1591, a plague broke out in Rome. The Jesuits opened a hospital for the stricken, and Aloysius volunteered to work there. After begging alms for the victims, Aloysius began working with the sick, carrying the dying from the streets into a hospital founded by the Jesuits. There he washed and fed the plague victims, preparing them as best he could to receive the sacraments. But though he threw himself into his tasks, he privately confessed to his spiritual director, Fr. Robert Bellarmine, that his constitution was revolted by the sights and smells of the work; he had to work hard to overcome his physical repulsion. At the time, many of the younger Jesuits had become infected with the disease, and so Aloysius's superiors forbade him from returning to the hospital. But Aloysius‚Äîlong accustomed to refusals from his father‚Äîpersisted and requested permission to return, which was granted. Eventually he was allowed to care for the sick, but only at another hospital, called Our Lady of Consolation, where those with contagious diseases were not admitted. While there, Aloysius lifted a man out of his sickbed, tended to him, and brought him back to his bed. But the man was infected with the plague. Aloysius grew ill and was bedridden by 3 March 1591, a few days before his 23rd birthday. Aloysius rallied for a time, but as fever and a cough set in, he declined for many weeks. It seemed certain that he would die in a short time, and he was given Extreme Unction. While he was ill, he spoke several times with his confessor, the cardinal and later saint, Robert Bellarmine. Aloysius had another vision and told several people that he would die on the Octave of the feast of Corpus Christi. On that day, 21 June 1591, he seemed very well in the morning, but insisted that he would die before the day was over. As he began to grow weak, Bellarmine gave him the last rites and recited the prayers for the dying. He died just before midnight. As Fr. Tylenda tells the story, \\"When the two Jesuits came to his side, they noticed a change in his face and realized that their young Aloysius was dying. His eyes were fixed on the crucifix he held in his hands, and as he tried to pronounce the name of Jesus he died.\\" Painting of Aloysius Gonzaga in Marmoutier Abbey, Alsace, France Purity was his notable virtue. The Carmelite mystic St. Maria Magdalena de Pazzi claimed to have had a vision of him on 4 April 1600. She described him as radiant in glory because of his \\"interior works,\\" a hidden martyr for his great love of God. Veneration Saint Aloysius Gonzaga in Glory by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, incomplete provenance Aloysius was buried in the Church of the Most Holy Annunciation, which later became the church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola (Sant'Ignazio) in Rome. His name was changed to \\"Robert\\" before his death, in honor of his confessor. Many people considered him to be a saint soon after his death, and his remains were moved into the Sant'Ignazio church, where they now rest in an urn of lapis lazuli in the Lancellotti Chapel. His head was later translated to the basilica bearing his name in Castiglione delle Stiviere. He was beatified only fourteen years after his death by Pope Paul V, on 19 October 1605. On 31 December 1726, he was canonized together with another Jesuit novice, Stanislaus Kostka, by Pope Benedict XIII. Patronage In 1729, Pope Benedict XIII declared Aloysius de Gonzaga to be the patron saint of young students. In 1926, he was named patron of all Christian youth by Pope Pius XI. Owing to the manner of his death, he has been considered a patron saint of plague victims. For his compassion and courage in the face of an incurable disease, Aloysius Gonzaga has become the patron both of AIDS sufferers and their caregivers. Aloysius is also the patron of Valmontone, a town in Lazio. Aloysius Gonzaga is also celebrated in a small south Italy town called Alezio, as a patron of the town, celebrated on June 21. Iconography In art, St Aloysius is shown as a young man wearing a black cassock and surplice, or as a page. His attributes are a lily, referring to innocence; a cross, referring to piety and sacrifice; a skull, referring to his early death; and a rosary, referring to his devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Legacy St. Aloysius Senior Secondary School, Jabalpur in India St. Aloysius Gonzaga Church on the campus of Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington Saint Aloysius' feast day is celebrated on 21 June, the date of his death. Several buildings and institutions in Spokane, Washington, are named after Gonzaga. Gonzaga University is a Roman Catholic university which also has St. Aloysius Gonzaga Church on its campus, which is overseen by the diocese of Spokane. Gonzaga Preparatory School is a private, Roman Catholic high school. Finally, St. Aloysius Gonzaga Catholic School is a K-8 school. In Washington, D.C., Gonzaga College High School: Washington Seminary, as Gonzaga was originally called, began classes for lay students in 1821 and was renamed Gonzaga College. Gonzaga College High School is a Catholic college preparatory school for boys in grades 9‚Äì12. St. Aloysius Gonzaga Church on the campus of Gonzaga High School in Washington, D.C., is used for graduation ceremonies of the high school. It had been an operating parish church until 2016. When the church was dedicated in 1859, The New York Times wrote, \\"In internal architectural beauty, it is said not to be surpassed by any church in the world.\\" Another St. Aloysius Gonzaga parish is located within the Archdiocese of Washington in Leonardtown, Maryland. Leonardtown is the seat of St. Mary‚Äôs County, where the first major Catholic settlement in the Thirteen Colonies was established in the 17th century by the Jesuit order. Gonzaga College is a Jesuit Secondary School for boys in Dublin, Ireland. St. Aloysius Senior Secondary Schools are established throughout India. St. Joseph in Gelsenkirchen, the location of German soccer club Schalke 04, has a glass window of the saint with a soccer ball and refers to the club colors and its strong fanbase. Not long after Aloysius' death, on his feast day in 1608, the three daughters of his brother, Rodolfo, established a community of women dedicated to education, under the formal name of the Noble Virgins of Jesus. This community still exists, although it is currently reduced to two members. In the work The Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Fr. John Croiset mentions St. Aloysius' devotion to the Sacred Heart.

In 1970, he resigned his regular United States Navy commission and affiliated with the Naval Air Reserve in which he achieved the rank of Rear Admiral. As a Naval Reservist, Griggs was assigned to several fighter and attack squadrons flying A-4 Skyhawk, A-7 Corsair II and F-8 Crusader aircraft based at Naval Air Stations in New Orleans, Louisiana and Miramar, California. He logged 9,500 hours flying time, 7,800 hours in jet aircraft, and flew over 45 different types of aircraft including single and multi engine prop, turboprop and jet aircraft, helicopters, gliders, hot air balloons and the Space Shuttle. He made over 300 aircraft carrier landings, held an Airline Transport Pilot License, and was a certified flight instructor. NASA career Waving to the orbiter during his 3-hour EVA aboard mission STS-51-D In July 1970, Griggs was employed at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center as a research pilot, working on various flight test and research projects in support of NASA programs. In 1974, he was assigned duties as the project pilot for the space shuttle trainer aircraft and participated in the design, development, and testing of those aircraft pending their operational deployment in 1976. He was appointed Chief of the Shuttle Training Aircraft Operations Office in January 1976 with responsibility for the operational use of the shuttle trainer, and held that position until being selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978. In August 1979, he completed a one-year training and evaluation period and became eligible for Space Shuttle flight crew assignment. From 1979 to 1983, Griggs was involved in several Space Shuttle engineering capacities including the development and testing of the Head-Up Display (HUD) approach and landing avionics system, development of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and the requirements definition and verification of on-orbit rendezvous and entry flight phase software and procedures. In September 1983 he began crew training as a mission specialist for flight STS-51-D, which flew April 12‚Äì19, 1985. During the flight, Mr. Griggs conducted the first unscheduled extravehicular activity (space walk) of the space program. The space walk lasted for over three hours during which preparations for a satellite rescue attempt were completed. At the time of his death, Griggs was in flight crew training as pilot for STS-33, a dedicated Department of Defense mission, scheduled for launch in November 1989.

Early life and scholarship Head was born at Wiarton Place, near Maidstone, Kent, the son of the Reverend Sir John Head, 7th Bt. and Jane (n√©e Walker) Head. He succeeded to his father's title in 1838. He was educated at Winchester College and Oriel College, Oxford, and in 1830 he was made a Fellow of Merton College. He was an Oxford scholar and tutor who published several books, including a book on the verbs shall and will. In 1866, Head published The Story of Viga Glum, which he had translated from the original Icelandic. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863. Government service In 1847, Head was appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick (1847‚Äì1854). While Lieutenant Governor, Head authorized the creation of an engineering faculty at the University of New Brunswick (UNB). This was the first such programme in what would become Canada. In 1854, Head was appointed Governor General of the Province of Canada.The Edinburgh Gazette, September 22, 1854, Numb. 6423, p. 813. He served until 1861. During his time in office, there was some controversy over his refusal to grant a dissolution to the Reform ministry at the time of the \\"Double Shuffle\\".David Mills, \\"Double Shuffle\\", Canadian Encyclopedia, July 7, 2015. He was appointed a Privy Councillor in 1857, and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1860. Head died in London in 1868. Family Lady Anna Maria Head (n√©e Yorke) He had married Anna Maria Yorke, daughter of Reverend Philip Yorke Prebendary of Ely, and his wife, Hon. Anna Maria Cocks, daughter of John Cocks, 1st Earl Somers, on 27 November 1838. Anna Maria was born in 1808. The couple had three children. Their son accidentally drowned in Quebec's Saint-Maurice River in September, 1859. One of their two daughters was born at Fredericton, New Brunswick on 6 February 1849. Anna Maria was an artist, who sketched a picture of the view from Major's Hill, Ottawa, Ontario which she subsequently presented to Queen Victoria. Within a month or two after this event Her Majesty chose Ottawa as the seat of Government of United Canada. Lady Head volunteered and bestowed alms among the poor. A memorial of her Ladyship's visit to the Upper Ottawa, in a bark canoe, in 1856, stands at Portage-du-Fort, Quebec. In the county of Renfrew, a township Maria, was named in her honour. Lady Head died at Oak Lea, Shere, Guildford, England, 25 August 1890.

Garn became the first sitting Member of Congress to fly in space when he flew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery as a payload specialist during NASA mission STS-51-D (April 12‚Äì19, 1985). Early life The son of a World War I pilot, Garn was born in born in Richfield, Utah. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business and finance from the University of Utah in 1955, and was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Garn also attended East High School, Clayton Middle School, and Uintah Elementary School. Career Senator Garn is a former insurance executive. He served in the United States Navy as a Martin P5M Marlin pilot. He also served as a pilot of the 151st Air Refueling Group of the Utah Air National Guard, where he flew the Boeing KC-97L and KC-135A. He retired as a Colonel in April 1979. He was promoted to Brigadier General after his space shuttle mission. He had flown 17,000 hours in military aircraft when he flew in space. Prior to his election to the Senate, Garn served on the Salt Lake City commission for four years and was elected as the mayor in 1971, entering office in 1972. He was the last Republican to hold that office to date. Garn was active in the Utah League of Cities and Towns and served as its president in 1972. In 1974, Garn was the first vice-president of the National League of Cities, and he served as its honorary president in 1975. Garn was first elected to the Senate in 1974, succeeding retiring Republican Wallace Bennett, father of later Senator Robert Bennett. Garn was re-elected to a second term in November 1980 with 74 percent of the vote, the largest victory in a statewide race in Utah history. Garn was re-elected a second time in 1986. Though strongly pro-life on the issue of abortion, Garn joined U.S. Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois in resigning from the board of the United States Pro-Life Political Action Committee when the executive director of the organization, Peter Gemma, issued a \\"hit list\\" to target certain lawmakers who supported abortion. Garn and Hyde, the author of the Hyde Amendment, which limited abortions financed by Medicaid, said that \\"hit lists\\" are counterproductive because they create irrevocable discord among legislators, any of whom can be subject to a \\"single issue\\" attack of this kind by one interest group or another. Gemma said that he was surprised by the withdrawal of Garn and Hyde from the PAC committee but continued with plans to spend $650,000 for the 1982 elections on behalf of anti-abortion candidates. Garn was chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and served on three subcommittees: Housing and Urban Affairs, Financial Institutions, and International Finance and Monetary Policy. He also was a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and served as Chairman of the HUD-Independent Agencies Subcommittee. He served on four other Appropriations subcommittees: Energy and Water Resources, Defense, Military Construction, and Interior. Garn served as a member of the Republican leadership from 1979 to 1984 as Secretary of the Republican Conference. His Institute of Finance has been called a \\"hot tub of influence peddling.\\" Garn retired from the Senate in 1992. Savings and loan As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Garn was co-author of the Garn‚ÄìSt. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the law that partially deregulated the savings and loan industry and attempted to forestall the looming Savings and Loan crisis. Spaceflight Garn asked to fly on the Space Shuttle because he was head of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that dealt with NASA, and had extensive aviation experience. He had previously flown a B-2 Spirit prototype and driven a new Army tank. He began publicly asking NASA about flying on the shuttle in 1981, and the agency had long planned to fly \\"citizen passengers\\" like artists, journalists, entertainers, and the Teacher in Space Project, but the November 1984 announcement that a member of Congress would go to space surprised most observers. Garn said that flying on the shuttle would be a fact-finding trip: \\"I do really think that it is a necessity that Congressmen check things out that they vote for and make certain that funds are being spent adequately. It might be necessary to have a Senator kick the tire\\". STS-51-D was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Its primary objective was to deploy two communications satellites, and to perform electrophoresis and echocardiograph operations in space in addition to a number of other experiments. As a payload specialist, Garn's role on the mission was as a congressional observer and as a subject for medical experiments on space motion sickness. At the conclusion of the mission, Garn had traveled over in 108 Earth orbits, logging over 167 hours in space. The space sickness Garn experienced during the journey was so severe that a scale for space sickness was jokingly based on him, where \\"one Garn\\" is the highest possible level of sickness. Some NASA astronauts who opposed the payload specialist program, such as Mike Mullane, believed that Garn's space sickness was evidence of the inappropriateness of flying people with little training. Garn was in excellent physical condition, however, and began flying at the age of 16. Astronaut Charles F. Bolden described Garn as \\"the ideal candidate to do it, because he was a veteran Navy combat pilot who had more flight hours than anyone in the Astronaut Office\\". Fellow 51-D payload specialist Charles D. Walker‚Äîwho also suffered from space sickness on the flight despite having flown before‚Äîstated that The Jake Garn Mission Simulator and Training Facility, NASA's prime training facility for astronauts in the Shuttle and Space Station programs, is named after him. Upon his return, he co-authored a novel entitled Night Launch. The book centers around terrorists taking control of the Space Shuttle Discovery during the first NASA‚ÄìUSSR space shuttle flight. It was published in 1989. Personal life Garn married Hazel Rhae Thompson in 1957.\\"Edwin Jacob Garn.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2001. Gale Biography In Context.

Karl Leberecht Immermann (24 April 1796 ‚Äì 25 August 1840) was a German dramatist, novelist and a poet. He was born at Magdeburg, the son of a government official. In 1813 he went to study law at Halle, where he remained, after the suppression of the university by Napoleon in the same year, until Frederick William III of Prussia's \\"Summons to my people\\" on 17 March. Immermann responded quickly, but was prevented by illness from taking part in the earlier campaign; he fought, however, in 1815 at Ligny and Waterloo, and marched into Paris with Bl√ºcher. At the conclusion of the war he resumed his studies at Halle, and after being Referendar in Magdeburg, was appointed in 1819 Assessor at M√ºnster in Westphalia. Here he made the acquaintance of Elise von L√ºtzow, Countess von Ahlefeldt, wife of Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm Freiherr von L√ºtzow. She inspired him to begin writing, and their relationship is reflected in several dramas written about this time. In 1823 Immermann was appointed judge at Magdeburg, and in 1827 was transferred to D√ºsseldorf as Landgerichtsrat or district judge. The countess, whose marriage had in the meantime been dissolved, followed him, and, though refusing marriage, shared his home until 1839, when he married a granddaughter of August Hermann Niemeyer (1754-1828), chancellor and rector perpetuus of Halle University. In 1834 Immermann undertook the management of the D√ºsseldorf theatre, and, although his resources were small, succeeded for two years in raising it to a high level of excellence. The theatre, however, was insufficiently endowed to allow of him carrying on the work, and In 1836 he returned to his official duties and literary pursuits. He died at D√ºsseldorf. Immermann had considerable aptitude for the drama, but it was long before he found a congenial field for his talents. His early plays are imitations, partly of Kotzebue's, partly of the Romantic dramas of Ludwig Tieck and M√ºller, and are now forgotten. In 1826, however, appeared Cardenio und Celinde, a love tragedy of more promise; this, as well as the earlier productions, awakened the ill-will of Count Platen, who made Immermann the subject of his wittiest satire, Der romantische Oedipus. Between 1827 and 1832 Immermann redeemed his good name by a series of historical tragedies, Das Trauerspiel in Tirol (1827), Kaiser Friedrich II. (1828) and a trilogy from Russian history, Alexis (1832). His masterpiece is the poetic mystery, Merlin (1831), a noble poem, which, like its model, Faust, deals with the deeper problems of modern spiritual life. Immermann's important dramaturgic experiments in D√ºsseldorf are described in detail in D√ºsseldorfer Anf√§nge (1840). More significant is his position as a novelist. Here he clearly stands on the boundary line between Romanticism and modern literature; his Epigonen (1836) might be described as one of the last Romantic imitations of Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, while the satire and realism of his second novel, M√ºnchhausen (1838), form a complete break with the older literature. As a prose-writer Immermann is perhaps best remembered to-day by the admirable story of village life, Der Oberhof, which is embedded in the formless mass of M√ºnchhausen. His last work was an unfinished epic, Tristan und Isolde (1840). Immermann's Gesammelte Schriften were published in 14 vols. in 1835-1843; a new edition, with biography and introduction by R Boxberger, in 20 vols. (Berlin, 1883); selected works, edited by M Koch, (4 vols, 1887-1888) and Franz Muncker (6 vols, 1897).

He was mayor of Glace Bay from 1913 to 1915 when he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force fighting in World War I. He was elected a Conservative MLA in 1925 representing Cape Breton Centre and his support from miners helped ensure the Conservative Party's victory in that election. Harrington became Minister of Labour in the government of Edgar N. Rhodes and became Premier of Nova Scotia when Rhodes left provincial politics to enter the federal cabinet in 1930. During Harrington's term he was able to end ongoing labour disturbance among miners in Cape Breton which had afflicted the previous two premiers. He improved the provincial department of mining, fought for the coal and steel industries in Ottawa, and passed legislation calling for a national policy on coal and steel. However, his government was unable to combat the Great Depression and was defeated by the Liberals in the 1933 election. Harrington remained in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly until 1937. His government was the last Conservative government until Robert Stanfield was able to take power in 1956.

It was disputed between England and France during parts of the Hundred Years' War. Aumale in Norman nobility Aumale was a medieval fief in the Duchy of Normandy and, after 1066, of the King of England. According to Chisholm, the fief of Aumale was granted by the archbishop of Rouen to Odo, brother-in-law of William the Conqueror, who erected it into a countship. However Thompson tells us Aumale was given to Adelaide, William's half-sister, as a dower by her first husband Enguerrand; it then passed jure uxoris to her second and third husbands, Lambert and Odo.Kathleen Thompson, 'Being the Ducal Sister: The Role of Adelaide of Aumale', Normandy and its Neighbours 900‚Äì1250; Essays for David Bates, ed.

In 1087 Odo received the Lordship of Holderness, and at some time before 1090 Adelaide's holdings were passed to their son, Stephen. In 1102 the fief, with Odo's lands in Holderness, passed to their son, Stephen. =Lords of Aumale= Norman Counts: *Guerinfroi, lord before 996-? *Guerinfroi Aymard (son) ?-1048 *Bertha of Aumale (daughter) 1048-1052 **Hugh II, Count of Ponthieu 1048-1052 (married to Bertha) *Enguerrand I of Aumale (married Adelaide of Normandy, who retained the lordship after her husband's death) *Adelaide of Normandy 1053-1087 with **Lambert of Boulogne 1053-1054 (married to Adelaide) =Counts of Aumale= Coat of arms of the Counts of Aumale, adopted late 12th century, at start of age of heraldry Anglo-Norman Counts: *Odo of Troyes 1069-1115 (married to Adelaide) *Stephen of Aumale before 1070-1127 *William le Gros 1127-1179 *Hawise of Aumale 1179-1194 with her husbands as Counts jure uxoris: **William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex 1180-1189 **William de Forz 1189-1194 **Baldwin of Bethune 1195-1196 *confiscated; to French royal domain.

The title of Count or Duke of Aumale was granted several times during this period. =Earls of Aumale (1095)= In 1196, Philip II of France captured the castle of Aumale (and, subsequently, the remainder of Normandy). However, despite this, the kings of England continued to claim the Duchy of Normandy, and to recognize the old line of Counts or Earls of Aumale.

Starting in 1939 they were called Landkreis. In 1972 two municipalities (Bachhausen and H√∂henrain) from the district Wolfratshausen were added to the district. In the 1978 communal reform the previously 42 municipalities were merged into the current 14 ones.

It is the fifth most popular shopping city in Friesland. It also had the smallest hospital in the Netherlands. __TOC__  History  The best-known event in Dokkum's history is the martyrdom of the Anglo-Saxon missionary Saint Boniface in 754. Oliver of Cologne preached the Fifth Crusade in Dokkum in 1214 and Dokkum sent a contingent; the crescent in the coat of arms of Dokkum refers to this event. Dokkum acquired city rights in 1298. In 1572 Dokkum was sacked by the Spaniards after it had joined the Dutch Revolt. In 1597, the Admiralty of Friesland was established in Dokkum. However, it was moved to Harlingen in 1645. In 1971 the city was included in the list of Dutch 'Urban and village conservation areas'.Urban and village conservation areas Netherlands In 1923, when Catholics in the Netherlands were not allowed to engage in public expressions of faith such as processions, a processional park was built south-east of the city center, the Boniface park. Central in the park is the so-called Brouwersbron, the brewers' well, which Titus Brandsma and others (incorrectly) identified as the well that sprang up after the saint's martyrdom. A chapel dedicated to Boniface was built in 1934. Brandsma, a Carmelite priest who was murdered by the Nazis in Dachau in 1942, also designed the park's Stations of the Cross, which were finished in 1949. Before 2019, the city was part of the Dongeradeel municipality.

It became the terminus for passenger services in May 1935 and closed to passengers in July 1936. The station reopened to passengers in May 1940 and closed to passengers in July 1942. Freight services ceased in 1975. There is still a bus station in Dokkum.  Urban development  The latest neighbourhood is called the 'Trije Terpen'. At the Trije Terpen is also the newest shopping area of Dokkum called, Zuiderschans. Other construction works in other parts of the city are also taking place, such as the Lyceumpark, the Fonteinslanden, the Veiling and the Hogedijken. In the future the industrial park, Betterwird, will expand even more to the west. It's an industrial park with more than 70 companies. In 2013, the construction of the Central Axis began. This is a road with a fast connection and few obstacles between Dokkum and Drachten. The road was delivered in 2016. = Population = The population of Dokkum increased by 5,378 people between 1960 and 2013. In recent years, the population has fluctuated around 12,500 inhabitants.  Sport  In the 200 km ice skating marathon known as the Elfstedentocht, Dokkum is known as the keerpunt (turning-point in Dutch), because it is where the speedskaters turn and head back to Leeuwarden. There are two different soccer clubs in Dokkum, VV Dokkum and Be Quick Dokkum. Windmills In 1652, Dokkum had five windmills, these were all post mills.Tonneel der Steden; Blaeu, 1652 Dokkum has two windmills, cap mills, that are preserved and both of them are open to the public by appointment. They are named Zeldenrust and De Hoop. A third mill, De Marmeerin stood by the Woudvaart outside the town. Since 2014 the mill was moved to be restored to working order. After restoration it is to be rebuilt at De s√ªkerei open-air museum in Damw√¢ld.

Dissatisfied with the religious policies of rebel leader Prince of Orange and the States General of the Netherlands, and especially the rise of the radical Calvinist Republic of Ghent since October 1577, they signed a declaration on 6 January 1579 about their intent to offer a vigorous defense of the Roman Catholic religion against what they saw as encroachments by Calvinists in other provinces. These signatories would begin negotiations for a separate peace with the Spanish Crown, which resulted in the Peace Treaty of Arras of 17 May 1579. Background After the Pacification of Ghent the entire Habsburg Netherlands united in opposition to the government of king Philip II of Spain, the overlord of the Netherlands. They formed the Union of Brussels that constituted a formal government, formed by the States General and a governor-general who was appointed by the States General: the archduke Matthias, in competition with the royal governor- general, Don Juan of Austria.Don Juan had initially recognized the Union of Brussels and even concluded the Perpetual Edict, but he broke in July 1577 with the States General; cf. Israel, p.187 Orange, the leader of the originally rebelling provinces, Holland and Zeeland, had a leading role in the Council of State that formed the executive for the States General.Israel, pp.186‚Äì187 One of the important provisions of the Pacification was that the Calvinists received freedom of religion in Holland and Zeeland, and would be tolerated elsewhere in the Netherlands, but that the other 15 provinces would officially maintain the Catholic Church as the dominant one.Israel, p. 186 Calvinists in other provinces soon also claimed freedom of religion. In Flanders and Brabant they even used force to change the government of cities like Ghent, Bruges, and Antwerp to obtain this objective, much to the dismay of Catholic politicians in the southern part of the country. Orange tried to promote civil peace with a policy of \\"religious peace,\\" allowing freedom of worship to both Catholics and Protestants in the entire Netherlands.Israel, pp. 193‚Äì196 Declaration of 6 January 1579 Don Juan died in October 1578 and was replaced as commander of the Spanish Army of Flanders and royal governor-general by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who proved an able diplomat, adept at driving wedges between the Catholic nobles in the South and the regime of Orange and the States General Who had moved from Brussels to Antwerp after the disastrous defeat of the Dutch States Army at the Battle of Gembloux (1578); Israel, p. 194. In opposition to the policies of Orange a group of Catholic nobles, known in historiography by the name \\"Malcontents,\\" had formed under the leadership of the stadtholder of Hainaut, Philip de Lalaing, 3rd Count of Lalaing and Emanuel Philibert de Lalaing. Parma opened negotiations with the Malcontents and they brought about an alliance of Hainaut, Artois, and the city of Douai, which on 6 January 1579 subscribed to a declaration in which they expressed their discontent about the events since the Pacification of Ghent, and (without naming names) rejected the \\"religious peace\\" policy of Orange.Edmundson, p. 71 The declaration issued in the following rousing promise: Beyond this promise the declaration did not contain more concrete resolutions, such as the formation of a defensive alliance, like a number of the northern provinces formed later in January 1579 in the form of the Union of Utrecht. But this was not to be expected, as the signers of the declaration considered themselves the \\"true\\" defenders of the Union of Brussels, that they intended to continue.Cf. the text of the declaration in Union d'Arras Peace of Arras However, the members of the Union of Arras soon opened peace negotiations with Parma, which resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Arras (1579) on 17 May 1579. These were the main conditions: * The provisions of the Pacification of Ghent, the Perpetual Edict and the Union of Brussels were reaffirmed, both by the Spanish Crown and the members of the Union of Arras; * There should be no more garrisons of foreign mercenary troops, either paid by Spain or by the States General; * The Council of State should be organized like that of the time of Charles V; * Two-thirds of the council members should be installed by all States of the member provinces consenting; * All privileges that were in force at the time of the reign of Charles V should be reinstated; * Taxes imposed after the reign of Charles V were to be abolished; * Roman Catholicism was the only allowed religion. Any other religion (i.e. Calvinism) should be prohibited.Cf.

Biography  Pipes was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia. He ran in the 1878 federal election against Charles Tupper, but was unable to wrest away Tupper's seat in the House of Commons of Canada. In 1882, Pipes ran as a Liberal candidate in the provincial election and won a seat. The Liberals unexpectedly won the most seats in the legislature despite the fact that they had no leader. William S. Fielding was at the time editor of the Halifax Morning Chronicle and could have become premier, but declined due to his lack of financial resources. The caucus selected Pipes to lead the party and become the sixth Premier. The position was an unpaid one at the time, so Pipes had to continue his law practice. Pipes served as premier for two years, but was hobbled by personal problems and the need to earn a living. He induced Fielding to enter cabinet, and they became close collaborators. The principal policy objective of the Pipes government was to secure a transfer of the Pictou railway line from the federal government to the province and to purchase and complete the privately owned \\"Eastern Extension Railway\\". The federal and provincial governments were unable to agree on a price, and the Pipes government abandoned the project. The Pipes government also tried to get financial assistance from Ottawa, but was unsuccessful, and was forced to cut government spending. Pipes' personal situation became increasingly untenable, and his relations with his cabinet (aside from Fielding) were frayed. On July 15, 1884, Pipes resigned as Premier, and nominated Fielding as his successor. Pipes broke with Fielding in 1886, however, as Fielding moved for the province's secession from Canadian confederation due to the federal government's neglect of the province's demands. During that year's election, Pipes referred to Fielding's campaign as \\"the putrid carcass of repeal\\". In 1887, Pipes again attempted to win a seat in the federal House of Commons, but again failed to dislodge Tupper. In 1906, he returned to provincial politics, and served as Attorney-General in the cabinet of Premier George H. Murray until his death in Boston. Pipes was involved in business as director of Amherst Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Co, a large shareholder in the Rhodes Curry Company, and director and secretary of the Nova Scotia Lumber Company. He held these positions during his time as a provincial cabinet minister.

It is a move that has a high degree of \\"initiative\\". Ideally, the zwischenzug changes the situation to the player's advantage, such as by gaining or avoiding what would otherwise be a strong continuation for the opponent. Such a move is also called an intermezzo , intermediate move , or in-between move . When the intermediate move is a check, it is sometimes called an in-between check , zwischenschach , or zwischen-check . As with any fairly common chess tactic, it is impossible to pinpoint when the first zwischenzug was played. Three early examples are Lichtenhein‚ÄìMorphy, New York 1857; Rosenthal‚ÄìDe Vere, Paris 1867; and Tartakower‚ÄìJos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca, New York 1924. The first known use of the term zwischenzug, however, did not occur until 1933, when the prolific American chess authors Fred Reinfeld and Irving Chernev used it in their book Chess Strategy and Tactics. History No one knows when the first zwischenzug was played, but it was evident long before the term itself existed.National Master Dennis Monokroussos observes that \\"just because authors didn't use the word 'zwischenzug' doesn't mean they didn't use the concept ‚Äì perhaps they simply used 'in-between move' instead\\". Fred Reinfeld and the Zwischenzug One early example was Lichtenhein‚ÄìMorphy, New York 1857. In the diagram, White has just captured Black's knight on e4 and surely expected the recapture 10...dxe4 11.0-0, when White's king is safe and he has the better pawn structure. Morphy, the strongest player of the day, instead played the zwischenzug 10...Qh4! with the threat 11...Qxf2#,Lichtenhein‚ÄìMorphy, First American Chess Congress, 1857 so White cannot save the bishop (11.Bf3?? Qxf2#). Moreover, 11.0-0 would be met by 11...Qxe4 12.Nc3 Qg6 (not 12...Qh4? 13.Nxd5!), when \\"Black has the two bishops and a compact position without serious weakness\\" . Instead, White correctly played 11.Qe2 (forcing Black to weaken his pawns), but then erred with 11...dxe4 12.Be3? (after 12.0-0!, Black has only a slight advantage)Encyclopedia of Chess Openings, Volume C, Third Edition, ≈†ahovski Informator, 1997, p. 301 n.72. Bg4! 13.Qc4? Bxe3!! and Morphy went on to win a . Rosenthal‚ÄìDe Vere, Paris 1867, is another 19th-century example of a zwischenzug . De Vere (Black) had earlier sacrificed a piece for two pawns. White has just played 16.Bxb4. Instead of recapturing with 16...Qxb4+, De Vere first played the zwischenzug (specifically, a zwischenschach) 16...Rc1+! After 17.Kd2 Rxf1 18.Qxf1 Qxb4+ 19.Ke2 Qxf4 20.Qg1 Nxe5, De Vere's zwischenzug had netted him two more pawns, leaving him with the of four pawns for a knight. White resigned after twelve more moves. Another prominent example that brought the concept of zwischenzug, albeit not the term itself, to public attention was Tartakower‚ÄìCapablanca, New York 1924. This was a game won by the reigning World Champion at one of the strongest tournaments of the early 20th century.Chessmetrics ranks New York 1924 as the ninth strongest tournament between 1900 and 1930. Strongest Tournaments 1900‚Äì1930 In the position in the diagram, Tartakower (White) has just played 9.Bxb8, thinking he has caught Capablanca in a trap: if 9...Rxb8, 10.Qa4+ and 11.Qxb4 wins a bishop . However, Capablanca sprang the zwischenzug 9...Nd5!, protecting his bishop and also threatening 10...Ne3+, forking White's king and queen. After Tartakower's 10.Kf2 Rxb8, Capablanca had regained his piece and went on to win in 20 more moves. Note that after 10.Bf4 (instead of 10.Kf2), Black would not play 10...Nxf4??, which would still allow 11.Qa4+, winning a piece. Instead, after 10.Bf4 Black would play a second zwischenzug, 10...Qf6!, attacking the bishop again, and also renewing the threat of 11...Ne3+ . After a move like 11.Qc1, Black could either take the bishop or consider yet a third zwischenzug with 11...Bd6. Alekhine, Reinfeld, and Tartakower and du Mont do not call 9...Nd5! a \\"zwischenzug\\" in their books (originally published in 1925, 1942, and 1952, respectively). Instead, they refer to it as, respectively, \\"a bit of finesse\\", a \\"sly interpolation\\", and an \\"intermediary manoeuvre\\" . The earliest known use of the term zwischenzug did not occur until after all of these games. According to chess historian Edward Winter, the first known use was in 1933.Edward Winter, Earliest Occurrences of Chess Terms. Retrieved on 2009-04-27. Fred Reinfeld and Irving Chernev, annotating the game Max Euwe‚ÄìGyula Breyer, Vienna 1921, called Breyer's 27th move, 27...Nge3!, \\"an important Zwischenzug\\" . The game can be played over here. Additional examples The diagram shows another example. Black, on move, plays :1... Rxh4? expecting White to play 2.Qxh4, when Black retains a material advantage. However, White has a zwischenzug: :2. Qd8+! which is followed by :2... Kh7 :3. Qxh4+ Kg8 :4. Qxg3 and White has won a rook, leaving him with a winning position.Tutorial =Mieses vs. Reshevsky= A zwischenzug occurred in Mieses‚ÄìReshevsky, Margate 1935. From the position in the diagram, play continued: :29. Nd4 Bxd4 :30. cxd4 White must have expected 30...Qxd4 31.Qxc4 Re1+ and then 32.Kg2 gets him out of trouble, but Black has a zwischenzug: :30... Re4! Making a on the d-pawn and preventing the capture of his own pawn. Now if 31.Qxc4, 31...Re1+ forces 32.Rxe1 and White loses his queen . =L. Steiner vs. Helling= L. Steiner‚ÄìHelling, Berlin 1928, provides another example of the zwischenschach (in-between check). Black has just captured White's pawn on f2 with his knight (see diagram). White responded with :16. Qxf2 expecting the skewer 16...Bg3??, which he would refute with 17.Qxf7+! Rxf7 18.Re8#. Instead, Black first played the zwischenschach :16... Bh2+! Now 17.Kxh2 Qxf2 loses White's queen. The game continued :17.Kf1 Bg3! Not seeing the point, White blithely continued with his plan: :18. Qxf7+?? Rxf7+ Now White realized that he is in check (that was the point of 16...Bh2+!), so his intended 19.Re8# is illegal. The forced 19.Bxf7+ Kxf7 would leave Black with queen for rook, an easily winning material advantage, so White resigned . =Kerchev vs. Karastoichev= In the game Zlatozar Kerchev‚ÄìEmil Stefanov Karastoichev, 1965 (see diagram), Black moved :1... Ng5 discovering an attack on White's queen. White moved: :2. Qxg6 (If White moves the queen to another square, Black's knight captures White's rook on f3, winning the exchange.) Instead of immediately recapturing the queen, Black played :2... Nxf3+ and White must get out of check. After :3. Bxf3 hxg6 Black had won the exchange . =Carlsen vs. Anand= In game 5 of the 2013 World Chess Championship match, Carlsen had captured a bishop with 20.cxb6, and Anand maintained material balance by capturing a knight with 20...fxe4, also attacking White's bishop (see diagram). Instead of immediately taking the pawn with 21.Bxe4, which would have given Anand the opportunity to fix his queenside pawn weaknesses with 21...axb6, Carlsen played the zwischenzug :21. b7 After the necessary :21... Rab8 :22. Bxe4 Rxb7 Anand's a- and c-pawns remained isolated. Black's weaker pawn structure was an important factor to Carlsen's initiative in this first decisive game of the match.

In addition to being a domain name registrar, Network Solutions provides web services such as web hosting, website design and online marketing, including search engine optimization and pay per click management. History Network Solutions started as a technology consulting company incorporated by Emmit McHenry with Ty Grigsby, Gary Desler and Ed Peters in Washington, D.C., in 1979. In its first few years, the company focused on systems programming services, primarily in the IBM environment. Annual revenues passed $1 million in 1982, growing to $18.5 million in 1986. Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) first operated the domain name system (DNS) registry under a sub-contract with the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in September 1991. NSI gave out names in the .com, .org, .mil, .gov, .edu and .net Top Level Domains (TLDs) for free, along with free Internet Protocol (IP) address blocks. The Network Information Center at SRI International had performed the work under Elizabeth J. Feinler since 1972. In 1992, NSI was the sole bidder on a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to further develop the domain name registration service for the Internet. In 1993, NSI was granted an exclusive contract by the NSF to be the sole domain name registrar for .com (commerce), .net (network) and .org (organization) TLDs, a continuation of work NSI had already been doing. NSI also maintained the central database of assigned names called WHOIS. A contract was given to Boeing to operate the .mil TLD registry, and was also performed by NSI under subcontract. In May 1993, the NSF privatized the domain name registry; Network Solutions was the only bidder on the $5.9 million annual contract to administer it. In March 1995, the company was acquired by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for $4.7 million. At that time, the company managed 60,000 domain names. Following the acquisition by SAIC, the NSF gave Network Solutions authority to charge for domain name registrations. Network Solutions imposed a charge of $100 for two years registration. 30% of this revenue went to the NSF to create an \\"Internet Intellectual Infrastructure Fund.\\" In 1997, a lawsuit was filed charging Network Solutions with antitrust violations with regard to domain names. The 30% of the registration fee that went to the NSF was ruled by a court to be an illegal tax. This led to a reduction in the domain name registration fee to $70 (for two years). Network Solutions also implemented a policy of censoring domain names. This came to light when Jeff Gold attempted to register the domain name shitakemushrooms.com but was unable to. Network Solutions' automated screening system blocked the registration \\"because it contains four letters they consider obscene\\", though the domain name 'shit.com' had been successfully registered. Network Solutions argued that it was within its First Amendment rights to block words it found offensive, even though it was operating pursuant to contract with a Federal agency. Network Solutions' $100 charge and its monopoly position in the market were contributing pressures that resulted in the creation of the International Ad Hoc Committee and a failed attempt to take control of the domain name system, and to the U.S. Department of Commerce and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) releasing a white paper and ultimately contracting with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to administer the DNS. In September 1997, the Network Solutions () became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO). After the formation of ICANN in 1998, the domain name industry opened up to partial competition, with NSI retaining its monopoly on .com, .net and .org but having to recognize a separation between the functions of a registry, which manages the underlying database of domain names, and that of a registrar, which acts as a retail provider of domain names. To achieve this separation, NSI created a \\"firewall\\" between the two new divisions of the business, creating separate technical infrastructure, organizations, and facilities. By the end of 1999 the fee for registration had been reduced, from $34.99, to a wholesale rate of $6 per year to registered resellers. In May 1999, Jim Rutt was named chief executive officer of the company; he stepped down in February 2001. In 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble, the company was acquired by VeriSign for $21 billion in stock (). On October 17, 2003, VeriSign announced the sale of Network Solutions to Pivotal Equity Group for $100 million. In January 2006, Network Solutions acquired MonsterCommerce, an e-commerce company in the Greater St. Louis area. In February 2007, General Atlantic, a private equity firm, acquired the company for a reported $800 million. In January 2008, Roy Dunbar was appointed CEO. On November 2, 2009, Tim Kelly, president of the company, replaced Dunbar as CEO. Dunbar continued to act as chairman and advisor to the company. In August 2011, Web.com announced the acquisition of the company for $405 million and 18 million shares of newly-issued Web.com stock (), which closed at $8.66 per share before the announcement, for a total purchase price of about $560 million. The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2011. This was immediately followed by the departure of CEO Kelly, and other leadership. Large scale employee layoffs began the following day as well. By December 31, 2011, over half of the office space in the Herndon, Virginia, headquarters had been vacated, and on March 31, 2012, the company's Belleville, Illinois, office was closed. 2008 domain name front running class action lawsuit Network Solutions offers a search engine which permits users to find out if a domain name is available for purchase. Unregistered domain names entered into this search engine are then speculatively reserved by Network Solutions.Domain Name Wire. \\"Network Solutions Faces PR Nightmare Over Domain FrontRunning\\", January 8, 2008. This \\"reservation\\" can be removed by anyone immediately by contacting Network Solutions customer service hotline, or it will automatically unreserve within four days, allowing the domain to be freely registered anywhere. Also, visitors searching for domain names on their website allow the reservation when they click \\"OK\\" on the Reservation Confirmation dialog box. Clicking \\"Cancel\\" will prevent the domain name from being reserved. On January 8, 2008, Domain Name Wire published a story alleging that Network Solutions practices domain name front running. \\"If you try to register a domain at Network Solutions, but decide not to register it, you won't be able to register it anywhere else\\", the article says. \\"Network Solutions registers the domain in its company name with the words 'This Domain is available at NetworkSolutions.com'.\\" Circle ID reported on January 8, 2008, that Jonathon Nevett, Vice President of Policy at Network Solutions and one of the seven members of the ICANN community who was consulted by the ICANN committee looking at registrar abuse of domain \\"tasting\\", as the availability search practice is called, had offered a response to the news story stating Network Solutions' policy. The policy was \\"a security measure to protect our customers\\", said Nevett. \\"When a customer searches for an available domain name at our website, but decides not to purchase the name immediately after conducting the search\\", Nevett added, \\"after the search ends, we will put the domain name on reserve.\\"Circle ID. \\"Network Solutions Responds to Front Running Accusations\\" by CircleID Reporter. January 8, 2008. Nevett said that if the domain was \\"not purchased within 4 days, it will be released back to the registry and will be generally available for registration.\\" But once a name was supposedly \\"reserved\\" for a potential customer, not only was it not available at any less expensive registrar, but the fee charged by Network Solutions went up to $35 instead of the original fee charged of around $10. Jay Westerdal, one of the seven members of the ICANN community who was consulted by the ICANN committee looking at domain tasting abuse,ICANN. \\"SAC 022 SSAC Advisory on Domain Name Front Running\\", page 10. October, 2007. published an article on Domain Tools on January 8, 2008, stating that Network Solutions is exposing the domains to domain tasters. The domain tasters \\"will snipe those domain up milliseconds after Network Solutions deletes them\\", says Westerdal. \\"It is a deplorable action that Network Solutions would announce potential domain names to the entire world\\", Westerdal added. On January 8, 2008, Tucows, the largest publicly traded domain name registrar, published an article on its company web site titled \\"Registrar Reputation and Trust\\" criticizing Network Solutions policy. \\"Potential Registrants are effectively forced to purchase the domain from Network Solutions for a period of four days at which point the domain is dropped\\", wrote Tucows employee James Koole. Koole says that Tucows has found a way to address the issue of domain tasting and has policies in place that uphold the rights of Registrants. \\"Tucows works to prevent domain name tasting by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)\\", Koole said. \\"Tucows doesn't use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names\\", Koole added.Tucows. \\"Registrar Reputation and Trust\\" by James Koole , January 8, 2008. On January 9, 2008, Cnet reported that Network Solutions will soon not register domains when people search for domains from the company's Whois search page, will offer only an \\"under construction\\" page for sites that it has reserved, and newly reserved pages won't be linked to the numerical Internet addresses that allow Web browsers to locate the pages.Cnet. \\"Network Solutions amends Net registration process\\" by Stephen Shankland.

Controversies =Server breach= In August 2009, Network Solutions notified customers that its servers were breached, and led to the exposure of names, address, and credit card numbers of more than 573,000 people who made purchases on Web sites hosted by the company. Susan Wade, a spokesperson for Network Solutions, said, \\"We really feel terrible about this\\". At the time of this writing, NSI does not know how their servers were compromised. =Malware= One year later in August 2010, Network Solutions discovered that one of their widgets offered to their domain registration and hosting customers was capable of distributing malware by sites displaying it. As many as 5,000,000 of their registered domains may have been affected by the hack. The affected widget was at least temporarily addressed by Network Solutions, who were able to make changes to the code to prevent it from loading. =WebLock Service= In January, 2014 Network Solutions' marketing department sent an email to customers stating that the company would be automatically enrolling customers in a new security program called WebLock, for an initial charge of $1,850 for the first year and $1,350 each subsequent year. The company claimed the cost offset new security features to protect domains, including registering as a \\"certified user\\" and confirmation of configuration changes with those \\"certified users\\". > ...

Wilders intended to host a film he had created, Fitna. At that time, the only page on the site was a picture of the Qur'an accompanied by the text \\"Geert Wilders presents Fitna\\" and \\"Coming soon\\". Network Solutions' notice stated that they were \\"investigating whether the site's content is in violation of the Network Solutions Acceptable Use Policy\\".Dutch Islam film website 'shut' BBC Wilders said the 15-minute film will show how verses from the Qur'an are being used today to incite modern Muslims to behave violently and anti-democratically. As a result of Network Solutions' decision, \\"fitnathemovie.com\\" was not available to the public on the day of the film's release. Wilders expressed his displeasure with Network Solutions for pre-censoring the domain name. Network Solutions also came under criticism because although they refused to host Wilders' website, they had provided registration services for the Hezbollah domain hizbollah.org.Networking Tools In response to these criticisms, Network Solutions agreed that hizbollah.org violated their acceptable use policy and ceased hosting that web site, as well. Due to heavy media coverage, many people were aware of the film's existence and the controversy surrounding its domain name. Some were outraged by the actions of Network Solutions in dealing with one of its customers. Freedom of speech protestors created videos commenting on the situation, and some uploaded Wilders' film to social networking sites such as YouTube shortly after its release. Protestors for both sides created their own blogs and video statements on the matter. Anti- censorship protestors took their campaigns to sites such as YouTube in order to alert others of the situation.Online Protesting Social Media User Protesting On March 23, 2008, Brian Krebs of the Washington Post published an article explaining more facts related to the event. Krebs wrote that Network Solutions spokesperson Susan Wade stated that Network Solutions had received several complaints regarding the website, but she did not elaborate on the specific nature of the complaints. =Controversy over subdomain hijacking= In April 2008, reports indicated that in addition to the aforementioned front- running practices, Network Solutions had begun exploiting an obscure provision of its end-user license agreement that permits it to use and advertise on its users' unassigned subdomains, even despite the registration and private ownership of the top-level domain itself. The provision states: > 'You also agree that any domain name directory, sub-directory, file name or > path (e.g.) that does not resolve to an active web page on your Web site > being hosted by Network Solutions, may be used by Network Solutions to place > a \\"parking\\" page, \\"under construction\\" page, or other temporary page that > may include promotions and advertisements for, and links to, Network > Solutions' Web site...'\\" Ars Technica has documented how to opt out of this scheme, but many private domain holders and privacy advocates cite the move as another step in Network Solutions' series of recent attempts to push the boundaries of profitability and responsibility in its domain practices. =Races.com controversy= According to a Wired.com article, in 1999 Network Solutions bungled the transfer of \\"races.com\\", accidentally placing it back into the pool of available domain names. MBA student John McLanahan purchased the domain privately for thousands of dollars. A domain name speculator was able to obtain it, and demanded $500,000 for its return. =Misleading customers over refunds= In April 2015, the Federal Trade Commission announced that Network Solutions had agreed to settle charges that it misled consumers who bought web hosting services by promising a full refund if they canceled within 30 days. In reality, the FTC stated, the company withheld substantial cancellation fees amounting to up to 30 percent of the refund.

Gladu; and commissioned 29 October 1946, Capt. Peter G. Hale in command. Service history =Mediterranean, 1947-1949= Manchester in the Mediterranean Sea, 9 March 1948. Manchester completed her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean and returned to Boston, her home port, 26 March 1947. There she was equipped with an experimental plastic cover for her bridge to be tested on her first transatlantic crossing. On 18 April, she steamed for the Mediterranean to lend visible support to the Truman Doctrine of 12 March. Returning to the East Coast for two weeks in June, she conducted a Naval Reserve training cruise out of Newport, R.I. She resumed her Mediterranean cruise 25 June, returning to Boston 30 November. Manchester completed two more deployments with the 6th Fleet (9 February to 26 June 1948, 3 January to 4 March 1949) before departing Philadelphia 18 March for assignment with the Pacific Fleet. =Far East, 1949= She arrived at Long Beach 3 April and departed two weeks later for the politically volatile Far East, entering the harbor at Tsingtao, China, 15 May. The cruiser operated in the Yellow, East China, and South China Seas until returning to Long Beach 28 November. During this time, the Nationalist Chinese forces, having suffered extreme setbacks, had begun their withdrawal to the island of Taiwan, 16 July, and the People's Republic of China had been proclaimed at Peiping, 1 October 1949. The success of the Red Chinese bolstered other Asian Communist aspirations. On 25 June 1950, North Korean leaders ordered their troops to cross the 38th parallel into South Korea. The United Nations quickly declared North Korea the aggressor and called on members of that body to repel the invasion, 26 to 27 June. =Korean War, 1950-1953= 1950 At that time, Manchester, docked at San Francisco, was undergoing overhaul. Work was sped up and by 1 August the cruiser was on her way to the Western Pacific. She arrived at Sasebo, Japan, in early September and joined TF 77\\\\. As part of a carrier group, she commenced operations in the Yellow Sea, supporting United Nations Forces air efforts against the elongated Communist communications lines by coastal patrol, blockade, and bombardment. On 15 September, Manchester provided fire support for the landings at Inchon. After the establishment of major control of the Inchon‚ÄìSeoul transport complex, she moved north to bombard North Korean troop concentrations on Tungsan Got, while aircraft from her strike force hit the railhead at Ongjin, 27 September. This action effectively slowed reinforcement of Communist forces in the south by disrupting their supply lines and keeping their troops occupied in defensive action. Manchester then steamed with her task group around the peninsula to support the invasion at Wonsan. Arriving 10 October, she commenced shore bombardment and patrol duties in support of the minesweeping operations in the area while planes from TF 77 conducted raids against North Korean vessels, road and rail centers, warehouses, and supply depots as far north as Songjin. The U.N. Forces soon reached the Yalu River and, as the heavy fighting appeared to be over, Manchester was reassigned, 29 October, to TF 72, then patrolling the Taiwan Straits. This patrol duty was ended shortly thereafter by the full scale intervention of Communist Chinese troops in Korea. On 3 December, the cruiser rejoined TF 77 and steamed to Hungnam to support the complete evacuation of that port and the demolition of its facilities. Completing this operation, the task force continued to defend U.N. units, effecting their safe withdrawal from untenable positions. 1951 Manchester alongside at Wonsan on 3 May 1951. On 8 January 1951, Manchester evacuated injured crewmembers from the Thai corvette HTMS Prasae, which had grounded the previous day behind enemy lines near Kisamon Tan on the east coast. Naval gunfire kept enemy soldiers from swarming onto the ship until, the ship having been declared unsalvageable, the remainder of the crew was taken off by the cruiser's helicopter. Guns from accompanying destroyers were then turned on Prasae. For the next month and a half, Manchester patrolled off the east coast of Korea. Firing at both shore and inland targets, she blasted communication and transportation centers, destroying and disrupting the enemy's equipment and troop concentrations. On 22 February, she steamed to Wonsan to add her guns to the siege and blockade of that port which had commenced five days earlier. She continued to conduct shore bombardment activities along the northeast coast, primarily at Wonsan and Songjin, for the remainder of her first Korean combat tour. On 1 June, Manchester departed Korean waters for Yokosuka en route back to Long Beach, arriving in California 15 June. Spending less than five months at home, the cruiser was underway for the Far East again 5 November. She arrived back in the combat zone 8 December and took up duties as flagship of TF 95, the U.N. blockading and escort force. 1952 By this time, the conflict had altered in character, from quick forceful action to perseverance in the systematic destruction of the enemy's personnel and equipment. To this purpose, TF 95 maintained a blockade along the entire Korean coast and bombarded the Communist's main supply routes, which, because of the mountainous terrain, lay on the narrow coastal plains. Manchester patrolled along the Korean Peninsula shelling military targets in areas such as Chinnamp'o, Chongjin, Tong'Cho-Ri as well as regularly returning to Hungnam, Songjin, and Wonsan to add to the destruction of those tightly held enemy positions. While her guns blasted, Manchester's helicopters continued her reputation as a good friend of downed pilots, performing rescues at sea and on land behind enemy lines. Her medical officers also worked overtime aiding sick and wounded members of the U.N. Forces. On 14 May 1952, Manchester completed her second tour in Korea and departed the bombline on the east coast of Korea. She returned to Long Beach 29 May, departing two weeks later for voyage repairs and overhaul at San Francisco. 1953 Manchester firing with her forward turret off the North Korean east coast, March 1953. The new year, 1953, brought no change in the negative results of the cease-fire talks begun at Kaesong 10 July 1951 and later moved to Panmunjom. The conflict continued and Manchester departed on 25 January for her third deployment in Korean waters. On 4 March, she rejoined TF 77 on the bombline off the peninsula's east coast. On 8 March, she returned to Wonsan and again commenced shelling Wonsan. She came back to this besieged city periodically during this tour, spending the remainder of the time on patrol along the bombline, providing fire support for the U.N. Forces at the eastern end of the frontline. On 23 July, Manchester departed Korea for Yokosuka. On 27 July, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed at Panmunjom and hostilities ended. On 28 July, Manchester got underway for her homeport, having successfully completed three combat tours with no major battle damage. =Pacific, 1954-1956= During 1954 and 1955, the cruiser was twice deployed for six month periods with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific. On her last return voyage she participated in Operation \\"Glory\\", the return to Hawaii of fifty unidentified American dead from the Korean War. Departing Yokosuka 20 January 1956, she stopped at Pearl Harbor for ceremonies and continued on to Long Beach, arriving 5 February. At the end of the month, she sailed for San Francisco, where she entered the Reserve Fleet 27 February, and decommissioned 27 June 1956. Struck from the Navy list 1 April 1960, she was sold 31 October 1960 to the Nicolai Joffe Corp.

Sign B2a is a red octagon with a white ' legend. Sign B2b is a red circle with a red inverted triangle with either a white or yellow background, and a black or dark blue ' legend. The Convention allows for the word \\"STOP\\" to be in either English or the national language of the particular country. The finalized version by the United Nations Economic and Social Council's Conference on Road Traffic in 1968 (and in force in 1978) proposed standard stop sign diameters of 600, 900 or 1200 mm. The United Kingdom and New Zealand stop signs are 750, 900 or 1200 mm, according to sign location and traffic speeds. New Zealand Transport Agency. Traffic Control Devices Manual: General requirements for traffic signs, In the United States, stop signs are 30 inches (75 cm) across opposite flats of the red octagon, with a -inch (2 cm) white border.

Regulatory provisions exist for extra-large 45-inch (120 cm) signs with 16-inch (40 cm) legend and -inch border for use where sign visibility or reaction distance are limited, and the smallest permissible stop sign size for general usage is 24 inches (60 cm) with an 8-inch (20 cm) legend and -inch (1.5 cm) border. The metric units specified in the US regulatory manuals are rounded approximations of US customary units, not exact conversions. The field, legend, and border are all retroreflective. In the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of the UN, the sign legend is specified to be either the English word ' or a local-language equivalent; some countries use both.

History of the Stop Sign in America. 1997. The first ones had black lettering on a white background and were , somewhat smaller than the current sign. As stop signs became more widespread, a rural-dominated committee supported by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) met in 1922 to standardize them and selected the octagonal shape that has been used in the United States ever since. The unique eight-sided shape of the sign allows drivers facing the back of the sign to identify that oncoming drivers have a stop sign and prevent confusion with other traffic signs. It was also chosen so that it could be identified easily at night since the original signs were not reflective. The more urban-oriented National Conference on Street and Highway Safety (NCSHS) advocated a smaller red-on-yellow stop sign. These two organizations eventually merged to form the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, which in 1935 published the first Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) detailing the stop sign's specifications. The MUTCD's stop sign specifications were altered eight times between 1935 and 1971. From 1924 to 1954, stop signs bore a red or black ' legend on a yellow field. Yellow was chosen because fade-resistant red materials were not available. Retro-reflective or self-lit signs were permitted in the 1935 MUTCD; retro-reflective ones were first required by the 1948 edition of the MUTCD, which also called for a height from the road crown to the bottom of the stop sign.Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 1948 Edition. Part 1A, Section 31. \\"[A stop sign] shall be mounted so that its bottom will be 2 feet above the crown of the roadway.\\" The 1954 MUTCD newly specified a white legend on a red field, and increased the mount height specification to 5 feet in rural areas. Red traffic lights signify stop, so the new specification unified red as a stop signal whether given by a sign or a light. The current mounting height of was first specified in 1971; A snow- covered stop sign in Grand Traverse County, Michigan, with a street name sign mounted atop =US mandate, international adoption= The MUTCD stop sign was already widely deployed in the United States when its use became mandatory in 1966. In 1968, this sign was adopted by the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals as part of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's effort to standardize road travel across borders. The Convention specifies that ' be written in English or the national language, and also allows a circular sign with red legend. Forty European countries are party to the Convention. Stop signs around the world Blue stop signs are used on private property in Hawaii The red octagonal field with white English-language ' legend is the most common stop sign used around the world, but it is not universal; Japan uses an inverted solid red triangle, for example, and Zimbabwe until 2016 used a disc bearing a black cross. Moreover, there are many variants of the red- and-white octagonal sign. Although all English-speaking and many other countries use the word ' on stop signs, some jurisdictions use an equivalent word in their primary language instead, or in addition; the use of native languages is common on U.S. native reservations, especially those promoting language revitalization efforts, for example, and Israel uses no word, but rather a pictogram of a hand in a palm-forward \\"stop\\" gesture. =Asia= Countries in Asia generally use a native word, often in a non-latin script. =Europe= Countries in Europe generally have stop signs with the text , regardless of local language. There were some objections to this when introduced around the 1970s, but now this is accepted. Turkey is a notable exception to this, instead using the Turkish word for stop: \\"dur\\". =Latin America= In most Caribbean, Central and South American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and Venezuela), signs bear the legend ' (\\"stop\\" in Portuguese and Spanish). Mexico and Central American countries bear the legend ' (\\"halt\\") instead. =Canada= Bilingual stop sign in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada In the Canadian province of Quebec, modern signs read either ' or '; however, it is not uncommon to see older signs containing both words in smaller lettering, with ' on top. Both stop and arr√™t are considered valid French words and the Office qu√©b√©cois de la langue fran√ßaise (OQLF) notes that the use of \\"stop\\" on stop signs is attested in French since 1927.panneau ARR√äT, Office qu√©b√©cois de la langue fran√ßaise, granddictionnaire.com. At the time of the debates surrounding the adoption of the Charter of the French Language (\\"Bill 101\\") in 1977, the usage of \\"stop\\" on the older dual-word signs was considered to be English and therefore controversial; some signs were occasionally vandalized with red spray paint to turn the word ' into \\"101\\".Photo by Flickr.com user \\"imagesdistributioncanada\\" However, it was later officially determined by the OQLF that \\"stop\\" is a valid French word in this context, and the older dual ' / ' usage is therefore not considered bilingual but merely redundant and therefore deprecated (√† √©viter). All newly installed signs thus use either one word or the other, but not both. In practice, the vast majority of signs use ' in Qu√©bec, while ' is usually seen in predominantly English-speaking areas. Bilingual signs with ' are placed in English-speaking areas of New Brunswick, Acadian regions of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba, National Capital Region and all border crossings of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. On First Nations or Inuit territories, stop signs sometimes use the local aboriginal language in addition or instead of English, French, or both.

In a majority of European and Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba in North America, junctions without traffic lights or roundabouts are controlled by stop signs on minor roads and by white, yellow and black priority diamond signs on the major road. In the UK, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, New Zealand, Russia, Germany and Australia, stop signs are restricted to situations wherein coming to a dead stop is deemed necessary because of severely limited sight lines. At the vast majority of minor intersections in these countries Give Way signs and/or equivalent road markings are used, though at busier crossing streets, Give Way signs may be replaced by roundabouts, which also work on the give way (rather than stop) principle. =North America= Stop signs are often used in North America to control conflicting traffic movements at intersections that are deemed not busy enough to justify the installation of a traffic signal or roundabout. In the United States, the stop sign is not intended as a traffic calming device, but is meant to be installed mainly for safety or to assign right-of-way. Stop signs may be erected on all intersecting roads, resulting in an all-way stop. Some research has concluded that stop signs do not offer measurable safety benefits over the Yield approach.Some factors influencing the road behaviour of vehicle drivers. R.J. Smeed, UK Road Research Laboratory.

Abishai Polusa, Department of Civil Engineering & Transportation Research Institute, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel. June 1984. Available online 4 July 2002. Other research has concluded that multiway stop signs do not effectively control traffic speeds, and can give rise to negative effects including increased traffic noise and pollution from braking and accelerating vehicles, enforcement problems, and reduced sign compliance.Bretherton, M. \\"Multi-Way Stops‚ÄîThe MUTCD Is Correct!\\" 1999 ITE Compendium of Technical Papers. Institute of Transportation Engineers, August 1999. On school buses An American school bus displaying front and rear folding stop signs A stop sign on a pivoting arm is required equipment on North American school buses. The sign normally stows flat on the left side of the bus, and is deployed by the driver when opening the door for picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the rear facing backwards. The stop sign is retroreflective and equipped either with red blinking lights above and below the ' legend or with a legend that is illuminated by LEDs. Unlike a normal stop sign, this sign indicates a two-way absolute stop, requiring other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain stopped until the sign is retracted. =Europe= In Europe, stop signs are generally placed at sites where visibility is severely restricted, or where a high crash rate has been noted. In some European countries, stop signs are placed at level crossings to mark the stop line. For most situations, Europe uses the give way sign instead. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, stop signs may only be placed at junctions with tramways or sites with severely restricted visibility. Until 2016, each stop sign had to be individually approved by the Secretary of State for Transport.UK Department of Transport. Traffic Signs Manual, Chapter 3: Regulatory Signs, Section 3.2, 9 September 2008 This requirement was removed by the 2016 amendments to the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions; the responsibility for approving stop signs now lies with local authorities. Section 79 of the Highways Act 1980 enables the government to improve visibility at junctions, as by removing or shortening walls or hedges. The Department for Transport considers improving visibility to be preferable to installing a stop sign. The former UK practice of using \\"Halt\\" or \\"Slow\\" at Major Road Ahead signs was discontinued in 1965 at the recommendation of the Worboys Committee.Great Britain. Report of the Traffic Signs Committee [Chairman, Sir Walter Worboys], 18 April 1963. Instead of replacing all the old signs with the new Vienna Convention sign, the sign became the standard one at UK priority junctions.\\"New traffic signs demonstrated on road at Birmingham.\\" The Surveyor and Municipal Engineer, vol 122, p880, 1963. Compliance requirements Laws and regulations regarding how drivers must comply with a stop sign vary by jurisdiction. In the United States and Canada, these rules are set and enforced at the state or provincial level. At a junction where two or more traffic directions are controlled by stop signs, generally the driver who arrives and stops first continues first. If two or three drivers in different directions stop simultaneously at a junction controlled by stop signs, generally the drivers on the left must yield the right-of-way to the driver on the far right. In all countries, the driver must come to a complete stop before passing a stop sign, even if no other vehicle or pedestrian is visible. If a stop line is marked on the pavement, drivers must stop before crossing the line. Slowing but not completely stopping is called a \\"rolling stop\\", sometimes nicknamed after a city or region where it is considered endemic (e.g., \\"Rhode Island roll\\" or \\"California stop\\") ‚Äì slowing down significantly but not stopping completely at the sign. This partial stop is not acceptable to most law enforcement officials, and can result in a traffic citation. In some countries such as Czechia, stopping is required only at a place where a driver has a sufficient view into the intersection, not at the border of the intersection (where a \\"STOP\\" line is not present). Therefore, if multiple drivers come from the same direction and all of them stop at appropriate place, they can continue without stopping again.https://www.autoskolaprikasky.cz/news/musim-na-stopce-zastavit- za-dalsim-vozidlem/ =Bicyclists= In some jurisdictions, such as the U.S. state of Idaho, the traffic code allows for bicyclists approaching a stop sign to slow down and yield to conflicting traffic, then proceed without stopping unless safety requires a full stop. The Idaho law has been in effect since 1982 and has not been shown to be detrimental to safety. Cyclist advocacy groups have sought similar laws for other jurisdictions in the United States. Disadvantages Stop sign placement can pose difficulties and hazards in applications where cross traffic is not controlled by a sign or light. Relatively long distance between the stop sign and the crossroad facilitates accurate perception of the speed of approaching cross traffic, but lengthens the time and distance required to enter and clear the junction. Relatively short distance between the stop sign and the crossroad shortens the time required for safe passage through the intersection, but degrades the ability of the stopped driver to accurately perceive the speed of approaching cross traffic. Specifically, drivers approaching an intersection from beyond the subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT) limit may be perceived by a stopped driver as standing still rather than approaching, which means the stopped driver may not make an accurate decision as to whether it is safe to proceed past the stop sign. Whether the distance between the stop sign and the crossroad is officially short or is shortened by drivers creeping past the stop line, they can lose the visual acuity of lateral motion, leaving them to rely on the SAVT. This can make it difficult to accurately estimate the movement of approaching cross traffic.

Via the Hocking and Ohio Rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining 139 square miles (360 km¬≤) in a mainly rural area of the Allegheny Plateau region. Its name is locally said to derive from early white settlers who in 1802 reached the creek on a Sunday, and so named it after the day of their discovery. (also see nearby Monday Creek.) Sunday Creek rises in southeastern Perry County and flows generally southwardly into northern Athens County, passing through the communities of Rendville, Corning, Glouster, Trimble, Jacksonville, and Millfield (site of the 1930 Millfield Mine disaster), to Chauncey, where it flows into the Hocking River. In Athens County north of Glouster it collects the East Branch Sunday Creek, 15.5 miles (25 km) long, which rises in Perry County and passes through Morgan County. Tom Jenkins Dam, constructed on the East Branch in Athens County in 1950 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, forms Burr Oak Lake, the site of Burr Oak State Park. In Glouster, Sunday Creek collects the West Branch Sunday Creek, 14 miles (22.5 km) long, which rises in Perry County and flows generally southwardly. Other significant Tributaries include Greens Run, Mud Fork, and Johnson Run, all perennial streams draining the area to the west of the creek. Sunday Creek in Glouster in 2006 A predominant land use in the watershed of Sunday Creek has historically been coal mining, with both underground and surface mines in the area.

Reconstruction is based on the discovery of large buried valleys in West Virginia, Ohio and Indiana and other evidence. The Teays River was a major preglacial river that drained much of the present Ohio River watershed, but took a more northerly downstream course. Traces of the Teays across northern Ohio and Indiana are represented by a network of river valleys. The largest still existing contributor to the former Teays River is the Kanawha River in West Virginia, which is itself an extension of the New River. The name Teays from the Teays Valley is associated with this buried valley since 1910.The Glacial Boundary in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois; George Frederick Weight; Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey No. 58; Washington, Government Printing Office; 1890; pg 86-88 The more appropriate name would be ancestral Kanawha Valley.Glacial Geology of Wabash County, Indiana: William J. Wayne and William D. Thornbury; Indiana Department of Conservation, Geological Survey; Bulletin No. 5; Bloomington, Indiana; 1951 The term Teays is used when discussing the buried portion of the ancestral Kanawha River. The Teays was comparable in size to the Ohio River. The River's headwaters were near Blowing Rock, North Carolina; it then flowed through Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. (Hansen, 1995).Teays River; ES 767 Quaternary Geology, Fall 2011; Wesley C. Smith; Emporia State University, Earth Science Department: Webpage submitted on November 28, 2011 The largest tributary to the Teays River was the Old Kentucky River (Teller 1991), which extended from southern Kentucky through Frankfort and subsequently flowed northeast, meeting other tributaries and eventually joining the Teays. Creation Scattered erratics in northeastern Kentucky and southern OhioLeverett; 1929, pp. 33-47 are pre- Kansan in age. Only the Nebraskan is recognized as earlier than Kansan; these have been designated as remnants of deposits left by the Nebraskan glacier.Thwaites, 1946, pl. 3 The ice sheet overrode the preglacial Teays creating ponds or glacial lakes. The back up of water diverted the upper basin over the surrounding divides into the preglacial Ohio River. Thus the ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô more likely is post-Nebraskan and pre-Kansan in age rather than preglacial. With the withdrawal of the Nebraskan glacier, which caused integration of the upper Kanawha (Teays) with the preglacial Ohio, a vastly shortened, unnamed descendant of the Teays apparently headed somewhere in west-central Ohio and cut the ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois during the long Aftonian interglacial stage, which followed. If the sequence of bedrock formations of northern Indiana were exposed, the extensive cliffs along the ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô of the Teays and its tributaries would provide a clearer understanding of the stratigraphy of northern Indiana. The entire Silurian section below the Liston Creek limestoneIndiana Division of Geology, 1949, pl. 2 and a few feet of the upper Ordovician probably would be visible in the vicinity of La Fontaine. In Wabash County the part of the Teays Valley above the ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô consists of broad terraces at an altitude of about . From this terrace level the bedrock rises gradually to the on the Lexington pene-plain surface. These terraces probably correspond in age to an erosional surface in the unglaciated areas known as the Parker strath, which was the result an erosion cycle that ended before the Kansan phase of the pre- Illinoian glaciation.Fenneman, 1938, p. 443 More recent correlationThornbury, 1948, p. 1359 places its age as pre-Nebraskan. The Parker strath probably represents an erosional level existent at the beginning of the Pleistocene before the rejuvenation associated with, and following, the Nebraskan glaciation. The general appearance and width of the strath terrace along the Teays Valley in Indiana indicates that it represents only a slight rejuvenation following the Lexington cycle. In Virginia and West Virginia, the Teays River flowed in the valleys of the modern New River and Kanawha River (Hansen, 1995). The river then flowed west to Scioto County, Ohio and to Ross County, Ohio near Chillicothe. The valley then disappears under glacial sediments but can be tracked using water well yields and other means (Hansen, 1995). A total of seven tills have been identified within the Teays River Valley (Andrews, 2004). In portions of Ohio, the buried valley is up to wide and lies beneath of glacial sediments (Hansen, 1995). Course The Teays River was a north- and northwest-flowing river existing before the Pleistocene Ice Ages ‚Äì before 2.5 million years ago.Professional Paper 13, Plate xviii; Wm Tight; U.S. Geological Survey; Washington, 1903 The Teays flowed through southwest West Virginia, between Kentucky and Ohio, and northwest across Ohio (see illustration).Ohio DNR: Geofacts: THE TEAYS RIVER The Teays then flowed under what is present-day Lafayette, Indiana and just north of Champaign, Illinois, and likely was coincident with the lower present-day Illinois River. The Teays River was dissected and largely wiped away by advancing glaciers and their meltwater. These glaciers were the massive continental ice sheets that began to cover large parts of Ohio and other states downstream (west) of Ohio between 2.5 and 3 million years ago. Their presence caused lakes (Lake Tight, Lake Monongahela, etc.) to form along the Teays and associated rivers. Overflow of these lakes into nearby, lower valleys caused large floods and new rivers to form. These new rivers ‚Äì formed about 2 million years ago ‚Äì included the present-day Ohio and Scioto Rivers, which are associated with the most direct evidence of the Teays. =West Virginia= The Teays River was the main stream of a preglacial river system. Its headwaters was near the eastern escarpment of the Blue Ridge, at the edge of the Piedmont Plateau in North Carolina and Virginia.Stout and Schaaf, 1931, pp. 671-672Stout, Ver Steeg and Lamb, Water in Ohio. Bulletin 44, Geol. Surv. Ohio, 1943, p. 51The Teays River; Karl Ver Steeg: The Ohio Journal of Science; Vol. XLVI, November, 1946 No. 6; College of Wooster; Wooster, Ohio The New River, the southernmost headwater of the Teays River, arises in Watauga County, North Carolina in the Blue Ridge. This area is northeast of Asheville. It flows northeasterly direction for some distance and after making a right-angled bend, it trends northward until it makes a 90¬∞ turn to the west and joins the Gauley River. Here, it takes a new name as the Kanawha River. This continues to the northwest to Charleston. As New River, it was joined by the Greenbrier and Bluestone rivers. At Charleston, the Kanawah, is joined by the Elk River. In its course, the Teays River cut across the folded Appalachians, a remarkable feature. The valley varies in width, from , an average of . A mile wide valley can be observed without a stream from St. Albans to Huntington. No doubt, a large stream once occupied this abandoned valley. Approaching Huntington, the Guyandotte River joins the general path of the ancient river beginning at Barboursville and follows it north until the former river veers west over the south hills of Huntington and joins the Ohio River Valley heading west towards Kentucky. The Ohio River follows the Teays path until leaving the Ohio River in the north end of Catlettsburg where it veers away just south of Ashland to Wheelersburg. The Ohio River has a floor of the original valley as shown by the silted flats south of Ashland and the terraces between Franklin Furnace and Wheelersburg. At Wheelersburg, the Teays River flowed northward past Minford, Stockdale and Beaver, to Waverly, through a high-level, broad, well- defined open valley. =Ohio= The Teays system in Ohio is known as the Parker Strath. The Teays River extended across Ohio in a northwesterly direction from Huntington, West Virginia. It is buried beneath the glacial drift. It then runs from Chillicothe to the border of Indiana, near Grand Lake St. Marys. The Scioto River has eroded and partially destroyed the Teays Valley from Waverly to Richmondale, but its floor exists as broad upland flats, near Omega and Higby. The Teays continued northward to Chillicothe, where it disappears under a layering of Wisconsin drift. From Chillicothe, the Teays Valley can be traced in a northwesterly direction past Andersonville, crossing the southwestern part of Pickaway County, past Atlanta. From there, it crosses the northeast corner of Fayette County near Waterloo, extending in a northwesterly direction past London in Madison County, to Vienna in Clark County. Here the Teays was joined by the Groveport River, which drained central Ohio. From Vienna, the Teays River continues in a westerly direction, to a point near Springfield, in Clark County, and thence northwestward past Boulusville and St. Paris in Champaign County, and Sidney, Anna and Botkins, in Shelby County, to the southeastern part of Washington Township in Auglaize County, where it was joined from the north by a tributary, Wapakoneta Creek. The Teays continued its course westward past the village of Mercer to Rockford. Continuing west to the Ohio-Indiana state line in Mercer County. =Indiana= The Teays Valley enters Indiana in Jay County and trends west. It turns to the northwest west of La Fontaine crossing Miami County south of the Wabash River. Reaching under Tippecanoe County, it continues west through southern Benton County and into Illinois. (Fidlar, 1948, pp. 12‚Äì15). =Illinois= In Illinois, the valley is called the Mahomet.(Horberg, 1945, pp. 349‚Äì350). It trends westerly across the state, into the bedrock valley of the Illinois River. Entrenched or ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô The ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô is used to describe the portion of the Teays Valley and other proglacial valleys carved into bedrock in the Great Lakes region. This includes Ohio Valley, near Madison, Indiana, before the Pleistocene;Malott, 1922, p. 137 the Wabash Valley; and the Mississippi Valley. The floor of the Teays Valley in West Virginia is above the entrenched Kanawha and Ohio valley floors, and its bedrock floor is at least above them. The ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô apparently was cut mainly after the diversion of the upper Kanawha (Teays) drainage to the Ohio River (Stout, Ver Steeg, and Lamb, 1943, pp. 78‚Äì79). The lowest bedrock altitude obtained along the course of the Teays Valley across Wabash County was above sea level in the vicinity of La Fontaine. The average gradient of the Mahomet Valley above Beardstown, Illinois, is about 7 inches per mile (11.1 cm per kilometer).Horberg 1945, p. 359 The altitude of the valley floor where it occurs beneath the present floodplain of the Wabash River should be about . The profile of the Teays is a gorge-like valley entrenched within a broad, old age valley. Steep walls high can be recognized along the buried trench. The inner valley has been called the ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô and is interglacial in age. Tributaries =Ohio valleys= In the unglaciated area of southern Ohio, tributaries reflect the adjacent hills, which are considerably reduced: low gradients, broad valleys for the size of the modern streams, and dendritic patterns, all features of maturity. The largest of the tributaries in Ohio are the Marietta River, Hamden Creek, Albany River, Barlow Creek, Portsmouth River, Logan River, Bremen Creek, Putnam Creek, Cambridge River, Groveport River, Mechanicsburg Creek, and Wapakoneta Creek. The Cincinnati River flows northeastward from the southwest corner of Ohio to Dayton, to join the Teays River. That a divide existed between the preglacial Teays and the Miami watershed. Well records do not indicate a broad depression, which widens northward and is of sufficient size to have accommodated so large a stream as the Cincinnati River. = Preglacial Eel Valley = The Eel Valley in Wabash County, Indiana follows a preglacial tributary of the Teays.(Horberg, 1945, p. 357). It too has a ‚Äòdeep stage‚Äô. At its junction with the Teays Valley it is just under above sea level. The tributary does not rise above through its length in Wabash County. =Illinois valleys= A tributary from the north enters the Mahomet Valley near Paxton, and important tributaries from the south, north of Danville, and in western Logan and Menard counties. Demise The Kanawha (Teays) was forced across a major divide when the return of the Laurentian ice sheet dammed the northward flow of the river. The diversion occurred during the Nebraskan or older pre-Illinoian glaciation. This is based on an analysis of the drift found in the valley from the Kansan or late pre- Illinoian age.Horberg, 1945, p. 353 Present-day remnants Visual remains of the Teays River today include large valleys containing only small streams (such as the mile-wide valley from Huntington to St. Albans in West Virginia and the valley extending north from Wheelersburg in Ohio). These valleys can be seen on aerial and satellite images. However, short segments of some such valleys are still occupied by the Ohio and Scioto Rivers. The Scioto flows through the valley in the opposite direction (south) to that taken by the Teays (north). Athens in southeast Ohio. The plateau was characterized by low, rolling hills and slow-moving rivers until glaciers disturbed regional streams. The distant ridge is actually a flat upland surface beneath Albany, OH. A shallow paleovalley, now filled with proglacial lake sediments, underlies the flat surface. The paleovalley once fed the Teays River and contains river and lake sediments. The valley was abandoned after the Ohio River was formed and surrounding streams cut downward to increase their valley depths. The Teays River was dissected and largely wiped away by advancing glaciers and their meltwater. These glaciers were the massive continental ice sheets that began to cover large parts of Ohio and other states downstream (west) of Ohio between 2.5 and 3 million years ago. Their presence caused lakes (Lake Tight, Lake Monongahela, etc.) to form along the Teays and associated rivers. Overflow of these lakes into nearby, lower valleys caused large floods and new rivers to form. These new rivers ‚Äì formed about 2 million years ago ‚Äì included the present-day Ohio and Scioto Rivers, which are associated with the most direct evidence of the Teays. The present Ohio- Mississippi river system contains some distinctive relict fish populations descended from Jurassic Period fishes of the Teays, such as the primitive bowfin (Amia calva) and various gars (Lepisosteus spp). Discovery The Teays River was discovered and named for the village of Teays, West Virginia by geologist William G. Tight (1865‚Äì1910).Wright, G. Frederick (1894), \\"The Cincinnati Ice Dam\\", The Popular Science Monthly, June issue, pp. 184‚Äì198. The small community of Teays is in the \\"riverless\\" Teays Valley that used to be the bottom of the Teays River. In 1886, Gerard Fowke recognized that the gorge west of Chillicothe, Ohio was larger than Paint Creek would have created. He claimed that a large river would have had to exist to create the wide and deep valley. Conventional geologists did not support his claim.A Great Lost River Gets Its Due; Walter Sullivan; Science, The New York Times; November 29, 1983 In 1903 William G. Tight, a professor at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, saw the same type of valley and small stream running from Charleston to the Ohio River. It had only a minor water course beyond St. Albans, West Virginia. Here, the Kanawha River turns north. Professor Tight sought in vain to persuade the geological community that this valley once carried a mighty river that continued across Ohio, Indiana and Illinois through a valley now deeply buried under glacial deposits. He called it the Teays (pronounced taze) River, for a village in West Virginia. Namesakes Teays Valley, West Virginia and Ashville, Ohio's Teays Valley Local School District are named after the former river.

The essential idea behind trial division tests to see if an integer n, the integer to be factored, can be divided by each number in turn that is less than n. For example, for the integer , the only numbers that divide it are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Selecting only the largest powers of primes in this list gives that . Trial division was first described by Fibonacci in his book Liber Abaci (1202).  Method  Given an integer n (n refers to \\"the integer to be factored\\"), the trial division consists of systematically testing whether n is divisible by any smaller number. Clearly, it is only worthwhile to test candidate factors less than n, and in order from two upwards because an arbitrary n is more likely to be divisible by two than by three, and so on. With this ordering, there is no point in testing for divisibility by four if the number has already been determined not divisible by two, and so on for three and any multiple of three, etc. Therefore, the effort can be reduced by selecting only prime numbers as candidate factors. Furthermore, the trial factors need go no further than \\\\scriptstyle\\\\sqrt{n} because, if n is divisible by some number p, then n = p √ó q and if q were smaller than p, n would have been detected earlier as being divisible by q or by a prime factor of q. A definite bound on the prime factors is possible. Suppose is the 'th prime, so that P1 = 2, P2 = 3, P3 = 5, etc. Then the last prime number worth testing as a possible factor of n is where ; equality here would mean that is a factor. Thus, testing with 2, 3, and 5 suffices up to n = 48 not just 25 because the square of the next prime is 49, and below n = 25 just 2 and 3 are sufficient. Should the square root of n be integral, then it is a factor and n is a perfect square. An example of the trial division algorithm, using successive integers as trial factors, is as follows (in Python): def trial_division(n: int) -> List[int]: \\"\\"\\"Return a list of the prime factors for a natural number.\\"\\"\\" a = [] # Prepare an empty list. f = 2 # The first possible factor. while n > 1: # While n still has remaining factors... if n % f  0: # The remainder of n divided by f might be zero. a.append(f) # If so, it divides n. Add f to the list. n /= f # Divide that factor out of n. else: # But if f is not a factor of n, f += 1 # Add one to f and try again. return a # Prime factors may be repeated: 12 factors to 2,2,3. Or 2x more efficient: def trial_division(n: int) -> List[int]: a = [] while n % 2  0: a.append(2) n /= 2 f = 3 while f * f <= n: if n % f  0: a.append(f) n /= f else: f += 2 if n != 1: a.append(n) # Only odd number is possible return a These versions of trial division are guaranteed to find a factor of n if there is one since they check all possible factors of n and if n is a prime number, this means trial factors all the way up to n. Thus, if the algorithm finds one factor only, n, it is proof that n is a prime. If more than one factor is found, then n is a composite integer. A more computationally advantageous way of saying this is, if any prime whose square does not exceed n divides it without a remainder, then n is not prime. Below is version C++ (without squaring f) template vector TrialDivision(U n) { vector v; T f; f = 2; while (n % 2  0) { v.push_back(f); n /= 2; } f = 3; while (n % 3  0) { v.push_back(f); n /= 3; } f = 5; T ac = 9, temp = 16; do { ac += temp; // Assume addition does not cause overflow with U type if (ac > n) break; if (n % f  0) { v.push_back(f); n /= f; ac -= temp; } else { f += 2; temp += 8; } } while (1); if (n != 1) v.push_back(n); return v; } Speed In the worst case, trial division is a laborious algorithm. For a base-2 n digit number a, if it starts from two and works up only to the square root of a, the algorithm requires :\\\\pi(2^{n/2}) \\\\approx {2^{n/2} \\\\over \\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\right) \\\\ln 2} trial divisions, where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\pi(x) denotes the prime-counting function, the number of primes less than x. This does not take into account the overhead of primality testing to obtain the prime numbers as candidate factors. A useful table need not be large: P(3512) = 32749, the last prime that fits into a sixteen-bit signed integer and P(6542) = 65521 for unsigned sixteen-bit integers. That would suffice to test primality for numbers up to 655372 = 4,295,098,369. Preparing such a table (usually via the Sieve of Eratosthenes) would only be worthwhile if many numbers were to be tested. If instead a variant is used without primality testing, but simply dividing by every odd number less than the square root the base-2 n digit number a, prime or not, it can take up to about: :2^{n/2} In both cases, the required time grows exponentially with the digits of the number. Even so, this is a quite satisfactory method, considering that even the best-known algorithms have exponential time growth. For a chosen uniformly at random from integers of a given length, there is a 50% chance that 2 is a factor of a and a 33% chance that 3 is a factor of a, and so on. It can be shown that 88% of all positive integers have a factor under 100 and that 92% have a factor under 1000. Thus, when confronted by an arbitrary large a, it is worthwhile to check for divisibility by the small primes, since for a = 1000, in base-2 n=10. However, many-digit numbers that do not have factors in the small primes can require days or months to factor with the trial division. In such cases other methods are used such as the quadratic sieve and the general number field sieve (GNFS). Because these methods also have superpolynomial time growth a practical limit of n digits is reached very quickly. For this reason, in public key cryptography, values for a are chosen to have large prime factors of similar size so that they cannot be factored by any publicly known method in a useful time period on any available computer system or computer cluster such as supercomputers and computer grids. The largest cryptography-grade number that has been factored is RSA-250, a 250 digits number, using the GNFS and resources of several supercomputers. The running time was 2700 core years.

Early years He was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina, on March 31, 1808 to Lawson Henderson and his wife Elizabeth Carruth Henderson. His birthplace Woodside, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. After graduating from Pleasant Retreat Academy, Henderson enrolled as a law student at the University of North Carolina. Upon his graduation, he studied 18 hours a day to pass his bar exam and was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar in 1829. Military service and move to Texas Shortly after becoming a lawyer, Henderson served in the North Carolina militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In 1835, Colonel Henderson moved to Canton, Mississippi where he opened a law practice. His attention soon turned to the Texas struggle against Mexico. Henderson began making speeches to raise money and an army to go to the aid of the Texas cause. Henderson and several volunteers traveled to Texas hoping to participate in the fight for independence. By the time the group arrived in June 1836, many of the major events had already taken place. The Texas Declaration of Independence had already been signed on March 2, and David G. Burnet was elected interim President of the new Republic of Texas on March 10. The Alamo had fallen on March 6, and Sam Houston had been victorious on April 21 at the Battle of San Jacinto. On May 14, 1836, Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna has signed the Treaties of Velasco agreeing to withdraw his troops from Texas. Interim President Burnet commissioned Henderson as a Brigadier general in the Texas Army, with orders to return to North Carolina to raise troops to serve in Texas. This Henderson did at his own expense. Government service in the Republic Sam Houston became President of the Republic of Texas on September 5, 1836, and appointed Henderson as the Republic's attorney general. In December of that same year, Henderson was named by Houston to replace the recently deceased Stephen F. Austin as Secretary of State for the Republic. In early 1837, Houston decreed Henderson as minister from the Republic of Texas to France at the Tuileries Palace, and to England at the Court of St. James's. During his tenure as minister, he was successful in securing the recognition of the independence of the Republic of Texas, and negotiated trade agreements with both countries. Governor of Texas, war with Mexico, United States Senator In 1840, Henderson returned to Texas and set up a private law practice in San Augustine. He was sent to Washington, D.C. in 1844 to work in coordination with Isaac Van Zandt to secure the annexation of Texas to the United States. Although the annexation treaty was signed, it was rejected by the United States Senate, and Henderson was recalled to Texas. An annexation treaty approved the United States Senate was finally passed on December 29, 1845. In preparation for anticipated statehood, the Texas gubernatorial election, 1845 elected Henderson as its first governor. He took office on February 19, 1846. When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in April of that year, Henderson took a leave of absence as governor to command a Texas volunteer cavalry division. He served with the rank of major general under Zachary Taylor. He returned home to resume his duties as governor, but did not run for a second term. He later served in the United States Senate from November 9, 1857 until his death on June 4, 1858. Personal life and death Henderson's cenotaph at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington D.C. Henderson met his future wife Frances Cox when he represented the Republic of Texas as a minister to France and England. Cox was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and educated in Europe. She was a multi-linguist literary translator. On October 30, 1839, they were wed at St George's, Hanover Square. In 1840, the new couple established a residence and law office in San Augustine, Texas. The couple had five children, of which daughters Martha, Fanny and Julia lived to adulthood. Henderson died in Washington, D.C. in 1858 while he was serving as senator for the State of Texas. He is buried at the Texas State Cemetery. After his death during the Civil War years, his widow and daughters moved to Europe. Martha died at age eighteen. Fanny married into the Austrian aristocracy. Julia married an American sugar-plantation owner. Frances Cox Henderson died in 1897 and is buried at Rosedale Cemetery in New Jersey, where she had been living with daughter Julia and son-in-law Edward White Adams.

Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 2). to the faces, who are the heroic protagonist or \\"good guy\\" characters. Not everything a heel wrestler does must be villainous: heels need only to be booed or jeered by the audience to be effective characters, although most truly successful heels embrace other aspects of their devious personalities, such as cheating to win or using foreign objects. \\"The role of a heel is to get 'heat,' which means spurring the crowd to obstreperous hatred, and generally involves cheating and pretty much any other manner of socially unacceptable behavior that will get the job done.\\" To gain heat (with boos and jeers from the audience), heels are often portrayed as behaving in an immoral manner by breaking rules or otherwise taking advantage of their opponents outside the bounds of the standards of the match. Others do not (or rarely) break rules, but instead exhibit unlikeable, appalling and deliberately offensive and demoralizing personality traits such as arrogance, cowardice or contempt for the audience. Many heels do both, cheating as well as behaving nastily. No matter the type of heel, the most important job is that of the antagonist role, as heels exist to provide a foil to the face wrestlers. If a given heel is cheered over the face, a promoter may opt to turn that heel to face or the other way around, or to make the wrestler do something even more despicable to encourage heel heat. Some performers display a mixture of both positive and negative character traits. In wrestling terminology, these characters are referred to as tweeners (as a sort of short hand for the \\"in- between\\" good and evil actions these wrestlers display). WWE have been cited as a company that is doing away with the traditional heel/face format due in part to audiences' willingness to cheer for heels and boo babyfaces. In \\"local\\" wrestling e.g. American wrestling, it was common for the faces to be \\"local\\" (e.g. Hulk Hogan) and the heels to be portrayed as \\"foreign\\" (e.g. Alberto Del Rio, Ivan Koloff, The Iron Sheik, Rusev, Jinder Mahal, and Muhammad Hassan). In the world of lucha libre wrestling, most rudos are generally known for being brawlers and for using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size, often having outfits akin to demons, devils, or other tricksters. This is contrasted with most heroic t√©cnicos that are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly aerial maneuvers.  History  Common heel behavior includes cheating to win (e.g. using the ropes for leverage while pinning or attacking with a weapon while the referee is looking away), employing dirty tactics such as blatant chokes or raking the eyes, attacking other wrestlers backstage, interfering with other wrestlers' matches, insulting the fans or city they are in (referred to as \\"cheap heat\\") and acting in a haughty or superior manner.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 117). With his flamboyant gimmick, Gorgeous George became one of the most famous wrestlers of his era More theatrical heels would feature dramatic outfits giving off a nasty or otherwise dangerous look, such as wearing corpse paint over their faces, putting on demonic masks, covering themselves in dark leather and the like. Gorgeous George is regarded as the father of the wrestling gimmick, and by extension the heel gimmick. Starting in the 1940s, he invented an extravagant, flamboyant \\"pretty boy\\" gimmick who wore wavy blonde hair, colorful robes and ritzy outfits, and was accompanied by beautiful valets to the ring for his matches. The crowd widely jeered his persona, and came out to his matches in hopes of seeing him defeated. George relished this attention, and exploded into the one of the most famous (and hated) heels not only of his era, but of all time. Another example of a dramatic heel is the wrestler The Undertaker, who, on many separate occasions throughout his career, has switched between portraying a heel or a face. During his period as the leader of The Ministry of Darkness, he appeared as a priest of the occult in a hooded black robe and literally sat in a throne, often in the shape of the symbol used to represent him. Occasionally, faces who have recently turned from being heels still exhibit characteristics from their heel persona. This occurs due to fans being entertained by a wrestler despite (or because of) their heel persona, often due to the performer's charisma or charm in playing the role. Certain wrestlers such as Eddie Guerrero and Ric Flair gained popularity as faces by using tactics that would typically be associated with heels, while others like Stone Cold Steve Austin, Scott Hall and more recently Becky Lynch displayed heelish behavior during their careers yet got big face reactions, leading them to be marketed as antiheroes. Roman Reigns received negative reactions from the audience despite being promoted as a face On other occasions, wrestlers who are positioned as faces receive a negative audience reaction despite their portrayal as heroes. An example is Roman Reigns, who in 2018 was a top face in WWE, but got booed in his matches while his opponents got cheered regardless of their status as face or heel, due to perceived favoritism from WWE executives and a lack of character development. Such characters often (but not always) become nudged into becoming villains over time or retooled to present a different public image, such as The Rock's heel turn from a clean-cut face to self-absorbed narcissist in the heel Nation of Domination stable. The term \\"heel\\" does not, in itself, describe a typical set of attributes or audience reaction, but simply a wrestler's presentation and booking as an antagonist. Depending on the angle, heels can act cowardly or overpowering to their opponents. For instance, a \\"closet champion\\" in particular is a term for a heel in possession of a title belt who consistently dodges top flight competition and attempts to back down from challenges. Examples include Seth Rollins during his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship reign, Charlotte during her Divas/Raw Women's Championship reign, the Honky Tonk Man during his long Intercontinental Championship reign, Tommaso Ciampa during his NXT Championship reign and The IIconics during their WWE Women's Tag Team Championship reign. Brock Lesnar's character in WWE has had largely heel aspects, and he too was well known for failing to frequently defend his title (especially during his first Universal Championship reign), often only performing on pay-per-view events and not on SmackDown or especially Raw. This helps to affirm the intended kayfabe reactions that the face(s) that said heel is feuding with is/are more deserving of the title. Heels may in fact beg for mercy during a beat down at the hands of faces, even if they have delivered similar beat downs with no mercy, with Ric Flair in particular being well known for begging an opponent off, then hitting a low blow on his distracted opponent. Other heels may act overpowering to their opponents as to play up the scrappy underdog success story for the face instead. And now in 2020 Mustafa ali turn heel on RAW when he reveal him as the leader of Retribution .Brock Lesnar has played heel in both capacities, but has become quite famous (either as a heel or a face) as an almost-unstoppable machine who can take down anything in his path.

Traditionally, they wrestle within the rules and avoid cheating (in contrast to the villains who use illegal moves and call in additional wrestlers to do their work for them) while behaving positively towards the referee and the audience. Such characters are also referred to as \\"blue-eyes\\" in British wrestling and t√©cnicos in lucha libre. The face character is portrayed as a hero relative to the heel wrestlers, who are analogous to villains.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.2) Not everything a face wrestler does must be heroic: faces need only to be clapped or cheered by the audience to be effective characters. When the magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated went into circulation in the late 1970s, the magazine referred to face wrestlers as \\"fan favorites\\" or \\"scientific wrestlers,\\" while heels were referred to as simply \\"rulebreakers.\\" The vast majority of wrestling storylines involving faces place a face against a heel, although more elaborate set-ups (such as two faces being manipulated by a nefarious outside party into fighting) often happen as well. In the world of lucha libre wrestling, most t√©cnicos are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly aerial maneuvers and wearing outfits using bright colors with positive associations (such as solid white). This is contrasted with most villainous rudos that are generally of them known for being brawlers, using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size while often having outfits akin to demons or other nasty characters.  History  Traditional faces are classic \\"good guy\\" characters who rarely break the rules, follow instructions of those in authority such as the referee, are polite and well-mannered towards the fans and often overcome the rule-breaking actions of their heel opponents to cleanly win matches. While many modern faces still fit this model, other versions of the face character are now also common. A good example would be Stone Cold Steve Austin, who despite playing a heel early on in his career would start to be seen more of an antihero because of his popularity with the fans. While clearly not championing rule following, nor submission to authority, Austin was still regarded as the face in many of his duels such as his rivalry with World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) owner Mr. McMahon. Sting (pictured) used tactics more commonly associated with heels The portrayal of face wrestlers changed in the 1990s with the birth of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), the start of World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) New World Order (nWo) storyline, and the Attitude Era of the WWF. During this time, wrestlers like Stone Cold Steve Austin and Sting used tactics traditionally associated with heels, but remained popular with the fans. Professional wrestling had just come off a huge steroid scandal and was facing poor ratings compared to the 1980s, and as a result, professional wrestling transformed into an edgier, more mature product. In this new era of professional wrestling, the standard face was more profane, violent, and uncontrollable. In contrast to the emerging new breed of faces, Kurt Angle was introduced to the then-WWF with an American hero gimmick based on his gold medal win at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Angle presented himself as a role model and stressed the need to work hard to realize one's dreams. Although such a personality appears appropriate for a face wrestler, Angle's character was arrogant and constantly reminded people of his Olympic glory, behaving as if he thought he was better than the fans. Angle's character served as a meta-reference to how wrestling had changed. Although his character was intended to be a heel and behaved accordingly, some commentators speculated that if Angle attempted to get over as a face using a more heroic version of the same character, he would have failed. Unusually, Angle did not use any of these heroic mannerisms when playing a face character, instead acting as somewhat of an antihero with a few elements of the \\"lovable loser\\" character archetype. The majority of the time, faces who are low-carders, or lesser known, are used as jobbers. These wrestlers usually lose matches against established wrestlers, often heels that then lose to the top faces.  Fan reactions  Fans sometimes dislike face wrestlers despite the way they are promoted. Some reasons for this include repetitive in-ring antics, a limited moveset, a lengthy title reign, lack of selling their opponents' moves, or an uninteresting character. This often results in wrestlers who are supposed to be cheered receiving a negative or no reaction from the fans. When this happens, it can prompt a change in character for the wrestler in question. For example, Batista's run as a face upon his return to the WWE in 2014 was met with overwhelmingly negative reactions from the fans. Because of this unexpected reaction, Batista turned heel within just a few months of his return. The reaction of the fans can also influence a wrestler's booking and position on the card. Faces that get more support than expected sometimes move closer towards the main event scene, while those getting less of a reaction than hoped might move down on the card. While Batista was getting bad reactions in 2014, another face Daniel Bryan, was getting incredibly positive support. In late 2013 Bryan was constantly cheated out of the WWE Championship by on-screen authority figures, much to the fans' dismay, and it did not look like he was slotted to take back his place in the main event anytime soon. Loud \\"Yes!\\" chants that had become synonymous with Bryan were present at any show he was on, and eventually the main event of WrestleMania XXX would be changed from Batista vs Randy Orton for the WWE Championship, to a triple threat match with Daniel Bryan which he would go on to win.  Mannerisms  Wrestler Rey Mysterio is an example of a pure face who has played heroic roles for almost his entire career, with his lucha libre inspired outfit prominently displaying Christian crosses Some face wrestlers often give high fives or give out merchandise to fans while entering the ring before their match, such as T-shirts, sunglasses, hats and masks. Bret Hart was one of the first superstars to make this popular, as he would drape his signature sunglasses on a child in the audience. Rey Mysterio, who has been a face in WWE since his debut, would go to any fan (frequently a child) wearing a replica of his mask and touch their head with his head for good luck before wrestling. Other examples include John Cena throwing his shirts and caps in the crowd before entering a match and Big Show giving his hat to a fan when he was a face. Some faces, such as Bret Hart and Ricky Steamboat, promoted an image as a \\"family man\\" and supported their persona by appearing with their family members before and after matches. Steamboat famously carried his 8-month-old son Richard Jr. into the ring with him at WrestleMania IV before his match with Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine, then handing him to his wife Bonnie before the match started. These actions often relate to wrestlers promoting charity work or other actions outside the ring, blurring the lines between scripted wrestling and their personal lives. In the ring, traditional faces are expected to abide by the rules and win matches by their own skill rather than by cheating, outside interference etc. Because heel wrestlers take little issues with using such tactics, the face enters many matches already at a disadvantage to the heel. By putting the face in a difficult situation, it can help to draw out sympathy and support from the audience. Traditional faces similar to Hulk Hogan tend to draw on support from the crowd when it's time for them to make their big comeback. In addition to wrestlers, commentators also portray face and heel dynamics. It is the job of the face commentator to criticize the tactics and behavior of the heel wrestler and gather support for the face wrestler. The face commentator gathers support for the face wrestler by mentioning how much of a disadvantage he is at, or by praising the hero's morality and valor.

Ward (1994) assigned this genus to Amblyoponini within the subfamily Ponerinae on the basis of the worker morphology of the type species Adetomyrma venatrix. Later, Bolton (2003) raised this tribe to subfamily status as Amblyoponinae. Biology The colonies, the first of which was found in a rotting log, may contain as many as 10,000 workers, winged males and several wingless queens (the majority of ant species feature winged queens). The workers use venom to stun their prey which are brought back to the colony for the larvae to feed upon. The colour of the winged males, a darker orange than the workers, suggests they disperse by flying to other colonies before mating.

The parish includes the hamlet of Churchend. Village Charfield is a medium-sized village of about 2,500 residents with three pubs, the Pear Tree, Railway Tavern and The Plough Inn, a convenience store with Post Office and two churches. There are six main housing areas. Farm Lees, Longs View, Manor Lane and Woodlands have existed for some time. Two new housing developments were built in 2018-2019: St James Mews, opposite St James Church, and Charfield Village, at the eastern end of the village near the Renishaw PLC site. The primary school has around 250 students. The Church of St James, in Churchend, dates from the 13th century and is a grade I listed building. Governance An electoral ward with the same name exists. This ward starts in the east in Charfield and then stretches west to Falfield. The ward's population at the 2011 census was 4,678. The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the Memorial Hall and playing field and playground, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish council is also a burial authority, and has its own burial ground in nearby Churchend. Railway The Bristol-Birmingham main railway line runs through the village. Charfield railway station closed in January 1965 but still stands, and discussions continue about the viability of re-opening it. The costs of re- opening would be shared between Gloucestershire and South Gloucestershire Councils since, although the station would be in South Gloucestershire, the nearby Gloucestershire town of Wotton-under-Edge would be a principal beneficiary. The railway line marks the division of the village between two different telephone areas (01453-54x based on Wotton-under-Edge, and 01454-26x based on Falfield). The village is on the outer limits of both areas. The village has now been fibre-enabled, allowing FTTC connections. Railway history The Charfield railway disaster was a fatal train crash which occurred on 13 October 1928. The Leeds to Bristol LMS night mail train crashed under a road bridge near Charfield railway station, killing 15 and injuring 23. Amongst the dead were two children whose remains remain unidentified.

Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster. Accessed 24 Jun. 2020. \\"little flank\\") is a pattern of wherein a bishop is developed to the second rank of the adjacent b- or g-, the having been moved one or two squares forward. The fianchetto is a staple of many \\"hypermodern\\" openings, whose philosophy is to delay direct occupation of the with the plan of undermining and destroying the opponent's central outpost. It also regularly occurs in Indian defences. The fianchetto is less common in Open Games (1.e4 e5), but the is sometimes fianchettoed by Black in the Ruy Lopez or by White in an uncommon variation of the Vienna Game. One of the major benefits of the fianchetto is that it often allows the fianchettoed bishop to become more active. However, a fianchettoed position also presents some opportunities for the opponent: if the fianchettoed bishop can be , the squares the bishop was formerly protecting will become weak (see ') and can form the basis of an attack (particularly if the fianchetto was performed on the ). Exchanging the fianchettoed bishop should not be done lightly, therefore, especially if the enemy bishop of the same colour is still on the board. Concept The adjacent diagram shows three different sorts of fianchetti (not as part of an actual game, but as separate examples that have been collapsed into a single chessboard). White's king bishop is in a regular fianchetto, with the knight pawn advanced one square and the bishop occupying the long diagonal. This is by far the most common type of fianchetto, seen in the Sicilian Dragon, Pirc Defence, Modern Defence, Modern Benoni, Gr√ºnfeld Defence and King's Indian Defence, among other openings. Black's queen bishop is also fianchettoed, but the knight pawn has moved forward two squares, making this a long fianchetto. The b-pawn also controls the c4-square, which is often advantageous. If White plays the King's Indian Attack 1.Nf3 2.g3, Black may play a long queen's fianchetto to oppose White's bishop and make it more difficult for White to play a c4 . A long fianchetto on the kingside is more rarely played, because it weakens the pawn shield in front of the castled position and controls a less important square. Nevertheless, Grob's Attack 1.g4 and the Borg Defence (\\"Grob\\" backwards) 1.e4 g5 are sometimes played by players such as IM Michael Basman. White's queen bishop has moved to a3 in what is sometimes called an extended fianchetto. Rather than control the long diagonal, it takes aim at Black's f8-square. If Black moves his e-pawn, White can play Bxf8, after which Black will have to waste on artificial castling after recapturing with his king. This tactic is often seen in the Evans Gambit and gives the Benko Gambit much of its bite. Black often plays ...Ba6 in the French Defence, and the Queen's Indian Defence if White plays g3 in order to fianchetto his own bishop (Aron Nimzowitsch's move against the classical main line). Four fianchettoed bishops The game Rubinstein‚ÄìNimzowitsch, Marienbad 1925, had four fianchettoed bishops, two developed knights, and two on their home squares. In this position, Nimzowitsch humorously pointed out in My System: \\"Each side castles now with a clear conscience, for not even the most hypermodern pair of masters can produce more than four fianchettoed Bishops!\\" References Bibliography * * Further reading * * ‚ÄúThe Chess Fianchetto‚Äù by Edward Winter Category:Chess terminology Category:Italian words and phrases ","title":"Fianchetto"},{"id":"557691","text":"Terragen is a scenery generator program for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X developed and published by Planetside Software.

It is the principal settlement in the civil parish of Sodbury, which also includes the village of Old Sodbury. Little Sodbury is a nearby but separate civil parish. Sodbury parish council has elected to be known as Sodbury Town Council. At the 2001 census the population of Chipping Sodbury was 5,066, but in the last decade the town has become part of a much larger built-up area due to the rapid expansion of nearby Yate, with which it is contiguous to the west. At the census the combined population of Yate and Chipping Sodbury was 26,855. Governance An electoral ward in the same name (not Sodbury) exists. This ward starts in the north at Chipping Sodbury Golf Course and stretches south to Dodington. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,834. Transport East of the town is the Chipping Sodbury Tunnel, a railway tunnel under the Cotswolds 2 miles 924 yards (4.06 km) long, which was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1902. The tunnel is notorious for flooding in wet weather, often leading to disruption of services on the main railway line to and from South Wales. Chipping Sodbury had a railway station from 1903 to 1961. Yate station, on the Bristol to Birmingham main line, closed in January 1965 but reopened in May 1989. Cultural activities Chipping Sodbury hosts a twice yearly Mop Fair, usually the last weekends of March and September. The town holds a Festival Week in early June, including a \\"Big Lunch\\" where the main road is closed and residents bring picnics to eat on the street. A Big Lunch is also held in December to combat loneliness amongst elderly people at Christmas. There is a farmers' market twice a month, on the second and fourth Saturdays. A Victorian Day is held on the first Saturday in December. The event starts with school choirs performing in the street, followed by the arrival of Father Christmas with snow guaranteed (from a blower). The streets are lined with stalls from local charities and organisations and old time amusements, including a Ferris wheel, Helter Skelter and two children's rides. Choirs sing, bands play, and stalls bring a market feel. A Hog Roast is held. The town celebrated its 800th anniversary in August 2018 with a weekend of medieval activities including another Big Lunch. A time capsule was buried containing photographs of local businesses and poems written by local schoolchildren. The capsule is to be dug up on the town's 900th anniversary in August 2118. The town is served by a community radio station, GLOSS FM which broadcasts 365 days a year on its webcasts and twice a year on 87.7 MHz FM. Education Chipping Sodbury has two government funded primary schools and a secondary school. Chipping Sodbury School, the secondary school, caters for children aged 11 to 18 and describes itself as a 'Specialist Technology School'. The School shares a sixth form, named Cotswold Edge, with both Brimsham Green School and Yate International Academy. Subjects taken by students are split between the three locations. The School obtained a 'Requires Improvement' status from Ofsted in 2018. St John's Mead Primary School is named after the local CoE church. The other Primary School is Raysfield Infants and Junior schools. Also within the parish boundary is Old Sodbury Primary School. Dodington Parish Hall, which is situated next to Raysfield Junior and Infant Schools, is also the home of Raysfield pre-school. Toponymy  The town's name is recorded in Old English (in the dative case) as Soppanbyrig = \\"Soppa's fort\\". \\"Chipping\\" (from Old English cƒìping) means that a market was held there.

A mansion is a large dwelling house. The word itself derives through Old French from the Latin word mansio \\"dwelling\\", an abstract noun derived from the verb manere \\"to dwell\\". The English word manse originally defined a property large enough for the parish priest to maintain himself, but a mansion is no longer self-sustaining in this way (compare a Roman or medieval villa). Manor comes from the same root‚Äîterritorial holdings granted to a lord who would \\"remain\\" there. History Within an Ancient Roman city, dwellings owned by aristocratic or wealthy people could be very extensive and luxurious. Such mansions on one hill in Rome became so extensive that the term palatial was derived from the name Palatine hill and is the etymological origin of \\"palace\\". Mansions of considerable size and state significance are called palaces. Renaissance villas such as Villa Rotonda near Vicenza were an inspiration for many later mansions, especially during the industrialisation. Following the fall of Rome, the practice of building unfortified villas ceased. Today, the oldest inhabited mansions around the world usually began their existence as fortified houses in the Middle Ages. As social conditions slowly changed and stabilised fortifications were able to be reduced, and over the centuries gave way to comfort. It became fashionable and possible for homes to be beautiful rather than grim and forbidding allowing for the development of the modern mansion. In British English, a mansion block refers to a block of flats or apartments designed for the appearance of grandeur. In many parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Japan, the word mansion also refers to a block of apartments. In modern Japan, a \\"manshon\\" („Éû„É≥„Ç∑„Éß„É≥), stemming from the English word \\"mansion\\", is used to refer to a multi-unit apartment complex or condominium. In Europe, from the 15th century onwards, a combination of politics and advancements in modern weaponry negated the need for the aristocracy to live in fortified castles. As a result, many were transformed into mansions without defences or demolished and rebuilt in a more modern, undefended style. Due to intermarriage and primogeniture inheritance amongst the aristocracy, it became common for one noble to often own several country houses. These would be visited rotationally throughout the year as their owner pursued the social and sporting circuit from country home to country home. Many owners of a country house would also own a town mansion in their country's capital city. These town mansions were referred to as 'houses' in London, 'h√¥tels particuliers' in Paris, and 'palaces' in most European cities elsewhere. It might be noted that sometimes the house of a clergyman was called a \\"mansion house\\" (e.g., by the Revd James Blair, Commissary in Virginia for the Bishop of London, 1689‚Äì1745, a term related to the word \\"manse\\" commonly used in the Church of Scotland and in Non-Conformist churches. H.G. Herklots, The Church of England and the American Episcopal Church). Harlaxton Manor, England, a 19th-century meeting of Renaissance, Tudor and Gothic architecture produced Jacobethan ‚Äì a popular form of historicist mansion architecture. As the 16th century progressed and the Renaissance style slowly spread across Europe, the last vestiges of castle architecture and life changed; the central points of these great houses became redundant as owners wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house into distant wings, while the owners began to live in airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to their specifically delegated areas‚Äîoften the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change, as the educated prided themselves on enlightenment. The uses of these edifices paralleled that of the Roman villas. It was vital for powerful people and families to keep in social contact with each other as they were the primary moulders of society. The rounds of visits and entertainments were an essential part of the societal process, as painted in the novels of Jane Austen. State business was often discussed and determined in informal settings. Times of revolution reversed this value. During July/August 1789, a significant number of French country mansions (chateaux) were destroyed by the rural population as part of the Great Fear‚Äîa symbolic rejection of the feudal rights and restraints in effect under the Ancien R√©gime.Richard Cobb, pages 77‚Äì79, The French Revolution: Voices from a Momentous Epoch, CN8039, Guild Publishing 1988 Until World War I it was not unusual for a moderately sized mansion in England such as Cliveden to have an indoor staff of 20 and an outside staff of the same size, and in ducal mansions such as Chatsworth House the numbers could be far higher. In the great houses of Italy, the number of retainers was often even greater than in England; whole families plus extended relations would often inhabit warrens of rooms in basements and attics. Most European mansions were also the hub of vast estates. 19th-century development Renaissance Revival style, The Breakers in Newport, Rhode Island, is one of the best known 19th-century mansions in the United States. The 19th century saw the continuation of the building of mansions in the United States and Europe. Built by self-made men, these were often smaller than those built by the old European aristocracy. These new builders of mansions did not confine themselves to just the then- fashionable Gothic tastes in architecture, but also experimented with 19th- century versions of older Renaissance and Tudoresque styles; The Breakers in Rhode Island is a fine example of American Renaissance revivalism. During the 19th century, like the major thoroughfares of all important cities, Fifth Avenue in New York City, was lined with mansions. Many of these were designed by the leading architects of the day, often in European Gothic Revival style, and were built by families who were making their fortunes, and thus achieving their social aspirations. However, nearly all of these have now been demolished, thus depriving New York of a boulevard to rival, in the architectural sense, those in Paris, London or Rome‚Äîwhere the many large mansions and palazzi built or remodeled during this era still survive. Mansions built in the countryside were not spared either. One of the most spectacular estates of the U.S., Whitemarsh Hall, was demolished in 1980, along with its extensive gardens, to make way for suburban developments. Grand Federal style mansions designed by Samuel McIntire inhabit an area that, in 2012, is the largest collection of 17th- and 18th-century structures in the United States of America. This district in Salem, Massachusetts, is called the McIntire Historic District with the center being Chestnut Street. McIntire's training came from his father and from books. He and his brothers, Joseph and Angler, began their careers as housewrights and carpenters while in their teens but, early on, Samuel's work caught the eye of Salem's pre-eminent merchant, Elias Hasket Derby. Over the next quarter century, McIntire built or remodelled a number of homes for Derby and members of his extended family. McIntire also worked occasionally on Derby's vessels, and wasn't averse to fixing a wagon or building a birdhouse if his patron so desired. Hamilton Hall is a National Historic Landmark at 9 Chestnut Street in Salem, Massachusetts. Hamilton Hall was built in 1805 by Samuel McIntire and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. \\"King\\" Derby's stamp of approval opened many other doors for McIntire, who went on to design and build mansions for John Gardner, Jerethmiel Peirce, Simon Forrester, and other wealthy Salem shipowners. He also built, on elegant Chestnut Street, a function hall (named for Alexander Hamilton) and church for the town's merchant class. McIntire also designed the former Salem Court House and Registry of Deeds. After 1793, Samuel McIntire worked exclusively in the architectural style developed by Robert Adam in Great Britain and brought to America by the great Boston architect, Charles Bulfinch. The delicate Adam style, which emphasized decorative elements and ornamentation, was tailor-made for McIntire, whose unerring sense of design and proportion was exceeded only by his skill as a woodcarver. Carved swags, rosettes, garlands, and his signature sheaths of wheat dominate wood surfaces in McIntire homes built between 1793 and his death in 1811. Palladian inspired Zonnebeek (1907), Enschede, Netherlands Even in Europe, some 19th-century mansions were often built as replicas of older houses, the Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res in France was inspired by Mentmore Towers, which in turn is a copy of Wollaton Hall. Other mansions were built in the new and innovative styles of the new era such as the arts and crafts style: The Breakers is a pastiche of an Italian Renaissance palazzo; Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire is a faithful mixture of various French ch√¢teaux. One of the most enduring and most frequently copied styles for a mansion is the Palladian ‚Äì particularly so in the 18th century. However, the Gothic style was probably the most popular choice of design in the 19th century. The most bizarre example of this was probably Fonthill Abbey which actually set out to imitate the mansions which had truly evolved from medieval Gothic abbeys following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. Mansions built during and after the 19th century were seldom supported by the large estates of their predecessors. These new mansions were often built as the week-end retreats of businessmen who commuted to their offices by the new railways, which enabled them to leave the city more easily. Latin America The Quinta Gameros is a Porfirian-era mansion located in Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico. The building, designed in a French style, is testimony to an era when France asserted greater soft power in the region than either Spain or Portugal. In Latin America, the grand rural estate, the Hacienda, Estancia, in Portuguese speaking Brazil Fazenda or Est√¢ncia, with the mansion as its stately center, is a characteristic feature. Mansions tended to follow European architectural styles. Whereas until the second half of the 19th century, Portugal and Spain as the colonial (or former colonial) powers were the eminent models for architecture and upper-class lifestyle, towards the end of the 19th century they were sometimes replaced by then more dominant powers like France or England. In comparably developed, densely populated countries like Mexico, feudal estates and their mansions were as grand and stately as in the Mediterranean old world, whereas where estates were founded in the sparsely populated remote areas like the Pampa of Argentina or Uruguay, where iron pillars, doors, windows, and furniture had to be brought from Europe by ship and afterwards ox cart, buildings were smaller, but normally still aspiring to evoke a stately impression, often featuring, like their earlier Italian counterparts, a morador. In Venezuela, the traditional Spanish mansions with a garden in the center of the property are usually referred as \\"Quinta\\". Modern mansions Eaton Hall, England, the Duke of Westminster's 20th-century country house stands alongside the remains of its 19th-century predecessor. Mansions built during the 20th and 21st centuries usually have specially designed rooms meant to accommodate leisure activities of a particular kind. Many will have a conservatory or greenhouse, while others will have an infinity pool or a home theater. Some have all of these features. The relative importance of these specially designed rooms changes with the times. At the beginning of the 20th century, no true mansion would have been built without a room to house a private library or study, while at the beginning of the 21st century the presence of a room designed for a home theater or cinema is normal. Most recently, mansions have been built with integrated home automation. Some other technology-inclined mansions may even have a bowling alley or a server room. A modern mansion today may not necessarily be limited to a single house standing alone, but like Roman Emperor Nero's Domus Aurea, mansions may be compounds or a grouping of larger houses. The Kennedy Compound is an example of one family building surrounded by large houses on a single plot. In general, whether a house can be called a mansion is contextual‚Äîin Manhattan or many cities a house would certainly be described as such, but a similar-sized house in the Atlanta suburbs probably would not. Calling a dwelling a mansion indicates a level of grandeur and consumption considerably greater than the norm in that location, with the additional connotation of quality, and correlates highly with the housing patterns of the upper class.

In professional wrestling, a gimmick generally refers to a wrestler's in-ring persona, character, behaviour, attire and/or other distinguishing traits while performing which are usually artificially created in order to draw fan interest. These in-ring personalities often involve costumes, makeup and catchphrases that they shout at their opponents or the fans. Gimmicks can be designed to work as good guys (babyfaces) or villains (heels) depending on the wrestler's desire to be popular or hated by the crowd. A tweener gimmick falls between the two extremes. A wrestler may portray more than one gimmick over their career depending on the angle or the wrestling promotion that they are working for at that time. Promotions will use gimmicks on more than one person, albeit at different times, occasionally taking advantage of a masked character which allows for the identity of the wrestler in question to be concealed. Razor Ramon was portrayed by both Scott Hall and Rick Bognar. Occasionally, a wrestler uses a gimmick as a tribute to another worker; such is the case of Ric Flair's Nature Boy persona which he took on as an homage to the original Nature Boy, Buddy Rogers. When a wrestler acts outside his or her gimmick this is known as 'breaking kayfabe', a term showing pro wrestling's linkages to theatre, where the more common term \\"breaking the fourth wall\\" is used. Gimmicks are annually rated for the Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards by the publication's owner, professional wrestling journalists, and various industry insiders, such as Dave Meltzer, promoters, agents and performers, other journalists, historians, and fans. The two awards are given to the best and worst gimmick of that year. Current winners are \\"The Fiend\\" Bray Wyatt and Shorty G respectively. History Photo postcard of Gorgeous George, one of pro wrestling's first modern gimmicks = Beginnings (1860s to 1940s) = Pro wrestling's history has been tied to the use of gimmicks from its infancy. From its circus origins in the 1830s, showmen presented wrestlers under names such as ‚ÄúEdward, the steel eater‚Äù, ‚ÄúGustave d‚ÄôAvignon, the bone wrecker‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBonnet, the ox of the low Alps‚Äù and challenged the public to knock them down for 500 francs. During the late 19th century-early 20th century, when wrestler Frank Gotch rose to prominence, the focus became on contests largely legitimate (see catch wrestling), which largely resulted in the abandoning previous character gimmicks. = Television era (1950s to 1970s) = It was not until the First Golden Age of Professional Wrestling in the United States during the 1940s‚Äì1950s, when Gorgeous George created pro wrestling's first major gimmick. His heel character focused on his looks and quickly antagonized the fans with his exaggerated effeminate behavior. Such showmanship was unheard of for the time; and consequently, arena crowds grew in size as fans turned out to ridicule George. Gorgeous George's impact and legacy on wrestling gimmicks was enormous, demonstrating how fast television changed the product from athletics to performance. Before him, wrestlers gimmicks imitated \\"ethnic terrors\\" (Nazis, Arabs, etc.), but his success birthed a more individualistic and narcissist form of character. He was one of the first pro- wrestlers to use entrance music, \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" which always played as he made his way to the ring. In Britain, television took British wrestling to the next level when in 1964, it went full-time as part of the World of Sport show. The style of wrestling at the time was unique with strong emphasis on clean technical wrestling. Heels made up a minority of the roster, with most shows containing an abnormally high proportion of clean sportsmanly matches between two \\"blue-eyes\\" (as faces were known backstage in the UK). This would remain the case for several decades to come. Gimmick matches were a rarity, midget wrestling failed to catch on, while women were banned by the Greater London Council until the late 1970s. = Explosion (1980‚Äìpresent) = SummerSlam in 2005 During the Second Golden Age of pro wrestling in the 1980s‚Äì1990s a rise of cartoonish, outlandish gimmicks became popular with the increase of the World Wrestling Federation's popularity. The WWF contributed to the explosion of gimmicks by becoming the most colorful and well-known wrestling brand because of its child-oriented characters, soap opera dramatics and cartoon-like personas. Most notable was the muscular Hulk Hogan, who marked the 1980s with his \\"all-American\\" gimmick and made his main events into excellent ratings draws. His dominant role in the industry at that time led to this era to be also known as \\"Hulkamania\\". Around this time, wrestling became a form of entertainment rather than an official sport. Other wrestlers from this era with similarly outlandish characterization include Ric Flair, Sting and The Undertaker. In recent years, the emphasis has been on more realistic gimmicks that portray the wrestler as an actual person, sometimes using their real names, albeit with exaggerated personality traits. Wrestlers like Randy Orton, Batista, and John Cena are prime examples of this.  Common gimmicks  =Related to origin= Exaggerating the characteristics of a wrestler's (on occasion fabricated) origin is one of the most commonly exploited gimmicks, in which overarching characteristics of a character play up to clich√©s and stereotypes. Abdullah the Butcher created his Arabian sadist gimmick, but he was actually born in Canada A long list of wrestlers in this category includes: African (Kamala, Abdullah The Butcher), American (The Patriot, Hulk Hogan, 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan, Jack Swagger), Bulgarian (Rusev), Canadian (Team Canada (TNA), Team Canada (WCW)), Cowboy (Bob Orton Jr.), English (William Regal, Lord Alfred Hayes, Gentleman Jack Gallagher), French (La R√©sistance), Irish (Finlay, Sheamus), Iranian (The Iron Sheik, Ariya Daivari), Hawaiian (Leilani Kai, Ricky Steamboat), Indian (The Great Khali, Jinder Mahal), Italian (Santino Marella), Jamaican (Kofi Kingston), Japanese (Mr. Fuji, Kai En Tai) Korean (Gail Kim), Mexican (Alberto Del Rio, Eddie Guerrero, The Mexicools), Native American/American Indian (Chief Jay Strongbow, Tatanka), Russian (Vladimir Kozlov, Nikolai Volkoff, Lana), Samoan (Samoa Joe, The Wild Samoans), Scottish (Drew McIntyre, Roddy Piper) Swiss (Cesaro), and Thai (Super Invader). The undeniable influence of the Puroresu style in the world of professional wrestling has resulted in many wrestlers using fabricated Japanese origins or being billed from a Japanese city, without actually being natives of the country. Prime examples of this include Yokozuna, Awesome Kong, Hawaiians Professor Tanaka and Mr. Fuji, and British wrestler Kendo Nagasaki. Several Japanese wrestlers who wrestle outside of their home country are known to play up or exaggerate aspects of their cultural heritage as part of their gimmicks for an overseas audience. =Masked= Mil M√°scaras was the first masked wrestler to perform at Madison Square Garden Masked wrestlers made their appearance in Europe (Theobaud Bauer in France, 1865) and the United States (Mort Henderson as \\"Masked Marvel\\" in 1915) considerably earlier than in Mexico, but it was the latter that popularised the use of masks. This, in some cases to signify a high-flyer style, influenced by Lucha Libre. A specific masked gimmick may be used by more than one wrestler at a wrestling company's request since their identity can be permanently concealed. This is the case of Mexican Sin Cara and Japanese Tiger Mask. Masks also allow a wrestler to perform as more than one character for a variety of wrestling promotions. Other wrestlers that have used masks in their performances include: Mexican-Americans Rey Misterio, Big Van Vader, or Japanese legend Jyushin Thunder Liger. =Sports= A high number of wrestlers who start their careers in another sport incorporate their athletic abilities as part of their act. That is the case for Olympic medallist Kurt Angle, who previously competed in freestyle wrestling and alludes to it in his attire and wrestling style. Brock Lesnar is also an ex- amateur wrestler, NFL player and UFC champion. Former MMA fighters Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler also uses their MMA background as part of their characters. =Superheros and comic characters= Sting's gimmick alteration in the mid-1990s was influenced by The Crow The theatrical nature of Professional Wrestling easily blends with comic hero characters, made popular in the 1980s by legend The Ultimate Warrior and Sting, whose character was inspired by the 1994 movie The Crow, based on the comic book of the same name. Other wrestlers with superhero gimmicks include late WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes' sons Gold and Stardust, Samoan Rosey during his \\"the Super Hero in Training\\" (the S.H.I.T.) phase and his tag-team partner The Hurricane and valet Stacy Keibler. Some of these characters are brought during very short periods of time for entertainment value. The Joker and Harley Quinn from the Batman comics have inspired wrestling attire for Sting and Alexa Bliss respectively. Finn B√°lor's Demon King persona is visually based on Spider-Man villains Venom and Carnage. =Supernatural= Wrestling Observer Newsletter awarded The Undertaker its Best Gimmick award a record four times Similarly to superheroes, supernatural characters add to entertainment value. Most famously in this category is The Undertaker, considered one of the most respected wrestlers in the business, whose gimmick is a horror-themed character of an undead, macabre and paranormal dark presence prone to scare tactics. He was managed by the ghostly character that was Paul Bearer and tagged with his half-brother Kane in The Brothers of Destruction stable. Other wrestlers displaying supposed supernatural powers include Matt Hardy (as his Broken/Woken persona), Bray Wyatt, Mordecai, Papa Shango, and The Boogeyman. Japanese Onryo portrays a dead wrestler who returned for vengeance. The Brood was a vampire stable, composed of Gangrel, Christian and Edge. =Juggernaut= Since its beginnings in the circus circuit, the professional wrestler's stereotype has been that of large, powerful and strong. Various wrestlers have banked on the larger size which has influenced their in-ring style and persona. Notable examples of these kind include Swede Tor Johnson (181 kg), Big Show (7 ft 2 in), Andr√© the Giant (7 ft 4 in), The Great Khali (7 ft 3 in), Gorilla Monsoon (182 kg), Awesome Kong (123 kg) and Big Boss Man (6 ft 6 in). =Comedy= Doink the Clown is a comedic gimmick that has been used by several wrestlers Whilst humor has long been present in professional wrestling matches and many wrestlers incorporate elements of comedy in their act, full-on comedic gimmicks are not commonly seen. These are sometimes reserved for wrestlers who not always have the stereotypical physique required in the industry and instead exploit their entertainment abilities. Wrestlers who fall under this category are Scottish comedian and actor Grado, Doink The Clown which was majorly portrayed by Matt Osborne until 2013, Ring of Honor's Colt Cabana, Santino Marella, Japanese Wrestlers Stalker Ichikawa, Gran Naniwa and Kuishinbo Kamen, Charlie Haas during his impersonations run, and WWE's 1990s turkey character Gobbledy Gooker. Damien Sandow also falls under this category due to his 'stunt double' gimmick in late 2014 where he copied whatever his on-screen mentor The Miz did, due to the latter using a gimmick of an arrogant movie star. =Self-absorbed= Usually a villainous gimmick, initiated by Gorgeous George. Wrestlers that followed on with this trend include Bobby Roode, Ravishing Rick Rude, Rick Martel, TNA's Mr Pec-tacular, Curt Hennig's Mr Perfect, NXT's Tyler Breeze and women's tag team The Beautiful People. =Music= Music influences are another popular choice for gimmicks, as demonstrated by John Cena's original rapper character, CM Punk's straight edge iconoclast hardcore punk, party boy Adam Rose, Chris Jericho, The Honky Tonk Man, Disco Inferno, Brodus Clay and his fun-loving, funk dancing gimmick \\"The Funkasaurus\\" and WWE's Fandango who includes salsa dancing in his routine. =Evil billionaire/Tyrant= WWE promoter Vince McMahon regularly portrayed a heel onscreen authority figure The millionaire tyrant character works well as a villain in contrast to professional wrestling's working-class fan-base. It is because of this audience that Dusty Rhodes' Common Man was highly successful with the crowds. The original gimmick of this type was created by \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase which consequently inspired wrestlers like Mr. McMahon, Tiger Ali Singh, JBL and most recently Alberto Del Rio's arrogant rich Mexican aristocrat character.  Other usage  *Within professional wrestling in insider usage the word 'gimmick' has come to refer to an array of other related terms, including any weapon or foreign object used during a match or the scripted quality of a match. *In backstage lingo, gimmick is also a stand-in for basically any physical noun or set of moves in a match. *Gimmicked is used to describe an object that is altered or rigged for use in a match. For example, a gimmicked table or chair which would be precut or made to fall apart more easily. *The term is also a euphemism for hormone-enhancing drugs, namely steroids and growth hormone, which have historically been linked to the sport. *It has also been used by people in the profession to describe casual marijuana use, as wrestlers will refer to 'smoking the gimmick'.

For Macintosh developers, it was one of the primary tools for building applications for System 7.x and Mac OS 8.x and 9.x. Initially MPW was available for purchase as part of Apple's professional developers program, but Apple made it a free download after it was superseded by CodeWarrior. On Mac OS X it was replaced by the Project Builder IDE, which eventually became Xcode.  Design  MPW provided a command line environment and tools, including 68k and PowerPC assemblers as well as Pascal, C and C++ compilers. The shell environment is somewhat similar to Unix shells in design, but is designed around the Macintosh's character set and GUI, replacing the usual terminal environment with a \\"worksheet\\" interface, allowing the user to select and run arbitrary sections of a shell script or to redo commands with no retyping. In addition, command line tools were commonly provided with a somewhat standardized graphical interface named Commando that provided limited access to the command line capabilities of the program. The debuggers were not integrated into MPW like most IDEs of today but the language compilers supported the symbolic debugging information file format used by the debugger. MPW supported a source-level debugger called SADE (Symbolic Application Debugging Environment). SADE was not an MPW Tool, but ran as a separate application with a user interface similar to MPW. Apple's compilers had some features that were not common on other platforms--for example, the Pascal compiler was object-oriented, while the C and C++ compilers included support for length-prefixed strings (needed for Pascal-oriented APIs). Pascal was Apple's original preferred language for Macintosh software development, and MPW was initially released with only Pascal support. A C compiler was released with MPW 2.0. The MPW C compiler was written under contract for Apple by Greenhills. In addition, the original MPW C compiler was known for its casual and frequently humorous error messages (\\"we already did this function\\"),MPW C Error Messages, May 15, 1994 - Robert Lentz as well as occasionally addressing users by name. These quirks were not carried on after the PowerPC transition, when Apple replaced the originals with compilers written by Symantec. Pascal support was no longer provided by the mid-90s due to declining popularity of the language. MPW was always targeted to a professional audience and was seldom used by hobbyist developers due to the considerable price for the package; by the time it was made freeware it had long since been superseded by offerings from Symantec and Metrowerks, as well as Apple's own development tools inherited from NeXT and distributed for free with OS X. It was also occasionally available as a wrapper environment for third-party compilers, a practice used by both Metrowerks and Absoft among others. Apple has officially discontinued further development of MPW and the last version of OS X to run it is 10.4 'Tiger', the last one to support the Classic environment. Apple maintained a web site and mailing lists that supported the software long after its discontinuation, but that site now redirects to the Xcode page. MPW Shell The MPW Shell featured redirection of output to files, as well as to windows. If a file were open, the output would go to the file and to the open window. This redirection of output required significant patching out of the file system calls so that tools need not do anything special to inherit this feature: the MPW Shell did all of the work. The MPW Shell command language was based on the Unix csh language, but was extended to support the main features of the Macintosh GUI. It had simple commands to create menus, dialogs (prompts), and new shell windows. The cursor could be controlled, and MPW scripts or tools could easily be attached to a menu item. Command key shortcuts could be specified. Window size and location could be controlled. These features were popular in commercial production environments, where complicated build and packaging processes were all controlled by elaborate scripts. The shell had some important differences from its Unix counterparts. For instance, the classic Mac OS had nothing comparable to Unix fork(), so MPW tools were effectively called as subroutines of the shell; only one could be running at any one time, and tools could not themselves run other tools. These limitations were the inspiration for the MacRelix project, a \\"Unix-like system\\" for classic Mac OS. =Look and feel= Functionally, a worksheet is a cross between a text editor document and an xterm window. Each worksheet window is persistently bound to a file. The user may type anything anywhere in the window, including commands, which can be executed via the keyboard's Enter key; command output appears at the insertion point. Unlike an xterm window, an MPW worksheet is always in visual editing mode and can be freely reorganized by its user. Hence a worksheet can be purely a command script or purely a text document or a mixture of the two--an integrated document describing the history, maintenance procedures and test results of a software project. The commercial BBEdit text editor retains a feature it calls \\"shell worksheets\\" on Mac OS X. The Emacs text editor provides shell buffers, a similar feature that works across platforms. Other tools MPW included a version of make. Its syntax was conceptually similar to that of Unix make, but the MacRoman long f character to indicate dependencies. More significantly, since the limitations of the shell precluded the make program from running tools itself, it had to work by composing a script of compile/link actions to be run, then delivering that to the shell for execution. While this was good enough most of the time, it precluded makefiles that could make on-the-fly decisions based on the results of a previous action. Although not implemented as MPW tools, the package also came with several source-level debuggers through its history; SourceBug and SADE (Symbolic Application Debugging Environment) were used on MC680x0 systems, while the Power Mac Debugger (known during development as R2DbShort for RISC 2-machine Debugger; http://www.mactech.com/articles/develop/issue_17/Falk_Topping_final.html) provided both local and remote debugging services for PowerPC systems, the latter by using a server program known as a \\"debugger nub\\" on the computer being debugged. Writing MPW tools MPW included a set of standard C libraries sufficient for developers to build their own MPW tools. Many Unix utilities could be ported with little change. One point of difficulty was the Mac OS newline convention, which was different from Unix. Another was the pathname separator, \\":\\" in Mac OS, but many Unix utilities assumed \\"/\\". Many Unix utilities also assumed pathnames would not have embedded spaces, a common practice on Macs. For a number of years, the GNU toolchain included portability support for MPW as part of libiberty. This was used to support MPW-hosted cross-compilers used by General Magic and several other developers. History MPW was started in late 1985 by Rick Meyers, Jeff Parrish, and Dan Smith (now Dan Keller). It was going to be called the Macintosh Programmer's System, or MPS. (Notice that coincidentally the three last names start with MPS.) 'MPS ' has always been the creator signature of the MPW Shell as a result of this. Since MPW was to be the successor to the Lisa Workshop, they decided to rename it the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop. Before the arrival of MPW, Mac applications had to be cross-developed on a Lisa. The MPW Pascal compiler is descended from the Lisa Pascal compiler. Apple's Larry Tesler worked with Niklaus Wirth to come up with Object Pascal extensions which Ken Doyle incorporated in one of the last versions of the Lisa Pascal compiler. This enabled MacApp. Early contributors included Rick Meyers (project lead and MPW Shell command interpreter), Jeff Parrish (MPW Shell editor), Dan Smith (MPW Shell commands), Ira Ruben (assembler and many of the tools including Backup, PasMat, and more), Fred Forsman (Make, Print, SADE, and assembler macro processor), Al Hoffman (Pascal compiler) Roger Lawrence (Pascal and C compilers, including the error messages), Ken Friedenbach (linker), Johan Strandberg (Rez, DeRez, RezDet), Steve Hartwell (C libraries), and Dan Allen (MacsBug, editor). The Apple Numerics Group also contributed math libraries. MPW 1.0 was completed on September 24, 1986. A shell memory leak was fixed on October 10, 1986, and MPW 1.0.1 was born. MPW 2.0 was completed on July 20, 1987, and MPW 3.0 was done November 30, 1988. MPW 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 came in the next few years. MPW 3.4 was completed July 14, 1995, and MPW 3.5 was done December 17, 1999. MPW 3.6 was under development when work was halted in late 2001. During MPW's twilight years, Greg Branche supported MPW unofficially through the Apple MPW-dev mailing list. The list, and the lists.apple.com server that hosted it, was planned to be shut down January 17, 2014, a decision that was later reversed. Legacy MPW can still be used to develop for Mac OS X, but support is limited to Carbon applications for PowerPC-based computers. To develop Mac OS X applications based on other technologies, one must use either Xcode or another OS X-compatible development environment. MPW also included a version control system called Projector; this has been superseded by modern version control systems and is no longer supported in Mac OS X.

Victor Garber was thrice nominated for an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Jack, and fans voted the relationship between Sydney and Jack the best non-romantic relationship on the show in the 2005 AllAlias.com Fans' Choice Awards. Character biography Jack Bristow, a longtime agent of the CIA and former double officer with SD-6, is often emotionally distant and can be among the show's coldest and most brutal characters. However, his character's defining trait is his devotion to the safety of his daughter, Sydney. He is highly protective of her and is willing to do anything - torture, kill, even betray his country - to ensure her well- being. His relationship with his daughter has always been problematic, although it warmed and matured as the show unfolded. According to background information provided in the official Alias magazine, Jack Bristow is originally from Canada (reflecting the fact that actor Victor Garber is Canadian). A screenshot in a fourth-season episode showed a laptop referring to his birth in London, Ontario. Jack's granddaughter Isabelle was also born in Canada, on a mission in Vancouver. Prior to the events of the series, Jack fathered Sydney with Irina Derevko, a long-term KGB spy who married Jack to get close to the CIA, specifically to steal the details of Project Christmas, which Jack was developing for the Agency. She took the name Laura Bristow and built a cover as an English literature professor. Once the FBI started to investigate against Irina, she faked her death in a staged car accident. Jack, suspected of being complicit in Irina's espionage, was detained and placed in solitary confinement. He named Arvin and Emily Sloane as Sydney's guardians. Jack and Arvin became friends after they got to know each other in the early seventies, when both started their careers at the CIA. When Jack was finally cleared, he began drinking heavily and became more of an absentee father, leaving Sydney to be raised by nannies. About ten years later, Jack was recruited into SD-6 by Sloane when the Alliance of Twelve was founded, and was one of the few agents who knew the truth behind the cell. He was also Director of Operations at SD-6, and many in the Alliance believed he was a logical choice to take Sloane's place. When Sydney was in college, Arvin Sloane had her recruited into SD-6 without Jack's knowledge. Jack reacted negatively to Sydney's telling him that she had gotten a job at Credit Dauphine, the front company for SD-6. However, Jack's reaction made Sydney more determined to be a part of the \\"CIA\\". Jack later revealed to Sydney that he had recognized her potential, but wanted to keep her away from this life, away from making the choices that he had to and eventually she had to as an agent. Sydney's recruitment into SD-6 also ended Jack's friendship with Sloane, although, because of the clandestine nature of Jack's work as a double-agent at SD-6, he couldn't reveal that to Sloane until years after. Several years later when Sydney herself becomes a double agent for the real CIA, she discovers that her father has long been in the same position and they learn to work together to bring down SD-6. Jack often used his position as Sloane's chief of operations to structure missions to the CIA's advantage. When Irina Derevko makes her reappearance in Season 2, Jack must also deal with his unresolved feelings of love and bitterness towards her while continuing to perform his job at SD-6 and the CIA. With SD-6's destruction, Jack found himself finally able to grow closer to his daughter. Sydney learns in season 2 that Jack subjected her to Project Christmas, a project that trained and hardwired potential spies. Sydney initially believed that this programming had taken away her choices in life, but in Season 3 discovers that it had, in fact, protected her autonomy and made her immune to brainwashing by the Covenant. During Sydney's two year disappearance between Seasons 2 and 3, Jack was again taken into custody, held in solitary confinement for a year because of his working with unsanctioned sources (including Irina) to learn the truth behind Sydney's apparent death. During Season 3, Jack acts as a far more supportive father-figure to Sydney, in response to her depression and emotional isolation during that season. At the start of Season 4, Sydney learns that Jack killed Irina. Even though he did it because Irina had hired a hit man to kill Sydney, his action causes yet another rift to form between Jack and his daughter, a rift aggravated when both agents are recruited by Sloane into the new CIA black ops agency, Authorized Personnel Only (APO). By the second half of the season, this rift has begun to heal. Jack Bristow contracts radiation poisoning during the events of the fourth-season episode \\"Nightingale\\" when he entered a radioactive area in order to save Sydney's life during a mission. He initially keeps his condition a secret from his APO colleagues except for Marshall (who figures it out and confronts Jack, although Marshall later revealed it to Sydney). Bristow is seen consulting with a doctor who tells him the condition is terminal. Not accepting this prognosis, Jack begins a painful regimen of blood filtering treatments in order to delay the inevitable, and appeared to be experiencing memory loss related to medication; he is also puzzled by the appearance of a mysterious implant in his hand, which his doctor said was designed to regulate the anti-radiation medication. Jack's doctor and indeed his entire treatment regimen turn out to be hallucinations, and that Jack, his mind affected by the radiation, had been injecting himself with a poison. Further investigation by APO reveals that the hallucinated doctor actually exists. He was a scientist who had developed an experimental treatment for radiation sickness. In the early 1980s, Jack had helped the man escape to Scandinavia. Sydney impersonates Irina to get Jack to reveal the doctor's whereabouts; the man is located and begins a genuine treatment regimen for Jack. During the impersonation, Sydney learned that her father had planned to leave the CIA in order to be a better parent to her and would have done so if her mother had not been revealed as a KGB agent. This did much to assuage Sydney's longstanding concerns about her importance in her father's life. Jack learns near the end of the fourth season that he had not in fact killed Irina, but had shot a genetically engineered impostor. He subsequently reunited with Irina, who chastised him for being so quick to rush to judgment about her, yet also said that she understood why he had acted to protect Sydney. Following Irina's help in foiling the end game of her sister Elena, Jack decides to let Irina go rather than return her to federal prison. Husband and wife parted with a kiss. In Season 5, Sydney is expecting her first child. In the absence of Michael Vaughn, the child's father, Jack attends doctor's visits with Sydney and helps her to assemble a crib for his grandchild's nursery. However, he is distracted by the presence of Arvin Sloane within APO, a presence he (as the new director of the black ops unit) has authorized; Sloane's behavior appears dishonest, and although Sloane has admitted some of his lies, Jack remains on his guard. Jack becomes a grandfather when Irina and he assist Sydney in delivering her daughter, Isabelle. In the final episode, Jack, Vaughn (recently returned from hiding) and Sydney mount an assault on Rambaldi's tomb in Mongolia where Sloane is in the process of activating The Horizon. Jack and Vaughn are captured by Sark, and when Sydney refuses to surrender The Horizon, Sloane shoots Jack. In retaliation, Sydney shoots Sloane, apparently to death. Critically wounded, Jack is taken outside and insists that Sydney leave him and go to Hong Kong in order to stop the final player in Rambaldi's endgame - Irina - and his daughter reluctantly obeys. Later, he somehow obtains a belt of explosives and struggles back into the tomb, where Sloane, who has apparently become immortal, has been revived. Telling Sloane, \\"You beat death, Arvin. But you couldn't beat me\\", Jack detonates the explosives, killing himself, sealing the tomb and burying Sloane alive. The episode ends with a flash forward in which Sydney and Vaughn, several years in the future, have named their second child Jack in his honor. Reception In 2004, TV Guide ranked him # 29 on its \\"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\\" list.

His full name and titles were Jacques II de Chabannes, Lord of La Palice, of Pacy, of Chauverothe, of Bort-le-Comte and of H√©ron. In 1511, he received the title of Grand Master of France. As a Marshal under Francis I, he fought against Italian armies, and died during the battle of Pavia. Biography He was born at Lapalisse, Auvergne. At 15, La Palice entered the service of King Charles VIII of France, of his same age. His first battle was that of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (1488). Four years later he married Jeanne de Montb√©ron, daughter of chamberlain Eustache de Montb√©ron. In 1494 he followed the king in war for the Kingdom of Naples, taking part in the latter city's capture in 1495, as well as in the battle of Fornovo (1498) against the Italian League, which allowed the French army to retreat in their homeland. After Charles' death, La Palice accompanied the new King, Louis XII, in the campaign for Milan, which the French captured in 1499. He conquered several lands in the Abruzzi and in Apulia, being created viceroy of Abruzzo in 1502. However, he was defeated in the battle of Ruvo di Puglia (1503) and made prisoner by Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. He was freed in 1504, the same year his wife died. In 1507 he commanded the French vanguard in the siege of Genoa, during which he was seriously wounded. In 1509 the war of the League of Cambrai against the Republic of Venice broke out. La Palice took part in the siege of Treviglio and in the victorious battle of Agnadello; he was then made commander-in-chief of the French troops in Lombardy and, sent to help Emperor Maximilian I, he took part against the Venetians in the unsuccessful siege of Padua in 1509. In 1511, after Charles d'Amboise's death, La Palice became the French overall commander in Italy and was made Grand Master of France. After Gaston de Foix's arrival to Italy, La Palice was put under him, successfully relieving Bologna from the Spanish's siege. He took part in the battle of Ravenna (1512), in which de Foix died, being succeeded by La Palice himself as French commander-in-chief. However his slow actions allowed the defeated enemies to recover and expel the French from Lombardy. Returning to France, he was sent to the Pyrenees to rescue John III of Navarre, but soon he was diverted to Th√©rouanne, then the last French possession in the Artois, to counter the English troops. On 6 August 1513, he was defeated and made prisoner at the Battle of the Spurs. After John III's parallel defeat, this marked the end of Louis XII's expansionism. La Palice was dismissed, and retired to his lands, where, in 1514, he married to Marie de Melun, who gave him four children. Louis's successor, Francis I, gave him back the title of Grand Master, adding that of Marshal of France on 2 January 1515. La Palice, under the command of Marshal Aubigny, took part to the invasion of Piedmont, the capture of Villafranca against Prospero Colonna and was one of Francis' lieutenants at the battle of Marignano. After the signing of the Treaty of Noyon which ended the war, La Palice returned to France. La Palice was sent at Calais as negotiator of the peace with Charles V. As the participants did not reach an agreement, he returned to Italy as military leader under Marshal Lautrec, commanding the French main line at the battle of Bicocca (1522), in which he was defeated by Colonna. La Palice was sent again to the Pyrenees, and then to the successful attempt to rescue Marseille from Duke of Bourbon's siege. After the conquest of Avignon, he moved to Milan which had been abandoned by the Spaniards. On 28 October 1524, at the side of his King, La Palice begun the siege of Pavia, defended by Antonio de Leyva. When the Imperial-Spanish army arrived, the battle of Pavia began (24 February 1525). La Palice was captured by German Landsknechte during the fighting, and was executed some time later. Lapalissade La Palice gave his name to the Lapalissade, a comical truism. The coinage originates from la Palice's epitaph, which readsMichel Chabanne (14 June 2007), comment on Encyclop√©die des Expressions: Une v√©rit√© de La Palice / Une lapalissade . Accessed 15 April 2009.Georges Lebouc, 2500 noms propres devenus communs, p. 389 :\\"Ci-g√Æt le Seigneur de La Palice: s'il n'√©tait pas mort, il ferait encore envie.\\" :(\\"Here lies the Seigneur de La Palice: If he weren't dead, he would still be envied.\\") These words were misread (accidentally or intentionally) as \\"...il ≈øerait [serait] encore en vie\\" (\\"...he would still be alive\\"), where the long s favours the confusion. In the 16th century this misreading was incorporated into a popular satirical song, and in time many other variants developed. In the early 18th century Bernard de la Monnoye collected over 50 of these humorous \\"La Palice\\" quatrains, and published them as a burlesque Song of La Palice. From that song came the French term lapalissade meaning an utterly obvious truth--i.e. a truism or tautology.

History A large Bronze Age hoard was found near Meldreth railway station in the nineteenth century that is now in the collections of the British Museum.British Museum Collection The village of Meldreth grew in Saxon times, and the parish is home to Mettle Hill (formerly known as Motlowehyll) that was probably the original meeting place of Armingford Hundred. Listed as Melrede in the Domesday Book of 1086, the village's name means \\"mill stream\\", named after the stream that rises at Melbourn Bury and flows north into the River Rhee.

Phillimore reference: 5,33 Due to its proximity to Cambridge, much of the land has at some time been owned by colleges of the University of Cambridge. In the early 16th century, Christ's College moved to its Meldreth estate to escape the plague. In 1952, the Royal Train carrying King George VI's body passed through the station on its journey from Sandringham to London. Residents gathered on the platform to pay their last respects to the King. The village still has a stocks and whipping post, the traditional medieval punishment, last used in the village in 1860. Church The parish church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity since 1443, consists of a chancel, aisled nave with south porch, and a west tower housing eight bells. More peals have been rung at Holy Trinity than any other church.http://www.cccbr.org.uk/felstead/alltime.php The chancel is unusually long and dates from the 12th century, perhaps indicating the existence of an earlier minster on the site. The tower dates from the late 12th century, with the top stage added in the late 13th century. Village life The village, once famous for its fruit production, is now home to many commuters who work in Cambridge and London. Orchards still exist in Meldreth, and locally grown fruits and vegetables are sold in the village, most notably the Meldreth greengage. The village retains its own railway station which opened in 1851. In 2001, local celebrations marked the 150th anniversary of Meldreth railway station, which serves the residents of Meldreth and the neighbouring village of Melbourn. Trains from the station run into Cambridge and London King's Cross. Only one public house is still open; The British Queen has been open since the first half of the 19th century. The first recorded pub in the village was The Bell (also known as The Old Bell or The Blue Bell Inn) which was housed in a thatched building that was built in 1676 and first recorded as a public house in 1726. The Bell closed in 1910. The Railway Tavern opened in 1858 and closed in 1959. It now houses the Tavern Art Gallery. The Dumb Flea pub in Chiswick End closed in 1956 and is now a private house.http://www.meldrethhistory.org.uk/page_id__47.aspx Other former pubs include The Chequer, recorded in 1785 but believed to have closed soon after, and The Green Man which stood next to the brewery at North End and was open from 1808 till the late 19th century. Meldreth is home to Meldreth Manor School, run by The Aurora Group, as well as home to Meldreth Primary School. The village has a Local Nature Reserve, Melwood. Prime Meridian Prime Meridian marker in Meldreth. The prime meridian runs through the village. A stone marker was erected near the western end of Fenny Lane, and unveiled in December 1999 by the Astronomer Royal, Sir Martin Rees.

Music can express anti-establishment or protest themes, including anti-war songs, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as topical songs. Introduction Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music on a political level. Songs can be used to portray a specific political message. However, there may be barriers to the transmission of such messages; even overtly political songs are often shaped by and reference their contemporary political context, making an understanding of the history and events that inspired the music necessary in order to fully comprehend the message. The nature of that message can also be ambiguous because the label \\"political music\\" can be applied either to songs that merely observe political subjects, songs which offer a partisan opinion, or songs which go further and advocate for specific political action. Thus a distinction has been made, for example, between the use of music as a tool for raising awareness, and music as advocacy. Furthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way Western pop/rock bands such as The Beatles were censored by the State in the Eastern Bloc in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change. This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience, reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy. It is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues. For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that \\"counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers\\", suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that \\"It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically\\". However, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that \\"given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities\\". Recent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, music education has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling patriotism in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive jingoism.Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press Plato wrote: \\"musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;\\" although this was written as a warning it can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but an important movement in the life of all human beings. Folk music =American folk revival= The song \\"We Shall Overcome\\" is perhaps the best-known example of political folk music, in this case a rallying-cry for the US Civil Rights Movement. Pete Seeger was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was Joan Baez. During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and class struggle lead to the growth of the Labour movement and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century \\"Wobblies\\" was Joe Hill. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the Almanac Singers and The Weavers were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. Woody Guthrie's \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie's socialistic patriotism. Pete Seeger's \\"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\\", was a popular anti-war protest song. Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", by Bob Dylan, was a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary, and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation. In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK with \\"There but for Fortune\\" (by Phil Ochs); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies. Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the folk music revival of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Judy Collins, Arlo Guthrie, and others. The folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by Left-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as Sing Out! and Broadside. The revival began in the 1930s and continued after World War II. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions.30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 508 Archivists and artists such as Alan Lomax, Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers. This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support.30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 502 In the UK, Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folkloristLee, CP (2009), 'Like the night: Reception and reaction, Dylan's 1966 UK tour', in: Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan's Road From Minnesota To The World, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis USA, pp. 78‚Äì84. and MacColl (often with Peggy Seeger) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their Communist activism. In the later, post- war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation.30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 522 Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the Cold War era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired. Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, Earl Robinson and Irwin Silber were or had been members of the Communist Party, while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine New Masses), Lee Hays and Paul Robeson were considered fellow travellers. As McCarthyism began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music.30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 520 Artists were blacklisted, denounced by politicians and the media, and in the case of the 1949 Peekskill Riots, subject to mob attack. In general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by rock and roll. However, during the popular folk revival's last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 528 =Contemporary Western folk music= Although public attention shifted to rock music from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 Gracias a la Vida album was a response to events in Chile and included versions of songs by Nueva Canci√≥n Chilena singer- songwriters Violeta Parra and Victor Jara. Paxton albums such as Outward Bound and Morning Again continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as Holly Near, Ray Korona, Charlie King, Anne Feeney, Jim Page, Utah Phillips and more recently David Rovics. In Ireland, the Wolfe Tones is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/rebel music tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by Dominic Behan on albums such as Let the People Sing and Rifles of the I.R.A. Christy Moore has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album Paddy on the Road, produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as Ride On (including \\"Viva la Quinta Brigada\\"), Ordinary Man and various artists LP H Block to which Moore contributed \\"Ninety Miles from Dublin\\", in response to the Republican prisoners' blanket protest of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, The Barleycorn had held the #1 spot on the Irish charts for five weeks in 1972 with their first release \\"The Men Behind the Wire\\", about internment, with all profits going to the families of internees; Republican label R&O; Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album Smash Internment, recorded in Long Kesh, and The Wolfhounds' recording of Paddy McGuigan's \\"The Boys of the Old Brigade\\". In the UK, the Ewan MacColl tradition of political folk has been continued since the 1960s by singer- songwriters such as Roy Bailey, Leon Rosselson and Dick Gaughan. Since the 1980s, a number of artists have blended folk protest with influences from punk and elsewhere to produce topical and political songs for a modern independent rock music audience, including Billy Bragg, Attila the Stockbroker, Robb Johnson, Alistair Hulett, The Men They Couldn't Hang, TV Smith, Chumbawamba and more recently Chris T-T and Grace Petrie. =Folk music around the world= Folk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. Hungary, for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late Cold War era, which was reflected in much of their folk music. During the late twentieth century folk music was crucial in Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.World Music 2002, p. 65 In Communist China, exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim ‚Äì a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe ‚Äì attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent \\"re-education\\". In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.Folk Music of China (1995) by Stephen Jones, page 55 An example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of Edward Lansdale, a CIA chief who dedicated part of his career to counter-insurgency in the Philippines and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government's best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president Ramon Magsaysay, an important US anti- communist ally. In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of 'applied folklore' as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as Ph·∫°m Duy to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the anti-French struggle but then broke with the Communist-dominated Viet Minh. Blues and African-American music Blues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. Bessie Smith recorded protest song \\"Poor Man Blues\\" in 1928. Josh White recorded \\"When Am I Going to be Called a Man\\" in 1936 ‚Äì at this time it was common for white men to address black men as \\"boy\\" ‚Äì before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's Chain Gang and 1941's Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues. Lead Belly's \\"Bourgeois Blues\\" and Big Bill Broonzy's \\"Black, Brown and White\\" (aka \\"Get Back\\") protested racism. Billie Holiday recorded and popularised the song \\"Strange Fruit\\" in 1939. Written by Communist Lewis Allan, and also recorded by Josh White and Nina Simone, it addressed Southern racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including Madison Square Gardens. In the post-war era, J.B. Lenoir gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single \\"Eisenhower Blues\\" due to its title and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War. John Lee Hooker also sang 'I Don't Wanna Go to Vietnam\\" on 1969 album Simply the Truth. Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the FBI and was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for his outspoken political views. The State Department denied Robeson a passport and issued a \\"stop notice\\" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International Peace Arch on the border between Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia on May 18, 1952.Duberman, p. 400 Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,Duberman p. 411 and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled. =Disco= Disco, contrary to popular opinion, originated in Black queer communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the Bronx and other parts of New York. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of \\"absorbing the feeling\\", but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it's important to note that disco, for many, was a \\"form of escape\\" and noted a \\"dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people\\". The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of Vietnam and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another's diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed. The eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities. Rock music Many rock artists, as varied as Roger Waters, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Bruce Springsteen, Little Steven, Rage Against the Machine, Radiohead,https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1134-how-radiohead-became-for-a-time- the-worlds-biggest-political-band/ Manic Street Preachers, Megadeth, Enter Shikari, Architects, Muse, System of a Down, Sonic Boom Six and Drive-By Truckershttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/09/drive-by-truckers- interview-the-unraveling-alabamahave had openly political messages in their music. The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the 1960s counterculture, specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan, itself shaped by the politicised folk revival. =1960s‚Äì70s counterculture= During the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as John Lennon commonly expressed protest themes in their music, for example on the Plastic Ono Band's 1969 single \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". Lennon later devoted an entire album to politics and wrote the song Imagine, widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property. In 1962‚Äì63, Bob Dylan sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the Beat writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era. In turn, while Dylan's political phase comes under the 'folk' category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti- establishment stance that influenced other musicians ‚Äì such as the British Invasion bands ‚Äì and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song. The MC5 (Motor City 5) came out of the Detroit, Michigan underground scene of the late 1960s, and embodied an aggressive evolution of garage rock which was often fused with socio- political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs \\"Motor City Is Burning\\", (a John Lee Hooker cover adapting the story of the Detroit Race Riot (1943) to the 1967 12th Street Detroit Riot), and \\"American Ruse\\" (which discusses U.S. police brutality as well as pollution, prison, materialism and rebellion). They had ties to radical leftist groups such as Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers and John Sinclair's White Panther Party. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the August 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, as part of the Yippies' Festival of Life where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the April assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Vietnam War. Other rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s ‚Äì often in regard to the Vietnam War ‚Äì include The Fugs, Country Joe and the Fish, Jefferson Airplane, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Third World War, while some bands, such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Hawkwind, referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like \\"Revolution\\", \\"Street Fighting Man\\", \\"Salt of the Earth\\" and \\"Urban Guerrilla\\". =Punk rock= Notable punk rock bands, such as Crass, Conflict, Sex Pistols, The Clash, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, Refused, American Standards, Discharge, MDC, Aus-Rotten, Anti-Flag, and Left√∂ver Crack have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems. Since the late 1970s, punk rock has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies, including anarchism and socialism. Punk's DIY culture held an attraction for some on the Left, suggesting affinity with the ideals of workers' control, and empowerment of the powerless (though it is arguable that the punk movement's partial focus on apathy towards the establishment, combined with the fact that in many situations, punk rock music generated income for major record companies, and the notable similarities between some strains of anarchism and capitalism, meant that the punk movement ran contrary to left-wing ideologies) ‚Äì and the genre as a whole came, largely through the Sex Pistols, to be associated with anarchism. The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned ‚Äì some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology ‚Äì but bands such as Crass and Dead Kennedys later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK anarcho-punk and US hardcore subgenres, respectively. The Sex Pistols song \\"God Save the Queen\\" was banned from broadcast by the BBC in 1977 due to its presumed anti- Royalism, partly due to its apparent equation of the monarchy with a \\"fascist regime\\". The following year, the release of debut Crass album The Feeding Of the 5000 was initially obstructed when pressing plant workers refused to produce it due to sacrilegious lyrical content. Crass later faced court charges of obscenity related to their Penis Envy album, as the Dead Kennedys later did over their Frankenchrist album artwork. The Clash are regarded as pioneers of political punk, and were seen to represent a progressive, socialistic worldview compared to the apparently anti-social or nihilistic attack of many early punk bands. Partly inspired by 1960s protest music such as the MC5, their stance influenced other first and second wave punk/new wave bands such as The Jam, The Ruts, Stiff Little Fingers, Angelic Upstarts, TRB and Newtown Neurotics, and inspired a lyrical focus on subjects such as racial tension, unemployment, class resentment, urban alienation and police violence, as well as imperialism. Partially credited with aligning punk and reggae, The Clash's anti-racism helped to cement punk's anti-fascist politics, and they famously headlined the first joint Rock Against Racism (RAR)/Anti Nazi League (ANL) carnival in Hackney, London, in April 1978. The RAR/ANL campaign is credited with helping to destroy the UK National Front as a credible political force, aided by the support received from punk and reggae bands. Many punk musicians, such as Vic Bondi (Articles of Faith), Joey Keithley (DOA), Tim McIlrath (Rise Against), The Crucifucks, Bad Religion, The Proletariat, Against All Authority, Dropkick Murphys and Crashdog have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, as well as T.S.O.L. frontman Jack Grisham, have run as candidates for public office under left- wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more populist and conservative opinions, and an ambiguous form of patriotism, beginning in the U.S with many of the groups associated with 1980s New York hardcore, and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the Oi! movement. An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) Skrewdriver and Skullhead, have held far-right and anti-communist stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture. =Rock the Vote= Rock the Vote is an American 501(c)(3) non-profit, non-partisan organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities. Rock the Vote's stated mission is to \\"build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country.\\" Hip hop Hip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when \\"The Message\\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious ‚Äúsocial statement‚Äù. However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort‚Äôs 1980 single ‚ÄúHow We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?‚Äù which called the USA a ‚Äúpolice state‚Äù and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing. Later in the decade hip hop band Public Enemy became \\"perhaps the most well-known and influential political rap group\\" and released a series of records whose message and success \\"directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next decade,\\" helping to inspire a wave of politicised hip hop by artists such as X Clan, Poor Righteous Teachers, Brand Nubian, 2 Black 2 Strong and Paris. The group N.W.A had a political take within their songs. Their most controversial song, \\"Fuck tha Police\\", shone a light on police brutality and the use of racially biased tactics in Los Angeles during the '80s and '90s. Verses such as \\"Fuck the police, coming straight from the underground, a young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown, and not the other color so the police think they have the authority to kill a minority,\\" led them to receive arrest threats for performing police-bashing songs. Their song Express Yourself addressed the restrictive limits on rappers in the industry; the video to the song expresses the view that black people have no voice and are punished when they speak up. Eminem's tenth album, Kamikaze, contained many political messages, most of them revolving around his disapproval of Donald Trump being elected President of the United States. He stated he was willing to lose fans over this criticism and rapped: \\"And any fan of mine/who‚Äôs a supporter of his/I‚Äôm drawing in the sand a line/you‚Äôre either for or against,\\"[7] Victor, Daniel (August 31, 2018). \\"Eminem Addresses Trump Rap in Surprise Album 'Kamikaze'\\". New York Times. During Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Kanye West took the opportunity to support the Republican candidate by urging his fans to vote for Trump. Although West has historically been against the Republican administrations, he has been one of Donald Trumps most vocal supporters. On April 27, 2018, Kanye West and fellow rapper, T.I., released a collaboration called \\"Ye vs. the People\\" that consisted of West and T.I.'s opposing political views. The song, a conversation between the two rappers, became popular not for its musical touch, but because of the courage West and T.I. showed by releasing a controversial song in a time of high political disagreement. Reggae Jamaican Reggae of the 1970s and the 1980s is an example of influential and powerful interaction between music and politics. A top figure-head in this music was Bob Marley. Though Marley was not in favor of politics, through his politicized lyrics he was seen as a political figure. In 1978 Bob Marley‚Äôs One Love Peace Concert brought Prime Minister Michael Manley and the opposition leader Edward Seaga together (leaders connected to notorious rival gang leaders, Bucky Marshall and Claude Massop, respectively), to join hands with Marley during the performance; this was the \\"longest and most political reggae concert ever staged, and one of the most remarkable musical events recorded.\\" Throughout this period many reggae musicians played for and spoke or sung in support of Manley's People's National Party, a campaign credited with helping the PNP's victory in the 1972 and 1976 elections.http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/MANLEY---the- MUSIC_10883342 Popular music Popular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga's song \\"Born This Way\\" has often been known as the international gay anthem, as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina received a great political response from the Hip hop music community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath. This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country. Pop music is common for its sensationalized and mass- produced uplifting beats. Many artists take advantage of their large followings to spread awareness of political issues in their music. Similar to Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way,\\" Macklemore's song \\"Same Love\\" also expresses support and homage to the LGBTQ+ community. Furthermore, Beyonc√©'s album \\"Lemonade\\" has been hailed as awe-inspiring and eye-opening with many of the songs addressing political issues such as racism, stereotyping, police brutality, and infidelity. These songs, aside from being catchy and uplifting, discuss serious issues in a lighthearted and simplified manner allowing people to understand while also commonly being influenced by the current political climate such as the violent attacks on the Bataclan Theater in Paris and the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando. Country music American country music contains numerous images of \\"traditional\\" life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as Merle Haggard's \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\", and \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an \\"us versus them\\" mentality directed at the counterculture \\"hippies\\" and the anti-war crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.Malone, Bill, \\"Country Music U.S.A,\\" 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p.371. More recent American country music songs containing political messages include Keith Urban's song \\"Female\\" which details the psychological and emotional impact that sexist sayings, slut-shaming, and lack of representation female's hold in politics have on women. Another recent American country song that concerns politics is Carrie Underwood's song \\"Love Wins.\\" In this song, Underwood identifies themes of prejudice, hatred, and politics. Through this song, Underwood expresses the idea that the best way to close this divide and strengthen what she sees to be a broken world is through unity, loving each other, and working together in times of crisis. The female country artist Kacey Musgraves integrates politics within the lyrics of her country music, speaking about gay rights and cannabis consumption. Her song \\"Follow Your Arrow\\" is considered to have a radical point of view towards same-sex marriage which differs from the conservative point of view that is normally found in country music. African American country rapper Cowboy Troy, the stage name of Troy Lee Coleman III, incorporates real-life problems into his music, calling for societal change. He sheds light on concepts like class analysis, gender issues, and popular narratives about the \\"white\\" working class. One of his songs called \\"I Play Chicken With The Train\\" acknowledges conservative and progressive electoral points that tend to be brought up with Presidential elections. He said himself that he made a reference to the McCain and Obama race in 2008. Although race is a rare topic to get portrayed by country music, some country artists have made an effort to approach this theme with their songs. On April 19, 2013, Brad Paisley released the album Wheelhouse, including the track \\"Accidental Racist\\", which became controversial. \\"Without a doubt, 'Accidental Racist' generated many negative reviews and most of the commotion after the release of Wheelhouse\\" (Kosar 4) The lyrics to \\"Accidental Racist\\" were not the best but the message it portrayed was very powerful and true. Will Hermes, a well-known American critique from Rolling Stone, commented on the song, \\"It's probably not going to win any awards for songcraft and rapping, but in the wake of movies like Django Unchained and Lincoln, it shows how fraught racial dialogue remains in America\\".Will Hermes, \\"Brad Paisley Ventures Out of Country's 'Wheelhouse'\\", heard on All Things Considered (April 9, 2013), NPR website (accessed March 30, 2019). Brad Paisley stated, \\"This song was meant to generate discussion among the people who listen to my albums.\\" Classical music Beethoven's third symphony was originally called \\"Bonaparte\\". In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed \\"Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man\\". Verdi's chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera Nabucco is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)‚Äîthe \\"Risorgimento\\". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament. Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused John Adams of \\"romanticizing terrorists\\" in his opera The Death of Klinghoffer (1991).article in the December 9, 2001, New York Times Arts and Leisure section =In the Soviet Union= RAPM (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. Shostakovich had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvardi. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in The Worker and the Theatre, Shostakovich's Tahiti Trot (used with the ballet The Golden Age) was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of \\"ideology harmful to the proletariat\\"\\". Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, The First of May (1929) to express \\"the festive mood of peaceful construction\\".Shostakovich and Stalin by Solomon Volkov (2004)Shostakovich Studies (1995) edited by David Fanning Prokofiev wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (1937). Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar. Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film Alexander Nevsky concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR. In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical. =Music in Nazi Germany= Stravinsky stated in 1930, \\"I don't believe anyone venerates Mussolini more than I\\"; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, Carl Orff's cantata Carmina Burana was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem.The Oxford History of Western Music, vol 4 (2005) by Richard Taruskin In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of Goebbels, who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933‚Äì45 the music of Gustav Mahler, a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic. Richard Strauss's opera Die Schweigsame Frau (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, Stefan Zweig, was a Jew. White Power music Racist music or white power music is music associated with and promoting neo-Nazism and white supremacy ideologies.Intelligence Report: a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Issues 133‚Äì136; Southern Poverty Law Center, Klanwatch Project, Southern Poverty Law Center. Militia Task Force, Publisher Klanwatch, 2009. Although musicologists point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by National Socialist black metal.Dominic J. Pulera, Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America, pages 309‚Äì311. 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands. Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'. Contemporary white-supremacist groups include \\"subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music.\\"Barbara Perry, Hate Crimes, Greenwood Publishing Group, , , 2009, pages 51‚Äì2. According to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission \\"racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits.\\"\\"Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment\\", Cyber racism, Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.Anne Rooney, Race Hate, Evans Brothers, 2006, , , page 29.

The ketone group is the double- bonded oxygen. A ketose is a monosaccharide containing one ketone group per molecule. The simplest ketose is dihydroxyacetone, which has only three carbon atoms, and it is the only one with no optical activity. All monosaccharide ketoses are reducing sugars, because they can tautomerize into aldoses via an aldol intermediate, and the resulting aldehyde group can be oxidised, for example in the Tollens' test or Benedict's test. Ketoses that are bound into glycosides, for example in the case of the fructose moiety of sucrose, are nonreducing sugars.

The test relies on the dehydration reaction which occurs more quickly in ketoses, so that while aldoses react slowly, producing a light pink color, ketoses react more quickly and strongly to produce a dark red color. Ketoses can isomerize to aldoses through the Lobry-de Bruyn-van Ekenstein transformation.

TV Guide included him in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.Bretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). \\"Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time\\". TV Guide. pp. 14 - 15. Biography Arvin Sloane is the cold, calculating leader of SD-6, directing its operations against the U.S. government under the guise of being a secret organization within the government itself. He is eventually promoted to being a full member of \\"The Alliance\\", the organization that operates above each individual SD cell. It is revealed through the course of the series that Sloane speaks Spanish, French, Japanese, Nepali, Mandarin, and Russian and reads Homeric Greek. It was revealed in the third season that Sloane has a life-threatening allergy to morphine. Sloane is married to his long-time wife, Emily, for over 30 years. Early in his marriage Sloane was with the CIA, attached to the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is where he first encountered the works of Milo Rambaldi. Initially, Sloane dismissed Rambaldi and his works. That would change following the death of Arvin and Emily's infant daughter, Jacqueline. Wracked with grief, Sloane stumbled across some Rambaldi pages that he had stuck in a desk drawer and forgotten about. Reviewing the pages, Sloane was gripped by the possibilities inherent in what he saw there. This interest would rapidly grow into an obsession with all things Rambaldi. At some point, Sloane had a brief affair with Jack Bristow's wife, Irina Derevko (alias Laura). This resulted in the birth of the child who would become known as Nadia Santos. It is unclear exactly when this affair took place or exactly when Nadia was born. Sydney Bristow was born in 1975. It's stated in the series that Michael Vaughn's father kidnapped Nadia for her own safety when she was a young girl, and he was killed by Irina in 1979. It's also stated that Irina gave birth to Nadia in a Russian prison after she left Jack. Sydney is age 6 when Irina fakes her death in late 1981, which means that Nadia must have been born in 1982. The timelines cannot be reconciled. Regardless of the exact timeline, Jack did not learn of this affair for over two decades. After Irina's apparent death, Jack was taken into federal custody and Sloane and Emily became Sydney's temporary guardians. Sydney believes that she didn't meet Sloane until she was recruited, as she reveals in season 2 episode Cipher that she has \\"big gaps in [her] memory\\" around the time of the death of her mother. Some time after that, Sloane and a number of other CIA agents broke from the agency to attach themselves to the Alliance of Twelve. Sloane eventually became head of that section of the Alliance known as SD-6. When Sydney was 19 and a freshman in college, Sloane recruited her to join SD-6, convincing her that she was joining the CIA. Storyline =Season 1= Partway through season 1, it is revealed that Emily was suffering from apparent terminal cancer. Emily learned that her husband had never truly left the world of intelligence. She made the mistake of telling Sydney what she knew and SD-6 soon caught wind of this fact. As a condition of Sloane's being promoted to a full member of the Alliance he was ordered to kill his wife. Unable to bring himself to do this, Sloane set up an elaborate ruse, including the amputation of Emily's finger, to convince the Alliance that she was dead. =Season 2= Concurrent with his engineering the downfall of The Alliance and SD-6, Sloane went underground, allying with Julian Sark and continuing his obsessive pursuit of Rambaldi artifacts. Emily collaborated secretly with the CIA to expose her husband's new crimes and consented to helping them capture Sloane by wearing a hidden wire but was coaxed by Sloane, during this operation, swaying Emily from her cooperation with the CIA, thus allowing them to foil the CIA's original task. They attempted to flee together, with cover fire from Julian Sark and the help of Sydney's mother, Irina Derevko, (who was stealing a Rambaldi book) to Sloan's awaiting helicopter, but Emily was accidentally shot in the shoulder by the bullet meant for her husband and killed by Marcus Dixon, a former SD-6 agent now with the CIA. In retaliation, Sloane later arranged for Dixon's death by having a bomb placed in his vehicle one night while he and his wife, Diane, were having dinner with Sydney & Vaughn. Dixon & Diane were supposed to be in the same vehicle but ended up driving separate vehicles that night. His wife, who had already gotten into her SUV and was driving away, was killed in the car bomb explosion. At the last minute, Dixon had turned around and was coming back to tell Sydney something, sparing him from seeing the actual explosion. =Season 3= Between seasons 2 and 3 (the two-year gap where Sydney went missing), Sloane turned himself in to the U.S. government and, in exchange for a full pardon, utilized all of his knowledge to help bring down various terrorist organizations. Sloane then moved to Zurich, Switzerland, setting up a humanitarian organization called Omnifam and apparently becoming a philanthropist, claiming that his research into Rambaldi's secrets led him to one word: peace. Sloane still occasionally worked for the CIA by utilizing his contacts with the Covenant and other organizations, but his motives still elicited suspicion within the government, and particularly from Sydney, who never forgave him for authorizing the murder of her fianc√© during the SD-6 days. In fact, besides the word \\"peace\\", the Rambaldi device known as Il Dire (The Telling) printed out the DNA pattern for a person Rambaldi called The Passenger. Sloane determined that The Passenger was his daughter with Irina Derevko, a woman named Nadia Santos who was an agent with Argentine intelligence. Sloane abducts her and injects her with a green \\"Rambaldi fluid\\" which makes her a \\"living conduit to Rambaldi\\". Nadia generates a complex algebraic equation that translates into a longitude and latitude for another Rambaldi artifact, The Sphere of Life. Sloane and Nadia briefly teamed up to recover the Sphere, but Nadia left her father when it appeared his Rambaldi obsession had become madness; she returned to Argentina. =Season 4= Sloane is subsequently pardoned again and is recruited by the CIA to head up a new black ops division patterned after SD-6, called Authorized Personnel Only (APO). Sloane's first task was to hand-pick the agents he wanted to serve in the APO, choosing Sydney, Jack, Dixon and Vaughn. He later successfully convinced Nadia to join and added Marshall Flinkman and Eric Weiss. Sloane's biggest challenge as the head of APO was in convincing Sydney, Vaughn, and Marcus that his intentions are genuine. Under orders by CIA superiors to keep close tabs on Sloane, the three agents have on several occasions sparked false alarms as to Sloane's loyalty. Meanwhile, Sloane and Jack have been following an agenda of their own, that appears to be related to the surviving sisters of Irina Derevko. Late in season four it was revealed there was another man, dubbed \\"Arvin Clone\\" and virtually identical to Arvin Sloane in every way, was still tracking down Rambaldi artifacts in Sloane's name and committing numerous criminal acts in the process. \\"Arvin Clone\\" (real name Ned Bolger) is blamed for Irina's death by setting her up to appear as if she had contracted an assassin to kill Sydney. Toward the conclusion of the fourth season, Sloane confesses that through his work with Omnifam, he has seeded water supplies around the world with chemical contaminants designed to make humanity more peaceful. He abandons his post as APO director, apparently to join Elena Derevko's scheme to destroy civilization using the contaminated water in conjunction with the Mueller device. In reality, Sloane is infiltrating Elena's organization in order to stop her endgame but Dixon is seriously wounded when trying to stop Sloane. During the final mission to stop Elena, Sloane aids APO, but in doing so is forced to shoot Nadia (who has been transformed by the chemical contaminants into a killing machine and is strangling Sydney). As the season ends, Sloane is imprisoned by the CIA, but receives an unexpected visit from Sydney, who tells him she believes his motives were good as she arranges for him to visit with his daughter. =Season 5= During the fifth season, Sloane finds himself at the mercy of turncoat CIA agent Gordon Dean, who runs an SD-6-like criminal organization called \\"The Shed\\" on behalf of a larger group called Prophet Five. Dean arranges for Sloane to be released from federal custody, opening the door for Sloane to be reinstated with APO (albeit at a lower rank), which will allow Sloane to search for a cure for Nadia's condition. Dean threatens to undo all this if Sloane doesn't agree to act as a mole within APO. This arrangement is short-lived as Sloane ultimately refuses to jeopardize the safety of Sydney or the others any longer, and he betrays Dean. Dean is captured by APO, but Sloane soon finds himself becoming beholden to another (as yet unexplained) element of Prophet Five, who holds the key to curing Nadia. This is proven when Nadia briefly regains consciousness. Under the promise of a more permanent cure, Sloane is ordered to kill Dean, which he does. Once again, Sloane is forced to act as a mole within APO on behalf of Prophet Five, with a vague promise of a cure for Nadia. When he attempts to use his new contact to locate Sydney after she is kidnapped, he is asked to make a choice between saving Sydney and saving Nadia. Ultimately, Sloane continues to work with Prophet Five until they provide him with a cure for Nadia's condition. He administers it, and she is successfully cured. Sloane's relationship with Nadia was always hindered by his obsession with Rambaldi's work (frequently at the expense of her well-being). This tension between his love for Nadia and his fixation upon Rambaldi comes to a head when Nadia demands that he choose between her and Page 47. The severity of his dichotomy was evident as he tearfully begs Nadia, \\"Please, don't make me choose between the two most important things in my life.\\" When Nadia casts Page 47 into the fireplace, Sloane's obsession takes hold and he throws her out of the way to save it, accidentally killing her when she falls through a glass table. Following Nadia's death, Sloane realizes that his faith in Rambaldi was all he ever truly had, making the betrayal of his loved ones inevitable. Nadia's death, according to this interpretation, was a necessary sacrifice. Sloane then leaves APO to join Prophet Five and see Rambaldi's work to its conclusion. Sloane subsequently is haunted by an apparition of Nadia, who states she is only appearing because Sloane wants her to be there. Sloane realized that once his expertise with Rambaldi was no longer necessary to Prophet Five, he would be 'removed' from their services permanently. To this end he convinced Julian Sark and Kelly Peyton to betray Prophet Five and ally with him, having Peyton execute all leaders of Prophet Five and having Sark eliminate APO with high explosives (killing Thomas Grace). Sloane finally set about achieving his endgame, kidnapping Marshall Flinkman and Rachel Gibson to force them to hack into a satellite network to locate a cavern where he could utilize another Rambaldi artifact, an amulet, to uncover further details towards the fruition of his ultimate goal. Finally, Sloane's endgame was achieved in Mongolia, in the Tomb of Rambaldi, where Sloane used The Horizon to create a strange hovering sphere from which a reddish liquid drained. However before the purpose of this sphere could be revealed, Sydney intervened, removing The Horizon from its setting and causing the sphere to dissipate. A stand-off ensued and Sloane shot Jack to distract Sydney long enough for Sark to recover The Horizon from her. However, Sloane himself was shot and killed in retaliation by Sydney, one bullet entering his head to confirm a kill. As Sloane's body collapsed, he fell into a vat of the strange liquid created by The Horizon which imbued with him special gifts, apparently the ultimate revelation of Rambaldi, immortality. Sloane recovered from his bullet wounds and was revived fully intact but was confronted by a dying Jack Bristow. Sloane offered his old friend the chance to be saved in the same rejuvenating liquid but Jack refused. Instead, Jack trapped Sloane in the tomb forever by detonating a powerful explosive and sacrificing himself. Sloane is currently trapped under large rocks in the tomb, several hundred feet underground and alone but he is alive and seemingly immortal. The Nadia apparition makes one final appearance before vanishing. It is implied that his fate is to spend eternity trapped in this place. Jacquelyn Sloane Thirty years before season 4, Emily Sloane was pregnant with her and Arvin's daughter. They had considered other names, but eventually stuck with Jacquelyn. It is suggested that the baby died during birth. According to Arvin, it was a risky pregnancy and the baby had fought hard to stay with them, but in the end it was overwhelming and her heart was not strong enough.

Marketing parlance often uses the term \\"tract mansions\\" or executive homes. Description The term \\"McMansion\\" is generally used to denote a new, or recent, multi-story house of no clear architectural style,Stephen A. Mouzon, Susan M. Henderson. Traditional Construction Patterns. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2004. \\"(1) Victorian door and side lights on vaguely classical McMansion, (2) Victorian door and side lights on vaguely Georgian McMansion, (3) possibly an Oriental moon gate door on a vaguely classical house...\\" Pages 144 and 190. which prizes superficial appearance and sheer size over quality. McMansion may either refer to oversized and cheaply built houses developed at once in a subdivision, or refer to a dwelling that replaces a smaller house, in a neighborhood of smaller houses, which seems far too large for its lot (such a McMansion may lack side windows due to the proximity to the boundaries‚Äîanother McMansion- related clich√©.). One real-estate writer explains the successful formula for McMansions: symmetrical structures on clear-cut lots with Palladian windows centered over the main entry, and brick or stone enhancing the driveway entrance, plus multiple chimneys, dormers, pilasters, and columns‚Äîand inside, the master suite with dressing rooms and bath-spa, great rooms, breakfast and dining rooms, showplace kitchen, and extra high and wide garages for multiple cars and SUVs. Typical attributes also include a floor area of over ,Not including the basement. Used as a working definition by the Environmental Design Research Association in a 2006 report. This represents a floorspace \\"30 percent larger than the average new house and larger than 80 percent of houses\\" according to the 2000 Census. EDRA37: beyond conflict : proceedings of the 37th Annual Conference of the Environmental Design Research Association, May 3‚Äì7, 2006, Atlanta, Georgia. Page 254. ceilings 9 to 10 feet (3 m) high, a two-story portico, a two-story front door hall usually with a large chandelier, a three or more car garage, usually five or more bedrooms and many bathrooms, extensive crown-moulding style features, and lavish‚Äîif superficial‚Äîinterior features. As noted above, a McMansion replacing a house in a community of smaller-sized houses will cover a much larger portion of the lot than the construction it replaces; in the other usage, McMansions are built en masse in homogeneous communities by a single developer. Origins Beginning in California in the 1980s, the larger home concept was intended to fill a gap between the more modest suburban tract housing and the upscale custom houses found in gated, waterfront, or golf course communities. Such communities were developed as subdivisions, or pre-existing neighborhoods were transformed by building on empty lots or replacing torn-down structures. The larger houses proved popular and demand increased dramatically, particularly in light of new land-management laws that were enacted in the 1980s and '90s. Efforts to economize may have led to a decline in quality for many of these new houses, prompting the coinage of the disparaging term. Because these houses emphasize instant gratification, they are rarely designed with energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, maintainability, and longevity in mind. In a development that runs counter to the previous boom in construction of McMansions, a 2009 report suggested that the Great Recession (2008‚Äì2012) has caused new house sizes in the United States to stabilize. However, as the economy recovered, home sizes returned to their upward trend. Throughout the 2010s, as the McMansion style started to fall out of favor, a style of single- family homes dubbed McModerns began to permeate urban neighborhoods of North America. Unlike the ornamentation and traditional architectural style of McMansions, McModerns emulate modernist architectural styles and are popular with Millennial homebuyers. Attributes =Location= A traditional upscale custom house is found in one of the city's most affluent residential neighbourhoods (commonly regarded as \\"Millionaires' Mile\\"), which are typically gated, waterfront or ravine, or golf course communities, all of which have some of the highest residential property taxes in the city. Most of these communities are usually well-established, and the real estate prices tend to be high but stable.Miles Jaffe. The Hamptons Dictionary: The Essential Guide to Class Warfare. Constellation, 2008. Page 82. The houses themselves feature architectural preferences in general accordance with the neighborhood.Fiona Allon. Renovation nation: our obsession with home. UNSW Press, 2008. Page 151. By contrast, the McMansion larger house is typically constructed on the outskirts of the city, often further out from the city center than suburban tract housing. McMansions are often found on land that is zoned as (or recently re-zoned from) agricultural instead of residential, and often outside of the city proper limits, as both of these result in lower property taxes. These areas may be in demand by buyers who desire a bigger house than the tract house, but do not have the means to afford houses in the city's traditional upscale neighborhoods. Due to this demographic, which is more susceptible to boom and bust economic cycles, prices are volatile and often fueled by speculation.Cecelia Techi. Expos√©s and excess: muckraking in America, 1900‚Äì2000. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004. Pages 33‚Äì34. Another reason why McMansions are generally found in outlying suburban areas is that lot sizes in older neighborhoods usually are not conducive to residences of this large scale. McMansions are usually constructed among other large houses by a subdivider on speculation; they generally are built en-masse by a development company to be marketed as premium real estate, but do not offer custom features. The construction of what seems to be too large a house on an existing lot will often draw the ire of neighbors and other local residents. In 2006, for example, a recently built house in Kirkland, Washington ‚Äì an affluent suburb on Seattle's Eastside ‚Äì stood so close to an adjoining property that, in the words of the chair of the city's Neighborhood Association, \\"you can read the lettering on the canned vegetables in the house next door.\\" =Design= Another typical design flaw: in this example, the decision to create another 45-degree wall just for the main entrance led to an awkward layout even of the roof McMansions often mix a variety of architectural styles and elements, combining quoins, steeply sloped roofs, multiple roof lines, complicated massing and pronounced dormers, all producing what some consider an unpleasant jumbled appearance. The builder may have attempted to achieve expensive effects with cheap materials, skimped on details, or hidden defects with cladding: :Though construction quality may be subpar and materials shoddy (from faux stucco to styrofoam crown molding and travertine compounded from epoxied marble dust), McMansion buyers are eager; the real-estate writer locates them in the generation of my angst-ridden Boston University students: \\"mostly young, mobile, career-oriented, high- salaried 30- and 40-something individuals\\" who are too time-squeezed to hire an architect but seek \\"a luxury home\\" that they might soon (and easily) sell whenever \\"it's time to move on.\\" Frequently, priority in McMansions construction is given to the interior layout. It has been claimed that this causes the exterior appearance to suffer from an \\"amorphous\\" or \\"bloated\\" quality. From Metropolitan Home, Volume 24 (1992): \\"This is no McMansion. Every door is perfectly placed, every proportion is exactly right.\\" Some neighborhoods may also be referred to as \\"Cookie Cutter\\" neighborhoods ‚Äì in some developments, all the houses have the same layout and design with minor differences, such as siding color or shutter color. House with large garage and short driveway depth taking up a large amount of street frontage. Also evident: several cheaply installed neoclassical elements, a brick facade, no side windows, and poorly proportioned windows on the front. Economics From the perspective of a housebuilder, luxury houses of or more are more profitable than smaller houses. Many communities have few residential lots available; thus, those builders who acquire them are likely to build a luxury house. As of 2014 32% of the new houses being built were or more, and the average size of new construction had increased to over . Worldwide McMansions have seen rising popularity in China, and there have been replicas of famous buildings such as the White House and the Palace of Versailles. Criticism The widespread disdain for the McMansion stems from perceptions that these houses look and feel inappropriate for a given neighborhood, waste land (suburban sprawl, too much room for too few people) and resources (building materials, utilities, long commutes), project the pretentiousness (or lack of taste or refinement) of their owners, and a general discordance in architectural preferences. McMansions have received extensive criticism in Australia because they do not blend in with the archetypal Australian house (generally single story red brick or bungalows) and because they use render materials perceived as giving an ugly, over the top, and exaggerated appearance. Australians often buy older, modest houses as tear downs and build McMansions on the vacant land, leading to one observer noting that in the country \\"a poor house stands side by side with a good house.\\"Davison, Graeme. \\"The Past & Future of the Australian Suburb.\\" Australian Planner (Dec. 1994): 63‚Äì69.

The series ran on the ABC until 1988, when it was axed and subsequently revived as a segment on Seven Network's Fast Forward in April 1989. It featured puppets of major political and social characters.  Production  The Rubbery Figures programs were made in the Melbourne film studio of Peter Nicholson, who also made the puppets themselves. Almost all the character voices for the puppets were performed by Melbourne voice actor Paul Jennings.  Fast Forward's Rubbery Figures  Steve Vizard, the man behind Channel seven's Fast Forward had seen Rubbery Figures on the ABC and thought they would make a good point of difference from competing comedy sketch series. Due to budget constraints, Peter Nicholson semi autonomously produced five minute segments that could be inserted into the programme. During this period the figures expanded into less current political satire; for example the puppets of Prime Minister Bob Hawke and then Treasurer Paul Keating played the parts of Captain Kirk and Mr Spock onboard the enterprise. = Characters =  Australian politicians  The primary characters of Rubbery Figures were politicians native to Australia. The Rubbery Figures political characters included: *Bob Hawke - portrayed as a self-centred, power-hungry opportunist *Paul Keating - depicted as Hawke's down-to-earth but ambitious crony *Andrew Peacock - John Howard's main competition for the Liberal Party leadership, portrayed as vain and snobbish *John Howard - depicted as an irritating, nerdy loser *John Elliott - with his catchphrase of ‚Äúpig's arse‚Äù  International politicians  Rubbery Figures also satirised prominent world politicians of the time, among them were: *Margaret Thatcher - the then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who was depicted as an eccentric profiteer, eager to appeal to the Australian government *Ronald Reagan - the then-President of the United States, who was portrayed as a lumberjack, making decisions based on the horoscope or guesswork, and intent on keeping his nuclear weapons program a secret *Mikhail Gorbachev - former Premier of the Soviet Union, who was depicted as an easygoing liberal who was always giving himself time off *Muammar al-Gaddafi - the ruler of Libya, whose puppet was permanently impaled by a missile with the letters \\"USA\\" painted on one side Comparison with Spitting Image The Sunday Mail noted in 1988 that \\"People think creator Peter Nicholson borrowed the idea for Rubbery Figures from the British puppet show Spitting Image. But Nicholson quickly points out he created his puppets before Spitting Image was shown in Australia\\". Nicholson told the Herald: \\"The programs are from slightly different traditions...Ours springs more from the newspaper political cartoon than the comedy tradition of Spitting Image. They are probably more gratuitous. Their people are a bit unkind. They set out to deliberately make people look terrible, whereas I think our people should look a bit redeemable\\".  Music  In 1991, a music track called \\"The Recession Rap\\" with the rubbery figures was released.The music and lyrics were written by David Atkin, Peter Benson and Troy Hazard, the music was produced by David Atkin and Peter Benson and the characters were sung by Paul Jennings. It reached #60 on the ARIA Chart in August, and was nominated for an Aria award in 1992.  On Exhibition  Although no longer being viewed on television, the Figures appeared at several exhibitions in the 90's. In 1993 they were recast and refurbished to take part in \\"The Exhibition We Had To Have\\" at the National Gallery of Victoria as part of the Melbourne Comedy Festival. In 1994 \\"The Rubbery Years\\" in conjunction with the National Museum ran for six months at Old Parliament House in Canberra.

(formerly known as Limited Brands, Inc. and The Limited, Inc.) is an American fashion retailer based in Columbus, Ohio. Its flagship brands include Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. L Brands posted $12.914 billion in revenue in 2019, and was listed as 248 on the 2020 Fortune 500 list of largest United States companies by revenue. In February 2020, L Brands announced the planned sale of its Victoria Secret division to Sycamore Partners, private equity firm. Under the agreement, Sycamore Partners would gain a 55% controlling stake in Victoria's Secret while L Brands would keep a 45% stake, leaving Bath & Body Works to become L Brand's sole business. The sale fell through in May 2020, although Wexner did step down as CEO as planned, replaced by Andrew Meslow. History = Early history = Bella Cabakoff was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and moved to Columbus as a toddler. At age 21, she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain. After spending over 20 years working for Lazarus, in 1951, she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women's clothing store named Leslie's (after their son) on State Street. This store became the training ground for Leslie \\"Les\\" Wexner. In 1963, he borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio. This store was named \\"The Limited\\" because the store focused on clothing for younger women, unlike his parents' general merchandise store. Later in 1964, Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture. The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend Jim Waldron, who served as Senior Vice President. Bella Wexner served as secretary until her death in 2001, Harry as chairman (he served until his death in 1975), and Leslie, CEO from inception, who later succeeded his father as the chairman. , he and his family continue to own 17% of LB. In 1969, Wexner took The Limited Brands public and sold 47,600 shares at $7.25 a share.

His Metcalfe descent can be traced back to the 14th century in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire, where the Metcalfe family originated. Having been educated at Eton, in 1800 Metcalfe sailed for India as a writer in the service of the Company. He then studied Oriental languages as the first student at Lord Wellesley's College of Fort William. His younger brother, Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalfe, 4th Baronet (1795‚Äì1853) was an agent of the Governor General of India to the Mughal court. Metcalfe had a Sikh wife and three sons.Sita Anantha Raman 2009 Women in India: a social and cultural history, volume 2. Praeger, p. 87. Career Letter given by Sir Charles Metcalfe to Bahadur Shah Zafar Portrait of Akbar II with Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalf [sic] and court dignitaries At the age of nineteen, Metcalfe was appointed political assistant to General Lake, who was then conducting the final campaign of the Second Anglo-Maratha War against Yashwantrao Holkar. In 1808 he was selected by Lord Minto for the responsible post of envoy to the court of Ranjit Singh at Lahore; here, on 25 April 1809, he concluded the important Treaty of Amritsar securing the independence of the Sikh states between the Sutlej and the Jumna. His first tenure as Resident at Delhi began on 25 February 1811 for the East India Company, (from 1813 for British Government), and in 1819 he received from Lord Hastings the appointment of secretary in the secret and political department. From 1820 to 1825 Sir Charles (who succeeded his brother in the baronetcy in 1822) was resident at the court of the Nizam, and afterwards was summoned in an emergency to his former post at Delhi. =Governor of Agra= On 14 November 1834 he was posted as Governor of the Presidency of Agra where he served for over four months till 20 March 1835.The India list and India Office list for 1905 By Great Britain, India Office #130 =Acting Governor-General= In 1827 he obtained a seat in the supreme council, and in March 1835, after he had acted as the first governor of the proposed new presidency of Agra, he provisionally succeeded Lord William Bentinck as the Governor-General of Bengal (1835‚Äì36). During his brief tenure of office (it lasted for only one year) he carried out several important measures, including that for the liberation of the press, which, while almost universally popular, complicated his relations with the directors at home to such an extent that he resigned the service of the Company in 1838. In 1835 he was also appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB). =Lieutenant Governor of the North-Western Provinces= He was Lieutenant- Governor of the North-Western Provinces from 1 June 1836 to 1 June 1838.http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_BrProvinces.htmThe India list and India Office list for 1905 By Great Britain, India Office #130 =Governor of Jamaica= In 1839 he was appointed by the Second Melbourne ministry to the governorship of Jamaica, where the difficulties created by the recent passing of the Negro Emancipation Act had called for a high degree of tact and ability. Metcalfe's success in this delicate position was very marked, but unfortunately his health compelled his resignation and return to England in 1842. =Governor General of the Province of Canada= St. William Grant Park in Kingston, Jamaica Baron Metcalfe, Charles Theophilus, 1846. Six months afterwards he was appointed by the Peel ministry to the post of Governor General of the Province of Canada with instructions to resist further development of responsible government. A clash soon emerged between Metcalfe and the leaders of the legislative assembly, Robert Baldwin and Louis- Hippolyte Lafontaine. Despite suffering from worsening cancer, he fought to preserve the prerogatives of the Crown and the governor's control over the administration and patronage. He nonetheless had to make some concessions to win support, and the most notable of these was persuading the Colonial Office to grant amnesty to the rebels of 1837-38, and to abandon forced anglicization of the French-speaking population. Final years Metcalfe's success in Canada carrying out the policy of the home government was rewarded with a peerage shortly after his return to England, with the title Baron Metcalfe, of Fern Hill in the County of Berkshire in 1845. But his success did not endure and responsible government would be conceded by his successor James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin. Metcalfe died of cancer at Malshanger in Oakley, near Basingstoke, on 5 September 1846. His residence was however at Fernhill Park in Winkfield, near Windsor and it was in the parish church there that he was buried.

In some countries the graduate diploma and postgraduate diploma are synonymous, while in others (particularly where the graduate diploma is at undergraduate degree level) the postgraduate diploma is a higher qualification. Canada Graduate diplomas offered in Canada (French: Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes sup√©rieures sp√©cialis√©es), are typically taken following a bachelor's degree and a successful award allows progression to a master's degree. Depending on the institution, a graduate diploma in Canada may be at graduate level or bachelor's level. Similar courses at other Canadian institutions may be termed postgraduate diplomas at graduate level and post-baccalaureate diploma at bachelor's level. Australia The graduate diploma is normally taken following a bachelor's degree, and some master's degree programs have graduate diploma as a nested (interim) award. The qualification is at level 8 of the Australian Qualifications Framework, the same as an honours degree. This qualification is at the same level as the post graduate diploma qualifications awarded in New Zealand institutions and Australian graduate diplomas should not be confused with New Zealand graduate diplomas as they belong to two different qualification levels. New Zealand In New Zealand, a graduate diploma is an advanced undergraduate qualification normally completed after a bachelor's degree or done at the same time of the bachelors study, and can be used as a bridging qualification to prove a student's ability to undertake postgraduate studies for a completely different field. A graduate diploma (e.g., Graduate Diploma in Education etc.) is different from a postgraduate diploma, which is a course of study at postgraduate level (e.g., Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology etc.). In universities and learning institutes, it is commonly studied by students who have already graduated in a different field and allows them to pursue a new profession. It mainly involves undertaking courses in an accelerated undergraduate level (e.g., normally a mixture of second and third year courses from the bachelor's degree) in order for the student to attain the requirements equivalent to student who studied towards an undergraduate degree. UK In the UK, a graduate diploma is a short course, with a value of 80‚Äì120 UK credits (equivalent to 40‚Äì60 ECTS credits), that is normally studied by students who have already graduated in another field. Graduate diplomas are distinguished from graduate certificates by having a longer period of study, equivalent to two thirds of an academic year or more. Until the 1990s, the British conservatoires of music offered three year undergraduate courses to some of their students, leading the award of the Graduate Diploma, e.g. GRSM, GTCL, equivalent to a university first degree in music. When a number of conservatoires became affiliated to or constituent colleges of universities, the graduate diplomas were gradually replaced by the award of the BMus degree to all successful students. A graduate diploma should not be confused with a postgraduate diploma, which is a master's degree-level qualification in the UK. Historically, this has not always been the case, with postgraduate diploma and graduate diploma used interchangeably, but the Quality Assurance Agency now makes a clear distinction between these titles. Some institutions have renamed courses as a result, e.g. The College of Law renamed the official title for its law conversion course from Postgraduate Diploma in Law to Graduate Diploma in Law as, although the law conversion course is studied postgraduately, the contents of the course are only undergraduate in nature. In 2018, the Royal College of Art launched a new Graduate Diploma in Art and Design programme aimed at preparing graduate students for its master's degree programmes in Art and Design. Ireland The graduate diploma or higher diploma in the Republic of Ireland is an award at the same level as an honours bachelor's degree. It comprises one year of full-time study and is taken after, and in a different subject from, an earlier bachelor's degree. A wide variety of courses are offered; it is also possible to progress to a master's degree. The diploma is generally in two forms: *A reorientation type qualification to reskill a graduate with new specialised skills, for instance the HDipStats - Higher Diploma in Statistics is aimed at offering additional skills in statistics. See also Higher Diploma. *A professional type qualification which is necessary to enter a profession, for instance the HDipEd - Higher Diploma in Education allows a person to register and practice teaching. See also Postgraduate Diploma. The graduate diploma (GradDip) is offered by the Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin City University, HETAC and the University of Limerick. The higher diploma (HDip) is offered by HETAC, NUI institutions, and Trinity College, Dublin. India In India graduate diploma, is a master's degree-level qualification which usually is a 3 years advanced program. Certain institutes provide master's level programs with increased number lower credit courses for 2 years, such courses are also called postgraduate diploma. At times for transnational equivalency the same is casually noted as Graduate diplomas. Advanced diplomas provided are equivalent to a post-baccalaureate diploma, this is an eight-month to one-year course. Singapore  The graduate diploma is an academic or vocational qualification; as an academic qualification it is often taken after a bachelor's degree although sometimes only a foundation degree is required. It is usually awarded by a university or a graduate school and usually takes 2 terms of study to complete. It is also possible for academic graduate diploma holders to progress to a master's degree on an accelerated pathway compared to first embarking on a 3- or 4-year degree program. To ensure that the graduate diploma qualification is recognised, the awarding body must be registered with the Singapore Ministry of Education. The graduate diploma is generally a professional conversion qualification to reskill a graduate with new specialised skills, for instance the GDipPsy - Graduate Diploma in Psychology is aimed at offering specialised skills in psychology. See also postgraduate diploma. The graduate diploma is offered at different levels by different institutions. The National University of Singapore requires study at master's level, but the graduate diplomas at the Singapore University of Social Sciences are UK (i.e. bachelor's-level) graduate diplomas awarded by the University of London and similarly the Ngee Ann - Adelaide Education Centre offers Australian graduate diplomas (i.e. Australian honours degree level) awarded by the University of Adelaide. The Graduate Diploma of Singapore Raffles Music College is a post-foundation degree qualification rather than post-bachelor's. Graduate diplomas from Aventis School of Management are part- time courses that is accredidated by The Association of Psychotherapists and Counsellors Singapore (APACS) or registered with European Foundation for Management Development and the European Council for Business Education (ECBE) The WSQ Graduate Diploma is the highest qualification in Singapore's vocational Workforce Skills Qualifications framework, administered by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency. This is not tied to the levels of academic degrees. Denmark In Denmark there are two forms of master's degree. The master's degree or candidatus is a FQ-EHEA second-cycle qualification worth 120 ECTS credits. These degrees are research-based and offered through universities (e.g. University of Copenhagen and Copenhagen Business School). The second form is the Graduate Diploma within the adult further education system, which is worth 60 ECTS credits and is taught part- time. The graduate diploma is normally taken following a bachelor's degree. Diplomas (in Danish: HD) are studied in business-related fields such as Business Administration and Innovation Management. Programs are normally split into Part 1 (graduate certificate) and Part 2 (graduate diploma), each being 60 ECTS Credits (one year of full-time-equivalent study). United States In the US, graduate diplomas are \\"Intermediate Graduate Qualifications\\" involving study beyond master's level but not reaching PhD level. They are generally found in professional, rather than academic, fields. Other qualifications at this level include advanced graduate certificates, specialist certificates and specialist degrees. Malaysia The graduate diploma forms part of the lifelong education pathway on the Malaysian Qualifications Framework. They are qualifications at the level of a bachelor's degree but with half of the credit value.

Launched on 20 August 1944, she was sponsored by Mrs. Edward J. Kelly, wife of the Mayor of Chicago, Illinois, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 10 January 1945, Captain Richard R. Hartung, USN, in command. World War II Chicago spent her first six weeks preparing for sea duty before departing on 26 February for Norfolk. After conducting training exercises, and calibrated her compasses in Chesapeake Bay, the cruiser got underway on 12 March for the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad. Arriving on 18 March, the cruiser conducted shakedown training and shore bombardment exercises off Culebra, Puerto Rico, before returning to Norfolk on 11 April. Following inspections and battle problem training, the cruiser sailed to Philadelphia for post-shakedown repair availability on 16 April. Chicago in May 1945. In company with the destroyer , the cruiser departed for the Caribbean on 7 May, en route to the Pacific Ocean. Designed to operate offensively with strike and amphibious forces, Chicago spent her transit time conducting various anti-air drills, gunnery exercises, and radar tracking training. After refueling at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 11 May, the ships spent three days conducting gunnery practice before departing for Colon, Canal Zone, on 15 May. With transit complete the next day, the ships arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 May. Following another period of gunnery, day battle, anti-aircraft, and shore bombardment exercises off Kahoolawe Island, the cruiser departed for Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, on 28 June. In company with the battleship , Chicago arrived at the atoll on 5 July and immediately refueled from . Underway that same day, with the destroyer , added for anti-submarine screen, the ships joined Rear Admiral Radford's Task Group 38.4 north of the Mariana Islands on 8 July. Added to the anti-aircraft screen, Chicago guarded the Task Group's carriers as they conducted air strikes against the Tokyo Plains area, Honsh≈´, Japan, on 10 July. After refueling on 12 July, the Task Group returned to the Japanese coast and launched air strikes against airfields, shipping, and railways in the northern Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç areas the next day. On 14 July, in company with the battleships , , , cruiser , and nine destroyers of Rear Admiral Shafroth's bombardment unit, Chicago closed northern Honsh≈´ to bombard the Kamaishi industrial area. At 1212, the cruiser joined the battleships in firing on the iron works and warehouses. Although heavy smoke obscured the target from the cruiser's spotting planes, the combination of pre-plotting the target through photo reconnaissance and radar positioning data allowed Chicagos guns to start fires in numerous buildings, several large warehouses, and among nearby oil tanks. At 1251, the cruiser's secondary battery guns began firing on a Japanese destroyer-escort type vessel. The escort was straddled and hit by 5 in shell fire, began smoking, and retired into the harbor. The Task Force retired at 1426, leaving the port under a pall of black smoke. The following day, Chicago operated as \\"a temporary seaplane carrier\\" when the battleship transferred her SC Seahawk floatplanes to the cruiser. By hanging one plane over the side with the crane the crew was still able to launch a Seahawk from the catapult for spotting services. After replenishment operations on 16 July, the cruiser resumed screening the carriers as they launched air strikes over the Tokyo Plains, northern Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç, and the Kure-Kobe area over the next two weeks. On 29 July, in company with and several American battleships, Chicago participated in a night shore bombardment mission against the port of Hamamatsu. Using radar, and assisted by spotting planes dropping flares and rockets, the ships fired at bridges, factories and the rail yard for about an hour. Rejoining the Task Group five hours later Chicago once again screened the carriers as they launched air strikes against the Tokyo- Nagoya area. Operations with the carriers, including a diversion to the south to avoid a typhoon, continued until 9 August when Rear Admiral Shafroth's bombardment unit returned to Kamaishi. The battleships, joined by Chicago, three more heavy cruisers and a Royal Navy light cruiser detachment, delivered another two-hour bombardment of the town before returning to the carrier task forces. For the next six days, the cruiser screened the carriers as they launched continuous strikes against the Japanese Home Islands, until 15 August and the Japanese armistice. Chicago remained with the carriers until 23 August, when she departed for Japan. Anchoring in Sagami Wan on 27 August, and then moving to Tokyo Bay on 3 September, the cruiser supported the unloading of supplies and equipment for Third Fleet occupation forces. Post-War After transferring 47 men and the Marine Detachment for duty at Yokosuka Naval Base, the cruiser remained in port until 23 October when she got underway for the demilitarization of the Izu Islands. Over the next twelve days, inspection teams helped the Japanese garrison on O Shima and Nii Shima demolish gun emplacements, artillery, ammunition and other military equipment on the islands. Three days later, on 7 November, the cruiser got underway for San Pedro, California. After arrival on 23 November Chicago received an overhaul at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, before returning to the Far East. Underway on 24 January 1946, the cruiser arrived in Shanghai on 18 February for occupation duty. She remained there until 28 March as flagship of the Yangtze Patrol, and then sailed to Sasebo, Japan, where she became flagship of Naval Support Force, Japanese Empire Waters. The cruiser visited several other ports in Japan before clearing for the west coast on 14 January 1947. Moved to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, the heavy cruiser was placed out of commission in reserve on 6 June 1947. Rebuilt as missile cruiser On 1 November 1958, Chicago was reclassified CG-11 and towed to San Francisco Naval Shipyard to begin a five-year conversion (20 months longer than Columbus and 13 months longer than Albany) to a Guided Missile Cruiser. Begun on 1 July 1959, the entire superstructure was removed and replaced with new aluminum compartments, modernized electronic systems, and an improved Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) equipped combat information center. Representative of the new technological focus on guided missiles, Chicago was refitted with Tartar and Talos SAM stowage, loading, launching, and guidance systems. Two triple torpedo tubes, an ASROC launcher, two 5 in/38 cal guns, and two antisubmarine helicopters rounded out the cruisers' modifications. Designed to provide long- range air, surface, and sub-surface defense for task forces, Chicago was recommissioned at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 2 May 1964, and was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Nine, Pacific Fleet. Preliminary acceptance trials were conducted throughout the summer until 2 September, when Chicago officially joined the 1st Fleet as an active unit. Following sonar calibration and deperming in Puget Sound the cruiser arrived at her home port of San Diego, California, to begin weapons systems qualifications. Examination and evaluation of the new missile systems were completed by 2 December, following successful trials at the Pacific Missile Range off southern California. Chicago during her commissioning ceremony in San Francisco in 1964, following her massive, five-year rebuild as a guided missile cruiser On 4 January 1965, the cruiser shifted to Long Beach, California, to begin a series of shock tests off San Clemente Island. Equipment tests, as well as damage control exercises, were completed by mid-January. Chicago then departed the area for San Francisco for alterations, receiving upgraded Tartar missile systems and improved electronics. The warship returned to San Diego on 17 April. For the next two months, Chicago continued shakedown training, engineering, navigation, and seamanship drills as well as missile and electronic exercises. In mid-June, the cruiser began Talos fire control developmental testing with the Naval Electronics Laboratory. This, and later tests, examined guidance improvements and experimented with missile replenishment at sea. During fleet exercise \\"Hot Stove\\" in August‚ÄìSeptember, Chicago practiced anti-air and ASW operations, including firing ASROC and tube-launched torpedoes against submerged \\"enemy\\" submarines. Following an ECM exercise Chicago participated in a competitive missile firing exercise and won a gold Missilery \\"E\\" for her Tartar battery. During the first week of October the warship participated in another anti-air exercise, this time shooting down two high-speed, high-altitude drones with Talos and Tartar missiles. After a cruise to Hawaii from 19 October to 3 November, during which the cruiser practiced tactical data sharing training with the aircraft carrier and destroyer , the ship finished out the year conducting tests and exercises in the San Diego area. Local operations continued in the spring, including more missile evaluation tests through February 1966. Returning to San Diego on 4 March the ship underwent operational readiness, technical proficiency, boiler, electronics, and nuclear warfare acceptance inspections. In April, the warship participated in Exercise \\"Gray Ghost,\\" where the cruiser operated as tactical flagship for the anti-air warfare commander, Rear Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.. 1st Vietnam deployment On 12 May 1966, Chicago got underway for her first Vietnam deployment. After stopping at Pearl Harbor and Yokosuka, where a new radar antenna was installed, the ship arrived at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay on 12 June. Picking up her helicopter detachment the cruiser departed the next day for duty with Task Force 77 on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf. On 15 June, Chicago, call-sign Red Crown, began evaluating the concept of radar surveillance of all U.S. Navy air operations over designated areas of the Gulf and North Vietnam. Known as PIRAZ, for \\"positive identification and radar advisory zone,\\"An Unclassified Summary Of PIRAZ (1968). the initial duties of tracking friendly aircraft was expanded to include Air Force planes, controlling barrier combat air patrols, advising support aircraft, and coordinating strike information with the Air Force reporting center at Da Nang, South Vietnam. On 5 July a Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King search and rescue helicopter operating from Chicago rescued an A-4E Skyhawk pilot from who had ejected off the coast of North Vietnam on 4 July. After a port visit to Hong Kong, where the ship had to avoid a typhoon on 17 July, the cruiser returned to Yankee Station on 29 July. On her second PIRAZ tour, in early August, Chicago assumed the duties of anti-air warfare commander for short periods of time and demonstrated the ability of a CG to track complex air operations. After a practice Talos missile shot off Okinawa on 27 August, and a short visit to Keelung, Taiwan, the ship returned to her station on 7 September. The cruiser, expanding air duties once again, soon became the primary source for MIG warning information, and assumed surveillance responsibility for the North Vietnamese-Chinese border. On her fourth PIRAZ tour, from 25 October to 12 November, the cruiser helped improve these procedures, particularly in the area of joint Air Force-Navy cooperation. En route to Sasebo, via Subic Bay, the cruiser stopped at the Okinawa Missile Range to fire two more practice missiles on 18 November. Arriving in Japan on 19 November, the ship visited Yokosuka before departing for home on 27 November. Sailing in rough seas, the ship completed the non-stop voyage on 7 December. The cruiser remained at San Diego for the remainder of the year. Starting in January 1967, the cruiser settled into the busy routine of training, exercises, and inspections. Underway for such widely divergent responsibilities as providing guest cruises for the Secretary of the Navy, serving as First Fleet flagship, and air warfare exercises with USS Constellation, the cruiser spent the first five months of the year off California. In both April and May, Chicago conducted experimental Talos missile tests against surface targets to demonstrate missile versatility. Following readiness inspections, the cruiser departed 6 June for an Alaskan cruise with Commander First Fleet. Arriving in Juneau, Alaska, on 10 June, the ship paid an official visit to that city before returning to San Diego eleven days later. After another fleet exercise in July, where Chicagos Talos battery scored a direct hit on a drone at a range of 96 miles, the cruiser spent August conducting official visits to Seattle, Washington, Vancouver, and Esquimalt, British Columbia. 2nd Vietnam deployment Assigned to tender availability on 1 September, the ship received boiler and other repairs and inspections from before departing for another WestPac deployment on 11 October 1967. After departing Pearl Harbor on 18 October, the warship assisted in vectoring aircraft to the site of a Navy F-8 Crusader crash site, successfully rescuing the pilot. Arriving on station in the Gulf of Tonkin three weeks later, via Yokosuka, Okinawa, and Subic Bay, the ship relieved the cruiser , beginning PIRAZ duties on 12 November. These responsibilities, improved over the past year, included radar surveillance, coordinating barrier CAP and rescue operations, providing MiG and border warnings, and a wide variety of communication and real-time data sharing services. After a visit to Hong Kong from 16 to 21 December, the cruiser moved to Subic Bay for an import availability period completed on 3 January 1968. Chicago steamed to Singapore, for a short rest period, before returning to the PIRAZ station on 13 January. On 28 January, following the seizure of by North Korea, the cruiser steamed to the Sea of Japan to help coordinate air activities for the carriers of Task Group 70.6 as part of Operation Formation Star. On 7 February, as the crisis eased, Chicago departed to resume PIRAZ duties in the Gulf of Tonkin. Following two more PIRAZ cruises, Chicago departed Subic Bay on 1 May and arrived in San Diego on 15 May, via Guam and Pearl Harbor. After a brief diversion to the Pacific Missile Range, to conduct experimental aircraft tracking and missile firings, the cruiser entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 1 July for a regular repair period followed by machinery and electronics sea trials and inspections for the remainder of 1968. 3rd Vietnam deployment On 31 January 1969, Chicago concluded her missile systems qualifications tests, including a Talos test firing against a missile drone, before departing for her third cruise to the Western Pacific on 13 February. The cruiser underwent ten days of upkeep and type training at Subic Bay before assuming duties as PIRAZ ship on 11 March. Twelve days later, the ship began additional Search and Rescue (SAR) duty in the Gulf. This involved maintaining two helicopters on patrol station to provide rescue coverage for Naval aircraft reconnaissance missions. On 17 April, Chicago was ordered to proceed to the Sea of Japan, off Korea, for duty with Task Force 71. In response to the shooting down of an EC-121 by North Korean fighters on 14 April, that killed all 31 personnel on board, the Task Force patrolled the Sea of Japan during the crisis that followed. The cruiser provided PIRAZ and screening duties for the carriers, and their constant air patrols, until 27 April when the ship departed for upkeep at Sasebo, Japan. Following repairs, Talos and Tartar missile tests at the Okinawa missile range, and picking up a group of midshipmen at Da Nang on 23 May, Chicago conducted another long PIRAZ/SAR tour from 23 May to 1 July. After upkeep at Yokosuka, a visit to Hong Kong, and a typhoon evasion, the cruiser returned to the Gulf of Tonkin on 1 August to continue radar surveillance, electronic countermeasures, and missile screen duties. Departing 25 August, the cruiser returned, via Subic Bay, Guam, and Pearl Harbor, to San Diego on 17 September. After a leave and upkeep period, followed by a tender availability that installed Zuni chaff dispensers, the cruiser finished out the year conducting routine inspections, local training exercises, and operations at the missile test range. Author T. J. Jackson Lears was a communications officer aboard Chicago at this time.Marshall, John Douglas (2000) A Family Odyssey University of Washington Press pp.223-229 Chicago, still serving as United States First Fleet flagship for Vice Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr., began the new year quietly, with team training at the Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare school in San Diego. Several fleet exercises, two missile firing tests, and inspections filled the months until 12 June 1970, when the cruiser underwent a two-week repair and alteration period. All four Talos fire control systems were upgraded to include anti-ship targeting and an experimental video target tracker was installed. Communications security, nuclear safety, and operational readiness inspections, as well as final engineering checks, were completed by the end of August. 4th Vietnam deployment Knox is taken in tow by Chicago after being disabled by a fire en route from Guam to Hawaii. Despite cutbacks that had substantially lowered her crew component, the cruiser sailed for Vietnam on 9 September 1970. Arriving on station on 3 October, Chicago conducted PIRAZ and search coordination duties with evasive maneuvering to avoid super typhoons Joan and Kate between 14 and 26 October. After a 27 October refueling accident injured several men, Chicago left the Gulf of Tonkin on 1 November and Captain Stanley Thomas Counts assumed command before the ship arrived in Yokosuka on 7 November. Chicago departed Yokosuka on 17 November and resumed PIRAZ station from 20 November to 19 December. Chicago spent Christmas 1970 in Hong Kong and celebrated the new year in Subic Bay. Chicago left Subic Bay on 11 January and resumed PIRAZ station until 18 February. Chicago departed Subic Bay en route to San Diego on 24 February escorted by the frigate . Knox rescued a Chicago sailor who jumped overboard on 26 February, he thought it would get him discharged. After refueling in Guam on 27 February, Knox suffering a loss of power due to a JP-5 fire in engineering on 3 March. Chicago took Knox in tow until a fleet tug arrived at the scene from Pearl Harbor on 5 March. Upon arrival in San Diego on 11 March, the cruiser began a post-deployment leave and upkeep period. Supply replenishment, inspections, and a midshipmen's cruise in June and July, were followed by exercises, inspections, and a dependent-guest cruise into October. 5th Vietnam deployment Chicago moored in Seattle during the 1971 midshipman cruise. After a final readiness test and embarking five guests of the Secretary of the Navy, Chicago departed for another deployment on 6 November 1971 under the command of Captain Thomas William McNamara. After a weekend stop at Pearl Harbor, where the passengers were debarked, the ship stopped at Guam and Subic Bay before arriving in the Gulf of Tonkin PIRAZ station on 6 December. Chicago celebrated the new year in Singapore, and briefly crossed the equator on 4 January for a line-crossing ceremony at 105¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ east. Chicago then spent a week in Subic Bay before resuming PIRAZ station on 18 January. Chicago launched four RIM-8H Talos-ARM anti-radar homing missiles against North Vietnamese shore-based radar stations in February and March, but no hits were registered.Sherwood, John Darrell Nixon's Trident: Naval Power in Southeast Asia, 1968-1972 (2009) United States Government Printing Office pp.31&36 Radar surveillance and air coordination continued, except for a few days in Subic Bay in late February, until a visit to Hong Kong in late March. The cruiser set course for San Diego before being recalled to PIRAZ station on 3 April 1972 in response to the North Vietnamese Army's invasion of the south. The scale of U.S. air operations increased dramatically as strike and interdiction missions, designed to restrict the movement of men and supplies, were conducted throughout North Vietnam. The cruiser monitored all aircraft flying over the gulf, directed friendly CAP, and, despite intense electronic jamming, coordinated fighter escorts during the mid-April B-52 Stratofortress raids against the North Vietnamese. By maintaining a complete air picture, Chicago vectored damaged bombers around enemy missile sites, set up tanker rendezvous points for planes low on fuel, and directed helicopters on rescue operations. The cruiser also directed friendly fighters against North Vietnamese aircraft. In April and May, Chicagos air intercept controllers directed Navy and Air Force aircraft on CAP missions that were credited with 14 MiGs shot down. Among these was the second MiG downed by Navy aces Randy Cunningham and William P. Driscoll.Sherwood, John Darrell Nixon's Trident: Naval Power in Southeast Asia, 1968-1972 (2009) United States Government Printing Office p.55 Chicagos forward Talos battery downed a MiG at long-range during the mining of Hai Phong harbor on 9 May. Chicago and the cruiser were given the unusual assignment of protecting A-6 Intruder and A-7 Corsair aircraft mining Hai Phong harbor at low altitude during Operation Pocket Money. To avoid exposing F-4 Phantom fighters to North Vietnamese ground-based anti-aircraft defenses, these ships patrolling offshore were given a free-fire zone for Talos missiles to engage defending MiG fighters approaching the coast from Ph√∫c Y√™n and K√©p airfields near Hanoi. Chicago came under fire from North Vietnamese coastal artillery batteries, but was able to maintain missile envelope coverage while moving out of gun range before suffering any damage. After a month of surveillance and directing air strikes against Hai Phong harbor traffic, Chicago finally departed for San Diego on 21 June 1972. Post-Vietnam Chicago in early 1970s Arriving home on 8 July, the ship underwent a local availability before entering Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 25 August for a Complex Overhaul. During this refit, Chicago received new digital fire control systems, replacing the old analog computers, installed new missile launchers, and expanded her electronics equipment. On 15 May 1973, Chicago began carrying out six months of sea trials, tests, and training evolutions. New equipment and combat coordination procedures were also implemented, extending the cruiser's operational readiness date to 14 December. Finally, after refresher training, fleet exercises, and weapons load-out, the cruiser departed for another WestPac deployment on 21 May 1974. After arrival at Subic Bay on 15 June, the ship prepared for an extended cruise with the frigate , destroyer , and auxiliary vessel . Designed to counter the Soviet Navy's presence in Somalia and Aden on the Indian Ocean, the low-key port visits were intended to demonstrate that \\"the Indian Ocean is not a Russian lake\\". Departing Subic Bay on 25 June, the squadron passed through the Straits of Malacca on 2 July and arrived at Karachi, Pakistan six days later. Underway on 13 July, Chicago and her escorts began a monthlong at- sea period, \\"showing the flag\\" in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden, before arriving at Mombassa, Kenya on 9 August. A week later, in an effort to influence Russian negotiations for basing rights in the Mauritius Islands, the squadron conducted a diplomatic port visit to Port Louis. Toward this end, Chicago embarked several Mauritian government officials on 21 August for a two-day cruise to Rodrigues Island. Departing on 23 August, the ships returned to Subic Bay, via Singapore, for upkeep on 11 September. Following a visit to Hong Kong in early October, the cruiser spent the next month conducting training and fleet exercises in the Philippines area until getting underway for Guam on 17 November. After a week at Apra Harbor, the ship departed on 29 November for San Diego. Arriving home on 14 December, the ship remained in port for leave, repairs, and upkeep into March 1975. Technical inspections and equipment modifications, interspersed with a visit by a delegation of French officials, lasted until April when the ship conducted interim refresher training in the southern California operating areas. Following a series of missile tests in late May, and fleet exercises with Pacific naval units, the cruiser visited Seattle for the Fourth of July celebrations. After a visit to Vancouver the following week, Chicago returned to San Diego to begin overhaul preparations. From 9 September to 24 October, the cruiser underwent a major restricted availability as repairs were conducted to fuel tanks, boiler casings, and the main propulsion plant. Additional upkeep, tender availability, and type training continued through the new year as the cruiser prepared for another deployment. In February 1976, personnel in the Operations department underwent extensive team training in anti-air, anti-submarine, and electronic warfare in preparation for a fleet exercise in March. That operation, exercise \\"Valiant Heritage\\", took place from 2‚Äì11 March with forces from Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States. Following a month in port, and several service inspections, Chicago left San Diego on 13 April to deploy to the Western Pacific. Sailing with an amphibious group the cruiser conducted multi-ship exercises, both before and after Pearl Harbor, and arrived at Yokosuka on 3 May. Task group exercises with the aircraft carrier , \\"Multiplex 2-76\\" from 19‚Äì25 May and \\"Multiplex 3-76\\" in the South China Sea from 4‚Äì7 June, and port visits to Subic Bay and Keelung, occupied Chicago through June. After a midshipmen cruise from Yokosuka to the Philippines in early July, the cruiser began an import period lasting until 2 August. On 4 August, the cruiser participated in \\"Multiplex 1-7T\\", followed by a successful missile firing exercise off Poro Point, Luzon on 7 August. Returning to Subic Bay for two weeks of upkeep, the cruiser sailed for Hong Kong on 22 August. Arriving three days later, after avoiding a third typhoon, the ship spent six days in that liberty port. Leaving Hong Kong on 31 August, Chicago joined rendezvous with for a war-at-sea exercise lasting until 8 September, before returning to Subic for a lengthy upkeep period. Repainting the exterior, and interior improvements lasted until 27 September, when the cruiser got underway for home. Stopping at Guam on 1 October to refuel, and Pearl Harbor on 9 October for a dependents cruise, the ship finally returned to San Diego on 16 October. Chicago at sea during her 1977-78 WESTPAC cruise Chicago in the Coral Sea, October 1979 The cruiser remained in port, receiving boiler repairs and equipment upgrades, until 23 February when the ship began post-repair sea trials and crew training. Following inspections, and ordnance loadout at Seal Beach on 3 March, Chicago began a regular schedule of training operations out of San Diego. These exercises, including helicopter pad training, simulated missile and torpedo attacks, and other similar drills, continued until 6 September, when the ship got underway for her eighth WestPac tour. Chicago arrived in Subic Bay on 30 September, after multi-ship exercises that included four missile shots while underway, to begin a series of operations with the 7th Fleet. Missile shots and convoy exercises off Mindoro, a barrier exercise off Buckner Bay, and visits to Yokosuka, Keelung, and Hong Kong lasted until late November. On 4 December, after a rendezvous with Kitty Hawk, the cruiser began operations in the Sea of Japan. Helicopter and underway replenishments were interrupted two days later, when the formation was circled by two Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 \\"Badgers\\", but exercises continued until 8 December. Departing the area, Chicago steamed south to Subic Bay, for sonar exercises with the submarine , arriving at Singapore on 23 December. After the holidays, the cruiser moved to Phattaya Bay, Thailand on 30 December. Departing 4 January 1978, the cruiser visited Subic Bay and Hong Kong before starting a month of exercises in the Philippine Sea. Gunfire exercises, helicopter operations, unreps, and other drills, including a real man overboard rescue on 28 February, lasted until 4 March, when Chicago moored at Manila. After repairs and upkeep, the ship steamed for Guam on 16 March, arriving five days later to refuel, before arriving in Pearl Harbor on 31 March. After returning to San Diego on 7 April, the ship remained in upkeep status until 24 July 1978, when the cruiser moved to Long Beach to start a regular overhaul. Repairs at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard lasted until 18 October, when the cruiser conducted two days of sea trials. Finishing work continued until 25 October, when Chicago departed the shipyard. After two days of operations with the destroyer and submarine , the cruiser moved back to San Diego to begin a regular schedule of training exercises. These short cruises, concentrating on gunnery and underway training, lasted through February 1979. A number of propulsion and electronic service inspections were also conducted. On 5 March, during exercises off southern California, the cruiser also earned her eleventh consecutive Missile \\"E\\". Chicago alongside at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Puget Sound in 1990 USS Chicago Anchor on display at Navy Pier After a monthlong pre-deployment period, the ship departed on 30 May for her final cruise to the Western Pacific. Chicago escorted the aircraft carrier and her battle group to Pearl Harbor, conducting exercises with the cruiser , frigate , and auxiliary vessel along the way, before steaming on to Subic Bay on 13 June. Fleet exercises off Okinawa, and a port visit to Pusan, South Korea, at the end of July, were followed by refugee surveillance in the South China Sea. There, along with other 7th Fleet ships, she helped rescue Vietnamese refugees fleeing the mainland, picking up five herself. Escort duties for Kitty Hawk continued through September when, on 6 October, she sailed for Australia. On 15 October, after memorial services for two cruisers lost in the Solomon Islands battles during World War II, and the earlier , the cruiser began two weeks of exercises in the Coral Sea. After the exercise, involving seven U.S. ships and twenty Australian and New Zealand vessels, the ship visited Sydney, Australia, for a week-long port visit, then departed for the west coast via Subic Bay and Pearl Harbor, and arrived at San Diego on 17 December. While fiscal year 1980 funding for a thorough overhaul and modernization was approved by Congress, an inspection classified the cruiser as unfit for further economical naval service, and on 1 March 1980, Chicago was decommissioned at San Diego. Towed to the Inactive Ship Facility at Bremerton, Washington, the ship was held in reserve until 8 February 1989. Stripped of equipment by 11 August, the hulk was sold for scrap to Southwest Recycling, Inc., Terminal Island, California, on 9 December 1991. The anchor was saved and placed on display at Navy Pier on 11 November 1995.U.S.S. Chicago Anchor Awards *She was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for her efforts in developing the PIRAZ concept on her Western Pacific cruises in 1966 and 1967-68. *In 1972, the cruiser was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for Vietnam Service, the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy, and her seventh consecutive \\"E\\" for excellence in missilery.

He played 12 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Philadelphia Athletics. Early years Skeeter Webb was born in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1909. He attended the University of Mississippi, where he joined Sigma Nu. Professional baseball career =St. Louis Cardinals= He began his major-league career on July 20, 1932, with the St. Louis Cardinals at the age of 23. He appeared in only one game in 1932, and did not have a plate appearance. =Minor leagues= Webb did not make another major-league club for six years. From 1932 to 1937, Webb played for six minor-league clubs, including the Springfield Senators (1932-1933), Cedar Rapids Raiders (1935-1936), and Columbus Red Birds (1932 and 1937). He compiled a career-high .320 batting average in 472 at bats with Cedar Rapids in 1935. =Cleveland Indians= In April 1938, he signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians. In 1939, he played in 81 games at shortstop for the Indians and had a .264 batting average, the highest of his major-league career. He also appeared in 39 games with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in 1939. =Chicago White Sox= Traded to the Chicago White Sox in January 1940, he was moved to second base, where he played 74 games. His batting average dropped to .237 in 1940, and he was relegated to the role of a utility infielder and back-up second baseman in 1942 and 1943. However, with the major-league talent pool depleted, Webb won the job as the Sox' starting shortstop in 1944. However, he hit only .211 in 513 at bats for the 1944 White Sox. =Detroit Tigers= Traded to the Detroit Tigers at the end of the 1944 season, Webb was the Tigers' starting shortstop in their 1945 World Series championship season. Skeeter played 104 games at shortstop for the 1945 Tigers, but proved to be a liability at bat. His batting average dropped to .199 in 1945, as Webb got only 81 hits in 407 at bats. Despite his weak hitting performance in the regular season, Webb played all seven games of the 1945 World Series as the Tigers' shortstop. He hit .185 in the World Series, going 5-for-27, though he did score five runs. In game 7, Webb had his best performance, scoring two runs and fielding the final out of the series. After the Series, one sports writer singled out Web for the following praise: > \\"During the regular season, Webb was not a standout performer with the > Tigers. He was a fair fielder but a weak hitter. No one who has followed the > Tigers closely this year would have been surprised if Webb had buckled under > the strain of World Series competition. However, instead of buckling, Webb > played better than any infielder on either club. He made a number of > dazzling plays and not a single error. In addition, he hit the ball harder > and with more effectiveness than he ever did during the American League > campaign.\\" In 1946 and 1947, Webb stayed with the Tigers as a backup second baseman. =Philadelphia Athletics= He finished his major league career playing in 23 games for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1948, where he hit a career-low .148. He played in his final game on August 31, 1948. =Toronto Maple Leafs= During the 1949 season, Webb played for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League.

He served as ambassador to the United States, Russia, and the Netherlands. He served as the second Governor General of the Province of Canada from 1841 to 1843. Early life, family, education, political career He was the second son of William Bagot, 1st Baron Bagot of Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire. He was educated at Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford. He entered Lincoln's Inn, where he studied law, but left and returned to Oxford to complete his master's degree. His marriage to the wealthy Mary Charlotte Anne Wellesley-Pole, the niece of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, and other Bagot family connections made possible his subsequent diplomatic career. Bagot served as Member of Parliament for Castle Rising from 1807 to 1808. Diplomatic career =Ambassador to United States= He was named minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinaire to the United States on 31 July 1815, in the aftermath of the War of 1812. With Richard Rush, he negotiated the Rush‚ÄìBagot Treaty to limit naval forces on the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. He also contributed to negotiations leading to the Anglo- American Convention of 1818, which defined the border between British North America and the United States from Lake of the Woods (see Northwest Angle) to the Pacific Ocean. Bagot ended his term in Washington, D.C. in 1820. =Ambassador to Russia, Netherlands= He subsequently served as British Ambassador to Russia, where he took part in negotiations leading to the 1825 Treaty of Saint Petersburg. Then, he served as British Ambassador to the Netherlands, where he was involved in negotiations leading to the establishment of Belgium in 1831. Colonial administrator =Governor General of Canada= After a hiatus of ten years from diplomatic service, Bagot agreed to succeed Lord Sydenham as governor general of the newly proclaimed Province of Canada. He was chosen because of his diplomatic knowledge of the United States. Bagot was appointed 27 September 1841, and arrived in the Canadian capital Kingston on 10 January 1842, taking office two days later. Bagot was ordered by the British government to resist the strengthening demands for responsible government. As an important concession, however, Bagot did allow the leading Canadian colonial politicians Robert Baldwin and Sir Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine to form a ministry, on the basis of their parliamentary majority. Lafontaine, as a French-Canadian leader, had suffered abusive treatment by the British under the previous governor general, Lord Sydenham, who had died in office in 1841. This was the beginning of what became known as representative government in Canada. Bagot's leadership was an important step forward in establishing more amicable relations between the colonizing British and French. Bagot worked productively with Baldwin and Lafontaine to establish a structure for fair municipal governance in the province of Canada. Their work has stood the test of time. With the arrival of Confederation in 1867, a well-defined system of three-tiered governance‚Äîfederal, provincial, and municipal‚Äîcame into being in Ontario and Quebec. While serving as governor-general, Bagot ordered the first criminal extradition of a fugitive slave to the United States from Canada West. The fugitive in question, Nelson Hacket (or Hackett), had been valet and butler to a wealthy Arkansas slave owner. In 1841, Hacket stole a beaver overcoat and a racing mare from his master, as well as a gold watch and a saddle from two others, and fled to Canada West. Hacket's master caught up with him in Chatham, Ontario, and Hacket was jailed. Governor-General Bagot ruled Hacket had committed a crime by stealing items not necessary for his escape, and for this reason he was extradited. The public in Canada West, as well as abolitionists in the U.S. and Canada, were dismayed, and their displeasure led to a formal treaty, which codified rules for extradition, but upset fugitives, abolitionists, and slave owners. In 1842 Bagot initiated a major review of government policies and expenditures related to Indigenous peoples in Canada East and Canada West, appointing Rawson W. Rawson, John Davidson and William Hepburn as report commissioners. Completed in 1844, the final report, titled the Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada, included a call for the introduction of industrial schools to address the noted failure of day schools to effectively keep Indigenous children from the influence of their parents and is regarded as a foundational document in the rationale for establishing the Canadian Indian residential school system. =University administrator= He served as Chancellor of King's College, (now the University of Toronto), 1842‚Äì1843. =Death= Having resigned his governor general's office in January 1843, Bagot died four months later at the vice-regal residence, Alwington House, Alwington, Kingston, too ill to return to the United Kingdom. =Legacy= Today, he is chiefly remembered for his contributions to the development of the \\"undefended border\\" between the United States and Canada, and for fostering more cooperative and positive political relations between the two main colonial groups of British and French settlers. Bagot Street, a main thoroughfare in downtown Kingston, is named in his memory. Family Lady Mary Charlotte Ann Bagot from a miniature by Hoppner, R.A. Right Hon. Sir Charles Bagot, Bart., G.C.B., married Lady Mary Charlotte Anne Wellesley, daughter of William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington on 22 July 1806. The couple had three sons and five daughters. The family accompanied their parents to Canada, on the appointment of Sir Charles Bagot as Governor-General of British North America on 12 January 1842. As the wife of a Governor-General in Canada, Lady Bagot assumed the title of \\"Her Excellency\\" in Montreal in August 1842. After her husband's death at Kingston, Ontario, on 18 May 1843, she accompanied his remains to England. She died in London on 2 February 1845.

Potential evaporation (PE) or potential evapotranspiration (PET) is defined as the amount of evaporation that would occur if a sufficient water source were available. If the actual evapotranspiration is considered the net result of atmospheric demand for moisture from a surface and the ability of the surface to supply moisture, then PET is a measure of the demand side. Surface and air temperatures, insolation, and wind all affect this. A dryland is a place where annual potential evaporation exceeds annual precipitation.  Estimates of potential evaporation  = Thornthwaite equation (1948) = PET = 16 \\\\left(\\\\frac{L}{12}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{N}{30}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{10T_d}{I}\\\\right)^{\\\\alpha} Where PET is the estimated potential evapotranspiration (mm/month) T_d is the average daily temperature (degrees Celsius; if this is negative, use 0) of the month being calculated N is the number of days in the month being calculated L is the average day length (hours) of the month being calculated \\\\alpha = (6.75 \\\\times 10^{-7}) I^3 - (7.71 \\\\times 10^{-5}) I^2 + (1.792 \\\\times 10^{-2}) I + 0.49239 I = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{12} \\\\left(\\\\frac{T_{m_{i}}}{5}\\\\right)^{1.514} is a heat index which depends on the 12 monthly mean temperatures T_{m_{i}}. Somewhat modified forms of this equation appear in later publications (1955 and 1957) by Thornthwaite and Mather. = Penman equation (1948) = The Penman equation describes evaporation (E) from an open water surface, and was developed by Howard Penman in 1948. Penman's equation requires daily mean temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and solar radiation to predict E. Simpler Hydrometeorological equations continue to be used where obtaining such data is impractical, to give comparable results within specific contexts, e.g. humid vs arid climates. = Penman‚ÄìMonteith equation (1965) = The Penman‚ÄìMonteith equation equation refines weather based potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates of vegetated land areas. It is widely regarded as one of the most accurate models, in terms of estimates. =Priestley‚ÄìTaylor= The Priestley‚ÄìTaylor equation was developed as a substitute to the Penman‚ÄìMonteith equation to remove dependence on observations. For Priestley‚ÄìTaylor, only radiation (irradiance) observations are required. This is done by removing the aerodynamic terms from the Penman‚ÄìMonteith equation and adding an empirically derived constant factor, \\\\alpha. The underlying concept behind the Priestley‚ÄìTaylor model is that an air mass moving above a vegetated area with abundant water would become saturated with water. In these conditions, the actual evapotranspiration would match the Penman rate of potential evapotranspiration. However, observations revealed that actual evaporation was 1.26 times greater than potential evaporation, and therefore the equation for actual evaporation was found by taking potential evapotranspiration and multiplying it by \\\\alpha. The assumption here is for vegetation with an abundant water supply (i.e. the plants have low moisture stress). Areas like arid regions with high moisture stress are estimated to have higher \\\\alpha values. The assumption that an air mass moving over a vegetated surface with abundant water saturates has been questioned later. The lowest and turbulent part of the atmosphere, the atmospheric boundary layer, is not a closed box, but constantly brings in dry air from higher up in the atmosphere towards the surface. As water evaporates more easily into a dry atmosphere, evapotranspiration is enhanced. This explains the larger than unity value of the Priestley-Taylor parameter \\\\alpha. The proper equilibrium of the system has been derived and involves the characteristics of the interface of the atmospheric boundary layer and the overlying free atmosphere.

Its primary aim was to study hypothesis formation and discovery in science. For that, a specific task in science was chosen: help organic chemists in identifying unknown organic molecules, by analyzing their mass spectra and using knowledge of chemistry.November, 2006 It was done at Stanford University by Edward Feigenbaum, Bruce G. Buchanan,Oral history interview with Bruce G. Buchanan, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota. Joshua Lederberg, and Carl Djerassi, along with a team of highly creative research associates and students.Lederberg, 1987 It began in 1965 and spans approximately half the history of AI research.Lindsay et al., 1980 The software program Dendral is considered the first expert system because it automated the decision-making process and problem-solving behavior of organic chemists. The project consisted of research on two main programs Heuristic Dendral and Meta-Dendral, and several sub-programs. It was written in the LISP programming language, which was considered the language of AI because of its flexibility. Many systems were derived from Dendral, including MYCIN, MOLGEN, PROSPECTOR, XCON, and STEAMER. There are many other programs today for solving the mass spectrometry inverse problem, see List of mass spectrometry software, but they are no longer described as 'artificial intelligence', just as structure searchers. The name Dendral is an acronym of the term \\"Dendritic Algorithm\\". Heuristic Dendral Heuristic Dendral is a program that uses mass spectra or other experimental data together with knowledge base of chemistry, to produce a set of possible chemical structures that may be responsible for producing the data. A mass spectrum of a compound is produced by a mass spectrometer, and is used to determine its molecular weight, the sum of the masses of its atomic constituents. For example, the compound water (H2O), has a molecular weight of 18 since hydrogen has a mass of 1.01 and oxygen 16.00, and its mass spectrum has a peak at 18 units. Heuristic Dendral would use this input mass and the knowledge of atomic mass numbers and valence rules, to determine the possible combinations of atomic constituents whose mass would add up to 18. As the weight increases and the molecules become more complex, the number of possible compounds increases drastically. Thus, a program that is able to reduce this number of candidate solutions through the process of hypothesis formation is essential. New graph-theoretic algorithms were invented by Lederberg, Harold Brown, and others that generate all graphs with a specified set of nodes and connection-types (chemical atoms and bonds) -- with or without cycles. Moreover, the team was able to prove mathematically that the generator is complete, in that it produces all graphs with the specified nodes and edges, and that it is non-redundant, in that the output contains no equivalent graphs (e.g., mirror images). The CONGEN program, as it became known, was developed largely by computational chemists Ray Carhart, Jim Nourse, and Dennis Smith. It was useful to chemists as a stand-alone program to generate chemical graphs showing a complete list of structures that satisfy the constraints specified by a user. Meta-Dendral Meta-Dendral is a machine learning system that receives the set of possible chemical structures and corresponding mass spectra as input, and proposes a set of rules of mass spectrometry that correlate structural features with processes that produce the mass spectrum. These rules would be fed back to Heuristic Dendral (in the planning and testing programs described below) to test their applicability. Thus, \\"Heuristic Dendral is a performance system and Meta-Dendral is a learning system\\". The program is based on two important features: the plan- generate-test paradigm and knowledge engineering. =Plan-generate-test paradigm= The plan-generate-test paradigm is the basic organization of the problem-solving method, and is a common paradigm used by both Heuristic Dendral and Meta-Dendral systems. The generator (later named CONGEN) generates potential solutions for a particular problem, which are then expressed as chemical graphs in Dendral. However, this is feasible only when the number of candidate solutions is minimal. When there are large numbers of possible solutions, Dendral has to find a way to put constraints that rules out large sets of candidate solutions. This is the primary aim of Dendral planner, which is a ‚Äúhypothesis-formation‚Äù program that employs ‚Äútask-specific knowledge to find constraints for the generator‚Äù. Last but not least, the tester analyzes each proposed candidate solution and discards those that fail to fulfill certain criteria. This mechanism of plan-generate-test paradigm is what holds Dendral together. =Knowledge Engineering= The primary aim of knowledge engineering is to attain a productive interaction between the available knowledge base and problem solving techniques. This is possible through development of a procedure in which large amounts of task-specific information is encoded into heuristic programs. Thus, the first essential component of knowledge engineering is a large ‚Äúknowledge base.‚Äù Dendral has specific knowledge about the mass spectrometry technique, a large amount of information that forms the basis of chemistry and graph theory, and information that might be helpful in finding the solution of a particular chemical structure elucidation problem. This ‚Äúknowledge base‚Äù is used both to search for possible chemical structures that match the input data, and to learn new ‚Äúgeneral rules‚Äù that help prune searches. The benefit Dendral provides the end user, even a non-expert, is a minimized set of possible solutions to check manually.  Heuristics  A heuristic is a rule of thumb, an algorithm that does not guarantee a solution, but reduces the number of possible solutions by discarding unlikely and irrelevant solutions. The use of heuristics to solve problems is called \\"heuristics programming\\", and was used in Dendral to allow it to replicate in machines the process through which human experts induce the solution to problems via rules of thumb and specific information. Heuristics programming was a major approach and a giant step forward in artificial intelligence, as it allowed scientists to finally automate certain traits of human intelligence. It became prominent among scientists in the late 1940s through George Polya‚Äôs book, How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method. As Herbert A. Simon said in The Sciences of the Artificial, \\"if you take a heuristic conclusion as certain, you may be fooled and disappointed; but if you neglect heuristic conclusions altogether you will make no progress at all.\\"  History  During the mid 20th century, the question \\"can machines think?\\" became intriguing and popular among scientists, primarily to add humanistic characteristics to machine behavior. John McCarthy, who was one of the prime researchers of this field, termed this concept of machine intelligence as \\"artificial intelligence\\" (AI) during the Dartmouth summer in 1956. AI is usually defined as the capacity of a machine to perform operations that are analogous to human cognitive capabilities.Berk, 1985 Much research to create AI was done during the 20th century. Also around the mid 20th century, science, especially biology, faced a fast-increasing need to develop a \\"man- computer symbiosis\\", to aid scientists in solving problems.Lederberg, 1963 For example, the structural analysis of myogoblin, hemoglobin, and other proteins relentlessly needed instrumentation development due to its complexity. In the early 1960s, Joshua Lederberg started working with computers and quickly became tremendously interested in creating interactive computers to help him in his exobiology research. Specifically, he was interested in designing computing systems to help him study alien organic compounds. As he was not an expert in either chemistry or computer programming, he collaborated with Stanford chemist Carl Djerassi to help him with chemistry, and Edward Feigenbaum with programming, to automate the process of determining chemical structures from raw mass spectrometry data. Feigenbaum was an expert in programming languages and heuristics, and helped Lederberg design a system that replicated the way Djerassi solved structure elucidation problems. They devised a system called Dendritic Algorithm (Dendral) that was able to generate possible chemical structures corresponding to the mass spectrometry data as an output. Dendral then was still very inaccurate in assessing spectra of ketones, alcohols, and isomers of chemical compounds. Thus, Djerassi \\"taught\\" general rules to Dendral that could help eliminate most of the \\"chemically implausible\\" structures, and produce a set of structures that could now be analyzed by a \\"non-expert\\" user to determine the right structure. The Dendral team recruited Bruce Buchanan to extend the Lisp program initially written by Georgia Sutherland. Buchanan had similar ideas to Feigenbaum and Lederberg, but his special interests were scientific discovery and hypothesis formation. As Joseph November said in Digitizing Life: The Introduction of Computers to Biology and Medicine, \\"(Buchanan) wanted the system (Dendral) to make discoveries on its own, not just help humans make them\\". Buchanan, Lederberg and Feigenbaum designed \\"Meta-Dendral\\", which was a \\"hypothesis maker\\". Heuristic Dendral \\"would serve as a template for similar knowledge- based systems in other areas\\" rather than just concentrating in the field of organic chemistry. Meta-Dendral was a model for knowledge-rich learning systems that was later codified in Tom Mitchell's influential Version Space Model of learning. Notes References # Berk, A A.

Overview  Freedom of thought is the precursor and progenitor of‚Äîand thus is closely linked to‚Äîother liberties, including freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. Though freedom of thought is axiomatic for many other freedoms, they are in no way required for it to operate and exist. The conception of a freedom or a right does not guarantee its inclusion, legality, or protection via a philosophical caveat. It is a very important concept in the Western world and nearly all democratic constitutions protect these freedoms. For instance, the Bill of Rights contains the famous guarantee in the First Amendment that laws may not be made that interfere with religion \\"or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\\". U.S. Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo reasoned in Palko v. Connecticut (1937): Such ideas are also a vital part of international human rights law. In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which is legally binding on member states of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), \\"freedom of thought\\" is listed under Article 18: The United Nations' Human Rights Committee states that this, \\"distinguishes the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief from the freedom to manifest religion or belief. It does not permit any limitations whatsoever on the freedom of thought and conscience or on the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of one's choice. These freedoms are protected unconditionally\\". Similarly, Article 19 of the UDHR guarantees that \\"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference\\". History of development and suppression It is impossible to know with certainty what another person is thinking, making suppression difficult. The concept is developed throughout the Bible, most fully in the writings of Paul of Tarsus (e.g., \\"For why should my freedom [eleutheria] be judged by another's conscience [suneideseos]?\\" 1 Corinthians 10:29).Eugene J. Cooper, \\"Man's Basic Freedom and Freedom of Conscience in the Bible : Reflections on 1 Corinthians 8‚Äì10\\", Irish Theological Quarterly Dec 1975 Bronze statue of Giordano Bruno, Campo de' Fiori, Rome Although Greek philosophers Plato and Socrates had discussed Freedom of Thought minimally, the edicts of King Ashoka (3rd century BC) have been called the first decree respecting Freedom of Conscience. In European tradition, aside from the decree of religious toleration by Constantine I at Milan in 313, the philosophers Themistius, Michel de Montaigne, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Voltaire, Alexandre Vinet, and John Stuart Mill and the theologians Roger Williams and Samuel Rutherford have been considered major proponents of the idea of Freedom of Conscience (or 'soul liberty' in the words of Roger Williams).Luzzatti, p. 91. Queen Elizabeth I revoked a thought censorship law in the late sixteenth century, because, according to Sir Francis Bacon, she did \\"not [like] to make windows into men's souls and secret thoughts\\". During her reign, philosopher, mathematician, astrologer, and astronomer Giordano Bruno took refuge in England from the Italian Inquisition, where he published a number of his books regarding an infinite universe and topics banned by the Catholic Church. After leaving the safety of England, Bruno was eventually burned as a heretic in Rome for refusing to recant his ideas. For this reason, he is considered by some to be a martyr for free thought. However, freedom of expression can be limited through censorship, arrests, book burning, or propaganda, and this tends to discourage freedom of thought. Examples of effective campaigns against freedom of expression are the Soviet suppression of genetics research in favor of a theory known as Lysenkoism, the book-burning campaigns of Nazi Germany, the radical anti- intellectualism enforced in Cambodia under Pol Pot, the strict limits on freedom of expression imposed by the Communist governments of the People's Republic of China and Cuba or by left-wing authoritarian dictatorships such as those of Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Francisco Franco in Spain. Fascism has always been product of the left though it is falsely thought to be product of the right when it is erroneous to suggest so as illustrated by Ayn Rand. The Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis, which states that thought is inherently embedded in language, would support the claim that an effort to limit the use of words of language is actually a form of restricting freedom of thought. This was explored in George Orwell's novel 1984, with the idea of Newspeak, a stripped- down form of the English language alleged to lack the capacity for metaphor and limiting expression of original ideas. More recently, the development of neuroimaging technologies have raised concerns about entities being able to read and subsequently suppress thought. Although the issue is complicated by the mind-body problem, these concerns form the emerging field of neuroethics and neuroprivacy.

She is best known for her roles in C.A.T.S. Eyes (1985‚Äì1987), the BBC sitcom Men Behaving Badly (1992‚Äì1997), ITV drama Where the Heart Is (2000‚Äì2003), and BBC medical drama Holby City (2009‚Äì2010). Her book My Life Behaving Badly: The Autobiography was published in 2007. Early career Ash was born in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and first appeared on British television in 1964 at the age of four asking \\"Mummy, why are your hands so soft?\\" in an advertisement for the washing-up product Fairy Liquid. She was educated at the independent Italia Conti Academy stage school, and then started a career as a fashion model appearing on the cover of a number of teenager magazines, including Pink, and Jackie, for which she was photographed by David Bailey. Having appeared with her sister Debbie in the 1978 British slapstick comedy Rosie Dixon ‚Äì Night Nurse; her first major film role was playing the romantic lead in Quadrophenia in 1979. In 1980, Ash appeared in the Iron Maiden music video, \\"Women in Uniform\\". In 1982 she played the role of a fast food chef in the fifth series of Shelley (TV series) entitled \\"When the Chip hits the Fan\\". In 1983, she had the starring role in The Balance of Nature (1983), a film about a Cockney girl from a tower block with aspirations to win the Miss United Kingdom competition.‚ÄùThe Diary: will Colin consider it?‚Äù in The Stage (London, England), Thursday 05 May 1983, p. 15 The same year, she played Julie Morgan, alias Juletta Shane, in Curse of the Pink Panther. In 1983, she also appeared opposite Nicky Henson as Nancy in the ITV situation comedy The Happy Apple playing a secretary whose opinions successfully reflected public opinion. She then played a regular role in crime series C.A.T.S. Eyes. In 1987, Ash appeared in the first episode of the third series of the ITV Home to Roost. The episode was entitled Human Interest, and Ash played the role of the flamboyant cleaner, Susie Perkins. Ash's best known role was playing Neil Morrissey's romantic interest Deborah (Debs) in the situation comedy Men Behaving Badly. She continued in the role for six series. She subsequently acted in BBC police drama Merseybeat and the ITV drama Where the Heart Is. In 1996, during her time on Men Behaving Badly, Leslie released a single \\"Tell Him\\" with co-star Caroline Quentin, under the name of \\"Quentin & Ash\\". It reached number 25 in the UK singles chart. Later work Ash appeared in BBC Radio 4's comic radio series, Vent (2007), alongside Neil Pearson, Fiona Allen and Josie Lawrence. In May 2008, Ash worked with Transparent Television to make a documentary about the unregulated cosmetic beauty industry whilst exploring her own experiences. The programme, Leslie Ash: Face to Face was broadcast on ITV on 23 September 2008. In 2009, Ash appeared on daytime TV panel programme Loose Women to discuss her new role in Holby City and her previous health problems. Leslie reappeared on Loose Women on 17 February 2012 where she discussed her new on stage tour of All the Single Ladies where she stars alongside Brooke Kinsella and Tara Flynn. In 2014, Leslie was a contestant on the BBC programme, Celebrity Masterchef. Personal life Ash is married to former footballer Lee Chapman, and they have two sons. Her sister is former 'Hot Gossip' dancer Debbie Ash. They appeared together as sisters in Rosie Dixon ‚Äì Night Nurse. =Health problems= Ash contracted toxoplasmosis two months into her pregnancy in France, where it is more common than the United Kingdom. She told the BBC that she wished to raise awareness of the issue in Britain. Ash was hospitalised at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in April 2004 after suffering two cracked ribs, saying she fell off a table during frantic Kama Sutra sex with her husband. She was discharged after a few days, but was readmitted after losing all feeling in her legs. In June 2004 while she was still in hospital, it was announced that a Staphylococcus aureus infection might have rendered her permanently unable to walk. In January 2007 Ash confirmed she was suing the hospital. Papers lodged at the High Court asserted that Ash would never return to active TV roles. The hospital admitted breach of duty over part of her treatment but denied responsibility for the extent of her injuries and in January 2008 paid out a record ¬£5m compensation in an out-of-court settlement. Steve Walker, chief executive of the NHS Litigation Authority, said the payout set a new record for compensation following a hospital-acquired infection. The previous highest amount was ¬£500,000. The payment was justified by the NHS compensation body as being \\"because of the amount Leslie was earning at the time she fell ill and takes into account how much she might have earned in the future\\". =Lip implants= In her thirties, Ash had a collagen injection to 'plump up' her lips. When she was forty she decided to repeat the procedure with the same plastic surgeon, the mother of a Venezuelan friend. In the second procedure, liquid silicone was injected resulting in extreme swelling of her lips, a condition dubbed as \\"trout pout\\" in the press. Subsequent medical analysis showed that the silicone had set and the condition is permanent. During this time Ash starred in a series of advertisements for the DIY chain Homebase (again, with Neil Morrissey) and starred in Merseybeat, which evoked further ridicule from the media about her appearance. Ash has since spoken out about the press ridicule she received as a result of her botched implants, commenting: \\"If I'd lost a leg in a car crash, people wouldn't have felt able to take the mickey out of me so mercilessly....People don't laugh at Heather Mills because she lost a leg.\\" News of the World legal action Ash and Chapman sued the News of the World for breach of privacy over suspicions that their voicemails, and those of their two sons, were illegally accessed by private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire. They wrote to the police over their suspicions, and the police informed them that there were four pieces of paper referring to Ash in Mulcaire's notebooks, and five items relating to Chapman. There were further items relating to their children. In August 2011, Ash and Chapman settled a claim against the paper and Mulcaire for an undisclosed sum and received an apology. They planned to take action against other newspapers.

However, the marriage ended when Clitherow divorced Sarah in 1819, by private Act of Parliament.Charles Rogers, Genealogical Memoirs of the Scottish House of Christie (London: Royal Historical Society, 1878), pp. 22-25.John Clitherow's Divorce from Sarah Clitherow, 59 Geo. III (1819), c. 71. In 1825, Clitherow married Millicent Pole of Gloucestershire.  Military career  Clitherow enlisted in the British Army as an ensign in 1799. He served in the Egyptian campaign of 1801, an expedition to Germany in 1805, and an expedition to the Netherlands in 1809. He participated in the Peninsular War from 1810 to 1815, being wounded twice. He was promoted to colonel in 1821, and to major- general in 1830.\\"John Clitherow (1782-1852)\\", Qu√©bec Dictionary of Parliamentary Biography, from 1764 to the present, In 1838, Clitherow was posted to British North America, to serve as commanding officer of the military district of Montreal. He was accompanied by his son, who served as his aide-de-camp. Clitherow arrived in Montreal in March, 1838, shortly after the Lower Canada Rebellion had broken out in late 1837. He served as an advisor to Lord Durham as a member of the Special Council that administered Lower Canada following the rebellion. When the second rebellion broke out Clitherow commanded 3,000 regulars that marched on rebel headquarters. He also presided over courts martial that prosecuted the rebels. In 1841, he was transferred to Canada West to command British forces there.  Deputy Governor General  The Governor General of the Province of Canada, Lord Sydenham, appointed him as Deputy Governor General. In that capacity, on September 18, 1841, Clitherow prorogued the first session of the first Parliament of the Province of Canada.\\"Clitherow, John\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography. Sydenham was unable to carry out his functions, as he had been badly injured by a fall from a horse. He died the day after Parliament was prorogued.\\"Thomson, Charles Edward Poulett 1st Baron Sydenham\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography. Clitherow remained the Deputy Governor General for six days, until the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Canada, Sir Richard Downes Jackson, was appointed as Administrator.J.O. C√¥t√©, Political Appointments and Elections in the Province of Canada, 1841 to 1860 (Quebec: St. Michel and Darveau, 1860), p. 9. Retirement and death  In 1842, Clitherow inherited the family estate, Boston Manor in Brentford, England. He retired to England that year. Clitherow died at Boston Manor in 1852.

Flinkman is a fictional character on the television series, Alias. Flinkman, portrayed by Kevin Weisman, is the tech geek at SD-6 and then later the CIA. When a field agent is sent on a mission, Marshall serves in a function similar to Q from the James Bond films: as the in-house creator and proprietor of a number of gadgets and sophisticated tools used by field agent. UGO.com named him one of the best TV nerds. Characterization Marshall has a quirky and eccentric personality, which contrasts with the stern nature of those around him. He is also socially inept, having a tendency to speak very rapidly, often babbling about tangential subjects in the middle of technical briefings (before someone impatiently brings Marshall back on to the topic at hand). He is always dressed well and wears his hair in a slick sidepart. He has a fondness for unnecessary visual aids when giving a presentation, once even playing a full drum set to make a point (actor Weisman is in a rock band). However, his expertise in almost any subject imaginable is unparalleled, being well-versed in robotics, chemistry, acoustics, electronics, biometrics, explosives, computer networks, and many other subjects. He also has an eidetic memory. Storylines Like Sydney, he initially believes SD-6 is a black ops division of the CIA. Because he is not a field agent, he often doctors photographs of himself in exotic locations to fool his mother into thinking he works for a company requiring a lot of travel; he once asked Sydney to take the photographs for said images. When SD-6 is destroyed, Marshall is brought into the CIA for real. Unlike his colleague Marcus Dixon, he adjusts to the change easily and soon becomes a valued member of the team. Starting in the second season, Marshall found a love interest, an NSA agent with similar geekish tendencies, Carrie Bowman. Eventually the two got married and had a child, Mitchell. During the third season, Marshall experiences great character growth, realizing most people do not understand quantum entanglement, understanding how he appears to others and offering suggestions for operations (which are implemented without comment). At the conclusion of the third season, Marshall is shot and seriously wounded by Lauren Reed. By the start of the fourth season (several months later in the timeframe of the series), he has fully recovered from his injuries and is recruited into the new Authorized Personnel Only (APO) black ops offshoot of the CIA (albeit as a 'late' addition to the organization, when they realized that they needed his computer expertise early in their first assignment). Marshall serves as comic relief for the Alias series, but he has some serious moments when he is worried about those he cares about, including Sydney, but mostly revolving around Carrie and Mitchell. Marshall has also discovered how hard it is to lie to those he loves, having to keep his job at APO a secret even from his wife (who appears to no longer be working for the NSA by the fourth season). Marshall rarely works as a field operative, and then only when his expertise in computers is required. This was a key factor in the two-part storyline in the second-season episodes \\"The Abduction\\" and \\"A Higher Echelon\\", where Marshall accompanied Sydney to hack a classified database on-site and was subsequently abducted by a terrorist cell seeking the same information, requiring Sydney to return him to SD-6 when she had made arrangements for him to be picked up by the CIA and told the truth about Sloane and SD-6 after that mission was over. In the fourth season episode \\"Tuesday\\", Marshall is forced to go on a solo mission to rescue Sydney, buried alive somewhere in Cuba, after the rest of APO is incapacitated when a biological agent released by an enemy forces a lockdown of headquarters. Marshall, delayed in arriving at HQ due to a problem with his baby, avoids being caught in the lockdown and becomes the only APO agent able to save Sydney. Later in the mission, when required to make contact with an enemy agent while APO was still on lockdown and the man had already met Sydney, he accidentally shoots and kills the agent while attempting to keep him occupied while Sydney tracks a crucial item in his possession; it is not made clear whether this is the first time Marshall has killed anyone. The fifth season was largely business as usual for Marshall, although he has also struck up a friendship-cum-mutual admiration society with new APO recruit Rachel Gibson, who had primarily served as a data analyst for current foe Gordon Dean before his true agenda was exposed, although she alternated between taking a field role and acting as Marshall's assistant in the office. The series finale saw Marshall return briefly to the field as part of APO's efforts to capture intel on Prophet Five. He was later kidnapped from his home by Kelly Peyton and tortured, resisting admirably until at Sydney's urging he cooperated as part of a plan to rescue him and the also-abducted Rachel, allowing him to pass on a discreet message that would help his wife Carrie track his online activity and identify his location. Marshall continued to provide tech support as the various members of APO raced around the world to thwart the endgames of Arvin Sloane and Irina Derevko, including remotely inputting the codes to stand down missiles Irina had targeted on Washington, D.C. and London. In a flash forward at the very end of the final episode, it is revealed Marshall and Carrie have two more children and Carrie is pregnant with their fourth. Carrie Bowman Carrie Bowman, played by Amanda Foreman, is an NSA agent and wife of Marshall Flinkman. Carrie is introduced in Season 2, where she worked at the CIA headquarters in Los Angeles with Marshall. Eventually the two formed a relationship resulting in marriage and the birth of their son, Mitchell. This, of course, happened in typical Marshall fashion. The two decided they were to be wed before the birth of the baby, but Carrie began to go into labor in the middle of an important mission. Marshall quickly enlists Eric Weiss to become legally ordained online (through the \\"Internet Church of Mammals\\") so he can marry the two (while Marshall continues to guide Sydney and Vaughn through their mission), bolting at the last second to take his wife to the hospital. Carrie is strong-willed and tends to get her way in disputes with her husband, and though she tries to keep him in check with her quick wit and sarcasm, they ultimately balance each other out and love one another deeply. Beginning in the fourth season, Carrie seems to have given up her NSA job to take care of Mitchell. She is unaware Marshall still works for the CIA, since APO is black ops and he is under orders to keep it secret. She only appeared in one fourth season episode (\\"Tuesday\\"), and prior to the series finale appeared in one episode during the fifth season (\\"...1...\\"). For the series finale, Carrie learned Marshall was still with the CIA when he was kidnapped by agents of Arvin Sloane. She worked with APO to rescue Marshall and the also-abducted Rachel, demonstrating technical prowess rivalling Marshall's, quickly understanding a discreet clue Marshall passed to Sydney that allowed her to track their location from the source of the digital activity. In the flash forward several years into the future presented at the end of the series finale, it is mentioned Marshall and Carrie have two more children after Mitchell, with another on the way, and all are boys.

Fortress America was the fourth of five games in the Gamemaster series. Overview Set in the 21st century, the board game begins with the premise that during the Cold War, nuclear terrorists destroyed much of the Middle East's supply of oil. In response, the United States launched into orbit a satellite based solar-power system to solve the energy crisis. At the same time, the U.S. had perfected the so- called \\"Star Wars\\" technology and incorporated a satellite-based laser system into the solar satellites. This system was capable of destroying intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) before impact. Thus, the USA was completely safe from nuclear threat, ending the era of Mutual Assured Destruction. This creates a great deal of political turmoil - the USSR is especially upset at the nuclear balance of power being shifted - and while the rest of the world realigns in various ways (through alliances and treaties as well as conventional military conflict) the United States, complacent in its technical superiority, becomes isolationist in nature. The game opens with the world divided into three major world powers outside of the US: 1) The Asian Peoples Alliance (yellow player) 2) The Central American Federation (blue player) 3) The Euro-Socialist Pact (red player) These three powers have launched a surprise invasion of the now-conventionally-weak United States: Asian invaders on the Pacific coast, Central American invaders along the Southwestern border with Mexico, and the Euro-Soviet invaders along the Eastern Seaboard. The United States Navy is brushed aside. The Army and Air Force, still capable of resistance, are nevertheless insufficient to halt the multi-pronged invasions. The unique nature of this game is the notion of three of four players cooperating for the elimination of one player (the US). The game has an interesting dynamic of the US player being outnumbered 3:1 in military strength but steadily being reinforced by laser relay towers which each have a 60% chance to destroy an enemy unit anywhere on the board each turn. The rules of combat also favor the defender. Also, the invaders must place their reinforcements, which arrive on an even basis over the first few turns and then run out entirely, in their own invasion zones, which are sometimes far from the front, while the U.S. never runs out and can often be reinforced right at the front. The American player receives reinforcements by drawing two cards per turn, which sometimes specify for partisans or military forces to appear behind enemy lines. Others allow the U.S. to reconstruct shattered units from the dead pile in home cities, while all invading units are permanently out of play when lost in combat. The result is a game that - if played well by all players - will result in a very close contest. There are 30 cities represented on the board and the invaders must capture, and hold until the end of an entire turn, 18 or more of them to win the game. This allows the U.S. one round to counterattack and recapture after all the invaders have played a round and temporarily achieved their goal of 18. Original Milton Bradley release Commercially, this was considered to be the third most successful board game in Milton Bradley's Gamemaster Series placing it in the middle of the pack. However, world events and popular culture and Hollywood have influenced a small resurgence in the game's popularity evidenced by the 2012 remake and re-issue. The original game also had two different covers. The first had an image which resembled Saddam Hussein and the other cover replaced the Saddam look-a-like with a bearded and sunglasses-wearing version. =Reception= In 1987, Fortress America won the Charles S. Roberts Award for Best 20th Century Game of 1986. Fantasy Flight Game Release In 2012 Fantasy Flight Games released a remake of Fortress America with a few design changes. A few new rule changes have been implemented. The game now has a fixed maximum number of turns. Mechanized units can \\"transport\\" foot units. A few objectives were changed on the map. Reflecting population shifts, Kansas City and Buffalo are no longer depicted, Las Vegas and Colorado Springs have been added, plus resource areas were juggled. The attackers have optional event cards. A few of the old cards were changed, and one new \\"free laser complex\\" card was added for a total of 31 cards.

It is the largest county in the province by population with 82,017 (2016), land area, and highest average income. Charlottetown is the county seat of Queens County, and is the largest city and the capital of Prince Edward Island. The county is located in the centre of Prince Edward Island, and the geography varies from relatively flat plains to rolling hills in the central interior lands known as the Bonshaw Hills. The coastline features sandstone cliffs and sandy beaches, with numerous sheltered bays on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Northumberland Strait. The most important geographic feature of Queens County is the Hillsborough River and its extensive estuary, which almost cuts both the county and Prince Edward Island in half. Queens County was formed in 1765, and was named by Captain Samuel Holland in honour of Charlotte of Mecklenburg- Strelitz, then queen consort of the United Kingdom. Historically the economy of the county has been primarily agricultural, similar to rest of Prince Edward Island. Today, the county is characterised by urban sprawl extending from Charlottetown in the centre of the county is the region's most dominant feature; many rural parts of the county within the Charlottetown census agglomeration, and outside, are facing increased pressures to subdivide and develop into suburbs and exurbs. Stratford, a suburb of Charlottetown located south-east across the Hillsborough River, is the third-largest community in Prince Edward Island. Queens County is the only county in Prince Edward Island to have experienced population growth since 2011, with a change of +5.3% from 77,866 recorded in the Canada 2011 Census.

Early life Henry Clay Folger Jr. was born in New York City to Henry Clay Folger Sr. of Nantucket, Massachusetts and Eliza Jane (Clark) Folger of New York, the oldest of their eight children. He was a first cousin six times removed of Benjamin Franklin and a nephew of J. A. Folger, the founder of Folger Coffee. He is descendant of Peter Foulger (the maternal grandfather of Benjamin Franklin) and Mary Morrill Foulger. He prepared at Adelphi Academy, Brooklyn, New York, where he was acquainted with Charles Pratt, the businessman and president of the Adelphi board of trustees who became a mentor to Folger. At Adelphi, Folger was schooled in art, chemistry, classics, and recitation, and was elected president of the school's literary association. He then attended Amherst College with Charles Millard Pratt, a close friend who was the son of Folger's mentor from the Adelphi Academy. To fund his education, Folger participated in many oratorical essay contests; he won prizes for competitions in 1876 and 1879, the latter of which paid for his junior year of school. Folger modeled his rhetorical style on Daniel Webster's. He identified a Shakespeare-related essay contest as the origin of his obsession with the Bard. Emily, however, later attributed the origin of Folger's fascination with Shakespeare to an 1879 lecture by Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose elegant and eloquent delivery sounded Shakespearean to the college student. Folger was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1879. After Amherst, he attended Columbia Law School from 1879 to 1881, and was admitted to the bar in 1881. Folger in 1879, the year he graduated from Amherst College Career Beginning in 1881, he worked for the Standard Oil trust of John D. Rockefeller, getting his start in the oil business as a clerk at Charles Pratt & Company, a refinery owned by Charles Pratt, the father of his Adelphi and Amherst classmate Charles Millard Pratt. The Pratt Company was already associated with Standard Oil at that time.Lynch, Kathleen, \\"Folger, Henry Clay,\\" American National Biography, John Garatty and Mark Carnes (eds.) New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Volume 8, pp. 169‚Äì170. Folger quickly showed his prowess as a mathematician and statistician; his management of data on oil processing led to a promotion in 1886, when he became the secretary of Standard Oil's manufacturing committee. In 1890, Folger wrote Petroleum: Its Production and Products in Pennsylvania, an article for Chambers's Encyclopaedia about the oil business. Folger's assets increased in 1899, when he was promoted to chairman of the manufacturing committee, the same year that Standard Oil of New Jersey became the central holding company for the Standard Oil Trust, which dissolved after the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The stock Folger held in Standard Oil of New Jersey would contribute significantly to Folger's ability to collect Shakespeareana. In 1908, he was elected assistant treasurer of Jersey Standard, and joined its board of sixteen directors, managing the company's finances and compiling production data. That year, Folger was also elected to Jersey Standard's executive committee. The 1911 Supreme Court decision to break up the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey monopoly resulted in the election of Folger as president of the second-largest company formed from the dissolved Jersey Standard, the Standard Oil Company of New York, or Socony. Folger also owned significant amounts of stock in the Magnolia Petroleum Company, a Texan company that became a fully owned subsidiary of Socony in 1925. He retired as president in 1923, but stayed at Socony as the first chairman of its board of trustees until 1928, when he officially retired to devote all of his attention to plans for his Shakespeare Library. Folger was succeeded as president by Herbert L. Pratt, another son of Charles Pratt. In 1956, the Folger Shakespeare Library received Folger's walnut desk from Socony Mobil Oil. Since that year, it has been used by the Library's director. Marriage to Emily Clara Jordan Henry Clay Folger met Emily Clara Jordan in the early 1880s at a meeting of the Irving Literary Circle in Brooklyn. Both were close, respectively, with the Pratt siblings Charles and Lillie. Early in their relationship, Henry and Emily connected via Shakespeare. At an 1882 picnic held by the Irving Literary Circle, Charles and Lillie prompted the two to each give a toast; Emily drew from Othello. while Henry quoted from As You Like It. She was born in 1858 and was educated at Vassar College. They married on October 6, 1885 at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Emily had spent her teenage years. The Folgers had no children. They lived in rented houses in Brooklyn throughout most of their lives, moving to Bedford-Stuyvesant in 1895 and to 24 Brevoot Place in 1910, but later purchased an estate in Glen Cove, Long Island in 1929. The Folgers took annual vacations to The Homestead resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, where Henry enjoyed participating in golf tournaments in his later years. Though the Folgers had no children, they considered their collection to be their descendants, and Henry was known to refer to his rare books as \\"the boys.\\" Shakespeare collecting Folger was an avid collector of Shakespeareana, assembling the world's largest collection of First Folio editions of Shakespeare's plays.The Library in the New Age, an article by Robert Darnton The first rare book Folger acquired was a 1685 copy of the Fourth Folio, purchased in 1889 for $107.50. He purchased his first original copy of the First Folio four years later, in 1893. Unlike other wealthy collectors of the period, like Henry E. Huntington and J.P. Morgan, Folger favored \\"imperfect\\" copies of rare volumes, with their marginalia and other markings. Following this trend, his Folio collection was marked with diversity in provenance and condition. He preferred to purchase Early Editions of books published between 1567 and 1606, in addition to manuscripts of the period. Based on their collective knowledge of Latin and French, and Emily's proficiency in German, the couple also favored rare volumes published on the Continent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The couple was less interested in art collection, and many of the Shakespeare-related paintings they purchased were misattributed to artists like Thomas Gainsborough. The Folgers chose items to purchase from booksellers' catalogues, which were initially perused and marked up by Emily, before she passed them on to Henry, who kept an extensive and precise list of items he intended to bid on. If possible, he inspected an item personally before purchasing it. He also avoided consulting scholarly experts about rare volumes, preferring his own and Emily's expertise, as she received an M.A. from Vassar College in 1896 for a thesis on Shakespeare. Folger used professional booksellers as middlemen at auctions, believing that the concealment of his identity would keep prices low. Due to the growing size of the collection and their concern for fireproofing, eventually few of the Folgers' acquisitions were stored in their living space. They kept an extensive card catalog at home in Brooklyn, and when traveling, took a smaller, annotated set of check lists along with them. The collection itself was stored among several fireproof warehouse companies throughout Manhattan, in specially-designed wooden cases originally meant to hold two five-gallon cans of oil each. Frederick Fales, a co-worker of Folger's at Standard Oil, initially designed and ordered these air-tight wooden cases for company use.Grant, pp. 111‚Äì118. Some of the most valuable items were kept in bank vaults, or in a safe in Folger's office. Folger financed a half-century of collecting with his Standard Oil salary and extensive investments in the company. His high placement at Standard Oil also allowed him to take out loans with his friend Charles Millard Pratt, John D. Rockefeller, and even his wife, to fund his purchases. He generally paid for items in cash, a strategy that earned him the favor of many booksellers who needed immediate funds. Folger also preferred to purchase whole collections, like the Halliwell-Phillipps collection, acquired in 1908, because bulk purchases drove down prices of individual items. In 1909, Folger established a Shakespeare Prize at Amherst; winning students won a cash prize, and their essays joined Folger's collection and currently reside in the Folger Shakespeare Library. Folger also made donations to Amherst College's library, contributing many duplicate volumes purchased at auction to the College. The most valuable of these donations were two leaves from a Gutenberg Bible. Folger Shakespeare Library Early in his career at Standard Oil and as a collector, Folger doubted that he would eventually have the funds to build a memorial or library for his growing collection, and in 1895 he offered to sell it to John D. Rockefeller, who refused. Before he acquired the funds for what was to become the Folger Shakespeare Library, Folger also debated selling the collection to a university. Toward the end of World War I, Folger and his wife began searching for a location for his Shakespeare library. Among the sites he and Emily considered were Amherst and Nantucket, Massachusetts, the University of Chicago, New York City, and Stratford-upon-Avon, before they settled on a Washington, D.C. site they discovered in 1918 during a layover in the city while traveling to Hot Springs. Folger spent nine years purchasing the fourteen row houses that occupied the block of East Capitol Street between First and Second Streets, which he would demolish to build his Library; thus, they did not make their choice of a site on Capitol Hill public until 1928. Soon afterwards, Congress passed a resolution allowing use of the land on East Capitol Street where the Folger Shakespeare Library now stands. After the passage of this legislation, Folger hired Paul Philippe Cret as the Library's architect, suggested by Alexander Trowbridge, an architect who had married into the Pratt family and stayed on the project as consulting architect. Folger played an integral part in the design and execution of the Library's classical exterior and Tudor interior. The inclusion of an Elizabethan theater within the Library's main building was also Folger's idea, though he intended it as a venue for academic lectures rather than performances. Folger hired sculptor John Gregory to design the relief sculptures that appear on the building's facade. The cornerstone of the library was laid in 1930, but Henry Folger died soon afterward. The bulk of his fortune was left in trust for the library, with Amherst College as trust administrator. With additional funding from Emily Folger, the library opened in 1932 on April 23, the date traditionally believed to be Shakespeare's birthday. Folger's collection of Shakespearean works is considered one of the most important resources for scholars of the playwright. Other interests and activities Central Congregational Church Folger was a trustee of the Hamilton Trust Company, Brooklyn, New York, and a director of Seaboard National Bank in New York. In 1914 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Amherst. Outside of work, his great interests were his Shakespeare collection and, in later life, golf, which he often played with Rockefeller.Lynch, p. 170. He was a trustee of the Central Congregational Church in Brooklyn and established the Shakespeare Garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.Brooklyn Botanic Garden: Shakespeare Garden In a 1933 lecture delivered after his death, Emily identified King Lear as his favorite of Shakespeare's plays. Death In May 1930, Henry Folger was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn for surgery on an enlarged prostate. While recovering, he continued to work on the construction and development of his Shakespeare Library from his sickbed. He later had a second prostate operation prior to his death on June 11, 1930. His funeral was held at Brooklyn's Central Congregational Church, where he had been an active member.Grant, p. 163. Reverend Samuel Parkes Cadman, who, along with his wife, had been close with the Folgers, gave Henry's eulogy.Mays, Andrea. The Millionaire and the Bard. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2015, p. 256. Henry's ashes were interred beneath the Folgers' copy of Shakespeare's funerary monument in what is now the Folger Shakespeare Library's Old Reading Room. His wife Emily died in 1936.

It is based on fundamental misconceptions about the physiology of the human skull and is promoted as a cure-all for a variety of health conditions. CST was invented in the 1970s by John Upledger, an osteopathic physician, as an offshoot of cranial osteopathy, which had been devised in the 1930s by William Garner Sutherland. CST is a pseudoscience, and its practice has been characterized as quackery. Medical research has found no good evidence that either CST or cranial osteopathy confers any health benefit, and they can be harmful, particularly if used on children or infants. The basic assumptions of CST are not true, and practitioners produce conflicting and mutually exclusive diagnoses of the same patients. Effectiveness and safety Practitioners of CST claim it is effective in treating a wide range of conditions, sometimes claiming it is a cancer cure, or a cure-all. Practitioners particularly advocate the use of CST on children. The American Cancer Society caution that CST should never be used on children under age two. Pediatricians have expressed concern at the harm CST can cause to children and infants. CST is potentially harmful. There have been cases of people with head injuries suffering further injury as a result of CST. If used as an alternative for legitimate therapy for a serious condition, choosing CST can have serious adverse consequences. According to the American Cancer Society, although CST may relieve the symptoms of stress or tension, \\"available scientific evidence does not support claims that craniosacral therapy helps in treating cancer or any other disease\\". Cranial osteopathy has received a similar assessment, with one 1990 paper finding there was no scientific basis for any of the practitioners' claims the paper examined. In October 2012 Edzard Ernst conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials of craniosacral therapy. He concluded that \\"the notion that CST is associated with more than non-specific effects is not based on evidence from rigorous randomised clinical trials.\\" Commenting specifically on this conclusion, Ernst wrote on his blog that he had chosen the wording as \\"a polite and scientific way of saying that CST is bogus.\\" Ernst also remarked that the quality of five of the six trials he had reviewed was \\"deplorably poor\\", a sentiment that echoed an August 2012 review that noted the \\"moderate methodological quality of the included studies.\\" Ernst criticized a 2011 systematic review performed by Jakel and von Hauenschild for inclusion of observational studies and including studies with healthy volunteers. This review concluded that the evidence base surrounding craniosacral therapy and its efficacy was sparse and composed of studies with heterogeneous design. The authors of this review stated that currently available evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions. The evidence base for CST is sparse and lacks a demonstrated biologically plausible mechanism. In the absence of rigorous, well-designed randomized controlled trials, it is a pseudoscience,  * * and its practice quackery.  Tests show that CST practitioners cannot in fact identify the purported craniosacral pulse, and different practitioners will get different results for the same patient. The idea of a craniosacral rhythm cannot be scientifically supported.  Regulation  Edzard Ernst writes that in 2005 in the United Kingdom, a foundation of the Prince of Wales issued a booklet listing CST as one of several popular alternative therapies, but admitting that the therapy was unregulated and lacked either a defined training program or the oversight of a professional body. Ernst writes that this makes the therapists practising CST \\"less regulated than publicans\\".  Technique  The therapist lightly palpates the patient's body, and focuses intently on the communicated movements. A practitioner's feeling of being in tune with a patient is described as entrainment. History and conceptual basis The fundamental concepts of cranial osteopathy and CST are inconsistent with the known anatomy and physiology of the human skull, brain and spine. Edzard Ernst has written \\"to anyone understanding a bit of physiology, anatomy etc. [CST] looks like pure nonsense\\". In common with many other varieties of alternative medicine, CST practitioners believe all illness is caused by energy or fluid blockages which can be released by physical manipulation. They believe that the bones of the skull move in a rhythmic pattern which they can detect and correct. Cranial osteopathy, a forerunner of CST, was originated by osteopath William Sutherland (1873‚Äì1954) in 1898‚Äì1900. While looking at a disarticulated skull, Sutherland was struck by the idea that the cranial sutures of the temporal bones where they meet the parietal bones were \\"beveled, like the gills of a fish, indicating articular mobility for a respiratory mechanism.\\" John Upledger devised CST. Comparing it to cranial osteopathy he wrote: \\"Dr. Sutherland's discovery regarding the flexibility of skull sutures led to the early research behind CranioSacral Therapy - and both approaches affect the cranium, sacrum and coccyx - the similarities end there.\\" However, modern day cranial osteopaths largely consider the two practices to be the same, but that cranial osteopathy has \\"been taught to non-osteopaths under the name CranialSacro therapy.\\" Practitioners of both cranial osteopathy and craniosacral therapy assert that there are small, rhythmic motions of the cranial bones attributed to cerebrospinal fluid pressure or arterial pressure. The premise of CST is that palpation of the cranium can be used to detect this rhythmic movement of the cranial bones and selective pressures may be used to manipulate the cranial bones to achieve a therapeutic result. However, there is no evidence that the bones of the human skull can be moved by such manipulations. From 1975 to 1983, Upledger and neurophysiologist and histologist Ernest W. Retzlaff worked at Michigan State University as clinical researchers and professors. They assembled a research team to investigate the purported pulse and further study Sutherland's theory of cranial bone movement. Upledger and Retzlaff went on to publish their results, which they interpreted as support for both the concept of cranial bone movement, and the concept of a cranial rhythm. Later independent reviews of these studies concluded that they presented no good evidence for the effectiveness of craniosacral therapy or the existence of the proposed cranial bone movement.

He established a new city, Chiang Mai, as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom (1296‚Äì1558).Wyatt, D. K. Thailand, A Short History, p. 35‚Äì38, Bangkok 2003'King Mangrai of Lan Na' in: Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, Ancient Chiang Mai Volume 1. Chiang Mai, Cognoscenti Books, 2012. Early years King Mangrai was born on October 2, 1238 in Ngoen Yang (present day Chiang Saen) Thailand on the Mekong River, a son of the local ruler Lao Meng and his wife Ua Ming Chom Mueang, a princess from the Tai Lue city of Chiang Rung, which is now called Jinghong, in Sipsongpanna (Xishuangbanna), China. In 1259, Mangrai succeeded his father to become the first independent king of the unified Tai city states in northern Lanna and what is now northern Laos. Seeing the Tai states were disunited and in danger, Mangrai quickly expanded his kingdom by conquering Muang Lai, Chiang Kham and Chiang Khong and initiating alliances with other states. In 1262, he founded the city of Chiang Rai as his new capital in the Kok River basin. He also seems to have been operating around this time in the area of Fang in the Upper Kok Valley. In 1287, Mangrai first made peace between King Ngam Muang of Phayao and King Ram Khamhaeng of Sukhothai, who had seduced the former's queen. The three Kings then entered a \\"Strong pact of friendship\\". While still living in the area of Fang he was visited by merchants from the Mon kingdom of Haripunchai (Haripunjaya, now known as Lamphun). Hearing of the wealth of that kingdom, he determined to conquer it, against the advice of his counselors. As it was thought impossible to take the city by force, Mangrai sent a merchant named Ai Fa as a mole to gain the confidence of its King Yi Ba. In time, Ai Fa became the Chief Minister and managed to undermine the King's authority. In 1291, with the people in a state of discontent, Mangrai defeated the Mon kingdom and added Haripunchai to his kingdom. Yi Ba, the last king of Hariphunchai, was forced to flee south to Lampang. Chiang Mai Era After defeating the Hariphunchai kingdom, Mangrai decided to relocate his capital, and in 1294, Wiang Kum Kam was founded on the eastern bank of the Ping River.http://www.gsid.nagoya-u.ac.jp/bpub/research/public/paper/article/168.pdf The site was plagued with floods, and a new site was chosen several kilometres to the northwest at the foot of Doi Suthep, on the site of an older fortified town of the Lua people.http://coe.cseas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/research/sea/social/hayashi/Hayashi_Unnan_9Aroonrut.htm Construction of Chiang Mai (lit. \\"New City\\") began in 1296. and it has been the capital of the northern provinces more or less ever since. A few years later, Yi Ba's son, King Boek of Lampang, attacked Chiang Mai with a large army. King Mangrai and his second son, Prince Khram, led the defence against the Lampang army. Prince Khram defeated King Boek in personal combat on elephant-back at Khua Mung, a village near Lamphun. King Boek fled by way of the Doi Khun Tan mountain range between Lamphun and Lampang, but he was caught and executed. King Mangrai's troops occupied the city of Lampang, and King Yi Ba was made to flee further south, this time to Phitsanulok. Death and succession King Mangrai's eldest son grew tired of waiting and tried to seize the throne, but his attempt failed and he was executed. Mangrai's second son, Khun Kham, was then named to succeed Mangrai. King Mangrai died in 1311 in Chiang Mai. According to tradition, he was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm when he was in the city's market.http://chiangmai- temple.blogspot.nl/2008/08/wat-jao-mangrai.html Mangrai's death was followed by period of confusion, with six kings ruling in the next eleven years. This could have been disastrous if the northern powers had not had their own troubles. Sukhothai to the south had also been weakened. Not until the ascension of the Mangrai's grandson, Kham Fu, in 1328 did the kingdom achieve the stability it had had during the lifetime of its founder.

He is one of Sydney Bristow's CIA co-workers. Character biography Eric Weiss was a field agent at the CIA. He is a friend of most of the people at the CIA and often gives advice to the other characters, as an outside observer to all of the personal goings-on at the CIA. Weiss has a wry and sarcastic sense of humor which often comes out in his observations. He often walks into or defuses tense situations between Sydney and Vaughn. He is a descendant of Harry Houdini (whose real name was Ehrich Weiss [or Weisz]). He initially served as a humorous foil and sounding board for Michael Vaughn in the first season, but with the integration of the former members of SD-6 and the CIA, he gives advice to many of the other characters, including Sydney and Marshall Flinkman. When Marshall's fianc√©e, Carrie Bowman, went into labor at CIA headquarters, she insisted on being married before the baby was born. Marshall quickly accessed the website for the dubious \\"Internet Church of Mammals\\" and obtained for Weiss the post of \\"Exalted Minister\\", which allowed him to officiate at the impromptu wedding. Weiss has played ice hockey in goal against Vaughn but really seems to like bowling (4.05 Liberty Village) because of the cheesy disco music, glow in the dark pins and all you can eat hot dogs after ten. He loves food, Sydney once commented the looked great and he said he'd given up all the food he enjoyed. Weiss was the only member of Sydney's CIA \\"family\\" who wasn't recruited into the black-ops division of the CIA, dubbed \\"APO,\\" at the start of the fourth season, but this was soon rectified when he learned of the existence of APO during a mission in the third episode of the season. Although there was the potential of a relationship beginning with Sydney Bristow during the third season, nothing developed. They were just good friends, Weiss gave Sydney a third edition Alice in Wonderland to try to make up for the loss of all her stuff in her apartment fire at the end of the second season. At the start of the fourth season, Weiss began a relationship with Sydney's half-sister, Nadia Santos. In the second episode of season 4, upon meeting Nadia for the first time, he introduced himself as 38 and single. In the second episode of the fifth season: \\"...1...\\" Eric Weiss was offered a job coordinating covert operations for the NSC, which was only a \\"few steps from the President\\"; at the end of the episode Weiss accepted the promotion and left the series. The character returned one final time in \\"S.O.S.\\" when he used his high ranking position to extract a team of APO agents who had infiltrated CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. In one episode he is heard speaking Dutch while on the telephone. He also speaks Spanish, French, and Russian but not as well as other field agents.

He was born in Grand Narrows, Nova Scotia. He was a member of the North British Society. Despite his later political longevity, Murray's early political career was marked by inability to get elected. He lost five consecutive elections at the federal and provincial level before finally winning a seat. Despite his electoral failures he was highly regarded within the Liberal Party and was nominated by Premier William Stevens Fielding to succeed him when Fielding left provincial politics in 1896 to join the federal cabinet of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Murray was sworn in as premier and took a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly when he was acclaimed as a candidate in Victoria County. George Henry Murray by Edmund Wyly Grier, Province House (Nova Scotia) As premier, Murray was a practitioner of brokerage politics. His government continued the public works projects of his predecessor, particularly in the area of railways (doubling the province's track mileage within a decade), as well as road and bridge construction. Murray's government was instrumental in improving the province's post-secondary education system, particularly in the area of agricultural and vocational education through the founding of the Nova Scotia Agricultural College at Bible Hill as well as the Nova Scotia Technical College in Halifax. In 1906, the Liberals instituted prohibition. The Murray government also introduced workers compensation in 1916 and instituted women's suffrage in 1918. The Murray government also introduced progressive labour legislation such as the Factories Act in 1908 and workman's compensation for injuries on the job in 1915. In the area of public health the Murray government appointed public health officers, establishing county health clinics and founded a research hospital for tuberculosis patients. After almost three decades in power Murray retired from politics in January 1923. He twice declined the offer of knighthood and twice refused earlier offers to join the federal cabinet of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He died in Montreal.

It was the first federal armory and one of the first factories in the United States dedicated to the manufacture of weapons.Smith, Robert F. \\"Manufacturing Independence: Industrial Innovation in the American Revolution.\\" Westholme Publishing, August 2016. The site is preserved as the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, Western Massachusetts' only unit of the national park system. It features the world's largest collection of historic American firearms.Springfield Armory National Historic Site ‚Äì Springfield Armory National Historic Site. Nps.gov (2013-08-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-21. Famous first as the United States' primary arsenal during the American Revolutionary War, and then as the scene of a confrontation during Shays' Rebellion, the Springfield Armory in the 19th and 20th centuries became the site of numerous technological innovations of global importance, including interchangeable parts, the assembly line style of mass production, and modern business practices, such as hourly wages. The facility would play a decisive role in the American Civil War, producing most of the weaponry used by Union troops which, in sum, outpaced Confederate firearm production by a ratio of 32 to 1. American historian Merritt Roe Smith has posited that advancements in machine manufacturing which allowed the facility to increase production capacity by more than 25 fold, from 9,601 rifles in 1860 to 276,200 in 1864, served as a precursor to the mass production of the Second Industrial Revolution and 20th century assembly line production. The numerous firearm models produced at the Springfield Armory from 1794 to 1968 are referred to as \\"Springfield muskets and rifles\\".  Founding (1777)  Local and colonial militia used the bluff on which the Springfield Armory would become located during the 17th century for militia training, particularly after the Attack on Springfield during King Philip's War. In 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, George Washington scouted and approved the site of the Springfield Armory, after it was referred to him by General Henry Knox, his artillery chief. Although a small town at the time, Springfield, Massachusetts, offered obvious geographical advantages‚Äîit lay at the intersection of three rivers (including the major Connecticut River), and four major roads headed toward New York City, Boston, Albany, and Montreal. Additionally, Springfield is located just north of the Connecticut River's first waterfall (Enfield Falls), which is too steep to be navigated by ocean- going vessels. Thus, Springfield was the first town on the Connecticut River protected from attack by seafaring naval vessels. The Armory site itself sits atop a high bluff like a citadel, overlooking a wide stretch of the Connecticut River, at its confluence with the Westfield River. General Knox concurred with Washington that \\"the plain just above Springfield is perhaps one of the most proper spots on every account\\" for the location of an arsenal. In 1777, patriot colonists established \\"The Arsenal at Springfield\\" to manufacture cartridges and gun carriages for the war effort. During the Revolution, the arsenal stored muskets, cannon, and other weapons. Patriots built barracks, shops, storehouses, and a magazine. Some doubt exists that the colonists manufactured arms during the Revolutionary War. After the war, the Army kept the facility to store arms for future needs. By the 1780s, the Springfield Arsenal functioned as a major ammunition and weapons arsenal. Some time later, when manufacturing became important, the arsenal expanded to a second area south and west in Springfield, where water power was available. Around that time, the Mill River was dammed to form a mile-long lake called Watershops Pond. The main shops were behind the dam and a foundry was built below it. This factory was modernized, and the greater part of machining for Springfield and Garand rifles was conducted in it. President George Washington appointed David Ames as first superintendent of the armory. His father Capt. John Ames was a blacksmith who had provided guns to the Colonial army.  Shays' Rebellion (1787)  Shays' rebel forces, attempting to overtake the armory, flee from the state militia as grape shot is fired from artillery In 1786 and 1787, American Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led an armed, populist uprising that attempted to overthrow the Government of Massachusetts. On January 25, 1787, thousands of Shays' Regulators marched on the Springfield Armory, hoping to seize its weaponry and force a change of government. That day the Springfield Armory was defended by state militia, who fired grape shot at the rebels, forcing them to flee. This confrontation proved decisive, as Shays' Rebellion was crushed soon thereafter, and some of its participants tried for treason. Shays' Rebellion directly influenced the delegates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Washington citing it as his reason for coming out of retirement. During the debates over the U.S. Constitution, in encouraging a stronger Federal government, James Madison cautioned the attendees that \\"the rebellion in Massachusetts is a warning, gentlemen.\\" Production (1795‚Äì1968) Conflagration of Part of the US Armory, Springfield, Mass. March 2nd, 1824 =Early years= In 1793, the National Arsenal contained brass ordnance, howitzers, traveling carriages, shot strapt, canisters filled, quilted grape, iron shot, shells, powder, musket ball, cylinders, caps, paper cartridges, fuzes filled, muskets, swords, various military stores, and implements. In 1795, the Springfield Armory produced the new nation's first musket - the Model 1795 Musket which was largely patterned after the French Charleville musket which had armed the French army during the American Revolution. =Early 19th Century= Model 1861 rifles, with capacity to hold 1,100 when fully stocked; these racks are so-called \\"organs\\" as they were described as such in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's lamentations against the wastes of war in his poem The Arsenal at Springfieldthumbleft The Armory played a major role in providing weapons for the American Army during the War of 1812. Its monthly reports to the War Department are online, and they indicate it made 9588 new muskets in 1814 and repaired 5190 old ones that year. It several times reported that its funding had been delayed. Fueled by the Springfield Armory, the City of Springfield quickly became a national center for invention and development. In 1819 Thomas Blanchard developed a special lathe for the consistent mass production of rifle stocks. Thomas Blanchard worked at Springfield Armory for 5 years. The lathe enabled an unskilled workman to quickly and easily turn out identical irregular shapes. The large drum turned two wheels: a friction wheel that followed the contours of the metal rifle pattern, and the cutting wheel that imitated the movements of the friction wheel to make an exact replica of the pattern in wood. In the 1840s the old flintlock gave way to a percussion ignition system that increased the reliability and simplicity of longarms. The Springfield Armory was largely involved in the growth and influence of the Industrial Revolution. Much of this grew out of the military's fascination with interchangeable parts, which was based on the theory that it would be easier to simply replace firearm parts than make battlefield repairs. Mass production of truly interchangeable parts demanded greater use of machines, improved gauging, quality control, and division of labor; all characteristics of the Industrial Revolution. From these individual components, the concept of the assembly line was devised. The Springfield Armory also contributed to improved business management techniques. Colonel Roswell Lee, hired as superintendent in 1815, brought centralized authority, cost accounting for payroll, time, and materials, and increased discipline to a manufacturing environment‚Äîall business practices still in use today. In 1843, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow visited the Armory and wrote his poem \\"The Arsenal at Springfield.\\" The anti- war poem described the rows of finished guns, by that point 1,000,000 stockpiled there, stored vertically in open racks: \\"Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms.\\" =Late 19th Century= Springfield 1855 with Maynard tape primer mechanism Springfield 1855 Pistol-Carbine With the destruction of the Harpers Ferry Armory early in the American Civil War, the Springfield Armory was briefly the only government manufacturer of arms, until the Rock Island Arsenal was established in 1862. During this time production ramped up to unprecedented levels ever seen in American manufacturing up until that time, with only 9,601 rifles manufactured in 1860, rising to a peak of 276,200 by 1864. These advancements would not only give the Union a decisive technological advantage over the Confederacy during the war but served as a precursor to the mass production manufacturing that contributed to the post- war Second Industrial Revolution and 20th century machine manufacturing capabilities. American historian Merritt Roe Smith has drawn comparisons between the early assembly machining of the Springfield rifles and the later production of the Ford Model T, with the latter having considerably more parts, but producing a similar numbers of units in the earliest years of the 1913-1915 automobile assembly line, indirectly due to mass production manufacturing advancements pioneered by the armory 50 years earlier. In 1865, Master Armorer Erskine Allin introduced the \\"Allin Conversion,\\" which incorporated the far more advanced design of breech-loading into the now- obsolete muzzleloaders, thereby extending their service life. In 1891 a new function was assigned to the Armory‚Äîit became the army's main laboratory for the development and testing of new small arms. One of the most distinctive elements of the Armory is the fence surrounding the site, which was started after the Civil War and completed in 1890. Unable to find funding for the purchase of a fence, Major James W. Ripley requested obsolete cannons from government storage, some from the Revolutionary War. He had the cannons sent to a local foundry to be melted down. The foundry kept some of the iron as payment, and the remainder was cast into 9-foot palings, formed as pikes and spearheads which were then sunk into a red sandstone base. =Early 20th Century= Bldg. 28's experimental shop, where John Garand developed the first practical semi-automatic rifle for military use, Mechanical presses producing cold-formed steel parts for weaponry in the mid-20th century During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, it was recognized that the Spanish Mauser Model 1893, exhibited characteristics superior to the \\"trapdoor\\" Springfield and Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen rifles carried by the United States troops. On August 15, 1900, Springfield Armory completed an experimental magazine rifle which they believed to be an improvement over the Krag. They fashioned a clip loading magazine rifle in which the cartridges were contained within the stock, preventing damage to an otherwise exposed magazine. It was approved for production in as the Model 1903. Mauser later sued for patent infringement and won royalties from Springfield. By the time that the United States entered World War I, approximately 843,239 standard service Model 1903 rifles had been manufactured. However, this was insufficient to arm U.S. troops for an undertaking of the magnitude of World War I. During the war Springfield Armory produced over 265,620 Model 1903 rifles. In addition, the War Department contracted for production of the M1917 Enfield Rifle to help aid American troops. These, along with the additional 47,251 rifles produced by the Rock Island Arsenal and the weapons already in service, were enough to supply the war effort. During World War I the Springfield Armory produced ‚âà25,000 M1911 pistols before all facilities were dedicated to production of M1903 rifles. In 1919, when John Garand was 31, he came to Springfield, where he worked to develop a semi-automatic rifle. Over the next five years many designs were submitted for the rifle, but none met the army's rigid specifications. In 1924, Garand offered a design that was approved for further testing. This was the famous M1, or \\"Garand rifle\\" as it came to be known. The army adopted the rifle in 1936, and production began the next year. This began what was to become the greatest production effort in the armory's history: during the entire production history of the M1 rifle, the Springfield Armory produced over 4.5 million of them. The M1's accuracy and durability in battle earned it high praise. General Douglas MacArthur reported on the M1 to the Ordnance Department during heavy fighting on Bataan that \\"Under combat conditions it operated with no mechanical defects and when used in foxholes did not develop stoppages from dust or dirt. It has been in almost constant action for as much as a week without cleaning or lubrication.\\" Further testament to the M1s role in combat was given by another well-respected military officer, General George S. Patton, Jr., who reported to the Army Ordnance Department on January 26, 1945, \\"In my opinion, the M1 Rifle is the greatest battle implement ever devised.\\" In the face of overwhelming odds, the capability of the M1 rifle to deliver superior firepower would most often carry the day. =Late 20th Century= The last small arm developed by the Armory was the M14 rifle, which was, essentially, a highly modified version of the M1 Garand. The M14 was produced from 1959 to 1964 and was the U.S. Army's primary combat rifle until being replaced by the M16 rifle gradually from 1964 to 1970. The M14 has evolved over the years into a more modern sniper rifle‚Äîthe M21. By the time the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam War, Springfield Armory developed not only rifles but machine guns for ground and air use, grenade launchers, and associated equipment. Many weapons were not manufactured at the Armory, but plans and specifications were drawn up for the use of private contractors who built them elsewhere, representing an economic shift toward the American private arms industry.  Closure and rebirth as a National Historic Site (1968‚Äìpresent)  Map of the Springfield Armory campus today In 1968, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara announced the closure of the Springfield Armory. Outer portions of the armory were sold off, including the \\"Water Shops\\" production facilities, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Water Shops Armory. The core site was preserved and the property was turned over to the city and state. It is now the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, and is managed and operated by the National Park Service. As of 2011, the 35 acres behind the Springfield Armory (and several of its former buildings) house Springfield Technical Community College (STCC). STCC is the only \\"technical\\" community college in Massachusetts, which aims to continue the legacy of technological innovation at the Springfield Armory site. The Main Arsenal Building and the Commandants House were extensively renovated by Eastern General Contractors of Springfield, MA between 1987 and 1991. The Main Arsenal now houses the Springfield Armory Museum, which includes the Benton Small Arms Collection, one of the largest collections of weaponry. Use of the name \\"Springfield Armory\\" Following the closure of the U.S. Army Springfield Armory in 1968, the L. H. Gun Co. of Devine, Texas, was renamed Springfield Armory, Inc. to capitalize on the name recognition.

The campaign against Aboriginal Tasmanians, known as the Black War, occurred during this term of office. He later served as Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada from 1838 to 1841, and Governor of Bombay from 1842 to 1846. Early life George Arthur was born in Plymouth, England. He was the youngest son of John Arthur, from a Cornish family, and his wife, Catherine, daughter of Thomas Cornish. He entered the army in 1804 as an ensign and was promoted lieutenant in June 1805. He served during the Napoleonic Wars, including Sir James Craig's expedition to Italy in 1806. In 1807 he went to Egypt, and was severely wounded in the attack upon Rosetta. He recuperated and was promoted to captain under Sir James Kempt in Sicily in 1808, and participated in the Walcheren expedition in 1809. Family Lady Eliza Orde Ussher Arthur Major George Arthur married Eliza Orde Ussher, daughter of Lieut.-Gen. Sir John Sigismund Smith, K.C.B., in May, 1814. Lady Arthur lived in Toronto, Ontario 1838‚Äì41 with three of the couple‚Äôs sons and their five daughters. She died in London, England, 14 January 1855. Their daughter Catherine married Sir Henry Bartle Frere after he had been her father's personal secretary for two years in Bombay, and gave birth to the poet Mary Frere. Their son John married Aileen Spring Rice, the granddaughter of Lord Monteagle of Brandon. Honduras In 1814 he was appointed lieutenant governor of British Honduras, holding at the same time the rank of colonel on the staff, thus exercising the military command as well as the civil government. His dispatches about the suppression of a slave revolt in Honduras were seen by William Wilberforce and other philanthropists, and contributed in no slight degree to the 1834 abolition of slavery within the British Empire. Van Diemen's Land Proclamation board incorrectly labelled \\"Governor Davey's Proclamation, 1816\\", depicting Governor Arthur's proclamation c. 1830. In 1823 he was appointed lieutenant governor of Van Diemen's Land (later known as Tasmania). He arrived on the ship with his wife and family on 12 May 1824 and took office on 14 May. At the time Van Diemen's Land was the main British penal colony and it was separated from New South Wales in 1825. It was during Arthur's time in office that Van Diemen's Land gained much of its notorious reputation as a harsh penal colony. He selected Port Arthur as the ideal location for a prison settlement, on a peninsula connected by a narrow, easily guarded isthmus, surrounded by shark-infested seas. Arthur's predecessors had executed no one in Tasmania (capital punishment was carried out in Sydney); he executed 260 in his term of office (some bodies were left hanging for months) He is also associated with the repression and persecution of the Aboriginal population in the conflict known as the Black War. Throughout the 1820s Arthur had instituted various measures to protect settlers from Aboriginal attacks, including the stationing of garrison troops in remote farmhouses and the dispatch of combined military and police teams into the wilderness to track indigenous bands. These proved ineffective, and by 1830 the conflict between Aborigines and settlers had increased. In February 1830 Arthur sought public input on alternative measures to end the fighting; suggestions included a system of rewards for captured Aborigines, and the importation of packs of hunting dogs to \\"set [on] the natives as they would a quail.\\" Arthur himself expressed regret that a treaty was not signed with Aborigines when the colony was established. In its absence, and given the increasing attacks on both side, on 27 August 1830 Arthur obtained Executive Council approval for a declaration of martial law. The centrepiece of Arthur's military efforts would be the Black Line fiasco, which was intended to drive the Aborigines from the colony's grazing land onto isolated peninsulas where they could be controlled. At the beginning of the Black War in 1826 Arthur issued an official statement setting out those situations that would justify settlers using violence: 'If it should be apparent that there is a determination on the part of one or more of the native tribes to attack, rob, or murder the white inhabitants generally, any person may arm, and joining themselves to the military, drive them by force to a safe distance, treating them as open enemies He failed in his attempts to reform the colony and the system of penal transportation with Arthur's autocratic and authoritarian rule leading to his recall in January 1836. By this time he was one of the wealthiest men in the colony. He departed Hobart for England on 30 October 1836. Canada In 1837 Arthur was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order (KCH), given the rank of Major General on the staff. In December 1837 he was appointed lieutenant governor of Upper Canada and took office in Toronto from 23 March 1838. From the very start of his administration, he had to deal with the aftermath of the Upper Canada Rebellion and was instrumental in the execution of Peter Matthews (rebel) and Samuel Lount. In the same year, Upper Canada was invaded by a band of American sympathizers, one of a series of attempts to subvert British authority in Upper and Lower Canada. He failed to address the issues of fixing colonial administration from the influence of Family Compact, and was replaced by Lord Durham while the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada sat betimes. The two colonies were united in 1841. The Lord Sydenham, the first governor-general, asked Sir George Arthur to administer Upper Canada as deputy governor. Arthur agreed, on condition that the service was unpaid. Later in 1841 he returned to England and was created a hereditary baronet in recognition of his services in Canada. India On 8 June 1842, he was appointed governor of the Indian presidency of Bombay, which he retained until 1846. He displayed great tact in the office, as well as ability, and this helped in extending and strengthening British rule in India. He was appointed provisional governor-general, but did not assume office, as he was compelled by ill health to leave India before Lord Hardinge vacated the governor-generalship. Sir George Arthur, during his administration of the affairs of the presidency, perfected the Deccan survey, the object of which was to equalise and decrease the pressure of the land assessment on the cultivators of the Deccan; and gave his hearty support to the project of a railway line from Bombay to Cailian, which may be regarded as the germ of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, while during his administration the reclamation of the foreshore of the island of Bombay was projected. During his tenure, he inaugurated the famous 'Grant Medical College' in Bombay (1846 AD) one of the first three Medical Colleges in India teaching the western medical sciences. The other two being, the Medical College, Bengal (1835 AD) and Madras Medical College (Formerly Madras Medical School in 1835 and later, Madras Medical College in 1850 AD). The hospital for the Grant Medical College, the Jamshedji Jijiboy Hospital was constructed by the Parsee Trust beforehand. Final years On his return to England in 1846, he was made a privy councillor, and in 1853 he received the colonelcy of the 50th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Foot. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1854 and died that September.

Mostly granulated plastic, early mixtures only added carbon powder and iron oxide, however, mixtures have since been developed containing polypropylene, fumed silica, and various minerals for triboelectrification. Toner using plant-derived plastic also exists as an alternative to petroleum plastic. Toner particles are melted by the heat of the fuser, and are thus bonded to the paper. In earlier photocopiers, this low-cost carbon toner was poured by the user from a bottle into a reservoir in the machine. Later copiers, and laser printers from the first 1984 Hewlett- Packard LaserJet, feed directly from a sealed toner cartridge. Laser toner cartridges for use in color copiers and printers come in sets of cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK), allowing a very large color gamut to be generated by mixing.  Composition, size and manufacture  The specific polymer used varies by manufacturer but can be a styrene acrylate copolymer, a polyester resin, a styrene butadiene copolymer, or a few other special polymers. Toner formulations vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from machine to machine. Typically formulation, granule size and melting point vary the most. Originally, the particle size of toner averaged 14‚Äì16 micrometres or greater. To improve image resolution, particle size was reduced, eventually reaching about 8‚Äì10 micrometers for 600 dots per inch resolution. Further reductions in particle size producing further improvements in resolution are being developed through the application of new technologies such as Emulsion-Aggregation. Toner manufacturers maintain a quality control standard for particle size distribution in order to produce a powder suitable for use in their printers. Toner has traditionally been made by compounding the ingredients and creating a slab which was broken or pelletized, then turned into a fine powder with a controlled particle size range by air jet milling. This process results in toner granules with varying sizes and aspherical shapes. To get a finer print, some companies are using a chemical process to grow toner particles from molecular reagents. This results in more uniform size and shapes of toner particles. The smaller, uniform shapes permit more accurate colour reproduction and more efficient toner use.  Clean-up  Toner can be washed off skin and garments with cold water. Hot or warm water softens the toner, causing it to bond in place. Toner fused to skin eventually wears off, or can be partially removed using an abrasive hand cleaner. Toner fused to clothing usually cannot be removed. Unfused toner is easily cleaned from most water-washable clothing. Because toner is a wax or plastic powder with a low melting temperature it must be kept cold while cleaning. Toner particles have electrostatic properties by design and can develop static- electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum cleaner hoses. Because of this and the small particle size, toner should not be vacuumed with a conventional home vacuum cleaner. Static discharge from charged toner particles theoretically may ignite dust in the vacuum cleaner bag or create a small explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by household vacuum cleaner filter bags and can blow through the vacuum motor into the room. So they also can cause overheating by clogging the motor filter and short circuit by their electric conductivity (carbon, iron) when they melt inside the motor. If toner spills into the laser printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conductive hose and a high efficiency (HEPA) filter may be needed for effective cleaning. These are called electrostatic discharge-safe (ESD-safe) or toner vacuums. Similar HEPA- filter equipped vacuums should be used for clean-up of larger toner spills.  Health risks  Muhle et al. (1991) reported that the responses to chronically inhaled copying toner, a plastic dust pigmented with carbon black, titanium dioxide and silica, were also similar qualitatively to titanium dioxide and diesel exhaust. Carbon black, one of the components of toner, is classified as \\"possibly carcinogenic\\" (Group 2B) by the IARC. As a fine powder, toner can remain suspended in the air for some period, and is considered to have health effects comparable to inert dust. It can be an irritant to people with respiratory conditions such as asthma or bronchitis. Following studies on bacteria in the 1970s that raised concerns about health effects resulting from pyrrole, a contaminant created during manufacture of the carbon black used in black toner, manufacturing processes were changed to eliminate pyrrole from the finished product. Research by the Queensland University of Technology has indicated that some laser printers emit submicrometer particles which have been associated in other environmental studies with respiratory diseases. A study at the University of Rostock has found that the microscopic particles in toner are carcinogenic, similar to asbestos. Several technicians who had been working with printers and copiers on a daily basis were observed for several years. They showed increased lung problems. This confirms previous research published in 2006. Research at Harvard University has shown that, during printing, metal-oxide nanoparticles (defined as 100 nanometres and smaller, hence 0.1 micrometres and smaller) are released into the air from toner-based laser printers and multifunction devices. These machines use toner particles that are on average 20 micrometres in overall diameter, but the surfaces of the toner particles themselves carry innumerable tiny metal-oxide nanoparticles.Powell, Alvin. At Harvard Chan School, nano safety is no small concern (interview with Philip Demokritou, October 24, 2018). https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/10/at-harvard-chan-school-nano- safety-is-no-small-concern/ Accessed February 6 2020. These ultra-small metal- oxide nanoparticles are highly bioactive and could cause harm to the lungs and also elsewhere in the body, given that particles 0.1 micrometres and smaller can cross biological membranes (including lung alveoli), thereby gaining access to all organs via blood circulation.Pirela, Sandra V. et al.

This remains an area of active research, with many knowledge gaps.  Packaging  The toner cartridge is a kind of toner container, that is also a consumable component of the printer. The toner container can be a simple pack, for toner storage and transportation, or further, a consumable component of the printer. The most common way to consume toner is with a toner cartridge (or laser toner), as an office supply of a laser printers. = Repackaging = Several toner manufacturers offer toner in wholesale quantities. Typically, bulk loose toner is sold in barrels or 10 kg (22-pound) bags. Toner is then used by a variety of industries in order to provide consumers with a finished laser toner cartridge. Original Equipment manufacturers such as HP and Canon as well as manufacturers of compatible toner cartridges use the toner in the process of manufacturing a brand new OEM cartridge. Remanufacturers of toner cartridges use the bulk toner in the process of creating a remanufactured toner cartridge. Other companies use the toner to provide a toner refill service. Most toner cartridges are available to the average consumer through retail outlets or local remanufacturing operations. Remanufactured and refilled toner cartridges are generally offered at a lower cost than original toner cartridges, having been either wholly remanufactured and then refilled with toner (the more-optimal method) or just refilled with toner (the less-optimal method)..  Environmental considerations  Recycling of pre-consumer waste toner is practiced by most manufacturers. Classifying toner to the desired size distribution produces off-size rejects, but these become valuable feedstocks for the compounding operation, and are recycled this way. Post-consumer waste toner appears primarily in the cleaning operation of the photo-printing machine. In early printers, as much as 20 to 25% of feed toner would wind up in the cleaner sump and be discarded as waste. Improved printer efficiencies have reduced this waste stream to lower levels, although on average 13% of the toner in each cartridge is still wasted. Some printer designs have attempted to divert this waste toner back into the virgin toner reservoir for direct reuse in the printer; these attempts have met with mixed success as the composition of the toner will change by expending fusibles while retaining developer particles. Some consideration and fewer industry attempts have been made to reclaim waste toner by cleaning it and \\"remanufacturing\\" it. Most toner goes to printed pages, a large fraction of which are ultimately recycled in paper recovery and recycling operations. Removal of toner from the pulp is not easy, and toner formulations to ease this step have been reported.Kittelberger, Steve and Sacripante, Guerino, \\"Easily deinkable toner: A solution to the deinking problem for small mills\\". Pulp & Paper Canada. 104:5, (2003) p.37. Hydrolyzable, water-soluble, and caustic-soluble toner resins have been reported, but do not appear to enjoy widespread application. Most paper recycling facilities mix toner with other waste material, such as inks and resins, into a sludge with no commercial use. In the UK, large compatible ink cartridge manufacturers like Jet Tec & Dubaria have implemented toner recycling programs in order to receive back empty cartridges for refilling of HP, Lexmark, Dell, etc. cartridges, as no compatible version is readily available.  Toner-Modified Asphalt Binder  Since toner consists of several copolymers and it is a carbon-based material, it can be used as a useful modifier for the asphalt industry. It has been shown that inclusion of left- over burnt toner enhances the rheological and mechanical properties of asphalt binder, significantly. Such an application can be placed as an environmentally friendly alternative to prevent soil contamination due to the landfilling of waste toner.Notani, M. A., & Mokhtarnejad, M. (2018). Investigating the rheological and self-healing capability of toner-modified asphalt binder. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers-Construction Materials, 1-9. Adding waste toner into asphalt binder and mixture decreases the binder's glass transition temperature and also, in the meantime increase the crystallization temperature as well.Notani, M. A., Moghadas Nejad, F., Fini, E. H., & Hajikarimi, P. (2019). Low-Temperature Performance of Toner-Modified Asphalt Binder.

Lais are short (typically 600‚Äì1000 lines), rhymed tales of love and chivalry, often involving supernatural and fairy-world Celtic motifs.

Oxford UP. 2009 62-63 Zipes reports the earliest recorded lay is Robert Biker's Lai du Cor, dating to the mid- to late-12th century. The earliest of the Breton lais to survive is probably The Lais of Marie de France, thought to have been composed in the 1170s by Marie de France, a French poet writing in England at Henry II's court between the late 12th and early 13th centuries. From descriptions in Marie's lais, and in several anonymous Old French lais of the 13th century, we know of earlier lais of Celtic origin, perhaps more lyrical in style, sung by Breton minstrels. It is believed that these Breton lyrical lais, none of which has survived, were introduced by a summary narrative setting the scene for a song, and that these summaries became the basis for the narrative lais. The earliest written Breton lais were composed in a variety of Old French dialects, and some half dozen lais are known to have been composed in Middle English in the 13th and 14th centuries by various English authors.Claire Vial, \\"The Middle English Breton Lays and the Mists of Origin\\", in Palimpsests and the Literary Imagination of Medieval England, eds.

He is well known for presenting the BBC programme MasterChef from 1990 to 2000 and for being the co-presenter, with Sir David Frost, of the BBC and ITV panel show Through the Keyhole from 1987 until 2003, visiting homes of many UK and US celebrities.  Early life and education  Grossman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on 16 September 1950 and raised in Marblehead, Massachusetts, the son of David K. Grossman, a Jewish antique dealer and Helen Katherine (n√©e Gilman). Many members of his father's family were art and antiques dealers in and around Boston. His cousin was Ram Dass, the spiritual teacher and author. His initial education was at the General John Glover School in Marblehead, and then at Marblehead High School. He graduated from Boston University with a B.A. in history before travelling to the United Kingdom in 1975 to study at the London School of Economics, where he received a master's degree in economic history. He later returned to university at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he studied history of art, and received his MPhil and a PhD.  Career  =Journalism= Grossman became involved with journalism as an undergraduate in Boston writing for a number of ‚Äòunderground‚Äô and music publications including Boston After Dark, Fusion, Vibrations, the New York Review of Rock and Rolling Stone. After graduation from the LSE he joined the staff of Harpers and Queen as Design Editor and subsequently went to work for The Sunday Times as Contributing Editor. He has written for many British newspapers and is a regular contributor to Country Life. While at Harpers & Queen he was also the magazines restaurant critic a pursiot which he continued for thirteen years also writing about restaurants for GQ and The Sunday Times. =Television= Grossman's television career began in 1983 as one of the regular faces on TV- am presenting among other things a short segment, Through the Keyhole, which he devised along with Kevin Sim and David Frost. Through the Keyhole transferred to primetime on ITV in 1987 and scored some of ITV's highest viewing figures for light entertainment. Grossman continued on the show until 2003. He presented Masterchef from 1990 to 2000 and Junior Masterchef as well as a great number of other programmes including Loyd on Location, The History of British Sculpture, and Behind the Headlines. He also presented the BBC Radio 3 series Composers at Home. =Music= Loyd Grossman playing guitar on stage Grossman has a continuing career as a guitarist initially with punk band Jet Bronx And The Forbidden, who reached number 47 in the UK singles chart in December 1977 with \\"Ain't Doin' Nothing\\". He returned to playing music in 2008 at the Vienna Rebellion Punk Festival. He subsequently formed a new band, The New Forbidden, with Valentine Guinness. The New Forbidden have appeared at Glastonbury eight times. Grossman also appears as a guest artist with Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull when they play their annual concerts in aid of English cathedrals. =Food= In 1995, Grossman introduced his own brand of cooking sauces which became the most successful UK celebrity sauce brand. The sauces are produced by arrangement with Premier Foods. In 2000, he was asked to head a project to improve the quality of food served in British NHS hospitals. Although some newspapers reported that the project had a ¬£40 million budget, Grossman pointed out in a Nursing Times interview that almost all of that money was earmarked for the ward housekeeping programme. He was disappointed that there seemed to be little real money or political will to change hospital catering. =Heritage and the arts= Grossman's lifelong interest in history, the arts and heritage has involved him in a number of organisations. He is a former commissioner of the Museums and Galleries Commission, a former commissioner of English Heritage (where he was chairman of the Museums Advisory Committee and the Blue Plaques Panel), and of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. He was a founding member of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, past chairman of the National Museums Liverpool, deputy chairman of Liverpool European Capital of Culture, chairman of Culture Northwest and of the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association. He founded the 24 Hour Museum (now Culture24). He was chairman of the University for the Creative Arts from 2008 to 2012 and a member of the Court of Governors of the LSE from 1996 to 2009 and is now an emeritus governor. He was deputy chair of the Royal Drawing School, a member of the Council of the British School at Rome, a member of the board of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions and a governor of the Building Crafts College. Grossman was chairman of the Churches Conservation Trust from 2007 to 2016 and in 2009 became chairman of the Heritage Alliance ‚Äì the UK organisation that represents more than 100 leading non-governmental organisations across the heritage sector. In 2015, he was elected for an unprecedented third term as chairman. In 2016, he was appointed chairman of The Royal Parks. =Current appointments= Grossman is chairman of The Royal Parks, having been reappointed for a four-year term in July 2020, to run from 5 July 2020 to 4 July 2024. He is also chairman of Gresham College, a governor of the British Institute at Florence, a governor of the Compton Verney House Trust and a trustee of the Warburg Charitable Trust. He is president of the Arts Society (formerly NADFAS) and patron of the Association for Heritage Interpretation. =Other activities= Grossman is a Liveryman of The Worshipful Company of Carpenters, an Honorary Liveryman of The Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Past Master of the Worshipful Company of Arts Scholars. He is a fellow of a number of learned societies: The Society of Antiquaries. The Royal Historical Society, The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and The Royal Society of Medicine.  Personal life  Grossman was married to Deborah Puttnam, the daughter of the film producer David Puttnam, from 1985 to 2004 and they have two daughters. Grossman is a keen scuba diver and a lifelong fan of the Boston Red Sox. His Mid-Atlantic accent reflects his Boston origins and has frequently been the subject of parody including in adverts for his own sauces.

Tippin is a fictional character, portrayed by Bradley Cooper. He is one of Sydney Bristow's friends on the ABC television series Alias. Character biography At the beginning of the series, Will was just Sydney Bristow's friend and a local reporter with a Los Angeles newspaper. Following the death of Sydney's fianc√©, Danny Hecht, Will began pursuing leads surrounding Danny's bizarre death. Sydney, knowing the truth (Danny was killed because SD-6 found out he knew Sydney was a spy) asked Will to cease his investigation to protect him from the same fate. However, after a short time, Will went on to investigate and soon found himself wrapped up in Sydney's world of espionage. After a certain time, Will had acquired enough facts to write an article about SD-6 and handed it to his editor to publish if he didn't contact her within the next 7 days. In that time, Tippin had planned to see the unknown voice in Paris in person, who had supported him in the last weeks with hints about SD-6 in general and Jack Bristow in particular. Having arrived there, he instead learns about the true identity of Sydney Bristow. Since he is now in danger because of his knowledge of SD-6, he is brought into a safehouse of the CIA in Los Angeles, only to be kidnapped out of that safehouse to Taipei by Julian Sark. Sydney, Jack and Vaughn had to get there to rescue him. In order to discredit Tippin's story--and at the same time, save him from being killed by SD-6--Jack arranged for him to appear as a drug addict in order to condemn his trustworthiness as a newspaper reporter.Allalias.com In the first half of the second season, Will was recruited as a private researcher for the CIA. Utilizing his tenacity and journalistic instinct, Tippin researched the secret government experiment Project Christmas for Michael Vaughn. That experiment was designed to use standardized tests given to school children to determine potential future CIA recruits. The Soviets became aware of the project and sent KGB operative Irina Derevko on an undercover mission to determine the specifics so they could enact their own version of the program. Will briefly dated Francie Calfo and shortly after, unbeknownst to him, Francie's genetic doppelganger Allison Doren. Will discovers the ruse by finding Provacillium in Sydney's medicine cabinet, medication taken by gene therapy patients. At exactly the same time, Allison looks through Will's work and finds out Will is researching an \\"Allison Georgia Doren.\\" Allison realizes Will is close to knowing the truth, and attempts to frame him for her crimes, drugging him and subjecting him to subliminal conditioning which would render him unable to recall his exact actions at certain times, but Sydney sees through this attempt. When Will realizes the truth about Alison, she nearly kills him, but he recovers and is quickly shuttled into the Federal Witness Protection Program, removing him as a regular character for season three. However, he did have a brief reappearance after he was sought out by Sydney, when a current mission required her to make contact with one of Will's old sources during his career as an analyst, and the two had a brief tryst. During this reunion mission, Will finally encounters Allison and kills her for the murder of Francie, after which he returns to private life. Near the end of the 5th season, in the episode \\"There's Only One Sydney Bristow\\" (also the series' 100th episode), Tippin is kidnapped by Anna Espinosa and used as bait for Sydney. During the rescue mission, a sample of her DNA is stolen. Later, it is discovered Will's captors (Prophet Five) have implanted a miniature bomb in his head, set to go off if Sydney doesn't deliver a Milo Rambaldi artifact to Anna aboard a train in Europe. Will accompanies Sydney on the mission, which is once again a trap to gather more genetic material from Sydney (ultimately used to transform Anna into a genetic duplicate of Sydney in the same way Francie was replaced by Allison). Will rescues Sydney and Sydney disarms the bomb with a remote control. During this mission, Will informs Sydney he was planning on proposing to his girlfriend before he was kidnapped and asks Sydney to be his best man, to which she agrees with enthusiasm. This is the last we hear of him.

Initially the best friend of lead character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), Francie is murdered by a lookalike assassin named Allison Doren, who assumes her identity. Character overview As the series begins in the 2001 pilot episode \\"Truth Be Told\\", Francie is Sydney Bristow's best friend and roommate. Sydney is a covert agent for a black ops division of the CIA called SD-6, a fact she struggles to hide from her friends. Francie acts as an occasional sounding board and confidante for some of Sydney's personal issues, and eventually decides to open a restaurant. Francie and her friend Will Tippin realize their attraction to each other, and decide to start a relationship. Sydney, having learned that SD-6 is not a sanctioned CIA division but is in fact a covert cell of a transnational organized crime syndicate, manages to destroy the entire organization in the Season 2 episode \\"Phase One\\" (2003). In the same episode, a genetic doppelg√§nger named Allison Doren kills Francie and assumes her identity. Under orders from Arvin Sloane, Allison bugs Sydney's apartment, hypnotically interrogates Will, plants eavesdropping devices on Michael Vaughn and murders Marcus Dixon's wife. Eventually Will, and then Sydney, realize in the 2003 episode \\"The Telling\\" that \\"Francie\\" is an impostor, and after a brutal battle Sydney shoots Allison to death. Allison later reappears very much alive in the 2003 episode \\"The Nemesis\\", in which she is shot by Sydney and then stabbed to death by Will. Francie herself appears in a brief flashback in the 2006 series finale \\"All the Time in the World\\", in which Sydney is shown to have met her first fianc√©, Danny Hecht, through Francie and her boyfriend. Development The character was named after Francie Calfo, the real-life vice president of drama development at Touchstone Television who shepherded Alias to series. With Francie not involved in the \\"secret agent\\" plot lines of the series, the character was \\"pushed to the sidelines\\" just as Lena Olin was introduced as Sydney's mother Irina Derevko late in Season 1. Clued in by Alias creator and executive producer J. J. Abrams in October 2002 to the \\"switch\\" of her character, Dungey and Abrams discussed different ways to facilitate it. Dungey began secretly training with world champion kickboxer Benny \\"the Jet\\" Urquidez to prepare for the physicality of her new role. She quipped, \\"Jennifer [Garner] is a badass ... And if I'm going to have to get in there and tangle with her or any one of her fellow foes on the show, I've got to be ready.\\" Francie is murdered and Allison is introduced in \\"Phase One\\", which aired after Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. Following the broadcast, Dungey noted that \\"Bad Francie\\" would continue playing the part of Sydney's friend for the purpose of espionage. She noted, \\"Even though some of the situations seem to be similar ‚Äî me and Sydney in the house talking ‚Äî you know Bad Francie is up to no good ... It's sooo good now. It is just delicious every time I get to jump into 'the Francinator.'\\" The events of \\"Phase One\\" initiated a \\"reboot\\" of sorts for the series, with the end of the SD-6 double agent storyline as well as Sydney's need to hide her profession from her friends (Will discovers the truth and Francie is now known to be dead). Allison-as-Francie was repeatedly referred to as \\"Bad Francie\\" or \\"Evil Francie\\" by fans and the press. Plotlines =Allison Doren= At the end of the second season, Will discovers Allison is not Francie. He attempts to warn Sydney by leaving a frantic voicemail message on her phone, when he is suddenly attacked by Allison, who attempts to strangle him. After failing to kill him, Will corners her with a knife and demands, \\"It's always been you? Allison?\\" Allison expresses remorse at what was happening, as she had apparently developed feelings for him during the months she spent posing as Francie. Allison knocks the knife away from Will, takes it, and stabs him with it. She hides Will's body in the bathtub shortly before Sydney arrives home. Once home, Sydney relaxes on the couch beside Allison, checking her voicemail. She receives Will's message and manages to retain her composure, casually offering Allison ice cream, which Allison accepts. Sydney then excuses herself, hastily making her way to her bedroom to get a weapon, somehow realizing Will was right and \\"Francie\\" was a double. Allison appears in the doorway and reveals her mistake, \\"I just remembered. Francie doesn't like coffee ice cream,\\" to which Sydney replies, \\"No, she doesn't.\\" The two engage in a desperate, brutal fight throughout the house during which most of the furniture and possessions are either utilized as weapons or destroyed. During the fight Sydney finds Will's body in the bathroom, although she later learns he survived Allison's attack. The fight ends when Sydney manages to shoot Allison three times, once in the arm and twice in the chest. Despite apparently dying, Allison is recovered by the Covenant and nursed back to health, turning up in the third season. Sydney confronts her in Sofia and shoots her. Allison heals rapidly and escapes from an ambulance transporting her to a hospital. Later, Will finds and confronts her, stabbing and killing her, in exactly the same manner as she had once stabbed him.

The Act Against Slavery was an anti- slavery law passed on July 9, 1793, in the second legislative session of Upper Canada, the colonial division of British North America that would eventually become Ontario. It banned the importation of slaves and mandated that children born henceforth to female slaves would be freed upon reaching the age of 25. Synopsis John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant Governor of the colony, had been a supporter of abolition before coming to Upper Canada; as a British Member of Parliament, he had described slavery as an offence against Christianity. By 1792 the slave population in Upper Canada was not large. However, when compared with the number of free settlers, the number was not insignificant. In York (the present-day city of Toronto) there were 15 African-Canadians living, while in Quebec some 1000 slaves could be found. Furthermore, by the time the Act Against Slavery would be ratified, the number of slaves residing in Upper Canada had been significantly increased by the arrival of Loyalists refugees from the south who brought with them servants and slaves. At the inaugural meeting of the Executive Council of Upper Canada in March 1793, Simcoe heard from a witness the story of Chloe Cooley, a female slave who had been violently removed from Canada for sale in the United States. Simcoe's desire to abolish slavery in Upper Canada was resisted by members of the Legislative Assembly who owned slaves, and therefore the resulting act was a compromise. The bulk of the text is due to John White, the Attorney General of the day. Of the 16 members of the assembly, at least six owned slaves. The law, titled An Act to Prevent the further Introduction of Slaves and to limit the Term of Contracts for Servitude within this Province, stated that while all slaves in the province would remain enslaved until death, no new slaves could be brought into Upper Canada, and children born to female slaves after passage of the act would be freed at the age of 25. This law made Upper Canada \\"the first British colony to abolish slavery\\". The Act remained in force until 1833 when the British Parliament's Slavery Abolition Act abolished slavery in most parts of the British Empire. Aftermath In 1798, Christopher Robinson introduced a bill in the Legislative Assembly to allow the importation of additional slaves. The bill was passed by the Assembly, but was stalled by the Legislative Council and died at the end of the session. Thousands of Black Canadians volunteered to serve in the War of 1812. In 1819, Attorney General John Robinson (son of Christopher) declared that by residing in Canada, black residents were set free, and that Canadian courts would protect their freedom.

Born in Halifax, he was mayor of Halifax from 1861 to 1864 before entering provincial politics as a supporter of Canadian confederation in 1867 serving as Provincial Secretary in the Conservative cabinet of Hiram Blanchard but lost his seat in the fall 1867 election that defeated the government. Hill returned to the legislature in 1870 by winning a by-election as a Liberal- Conservative. He again lost his seat in 1871 but returned in 1874 and served in the Liberal government of William Annand as provincial secretary. Feelings against confederation had abated and Hill was well placed to put forward a compromise position that enabled him to succeed Annand as premier in 1875. However, Hill took over the Liberal government at a time that the federal Liberals were in power under Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie and becoming increasingly unpopular in Nova Scotia. That, and the failure of the Annand and Hill governments to make progress on railway construction, led to the Liberal's defeat in the 1878 election after which Hill retired from politics. He moved to England in 1882 and published a series theological pamphlets. He died in Tunbridge Wells.

Street collaborated with Morrissey on his debut album Viva Hate following the split of The Smiths. More recently he has worked with Kaiser Chiefs, Babyshambles and The Courteeners. For a time, he was managed by Gail Colson's company Gailforce Management. In February 2020, it was announced Street will receive the Outstanding Achievement Award at the upcoming Music Producer's Guild Awards. Career =Early career= Street began his musical career in the late 1970s playing in various bands around London. He played bass in the new wave ska/pop group, Bim, with future Neneh Cherry/Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey. The band were featured in the Listen to London documentary film. Street started at Island Records' Fallout Shelter Studio in 1982 firstly as an \\"in-house assistant\\" and then as an \\"in- house engineer\\". =The Smiths and Morrissey (1984‚Äì1989)= One of Street's first jobs as in-house engineer was for a session for The Smiths's \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" and commented in a HitQuarters interview, \\"I'd seen them just shortly beforehand on Top of the Pops doing \\"This Charming Man\\", and like most other people around that time who were into music I was really excited by them.\\" Although Street didn't work on the subsequent recording \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\", he was asked to engineer their next album, Meat Is Murder, with Morrissey and Marr producing for the first time. During this time, he engineered for reggae artists including Black Uhuru and Linton Kwesi Johnson, and for j√πj√∫ musician King Sunny Ad√©. He helped produce and mix several tracks on Stephen Duffy's first two albums: The Ups and the Downs in 1985 and Because We Love You in 1986. Twelve years later, he worked with Duffy on his 1998 album I Love My Friends. Street continued to work with The Smiths, working as an engineer on their album The Queen Is Dead before assuming a producer role for Strangeways, Here We Come, their final album. After The Smiths broke up, Street was contacted by lead singer Morrissey, who offered him the position of producer and co-songwriter for his forthcoming album, which came to be titled Viva Hate. Street accepted and this album reached No. 1, spawning two top 10 hits in the UK. Street and Vini Reilly, guitarist on Viva Hate had a dispute over songwriting credits. Reilly claimed to have written the majority of the tracks on the album, which Street dismissed and claimed that he wrote all of the tracks on the album and that Reilly had no part to play in this. Street was credited as producer, songwriter, guitarist, and bass guitarist on the album. Street went on to co-write and produce two further singles for Morrissey which appeared on Bona Drag before the singer ended their association, apparently due to disputes regarding royalty payments and alleged conversations between Street and Johnny Rogan, author of controversial Morrissey texts. =Blur (1990‚Äì1997; 2015) and Graham Coxon (2003‚Äì2009)= After hearing \\"She's So High\\", Blur's first single, Street contacted their manager. Soon after he produced their second single \\"There's No Other Way\\", although he did not produce the album as a whole. Street produced Blur's next four albums: Modern Life Is Rubbish, Parklife, The Great Escape and Blur. Following Graham Coxon's departure from Blur, Street produced the guitarist's next album Happiness in Magazines, released May 2004, plus follow-up albums Love Travels at Illegal Speeds in March 2006 and The Spinning Top in May 2009. Street produced Blur's 2015 album The Magic Whip, their first since the band's reformation with Coxon. =The Cranberries (1992‚Äì1994; 2001‚Äì2002; 2011‚Äì2019)= In 1992, Street started working with Irish band The Cranberries on their debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?. The album turned out to be a huge success in the U.S. In 1994, Street worked with the band again on their second album No Need to Argue. Following two albums with different producers, the band worked with Street again on their 2001 album Wake Up and Smell the Coffee and the two extra tracks that were recorded for their 2002 best of album Stars: \\"Stars\\" and \\"New New York\\". After The Cranberries went on hiatus in 2003, guitarist Noel Hogan began working on a solo work then titled Mono Band. Street worked with Hogan in producing the album of the same name released in 2005. Street also produced their sixth studio album Roses, released in 2012. He also produced their final album In the End, released in 2019. =Kaiser Chiefs and The Ordinary Boys (2004‚Äì2007)= Street produced Employment, the debut album by Kaiser Chiefs, after hearing one of their early demos and contacted the band about producing them. At one point, Street brought Blur guitarist Graham Coxon into the studio to rev his moped for a sound effect. This can be heard on the track \\"Saturday Night\\". Street produced the band's second album Yours Truly, Angry Mob. Street also produced the first two albums for ska-influenced indie band The Ordinary Boys: Over the Counter Culture in 2004 and Brassbound in 2005. =Babyshambles (2007‚Äìpresent) and Peter Doherty (2008‚Äìpresent)= Street produced Shotter's Nation, the second album by Pete Doherty's band Babyshambles. The recording of the album was said to have been a hard process, due to Street's lack of co- operation with Pete Doherty. Street later commented that \\"Pete wasn't in a very good state for the first couple of weeks of making the record for the reasons that people know about. It was a bit worrying to be honest with you. There were a couple of times I had to fire warning shots across his bow, say 'Listen, you've got to sort yourself out here because if you don't I can't work with you'. I felt like I was going to let down the rest of the band if I walked away from things.\\" Street went on to produce the band's third album Sequel to the Prequel. Street produced Doherty's solo album Grace/Wastelands (2009). =Other work= In 1988, Street, along with journalist Jerry Smith, who set up the Foundation Label. The label was home to artists including Bradford and Sp!n. However, the label wasn't a commercial success and folded in 1991. In 1989, Street produced and engineered \\"The Black Swan\\" by The Triffids. Street produced the 1990 Danielle Dax album Blast the Human Flower, released on Sire Records, along with a subsequent remix EP. Street worked with The Darling Buds' on their third and fourth albums Crawdaddy (1990) and Erotica (1992). He produced The Caretaker Race's album Hangover Square in 1990. The band, formed by ex-Loft guitarist Andy Strickland and roving drummer Dave Mew, had recorded a number of singles previously, some produced by John Parrish. For Hangover Square, the band added a number of new tracks, including \\"Man Overboard\\" and \\"2 Steel Rings\\", both released as singles. Street worked with Lloyd Cole, produced Shed Seven's 1998 album Let It Ride and worked with New Order. He also produced several tracks on the Longpigs second album Mobile Home in 1999. In 2001‚Äì2002, Street worked from Jacobs Studios in Farnham, Surrey, England to produce Wood/Water, The Promise Ring's final album, released by ANTI- in 2002. Street also co-produced A New Morning by Suede, released in September 2002. Street produced The Magic Treehouse, the debut album from Ooberman, and Tired of Hanging Around, the second album by The Zutons, released in the UK in April 2006. Street produced the next album by Feeder, released in 2008. Street co-produced the tracks \\"Save Us\\" and \\"Burn the Bridges\\" from the band's The Singles album with lead singer Grant Nicholas. An exclusive mix of this track, done entirely by Street, was available from iTunes upon release. Street worked with alternative post-punk band White Lies when they were known as Fear of Flying, producing \\"Routemaster\\" and \\"Three's a Crowd\\". Street approached Manchester indie band The Courteeners after hearing demos and offered to produce the album. The album was recorded in London over a six-week stretch and was named St. Jude. The album reached No. 4 in the British UK Album Charts, but was subject to mixed reviews. In August 2010, Street produced the debut EP for Dublin-based band The Vagabonds.

He was a regent of the empire from 1861 to 1865 and wielded great influence at other times as well. At a young age, Yixin was already noted for his brilliance and was once considered by his father the Daoguang Emperor as a potential heir. However, his older half-brother Yizhu eventually inherited the throne as the Xianfeng Emperor. During the Second Opium War in 1860, Prince Gong negotiated with the British, French and Russians, signing the Convention of Beijing on behalf of the Qing Empire. Following the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, Prince Gong launched the Xinyou Coup in 1861 with the aid of the Empress Dowagers Ci'an and Cixi and seized power from a group of eight regents appointed by the Xianfeng Emperor on his deathbed to assist his young son and successor, the Tongzhi Emperor. After the coup, he served as Prince-Regent from 1861‚Äì65 and presided over the reforms implemented during the Tongzhi Restoration (1860‚Äì74). Despite his demotions in 1865 and 1874 for alleged corruption and disrespect towards the Emperor, Prince Gong continued to lead the Grand Council and remain a highly influential figure in the Qing government. The final decades of Prince Gong's career, under the reign of his nephew the Guangxu Emperor, were marred by his conflict with conservative elements in the Qing imperial court ‚Äì particularly his former ally Cixi ‚Äì and ended with his death in relative disgrace. Having established in 1861 the Zongli Yamen, the Qing government's de facto foreign affairs ministry, Prince Gong is best remembered for advocating greater constructive engagement between the Qing Empire and the great powers of that era, as well as for his attempts to modernise China in the late 19th century. His former residence, \\"Prince Gong's Mansion\\", is now one of Beijing's few AAAAA-rated tourist attractions. Names Yixin is the pinyin romanisation of the Mandarin pronunciation of his Manchu name I-hin. He shared his surname Aisin Gioro with the other members of the Qing imperial family. His courtesy or art name was \\"Master of the Yuedao Hall\\" or \\"Hall of the Way of Music\\". Kung is the Wade-Giles romanisation of Mandarin pronunciation of the same Chinese character , now spelt G≈çng in pinyin. It is not really a name but a part of a descriptive title ‚Äî \\"The Respectful Prince of the Blood\\" ‚Äî previously borne by Changning, the fifth son of the Shunzhi Emperor. The Chinese title translates literally as \\"king\\" but is usually understood as a \\"prince\\" in terms of the imperial Chinese nobility. Because Changning's rank had not been given \\"iron-cap\\" status, each generation of his descendants were reduced in rank unless they somehow proved themselves anew and earned a new title of their own. Yixin, however, was given \\"iron-cap\\" status and his direct heirs inherited his full title as well. In English, however, it is usually misunderstood as a name: PrinceKung in older sources and PrinceGong in newer ones. He was also sometimes known as the \\"Sixth Prince\\" or, less flatteringly, \\"Devil #6\\". He was posthumously known as \\"the Respectful and Loyal Prince of the Blood\\": Prince Kung-chung or Gongzhong. Life =Early life= Yixin was born in the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, as the sixth son of the Daoguang Emperor.(ÊÅ≠Âø†Ë¶™ÁéãÂ•ïË®¢ÔºåÂÆ£ÂÆóÁ¨¨ÂÖ≠Â≠ê„ÄÇ) Qing Shi Gao vol. 221.

The Anglo-French delegation, which included Harry Smith Parkes and Henry Loch, were taken prisoner by the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen during the negotiations. Sengge Rinchen then led his elite Mongol cavalry to attack the Anglo-French forces at the Battle of Baliqiao but was defeated.

Yixin's flexible attitude towards dealing with the Western powers had put him at odds with the eight regents, who were politically conservative and opposed to Western influence. Upon request, Prince Gong was granted permission to travel to Chengde to attend the funeral. In Chengde, he met the Empress Dowagers Ci'an and Cixi and told them about how the eight regents monopolised state power. When the Xianfeng Emperor's coffin arrived back in Beijing in November 1861, Prince Gong and the two empress dowagers launched a coup ‚Äì historically known as the Xinyou Coup (ËæõÈÖâÊîøËÆä) ‚Äì to oust the eight regents from power.

Although the empress dowagers did not restore Prince Gong as Prince-Regent, they permitted him to remain in the inner imperial court and continue running the Zongli Yamen.

In 1869, An Dehai, a court eunuch and close aide of Empress Dowager Cixi, was arrested and executed in Shandong Province by Ding Baozhen, the provincial governor. This was because it was a capital crime for eunuchs to travel out of the Forbidden City without authorisation. The empress dowager became more suspicious of Prince Gong because she believed that he instigated Ding Baozhen to execute An Dehai. Demotion and restoration In October 1872, when the Tongzhi Emperor married the Jiashun Empress, he granted Prince Gong the \\"iron-cap\\" privilege again. He officially took over the reins of power from his regents in around February 1873.(ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥‰πùÊúàÔºåÁ©ÜÂÆóÂ§ßÂ©öÔºåÂæ©ÂëΩÁéãÁàµ‰∏ñË•≤„ÄÇÂçÅ‰∫åÂπ¥Ê≠£ÊúàÔºåÁ©ÜÂÆóË¶™ÊîøÔºå ...) Qing Shi Gao vol. 221. In the same year, Prince Gong displeased Empress Dowager Cixi when he strongly opposed her plan to rebuild the Old Summer Palace. In August 1874, Prince Gong was reprimanded and punished again for failing to observe court protocol. This time, he was demoted from a qinwang (first-rank prince) to a junwang (second-rank prince). Zaicheng, Prince Gong's eldest son, also lost his beile title. Despite his demotion, Prince Gong was still allowed to remain in the Grand Council. The following day, the empress dowagers ordered Prince Gong and Zaicheng to be restored as a qinwang and beile respectively. Towards the end of the year, the Tongzhi Emperor increased Prince Gong's salary by more than twice that of a normal qinwang, but died not long later in around December.(....

Prince Gong was also appointed as zongling (ÂÆó‰ª§; Head of the Imperial Clan Court). Sino-French War In 1884, when the French invaded Vietnam, Prince Gong and the members of the Grand Council were unable to arrive at a decision on whether or not to intervene in Vietnam and go to war with the French. As a consequence, Empress Dowager Cixi reprimanded Prince Gong and his colleagues for their dispirited and indecisive attitude towards the war, and removed them from their positions. Prince Gong stopped receiving his double salary and was ordered to retire to recuperate from illness. However, he started receiving his double salary again from November 1886 and was allowed to receive his share of the offerings from ceremonial events.(Âæ∑ÂÆóÂç≥‰ΩçÔºåÂæ©ÂëΩÂÖçÂè¨Â∞çÂè©Êãú„ÄÅÂ•è‰∫ãÊõ∏Âêç„ÄÇÂÖâÁ∑íÂÖÉÂπ¥ÔºåÁΩ≤ÂÆó‰ª§„ÄÇÂçÅÂπ¥ÔºåÊ≥ïËò≠Ë•ø‰æµË∂äÂçóÔºåÁéãËàáËªçÊ©üÂ§ßËá£‰∏çÊ¨≤ËºïË®ÄÊà∞ÔºåË®ÄË∑Ø‰∫§Á´†Ë´ñÂäæ„ÄÇÂ§™ÂêéË´≠Ë≤¨ÁéãÁ≠âÂßîÈù°Âõ†Âæ™ÔºåÁΩ∑ËªçÊ©üÂ§ßËá£ÔºåÂÅúÈõô‰ø∏„ÄÇÂÆ∂Â±ÖÈ§äÁñæ„ÄÇÂçÅ‰∫åÂπ¥ÂçÅÊúàÔºåÂæ©Èõô‰ø∏„ÄÇËá™ÊòØÂúãÂèäÁî≤Êï∏ÔºåÊ≠≤ÊôÇÁ•Ä‰∫ãË≥úÁ•ûÁ≥ïÔºåÁØÄÂ∫èËºíÊúâË≥ûË≥öÔºå‰ª•ÁÇ∫Â∏∏„ÄÇ) Qing Shi Gao vol. 221. He remained in Jietai Temple in western Beijing for most of the time. Prince Gong's seventh brother, Yixuan (Prince Chun), replaced him as the head of the Grand Council. Some officials such as Baojun (ÂØ∂ÈãÜ), Li Hongzao, Jinglian (ÊôØÂªâ) and Weng Tonghe, who previously served in Prince Gong's administration, were also dismissed from office. The incident is known as the \\"Cabinet Change of Jiashen\\" (Áî≤Áî≥ÊòìÊ®û) or \\"Political Change of Jiashen\\" (Áî≤Áî≥ÊúùÂ±Ä‰πãËÆä) because it took place in the jiashen year according to the Chinese sexagenary cycle. First Sino-Japanese War In 1894, when the Japanese invaded Korea and the situation became dire, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned Prince Gong back to the imperial court, placed him in charge of the Zongli Yamen again, and tasked him with supervising the Beiyang Fleet (the Qing navy) and military affairs. Although Prince Gong had been recalled to politics, Empress Dowager Cixi also decreed that since he had not yet recovered from illness, he was exempted from having to constantly attend court sessions.(‰∫åÂçÅÂπ¥ÔºåÊó•Êú¨‰æµÊúùÈÆÆÔºåÂÖµÔºüÊúâÊÖ∂Â±¢Â¢ûË≠∑‰∫ãÊÄ•ÔºåÂ§™ÂêéÂè¨ÁéãÂÖ•Ë¶ãÔºåÂæ©Ëµ∑ÁéãÁÆ°ÁêÜÁ∏ΩÁêÜÂêÑÂúã‰∫ãÂãôË°ôÈñÄÔºå‰∏¶Á∏ΩÁêÜÊµ∑ËªçÔºåÊúÉÂêåËæ¶ÁêÜËªçÂãôÔºåÂÖßÂª∑Ë°åËµ∞Ôºõ‰ªçË´≠ÁéãÁñæÊú™ÁôíÔºåÂÖçÂ∏∏Â∑ùÂÖ•Áõ¥„ÄÇÂ∞ãÂèàÂëΩÁéãÁù£Ëæ¶ËªçÂãôÔºåÁØÄÂà∂ÂêÑË∑ØÁµ±ÂÖµÂ§ßËá£„ÄÇÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊúàÔºåÊéàËªçÊ©üÂ§ßËá£„ÄÇ) Qing Shi Gao vol. 221. =Death= In 1898, Prince Gong was appointed as zongling again, but he became critically ill by the end of April.

(born 6 August 1948) is a retired Free Presbyterian minister from Northern Ireland. A former Democratic Unionist Party politician, he represented South Antrim and Mid Ulster as their Member of Parliament (MP) . Early life and education McCrea was the youngest of five children born to Robert Thomas (a farmer in Stewartstown, Northern Ireland) and Sarah Jayne in August 1948. He was educated in Magherafelt and spent a short time working in Social Security in the Civil Service of Northern Ireland before beginning training as a Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster minister. He undertook this training at Ravenhill Theological Hall, on the Ravenhill Road in Belfast. McCrea received an Honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Mariette Bible College, Ohio, United States. (This institution is not certified by the Department of Higher Education or the State of Ohio.) Career McCrea was a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) member of Magherafelt District Council from its creation in 1973 until he stood down to concentrate on Westminster duties in 2010, and topped the poll in every local government election he contested from 1973‚Äì2005. He ran unsuccessfully for the House of Commons in the 1982 Belfast South by- election. He was Member of Parliament for Mid Ulster from 1983 but lost this seat to Sinn F√©in chief negotiator and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness at the 1997 election. He took South Antrim at a by-election in 2000 caused by the death of Ulster Unionist Party MP, Clifford Forsythe, but failed to retain this seat at the 2001 election. In the 2005 election he regained the seat. He was subsequently defeated by the Ulster Unionist Party in 2015. In 1996 he was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum for Mid-Ulster. From 1998 to 2007 he was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for Mid Ulster. He was therefore a political representative for two separate constituencies (Mid Ulster and South Antrim) from 2000 to 2001 and from 2005 to 2007. At the 2007 election, he was elected as an Assembly Member for South Antrim. He resigned from the Assembly in 2010, following his return to Westminster at the general election of that year.Girvan makes Stormont return, Newtownabbey Times, 8 July 2010 He is also the minister of Magherafelt Free Presbyterian Church and has made numerous gospel albums. McCrea was created a life peer on 19 June 2018 taking the title Baron McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown, of Magherafelt in the County of Londonderry and of Cookstown in the County of Tyrone. Controversy and paramilitary associations McCrea was a member of the Shankill Defence Association and in 1971 he was convicted of riotous behaviour in Dungiven. In 1975 he led a prayer service at the paramilitary funerals of Wesley Somerville and Harris Boyle. The two terrorists were part of the Glenanne gang which carried out the Miami Showband killings and were accidentally blown up when the bomb they were planting in the band's minibus went off prematurely, killing them instantly. McCrea was the target of a parcel bomb to his home on 9 August 1988, when a package sent by the Irish People's Liberation Organisation was disarmed. McCrea had become suspicious when he noticed the package had a Dublin postmark.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald, INLA ‚Äì Deadly Divisions, 1994, p. 310 McCrea was criticised when he appeared on a platform at a Portadown rally in support of the senior Ulster loyalist paramilitary Billy Wright, who had been threatened by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leadership, in September 1996. Wright was the founder and leader of the Loyalist Volunteer Force (which had broken away from the UVF), and had been threatened after he broke the UVF ceasefire by ordering the death of Catholic civilian Michael McGoldrick. In 2000, McCrea was the subject of an early day motion by two MPs, Harry Barnes and Sir Peter Bottomley. The motion referenced a claim that McCrea had visited Wright's successor as LVF leader in order to persuade the LVF not to decommission any of its weapons. =Call for British airstrikes against Irish towns= A Northern Ireland Office memo released under the thirty-year rule in December 2014 revealed that McCrea had called for the Royal Air Force to carry out \\"strikes against Dundalk, Drogheda, Crossmaglen and Carrickmore\\" at the DUP's annual conference in April 1986. =Alternative medicine= McCrea is a supporter of homeopathy, having signed several early day motions in support of its continued funding on the National Health Service, sponsored by Conservative MP David Tredinnick.

The series follows Sydney Bristow, an operative working for an organization called SD-6 which she believes is a covert branch of the Central Intelligence Agency. However, she learns it is actually a subsidiary of the Alliance of Twelve, a crime syndicate which seeks to make profits from stolen intelligence and artifacts. Upon learning the truth Sydney offers her services to the CIA as a double agent with the intention of destroying SD-6 from within. Julian Sark is introduced in the first season's fourteenth episode, \\"The Coup\\", where he is seen meeting the head of K-Directorate in Moscow on behalf of the person known only as \\"The Man\\" who intends to purchase Rambaldi's journal. The character appears in 46 more instances, with Anders credited in the title sequence nine times during the course of the show. The last one is the series finale, \\"All The Time In The World\\", in which Marcus Dixon asks Sydney to intercept Sark as he attempts to sell a stolen hard disk containing classified information. It is unknown whether the mission was carried out or if the disk was sold. Character biography Little is known about Sark's background. He spent most of his youth in the United Kingdom, although a voice analysis reveals he spent a lot of time in Galway, Ireland. He is the heir to a vast fortune from his Romanov- descended father, Andrian Lazarey. He routinely changes his alliances, and his true allegiance seems to be only to himself. He is notorious for his self- described \\"flexible loyalties\\" and his ability to evade and escape capture. Sark is a connoisseur of fine champagne. =Season 1= Sark is seen initially operating as an agent of a criminal organization headed by a mysterious figure known only as \\"The Man\\" (believed at first to be Alexander Khasinau but later revealed to be Irina Derevko). He leads a strike team against FTL Headquarters, personally killing FTL head Quan Li in broad daylight literally outside FTL's front door. The attack, coinciding precisely with McKenas Cole's unsuccessful assault on SD-6, was designed to retrieve an unknown Rambaldi artifact (as Cole's was designed to obtain an ampule of unknown liquid). FTL's operatives list is compromised and within hours, FTL ceases to exist. Arvin Sloane states that this previously unknown organization now has the most significant collection of Rambaldi artifacts in the world. SD-6 learns of a meeting scheduled between the organization and K-Directorate to discuss the sharing of Rambaldi technology. Sydney and Dixon are tasked to eavesdrop on the meeting. Sark offers to transfer $100 million to K-Directorate's Cayman Islands account. In exchange, he demands the Rambaldi manuscript (which includes Page 47). The offer is rejected, and Sark instantly assassinates Ilyich Ivankov, leader of K-Directorate. The suddenly promoted new leader of K-Directorate, Lavro Kessar, accepts the offer. Sydney, who is dangling outside the window spying on the meeting, is spotted, a firefight ensues and Sark slips away. He is next seen in Tunisia trying to retrieve the Rambaldi manuscript, but Sydney gets to it first. Sark travels to Denpasar to buy a second ampule of Rambaldi liquid so he can expose a Rambaldi document (possibly the artifact retrieved from FTL). Unknown to him, the buy is a sting set up by Sydney and Michael Vaughn. The buy is disrupted by Dixon and other SD-6 agents. Sark flees with the ampule but Vaughn captures him and recovers it. When Vaughn abandons Sark to rescue Sydney, SD-6 recovers him. While in SD-6 custody Sark agrees to lead SD-6 to Khasinau in his Paris nightclub to recover the Rambaldi document. Sydney and Dixon are tasked to retrieve the document and replace it with a forgery. Sydney is further tasked by Vaughn to switch out the document with a counterfeit, but is unable to because she spots Will Tippin, who's been brought to Paris to meet a mysterious contact to discuss \\"The Circumference,\\" in the club. Dixon recovers the document and Sydney extracts Will and, with Jack's aid, returns him to Los Angeles. Sark escapes from the club, but Sloane had previously laced Sark's wine with a radioactive isotope and is tracking his location by satellite. However, Sark becomes aware of this and undergoes a full blood transfusion in Geneva. While SD-6 is on a wild goose chase to Switzerland, Sark actually returns to Los Angeles and kidnaps Will Tippin from a CIA safehouse. To secure Tippin's release, Jack steals the ampule from the CIA and Sydney steals the document from SD-6. Jack and Sydney expose the page and realize that it's The Circumference, instructions on how to use the Mueller device. Jack travels to Taipei and makes the exchange, and Sark vanishes into the night. =Season 2= Sark initially assumes control of Irina's assets but later allies with SD-6, but secretly collaborates with Sloane to provide Sydney with the location of \\"Server 47,\\" on which is housed enough intelligence to bring about the destruction of The Alliance of Twelve and all SD cells. However, no Rambaldi artifacts are found in any of the SD sites. Following the fall of SD-6, Sark continues to work with Sloane. He kidnaps the wife and son of mathematician Dr. Neil Caplan to coerce Caplan into assembling Rambaldi artifacts into a neutron bomb as well as coordinating the murder and replacement of Sydney's friend Francie Calfo by Allison Doren, who has been transformed by Project Helix into Francie's genetic duplicate. At the end of the season, Sark is taken into CIA custody. =Season 3= Sark becomes the chief financier of The Covenant. The Covenant, during the two-year time when Sydney was undercover as Julia Thorne, sent Sydney to assassinate Andrian Lazarey. Lazarey is Sark's father, and his apparent death causes $800 million in gold bullion to pass to Sark. These funds are seized by the Covenant in exchange for his release from CIA custody and Sark, despite having provided much of the organization's operating capital, feels he is relegated to the status of \\"foot soldier.\\" Sark carries out missions for the Covenant, sometimes with the aid of Lauren Reed, a double agent positioned within the NSC and married to Vaughn. One mission he undertakes with Allison Doren. With the apparent destruction of Project Helix, Doren is trapped in Francie's form but Sark, who claims to love her, says it doesn't matter. Doren is killed by Tippin in the course of that mission. Sark and Reed become lovers and eventually conspire to assassinate the leaders of the six Covenant cells in an attempt to take control of the organization. They manage the assassinations and are congratulated by McKenas Cole, who has become second-in-command of The Covenant. It is at this point that Sark's first name is revealed to be Julian. McKenas Cole appoints Sark and Lauren co-leaders of the North American cell. They ally once again with Arvin Sloane to obtain the Rambaldi equation that Nadia Santos, \\"The Passenger,\\" channels but are unsuccessful. Reed carries out a mission disguised as Sydney to obtain the equation from the CIA and bomb the CIA headquarters while Sark monitors her. She escapes but he is captured. =Season 4= During his second CIA-imposed imprisonment, Sark is released into the custody of Sydney and Vaughn to help track down terrorist Anna Espinosa. He agrees to help but demands to see proof that Lauren (whom, Allison notwithstanding, Sark also claims is \\"the woman [he] loved\\") is in fact dead. After seeing her body in a secret CIA crypt, Sark realizes that it was Vaughn who killed her. During the mission, Espinosa helps Sark escape, and the two briefly collaborate in the selling of a chemical bomb before Sark abandons Anna to Sydney's tender mercies and disappears for the remainder of the season. =Season 5= The episode Bob marks Sark's return to the series. With the death of Covenant leader Elena Derevko and the resulting apparent fall of The Covenant, Sark has gone freelance; on this occasion he is working on behalf of a Sudanese warlord to obtain a weapon of mass destruction. New APO recruit Rachel Gibson and he have a tryst while waiting for a transmission that neither knows the other intends to intercept. After Gibson discovers his identity and reports this to APO, Sark is hired by the agency to help recover the weapon, though he ultimately refuses payment after Gibson saves his life. In the episode I See Dead People Sloane sends Sark a secret message, presumably to secure his services to work with Anna Espinosa (in reality, Sydney impersonating Anna, who has been doubled into Sydney and subsequently killed by her). Sark engineers for them to be taken into custody in an Italian prison to secure a Rambaldi amulet from an elderly man known only as \\"The Rose.\\" Sark later teams with Sloane and Kelly Peyton to obtain The Horizon, the final Rambaldi artifact Sloane needs to complete his endgame, from Irina in exchange for two missiles. After planting a bomb to destroy APO headquarters (killing Thomas Grace), Sark accompanies Sloane to Mongolia to excavate the tomb of Milo Rambaldi and becomes involved in a stand-off involving Vaughn, Jack Bristow and other of Sloane's operatives. In a gun battle in Rambaldi's tomb, Sark retrieves the Horizon and returns it to Irina in Hong Kong. On Irina's orders, Sark prepares to launch the missiles at Washington, D.C. and London but is captured and shot by Vaughn. He gives Vaughn the codes to abort the launch and Vaughn apparently allows the wounded Sark to depart. Several years later, Marcus Dixon approaches a semi-retired Sydney and Vaughn and asks for their help with a field assignment. It's revealed that Sark has continued his unbroken track record of survival and is behind the incident Dixon is seeking help with. Sydney jokingly chides Vaughn for allowing Sark to get away years earlier.

He was the eldest son of Hong Taiji, the second ruler of the Qing dynasty. Life Hooge was born in the Aisin Gioro clan as the eldest son of Hong Taiji, the second ruler of the Qing dynasty. His mother was Lady Ula Nara, one of Hong Taiji's consorts. Hooge participated in military campaigns against the Mongols, Koreans and the Ming dynasty. After Hong Taiji's death in 1643, Hooge and his uncle Dorgon fought over the succession to the throne. The situation was to Hooge's advantage because three of the Eight Banners previously under Hong Taiji's control had been passed on to him. On the other hand, Dorgon had the support of his brothers and two White Banners. This meant that the remaining two Red Banners controlled by Dai≈°an and his son, as well as the Bordered Blue Banner under Chiurhala, were crucial to ensuring that Hooge could win the succession. After much dispute, Dai≈°an started favouring Hooge, who ostensibly refused to take the throne. Hooge was actually waiting for others to urge him to take the throne, so that he could sit on it without projecting a power-hungry image of himself. Unfortunately for Hooge, Dorgon and his brothers gave way, so the conflict continued without a solution. The power struggle concluded with a compromise in order to avoid internal strife. Dorgon nominated Fulin, another son of Hong Taiji born to Consort Zhuang, to be the new ruler, so Fulin ascended to the throne as the Shunzhi Emperor. Even after the Shunzhi Emperor came to power, there was still much friction between Hooge and Dorgon. According to popular belief, Hooge had conceived a scheme to seize the throne from the Shunzhi Emperor, but he leaked out his plan to Dorgon's brother Dodo, who informed Dorgon about it. Dorgon then used this as an excuse to have Hooge arrested and thrown into prison. However historical records state that Hooge was imprisoned after the Qing government launched military campaigns against remnant rebel forces in western China, and he died during his incarceration. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1650, two years after his death.

History Ferguslie Thread Mills In 1755 James and Patrick Clark began a loom equipment and silk thread business in Paisley, Scotland. In 1806 Patrick Clark invented a way of twisting cotton together to substitute for silk that was unavailable due to the French blockade of Great Britain. He opened the first plant for manufacturing the cotton thread in 1812. In 1864 the Clark family began manufacturing in Newark, New Jersey, U.S., as the Clark Thread Co.

The square is located at the southeast corner of the intersection of East Randolph Street and North Michigan Avenue. It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full-sized replica of the semicircle of paired Roman Doric-style columns (called a peristyle) that originally sat in this area of Grant Park, near Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street, between 1917 and 1953. The square also contains a large lawn and a public fountain. Detail Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west, Grant Park has been Chicago's front yard since the mid 19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Today, Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction. The square is a tree-lined section of Millennium Park with a large lawn. The area broadcasts free Wi-Fi wireless technology. The square has earned a reputation as an outdoor culture spot by hosting a wide range of cultural events such as local and international art and photography exhibitions, as well as occasional live musical performances. cited at This reputation is reminiscent of the earlier neo-classical meeting place. When Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley dedicated the square, it was dedicated to the donors, known as the Founders Group, who funded Millennium Park. In 2005, Millennium Park was marked for updates and improvements. Benches were to be added to the 56 original benches. Landscape architect Kathryn Gustafson designed 14 new , aluminum \\"Maggie benches\\" in Millennium Park, mostly in Wrigley square, in honor of Mayor Daley's wife. The square was intended to serve as an exhibit space for outdoor sculpture as well as small cultural performances, according to Christopher Perille, vice president of the Wrigley Square Foundation. The square's peristyle monument is in remembrance of the corporation, foundations, and individuals who made Millennium Park possible. 1926 view of original An architectural model of Wrigley Square and Millennium Monument, designed by O'Donnell, Wicklund, Pigozzi and Peterson Architects, Inc. (OWP&P;) in 2000, is on display at the Harold Washington Library Center. =Original peristyle= In 1917, the original peristyle was designed by renowned Chicago planner Edward H. Bennett, who was Daniel Burnham's partner in the Plan of Chicago and who was known for designing the nearby Buckingham Fountain. It was located in Grant Park in the same location as the current Wrigley Square. The original peristyle rose to and had a diameter of . The original was made of concrete, which did not stand up to the Lake Michigan lakefront weather. In 1953 it was razed to make way for the Grant Park North Garage. The original peristyle was on a promenade with balustrades. =Millennium Monument= A gift from the William Wrigley, Jr. Company, the limestone replica peristyle rises to a height of nearly (one source says the columns were planned to rise to ), restoring a classical elegance to Grant Park. The William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation contributed $5 million to the monument, and the entire square, which cost $5 million to build, was named in its honor. The Millennium Monument is a tribute to the individual, corporate and foundation benefactors of Millennium Park.Millennium Monument Plaque, William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation, dedicated October 30, 2002 The pedestal of the peristyle is inscribed with the names of the 115 financial donors (including Oprah Winfrey) who made the 91 contributions of at least $1 million each to help pay for Millennium Park. The New York Times describes the pedestal as French marble, but other sources mention the use of French limestone. These 115 donors are referred to as the founders of Millennium Park in official park brochures published by the City of Chicago and distributed at the visitor's centers as well as in other press accounts.\\"Millennium Park\\", a brochure by the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, February 2007 Their contributions not only paid for the construction of the park, but also provide for its ongoing conservation. The David Dillon and Michael Patrick Sullivan (of OWP&P;) design is based on original drawings by Bennett found in the Chicago Park District's archive. The naming rights of the space belong to Wm. Wrigley Jr, the foundation that created the world's famous chewing gum. Wrigley Company officials, including William Wrigley, Jr. II, wanted to contribute to Millennium Park, and the historic aspect of the peristyle was attractive to them partly because the original peristyle was constructed around the same time as the Wrigley Building, the corporate headquarters located a few blocks to the north, and because the classical architectural styles of both are similar. Viewed with Smurfit Stone Building The 24 paired, fluted columns are the same height as the original peristyle. However, the structure was scaled down to an diameter in order to accommodate the accessible ramp that runs behind the monument. Each of the limestone columns is cut from an Indiana quarry and made of five sections reinforced by steel rods and plates. The fountain in front of the monument is a bronze-cast replica of the finials that adorn the Wrigley Building. The brass spout was made from a mold of a terra cotta finail on the Wrigley Building. The front of the monument has a dedication plaque (pictured left). In addition, on the reverse side in approximately the same location, the monument has a special plaque commemorating John H. Bryan's contribution as the head of fundraising for the Park. The original model of the Millennium Monument was the starting point of the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to not compare to the once \\"commanding presence\\" that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a \\"classical\\" take on the original, incorporating a fountain at the base of the limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains open with a circular ledge to allow park-goers the freedom to sit next to the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.

Irina, played by Lena Olin, is the mother of the central character, Sydney Bristow. Biography She is first mentioned as Laura Bristow, the wife of Jack Bristow and mother of Sydney Bristow, who died in a car accident when Sydney was six years old. Sydney had always believed that her mother had died, and that she had been a professor of English Literature. Laura Bristow was, however, a spy for the Soviet Union. Her real name was Irina Derevko and she was recruited into the KGB at the age of 18 by Alexander Khasinau. She was assigned to infiltrate the United States, and to gain the trust of Jack Bristow, then a CIA agent, in order to steal classified information regarding Project Christmas. Under the alias of Laura, she approached Jack Bristow posing as an exchange student from the USSR. They eventually married and she became his confidante. In order to seal Jack's allegiance to her, the KGB demanded that she bear him a child. She gave him Sydney. In late 1981, Derevko disappeared after faking her own death. She returned to Russia, where she spent time in a KGB facility as a suspected traitor. Her whereabouts, however, were mostly unknown by the intelligence community at large until the end of season one. Jack tried to prevent Sydney from discovering the truth about her mother. He was forced to reveal the truth to Sydney when she mistakenly thought that he had been a KGB mole. At the end of the first season, Sydney discovered that her mother was alive and also the mysterious criminal overlord known up to that point only as \\"The Man\\". Derevko turned herself in to the CIA early in season two. She provided information to help bring down the SD-6, and assisted with other important missions. Jack, predicting that Irina would betray them, framed her for providing false information about a mission in Madagascar. The CIA planned to execute her. Agent Michael Vaughn learned the truth and helped Sydney stop her mother's execution. Later, during a mission in Panama, Irina did betray the CIA and joined forces with Arvin Sloane and Sark. Her subsequent whereabouts were unknown throughout season three, although she continued to be in occasional contact with Jack via Internet Relay Chat. She arranged for her sister, Katya Derevko, to assist Jack and Sydney on occasion. It was also learned that Irina had had an affair with Arvin Sloane and had a second daughter, Nadia Santos. At the beginning of season four, Sydney learned that Irina had hired a hit man to kill her. Jack Bristow received permission from his superiors to execute Irina, and in \\"Another Mr. Sloane\\" he states that he carried out the act himself. Sydney, unaware that Irina had ordered her death, later identified Irina's body in a Moscow medical facility and arranged for her burial in a Moscow crypt. In the fourth season episode \\"Ice\\", Nadia discovers a photograph of Irina holding a baby. Jack tells her that Irina told him that she had a niece. This niece preceded Sydney and was supposedly why Irina wanted a baby of her own. When Sydney was born Irina held her as she had the baby in the photo. No further information regarding the actual identity of the infant was ever presented and neither of the other Derevko sisters ever mentioned having a baby. Elena specifically said (in \\"Before The Flood\\") that she never wanted children. Jack presumes that the photo was just another ruse by Irina to mislead him. The shooting of Irina occurred 18 months prior to the season four finale and sometime prior to season three's finale, \\"Resurrection\\". The fourth season finale revealed that a genetic modification procedure known as Project Helix was used to create a double of Irina, and it is this woman whom Jack shot dead. The attempt on Sydney's life was placed by Irina's other sister, Elena Derevko, to mislead Jack into thinking he had killed his wife. The woman who underwent the genetic therapy was an agent of The Covenant, Elena's own criminal organization, who had volunteered to take Irina's place and be assassinated. The real Irina was imprisoned by Elena and tortured for her knowledge of Rambaldi's secrets. After 18 months, she was rescued by her daughters (she had not seen Nadia since her birth) and Jack. Although technically under arrest by the CIA, Irina was given permission to help stop Elena from completing her plans. After the successful completion of the mission, Jack and Sydney allowed her to escape rather than return to America and imprisonment. During the fifth season, it is revealed that Irina is involved to an unknown extent in the Prophet Five organization. Irina is seen observing Sydney's interrogation under hypnosis at the end of the episode \\"The Horizon\\". It is revealed she had Kelly Peyton kidnap Sydney to recover information about the Horizon, a Rambaldi artifact that would grant its wielder immortality. After Sydney appears to reveal the code crucial to her abductors' attempts to find the Horizon, Irina tells Peyton to make Sydney comfortable and leaves the observation room. In the episode \\"Maternal Instinct\\" she reunites briefly with Sydney and Jack, during which they discover her affiliation with Prophet Five and Irina also indicates that she gave the order to kill Michael Vaughn. She also tells Sydney that she never wanted to have children, and that she only did so on orders from the KGB. After helping Sydney deliver her baby (during an attack by Kelly Peyton), Irina disappears again. Irina finally met her demise in Hong Kong in the series finale. She retrieves the Horizon, which she had traded to Sloane for a pair of missiles, through Kelly Peyton. She ordered Sark to launch the missiles at Washington, D.C. and London. Jack assumed that Sloane wanted to use the missiles not to simply destroy areas with high population densities, but to profit from the reconstruction. Sydney tracked her down and learned that Irina sought the same immortality that Sloane had apparently found. Sydney and Irina battled a final time, precariously balanced on a skylight. Choosing to grab the Horizon rather than her daughter's hand, Irina fell through the skylight to her death. Portrayal Besides Lena Olin, several other actresses portrayed Irina in the course of the series: *Arabella Holzbog portrayed Irina/Laura Bristow in a photograph Sydney kept *Kate Anthony was the voice of Irina Derevko in the video clip shown in episode 1.19, \\"Snowman\\" *Natasha Pavlovich is the woman actually seen as Irina Derevko in that video clip *April Webster played Irina when she walks up to Sydney at the end of episode 1.22, \\"Almost Thirty Years\\" *M√≠a Maestro portrayed Irina/Laura in a photograph seen in episode 4.4, \\"Ice\\" Sisters =Katya Derevko= Yekatarina \\"Katya\\" Derevko, played by Isabella Rossellini, was the first of Irina's sisters to be announced. She first appeared in the third season to assist Jack and Sydney, but later revealed herself to be allied with The Covenant and was taken into federal custody. In season four she again helped Sydney and Jack to defeat Elena's endgame in exchange for a promise from Jack to work for a pardon and release for her. =Elena Derevko= Considered the most ruthless of the three Derevko sisters, Elena Derevko, portrayed by S√¥nia Braga, is first mentioned by Jack Bristow when he meets with Katya during the third season. She is a pivotal part of the fourth season, with her actions significantly affecting the lives of her nieces Sydney and Nadia.

Compton had a reputation for versatility, and in 1931 she appeared successively in the title role of the pantomime Dick Whittington and Ophelia to Henry Ainley's Hamlet. Throughout the 1930 Compton moved between West End plays, mostly ephemeral, pantomime and Shakespeare ‚Äì Titania, Lady Rosaline, Calpurnia, and Paulina in The Winter's Tale, one of her favourite parts ‚Äì and toured in Australia and New Zealand in Victoria Regina, Tonight at 8.30 and George and Margaret. In 1930 she played Ophelia to the Hamlet of John Gielgud, first at the Lyceum and then at Elsinore Castle. =1940s to 1960s= During the 1940s Compton appeared at the Old Vic as Regan in King Lear, played Ruth in No√´l Coward's Blithe Spirit for 15 months, Regina in The Little Foxes, toured for the British Council, in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland, in Othello, Candida and Hamlet, and made her first appearance in an Ibsen play as Gina Ekdal in The Wild Duck. Her third marriage was dissolved in 1942, and in that year she married the actor Ralph Michael; this marriage was dissolved in 1946. There were no children of Compton's last three marriages. In the 1950s Compton rejoined the Old Vic company, appearing at the 1953 Edinburgh Festival, as Gertrude in Hamlet', and in London in the 1953‚Äì1954 season, as Gertrude; the Countess of Rossillion in All's Well That Ends Well; Constance of Bretagne in King John; Volumnia in Coriolanus; and Juno in The Tempest. With the same company she played Queen Margaret in Richard III in 1957, to the Richard of Robert Helpmann, and Lady Bracknell in The Importance of Being Earnest in 1959. At the first Chichester Festival, July to September 1962, Compton played Grausis in The Broken Heart, and Marya in Uncle Vanya. Her other stage roles of the 1960s included Mrs Malaprop in The Rivals, and her last Barrie role, the Comtesse in What Every Woman Knows. Compton was awarded the CBE in 1975. She died on 12 December 1978 in London at the age of 84. Film and television Compton's film work is not as well known as her stage appearances. She appeared in more than 40 films between 1914 and 1970. Her most popular performances in films are Odd Man Out (1947), Laughter in Paradise (1951), Orson Welles' Othello (1952), The Haunting (1963) and I Start Counting (1969). Among her television performances, she appeared in 1965 with Michael Hordern in the television play Land of My Dreams by Clive Exton. Among her last major roles were Aunt Ann in the BBC's 1967 television adaptation of The Forsyte Saga, and Mrs Brown the old rag dealer in a BBC adaptation of Dicken's Dombey and Son in 1969.BFI Archive - BBC series Dombey and Son (1969) accessed 26 February 2020.

The practice  In Orthodox Jewish circles, dating is limited to the search for a marriage partner. Both sides (usually the parents, close relatives or friends of the persons, and the singles themselves, involved) make inquiries about the prospective partner, e.g. on his/her character, intelligence, level of learning, financial status, family and health status, appearance and level of religious observance. A shidduch often begins with a recommendation from family members, friends or others who see matchmaking as a mitzvah, or commandment. Some engage in it as a profession and charge a fee for their services. Usually a professional matchmaker is called a shadchan, but anyone who makes a shidduch is considered the shadchan for it. After the match has been proposed, the prospective partners meet a number of times to gain a sense of whether they are right for one another. The number of dates prior to announcing an engagement may vary by community. In some, the dating continues several months. In stricter communities, the couple may decide a few days after originally meeting with each other. Also the age when shidduchim start may vary by community. In frum circles, especially among Hassidim, eighteen is the age when shidduchim start and shadchanim take notice. Those who support marriage by shidduch believe that it complies with traditional Judaism's outlook on Tzniut, modest behaviour in relations between men and women,\\"we abstain from touching before marriage.\\" and prevents promiscuity. It may also be helpful in small Jewish communities where meeting prospective marriage partners is limited, and this gives them access to a broader spectrum of potential candidates. If the shidduch does not work out, then usually the shadchan is contacted and it is he/she that tells the other side that it will not be going ahead. If the shidduch works out then the couple inform the shadchan of its success. In recent years, a number of shidduchim sites have appeared on the Internet.  Bashow  The prospective partners either date each other or in stricter communities they go to a \\"bashow\\" or sit in.They don't \\"go out.\\" The practice has been called \\"a chaperoned quasi-date.\\" A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house (or that of someone hosting)\\"We had made up to meet in a friend's house, to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.  Bashert  Bashert (or beshert; Yiddish: ) means \\"destiny\\". It is often used to refer to one's divinely foreordained spouse or soulmate, who is called one's basherte (female) or basherter (male). It can also be used to express the seeming fate or destiny of an auspicious or important event, friendship, or happening. In modern usage, Jewish singles will say that they are looking for their bashert, meaning they are looking for that person who will complement them perfectly, and whom they will complement perfectly. Since it is considered to have been Heavenly foreordained whom one will marry, one's spouse is considered to be one's bashert by definition, independent of whether the couple's marital life works out well or not.Yevamot, 63b = Zivug = A somewhat related word is zivug. The word includes the letters for the Hebrew word zug, pair; the transliteration subsets/matches too.  Biblical matchmaking  The first recorded shidduch in the Torah was the match that Eliezer, the servant of the Jewish patriarch Abraham, made for his master's son Isaac (Genesis Ch. 24). Abraham gave him specific instructions to choose a woman from Abraham's own tribe. Eliezer traveled to his master's homeland to fulfill Abraham's wishes, arriving at a well. After a short prayer to God for guidance, describing how a virtuous woman might act toward a traveling stranger at the well, Rebekah appeared on the scene and did everything described in Eliezer's prayer. Eliezer then went with Rebekah to her family and appealed to them for permission to take Rebekah back with him to be Isaac's wife. Once this permission was granted, Rebekah joined Eliezer on the road home to Isaac. Even so, Isaac gained his own impression of her before agreeing to marry her (Rashi, commentary to Genesis 24:67). However, when Eliezer proposes to take Rebekah back to Isaac in Canaan, he is told by Rebekah's family: \\"Let us ask the maiden\\" (i.e., Rebekah). This is taken as an instruction for Jewish parents to weigh their child's opinion in the balance during an arranged marriage. Regardless of whether proper procedure is followed, this is not the end of the decision - it is believed by Jews that the final say belongs to God, who may have different plans (compare with the match of Jacob and Leah).  Talmudic references  The Talmud (Bavli Kiddushin 12a, first version) states that academy head Abba Arikha would give corporal punishment to a man who would marry without shidduchin, that is,Rashi Kiddushin 13a, Bedishadich (◊ë◊ì◊©◊ì◊ô◊ö) without prearrangement by the couple. The text gives three versions of his practice; the other two versions disagree. Some authorities rule according to the first version,Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Women, Laws of Ishut, 3:22 and Sanctity, Laws of Prohibited Relations, 21:14Joseph Karo, Shulchan Aruch, III:26:4 while others rule according to the other two versions.Hagahot Maimoniot on Mishneh Torah, Sanctity, ad. loc.Rema on Shulchan Aruch ad. loc. In Kiddushin 41a states that a man should not marry a woman he has not seen, lest he come to violate \\"love your neighbour as yourself\\". The etymology of the words \\"shidduch\\" and \\"shadchan\\" is uncertain. The medieval rabbi Nissim of Gerona (commonly called Ran) traces it back to the Aramaic word for \\"calm\\" (cf. Targum to the Book of Judges 5:31), and elaborates that the main purpose of the shidduch process is for young people to \\"settle down\\" into marriage.  Shadchan  ' (, plural / , female / ) is a Hebrew word for matchmaker. The word refers to people who carry out as a profession within the religious Jewish community. However, can also be used to refer to anyone who introduces two single Jews to one another with the hope that they will form a couple. One of the characters in the musical Fiddler on the Roof is a matchmaker named Yente. Because of this, the name () is sometimes mistakenly taken to be a synonym for . = Shadchanus gelt = ' () is the money (, ) paid to the party/partiesSometimes split equally, depending on the situation. who brokered a successful pairing. It is a brokerage fee, not a gift, and can't be paid from funds intended for charity ( ). Usually it is paid by the parents, and it is common that each pays an equal amount.  A Bat-Kohen  Although Torah law allows for a bat-kohen to marry a challal, convert, or freed slave (Hebrew eved meshukhrar), the Midrash and Talmud cite Johanan bar Nappaha's view that a daughter of the kohen is best off marrying a kohen. Rabbi Yochanan maintains that in the event a bat-kohen marries a non- Kohen, undesired results for the groom are likely to surface, such as poverty or the demise of the groom. An exception to this taboo is if the groom is a Talmid Chacham.Yalkut Shimoni to Leviticus p. 738 (HaMaor edition), Talmud Pesachim p. 49a  Medical aspects  Considering the prevalence of a number of genetic diseases in both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities, several organisations (most notably Dor Yeshorim) routinely screen large groups of young people anonymously, only handing them a telephone number and a PIN. When a shidduch is suggested, the candidates can phone the organisation, enter both their PINs, and find out whether their union could result in critically disabled children. Although the implementation has been controversial, there has been a sharp decrease in the number of children born with Tay‚ÄìSachs disease and other genetic disorders since its inception.Leiman, Yehoshua. \\"Yosef Eckstein - Trailblazer in Genetics for the Jewish World and Beyond\\".

Danube Bulgar The language of the Danube Bulgars (or Danube Bulgar) is recorded in a small number of inscriptions, which are found in Pliska, the first capital of Danube Bulgaria, and in the rock churches near the village of Murfatlar, present-day Romania. Some of these inscriptions are written with Greek characters, others with runes similar to the Orkhon script. Most of them appear to have a private character (oaths, dedications, inscriptions on grave stones) and some were court inventories. Although attempts at decipherment have been made, none of them has gained wide acceptance. These inscriptions in Danube Bulgar are found along with other official ones written in Greek. Greek was used as the official state language of Danube Bulgaria until the 9th century, when it was replaced by Old Bulgarian (Slavonic). The language of the Danube Bulgars is also known from a small number of loanwords in the Old Bulgarian language, as well as terms occurring in Bulgar Greek-language inscriptions, contemporary Byzantine texts, and later Slavonic Old Bulgarian texts. Most of these words designate titles and other concepts concerning the affairs of state, including the official 12-year cyclic calendar (as used in the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans). The language became extinct in Danubian Bulgaria in the 9th century as the Bulgar nobility became gradually Slavicized after the Old Bulgarian tongue was declared as official in 893. Volga Bulgar The language spoken by the population of Volga Bulgaria is known as Volga-Bulgar. There are a number of surviving inscriptions in Volga-Bulgar, some of which are written with Arabic letters, alongside the continuing use of Orkhon script. These are all largely decipherable. That language persisted until the 13th or the 14th century. In that region, it may have ultimately given rise to the Chuvash language, which is most closely related to itClark, Larry. 1998. \\"Chuvash.\\" In: Johanson, Lars & √âva Agnes Csat√≥ (ed.). 1998.

Since the comparative material attributable to the extinct members of Oghuric (Khazar and Bulgar) is scant, little is known about any precise interrelation of these languages and it is a matter of dispute whether Chuvash, the only \\"Lir\\"-type language with sufficient extant linguistic material, might be the daughter language of any of these or just a sister branch.

In June 1590 Worcester travelled to Edinburgh to congratulate James VI of Scotland on his safe return from Denmark and marriage to Anne of Denmark, and gave notice that the king was to join the Order of the Garter.Joseph Bain, Hamilton Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1892), p. 710. He discussed with James rumours that English ships had lain in wait for his return. At first, he was not able to see Anne of Denmark who had toothache, and he joked that in England this would be interpreted as a sign she was pregnant. Worcester had an audience with Anne, and took her letter to Elizabeth. He was accompanied by Lord Compton who watched 'pastimes' or hunting on the sands of Leith.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 324-5, 331. In 1593 he was made a Knight of the Garter. In 1606 he was appointed Keeper of the Great Park, a park created for hunting by Henry VIII around Nonsuch Palace, of which Worcester Park was a part. The residence Worcester Park House was built in 1607. Family He married Lady Elizabeth Hastings in December 1571. She was a daughter of Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon and Catherine Pole. Catherine was a daughter of Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu and Jane Neville. Jane was in turn a daughter of George Nevill, 4th Baron Bergavenny and his wife Margaret, daughter of Hugh Fenn. They had fifteen children among whom were: *Henry Somerset, 5th Earl of Worcester, his heir and successor, who was later created the 1st Marquess of Worcester; *Thomas Somerset, 1st Viscount Somerset (Peerage of Ireland), who was born in 1579, died in 1649; he was created Viscount Somerset on 8 December 1626; in 1616 he married Helen Barry ‚Äì her third marriage -, with whom he had one daughter: **Elizabeth Somerset, who might have died young, but that is unsure; *Lady Catherine or Katherine Somerset, who died on 6 November 1654 and, before 14 January 1607, married Thomas Windsor, 6th Baron Windsor, with whom she had no issue; and *Lady Blanche Somerset, who died 28 October 1649, and married Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour, with whom she had one son and two daughters, his only children; the settlement for this marriage was on 11 May 1607. *Lady Frances Somerset, wife of William Morgan, esquire of LlantarnamJohn Burke and John Bernard Burke., Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies, pp. 369‚Äì370 and mother of Edward Morgan (c. 1612 ‚Äì 24 June 1653), who was the great-great grandfather of Daniel Boone. * Sir Charles Somerset (1587/8 ‚Äì 1665), traveller and writer, Knight of the Bath. * Lady Elizabeth Somerset, married Sir Henry Guildford. * Lady Katherine Somerset (1575-1624), married William Petre, 2nd Baron Petre.

Macmillan. was an English baroque composer and organist, best known for his Trumpet Voluntary, a popular piece often played at wedding ceremonies. Biography The exact date of Clarke's birth has been debated. The Dictionary of National Biography states that Clarke \\"is said to have been born in 1669 (though probably the date should be earlier).\\" Most sources say that he is thought to have been born in London around 1674. Clarke was one of the pupils of John Blow at St Paul's Cathedral and a chorister in 1685 at the Chapel Royal. Between 1692 and 1695 he was an organist at Winchester College, then between 1699 and 1704 he was an organist at St Paul's Cathedral.Dennis Shrock William Marshall (Editor) He later became an organist and 'Gentleman extraordinary' at the Chapel Royal, he shared that post with fellow composer William Croft,John Calvert his friend. They were succeeded by John Blow. Today, Clarke is best remembered for a popular keyboard piece that was originally either a harpsichord piece or a work for wind ensemble: the Prince of Denmark's March, which is commonly called the Trumpet Voluntary, written in about 1700.Norris, Gerald (1981) A musical gazetteer of Great Britain & Ireland p. 61. David & Charles. From c. 1878 until the 1940s the work was attributed to Henry Purcell, and was published as Trumpet Voluntary by Henry Purcell in William Spark's Short Pieces for the Organ, Book VII, No. 1 (London, Ashdown and Parry). This version came to the attention of Sir Henry J. Wood, who made two orchestral transcriptions of it, both of which were recorded.Grove V, Vol. VIII, \\"Trumpet Voluntary\\" The recordings further cemented the erroneous notion that the original piece was by Purcell. Clarke's piece is a popular choice for wedding music, and has been used in royal weddings.Fox, Dan (2007) World's Greatest Wedding Music: 50 of the Most Requested Wedding Pieces p. 7.

The famous Trumpet Tune in D (also incorrectly attributed to Purcell) was taken from the semi-opera The Island Princess (1699\\"The Island Princess\\" , classicalarchives.com), which was a joint musical production of Clarke and Daniel Purcell (Henry Purcell's younger brother or cousin)‚Äîprobably leading to the confusion.Matthews, Bette (2004) Wedding for All Seasons p. 119.

Clarke's suicide \\"A violent and hopeless passion for a very beautiful lady of a rank superior to his own\\" caused Clarke to commit suicide. Apparently, he fell madly in love with one of his female students, a young, beautiful woman, of much higher social rank than he. But the woman was out of his league in every way, and he couldn't bear it. He thus decided that life wasn't worth living. Clarke had been visiting a friend who lived in the countryside. He abruptly determined to leave and return to London. His friend observed his dejection, and disappointment in love, and furnished him with a horse and a servant to take care of him. While riding near London, a fit of melancholy seized him on the road; he alighted, giving the horse to the servant. He went into a field, where there was a pond surrounded by trees, and stood on the bank of the pond. He began thinking of a suicide method, which he could not really decide on, debating with himself whether he should drown himself in the pond or hang himself on the trees. So, to decide his fate, he tossed a coin in the water. The coin fell with its edge embedded in the clay, so Clarke mounted his horse, returned to London, and went back to his home in the churchyard of St Paul's Cathedral. Instead of consoling himself, he therefore chose another method of suicide; he shot himself in the head with a pistol. Suicides were not generally granted burial in consecrated ground, but an exception was made for Clarke, who was buried in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral\\"Jeremiah Clarke\\", Classical.com (though other sources state he was buried in the unconsecrated section of the cathedral churchyard.) = Controversy = Like his date of birth, the account of his death has also been debated in some sources. For example, the story of the composer's suicide is contradicted by a contemporary broadsheet which seems to have escaped the notice of his biographers. It is a large single sheet, entitled 'A Sad and Dismal Account of the Sudden and Untimely Death of Mr. Jeremiah Clark, one of the Queen's Organists, who Shot himself in the Head with a Screw Pistol, at the Golden Cup in St. Paul's-Church-Yard, on Monday Morning last, for the supposed Love of a Young Woman, near Pater-noster-Row.' This account states how Clarke, a bachelor with a salary of over 300/. a year, about nine o'clock 'Monday morning last' was visited by his father and some friends, 'at which he seem'd to be very Chearful and Merry, by Playing on his Musick for a considerable time, which was a Pair of Organs in his own House, which he took great Delight in,' and after his father had gone returned to his room, when, between ten and eleven o'clock, his maid-servant heard a pistol go off in his room, and running in found that he had shot himself behind the ear. He died the same day about three o'clock. 'The Occasion ‚Ä¶ is variously Discours'd; some will have it that his Sister marrying his Scholar [Charles King], who he fear'd might in time prove a Rival in his Business, threw him into a kind of melancholy Discontent; and others (with something more Reason) impute this Misfortune to a young Married Woman near Pater-Noster-Row, whom he had a more than ordinary respect for, who not returning him such suitable Favours as his former Affections deserv'd, might in a great Measure occasion dismal Effects.' Very curious discrepancies exist as to the exact date of when Clarke shot himself. While most sources give the date as 1 December 1707, music historian Charles Burney (followed by Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis) says that the event took place on 16 July 1707; the first edition of John Hawkins fixes it as 5 November 1707, in which he has been followed by Arthur Mendel, David Baptie, and Brown. But Hawkins left a copy of his 'History,' in which he had made numerous corrections, and in this the date appears as 1 December 1707, which date is given in the 1853 edition of the work. In the Chapel Royal Cheque Book is an entry, signed by the sub-dean, to the effect that on 5 November 1707 Croft was admitted into the organist's place, 'now become void by the death of Mr. Jeremiah Clerk,' and in Barrett's English Church Composers (p. 106) is a statement that the books of the vicars-choral of St. Paul's contain an entry to the effect that on 'November ye first, Mr. Jerry Clarke deceased this life.' These various accounts seem quite irreconcilable, but the following facts throw some light on the subject: 1. In 1707, 5 November was a Wednesday, and 1 November a Saturday, while 1 December was a Monday. The latter date therefore tallies with the broadsheet account, published (by John Johnson, 'near Stationers' Hall,' and therefore close to Clarke's house) within a week of the event, though no entry of the exact date of publication can be found at Stationers' Hall. 2. The burial register of St Gregory by St Paul's records the burial of Jeremiah Clarke on 3 December 1707. 3. Administration to his goods was granted by the dean and chapter of St. Paul's to his sister, Ann King, on 15 December 4. The entry in the Chapel Royal Cheque Book was probably not made at the time, and so November might easily have been written instead of December. The order of the entries preceding and following it is this: 28 January 1703, 24 March 1710‚Äì11, 25 May 1704, 5 November 1707, 12 June 1708. The entry also is not witnessed. With regard to the quotation from the records at St. Paul's, everything points to its being either a mistake or a misprint. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this article it is impossible to verify the statement, part of the vicars-choral's records being inaccessible.

Earl of Worcester is a title that has been created five times in the Peerage of England. The first creation came in 1138 in favour of the Norman noble Waleran de Beaumont. He was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, by Elizabeth of Vermandois, and the twin brother of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester. Like his father and brother he also held the title Count of Meulan in the French nobility. The earldom of Worcester apparently became extinct on his death in 1166. The second creation came in 1397 in favour of the military commander and governor Thomas Percy. He was a younger son of Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy, and Mary of Lancaster, and the brother of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. He fought in the Hundred Years' War for Richard II, against whom he later rebelled. After the Battle of Shrewsbury, he was beheaded for treason and his honours forfeit, although he was without issue anyway. The third creation came in 1420 in favour of Richard Beauchamp, 2nd Baron Bergavenny. He was the son of William de Beauchamp, younger son of Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick and Katherine Mortimer. William de Beauchamp was summoned to Parliament as \\"Willilmo Beauchamp de Bergavenny\\" on 23 July 1392, by which he is held to have become Baron Bergavenny. The earldom of Worcester became extinct on the death of its first holder in 1422, while the barony was passed on to his daughter and only child, Elizabeth. See Baron Bergavenny for further history of this title. The fourth creation came in 1449 in favour of John Tiptoft, 2nd Baron Tiptoft, a noted scholar and sometime favourite of Edward IV. After the Lancastrians were restored to power under Henry VI, Worcester was captured and beheaded, with his titles forfeited. However, they were restored the following year in favour of his second and only surviving son Edward. Edward died at an early age in 1486. On his death the earldom became extinct while the barony became either extinct or fell into abeyance between his aunts. The barony of Tiptoft had been created on 7 January 1426 when the first Earl's father, John Tiptoft, was summoned to Parliament. He had previously served as Speaker of the House of Commons and Lord High Treasurer. The fifth creation came in 1514 in favour of Charles Somerset, the legitimised son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset. The fifth Earl was made Marquess of Worcester in 1643 and the third Marquess Duke of Beaufort in 1682. See the latter title for more information on this creation.

In 1988, he founded the National Union for Democracy and Development (UNDD).Patrick Rajoelina, Madagascar, le duel (2003), page 206 . In 1992, Zafy stood as a presidential candidate against President Didier Ratsiraka. The election soon became a run-off between the two candidates.

Marcus, \\"Political change in Madagascar: populist democracy or neopatrimonialism by another name?\\" , Institute for Security Studies, Occasional Paper 89, August 2004. During his presidency, Zafy received poor polling numbers due to an economic decline with accusations of corruption in his office. He was impeached in 1996 and then defeated by Ratsiraka in the 1996 presidential election.Guy Arnold, Madagascar: Year in Review 1996, Britannica.com.

After his return to Madagascar he became Minister of Public Health and Social Affairs under Gabriel Ramanantsoa. After Didier Ratsiraka took power in 1975, Zafy resigned from the government and joined the University of Madagascar.Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience (1999), ed. Kwame Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates, Jr., page 2039. Early political career =Opposition leader in the early 1990s= In 1988 he founded the National Union for Democracy and Development (UNDD). At a national conference of the opposition in 1990, Zafy was elected as President of the Committee of Active Forces (CFV), a cooperation group of several opposition parties, including Zafy's UNDD. On 16 July 1991, the CFV declared the creation of an alternative government, with Zafy as its Prime Minister. Zafy was detained for a week in late July 1991 and was met with a crowd of about 100,000 supporters upon his release.\\"Madagascar Offers Coalition\\", The New York Times, 31 July 1991, section A, page 3. He was subsequently wounded during a protest. The opposition was ultimately successful in forcing Ratsiraka to agree to the Panorama Convention, which established a transitional government and stripped Ratsiraka of most of his powers, on 31 October 1991. Zafy oversaw the transition as head of the High State Authority,\\"Madagascar's Leader Agrees To Work for New Elections\\", The New York Times, 3 November 1991. which, along with the Social and Economic Recovery Council, replaced the Supreme Revolutionary Council and the National Assembly during the 1991‚Äì1993 transitional period.\\"Nov 1991 ‚Äì New government\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 37, November 1991 Madagascar, Page 38565.World Factbook on Madagascar, 1993.

In the second round, held on 10 February 1993, Zafy won the presidency with 66.74% of the vote. He took office in late March‚Äìthe first time since Madagascar's independence in 1960 that an incumbent president peacefully transferred power to an elected member of the opposition. In June 1993, Zafy's supporters won a majority in parliamentary elections. Presidency (1993‚Äì1996) =Tenure= In office, Zafy's rivalry with Prime Minister Francisque Ravony led him to seek increased powers, and in September 1995 a successful referendum was held that substantially increased the powers of the president. This gave him authority over the selection of the prime minister, a decision that was previously in the hands of the National Assembly; following the referendum, the National Assembly was required to send three names of candidates to the president, from which he could choose. The president also gained the ability to dismiss the prime minister without requiring new elections. Ravony resigned in October 1995, and Zafy appointed Emmanuel Rakotovahiny, who was the head of the UNDD and had been Minister of State for Rural Development and Land Reform, in his place.\\"Oct 1995 ‚Äì Resignation of Prime Minister\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 41, October 1995 Madagascar, Page 40764.Guy Arnold, Madagascar: Year in Review 1995, Britannica.com. Zafy's time in office was widely seen as being marked by economic decline, which negatively impacted his popularity, and amid accusations of corruption and abuse of power, he was impeached by the National Assembly on 26 July 1996. The impeachment was backed by more than the necessary two-thirds majority; out of 134 deputies present, 99 voted in favor of the motion, 32 against it, and there were three null votes. On 4 September, the High Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment.\\"Emp√™chement du Pr√©sident de la R√©publique\\", D√©cision n¬∞17-HCC/D3(Emp√™chement), High Constitutional Court website . On 5 September, Zafy announced that he would leave office on 10 October, and he described his impeachment as a \\"constitutional coup d'√©tat\\" that occurred as a result of his criticism of the National Assembly. Although he could not delay his departure from office, he was able to stand as a candidate in the late 1996 presidential election called as a result of his impeachment.Philip M. Allen, \\"Madagascar: Impeachment as Parliamentary Coup d'Etat\\", in Checking Executive Power: Presidential Impeachment in Comparative Perspective (2003), ed. Jody C. Baumgartner, Naoko Kada, page 90. =1996 re- election bid and defeat= In his 1996 campaign, Zafy blamed the problems faced by Madagascar during his presidency on his opponents and the International Monetary Fund, and he downplayed the charges against him that had led to his impeachment. Although he had lost much of his support, in the first round of the election, held on 3 November, he was able to take second place with 23.39% of the vote, behind Ratsiraka's 36.61%. Zafy received some support in the second round from those who, despite their criticisms of Zafy, felt he was preferable to Ratsiraka, such as Interim President Norbert Ratsirahonana, who had unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in the first round. In the second round, held on 29 December, Zafy narrowly lost to Ratsiraka, taking 49.29% of the vote and losing by about 45,000 votes. He later alleged that the High Constitutional Court had switched the numbers for himself and Ratsiraka and said that he had not spoken of that at the time for the sake of peace. Post-presidency (1997‚Äì2017) =Opposition leader under Ratsiraka= Zafy led an attempt to impeach Ratsiraka in early 1998, accusing him of various charges, including perjury and nepotism; he also accused Ratsiraka of violating the constitution in his moves toward decentralization and the strengthening of the presidency at the expense of the National Assembly's power. The impeachment motion failed in the National Assembly on 4 February 1998 when only 60 deputies voted in favor of it, well short of the necessary 92. Zafy subsequently won a seat in the May 1998 parliamentary election, becoming the oldest deputy in the National Assembly. He also unsuccessfully sought the secession of Antsiranana Province from Madagascar at around the same time.\\"Ex-President Zafy reportedly seeking secession of northern province\\", Malagasy National Radio (nl.newsbank.com), 12 November 1997. On 31 August 2001, Zafy announced that he would again run in the December 2001 presidential election.\\"Madagascar: Former president says he will stand in next elections\\", AFP (nl.newsbank.com), 1 September 2001. On that occasion, he placed a distant third with about 5% of the vote. Opposition candidate Marc Ravalomanana prevailed in an extended dispute with Ratsiraka over the election results, and Ratsiraka fled into exile. =Opposition leader under Ravalomanana= Zafy became the leader of the National Reconciliation Committee (CRN), which was founded in June 2002 to promote national reconciliation among the leading participants in the political crisis that followed the 2001 election.\\"Madagascan opposition parties talk business\\", AFP (IOL), 1 June 2005. During Ravalomanana's presidency, Zafy and the CRN were viewed as part of the radical opposition in Madagascar. Zafy strongly criticized Ravalomanana and called for a new constitution. A grenade exploded outside Zafy's home early on 8 July 2004, causing some damage but no injuries.\\"MADAGASCAR: Grenade explodes outside ex-president's home\\", IRIN, 9 July 2004. This occurred in the midst of a series of grenade attacks across the country.\\"MADAGASCAR: Security beefed up after grenade attacks\\", IRIN, 12 July 2004. On 8 December 2006, Zafy's property was raided by police as part of the government's investigation regarding General Fidy, who allegedly attempted a coup in November, and presidential candidate Pety Rakotoniaina, both of whom the police sought to locate and arrest.

Zafy expressed his objections to the transitional government at a press conference on 1 April, complaining that Rajoelina would not take his advice; he also said that he would seek provincial autonomy. Bruno was nevertheless present at the national conference which began on 2 April and was promoted by Rajoelina's government.\\"National conference opens to seek solution to crisis in Madagascar\\", Xinhua (People's Daily Online), 3 April 2009. Zafy in September 2012 On 4 August 2009, as part of negotiations for a solution to the political crisis, Zafy met with Rajoelina, Ravalomanana, and Ratsiraka, along with former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, who acted as mediator at the four-day-long mediation crisis talks held in Maputo. An extended process of negotiations between the four leaders resulted in a power-sharing agreement, but by December 2009 that agreement had effectively collapsed. Rajoelina's government initially barred Zafy and others from returning to Madagascar after the talks, but later he was allowed to return. In the wake of the power-sharing agreement's collapse, Zafy declared on 18 December 2009, that the opposition would form its own government of national unity. He denounced Rajoelina, saying that Rajoelina had \\"reneged on his signature\\" and that the opposition could \\"no longer trust him to run the country\\".

He was best known as the co-founder, rhythm guitarist, backing vocalist, and songwriter of the rock band AC/DC. Except for a brief absence in 1988, he was with the band from its beginning in 1973 until retiring in 2014 due to health reasons. As a member of AC/DC, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. Though his younger brother Angus was the more visible of the brothers, Malcolm was described as the driving force and the leader of the band. In 2014, he stated that despite his retirement from the band, AC/DC was determined to continue making music with his blessing. As the rhythm guitarist, he was responsible for the broad sweep of the band's sound, developing many of their guitar riffs and co-writing the band's material with Angus. Young left AC/DC in mid-2014 to receive treatment for dementia. In September 2014, the band's management announced that he would be retiring permanently. He died from the effects of dementia on 18 November 2017. Early life Young's father, William Young (born 16 February 1911), lived with his family at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill district of Glasgow. William worked first as a wheel boy in a rope works and then as a machine and saw operator in an asbestos and cement business. In 1940, he joined the Royal Air Force and served in World War II as a flight engine mechanic. After the war, he worked as a yard man for a builder and then as a postman. He married Margaret (born 14 July 1913; maiden name also Young), who was a housewife. The \\"big freeze\\" of 1963 was one of the worst winters on record in the UK, with snow deep. A TV advertisement shown in Britain at that time offered assisted travel for families to start a different life in Australia. 15 members of the Young family left Britain in late June 1963, including fifth son George (1946‚Äì2017) and younger brothers Malcolm (born 6 January 1953) and Angus (born 31 March 1955). Also on board were his eldest brother Stephen (1933‚Äì1989), his only sister Margaret Horsburgh (born 2 May 1935), and brother William Jr (born 15 December 1940). Another elder brother, Alex (1938‚Äì1997), stayed in the UK and was later a member of London-based group Grapefruit. Another brother, John (born 17 May 1937), had migrated to Australia separately. Malcolm later described the family's musical background: \\"All the males in our family played, Stevie, the oldest played accordion, Alex and John were the first couple to play guitar, and being older it was sort of passed down to George, then myself, then Angus.\\" Initially staying at Villawood Migrant Hostel (a site later turned into Villawood Immigration Detention Centre) in Nissen huts, George met and became friends with another migrant, Harry Vanda. The Young family then moved into a semi-detached house at 4 Burleigh Street in the Sydney suburb of Burwood. Music career Young in 1990 Both Angus and Malcolm Young were in a band with their brother George and his music partner Harry Vanda called Marcus Hook Roll Band. The project released an album in Australia called Tales of Old Grand Daddy. Malcolm Young played guitar on the 1974 release \\"Evie\\" by Stevie Wright, written and produced by Harry Vanda and George Young. The song is 11 minutes long and has three parts. Young played the guitar solo in Part One of the song. Malcolm Young was in a short lived Newcastle-based band The Velvet Underground (not the well-known 1960s band). Malcolm Young was 20 when he and younger brother Angus formed AC/DC in 1973. Angus was on lead guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, Colin Burgess on drums, Larry Van Kriedt on bass guitar and Dave Evans on vocals. \\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl,\\" their first single, was later re- recorded with Bon Scott as their vocalist. They decided upon the name AC/DC after seeing the letters \\"AC/DC\\" on the back of their sister Margaret's sewing machine. In 1975 AC/DC had moved to Melbourne. In early 1977 they returned to Britain and began a European tour with Black Sabbath. While Bon Scott and Ozzy Osbourne quickly became friends, some other members of the two bands did not get on so well. In one incident, Young alleged that Geezer Butler pulled a knife on him, although Butler has since refuted that. Towards the end of 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to find someone who could sing backup vocals with him. Evans described disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by Cliff Williams. In 1988, Young missed the majority of AC/DC's Blow Up Your Video World Tour to address alcohol abuse issues. He eventually became sober and returned to the band. During his absence he was replaced by his nephew, Stevie Young. Playing guitar in AC/DC from 1973 until his last live gig with the band in June 2010, Malcolm Young toured the world with few breaks on a 37 year run with the band. He continued to write songs in AC/DC until his self imposed departure from the band in 2014https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-malcolm-youngs-last-ever-gig- acdc-2160766, being replaced once again by his nephew Stevie. During production of their album Power Up, a source inside the band leaked that they were working with tracks that Malcolm recorded before his passing, recordings even going as far back as 2003. Illness and death At the conclusion of the Black Ice World Tour, Young was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was treated at an early stage, so surgery was successful and the cancer was removed. He also had an unspecified heart problem and had a pacemaker. In April 2014, Young became seriously ill and was unable to continue performing. On 16 April 2014, AC/DC released a note stating that Young would be \\"taking a break from the band due to ill health\\". However, singer Brian Johnson stated that despite earlier reports, AC/DC are not retiring: \\"We are definitely getting together in May in Vancouver. We're going to pick up guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we'll record it.\\" In July, Johnson revealed that Young was in hospital receiving treatment for an unspecified condition and during May recording sessions had been replaced in the studio by guitarist Stevie Young, his nephew. On 24 September 2014, the band's management announced that Young was officially retiring and would not be rejoining AC/DC. Stevie Young continued to fill in for Malcolm on the band's 2015 Rock or Bust World Tour and eventually became his full-time replacement. On 26 September 2014, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Young had been diagnosed with dementia and had been admitted to a nursing home where he could receive full-time care. A source close to Young was quoted in this article as saying that he had \\"complete loss of short-term memory\\". Young's family confirmed four days later that he had dementia, saying that Young \\"is suffering from dementia and the family thanks you for respecting their privacy\\". In subsequent interviews, Angus stated that his brother had been experiencing lapses in memory and concentration before the Black Ice project and had been receiving treatment during the Black Ice World Tour which ended in 2010. Angus confirmed that although his brother did not play on the 2014 Rock or Bust album: \\"He still likes his music. We make sure he has his Chuck Berry, a little Buddy Holly.\\" He added that AC/DC would continue according to his brother's wishes and standards: \\"Look, even with his health, Malcolm was touring until he couldn't do it anymore.\\" In that same interview, Angus stated that Young was rehearsing AC/DC's songs repeatedly before every concert just to remember how they went. In an interview with Guitar Player about Young's songwriting credits in Rock or Bust, Angus stated: Young died from the disease on 18 November 2017 at the age of 64, at Lulworth House in Elizabeth Bay. His funeral was held at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney on 28 November. Young's elder brother George Young died a few weeks before him, on 22 October 2017. Legacy and influence A street artist painting a Young portrait one day after the musician died Influenced by 1950s rock and roll and blues-based rock guitarists of the 1960s and 1970s, Young was regarded as a leading rock exponent of rhythm guitar. Guitar Player magazine has stated that the secret to Young's guitar technique was playing open chords through a series of Marshall amplifiers, set to low volume without high gain. This is contrary to a common belief of many rock guitarists that rhythm guitar should involve loud and overdriven power chords. Dave Mustaine of Megadeth stated in a 2004 interview that he considered himself, Young, Rudolf Schenker, and James Hetfield of Metallica to be the best rhythm guitarists in the world. In 2006, he was the subject of a song (and album) title by Australian punk rock band Frenzal Rhomb: \\"Forever Malcolm Young\\". In 2017, Gretsch guitars reissued the Gretsch G6131MY, a signature guitar based on Young's modified 1963 Gretsch Jet Firebird. On the day of Young‚Äôs passing, several of the biggest names in rock and metal sent out tributes to Young, including Eddie Van Halen, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Guns N‚Äô Roses, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, Billy Idol, Paul Stanley of Kiss, Joe Walsh, Joe Satriani, Def Leppard, Scott Ian of Anthrax, Foo Fighters, Alice Cooper, and Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue. Many of these artists covered an AC/DC song at their concerts on the day of or around the time of Young‚Äôs passing as part of their tribute.

In the United States and Canada a period (full stop) is usually used (see Abbreviation). Mrs originated as a contraction of the honorific Mistress (the feminine of Mister or Master) which was originally applied to both married and unmarried women. The split into Mrs for married women and Miss for unmarried began during the 17th century;Spender, Dale. Man-Made Language.Stannard, Una. Mrs Man. the 17th century also saw the coinage of a new unmarked option Ms with a return of this usage appearing in the 20th century. It is rare for Mrs to be written in a non-abbreviated form, and the unabbreviated word lacks a standard spelling. In literature it may appear as missus or missis in dialogue. A variant in the works of Thomas Hardy and others is \\"Mis'ess\\", reflecting its etymology. Misses has been used but is ambiguous, as this is a commonly used plural for Miss. The plural of Mrs is from the French: Mesdames. This may be used as-is in written correspondence, or it may be abbreviated Mmes. Traditional usage Mrs was most often used by a woman when married, in conjunction with her husband's first and last names (e.g., Mrs John Smith). A widow would also be addressed with the same title as when she was married. Mrs was rarely used before a woman's first name, her birth name, or a hyphenated surname her husband was not using. For example, Mrs Jane Smith, Mrs Miller (wife of John Smith), or Mrs Miller-Smith were considered incorrect by many etiquette writers, especially of the early 20th century.Post, Emily. Etiquette. 1922. In several languages, the title for married women such as Madame, Se√±ora, Signora, or Frau, is the direct feminine equivalent of the title used for men; the title for unmarried women is a diminutive: Mademoiselle, Se√±orita, Signorina, or Fr√§ulein. For this reason, usage had shifted toward using the married title as the default for all women in professional usage. This had long been followed in the United Kingdom for some high-ranking household staff, such as housekeepers, cooks, and nannies, who were called Mrs as a mark of respect regardless of marital status. However, in the late 20th century the marital-neutral Ms became more common for women professionally and socially. In the United Kingdom, the traditional form for a divorc√©e was Mrs Jane Smith. In the U.S., the divorc√©e originally retained her full married name unless she remarried. Later, the form Mrs Miller Smith was sometimes used, with the birth surname in place of the first name. However, the form Mrs Jane Miller eventually became widely used for divorc√©es, even in formal correspondence; that is, Mrs preceded the divorc√©e's maiden name. Before social mores relaxed to the point where single women with children were socially acceptable, the unwed mother was often advised by etiquette mavens like Emily Post to use Mrs with her maiden name to avoid scrutiny. The separation of Miss and Mrs became problematic as more women entered the white-collar workforce. Women who became famous or well known in their professional circles before marriage often kept their birth names, stage names, or noms de plume. Miss became the appellation for celebrities (e.g., Miss Helen Hayes, or Miss Amelia Earhart) but this also proved problematic, as when a married woman did use her husband‚Äôs last name but was still referred to as Miss; see more at Ms and Miss. Modern usage It is now very uncommon for a woman to be addressed by her husband's first name; however, this still sometimes occurs if a couple is being addressed jointly, such as in Mr and Mrs John Smith. Many married women still use the title with their spouse's last name but retaining their first name (e.g., Mrs Jane Smith). Other married women choose not to adopt their spouse's last name at all. It is generally considered polite to address a woman by Ms rather than Mrs, unless the preference of the woman in question is clearly known. This is especially true in written communication, as dictated by professional etiquette. Modern etiquette provides various options in addressing married couples in which the wife uses her own last name, or uses a title such as Dr, Mayor, or Ms. Etiquette writer Judith Martin (\\"Miss Manners\\") generally advises that, in non-standard situations, the individuals be addressed on separate lines when writing invitations (e.g., \\"Dr Sue Martin/Mr John Martin\\"). In direct address, a woman with the title Mrs may be addressed Mrs [Lastname], or with the stand-alone Madam or Ma'am, although the latter two are more often used for any adult woman, regardless of marital status, in modern conversation. It is normally considered correct to address a woman as Ms [Lastname], regardless of her marital status. A woman who has a long-term sexual relationship with a partner who is married may be referred to as that person's \\"mistress\\".

He was the leader of Egypt's nationalist Wafd Party. He served as Prime Minister of Egypt from 26 January 1924 to 24 November 1924. Education, activism and exile Zaghloul was born in Ibyana village in the Kafr el-Sheikh Governorate of Egypt's Nile Delta. For his post-secondary education, he attended Al-Azhar University and a French law school in Cairo. By working as a Europeanized lawyer, Zaghloul gained both wealth and status in a traditional framework of upward mobility. Despite this, Zaghloul success can equally be attributed to his familiarity with the Egyptian countryside and its many idioms. In 1918, he became politically active, as the founding leader of the Wafd Party, for which he was later arrested. Rise in the bureaucracy Upon his release from prison, he practiced law and distinguished himself; amassed some independent means, which enabled him to participate in Egyptian politics, then dominated by the struggle-moderate and extreme‚Äîagainst British occupation; and effected useful, permanent links with different factions of Egyptian nationalists. He became close to Princess Nazli Fazl, and his contacts with the Egyptian upper class led to his marriage to the daughter of the Egyptian prime minister Mustafa Fahmi Pasha, whose friendship with Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, then the effective British ruler of Egypt, accounts in part for the eventual acceptability of Zaghloul to the British occupation. In succession Zaghloul was appointed judge, minister of education (1906‚Äì1908), minister of justice (1910‚Äì1912); and in 1913 he became vice-president of the Legislative Assembly. In all his ministerial positions Zaghloul undertook certain measures of reform that were acceptable to both Egyptian nationalists and the British occupation. Throughout this period, he kept himself outside extreme Egyptian nationalist factions, and although acceptable to the British occupation, he was not thereby compromised in the eyes of his Egyptian compatriots. The relationship between Britain and Egypt continued to deteriorate during and after the Great War. Exile Zaghloul became increasingly active in nationalist movements, and in 1919 he led an official Egyptian delegation (or wafd, the name of the political party he would later form) to the Paris Peace Conference demanding that the United Kingdom formally recognise the independence and unity of Egypt and Sudan (which had been united as one country under Muhammad Ali Pasha). Britain had occupied the country in 1882, and declared it a protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War. Though Egypt and Sudan had its own Sultan, parliament and armed forces, it had effectively been under British rule for the duration of the occupation. The British in turn demanded that Zaghloul end his political agitation. When he refused, they exiled him to Malta, and later to the Seychelles. In 1922 he was moved from the Seychelles and was taken to Gibraltar due to ill health arriving there on board HMS Curlew he was released in 1923. They had employed a similar tactic against Egyptian nationalist leader Ahmed Orabi in 1882, whom they exiled to Ceylon. At the time of Zaghloul's arrival in the Seychelles, a number of other prominent anti-imperialist leaders were also exiled there, including Mohamoud Ali Shire, the 26th Sultan of the Warsangali, with whom Zaghloul would soon develop a rapport. In order to avoid engendering anti-colonial sentiments, the colonial government imposed edicts which censored letters that exiled individuals sent to their family and compatriots back home. Zaghloul regularly found a way around these controls. He and other prominent exiles employed letter-writing as major non-violent political tools of communication, through which they were able to describe their time in exile beyond the Seychelles. Political history The Saad Zaghloul Pasha statue in Alexandria. Zaghloul's absence caused disturbances in Egypt, ultimately leading to the Egyptian Revolution of 1919.Eugene Rogan, The Arabs (Basic Books: New York, 2009), p. 165. Upon his return from exile, Zaghloul led the Egyptian nationalist forces. The elections of 12 January 1924 gave the Wafd Party an overwhelming majority, and two weeks later, Zaghloul formed the first Wafdist government. As P. J. Vatikiotis writes in The History of Modern Egypt (4th ed., pp. 279 ff.): Following the assassination on 19 November 1924 of Sir Lee Stack, the Sirdar and Governor-General of the Sudan, and subsequent British demands which Zaghloul felt to be unacceptable, Zaghloul resigned. Yet he returned to active politics two years later and, though he never again held the Prime Ministry, he remained an extremely influential figure until his death in 1927. Family Zaghloul's wife, Safiya KhƒÅn≈´m, was the daughter of Mustafa Fahmi Pasha, the Egyptian cabinet minister and two-time Prime Minister of Egypt. A feminist and revolutionary, she was also active in politics. Zaghloul's brother, Ahmad Fathy Zaghlul was a lawyer and politician. He had several administrative and government posts, and at one point was Deputy Minister of Justice. In 1906 he was amongst the Egyptian judges at the summary trial for the Denshawai Incident. He is buried with his wife in their Mausoleum Beit El- Umma in Cairo. Timeline * 1857 July: Born into a middle-class peasant family in Ibaynah in the Nile delta.

In 1895 he was elected member of the lower chamber of the Danish parliament (Folketinget), for the Liberal Party (Venstrereformpartiet). A campaigner for peace, in 1905 he co-founded the Social Liberal Party (Det Radikale Venstre) together with other (mostly pacifistic) disgruntled members of Venstrereformpartiet. He continued on as a member of the Folketinget for Det Radikale Venstre until 1928, when he became a member of the upper chamber of parliament (Landsting). In 1929 he became Justice Minister, a post which he held until 1935. Zahle was instrumental in starting negotiations for a new Danish‚ÄìIcelandic Act of Union (Dansk-Islandsk Forbundslov) in 1917, which resulted in Iceland being recognized as a sovereign nation in a personal union with the king of Denmark the following year.  Early life  C. Th. Zahle was born in Roskilde as the son of cobbler Christian Lauritz Gottlieb Zahle and his wife Karen Emilie. He was interested in politics already in high school and saw himself as a convinced democrat in opposition to the Estrup government. He took a degree in law in 1890 and worked for some time at newspapers for instance the newspaper Politiken. In 1894 he passed the bar exam to the high courts.  Political career  In 1895 he was elected to the lower house of the Danish Rigsdag in the Ringsted election district. He won the seat and kept it in subsequent elections until 1928 where he was elected to the upper house of parliament. He kept his seat there until 1939. He was a co-founder of the Left Reform Party (Venstrereformpartiet) in 1895 and became a member of the parliamentary finance committee in 1901. After disagreements with party leader Jens Christian Christensen (1856‚Äì1930) on the defence budget Zahle broke with his party and co-founded the Social Liberal Party (Det Radikale Venstre) in 1905 and became the first chairman of the new party. In 1909 he was able to form a minority government but had to resign as prime minister the year later following an electoral defeat for his party. In 1911 he became mayor of Stege. In 1913 the Social Liberal Party and the Social Democrats got a majority in the lower house and Zahle was able to form a government backed by the Social Democrats. This government was in office until 1920. Zahle was prime minister during World War I and the main objective for his administration during the war was to keep Denmark neutral. Zahle succeeded in this thanks to foreign minister Erik Scavenius (1877‚Äì1962). Although Denmark was neutral the war meant a scarcity of goods and materials and regulation of the economy became necessary. Danish foreign minister Ove Rode (1867‚Äì1933) was in charge of these policies. After the war the opposition had accumulated great anger towards the Zahle government. The government was accused of having been too friendly towards Germany during the war and the economic regulations limited the profits of business life. On top of that came the question about northern Schleswig and in particular Flensburg in Southern Schleswig. A referendum was held on the return of parts of Schleswig to Denmark from Germany and it was demanded that Germany should cede the city of Flensburg with no regards to the result of the referendum. Zahle refused to call for an election on this question and was deposed by King Christian X in 1920. This resulted in the Easter Crisis of 1920 (P√•skekrisen 1920) where social liberals, social democrats and socialists saw the king's dismissal of Zahle as unconstitutional. Zahle never became prime minister again but he became minister of justice under Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning (1873‚Äì1942) from 1929 to 1935. He held this portfolio in his own governments and had worked for legal reforms. From 1936 to 1939 he was speaker of the upper house. From 1936 until 1945 he was a board member of nationwide daily Politiken.

He served as Prime Minister six times, and although a leader of the monarchist faction was the third and last President of the Second Hellenic Republic. Early life and family He was born in Athens and was the son of Thrasyvoulos Zaimis, a former Prime Minister of Greece, and Eleni Mourouzi. His brother was Asimakis Zaimis. On his father's side he was the grandson of Andreas Zaimis, another former Prime Minister of Greece, and related to the great Kalavrytan family with notable participation in the Greek War of Independence from 1821. From his mother's side he was a descendant of an important Fanariote family of the Mourozidon. His family lived in Kerpini, Kalavryta in the Achaia prefecture. He studied law at the University of Athens and at the University of Heidelberg. He also attended the universities of Leipzig, Paris and Berlin. Political career Alexandros became involved in politics after the death of his father who was the elected member of parliament for Kalavryta. He became a Member of Parliament in 1885. He served as Minister of the Interior and Justice Minister in Theodoros Deligiannis' government (1890‚Äì92) and Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament (1895-97). He became Prime Minister for the first time in 1897. =Appointment as High Commissioner= In 1906, he was appointed as High Commissioner of CreteSvolopoulos, The Period of Autonomy, p. 479. and presided over a critical period of the island's history up to the de facto union of Crete with Greece in 1908. =Re-elected as Prime Minister= Alexandros Zaimis was re-elected as Prime Minister a further five times. He was appointed Prime Minister under King Constantine I to succeed Venizelos in October 1915, but resigned a month later when his government failed to receive a vote of confidence. In 1917, Zaimis served again as Prime Minister under King Constantine I, while Eleftherios Venizelos led a rival government controlling northern Greece. Under Entente pressure, he resigned in favor of Venizelos in June of the same year. During World War I, he was generally supposed to favor neutrality for Greece, but to be personally in favor of the Allies. A moderate conservative, he served again as Prime Minister in the Second Hellenic Republic, from 1926 to 1928, in a coalition government of Venizelist and moderate conservatives. Zaimis was elected the third and last President of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1929. He was reelected in 1933. However, only two years into his second term, he was thrown out of office by Georgios Kondylis, who abolished the Republic and proclaimed himself regent pending the results of a referendum on restoring the monarchy. This referendum resulted in George II being recalled to the throne by almost 98 percent of the vote, an implausibly high total that could have only been obtained through fraud. Death and legacy He died on 15 September 1936 in Vienna, Austria and was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens. He was married without children. The political legacy of his family was continued by his siblings and cousins.

According to the Suda, he was previously a slave and a shepherd, and after having been educated he gave laws to his fellow-citizens. Most probably, he devised the first written Greek law code, the Locrian code, in the 7th century BC, which among other things stipulated that: It also banned the drinking of undiluted wine except for medical purposes. Although the Locrian code distinctly favored the aristocracy, Zaleucus was famous for his conciliation of societal factions. No other facts of his life at all are certain. According to legends, he punished adultery with the forfeiture of sight. When his own son was condemned of this, he refused to exonerate him, instead submitting to the loss of one of his own eyes instead of exacting the full penalty of the culprit.This incident is recounted in Book 6, Chapter 5 of Memorable Deeds and Sayings by Valerius Maximus, and is presented in a slightly altered form in Tale 50 of Gesta Romanorum. Another law that he established forbade anyone from entering the Senate House armed. Faced with an emergency, he did so anyway, but when he was reminded of the law, he immediately fell upon his sword as a sacrifice to the sovereignty of the claims of social order. A similar story is told of Charondas. Anyone who proposed a new law, or the alteration of one already existing, had to appear before the Citizen's Council with a rope round his neck. If the Council voted against the proposal the proposer was immediately strangled.This anecdote is cited by Edward Gibbon in his discussion of the origin of Roman jurisprudence and of the Twelve Tables in particular in Chapter XLIV of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. > Demosthenes (in \\"Against Timocrates\\"), who to persuade the Athenians not to > change any law upon small and frivolous pretences, gives the example of > these Locrians, with whom, says he, it's a law, that a man who shall propose > to make any new law shall do it with a rope about his neck, which he shall > be strangled in, if he do not carry his point: which has been such a guard > and defence to the laws, that there has been but one new one made in MORE > THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS.

He served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 15 February 1901 to 3 November 1903. An eloquent orator, he was also a Grand Master freemason. Zanardelli, representing the bourgeoisie from Lombardy, personified the classical 19th-century liberalism, committed to suffrage expansion, anticlericalism, civil liberties, free trade and laissez-faire economics.De Grand, The hunchback's tailor, p. 17 Throughout his long political career, he was among the most ardent advocates of freedom of conscience and divorce.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, pp. 47‚Äì48 Early life Italian Prime Minister Zanardelli standing on a cart drawn by oxen during a visit to Basilicata in September 1902. Giuseppe Zanardelli was born in Brescia (Lombardy) on 29 October 1826. He was a combatant in the volunteer corps during the First Italian War of Independence of 1848 between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia, within the era of Italian unification (Risorgimento). After the lost battle of Novara he went to Pisa to study law, and he returned to Brescia to become a barrister.Signor Zanardelli Dead; Ex-Premier of Italy Was Seventy-four Years Old, The New York Times, 27 December 1903 Biografia Giuseppe Zanardeli, Camera dei deputati, portale storico For a time earned a livelihood by teaching law, but was molested by the Austrian police and forbidden to teach in consequence of his refusal to contribute pro-Austrian articles to the press. In 1859 he was forced to flee to Switzerland. He moved to Lugano, but returned in time to organize the insurrection of Brescia in the Second Italian War of Independence and welcomed Giuseppe Garibaldi in the city. Enlisted in the Cacciatori delle Alpi (Hunters of the Alps), he remained in the area until the armistice of Villafranca. With the annexation of Lombardy to Piedmont, he was elected to Parliament in Turin. Elected deputy in 1859, he received various administrative appointments, but only attained a political office in 1876 when the Left, of which he had been a prominent and influential member, came into power. Zanardelli became a freemason in 1860; he was initiated in the Lodge \\"Propaganda\\" of Rome. In government In 1876 he became Minister of Public Works in the first government of Agostino Depretis, and Minister of the Interior in the government of Benedetto Cairoli in 1878. In the latter capacity, he drafted the franchise reform, but created dissatisfaction by the indecision of his administrative acts, particularly in regard to the Irredentist agitation, and by his theory of repressing and not in any way preventing crime, which led for a time to an epidemic of murders.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, p. 77 Overthrown with Cairoli in December 1878, he returned to power as Minister of Justice in 1881 with the Depretis government, and succeeded in completing the commercial code. He also was the architect of the electoral reform in 1892 which lowered the voting age from 25 to 21, and reduced the minimum tax threshold for voting or allowed an elementary school certificate. Abandoned awhile by Depretis in 1883, he remained in opposition until 1887, when he again joined Depretis as Minister of Justice, retaining his portfolio throughout the ensuing government of Francesco Crispi, until 31 January 1891. During this period he began the reform of the magistracy and promulgated a new penal code, which unified penal legislation in Italy, abolished capital punishment and recognised the workers right to strike.Seton-Watson. Italy from liberalism to fascism, p. 131 The code was regarded as a great work by contemporary European jurists.

Part of the first generation raised under French colonization, Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education. His passion for French literature and traditional Malagasy poetry (ohabolana) prompted him to read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects, including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions. He published his first poems as an adolescent in local literary reviews, soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a proofreader and editor of its literary journals. He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and Malagasy as well as literary critiques, an opera, and two novels. Rabearivelo's early period of modernist-inspired poetry showed skill and attracted critical attention but adhered strictly to traditional genre conventions. The surrealist poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality, garnering him strong praise and acclaim. Despite increasing critical attention in international poetry reviews, Rabearivelo was never afforded access to the elite social circles of colonial Madagascar. He suffered a series of personal and professional disappointments, including the death of his daughter, the French authorities' decision to exclude him from the list of exhibitors at the Universal Exposition in Paris, and growing debt worsened by his philandering and opium addiction. Following Rabearivelo's suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937, he became viewed as a colonial martyr. The death of Rabearivelo occurred just prior to the emergence of the N√©gritude movement, by which time the Malagasy poet had established an international reputation among literary figures such as L√©opold S√©dar Senghor as Africa's first modern poet. The Government of Madagascar declared Rabearivelo its national poet upon independence in 1960. The legacy and influence of his works continue to be felt and his works are a focus of ongoing academic study. Modern Malagasy poets and literary figures including Elie Rajaonarison have cited him as a major inspiration. A street and a high school in Antananarivo have been named after him, as has a dedicated room in the National Library of Madagascar. Biography =Childhood= Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, born Joseph-Casimir on 4 March 1901 or 1903 in Ambatofotsy (north of Antananarivo), Madagascar, was the only child of an unwed mother descended from the Zanadralambo (\\"sons of Ralambo\\") caste of the Merina andriana (nobles). When the French colonized Madagascar in 1897, Merina nobles including Rabearivelo's mother lost the privileges, prestige, and wealth to which they had been entitled under the former monarchy, the Kingdom of Imerina. Madagascar had been a French colony for less than a decade when Rabearivelo was born, situating him among the first generation of Malagasy to grow up under the colonial system. He first studied at the Fr√®res des √âcoles Chr√©tiennes school in the affluent neighborhood of Andohalo, then transferred to the prestigious Coll√®ge Saint- Michel, where he was expelled for lack of discipline, poor academic performance, and his reluctance to become religiously observant. He ended his studies at √âcole Flacourt in 1915. He is believed to have published his first poems at age 14 in the literary review Vakio Ity under the pen name K. Verbal. After leaving school, he worked a variety of low-skilled jobs, including as a lace designer, an errand boy, and a secretary and interpreter to a district administrator. During this period he developed a passion for French 19th and 20th century literature and refined his fluency in the French language; he also began teaching himself English, Spanish, and Hebrew. He changed his name to Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo to have the same initials as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, while continuing to occasionally use pseudonyms, including \\"Amance Valmond\\" and \\"Jean Osm√©\\". He was particularly attracted to poets and writers who were outcasts in their own society, including Baudelaire and Rimbaud. =Early period= In 1920, Rabearivelo was hired as an assistant librarian at the Cercle de l'Union social club. That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the Malagasy language. He began to correspond with a wide range of writers around the world, including Andr√© Gide, Paul Val√©ry, Jean Amrouche, Paul Claudel, and Valery Larbaud, and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar. By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he took a job as a proofreader at the publishing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life. In 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony's financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine 18¬∞ Latitude Sud. He published his first collection of poems, La coupe de cendres (\\"The Cup of Ashes\\") in 1924; the same year he also translated twelve previously unpublished Malagasy language poems into French and published them in literary magazines, including 18¬∞ Latitude Sud in Antananarivo and La Vie in Paris. This publication launched him into the intellectual and cultural circles of Antananarivo high society, where he established himself as Madagascar's leader not only in poetry and prose, but as an esteemed journalist, art critic, translator, and writer of essays and plays. In 1925 he published a historical novel called L'Aube Rouge (\\"The Red Dawn\\") about the last years of the Kingdom of Imerina. In it he honored Rainandriamampandry, the governor of Toamasina who was executed by the French in 1896 for his suspected role in the Menalamba rebellion. Rabearivelo published his second and third poetry anthologies, Sylves (\\"Woodlands\\") and Volumes, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. He also published his second historical novel in 1928, L'interf√©rence (\\"Interference\\"), which depicts the life of a noble family from the last years of the monarchy until colonization. Throughout the 1920s, he translated the works of foreign poets and writers into Malagasy, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Rilke, Whitman, and G√≥ngora; he also translated traditional Malagasy kabary (oratory) into French for publication in French-language literary reviews. In 1926, Rabearivelo married Mary Razafitrimo, the daughter of a local photographer, and together they had five children. He was also a womanizer and abused alcohol and opium, growing increasingly dependent on the substances after the death of his daughter. Rabearivelo constantly struggled with debt, and despite his growing fame and artistic success, he was unable to escape from poverty. =Late period= Throughout the 1930s, Rabearivelo joined with other Malagasy poets and writers in an emerging literary movement termed \\"Hitady ny Very\\" (\\"The Search for Lost Values\\"), which sought to promote the traditional literary and oral arts of Madagascar. Together with fellow artists Charles Rajoelisolo and Ny Avana Ramanantoanina, in August 1931 he founded a literary journal called Ny Fandrosoam-baovao (\\"New Progress\\") to promote Malagasy-language poetry. He published two more anthologies of thirty poems each: Presque-Songes (\\"Dream Images\\") (1931) and Traduit de la nuit (\\"Translated from the Night\\") (1932). As an experiment, he wrote Malagasy and French versions of each poem in these two books; the French versions were published in 1934 and 1935 respectively. For the remainder of his life he focused primarily on the translation of hainteny (traditional Malagasy poetry) into French, work which was published posthumously. He also wrote Madagascar's first and only opera, Imaitsoanala (1935), named for the legendary heroine mother of King Ralambo; it was set to music composed by Andrianary Ratianarivo and was performed by Ratianarivo's Troupe Jeanette at the Municipal Theater of Isotry in Antananarivo. In 1933, his three-year-old daughter Voahangy became ill and died. Rabearivelo was deeply affected by this loss and was plunged into grief from which he never recovered. His last daughter, who was born in 1936, he named Velomboahangy (\\"Voahangy Alive\\"). The theme of death became prominent and recurrent in his works and journal. The colonial high society of Antananarivo showcased Rabearivelo's work as evidence of the success of the French assimilation policy and the beneficial effects of colonialism in Africa. In his journals, the poet wrote that he felt \\"used\\" by the French authorities in Madagascar. Governor Montagn√© awarded him an affiliation (membre correspondant) with the Acad√©mie Malgache in 1932. But in 1937, Rabearivelo's trust in the assimilation messages and gestures of Antananarivo's colonial high society was betrayed. He was imprisoned for three days for failing to pay taxes, a penalty from which he should have been exempted due to his status as a low-ranking employee of the colonial administration. He had also been promised that he would represent Madagascar at the 1937 Universal Exposition in Paris, but in May 1937 the colonial authorities informed him that he would not be part of the island's delegation. Consequently, Rabearivelo became embittered toward France and its colonial message of assimilation, a sentiment strongly expressed in his journals. He was likewise rejected by Malagasy high society, who condemned his unconventional behavior and views, particularly in light of his role as husband and father. His compatriots also held him in contempt for his perceived eagerness to embrace the French colonial rule and culture. Rabearivelo was deeply troubled by these disappointments and his worsening chronic financial troubles, in addition to the continuing grief he felt for the death of his daughter. On 19 June 1937, a French friend informed him that his hope to eventually earn a higher official role within the administrative authority could never materialize as he was largely self-taught and lacked the required diplomas. Having staked his future on a government career, Rabearivelo began to muse about his own death in his journal, writing \\"Perhaps one needs to die to be found sincere.\\" =Death= Rabearivelo committed suicide by cyanide poisoning on the afternoon of 22 June 1937. He may have been seriously ill with tuberculosis at the time. The morning of his suicide, Rabearivelo completed several unfinished works; he then took fourteen 250-milligram quinine capsules with water at 1:53 pm, followed at 2:37 pm by ten grams of potassium cyanide. Before dying he wrote a final poem and burned the first five volumes of his personal journal, the Calepins Bleus (\\"Blue Notebooks\\", 1924‚Äì1937), leaving four volumes of approximately 1,800 pages that document his life after 4 January 1933. In his final journal entries he recorded the detailed experience of his suicide, concluding with his final entry at 3:02 pm. At the time of his death, only half of his twenty literary works had been published; the remainder were printed posthumously. Style and influences Rabearivelo's first poetic work, La coupe de cendres (1924), demonstrates the evident mastery of meter and rhythm in his earliest works, despite an absence of innovation on the classic models of poetry he uses. The works that follow this initial effort can be broadly clustered into two phases, the first being highly influenced by the symbolist and romantic schools of poetry, and the second reflecting greater creativity and individuality in personal expression, and with a recurrent interest in reconciling a mental image of a \\"mythic past\\" with an \\"alienating modernity\\". In the romantic period, typified by Sylves (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of traditional models. He identified himself and his work as post-symbolist in the early part of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression. Beginning in 1931, his works begin to change in tone and show the influences of surrealism and modernism. His poems become more daring, free, and complex, while also reflecting greater doubt. According to academic Arnaud Sabatier, this change reflects \\"the rediscovery and embrace of the sound and images of traditional Malagasy poetry, from which he had previously distanced himself or which he had subjected to the colonial language and culture.\\" These later works are described by academic Claire Riffard as \\"his strangest, evoking rural and commonplace images alongside unexpected dreamlike visions, superimposing the new and the forgotten ...\\" His break from convention in this period offered greater freedom to reconcile his conflicted identity, such as through his bilingual creations, Presque-Songes (1931) and Traduit de la nuit (1932). Legacy Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo high school in Antananarivo Rabearivelo has long been considered the first modern poet of Africa. Academic Arnaud Sabatier identifies him as \\"one of the most important writers of the twentieth century\\". He has also been described by Radio France Internationale journalist Tirthankar Chanda as \\"the founder of the African francophonie\\" and \\"the enfant terrible of French literature\\". Rabearivelo is the most internationally famous and influential Malagasy literary figure. Jeune Afrique described him as \\"Madagascar's greatest poet\\", a sentiment echoed by L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, first president of Senegal and founder of the N√©gritude movement, who called him the \\"prince of the Malagasy poets\\". He was described by academic Claire Riffard as \\"one of the principal founders of contemporary Malagasy literature\\", and following national independence in 1960, the government of Madagascar affirmed his cultural contributions by promoting him as the island's national writer. Rabearivelo struggled throughout his life to reconcile his identity as Malagasy with his aspiration toward French assimilation and connection with the greater universal human experience. He has been depicted as a martyr figure as a result of his suicide following the refusal of French authorities to grant him permission to go to France. He has been the subject of a significant number of books and conferences; on the fiftieth anniversary of his death, his work was commemorated at events organized in North America, Europe and Africa, including a week-long conference at the University of Antananarivo. Recent scholarship has questioned Rabearivelo's elevation as a colonial martyr, arguing that the poet was by and large an assimilationist who did not view himself as African. The Lyc√©e Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo was inaugurated in central Antananarivo on 21 December 1946 in honor of the poet. A room has been dedicated to the poet in the National Library of Madagascar, located in the capital city. He was included in the seminal volume of poetry of the N√©gritude movement, L√©opold Senghor's Anthologie de la nouvelle poesie negre et malgache (\\"Anthology of New Black and Malagasy Poetry\\"), published in 1948. He has inspired many Malagasy writers and poets after him, including Elie Rajaonarison, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry. The Francophone University Agency and Madagascar's National Center for Scientific Research collaborated to publish the entirety of Rabearivelo's works in three volumes. The first volume, comprising his journal and some of his correspondence with key figures in literary and colonial circles, was printed in October 2010. The second volume, a compilation of all his previously published works, was released in July 2012. The remaining 1,000 pages of materials produced by Rabearivelo have been published in digital format.

His rule was disputed by Archduke Ferdinand I, who also claimed the title King of Hungary.John (king of Hungary) Britannica Online Encyclopedia He was Voivode of Transylvania before his coronation, from 1510 to 1526.  Early life  John was the oldest son of Count Stephen Z√°polya and his second wife, Hedwig of Cieszyn. Stephen Z√°polya was descended from a Croatian noble family from Slavonia. Their family name was derived from the Croatian phrase \\"za polje\\" (literally translated as \\"behind field\\").Kubinyi 2008, page: 22 Stephen became one of the wealthiest lords in the Kingdom of Hungary after inheriting the large domains of his brother, Emeric Z√°polya, in 1487. Stephen Z√°polya's marriage with the Silesian duchess, Hedwig, who was related to Emperor Maximilian I, increased the prestige of the Z√°polya family. Stephen Z√°polya had no sons when Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, died on 6 April 1490, according to a contemporaneous report, but a charter issued in September 1491 already mentioned John, showing that John was born between the two dates. He was born in Szepes Castle (now Spi≈° Castle in Slovakia), which was an important center of the Z√°polyas' domains. At the Diet of Hungary in 1497, Stephen Z√°polya's opponents circulated rumours about his intention to have his son crowned king. John and his younger brother, George, inherited their father's vast domains in 1499. Their domains were primarily located in Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), where they held most landed estates in five counties. John could write letters in Latin, showing that his mother provided excellent education to him. Hedwig of Cieszyn wanted to persuade Vladislaus II, King of Hungary and Bohemia, to marry his only child, Anne, to John. However king Vladislaus refused the idea of marriage between princess Anne and John Z√°polya.  Early career  = Party leader of the gentries = Vladislaus's brother, King Sigismund Jagiellon of Poland, came to Hungary to mediate between the royal family and the Z√°polyas in late June. Emperor Maximilian had already in September declared war on Hungary, because he wanted to protect his claim (acknowledged in the 1491 Peace of Pressburg) to succeed Vladislaus. The teenager John Z√°polya was made one of the commanders of the Hungarian army. During the war, the envoys of Vladislaus and Maximilian signed a secret treaty on 30 March 1506 about the marriage of Vladislaus's daughter, Anne, and Maximilian's grandson, Ferdinand. king Vladislaus's wife, Anne of Foix-Candale, gave birth to a son, Louis, on 1 July, which put an end to the war with Maximilian. John began his public career in 1505 as a member of the Diet of R√°kos. Due to John Z√°polya's motion,John (king of Hungary) Britannica Online Encyclopedia the new Diet at R√°kos passed a bill which prohibited the election of a foreigner as king if Vladislaus died without a male issue, on 13 October 1505. The bill was aimed at creating a legal basis for John's ascension to the throne after the death of Vladislaus, but the king refused to ratify it, and the Diet was closed by the king. John's serious conflicts with the royal court had meanwhile made him the leader of a \\"national party\\", consisting of the smaller untitled noblemen (the gentry) who were opposed to the pro-Habsburg orientation of the higher aristocracy, the higher clergy and King Vladislaus. Although the Diet initially refused to enact the right of the infant crown prince Louis to succeed king Vladislaus, but Louis was finally crowned on Vladislaus's demand on 4 June 1508. According to the late 16th-century historian Mikl√≥s Istv√°nffy, John tried to persuade Vladislaus to give princess Anne in marriage to him when the king returned from Bohemia in early 1510, but the king refused him again. John's sister Barbara Szapolyai married to Polish king Sigismund I the Old in 1512, which further increased the influence of the Szapolyai family in short term, because Barbara had died in Krakow in 1515. = Voivode of Transylvania = Royal stamp of Z√°polya Vladislaus II made John Z√°polya Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Sz√©kelys on 8 November 1510. He moved to Transylvania and took up residence in Kolozsv√°r (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) in March 1511. The Ottomans began invading the southern frontier of the Kingdom of Hungary in April 1511. John regularly held Diets for the representatives of the \\"Three Nations of Transylvania\\". He also headed the judicial assemblies of the Sz√©kely people. Vladislaus's brother, Sigismund, who had been crowned King of Poland, married John's sister, Barbara Z√°polya in early 1512, which increased John's prestige. To show off his wealth, John went with Barbara to Poland accompanied by 800 horsemen who wore gilded cloths. John made a raid in Ottoman Bulgaria in summer 1513. After returning to Transylvania, he crushed a revolt in Hermanstadt (now Sibiu in Romania) and forced the townspeople to pay an extraordinary tax. Tam√°s Bak√≥cz, Archbishop of Esztergom, declared a crusade against the Ottomans on 9 April 1514. About 40,000 peasants joined the crusade and assembled near Pest, although their lords had tried to retain them before the harvest. John launched a new campaign to Bulgaria in early May. An army of armed serfs also left Pest to invade the Ottoman Empire. During their march, they began plundering the nearby manors of noblemen. Many villagers denied to pay taxes and duties. The king and the archbishop ordered the peasants to disband on 22 May, but they refused to obey. Their bands took control of the southern lowlands along the rivers Danube and Tisza and murdered many nobles. The main army of the peasants, which was under the command of Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa, laid siege to Temesv√°r (now Timi»ôoara in Romania). Stephen B√°thory defended the town. John Z√°polya, who had returned from his Ottoman campaign, came to relieve Temesv√°r. His army routed the peasants on 15 July. The leaders of the revolt were tortured to death with much cruelty. D√≥zsa was put on a red-hot iron \\"throne\\" with a red- hot iron \\"crown\\" on his head and his compatriots were compelled to eat his flesh, before being executed. In October, the Diet deprived the peasants of the right to free movement and obliged them to work on their lords' lands without remuneration one day in every week. The Diet hailed John Z√°polya as the \\"liberator of the realm\\" and rewarded him with a payment of 20 denars for each peasant household. Mostly Z√°polya's supporters were delegated to the royal council and his friend, Gregory Frankopan, Archbishop of Kalocsa, was made chancellor. The previous chancellor, George Szatm√°ri, Archbishop of Esztergom, remained hostile to Z√°polya. Z√°polya, Stephen B√°thory, Emeric T√∂r√∂k and Michael Paksy joined forces to laid siege to ≈Ωrnov, the Ottoman fortress near N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r (now Belgrade in Serbia) in April 1515. However, Sinan, Bey of Smederovo, defeated their united troops. The defeat weakened Z√°polya's position. King of Hungary In 1526, the Ottoman Empire crushed the Hungarian royal army in the Battle of Moh√°cs and killed King Louis II. Z√°polya was en route to the battlefield with his sizable army but did not participate in the battle for unknown reasons. The Ottomans sacked the royal capital of Buda and occupied Syrmia, then withdrew from Hungary. The last three months of the year were marked by a power vacuum; political authority was in a state of collapse, yet the victors chose not to impose their rule. Two candidates stepped into the breach. One was Z√°polya, voivode of Transylvania and Hungary's most prominent aristocrat as well as commander of an intact army. The other was Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, the late king's brother-in-law and brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who claimed Hungary for the House of Habsburg. Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent returns the Holy Crown to John Z√°polya. The majority of Hungary's untitled lesser nobility (the gentry) backed Z√°polya, who for fifteen years had been playing a leading role in Hungarian political life. Part of the aristocracy acknowledged his leadership, and he enjoyed the enthusiastic support ‚Äî not always reciprocated ‚Äî of the lesser nobility. Most of his opponents succumbed at Moh√°cs: the Hungarian branch of the Jagiellon dynasty became defunct, and its pro-Habsburg following was decimated. The higher nobility of Hungary (the magnates or barons) sided with Ferdinand, and gathered in Pozsony for Ferdinand's election. The German dynasty's main argument ‚Äî one that many historians would judge to be decisive ‚Äî was that the Habsburg dynasty could help Hungary fight against the Ottomans. But in 1526, the promise rang empty. Hungary had been fighting the Ottomans for over a century, during which time the Empire and the Habsburgs had offered much encouragement but no tangible help. The likelihood of assistance was further reduced by the conflict of Ferdinand's older brother, Emperor Charles V, and King Francis I of France that once again flared into open war in the summer of 1526. This circumstance led the Voivode to discount the threat lurking behind the Habsburgs' candidacy: that Z√°polya's Hungary would have to contend not only with the Ottomans, but also with an attack from the west. Thus Z√°polya took no notice of his rival's protests, nor of those voiced by the few Hungarians who rallied to Ferdinand. On 10 November 1526, Z√°polya had himself proclaimed king by the Diet at Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, and he was duly crowned the next day. Ferdinand was also elected king by the magnates, barons, and the Catholic clergy in a rump Diet in Pozsony on 17 December 1526. Profiting from nine months of relative calm, John strove to restore state authority. He drew on his vast private wealth, the unconditional support of the lesser nobility, and the assistance of some aristocrats to impose his policies in domestic affairs. However, in the crucial sphere of foreign relations, success eluded him. He sought an entente with the Habsburgs, proposing to form an alliance against the Ottomans, but Ferdinand rejected all attempts at reconciliation. John's envoys fanned out across Europe in quest of support. Only in France did they find a positive response, but even that was ineffective since Francis was intent not on reconciling Hungary and the Habsburgs, but on drawing Hungary into a war against Charles and his family. Franco-Hungarian Treaty of alliance, 1529. Europe's political balance underwent a major shift in the summer of 1527, when, in a somewhat unplanned operation, mercenary forces of the emperor occupied Rome and drove Pope Clement VII, one of France's principal allies, to capitulate. This development freed Ferdinand ‚Äî who also acquired the Bohemian throne in late 1526 ‚Äì from the burden of assisting his brother. By then, Ferdinand had developed a Hungarian policy that was fully in keeping with the interests of his realms. He judged that if Hungary, unable to resist the Ottoman Empire, took action independently of Austria and Bohemia, it might well enter into an alliance with the Ottomans against its western neighbors. It was therefore in the interest of Austria and Bohemia that the Habsburgs gain control of Hungary, by force if necessary. In July 1527, Ferdinand sent an army of German mercenaries into Hungary. The moment was well chosen, for John Z√°polya's forces were tied up in the southern counties of Hungary, where Slavonic peasants, incited by Ferdinand, had rebelled; the revolt was led by the 'Black Man', Jovan Nenad. In one sweep, the pro-Habsburg soldiers captured Buda. John hurriedly redeployed his army, but on 27 September in the Battle of Tarcal (near Tokaj), he suffered a bloody defeat. Based on the earlier election of the Diet at Pozsony, Ferdinand was crowned in the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Basilica on 3 November 1527. In 1528 John fled Hungary for Poland, where he stayed with Prince Jan Amor Tarnowski.Zdzis≈Çaw Spieralski, Jan Tarnowski 1488-1561, Warszawa 1977, p. 124-125. In 1529 John approached the Ottomans, and agreed to make Hungary a vassal state in return for recognition and support. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent accepted, and sent Ottoman armies to invade Austria (which included the Siege of Vienna), a war which lasted till 1533. This allowed John to regain his position in Hungary in 1529, by the efforts of Frater George Martinuzzi, despite the association with the Ottomans which tainted him at the time. Martinuzzi became royal treasurer and John's most trusted minister. In 1533, the Ottomans made peace and ceded western Hungary to Ferdinand. Ferdinand now began to press John for control of the rest. In 1538, by the Treaty of Nagyv√°rad, John designated Ferdinand to be his successor after his death, as he was childless. However, in late January to early February 1539, he married Isabella Jagiellon, and in 15 July 1540 they had a son, John Sigismund. John died seven days later in 22 July 1540 in Sz√°szsebes (Sebe≈ü).

Biography  Son of Wawrzyniec, a steelworker and Marianna n√©e Chojkowska. He was born in the Ksawera working group between Bƒôdzin and DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza. Thanks to the relatively good material position of the family, he studied at the local elementary school. As a result of an accident suffered by his father, in 1913 he was forced to stop his education and take up a job. After the outbreak of the First World War, he left for agricultural work in Thuringia. He worked there until 1917, when he was arrested for hitting his overseer and sent to the prisoners of war camp in Erfurt. After escaping from there, he found himself in Upper Silesia, where he worked in a coal mine in Bytom and in the steelworks in Siemianowice ≈ölƒÖskie. After the outbreak of the revolution in November 1918 in Germany, he crossed the German-Polish border and settled in DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza, where in December 1918 he volunteered for the Polish Army. He took part in the battles in defense of Lviv, and then in war activities on the Lithuanian-Belarusian Front of the Polish-Bolshevik war. In 1921 he was demobilized as a non-commissioned officer of the Polish Army, after which he returned to DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza. For participating in the fighting in 1920, he was awarded the Cross of Valor. After returning from the war, he was initially unemployed, and then he worked at the coal mine \\"Paris\\" in DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza. There he also encountered the communist movement and joined the Young Communist League of Poland. In 1923 he became a member of the Communist Party of Poland. During this period he was wanted by state police for communist activities. He operated in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ District until 1924, after which he was sent to a party school in Moscow, where he stayed for several weeks. On July 9, 1925, he was arrested in Vilnius on charges of involvement in a murder of a supposed police informant. In December 1925, despite the lack of evidence for his involvement, he was sentenced to six years in prison. He served his sentence in Kielce, ≈Åom≈ºa and Drohobych. He left prison on March 2, 1932, and because of illness, was sent to the USSR for treatment. There he healed and taught at the party school of the WKP (b) and the OGPU near Moscow. He returned to Poland in 1934. On May 27, 1934, he was arrested in Warsaw. He was detained in custody until February 1935, when he was released on bail. On January 13, 1936, he was arrested again. He was then accused of acting to the detriment of the Republic of Poland. The trial took place on April 4-21, 1938. Along with Zawadzki, who was the main accused, 55 other people were tried. Zawadzki was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. After upholding the judgment of November 23, 1938 by the Court of Appeals, he was imprisoned in Brest. He stayed there until September 1939, when after the aggression of the USSR to Poland, the city was occupied by the Red Army. He took up work in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in the Pinsk district office. Aleksander Zawadzki was elected to the Sejm in 1947, and on 20 November 1952 he was appointed chairman of the Polish Council of State, to replace Boles≈Çaw Bierut. He died of cancer in 1964.

Background Born in Havana into an aristocratic family with old sugar plantations, he was the 5th child of Dr. Jos√© Mar√≠a de Zayas y Jim√©nez (1824‚Äì1887), a noted lawyer and educator, and Lutgarda Alfonso y Espada (1831‚Äì1898). He was brother to Dr. Juan Bruno de Zayas y Alfonso (1867‚Äì1896), a medical doctor and revolutionary hero who died in the war for Cuba's independence, and of Dr. Francisco de Zayas y Alfonso (1857‚Äì1924), Cuba's long-time Minister to Paris and Brussels. As one of the leaders of the Cuban insurrection of 1895, he ceased using the noble-sounding \\"de\\" in his name and became known simply as Alfredo Zayas. Besides his successful legal practice, he was active in Cuban literary circles and was co-editor of the journal \\"Cuba Literaria\\". During the last Cuban war for independence Zayas was an intellectual, not a military leader, and during the 1895-1898 Cuban war of independence, he was arrested and sent to prison in the African possession of Ceuta. When deported (September 20. 1896), while in transit in Spain's C√°rcel Modelo of Madrid, he wrote some of his best poetry, like \\"Al Caer la Nieve\\" Poemas alfredo zayas, poesia y mas... at www.geocities.com subsequently published in his Obras Completas, Vol. 1, Poesia. Zayas was sometimes referred to as the \\"erudite civilian president\\", because unlike his predecessor and his successor he did not have experience in the field of battle. Political career Upon his return to Cuba after the Spanish‚ÄìCuban‚ÄìAmerican War (known in the U.S. as Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War), he became acting mayor of Havana. He was a member of the Constitutional Convention 1901 and became its secretary. A vocal leader of the opposition against the U.S. annexation of Cuba, he voted against the Platt Amendment and against granting naval bases to the United States in Guant√°namo and Bahia Honda. Zayas became leader of the Liberal Party (left-wing) and was elected Vice-President 1908. In the contested, 1916 presidential election in which the populisthttps://web.archive.org/web/20040329183340/http://www.pinar.cu/municipios/consolacion/mem%20polit%20prerev.htm Liberal Party used violent tactics, he obtained more votes than the pro-U.S. candidate, Cornell graduate General Mario Garc√≠a Menocal. The Chambelona War ensued, which, after some reverses, was won by the Conservative Forces of Garcia Menocal with the covert support of the United States. Zayas surrendered in Cambute near Guanabacoa where it was said he was hiding.Noti-CUTC at webcutc.org The United States provided military support to Garc√≠a Menocal from Guant√°namo Naval Base, without formally invoking its right of intervention pursuant to the Platt Amendment, incorporated in the U.S.-Cuba Treaty of 1903. However, the United States only deployed forces in Oriente Province. Receiving the most votes again in 1920, Zayas was inaugurated as president in 1921. He served only one term, during which he started the process to give the vote to Cuban women (resolution in the Senate, 1921), negotiated the return of Cuban sovereignty over the Isle of Pines (Isla de la Juventud, 110.86 square kilometers) which had been occupied by the U.S. since 1898 (Hay-Quedada Treaty of 1925), obtained a $50 million USD loan from J.P. Morgan, and for the first time allowed full freedom of expression and of the press. On 10 October 1922 he launched PWX, the first Cuban radio station. Although his administration was systematically defamed by the opposition as corrupt, it actually was less corrupt than preceding and subsequent administrations, and Zayas refrained from censoring the press or arresting critics, unlike prior and later Cuban presidents. This brought him the nickname \\"el Chino\\" (the Chinaman), because of his stoicism (\\"la flema de Zayas\\") and his \\"oriental patience\\". Sometimes he was also nicknamed \\"pesetero\\", because since his imprisonment in Madrid he had always carried a Spanish Peseta coin in his vest pocket. When he took office in 1921, the country was in bankruptcy, with debts exceeding US$ 40 million, and sugar prices plummeting from 22 cents to 3 cents per pound. In spite of this, he carried out a number of reforms, particularly in the field of education. Family life In 1884, Zayas married Margarita Teresa Claudia del Carmen Arrieta y Diago and they had four children, Margarita (1886‚Äì1964), Alfredo (1888‚Äì1929), Francisco (1889‚Äì1934), and Maria-Teresa Zayas Arrieta (1892‚Äì1952). In 1914, he married a second time to Maria de la Asuncion Jaen y Planas. He had one other child out of wedlock, Alfredo Zayas y Mendez (1916- ). His great-grandson is the lawyer and historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas. Later life He did not run for reelection and devoted his last years to giving conferences and pursuing his manifold literary and historical interests, including the publication of his major work, the 2-volume \\"Lexicografia Antillana\\", which had seen an earlier edition in 1914, and occupying the post of President of the \\"Academia de la Historia\\" until his death. In the next election Gerardo Machado was elected, but turned dictatorial, and after a series of coups that followed when Machado was forced to step down Fulgencio Batista rose to power.

In particular, UNSC res 478 notes Israel's non-compliance with UNSC res 476 and condemned Israel's 1980 Jerusalem Law which declared Jerusalem to be Israel's \\"complete and united\\" capital, as a violation of international law. The resolution states that the Council will not recognize this law, and calls on member states to accept the decision of the council. This resolution also calls upon member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from the city. The resolution was passed with 14 votes to none against, with the United States abstaining. Reception and criticism Israel categorically rejected the resolution and its Foreign Ministry announced \\"It will not undermine the status of Jerusalem as the capital of a sovereign Israel and as a united city which will never again be torn apart\\". In remarks made to the Council, then-U.S. Secretary of State Edmund Muskie said \\"The question of Jerusalem must be addressed in the context of negotiations for a comprehensive, just and lasting Middle East peace.\\" With respect to the section of the draft resolution relating to the transfer of embassies from Jerusalem, the Secretary of State said that the resolution was \\"fundamentally flawed\\" and that the U.S. considered that the instruction that states remove their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem, \\"not binding\\" and \\"without force\\", and that \\"we reject it as a disruptive attempt to dictate to other nations.\\" He also said that the United States would forcefully resist any attempt to impose sanctions on Israel under Chapter VII of the Charter.Muskie was talking about the draft resolution before it was adopted. See S/PV.2245(OR) paragraph 106. Shlomo Slonim said that despite its forceful tone, Muskie's statement did not really elucidate the American position on Jerusalem. It made no reference to Jerusalem as an occupied territory, but neither did it deny such a status. He noted that America's policy regarding Jerusalem at the end of 1980 continued to be marked by a considerable degree of ambiguity and confusion. Decisions regarding illegal situations Two of the decisions contained in the resolution concerned the illegality of the Basic Law Jerusalem and violations of the Geneva Convention which are regarded as serious violations of customary international law.See for example S/PV.2245(OR) paragraph 19 and 77. The Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs is a legal publication, which analyzes and records the decisions of the UN organs.General Assembly resolution 686 (VII), \\"Ways And Means For Making The Evidence Of Customary International Law More Readily Available\\" mandated that a reportery of the practice of the UN organs be prepared by the Secretariat units concerned It states that the decisions were adopted by the Security Council acting on behalf of the members under Article 24.For example, The Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs, Article 24, Supplement No 6 (1979‚Äì1984), volume 3 indicates the Council was acting on behalf of the members when it formally declared illegal legislative and administrative measures invalid in resolution 478. See Note 2 on Page 1 and page listings on pages 12, 19, 24, 25, 26, 29, and 30 Although they were not adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter, the organization considers determinations regarding illegal situations to be binding upon all of its members.See Judge Higgins response to the question contained in General Assembly resolution ES-10/14 in her Separate Advisory Opinion, paras 22 and 38:; and De Waart, Paul J.

The RoHS 1 directive took effect on 1 July 2006, and is required to be enforced and became a law in each member state. This directive restricts (with exceptions) the use of ten hazardous materials in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. It is closely linked with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC (now supersededhttps://eur- lex.europa.eu/search.html?lang=en&text;=2002%2F96%2FEC&qid;=1575306757180&type;=quick&scope;=EURLEX&FM;_CODED=DIR) which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods and is part of a legislative initiative to solve the problem of huge amounts of toxic electronic waste. In speech, RoHS is often spelled out, or pronounced , , , or , and refers to the EU standard, unless otherwise qualified.  Details  Each European Union member state will adopt its own enforcement and implementation policies using the directive as a guide. RoHS is often referred to as the \\"lead-free directive,\\" but it restricts the use of the following ten substances: # Lead (Pb) # Mercury (Hg) # Cadmium (Cd) # Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) # Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) # Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) # Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) # Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) # Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) # Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP were added as part of DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/863 which was published on 31 March 2015. PBB and PBDE are flame retardants used in several plastics. Hexavalent chromium is used in chrome plating, chromate coatings and primers, and in chromic acid. The maximum permitted concentrations in non-exempt products are 0.1% or 1000 ppm (except for cadmium, which is limited to 0.01% or 100 ppm) by weight. The restrictions are on each homogeneous material in the product, which means that the limits do not apply to the weight of the finished product, or even to a component, but to any single material that could (theoretically) be separated mechanically ‚Äî for example, the sheath on a cable or the tinning on a component lead. As an example, a radio is composed of a case, screws, washers, a circuit board, speakers, etc. The screws, washers, and case may each be made of homogenous materials, but the other components comprise multiple sub-components of many different types of material. For instance, a circuit board is composed of a bare printed circuit board (PCB), integrated circuits (IC), resistors, capacitors, switches, etc. A switch is composed of a case, a lever, a spring, contacts, pins, etc., each of which may be made of different materials. A contact might be composed of a copper strip with a surface coating. A loudspeaker is composed of a permanent magnet, copper wire, paper, etc. Everything that can be identified as a homogeneous material must meet the limit. So if it turns out that the case was made of plastic with 2,300 ppm (0.23%) PBB used as a flame retardant, then the entire radio would fail the requirements of the directive. In an effort to close RoHS 1 loopholes, in May 2006 the European Commission was asked to review two currently excluded product categories (monitoring and control equipment, and medical devices) for future inclusion in the products that must fall into RoHS compliance. In addition the commission entertains requests for deadline extensions or for exclusions by substance categories, substance location or weight. New legislation was published in the official journal in July 2011 which supersedes this exemption. Note that batteries are not included within the scope of RoHS. However, in Europe, batteries are under the European Commission's 1991 Battery Directive (91/157/EEC), which was recently increased in scope and approved in the form of the new battery directive, version 2003/0282 COD, which will be official when submitted to and published in the EU's Official Journal. While the first Battery Directive addressed possible trade barrier issues brought about by disparate European member states' implementation, the new directive more explicitly highlights improving and protecting the environment from the negative effects of the waste contained in batteries. It also contains a programme for more ambitious recycling of industrial, automotive, and consumer batteries, gradually increasing the rate of manufacturer-provided collection sites to 45% by 2016. It also sets limits of 5 ppm mercury and 20 ppm cadmium to batteries except those used in medical, emergency, or portable power-tool devices. Though not setting quantitative limits on quantities of lead, lead‚Äìacid, nickel, and nickel‚Äìcadmium in batteries, it cites a need to restrict these substances and provide for recycling up to 75% of batteries with these substances. There are also provisions for marking the batteries with symbols in regard to metal content and recycling collection information. The directive applies to equipment as defined by a section of the WEEE directive. The following numeric categories apply: # Large household appliances # Small household appliances # IT & telecommunications equipment (although infrastructure equipment is exempt in some countries) # Consumer equipment # Lighting equipment ‚Äì including light bulbs # Electronic and electrical tools # Toys, leisure, and sports equipment # Medical devices (exemption removed in July 2011) # Monitoring and control instruments (exemption removed in July 2011) # Automatic dispensers # Semiconductor devices It does not apply to fixed industrial plant and tools. Compliance is the responsibility of the company that puts the product on the market, as defined in the Directive; components and sub-assemblies are not responsible for product compliance. Of course, given the fact that the regulation is applied at the homogeneous material level, data on substance concentrations needs to be transferred through the supply chain to the final producer. An IPC standard has recently been developed and published to facilitate this data exchange, IPC-1752. It is enabled through two PDF forms that are free to use. RoHS applies to these products in the EU whether made within the EU or imported. Certain exemptions apply, and these are updated on occasion by the EU. =Examples of product components containing restricted substances= RoHS restricted substances have been used in a broad array of consumer electronics products. Examples of components that have contained lead include: * paints and pigments * PVC (vinyl) cables as a stabiliser (e.g., power cords, USB cables) * solders * printed circuit board finishes, leads, internal and external interconnects * glass in television and photographic products (e.g., CRT television screens and camera lenses) * metal parts * lamps and bulbs * batteries * integrated circuits or microchips Cadmium is found in many of the components above; examples include plastic pigmentation, nickel‚Äìcadmium (NiCd) batteries and CdS photocells (used in night lights). Mercury is used in lighting applications and automotive switches; examples include fluorescent lamps and mercury tilt switches (these are rarely used nowadays). Hexavalent chromium is used for metal finishes to prevent corrosion. Polybrominated biphenyls and diphenyl ethers/oxides are used primarily as flame retardants. = Hazardous materials and the high-tech waste problem = RoHS and other efforts to reduce hazardous materials in electronics are motivated in part to address the global issue of consumer electronics waste. As newer technology arrives at an ever-increasing rate, consumers are discarding their obsolete products sooner than ever. This waste ends up in landfills and in countries like China to be \\"recycled.\\" > In the fashion-conscious mobile market, 98 million U.S. cell phones took > their last call in 2005. All told, the EPA estimates that in the U.S. that > year, between 1.5 and 1.9 million tons of computers, TVs, VCRs, monitors, > cell phones, and other equipment were discarded. If all sources of > electronic waste are tallied, it could total 50 million tons a year > worldwide, according to the UN Environment Programme. American electronics sent offshore to countries like Ghana in West Africa under the guise of recycling may be doing more harm than good. Not only are adult and child workers in these jobs being poisoned by heavy metals, but these metals are returning to the U.S. \\"The U.S. right now is shipping large quantities of leaded materials to China, and China is the world's major manufacturing center,\\" Dr. Jeffrey Weidenhamer says, a chemistry professor at Ashland University in Ohio. \\"It's not all that surprising things are coming full circle and now we're getting contaminated products back.\\" = Changing toxicity perceptions = In addition to the high-tech waste problem, RoHS reflects contemporary research over the past 50 years in biological toxicology that acknowledges the long-term effects of low-level chemical exposure on populations. New testing is capable of detecting much smaller concentrations of environmental toxicants. Researchers are associating these exposures with neurological, developmental, and reproductive changes. RoHS and other environmental laws are in contrast to historical and contemporary law that seek to address only acute toxicology, that is direct exposure to large amounts of toxic substances causing severe injury or death. = Life-cycle impact assessment of lead-free solder = The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the environmental impacts of lead-free and tin‚Äìlead solder, as used in electronic products. For bar solders, when only lead-free solders were considered, the tin/copper alternative had the lowest (best) scores. For paste solders, bismuth/tin/silver had the lowest impact scores among the lead-free alternatives in every category except non-renewable resource consumption. For both paste and bar solders, all of the lead-free solder alternatives had a lower (better) LCA score in toxicity categories than tin/lead solder. This is primarily due to the toxicity of lead, and the amount of lead that leaches from printed wiring board assemblies, as determined by the leachability study conducted by the partnership. The study results are providing the industry with an objective analysis of the life-cycle environmental effects of leading candidate alternative lead-free solders, allowing industry to consider environmental concerns along with the traditionally evaluated parameters of cost and performance. This assessment is also allowing industry to redirect efforts toward products and processes that reduce solders' environmental footprint, including energy consumption, releases of toxic chemicals, and potential risks to human health and the environment. Another life-cycle assessment by IKP, University of Stuttgart, shows similar results to those of the EPA study. =Life-cycle impact assessment of BFR-free plastics= The ban on concentrations of brominated flame retardants (BFR) above 0.1% in plastics has affected plastics recycling. As more and more products include recycled plastics, it has become critical to know the BFR concentration in these plastics, either by tracing the origins of the recycled plastics to establish the BFR concentrations, or by measuring the BFR concentrations from samples. Plastics with high BFR concentrations are costly to handle or to discard, whereas plastics with levels below 0.1% have value as recyclable materials. There are a number of analytical techniques for the rapid measurement of BFR concentrations. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy can confirm the presence of bromine (Br), but it does not indicate the BFR concentration or specific molecule. Ion attachment mass spectrometry (IAMS) can be used to measure BFR concentrations in plastics. The BFR ban has significantly affected both upstream (plastic material selection) and downstream (plastic material recycling). = 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2) = The RoHS 2 directive (2011/65/EU) is an evolution of the original directive and became law on 21 July 2011 and took effect on 2 January 2013. It addresses the same substances as the original directive while improving regulatory conditions and legal clarity. It requires periodic re-evaluations that facilitate gradual broadening of its requirements to cover additional electronic and electrical equipment, cables and spare parts. The CE logo now indicates compliance and RoHS 2 declaration of conformity is now detailed (see below). In 2012, a final report from the European Commission revealed that some EU Member States considered all toys under the scope of the primary RoHS 1 Directive 2002/95/EC, irrespective of whether their primary or secondary functions were using electric currents or electromagnetic fields. From the implementation of RoHS 2 or RoHS Recast Directive 2011/65/EU on, all the concerned Member States will have to comply with the new regulation. The key difference in the recast is that it is now necessary to demonstrate conformity in a similar way to the LVD and EMC directives. Not being able to show compliance in sufficiently detailed files, and not ensuring it is implemented in production is now a criminal offence. Like the other CE marking directives it mandates production control and traceability to the technical files. It describes 2 methods of achieving presumption of conformity (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 16.2), either technical files should include test data for all materials or a standard accepted in the official journal for the directive, is used. Currently the only standard is IEC 63000:2016 (IEC 63000:2016 superseded EN 50581:2012), a risk based method to reduce the amount of test data required (Harmonised Standards list for RoHS2, OJEU C363/6). One of the consequences of the requirement to demonstrate conformity is the requirement to know the exemption use of each component, otherwise it is not possible to know compliance when the product is placed on the market, the only point in time the product must be 'compliant'. Many do not understand that 'compliance' varies depending on what exemptions are in force and it is quite possible to make a non-compliant product with 'compliant' components. Compliance must be calculated on the day of placing on the market. In reality this means knowing the exemption status of all components and using up stock of old status parts before the expire date of the exemptions (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 7.b referring to Decision 768/2008/EC Module A Internal production control). Not having a system to manage this could be seen as a lack of diligence and a criminal prosecution could occur (UK Instrument 2012 N. 3032 section 39 Penalties). RoHS 2 also has a more dynamic approach to exemptions, creating an automatic expiration if exemptions are not renewed by requests from industry. Additionally new substances can be added to the controlled list, with 4 new substances expected to be controlled by 2019. All these mean greater information control and update systems are required. Other differences include new responsibilities for importers and distributors and markings to improve traceability to the technical files. These are part of the NLF for directives and make the supply chain a more active part of the policing (Directive 2011/65/EU Articles 7, 9, 10). There has been a recent additional amendment 2017/2102 to 2011/65 = 2015/863 (RoHS 2 amendment) = The RoHS 2 directive (2011/65/EU) contains allowance to add new materials and 4 materials are highlighted for this attention in the original version, the amendment 2015/863 adds four additional substances to Annex II of 2011/65/EU (3/4 of the new restrictions are recommended for investigation in the original directive, ref Para 10 of preamble). This is another reason that simple component RoHS compliance statements are not acceptable as compliance requirements vary depending on the date the product is placed on the market (ref IEC 63000:2016). The additional four substances restriction and evidence requirements shall be applied for products placed on the market on or after 22 July 2019 except where exemptions permit as stated in Annex III., although at the time of writing no exemptions exist or have been applied for, for these materials. The four additional substances are # Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) # Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) # Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) # Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) The maximum permitted concentrations in non-exempt products are 0.1%. The new substances are also listed under the Reach Candidate list, and DEHP is not authorised for manufacturing (use as a substance) in the EU under annexe XIV of Reach. Scope exclusions With the recast of the original RoHS (I) Directive (2002/95/EC), the scope of the directive was decoupled from the scope of the WEEE Directive and an open scope was introduced. The RoHS (II) Directive (2011/65/EU) was applicable to all electrical and electronic equipment. Scope limitations and exclusions were specifically introduced in Article 2(4) a) ‚Äì j) of the recast Directive. All other EEE was in scope of the Directive, unless specific exemptions have been granted through Commission delegated acts (see next paragraph). The scope exclusions are listed below This Directive does not apply to: 1. equipment which is necessary for the protection of the essential interests of the security of Member States, including arms, munitions and war material intended for specifically military purposes; 2. equipment designed to be sent into space; 3. equipment which is specifically designed, and is to be installed, as part of another type of equipment that is excluded or does not fall within the scope of this Directive, which can fulfil its function only if it is part of that equipment, and which can be replaced only by the same specifically designed equipment; 4. large-scale stationary industrial tools; 5. large-scale fixed installations; 6. means of transport for persons or goods, excluding electric two-wheel vehicles which are not type-approved; 7. non-road mobile machinery made available exclusively for professional use; 8. active implantable medical devices; 9. photovoltaic panels intended to be used in a system that is designed, assembled and installed by professionals for permanent use at a defined location to produce energy from solar light for public, commercial, industrial and residential applications; 10. equipment specifically designed solely for the purposes of research and development only made available on a business-to-business basis. Restriction exemptions There are over 80 exemptions, some of which are quite broad. Exemptions will automatically expire after 5 or 7 years unless renewed. According to Hewlett Packard: \\"The European Union is gradually narrowing the scope of and expiring many of the current RoHS exemptions. In addition, it is likely that new substance restrictions will be introduced in the next several years.\\" Some exemptions: * Lead as an alloying element in steel containing up to 0.35% lead by weight, aluminium containing up to 0.4% lead by weight, and copper alloy containing up to 4% lead by weight is permitted. (Category 6c) * Lead in high melting temperature type solders (i.e. lead-based solder alloys containing 85% or more lead by weight). (Category 7a) * \\"Lead in solders for servers, storage and storage array systems, network infrastructure equipment for switching, transmission, and network management for telecommunications.\\" (Category 7b) * Limited amounts of mercury in fluorescent and other light bulbs where it is essential to their functioning comprise RoHS 2 Categories 1, 2, 3, and 4 Medical devices were exempt in the original directive. RoHS 2 narrowed the exemption's scope to active implantable medical devices only (Category 4h). In vitro diagnostic devices (IVDD) and other medical devices are now included. Automotive vehicles are exempt (Category 4f). Vehicles instead are addressed in the End of Life Vehicles Directive (Directive 2000/53/EC).  Labeling and documentation  The CE logo Products within scope of the RoHS 2 directive must display the CE mark, the manufacturers name and address and a serial or batch number. Parties needing to know more detailed compliance information can find this on the EU Declaration of Conformity for the product as created by the manufacturer (Brand owner) responsible for the design or the EU representative. The regulation also requires most actors in the supply chain for the product (importer and distributors) to keep and check this document, as well as ensuring a conformance process has been followed and the correct language translation for instructions are provided. The manufacturer must keep certain documentation to demonstrate conformity, known as a technical file or technical records. The directive requires the manufacturer to demonstrate conformity by the use of test data for all materials or by following a harmonised standard (IEC 63000:2016 is the only standard at the time of writing). Regulators may request this file or, more likely, specific data from it as it will likely be very large.2011/65/EU Article 16.2 = History = A RoHS mark RoHS did not require any specific product labelling, but many manufacturers have adopted their own compliance marks to reduce confusion. Visual indicators have included explicit \\"RoHS compliant\\" labels, green leaves, check marks, and \\"PB-Free\\" markings. Chinese RoHS labels, a lower case \\"e\\" within a circle with arrows, can also imply compliance. The WEEE directive logo RoHS 2 attempts to address this issue by requiring the aforementioned CE mark whose use is policed by the Trading Standards enforcement agency. It states that the only permitted indication of RoHS compliance is the CE mark. The closely related WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive), which became law simultaneously with RoHS, depicts a waste-can logo with an \\"X\\" through it and often accompanies the CE mark. Future possible additions New substance restrictions being considered for introduction in the next few years include phthalates, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), chlorinated flame retardants (CFRs), and PVC. Other regions =Asia / Pacific= ;China Order No. 39: Final Measures for the Administration of the Control and Electronic Information Products (often referred to as China RoHS) has the stated intent to establish similar restrictions, but in fact takes a very different approach. Unlike EU RoHS, where products in specified categories are included unless specifically excluded, there will be a list of included products, known as the catalogue ‚Äì see Article 18 of the regulation ‚Äì which will be a subset of the total scope of Electronic Information Products, or EIPs, to which the regulations apply. Initially, products that fall under the covered scope must provide markings and disclosure as to the presence of certain substances, while the substances themselves are not (yet) prohibited. There are some products that are EIPs, which are not in scope for EU RoHS, e.g. radar systems, semiconductor- manufacturing equipment, photomasks, etc. The list of EIPs is available in Chinese and English. The marking and disclosure aspects of the regulation were intended to take effect on 1 July 2006, but were postponed twice to 1 March 2007. There is no timeline for the catalogue yet. ;Japan: Japan does not have any direct legislation dealing with the RoHS substances, but its recycling laws have spurred Japanese manufacturers to move to a lead-free process in accordance with RoHS guidelines. A ministerial ordinance Japanese industrial standard for Marking of Specific Chemical Substances (J-MOSS), effective from 1 July 2006, directs that some electronic products exceeding a specified amount of the nominated toxic substances must carry a warning label. ;South Korea: South Korea promulgated the Act for Resource Recycling of Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Vehicles on 2 April 2007. This regulation has aspects of RoHS, WEEE, and ELV. ;Turkey: Turkey announced the implementation of their Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) legislation effective June 2009. =North America= The Consumer Product Safety Act was enacted in 1972 followed by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act in 2008. California has passed the Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003 (EWRA). This law prohibits the sale of electronic devices after 1 January 2007, that are prohibited from being sold under the EU RoHS directive, but across a much narrower scope that includes LCDs, CRTs, and the like and only covers the four heavy metals restricted by RoHS. EWRA also has a restricted material disclosure requirement. Effective 1 January 2010, the California Lighting Efficiency and Toxics Reduction Act applies RoHS to general purpose lights, i.e. \\"lamps, bulbs, tubes, or other electric devices that provide functional illumination for indoor residential, indoor commercial, and outdoor use.\\" Other US states and cities are debating whether to adopt similar laws, and there are several states that have mercury and PBDE bans already. =Ireland= Worldwide standards and certification are available under the QC 080000 standard, governed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, to ensure the control of hazardous substances in industrial applications. =Sweden= In 2012 Sweden's Chemicals Agency (Kemi) and Electrical Safety Authority tested 63 consumer electronics products and found that 12 were out of compliance. Kemi claims that this is similar to testing results from prior years. \\"Eleven products contained prohibited levels of lead, and one of polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants. Details of seven companies have been passed to Swedish prosecutors. Kemi says that levels of non- compliance with RoHS are similar to previous years, and remain too high.\\"  Other standards  RoHS is not the only environmental standard of which electronic product developers should be aware. Manufacturers will find that it is cheaper to have only a single bill of materials for a product that is distributed worldwide, instead of customising the product to fit each country's specific environmental laws. Therefore, they develop their own standards, which allow only the strictest of all allowable substances. For example, IBM forces each of their suppliers to complete a Product Content Declaration form to document compliance to their environmental standard 'Baseline Environmental Requirements for Materials, Parts and Products for IBM Logo Hardware Products'. Thus, IBM banned DecaBDE, even though there was formerly a RoHS exemption for this material (overturned by the European Court in 2008). Similarly, here is Hewlett-Packard's environmental standard.  Criticism  Adverse effects on product quality and reliability, plus high cost of compliance (especially to small business) are cited as criticisms of the directive, as well as early research indicating that the life cycle benefits of lead-free solder versus traditional solder materials are mixed. Criticism earlier on came from an industry resistant to change and a misunderstanding of solders and soldering processes. Deliberate misinformation was espoused to resist what was perceived as a \\"non-tariff barrier created by European bureaucrats.\\" Many believe the industry is stronger now through this experience and has a better understanding of the science and technologies involved. One criticism of RoHS is that the restriction of lead and cadmium does not address some of their most prolific applications, while being costly for the electronics industry to comply with . Specifically, the total lead used in electronics makes up only 2% of world lead consumption, while 90% of lead is used for batteries (covered by the battery directive, as mentioned above, which requires recycling and limits the use of mercury and cadmium, but does not restrict lead). Another criticism is that less than 4% of lead in landfills is due to electronic components or circuit boards, while approximately 36% is due to leaded glass in cathode ray tube monitors and televisions, which can contain up to 2 kg per screen.This study was done right after the tech boom. The more common lead-free solder systems have a higher melting point, e.g. a 30 ¬∞C typical difference for tin-silver-copper alloys, but wave soldering temperatures are approximately the same at ~255 ¬∞C; however at this temperature most typical lead-free solders have longer wetting times than eutectic Pb/Sn 37:63 solder. Additionally wetting force is typically lower, which can be disadvantageous (for hole filling), but advantageous in other situations (closely spaced components). Care must be taken in selection of RoHS solders as some formulations are harder with less ductility, increasing the likelihood of cracks instead of plastic deformation, which is typical for lead-containing solders. Cracks can occur due to thermal or mechanical forces acting on components or the circuit board, the former being more common during manufacturing and the latter in the field. RoHS solders exhibit advantages and disadvantages in these respects, dependent on packaging and formulation. The editor of Conformity Magazine wondered in 2005 if the transition to lead-free solder would affect long-term reliability of electronic devices and systems, especially in applications more mission- critical than in consumer products, citing possible breaches due to other environmental factors like oxidation. The 2005 Farnell/Newark InOne \\"RoHS Legislation and Technical Manual\\", cites these and other \\"lead-free\\" solder issues, such as: # Warping or delamination of printed circuit boards; # Damage to through-holes, ICs and components on circuit boards; and, # Added moisture sensitivity, all of which may compromise quality and reliability. = Effect on reliability = Potential reliability concerns were addressed in Annex item #7 of the RoHS directive, granting some specific exemptions from regulation until 2010. These issues were raised when the directive was first implemented in 2003 and reliability effects were less known. Another potential problem that some lead-free, high tin-based solders may face is the growth of tin whiskers. These thin strands of tin can grow and make contact with an adjacent trace, developing a short circuit. Historically tin whiskers have been associated with a handful of failures, including a nuclear power plant shutdown and pacemaker incident where pure tin plating was used. However, these failures pre-date RoHS. They also do not involve consumer electronics, and therefore may employ RoHS-restricted substances if desired. To help mitigate potential problems, lead-free manufacturers are using a variety of approaches such as tin-zinc formulations that produce non-conducting whiskers or formulations that reduce growth, although they do not halt growth completely in all circumstances. Fortunately, experience thus far suggests deployed instances of RoHS compliant products are not failing due to whisker growth. Dr. Ronald Lasky of Dartmouth College reports: \\"RoHS has been in force for more than 15 months now, and ~$400B RoHS-compliant products have been produced. With all of these products in the field, no significant numbers of tin whisker-related failures have been reported.\\" Whisker growth occurs slowly over time, is unpredictable, and not fully understood, so time may be the only true test of these efforts. Whisker growth is even observable for lead-based solders, albeit on a much smaller scale. Some countries have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure products from the legislation. However, this may be a moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as Quad Flat Packages (QFP), Small Outline Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and Small outline packages (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as Ball grid arrays (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes. = Economic effect = There are no de minimis exemptions, e.g., for micro-businesses. This economic effect was anticipated and at least some attempts at mitigating the effect were made. Another form of economic effect is the cost of product failures during the switch to RoHS compliance. For example, tin whiskers were responsible for a 5% failure rate in certain components of Swiss Swatch watches in 2006, prior to the July implementation of RoHS, reportedly triggering a US$1 billion recall. Swatch responded to this by applying for an exemption to RoHS compliance, but this was denied.  Benefits  =Health benefits= RoHS helps reduce damage to people and the environment in third- world countries where much of today's \\"high-tech waste\\" ends up. The use of lead-free solders and components reduces risks to electronics industry workers in prototype and manufacturing operations. Contact with solder paste no longer represents the same health hazard as it used to. =Reliability concerns unfounded= Contrary to the predictions of widespread component failure and reduced reliability, RoHS's first anniversary (July 2007) passed with little fanfare. Most contemporary consumer electronics are RoHS compliant. As of 2013, millions of compliant products are in use worldwide. Many electronics companies keep \\"RoHS status\\" pages on their corporate websites. For example, the AMD website states: > Although lead containing solder cannot be completely eliminated from all > applications today, AMD engineers have developed effective technical > solutions to reduce lead content in microprocessors and chipsets to ensure > RoHS compliance while minimizing costs and maintaining product features. > There is no change to fit, functional, electrical or performance > specifications. Quality and reliability standards for RoHS compliant > products are expected to be identical compared to current packages. RoHS printed circuit board finishing technologies are surpassing traditional formulations in fabrication thermal shock, solder paste printability, contact resistance, and aluminium wire bonding performance and nearing their performance in other attributes. The properties of lead-free solder, such as its high temperature resilience, has been used to prevent failures under harsh field conditions. These conditions include operating temperatures with test cycles in the range of ‚àí40 ¬∞C to +150 ¬∞C with severe vibration and shock requirements. Automobile manufacturers are turning to RoHS solutions now as electronics move into the engine bay. =Flow properties and assembly= One of the major differences between lead-containing and lead-free solder pastes is the \\"flow\\" of the solder in its liquid state. Lead-containing solder has a lower surface tension, and tends to move slightly to attach itself to exposed metal surfaces that touch any part of the liquid solder. Lead-free solder conversely tends to stay in place where it is in its liquid state, and attaches itself to exposed metal surfaces only where the liquid solder touches it. This lack of \\"flow\\" ‚Äì while typically seen as a disadvantage because it can lead to lower quality electrical connections ‚Äì can be used to place components more tightly than they used to be placed due to the properties of lead-containing solders. For example, Motorola reports that their new RoHS wireless device assembly techniques are \\"...enabling a smaller, thinner, lighter unit.\\" Their Motorola Q phone would not have been possible without the new solder. The lead-free solder allows for tighter pad spacing. =Some exempt products achieve compliance= Research into new alloys and technologies is allowing companies to release RoHS products that are currently exempt from compliance, e.g. computer servers. IBM has announced a RoHS solution for high lead solder joints once thought to remain a permanent exemption. The lead-free packaging technology \\"...offers economical advantages in relation to traditional bumping processes, such as solder waste reduction, use of bulk alloys, quicker time-to-market for products and a much lower chemical usage rate.\\" Test and measurement vendors, such as National Instruments, have also started to produce RoHS-compliant products, despite devices in this category being exempt from the RoHS directive.

He served as the seventh commandant of the United States Marine Corps, from 1864 to 1876. Early life and education Zeilin was born in Philadelphia on July 16, 1806. He attended the United States Military Academy from 1822 to 1825, but dropped out due to poor grades in philosophy and chemistry. Career Zeilin was commissioned in the Marine Corps as a second lieutenant on October 1, 1831. After completing the preliminary training of a Marine officer in Washington, D.C., Zeilin's first tours of duty were ashore at the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia, and at Gosport, Virginia. He first went to sea on board the sloop of war in March 1832, which was followed by a tour of duty at Charlestown (Boston), Massachusetts. In August 1834, he again joined the sloop Erie on a long and eventful voyage which lasted for more than three years. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 12 September 1836. From September 1837 to April 1841, Zeilin again served at Charlestown, Massachusetts, and New York. In February 1842, he returned to sea duty, on board the , and during the cruise that followed spent several months on the Brazil station. Upon the conclusion of this tour of sea duty, and after again serving at important Marine Corps stations on the east coast of the United States from 1842 to 1845, he was transferred to duty aboard the frigate of the U.S. Pacific Squadron. =Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War= During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Zeilin commanded the Marine Detachment embarked in Congress, which ship was attached to Commodore Robert F. Stockton's force. He took part in the conquest of California (1846‚Äì1847) and was brevetted to the rank of major (two grades above his rank at the time) for gallantry during the action at the San Gabriel River crossing on January 9, 1847. Later, he took part in the capture of Los Angeles and in the Battle of La Mesa. On 28 January 1847, Zeilin was appointed Military Commandant of San Diego and served in that capacity until the completion of the conquest of California. He was promoted to the regular rank of captain on 14 September 1847. During the following few months, Zeilin, with the Marines of the Pacific Squadron, participated in the capture of important ports in lower California and the west coast of Mexico, and served as Fleet Marine Officer of the Pacific Squadron. In September 1847, he served with the forces that captured Guaymas and those that met the enemy at San Jose on the 30th. For the remainder of the war, Mazatl√°n was his center of activity, and he fought in several skirmishes with the Mexicans in that area. =Interwar period= After the close of the war with Mexico, Zeilin proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, where he served for a time, then to New York. He remained at New York until June 1852. He was selected to accompany Commodore Matthew C. Perry as Fleet Marine Officer in the famous expedition to Japan, serving with the Marine Detachment in in which he cruised to Japan with the expedition. With elaborate ceremonies, the Marines under his command took a prominent part in the expedition. He was the second person to set foot on shore at the formal landing of the naval forces at Kurihama, Yokosuka, Japan on 14 July 1853, and was one of those later accorded special honor for his part in the expedition that opened the doors of Japan to the outside world. Upon his return from Japan, he was again stationed at Norfolk. This duty was followed by his being placed in command of the Marine Barracks of the Washington Navy Yard. After remaining for a time at Washington, he again went to sea, this time aboard the frigate , on the European Station, until 1859. =American Civil War= During the early part of the American Civil War, Zeilin was on garrison duty in command of Marine Barracks, firstly at Philadelphia and later at Washington, D.C. Five days later, he was appointed to the regular rank of major. On July 21, 1861, he commanded a company of U.S. Marines during the First Battle of Bull Run and received a slight wound. In 1863, Zeilin was given command of the battalion of U.S. Marines sent to support the naval force whose mission was the capture of Charleston, South Carolina, but, because of illness, he returned after a few weeks of this duty to garrison duty at Marine Barracks, Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Later, he returned to sea, serving with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral John Dahlgren. In 1864, Zeilin assumed command of the Marine Barracks at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. =Commandant of the Marine Corps= On June 10, 1864, he was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Marine Corps in the rank of colonel. His faithful and efficient performance of the duties of Commandant of the Marine Corps during the trying period of the last year of the war and those years immediately following the close of the war is evidenced by the fact that he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on 2 March 1867. Upon his promotion, he became the Marine Corps' first general officer. After the war, Brigadier General Zeilin successfully defended the Marine Corps against its critics. In 1868, Zeilin approved of the design of the \\"Eagle, Globe, and Anchor,\\" as the emblem for the Marine Corps. It replaced the previous emblem which was a bugle with a letter \\"M\\" in the middle. Zeilin retired from the Marine Corps on November 1, 1876 after serving over forty-five years as a Marine Corps officer. When considering his time at West Point, he served over 49 years in uniform. Personal life Jacob Zeilin Memorial in Laurel Hill Cemetery Zeilin married Virginia Freeman on October 22, 1845. Together they had one son, William Freeman Zeilin (1851-1880) and two daughters, Margaret Freeman Very (1850-1911) (wife of Edward Wilson Very) and Anne V. Stockton (wife of one of Senator John P. Stockton's sons). General Zeilin was a member of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society of officers who served in the Union armed forces. On 18 November 1880, he died in Washington, D.C. He is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Sports Journalism started in the early 1800s when it was targeted to the social elite and has transitioned into an integral part of the news business with newspapers having dedicated sports sections. The increased popularity of sports amongst the middle and lower class led to the more coverage of sports content in publications. The appetite for sports resulted in sports only publications like ESPN and Sports Illustrated. There are many different forms of sports journalism, ranging from play by play and game recaps to analysis and investigative journalism on important developments in the sport. Technology and the internet age has massively changed the sports journalism space as it is struggling with the same problems that the broader category of print journalism is struggling with, mainly not being able to cover costs due to falling subscriptions. New forms of internet blogging and tweeting in the current millennium have pushed the boundaries of sports journalism.  Early history  Modern sports journalism finds its roots as content started to appear in newspapers in the early 1800s. At the start, the sports sporadically covered horse racing and boxing. The focus of the coverage would be less on the event itself and more on the greater social context. Horse races between the North and South and boxing bouts between US and England garnered much interest from the social elite. During the 1820s and 30s, the primary demographic target for newspapers was the social elite as newspaper was too expensive for the common man. Approaching the 20th century, several important changes occurred that lead to the increased saturation of sports journalism in the mainstream. The first was the advent of the penny press which allowed for cheaper and more tabloid style of newspaper production. Newspapers also began using advertising to pay for their production costs instead of relying on circulation. These two factors lead to a change in the target demographic from social elite upper class to the lower- middle class. Simultaneously, the Industrial Revolution was creating a rapidly expanding middle class who were moving from the country side to booming urban developments. The change in the target demographic meant that newspaper publishers were looking for content that appealed to the masses so they turned to sports. These developments also coincided with the rising popularity of baseball which was rapidly becoming \\"America's Pastime\\".  20th century  The New York Herald was the first newspapers to publishing consistent sports coverage. The New York World in 1883 was the first newspaper to have a full times sports department. The following period from 1880-1920 saw a massive increase in sports coverage in publications. A study showed that in 1880 only .4 percent of space in the newspaper was dedicated to sports. By the 1920s, that proportion had risen to 20 percent. During this time, newspapers focused mainly on play by play coverage and game recaps of the sport events. Local publications started hiring beat reporters who were tasked with following all developments pertaining to the team. This included traveling with the team and interviewing the players. Teams also started constructing dedicated sections called press box in the stadiums for the press to sit and record notes on the game. As technology introduced new developments like the radio, television and the internet, the focus of sports coverage shifted from the play by play to statistical analysis of the game and background pieces on the players. This was also coupled with a massive increase in sports amongst the general public. The increased popularity of football, basketball and hockey meant more content to publish and more interested readers to publish to. This led to the creation of journals like Sports Illustrated, first published in 1954, was one of the first publications to solely focus on sports. Sports Illustrated was the brainchild of Henry Lucre who felt that the established publishers at the time were not taking advantage of the public's massive appetite for sports. With weekly issues, Sports Illustrated was able to produce more classic journalistic pieces as the writers had more time to research and conduct longer interview sit downs with players and coaches.  Digital Age  Since the start of the new millennium, circulation and advertising numbers of print newspapers having been falling rapidly. This has led to widespread cost cutting and layoffs across the industry. There are 29% percent fewer journalist in the workforce now when compared to the number of journalist in 1980. These developments have significantly affected sports journalism as established publications like Sports Illustrated and ESPN have had to cut content, increase prices and reduce the number of publications which leads to more people unsubscribing from the content. The fall in print sports journalism can be tied to the rise of internet and digital sports journalism. Digital sports journalism serves as both a complement and a competitor of newspaper sports journalism. Digital sports journalism began in the mid 1990s with ESPN creating the first website in 1995. At first digital sports journalism covered broad topics in scope, but as time went on and the internet became more widespread, bloggers and location and team specific websites started taking over the market. A majority of these smaller websites did not charge a subscription fee as it was funded on advertising. This lower cost to the consumer as well as increased access to variety of very specific content led to the shift away from print and towards digital. However, the growth seen in the digital space which has increased advertising revenue has not balanced out the losses from print journalism. The importance of click count has gone up as these sites are being funded by online advertisers. This has led to many shorter journalistic pieces offering controversial opinions in order to generate the most clicks. Sportswriters regularly face more deadline pressure than other reporters because sporting events tend to occur late in the day and closer to the deadlines many organizations must observe. Yet they are expected to use the same tools as news journalists, and to uphold the same professional and ethical standards. They must take care not to show bias for any team.  Socio-political significance  Sports stories occasionally transcend the games themselves and take on socio-political significance: Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball is an example of this. Modern controversies regarding the hyper-compensation of top athletes, the use of anabolic steroids and other, banned performance-enhancing drugs, and the cost to local and national governments to build sports venues and related infrastructure, especially for Olympic Games, also demonstrates how sports can intrude on to the news pages. Recently, the issue of Colin Kaepernick's protest of injustice shown to people of color by the police by kneeling during the performance of the national anthem before his football games has created diverse and varied coverage. His actions have taken his discussion from the sports field and into the national scope as major political pundits and even the Presidents commenting on the ethics of his actions. Kaepernick cites that his position as a quarterback in the National Football League gives him a unique opportunity to carry out his message. Kaepernick's actions have inspired a wave of athletes using their position to take on social issues ranging from abortion to college athletes getting monetary compensation. Sports journalism plays a significant role in how these views are conveyed to the public. The author creates a story from the raw quotes provided by the athlete and this is published to thousands of viewers. Inherent in the publication will be the biases of the author and this will be passed on to the reader (cite). As sports moves more and more into the political discussion space, sports journalist will have increasingly more power over the public sentiment of the hottest issues at the moment.  Future of sports journalism  There has been a major shift within sports in the last decade as more sports teams are switching to using analytics. A large reason for this shift is due to many articles being published about the increased benefit of using analytics to make strategic decisions in a game. As there is data collected about every instance in every sport, sports data analysis has increased. Sports publications are now hiring people with extensive background in statistics and mathematics in order to publish articles detailing the analysis these teams are conducting. New metrics have been created to study the quality of player performance. The metrics have also been used to compile rankings of players and teams. Blog sites like FiveThirtyEight began to sprout as full- time sport analytic sites that took available data and constructed analytic heavy articles pertaining to sports. ESPN has implemented a segment in their shows called ‚ÄòSports Science‚Äô where stars of every sport come in to test how advanced analytics affect field performance. There has been much pushback by many over the use of analytics in sports. Many established coaches are quick to bash analytics as narrow and ignorant of the big picture.  In Europe  The tradition of sports reporting attracting some of the finest writers in journalism can be traced to the coverage of sport in Victorian England, where several modern sports ‚Äì such as association football, cricket, athletics and rugby ‚Äì were first organized and codified into something resembling what we would recognize today. Andrew Warwick has suggested that The Boat Race provided the first mass spectator event for journalistic coverage. The Race, an annual rowing event between the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford, has been held annually from 1856. Cricket, possibly because of its esteemed place in society, has regularly attracted the most elegant of writers. The Manchester Guardian, in the first half of the 20th century, employed Neville Cardus as its cricket correspondent as well as its music critic. Cardus was later knighted for his services to journalism. One of his successors, John Arlott, who became a worldwide favorite because of his radio commentaries on the BBC, was also known for his poetry. The first London Olympic Games in 1908 attracted such widespread public interest that many newspapers assigned their very best-known writers to the event. The Daily Mail even had Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at the White City Stadium to cover the finish of the Marathon. Such was the drama of that race, in which Dorando Pietri collapsed within sight of the finishing line when leading, that Conan Doyle led a public subscription campaign to see the gallant Italian, having been denied the gold medal through his disqualification, awarded a special silver cup, which was presented by Queen Alexandra. And the public imagination was so well caught by the event that annual races in Boston, Massachusetts, and London, and at future Olympics, were henceforward staged over exactly the same, 26-mile, 385-yard distance used for the 1908 Olympic Marathon, and the official length of the event worldwide to this day. The London race, called the Polytechnic Marathon and originally staged over the 1908 Olympic route from outside the royal residence at Windsor Castle to White City, was first sponsored by the Sporting Life, which in those Edwardian times was a daily newspaper which sought to cover all sporting events, rather than just a betting paper for horse racing and greyhounds that it became in the years after the Second World War. The rise of the radio made sports journalism more focused on the live coverage of the sporting events. The first sports reporter in Great Britain, and one of the first sports reporters in the World, was an English writer Edgar Wallace, who made a report on The Derby on June 6, 1923 for the British Broadcasting Company. In France, L'Auto, the predecessor of L'Equipe, had already played an equally influential part in the sporting fabric of society when it announced in 1903 that it would stage an annual bicycle race around the country. The Tour de France was born, and sports journalism's role in its foundation is still reflected today in the leading rider wearing a yellow jersey - the color of the paper on which L'Auto was published (in Italy, the Giro d'Italia established a similar tradition, with the leading rider wearing a jersey the same pink color as the sponsoring newspaper, La Gazzetta).  Sports stars in the press box  After the Second World War, the sports sections of British national daily and Sunday newspapers continued to expand, to the point where many papers now have separate standalone sports sections; some Sunday tabloids even have sections, additional to the sports pages, devoted solely to the previous day's football reports. In some respects, this has replaced the earlier practice of many regional newspapers which - until overtaken by the pace of modern electronic media - would produce special results editions rushed out on Saturday evenings. Some newspapers, such as The Sunday Times, with 1924 Olympic 100 metres champion Harold Abrahams, or the London Evening News using former England cricket captain Sir Leonard Hutton, began to adopt the policy of hiring former sports stars to pen columns, which were often ghost written. Some such ghosted columns, however, did little to further the reputation of sports journalism, which is increasingly becoming the subject of academic scrutiny of its standards. Many \\"ghosted\\" columns were often run by independent sports agencies, based in Fleet Street or in the provinces, who had signed up the sports star to a contract and then syndicated their material among various titles. These agencies included Pardons, or the Cricket Reporting Agency, which routinely provided the editors of the Wisden cricket almanac, and Hayters. Sportswriting in Britain has attracted some of the finest journalistic talents. The Daily Mirror's Peter Wilson, Hugh McIlvanney, first at The Observer and lately at the Sunday Times, Ian Wooldridge of the Daily Mail and soccer writer Brian Glanville, best known at the Sunday Times, and columnist Patrick Collins, of the Mail on Sunday, five times the winner of the Sports Writer of the Year Award. Many became household names in the late 20th century through their trenchant reporting of events, spurring popularity: the Massacre at the Munich Olympics in 1972; Muhammad Ali's fight career, including his 1974 title bout against George Foreman; the Heysel Stadium disaster; and the career highs and lows of the likes of Tiger Woods, George Best, David Beckham, Lester Piggott and other high-profile stars. McIlvanney and Wooldridge, who died in March 2007, aged 75, both enjoyed careers that saw them frequently work in television. During his career, Wooldridge became so famous that, like the sports stars he reported upon, he hired the services of IMG, the agency founded by the American businessman, Mark McCormack, to manage his affairs. Glanville wrote several books, including novels, as well as scripting the memorable official film to the 1966 World Cup staged in England.  Investigative journalism and sport  Since the 1990s, the growing importance of sport, its impact as a global business and the huge amounts of money involved in the staging of events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cups, has also attracted the attention of investigative journalists. The sensitive nature of the relationships between sports journalists and the subjects of their reporting, as well as declining budgets experienced by most Fleet Street newspapers, has meant that such long-term projects have often emanated from television documentary makers. Tom Bower, with his 2003 sports book of the year Broken Dreams, which analyzed British football, followed in the tradition established a decade earlier by Andrew Jennings and Vyv Simson with their controversial investigation of corruption within the International Olympic Committee. Jennings and Simson's The Lords of the Rings in many ways predicted the scandals that were to emerge around the staging of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City; Jennings would follow-up with two further books on the Olympics and one on FIFA, the world football body. Likewise, award-winning writers Duncan Mackay, of The Guardian, and Steven Downes unravelled many scandals involving doping, fixed races and bribery in international athletics in their 1996 book, Running Scared, which offered an account of the threats by a senior track official that led to the suicide of their sports journalist colleague, Cliff Temple. But the writing of such exposes - referred to as \\"spitting in the soup\\" by Paul Kimmage, the former Tour de France professional cyclist, now an award-winning writer for the Sunday Times ‚Äì often requires the view of an outsider who is not compromised by the need of day-to-day dealings with sportsmen and officials, as required by \\"beat\\" correspondents. The stakes can be high when upsetting sport's powers: in 2007, England's FA opted to switch its multimillion-pound contract for UK coverage rights of the FA Cup and England international matches from the BBC to rival broadcasters ITV. One of the reasons cited was that the BBC had been too critical of the performances of the England football team. Sports books Increasingly, sports journalists have turned to long-form writing, producing popular books on a range of sporting topics, including biographies, history and investigations. Dan Topolski was the first recipient of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award in 1989, which has continued to reward authors for their excellence in sports literature.  Organizations  Most countries have their own national association of sports journalists. Many sports also have their own clubs and associations for specified journalists. These organizations attempt to maintain the standard of press provision at sports venues, to oversee fair accreditation procedures and to celebrate high standards of sports journalism. The International Sports Press Association, AIPS, was founded in 1924 during the Olympic Games in Paris, at the headquarters of the Sporting Club de France, by Frantz Reichel, the press chief of the Paris Games, and the Belgian Victor Boin. AIPS operates through a system of continental sub-associations and national associations, and liaises closely with some of the world's biggest sports federations, including the International Olympic Committee, football's world governing body FIFA, and the IAAF, the international track and field body. The first statutes of AIPS mentioned these objectives: * to enhance the cooperation between its member associations in defending sport and the professional interest of their members. * to strengthen the friendship, solidarity and common interests between sports journalists of all countries. * to assure the best possible working conditions for the members. For horse racing the Horserace Writers and Photographers‚Äô Association was founded in 1927, was revived in 1967, and represents the interests of racing journalists in every branch of the media. Press room at the Philips Stadion, home of PSV Eindhoven, prior to a press conference In Britain, the Sports Journalists' Association was founded in 1948. It stages two awards events, an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognizes outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year, and the British Sports Journalism Awards, the industry's \\"Oscars\\", sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March. Founded as the Sports Writers' Association, following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers' Association in 2002, the organization changed its title to the more inclusive SJA. Its president is the veteran broadcaster and columnist Sir Michael Parkinson. The SJA represents the British sports media on the British Olympic Association's press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members' interests in a range of activities. In March 2008, Martin Samuel, then the chief football correspondent of The Times, was named British Sportswriter of the Year, the first time any journalist had won the award three years in succession. At the same awards, Jeff Stelling, of Sky Sports, was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time, a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members. Stelling won the vote again the following year, when the Sunday Times's Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time. In the United States, the Indianapolis-based National Sports Journalism Center monitors trends and strategy within the sports media industry. The center is also home to the Associated Press Sports Editors. In more recent years, sports journalism has turned its attention to online news and press release media and provided services to Associated Press and other major news syndication services.  Fanzines and blogs  Through the 1970s and 1980s, a rise in \\"citizen journalism\\" in Europe was witnessed in the rapid growth in popularity of soccer \\"fanzines\\" - cheaply printed magazines written by fans for fans that bypassed often stilted official club match programs and traditional media. Many continue today and thrive. Some authors, such as Jim Munro, have been adopted by their clubs. Once an editor of the West Ham United fanzine Fortune's Always Dreaming, Munro was hired by the club to write for its matchday magazine and is now sports editor of The Sun Online. Other titles, such as the irreverent monthly soccer magazine When Saturday Comes, have effectively gone mainstream. The advent of the Internet has seen much of this fan-generated energy directed into sports blogs. Ranging from team-centric blogs to those that cover the sports media itself, Bleacher Report, Deadspin.com, ProFootballTalk.com, BaseballEssential.com, Tireball Sports, AOL Fanhouse, Masshole Sports, the blogs in the Yardbarker Network, and others have garnered massive followings. Blogging has also been taken up by former athletes such as Curt Schilling, Paula Radcliffe, Greg Oden, Donovan McNabb, and Chris Cooley. Smartphones The rise of smartphone use has significantly altered the way sports media has taken off. Sports media is now accessible from almost anywhere at any time. Fans can check the scores on different apps such as ESPN and Global Sports Media. Social media has also bolstered the sports media scene. Fans can not only check in with sports news on sites like Twitter and Facebook, but get more personal and direct content from the athletes and coaches. Videos and highlights of sporting events are also now easily shareable as well as journalist commentary. Since these platforms are generally free, this new wave of content is becoming a popular way to generate a following. This type of fast and easy information is very important to sports fans. This has changed the way content gets published on sites like Twitter where the author is restricted by a character count. Stories are condensed to 240 characters and are quick to the point. Sports breaking news is often first broken on Twitter. There is a big rush amongst sports insiders to be the one to break the information first. Female reporting Women have not always been in the sports reporting field. Women such as Jane Chastain and Leslie Visser are considered pioneers in women's sportscasting. Chastain was the first woman to work for a large network (CBS) and the first woman to do play-by-play in the '60s. Leslie Visser was a sportswriter for The Boston Globe before she joined CBS in 1984 as a part-time reporter. She is the only sportscaster in history, male or female, to have worked on the Final Four, NBA Finals, World Series, Monday Night Football, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, and the US Open broadcasts. She has been voted the No. 1 Female Sportscaster of all time. There has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not female reporters should be allowed in the locker rooms after games. If they are denied access, this gives male reporters a competitive advantage in the field, as they can interview players in the locker room after games. If locker room access is denied to all reporters - male and female - because of this controversy, male journalists would likely resent female reporters for having their access taken away. It wasn't until 1978 that female sports journalists were allowed to enter locker rooms for interviews. Sports Illustrated reporter, Melissa Ludtke, sued the New York Yankees for not allowing her to interview players in the locker room during the 1977 World Series. A federal judge ruled that this ban was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment. Some female reporters include Adeline Daley (whom some consider the \\"Jackie Robinson of female sportswriters\\"), Anita Martini, Tracy Dodds, Mary Garber, Lesley Visser, Marjorie Herrera Lewis, and Sally Jenkins.

He was the fourth Premier of Nova Scotia for three and a half years. Holmes was born in Springville, Nova Scotia, in Pictou County. The son of Nova Scotia politician and Canadian senator John Holmes, Holmes in 1858 founded and edited the Pictou Colonial Standard as ‚Äúa dedicated advocate of the principles of true Conservatism.‚Äù The paper and Holmes were advocates of Canadian confederation. Holmes remained editor until 1878 when he became Premier. Holmes attempted to win a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1867 but was defeated in a wave of anti-Confederation sentiment. He won a seat in 1871 and soon became de facto leader of the Conservative opposition. The Tories won the 1878 election and Holmes became Premier of the province to find the treasury depleted and the Legislative Council in the hands of the Liberals. The Tory government passed legislation to create county government, lengthened the training period for teachers, subsidized education for blind children and attempted to improve mine safety. The Liberal-dominated Upper House frustrated much of Holmes' program and he attempted three times to abolish the Legislative Council, but failed. Holmes' personal style tended to be authoritarian and this factor, along with the political impasse, led to a caucus revolt that resulted in his resignation in 1882 to accept a lucrative position as crown clerk for Halifax County. He died in Halifax.

Their reign is considered the Golden Age of the Spanish Netherlands. Isabella was one of the most powerful women in 16th and 17th century Europe. Early life =Childhood= Infantas Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catalina Micaela Isabella Clara Eugenia of Austria was born in the Palacio del bosque de Valsa√≠n, Segovia on 12 August 1566. She was the first surviving daughter of King Philip II of Spain and his third wife, Elisabeth of Valois. Her father was reportedly overjoyed at her birth and declared himself to be happier on the occasion than he would have been at the birth of a son. He already had a male heir, Carlos, Prince of Asturias, but father and son had never developed a close rapport and frequently lived in conflict with one another. Isabella was baptized by Juan Bautista Castaneo, apostolic nuncio, later Pope as Urban VII. Her godfather was her uncle John of Austria. She was named after her mother, the day of her birth, and the devotion to St. Eugenio, whose body her father had transferred the year before from Saint Dionysius of Paris to Toledo with her mother's help through her brother, the King of France. A year later, Isabella's younger sister, Catherine Michelle, was born. Their parents were very close to their daughters, buying them jams, dolls, toys, and more. However, their mother miscarried a daughter in 1568 and died the same day. Isabella and Catherine grew up beloved by her father and her stepmother, Anna of Austria, Philip's fourth wife. The sisters developed a close relationship. Their father ultimately fathered five children by Anna, all of whom died in early childhood except his heir, Philip. Although he could be ruthless in government, Philip II is frequently characterized as having been affectionate towards his daughters, there exist numerous letters which testify his deep attachment to them, each letter lovingly signed \\"Your good father\\". =Youth= Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia in her youth, by Alonso S√°nchez Coello, 1585 Isabella and Catherine were raised under the care of Margarita de Cardona, their stepmother's lady-in-waiting, and some of their mother's own ladies-in- waiting, such as Claude de Vineulx. Both sisters were described as intelligent and well aware of their high social status. Isabella had a very good education. Her studies presumably included politics, mathematics, and the languages Dutch, French and Italian besides her native Spanish. Famous artist Sofonisba Anguissola, who served as court painter at the time, influenced the Infanta's artistic works. Isabella was the only person whom King Philip permitted to help him with his work, sorting his papers and translating Italian documents into the Spanish language for him. =Candidate to the French throne= Isabella Clara Eugenia's Coat of Arms as Infanta of Spain shows the Fluers-de-lis pf Burgundy. After her maternal uncle, Henry III of France, was assassinated by the fanatical young monk Jacques Cl√©ment on 2 August 1589, Philip II claimed the French crown on Isabella's behalf despite France's Salic law, which forbade cognatic succession. At any rate, her mother had ceded any claim to the French crown with her marriage to the Spanish King. However, the Parlement de Paris, in power of the Catholic party, gave verdict that Isabella was \\"the legitimate sovereign\\" of France. The Huguenot leader, Henry III of Navarre, the actual heir by traditional French inheritance laws, ultimately made his claim to the throne, converted to Catholicism and was crowned in 1594. Marriage Proposals dwarf, c. 1599Royal Collection. As Infanta of Spain and Portugal, Isabella was quite eligible on the political marriage market, though she ended up marrying late for her time. =Engagement= At the age of two, Isabella was promised to marry her cousin Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor (18 July 1552 ‚Äì 20 January 1612), son of her aunt Maria. However, Isabella had to wait for more than 20 years before the eccentric Rudolf declared that he had no intention of marrying anybody. Meanwhile, she served as her father's primary caretaker during the last three years of his life, when he was plagued by gout and frequent illness. =Marriage= Isabella Clara Eugenia and Archduke Albert Philip decided to cede the Spanish Netherlands to Isabella on condition that she marry her cousin, Albert VII, Archduke of Austria. He was her former fianc√©'s younger brother the former Viceroy. They were to reign over the Netherlands jointly and be succeeded by their descendants according to the male-preference cognatic primogeniture but should a female succeed, she was required to marry the King of Spain or the person chosen by the King of Spain. It was stipulated that, should they have no children, the Netherlands would revert to the King of Spain upon the death of either spouse. As Albert was the Archbishop of Toledo, he had to be released from his religious commitments by Pope Clement VIII before the wedding could take place. Shortly before Philip II died on 13 September 1598, he resigned the thrones of the Netherlands in favor of Isabella and her fianc√©. The Pope celebrated the union by procuration on 15 November at Ferrera. On 18 April 1599, 33-year-old Isabella married Albert in Valencia. They had three children who died at a very young age, in 1605, 1607 and 1609. Habsburg Netherlands Isabella Clara Eugenia's Coat of Arms as Sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands Beginning in 1601, the Archduke and Archduchess ruled the Habsburg Netherlands together. Their reign is a key period in the history of the Spanish Netherlands. After Albert's death, Isabella was appointed Governor of the Netherlands on the King of Spain's behalf. She was succeeded as Governor by Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, the third son of her half-brother in 1633. =Foreign Policy= The first half of Albert and Isabella's reign was dominated by war. After overtures to the United Provinces and to Queen Elizabeth I of England proved unsuccessful, the Habsburg policy in the Low Countries aimed at regaining the military initiative and isolating the Dutch Republic. The strategy was to force its opponents to the conference table and negotiate from a position of strength. In pursuit of that goal and to get their political agenda to all Flemish social classes, Albert and Isabella used the most diverse media. The visual arts, with the baroque popularized in the wake of the Counter- Reformation, was the perfect tool. This, coupled with the political configuration of the period, made the Archdukes' Court at Brussels one of the foremost political and artistic centers in Europe of that time. It became the testing ground for the Spanish Monarchy's European plans, a boiling pot full of people of all sorts: from artists and diplomats to defectors, spies and penitent traitors, from Spanish confessors, Italian counselors, Burgundian functionaries, English musicians, German bodyguards to the Belgian Nobles. Brussels became a vital link in the chain of Habsburg Courts and the diplomatic conduits between Madrid, Vienna, Paris, London, Lisbon, Graz, Innsbruck, Prague and The Hague could be said to run through there. The accession of James VI of Scotland as James I in England had paved the way for a separate peace with England. On 24 July 1604, England, Spain and the Archducal Netherlands signed the Treaty of London. The return to peace was severely hampered by differences over religion. Events such as the Gunpowder Plot caused a lot of diplomatic tension between London and Brussels, but the relations between the two courts tended to be cordial on the whole. Anne of Denmark wore her portrait in a locket as a public token of friendship and kinship.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 141. The threat of diplomatic isolation and General Ambrogio Sp√≠nola's campaigns induced the Dutch Republic to accept a ceasefire in April 1609. The subsequent negotiations between the warring parties failed to produce a peace treaty, but lead to the Twelve Years' Truce in Antwerp on 9 April 1609. Under the Truce's terms, the United Provinces were to be regarded as a sovereign power for the duration of the truce. After four decades of war, the treaty brought a period of much-needed peace of the Southern Netherlands. =Economy= Jeton with portraits of Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and Infanta Isabella of Spain, struck in Antwerp 1612. The period of the Truce brought the Habsburg Netherlands a much-needed peace, mainly because the fields could be again worked in safety. The archducal regime encouraged the reclaiming of land that had been inundated in the course of the hostilities and sponsored the impoldering of De Moeren, a marshy area that is presently astride the Belgian‚ÄìFrench border. The recovery of agriculture led in turn to a modest increase of the population (and thus workers) after decades of demographic losses. Industry and in particular the luxury trades likewise underwent a recovery, bringing considerable economical stability and prosperity to the Southern Netherlands. However, international trade was hampered by the closure of the river Scheldt. The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of canals linking Ostend via Bruges to the Scheldt in Ghent and joining the Meuse to the Rhine between Venlo and Rheinberg. In order to combat urban poverty, the government supported the creation of a network of Monti di Piet√† based on the Italian model. =Religion= Engraving of Isabella Clara Eugenia dressed as a nun. The archducal regime ensured the triumph of the Catholic Reformation in the Habsburg Netherlands. Most Protestants had by that stage left the Southern Netherlands. After one last execution in 1597, those that remained were no longer actively persecuted. Under the terms of legislation passed in 1609, their presence was tolerated, provided they did not worship in public or engage in religious. The resolutions of the Third Provincial Council of Mechlin of 1607 were likewise given official sanction. Through such measures and by the appointment of a generation of committed bishops, Albert and Isabella laid the foundation of the catholic confessionalisation of the population. In the process of recatholisation, new and reformed religious orders enjoyed the particular support of the rulers. Even though the Archduke had certain reservations about the order, the Jesuits received the largest cash grants, allowing them to complete their ambitious building programmes in Brussels and Antwerp. The Capuchins were given considerable sums as well. The foundation of the first convents of Discalced Carmelites in the Southern Netherlands depended wholly on the personal initiative of the archducal couple and bore witness to the Spanish orientation of their spirituality. =Legislative System= The reign of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia saw a strengthening of princely power in the Habsburg Netherlands. The States General of the loyal provinces were only summoned once in 1600. Thereafter, the government preferred to deal directly with the provinces. The years of the Truce allowed the archducal regime to promulgate legislation on a whole range of matters. The so-called Eternal Edict of 1611, for instance, reformed the judicial system and ushered in the transition from customary to written law. Other measures dealt with monetary matters, the nobility, duels, gambling, etc. =Relationship with Spain= The actions of the two rulers stimulated the growth of a separate South Netherlandish identity. However, Albert and Isabella's children died a very young age and as the years passed, it became clear that they would have no more offspring and thus independence wouldn't be possible. Since then, Albert and Isabella's goal became the reincorporation of the Southern Provinces into the Spanish monarchy. They consolidated the authority of the House of Habsburg over the territory of the Southern Netherlands and largely succeeded in reconciling previous anti-Spanish sentiments. As a result, the States of the loyal provinces swore to accept the King as heir of the Archduke and Archduchess in a number of ceremonies between May 1616 and January 1617. As the Spanish King's Governor since 1621, the older, widowed Isabella alternated successes, such as that of the Capture of Breda in 1625, with failures and setbacks, such as the losses of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1625 and Maastricht in 1632. Patronage of Arts =Court of Brussels= private art gallery. Isabella and Albert stimulated the growth of this artistic movement, which resulted in the creation of the Flemish Baroque painting. Their patronage of such artists and architects as Peter Paul Rubens (their court painter since 1609), Wenceslas Cobergher, Jacob Franquart, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, the De Nole family, the Van Veens and many others made the Court of Brussels one of the foremost artistic centers in Europe of that time. However, virtually nothing remains of Albert and Isabella's palace on the Koudenberg in Brussels, their summer retreat in Mariemont or their hunting lodge in Tervuren. Their once magnificent collections were scattered after 1633 and considerable parts of them have been lost. Still, the Archdukes enjoy a well merited reputation as patrons of the arts. By far, the best preserved ensemble of art from the archducal period is to be found at Scherpenheuvel, where Albert and Isabella directed Cobergher, and Theodoor van Loon and the de Noles to create a pilgrimage church in a planned city. =Descalzas Reales= Portrait of Isabella Clara Eugenia as a nun, 1625 Isabella joined the Secular Franciscan Order and became a nun. She was of great importance to the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales, where she lived with her mother-in-law Maria. Isabella gifted major artworks to the convent, including a famous series of Brussels tapestries. This famous cycle was designed by Rubens and depicts Isabella as patron saint Clare of Assisi with Monstrance. Rumors A false anecdote links Isabella, the siege of Ostend, and the horse coat colour isabelline. In popular culture *Isabella Clara Eugenia is a minor character in the alternate history 1632 series. She is more notable in the novel, 1634: The Bavarian Crisis. She lives several years longer than in actual history. *In the 2002 alternate history novel Ruled Britannia by Harry Turtledove, where the Armada has been successful, Isabella Clara Eugenia has been made Queen of England while the deposed Elizabeth I is imprisoned in the Tower of London. *In the 2007 film Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Isabella appeared in a minor role at the side of her father, Philip II of Spain, at the time of the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada in 1588. The movie portrays Isabella as Philip's choice to replace Elizabeth on the throne of England. She was portrayed by actress Aimee King as a young girl rather than as the correct age of nineteen years.

Rinnan led a group called Sonderabteilung Lola. This group, known as Rinnanbanden among Norwegians, had fifty known members. Among them were Karl Dolmen, Arild Hjulstad-√òstby and Ivar and Kitty Grande. Biography Born in Levanger on 14 May 1915, Rinnan was the eldest of eight children in an impoverished family. Unusually short for a Norwegian man (1.61 metres - 5 ft 3 in), he was a loner during his childhood. He worked briefly for his uncle, but was sacked for theft. During the Winter War, Rinnan tried to enlist with the Finns to fight against the Soviet Union, but was rejected due to his poor physique. During the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, he drove a truck for the Norwegian Army. According to Rinnan, he was recruited by the Gestapo in June 1940. His parents were members of Nasjonal Samling, but it is uncertain if he ever was a member. After the war, former members of Nasjonal Samling attempted to disassociate themselves from the group, which was seen as a pro-German unit.Special Operations Executive: A New Instrument of War, By Mark Seaman70 √•r siden henrettelsen av Norges mest fryktede nazist (70 years since the execution of Henry Rinnan) Text, images and video by NRK Published February 1, 2017 Beginning in September 1943, the Rinnanbanden had its headquarters in Jonsvannsveien 46 in Trondheim, known as Bandeklosteret (\\"gang monastery\\"). Rinnan worked closely with the German Sicherheitspolizei in Trondheim, where his main contacts were Gerhard Flesch and Walter Gemmecke. During this decade the private residence of the Rinnan family was in the captured house of Landstads Vei 1, located approximately one kilometre from the gang's headquarters. The members of the independent Gestapo unit Sonderabteilung Lola infiltrated the resistance movement by engaging people in conversation in buses, trains, caf√©s, etc., encouraging them to talk about their attitudes toward the Nazi occupation. Having identified people who they thought were in the resistance, Rinnan's agents worked to build trust with them and penetrate their networks. The Rinnan gang was responsible for the death of at least a hundred people in the Norwegian resistance and the British Special Operations Executive, for torturing hundreds of prisoners, for more than a thousand arrests, for compromising several hundred resistance groups, and in some cases, for deceiving people into carrying out missions for the Germans. Rinnan operated with impunity and little interference from his German taskmasters, often using murder and torture as sanctioned means.Gestapo: Hitler‚Äôs Secret Terror Police By Lucas Saul During the war Rinnan was appointed SS- Untersturmf√ºhrer der Reserve, and received the Iron Cross 2nd grade in 1944. After Germany's capitulation in May 1945, Rinnan and a band of followers tried to escape into Sweden, but were caught. On 24 December he escaped from prison again, gathered some followers, but they were again apprehended after a few days.Skyggespill Episode 5:5 Spillet er slutt Documentary about the arrest of Henry Rinnan and Sonderabteilung Lola. NRK Feb 8, 1996 Henry Rinnan testifying at his trial In the course of two trials after the war, forty-one members of the Rinnan group were convicted and sentenced. Twelve received sentences of execution by firing squad from the Frostating Court of Appeal on 20 September 1946. Ten of those death sentences were carried out. Eleven other defendants were sentenced to lifelong forced labour (later pardoned), while the rest were given long prison sentences. Rinnan was sentenced for personally murdering thirteen people, but the real number may be higher. Four hours after midnight on 1 February 1947, Rinnan was taken from his cell in Kristiansten Fortress. A guard blindfolded him and led him outside, where he was tied to a pole. He showed no emotion. At 04:05, Rinnan was executed by firing squad. He was cremated, and later unofficially buried at the Levanger Cemetery in an unmarked grave.executedtoday.com, Henry Rinnan, Norwegian collaborator Forty percent of the people executed as a result of Norwegian war crimes trials after the Second World War were connected to Sonderabteilung Lola.

He first appeared as a supporting character in the 1970s comic book The Tomb of Dracula, issue #25 (Oct 1974). The character is usually depicted as a supernatural detective. The character was portrayed by Ryan Reynolds in the 2004 film Blade: Trinity. Fictional character biography Hannibal King was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A private detective making a modest living, King was bitten and killed by the vampire Deacon Frost while on a case in London, England. Waking up to find himself one of the undead, King was horrified at what he had become and vowed never to consummate the curse by passing it to another. Thus, King subsisted on blood purchased (or stolen) from blood banks and consuming only corpses or animals. King also prefers not to use his vampiric powers, believing that he gave up a part of himself every time he did so. In spite of his vampirism, King continues to operate as a private detective, but only traveling freely by night. As a vampire, he first battles Dracula, the Lord of Earth's vampires.The Tomb of Dracula #25 While searching for Deacon Frost, King eventually meets Blade, the vampire hunter, whose mother had been killed by Frost. Initially distrustful of each other, they nevertheless team up to destroy Frost. In the process, King battles a Blade doppelganger created by Deacon Frost.The Tomb of Dracula Vol. 1 #51 King and Blade then destroy Deacon FrostThe Tomb of Dracula #53 and part as eternal friends. At the time of these stories, it was revealed that King had been a vampire for about five years. While investigating the murder of a friend at the hands of the Darkholders, King contacts Doctor Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme. Through Strange, King discovers that the Darkhold contains the spell not only for creating vampires but destroying them. Through King, Strange learns of the apparent return of Dracula. King, with vampire hunters Blade and Frank Drake, join Strange in their visit to Castle Mordo where they retrieve the Darkhold. They battle Dracula and the Darkholders and then use the book to cast the Montesi Formula. This spell destroys Dracula and all current vampires then on Earth and prevented any more from being able to exist here. King was not destroyed by the Montesi Formula because he had never taken blood from a living human being, but still required Doctor Strange to perform a complete blood transfusion for King to survive, which restored him to human form.Doctor Strange vol. 2, #56-62 The trio subsequently founded a detective agency initially known simply as King, Drake, and Blade; the firm is later known as Borderline Investigations. With Doctor Strange, they fought the Darkholders again.Doctor Strange vol. 2, #67 King also assisted the Defenders on one of their missions. Alongside the Beast, Gargoyle, Daimon Hellstrom, Hellcat, Cutlass and Typhoon, and Rufus T. Hackstabber, he helped foil the plans of Minvera Bannister.The Defenders #148 Discord among the three friends caused Drake to leave the firm, after which Blade suffered a breakdown after a fight with a once-again resurrected Dracula. Dracula's return was a sign of the weakening of the Montesi Formula. King was unable to continue operating the agency on his own, as he knew his vampirism was returning. After an examination, Doctor Strange concluded that King, because of his recent reversion, had become a \\"neo-vampire\\", a special type of vampire with all the abilities and weaknesses of the vampire, yet merely craving blood despite not needing it to survive. Strange manipulated the three men into reuniting under the name Nightstalkers to combat the supernatural enemies that were emerging. In their first mission, the Nightstalkers were hired by the demonic Lilith to kill the Daniel Ketch Ghost Rider and John Blaze, and battle the Meatmarket.Nightstalkers #1 Alongside Ghost Rider, Blaze, Morbius, Doctor Strange, and the Darkhold Redeemers, the Nightstalkers battled Lilith and her Lilin.Ghost Rider vol. 3, #31 Among the enemies the Nightstalkers fought around this time were The Fallen, HYDRA's DOA, and Varnae. King and Drake were originally thought to have been killed in the explosion that destroyed Varnae. King, however, later showed up in New Orleans to help Blade fight a resurrected Deacon Frost. King also accepted an assignment from Donna Garth to locate her father, Simon Garth (the Living Zombie). King tracked Garth to New York where he was assisted by Spider-Man in rescuing Garth from Lilith. King later set up a small shop in San Francisco where a CIA agent enlisted his help in stopping a vampire plot to blackmail the Earth with biochemical weapons. During this fight, CIA agent Tatjana Stiles was injured by vampire terrorist leader Navarro; although they defeated Navarro, Stiles's injuries were too painful for her to live with. She begged King to make her like him \\"if she loves him\\". King, who had grown attracted to Stiles, reluctantly complied and broke his years-long vow. Weeks later, King read a newspaper article about the mysterious death of two Iraqi guards in an overseas search for terrorist weapons. From the description of the deaths, King had no doubt who was responsible. This led to King becoming dispirited, losing interest in his work and retreating into depression. King came to assist Blade in London where the latter confronted Draconis, a vampire impervious to all forms of exorcism.Blade #8 Blade's biological father then offered a way to restore the souls of all vampires, which he admitted would have the additional effect of removing all of their weaknesses. The rite is dependent on Blade, however, who scoffed at a plan to provide practical invulnerability to the enemy he'd sworn to destroy. Blade attempted to enlist King against his father, but King refused and attacked his former partner for denying him one of his greatest desires: to see the sunrise again. Blade ended up staking King, who then appeared to die, leaving behind only a smoking stain on the cobblestones.Blade #11 He returned (as had every other vampire that Blade had killed) soon after, and Blade gave him a potion that stopped him needing to feast on blood.Blade #12 Powers and abilities Hannibal King is a vampire, and even when King was cured of his vampirism he has retained many of his vampiric abilities without actually being a vampire. He has superhuman strength and speed and sharper senses than an average human. King is virtually immortal, possessing agelessness, immunity to diseases and poisons, and the ability to survive and heal great amounts of physical damage. He also has the ability to instantly hypnotize human victims and can fly via directed motion hovering by taking on a mist-like form. He can also control rats and used them to gather information for him during the day. He has also been known to transform into a wolf. However, King also has the weaknesses of a vampire: the need for blood in order to sustain his existence, the inability to endure direct sunlight, and the standard vampiric vulnerabilities to garlic, silver, and the presence of religious symbols. Beheading, burning, and a wooden stake through the heart will kill him. King is an excellent detective, a good marksman with a pistol, and possesses an extraordinary sense of will. He often arms himself with conventional firearms, but sometimes uses special ones against supernatural foes. Vampirism In the first appearance of Hannibal King (The Tomb of Dracula #25) and during the events of Doctor Strange (volume 2) #59-62, King had stated that he had been a vampire for about five years. During the events in Journey into Mystery #520-521, King revealed that he had been a vampire for about five decades, indicating that he had been a vampire since around the late 1940s. He has openly stated the first figure to others. The latter figure of five decades was stated by King only in narration. This also contradicts Nightstalkers #16 when King meets a man he knew in high school. This man was not elderly, but appeared to be King's own physical age (which was arrested due to vampirism) and was not a vampire (which would arrest his age) as this story predates the return of vampires. In The Tomb of Dracula #25, the reader is not told immediately that King was a vampire. This is not revealed until the final panel. In a writing fashion similar to O Henry, there are visual and dialogue cues that are cleverly placed throughout the story. Many of these instances were pointed out by observant fans in the letter column of a later issue. Marv Wolfman, in his responses to reader letters, confirmed most of them as well as added several that they missed: *King mentions in narration that on a previous case he was in a building investigating industrial espionage. A vampire killed everyone that was in said building. (As he doesn't say when the vampire arrived, read a certain way, this could be intended to include himself). *In a crowded bar scene, King does not have a reflection in the mirror behind the bar. *While on the current case, King seems to have covered a distance in ten minutes that London natives know takes about an hour on foot. He was not seen to drive a car at any time during the story. Also, it is very late at night so there is no public transport. *King enters a building that he seems to know is a trap. He reads a sign on the door that says \\"Open, please come in\\". According to vampire lore, a vampire can only enter a private residence when he is explicitly invited. *King appears in a frame having entered said building, but already upstairs. However, no staircase is seen going down to the previous floor. The frame suggests that he could have flown up and entered via the window. *King mentions in narration that a room that he is searching is pitch black, although he seems to have no problem seeing. *Dracula says to King that \\"...soon you will acknowledge me as your master.\\" In the comic, Dracula is Lord of the Vampires and does not and cannot extend his lordship beyond vampires. It was stated in Nightstalkers #1 (Aug. 1992) that King's neo-vampire status (craving blood but not needing it to survive as well as his limited ability to tolerate sunlight) was due to his never directly taking blood from a living human, also the reason he survived the Montesi Formula, the Darkhold spell that had previously destroyed all vampires. This neo-vampire condition was never alluded to again after his seeming death in Nightstalkers #18 (April 1994) and he was shown thereafter to be a regular vampire with all of the traditional strengths and weaknesses, identical to his status before the Montesi spell was cast. In other media Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King in Blade: Trinity Hannibal King is played by Ryan Reynolds in the 2004 film Blade: Trinity. In the film, King is a member of a vampire hunting group known as the Nightstalkers, led by Abigail Whistler, a character created for the film and based on a recurring character from the film franchise. The film includes the premise that King is a former vampire, having been turned by Danica Talos, and cured by the retrovirus serum that was developed in the first Blade film.

Kennedy when the latter was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas. In his reports, later testimony and interviews, Kellerman outlines in detail his role in the immediate aftermath of the assassination, controlling key evidence of the crime and guiding doctors during the official autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. History Kellerman, a New Baltimore, Michigan native, graduated from high school in 1933 and worked for the Dodge division of Chrysler sporadically from 1935 until 1937 when he was sworn in as a trooper for the Michigan State Police. Kellerman joined the Secret Service in Detroit just before Christmas 1941, transferring temporarily to the White House detail in March 1942 and permanently one month later. In 1965, Kellerman was promoted to \\"deputy special agent in charge\\", replacing Floyd Boring. He retired from the Secret Service in 1968 as an assistant administrator. Kellerman died in St. Petersburg, Florida, on March 22, 1984. Actions during assassination As the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of November 22, 1963, Shift Team #3, Kellerman was riding in the front passenger seat of the presidential limousine. The driver was Secret Service Agent William Greer. Like all Secret Service agents assigned to protect the President of the United States, Kellerman was trained to use his own body as a shield, taking a bullet if necessary in the line of duty. Kellerman, along with Secret Service agents William Greer, Clint Hill, and Rufus Youngblood, provided testimony to the Warren Commission in Washington, D.C. on March 9, 1964. Kellerman testified, \\"I turned around to find out what happened when two additional shots rang out and the President slumped into Mrs. Kennedy's lap and Governor Connally fell to Mrs. Connally's lap.\\"Roy Kellerman Treasury department report dated 11-29-63, also Warren Commission Report, Volume 18, page 724 He further testified to the Warren Commission that after he remembered hearing the first audible muzzle blast or mechanically suppressed fired bullet bow shockwave, the assassination then ended in a \\"flurry of shells\\" coming into the limousine that reminded him of a jet sonic-boom sound quickness.Warren Commission testimony, starting in Warren Commission Volume 2, page 62 The House Select Committee on Assassinations declared in 1979 that \\"the Secret Service was deficient in the performance of its duties\\" at the time of the assassination,House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report, p. 227. and that President Kennedy did not receive adequate protection in Dallas.House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report, p. 229-35. Regarding the conduct of Secret Service Agent Roy Kellerman, the HSCA noted: > No actions were taken by the agent in the right front seat of the > Presidential limousine [Roy Kellerman] to cover the President with his body, > although it would have been consistent with Secret Service procedure for him > to have done so. The primary function of the agent was to remain at all > times in close proximity to the President in the event of such > emergencies.House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report, p. > 234-35. Controller of evidence Kellerman's report and later testimony indicate that he was with the president without interruption from the motorcade's departure from Love Field, through the entire autopsy and embalming and up until the president's remains were brought back to the White House. In photographs and footage of the casket being loaded aboard Air Force One at Love Field, and later upon its arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, Kellerman can be seen directing the movements of the president's casket. Kellerman maintained his composure immediately after Kennedy's assassination, managing events as they continued to develop. Kellerman testified that he played a role in the autopsy at Bethesda, including guiding the doctors toward specific conclusions regarding bullet locations.MD 56 - Kellerman-Purdy HSCA Interview, ARRB Master Set of Medical Exhibits, August 24‚Äì25, 1977, p. 4. Kellerman also took personal custody of the X-rays and photographic negatives at the conclusion of the autopsy and took them with him as he rode in the ambulance that transported the President's casket to the White House.MD 56 - Kellerman- Purdy HSCA Interview, ARRB Master Set of Medical Exhibits, August 24‚Äì25, 1977, pp. 6-7. When asked by the House Select Committee on Assassinations staff why he wanted this material, he said \\"...the point is, he was our man, everything belonged in the White House.\\"MD 56 - Kellerman-Purdy HSCA Interview, ARRB Master Set of Medical Exhibits, August 24‚Äì25, 1977, p. 7. With Kellerman in charge of local events (and with the assistance of Greer), the Secret Service maintained custody of the most important evidence of the crime, including the president's body, clothing, limousine, forensic tissues, and autopsy photographs and X-rays, returning everything to the White House before the sun rose on November 23, 1963. According to an interview given in 1981 after John Hinckley, Jr.'s attempt to assassinate President Reagan in 1981, Kellerman did not believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. However, in 1994, Vanity Fair published an article by Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan in which they quoted Kellerman's widow, June, as stating he \\"accepted that there was a conspiracy.\\" In popular culture In the 2013 film Parkland, actor Tom Welling played the role of Kellerman.

The German Armed Forces made a practice of color-coding their invasion plans, and created plans for all countries where they thought German forces may have to fight. All variants of the plan name are listed here, but the plan will be referred to as 'Green'.It is not known which department of the German forces wrote Green, either the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) operations staff or the operations section of a subordinate command are suspected. The order to prepare the plan was issued to Generalleutnant Leonhard Kaupisch in early August 1940. Despite its detailed nature, Operation Green is thought to have been designed only as a credible threat, a feint, not an actual operation. Plan W, a planned occupation of all of the Free State by the British Armed Forces, was drafted by the British military in secret liaison with the Irish government to counteract any German invasion. German interest in Green and Operation Sea Lion must always be understood in the context of their overall strategic plan. That, first and foremost, was Operation Barbarossa, the invasion and destruction of the Soviet Union. They had little interest in tying up military resources in Britain or France, other than doing what was necessary to prevent the British and French from interfering with the invasion of the Soviet Union. During Britain's darkest hour, therefore, the Germans were, in fact, secretly marshalling most of their resources to attack the Soviet Union. Implementation of Green was the responsibility of General der Artillerie Leonhard Kaupisch, commander of the German Fourth and Seventh Army Corps, Army Group B. The originator of the idea for Green is thought to be newly promoted Generalfeldmarschall Fedor von Bock, Army Group B. Bock had operational command for the western flank under Operation Sea Lion. Once collated, thirty-two copies of Green were distributed as \\"Top Secret\\" on 8 August 1940 to the German High Command; a number of copies survived World War II. Deception or a real plan? Green was conceived in early-to mid-1940 and the plan was drawn up in August 1940, under three weeks after Hitler issued his initial warning order for Operation Sea Lion on 16 July 1940. The plan was widely circulated and even publicised during the period 1940‚Äì1941. By 1942 Green had even made its way into the hands of the Irish military via the British military and was subsequently translated into English by Irish Military Intelligence G2 Branch.Irish military intelligence G2 & G3 worked closely with the British on planning for a German invasion attempt. The first meeting took place on 24 May 1940, before the Germans had even ordered Green drawn up. The British were convinced Ireland would be occupied by the air (parachutists) although they may have based this on their own threat assessment (the island of Ireland had much weaker coastal defenses compared to the island of Britain). The British War Office suggested that up to 5000 German paratroops might be landed in Ireland, and even an \\"invasion by submarine\\" was touted. With hindsight, ideas such as these might be considered tactical browbeating by the British, aimed at persuading De Valera to permit British troops in Ireland ahead of a possible invasion. De Valera would have been understandably cautious about this due to the problems in getting them to leave originally. However, following the discovery of Green, Irish troops received British special forces training in Armagh. This has raised suspicion that intercepted 'chatter' about Green may have been aimed at creating a 'bogeyman' in the minds of British military planners on their western flank. There was some truth to this; one example is Generalmajor Walter Warlimont's recollection from 28 June 1940 of an operational instruction issued by the High Command. The directive was to mislead the enemy about a possible invasion of neutral Ireland using \\"all available information media\\". The intention was to spread rumours that German forces were preparing a landing in Ireland to place a further stranglehold on Britain, reinforcing the current \\"siege\\".Generalmajor Walter Warliamont was Deputy Chief of OKW Operations Staff. See Walter Warliamont \\"Inside Hitler's Headquarters\\" (Weidenfeld) London 1964 p.106 It is possible that these efforts heightened the state of alert and were a cause of alarm in Britain, leading to the British expending significant effort in trying to convince the Irish government to abandon neutrality and side with the Allies.These liaisons were mostly held at the level of military intelligence chiefs on either side but culminated in the infamous false bribe to \\"give Northern Ireland back\\" to the Irish if they came into the war. =Hitler's views= Despite the propaganda, Green was an actual military plan that was given real consideration. Although Hitler had postponed Sea Lion on 17 September 1940, he took up a personal interest again on 3 December 1940 after hearing of radio reports alluding to a British invasion of Ireland.Unlike Sweden (iron ore), Romania (oil), Czechoslovakia (industrial infrastructure) Ireland didn't have much to offer Hitler. The value of Ireland was in its geographical proximity to Britain and the Atlantic. It had immediate strategic value. Hitler then ordered Raeder's naval staff to investigate the feasibility of occupying Ireland to pre-empt any British attempt. However, at the time Hitler seemed already convinced that any landing should be by invitation only: > \\"..a landing in Ireland can be attempted only if Ireland requests help. For > the present our envoy [assumed to be Dr. Eduard Hempel of the German > Legation] must ascertain whether De Valera desires support and whether he > wishes to have his military equipment supplemented by captured British war > material (guns and ammunition), which could be sent to him in independent > ships. Ireland is important to the Commander in Chief, Air, [G√∂ring] as his > base for attacks on the north-west ports of Britain, although weather > conditions must be investigated. The occupation of Ireland might lead to the > end of the war.\\"See David Irving \\"Hitler's War\\" (Hodder) London 1977 p.185. > Although taken from the Wehrmacht situation conference of 3 December 1940 > and is not specifically ascribed to Hitler but it seems likely. \\"Der Besitz > Irlands k√∂nne das Ende des Krieges herbeif√ºhren\\" ‚Äì literally \\"The possession > of Ireland could bring about the end of the war\\" =Raeder's estimation= The estimation of Grand Admiral Erich Raeder of the Naval High Command was lukewarm, just as it had been for Sea Lion.Hitler had left the success or failure of Sea Lion resting mostly on the shoulders of Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring of the Luftwaffe. See Operation Sea Lion for details. His concern was German naval strength and resupply of any landed troops: > \\"To a defending force, cut off and left to its own devices, the topography > of the country [Ireland] does not afford us much protection... without > supplies and reinforcements they would soon feel the increasing pressure of > British expeditionary force brought over under the protection of British > naval power; sooner or later our own troops would face a situation similar > to Namsos or Dunkirk.\\"See A. Martienssen \\"Hitler and his Admirals (Secker & > Warburg) London 1948 Appendix II. In this sense Green can be seen as a worst-case scenario for the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). While Kaupisch was to continue planning and training for Sea Lion/Green he seems to have shelved preparations in late 1940 and not returned to them. From his point of view Green had become a feint. This view is reinforced by examining one of the warnings offered to participating German forces in the plan: > \\"The 'Green' operation confronts us with an entirely new task. Therefore > there are no precedents from which we can work. In many cases, troops will > have to look after themselves. Each commander must look for a way to achieve > his individual objective. Everything depends on the extent of co-operation, > on each individual's alertness and ability to take independent action. > Confidence in the achievements of German Leadership and the German Soldier > should be the foundation of this operation.\\" The prognosis for German land forces taking part in Green was therefore not good. They had no experience of large-scale amphibious warfare; they might have to fight and survive, without resupply, artillery support or screening aerial support, amongst a hostile citizenry. They would have to fight against expected British troop movements from the north of the island, and from Great Britain invading Ireland to protect its flank. These drawbacks, whilst probably acceptable to Hitler, were not acceptable to Raeder in his considered estimation four months after the plan was first floated. He did not agree that Ireland could become the \\"backdoor\\" into Britain with the present strength of German forces. As Sea Lion was rescheduled on 12 October 1940 for the Spring of 1941, then permanently cancelled on 13 February 1943, Green became an irrelevance. Accuracy and detail of Green Despite the fact that Abwehr intelligence-gathering in Ireland had not begun until mid-1939, Green was thorough in detail. This can probably be attributed to the intelligence- gathering of German civilians based in Ireland during the 1930s. That the plan for Green was completed days after being ordered is a testament to the planning staff in collating the data. Hitler's hope of a d√©tente or non- aggression pact of some kind with the British, whom he considered the \\"natural allies\\" of Nazi Germany, led to him disallowing Abwehr intelligence-gathering in Britain during the run-up to the war in 1936‚Äì1938.Hitler was a big fan of the British and their Empire, some recollections here . Even when intelligence-gathering was attempted following the fall of France it was mostly disastrous (see Operation Lobster I and Operation Seagull). As Sea Lion was postponed and eventually shelved following the launching of Operation Barbarossa, the planning staff working on it issued two reprints, adding detail as they went. =Detail in Green= The full briefing package for Green runs to five volumes, each devoted to a particular area of military interest. A good example of the detail is a seventy five-page booklet titled \\"Milit√§rgeographische Angaben √ºber Irland\\" (\\"Military Geographical data on Ireland\\").Germany. 1940. Milit√§rgeographische Angaben √ºber Irland. Berlin: Generalstab des Heeres, Abt. f√ºr Kriegskarten und Vermessungswesen (IV. Mil.-Geo.). This booklet described the frontier, size, historical background, industry, transport infrastructure, vegetation, climate, and weather of the island. It also included seventeen pages of detailed sketches of 233 cities, towns, and villages, complete with a lexicon.The material in the booklet was mostly culled from a number of pre-war German publications on the island including detailed work provided by Dr. Ludwig M√ºhlhausen during his stay in the Gaeltacht. 120 photos accompanied the booklet; annexes contained street maps of twenty-five cities and towns, including street names and addresses of garage owners. A second print of the plan in October 1941 added 332 photographs of the Irish countryside and coastline, mostly tourist photos, which were used to reference highly accurate Ordnance Survey maps. There were also details on spring tides, geological formations and possible routes German troops could take off projected invasion beaches. Another addendum included in the further reprinting of the plan in 1942 by the OKL (Luftwaffe High Command), titled \\"K√ºsten-Beschreibung des Irischen Freistaates (Irland)\\" (\\"Coastal description of the Irish Free State\\"), contained high-altitude aerial photographs of the areas in question, some taken from 30,000 feet, with houses and trees visible.The Ireland government was well aware of Luftwaffe surveillance missions over its territory having examined photographic equipment in crashed Luftwaffe planes and shot at Luftwaffe planes on surveillance missions over its coastline. Green contained a number of high resolution photographs of possible landing areas taken by German spotter planes through the 1940‚Äì1942 period. Despite this attention to detail, and the improvements in the volume of data with each reprinting, a lot of the data was out of date or incomplete. For example, the Galway‚ÄìClifden railway is described as being operational, but it had closed in 1935. Ireland was also described as perfectly suited to military operations because of its \\"excellent network of roads\\", and details on population centres such as Derry and Belfast were accurate but lacked information on British troop concentrations based in these cities. On the other hand, the Ardnacrusha power station on the lower Shannon was entirely detailed in the plan, thanks to the help of the German firm Siemens, which had built it prior to the war. Military details of Plan Green Green is often confused with a plan authored by the Irish Republican Army and sent to German Intelligence (Abwehr) in August 1940.The details of Green have been known for some time and the 'confusion' can often be attributed to attempts at political point scoring in Britain and Ireland over the 'links' between the IRA and German Government of the time. The IRA authored plan was later titled \\"Plan Kathleen\\" by the Abwehr and \\"Operation Artus\\" by the German Foreign Ministry.Plan Kathleen is the term most commonly in use. A copy of the plan was discovered at one of the residences of Abwehr agent Hermann G√∂rtz in 1940. The plan is often (wrongly) cited as an Abwehr plan which the IRA adopted. The opposite it true- the IRA sent the plan to the Germans on their own initiative in April 1940. \\"Plan Kathleen\\" was seen as a joke by the Abwehr and German Foreign Ministry staff who first encountered it and its very unlikely that it came to the attention of Hitler or the High Command as a 'military plan' considering its naivety. See Stephan Enno \\"Spies in Ireland\\" 1963 ( (reprint)) for a record of the original meeting between Stephen Carrol Held the IRA's emissary, and the Abwehr. Green and Plan Kathleen should not be confused. There are no details in Green on the politics of Ireland, only military capacity estimates. Green makes no mention of the IRA in these estimates, and it is fair to say that even if the planners had wanted to include detail and estimates of the IRA they would not have gained much accurate information from the Abwehr. =Green within Sea Lion framework= Leaving aside the possible propaganda and tactical aims of Green, the military planning aspects of Green are best considered as complementing the aims of Sea Lion. In pursuit of Sea Lion, Plan Green was thought to meet a number of military objectives: *to draw off British Army troops stationed in Northern Ireland who might otherwise be sent to aid the defence of Britain, *deny Ireland as a staging point/refuge to British troops, *provide a staging post for Luftwaffe forces to subdue northern Britain. In the event of Sea Lion's success, fulfilment of Green was expected to be the next step, insofar as operational plans stay static during wartime. No plans for the imposition of government in Ireland, but 'rounding up of dissidents' were included as part of Green.No plans were made even for enemies of the Third Reich in British dominated Northern Ireland. Such plans existed for British elites and 'dissidents' in the form of The Black Book. Dublin was mentioned as one of six German administrative headquarters between the two islands that were to be established on the successful completion of Sea Lion. =Implementation and objectives of the plan= The jumping off point for Green was to be the French ports of Lorient, Saint-Nazaire, and Nantes with an initial force of 3,900 troops. The objective was to be an eighty-five-mile stretch of the southern coast of Ireland between Wexford and Dungarvan. Having captured the ports there, German units were expected to fight their way up to thirty miles inland to establish a beach-head running from Gorey on the Wexford-Dublin road across the 2,610 feet height of Mount Leinster above Borris, County Carlow, through Thomastown in County Kilkenny, to Clonmel in County Tipperary. The first landings were to include Artillery and commando squadrons and a motorised infantry battalion. A bridge building battalion was also to be landed along with three anti-aircraft companies and several 'raiding patrols'- to probe Irish Army defences. Reserves from the German 61st, 72nd, and 290th Divisions were to take up occupation duties in the Gorey-Dungarvan bridgehead once it had been established. The overall details for the plan appear to be sketchy from this point onwards, and mostly would have depended on the success or failure of Operation Sea Lion in Britain. =Amphibious assault= Beach-heads considered in Green included the Waterford-Wexford sector (favoured), the estuary of the River Shannon near Limerick, Galway Bay, Donegal Bay with Killala, Ballina and Sligo, Lough Foyle with Derry, the 'Bay of Belfast' (Belfast Lough), and Cobh in Cork. The landings were to be effected by sea craft available in occupied France at the time, but there were few in existence and Operation Sea Lion was to have priority- further reasons why Raeder was not happy with Green. Green was expected to use over 50,000 German troops and Sea Lion was expected to use 160,000 but for Green the Germans only found two steamships available around the north-western ports of France- the French Versailles and the German Eule together with three small coasters: Mebillo, Clio and Franzine. It is also worth pointing out that to get to Ireland the departing ships would have had to circumnavigate the British coastline at Cornwall. Every vessel taking part in Green was to carry anti- aircraft weaponry indicating that the planners expected the Royal Air Force (RAF) to intercept them, although air cover from the Luftwaffe's West of France Air Command was to be provided as part of Sea Lion. Irish defences against Green It was anticipated that Irish forces would resist the initial invasion. Landing craft and vessels transporting the German troops were to be equipped with forward-facing guns, and invading troops were instructed to assume defensive positions as soon as they came under fire, considering retreat only in the most dire emergency. There were gaps in the German planning; for instance the plans for the proposed incursion of Cobh (as a possible beach-head area in Green) is not accompanied by details of the 9.2 inch and 6 inch artillery defences located there. This weaponry had formed part of the defences of the Treaty Ports, which the British had handed over to Irish forces in 1938. Green dealt only with the plan for invasion, as no details on any subjugation of the population and eventual conquest of the entire island were included. Among the Irish population, however, there was an element of support for the Third Reich due to resentment of past British rule. Sketchiness with regards to the plan has contributed to an assessment that it was more a diversionary attack than actual attempt to take over the island, although once committed it may have been hard for the German forces to withdraw. Involvement of the IRA There was no involvement or prior knowledge of Green by the IRA in Ireland. It is likely, however, that the possibility of such planning was on the mind of Sean Russell and his acting Chief of Staff Stephen Hayes. Russell is known to have reached out to the German Foreign Ministry and Abwehr during his time in Berlin, and Hayes is known to have sanctioned Plan Kathleen before it was delivered to the Abwehr in Berlin in August 1940. However, no operational instructions were issued to Abwehr agents to gather data on Ireland in preparation for Green.Infiltration of Ireland was forbidden by Chief of the Abwehr Wilhelm Canaris following the failure of Operation Lobster I, this did not prevent further missions by regional 'Asts' however. This is possibly because the planners felt they had enough militarily useful data already, but likely because Green, although thorough, was created in a hurry. Later editions contained no data from the IRA, instead only adding from publicly available information in reference books and details provided by German civilians who had worked in Ireland during the 1930s.

The film also spawned a soundtrack for which Braff, who picked the music himself, won a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.  Plot  Struggling actor Andrew Largeman wakes up from a dream‚Äîin which he apathetically sits on a crashing plane‚Äîto a telephone message from his father, telling Andrew that he needs to return home because his mother has died. Andrew leaves Los Angeles and returns home to New Jersey to attend the funeral. He recognizes the grave- diggers as old friends Mark and Dave, who invite him to a party that night. At home, Andrew's father gets him a doctor's appointment for headaches that he's been having. Later that night, Andrew goes to the party where he meets up with Mark, Dave, and Jesse, an old friend who has just earned a fortune after creating silent Velcro. After smoking marijuana and taking ecstasy at the party, he still remains detached. The morning after the party, Andrew proceeds to the appointment. In the waiting room, he meets a young woman named Sam, who is a pathological liar. She later explains that most times she does not know why she lies and will always admit to them afterward. In Andrew's meeting with his doctor, it is revealed that Andrew has been on lithium and other mood stabilizers, as well as antidepressants, since the age of 10, but has recently stopped taking them. He also says that his father, who is his psychiatrist, put him on the medication. Andrew finds Sam outside the office and offers her a ride home. Sam invites him into her house, and he meets her mother, who inadvertently reveals that Sam has epilepsy. Andrew tells Sam of his mother's death, and Sam tearfully eulogizes her hamster. After returning home, Andrew's father confronts him and is insistent that they have a talk before Andrew leaves. Later, Andrew and Jesse sit in the cemetery as Mark digs another grave. Andrew observes Mark stealing jewelry from the corpse he is burying. Andrew then returns to Sam's house, and the two spend the rest of the day together, joining his friends later at Jesse's mansion. Andrew tells Sam that he pushed his mother in frustration when he was nine years old, knocking her over a broken dishwasher in an accident that left her paraplegic; he says that his father blames him for his mother's paralysis and put him on his medications to \\"curb the anger\\" he supposedly harbors. Sam listens, and Andrew then admits his feelings for her. The next day, Mark tells Andrew that he needs help \\"tracking down\\" a going-away present for him. Sam, Andrew, and Mark spend the day together, ending it in a quarry in Newark where Mark talks to a man named Albert, who is employed in keeping intruders out of the quarry. The three visitors discuss the reasons for which Albert and his wife choose to live in the quarry. Albert explains that living there and exploring the quarry is \\"doing something that's completely unique, that's never been done before,\\" mirroring an earlier speech by Sam. Finally, Albert explains that what actually matters is living with his family. Andrew is inspired by the conversation, and outside in the rain, he climbs atop a derelict crane and screams into the quarry, joined by Sam and Mark. He and Sam then share a kiss. When Sam and Andrew look at the gift later on, it turns out to be Andrew's mother's favorite pendant, one of the items Mark stole from her grave, sold, and subsequently located. Andrew eventually talks with his father, and states that he was not to blame for his mother's accident and that he will live the rest of his life without medications. He forgives his father and says he wants to build a better relationship with him. The morning after, Andrew says his goodbyes to Sam at the airport, while she begs him not to leave. He acknowledges that she has changed his life but also recognizes that he still has to fix his personal problems before continuing the relationship. Andrew boards the flight, and Sam is left crying in a telephone booth. Andrew then returns, saying that he doesn't want to waste any more of his life without Sam. He wonders what to do next, and the two then kiss.  Cast  * Zach Braff as Andrew Largeman, a depressed, heavily medicated, struggling young actor who waits tables for a Vietnamese restaurant.

The title of the film was originally intended to be Large's Ark, in reference to Braff's character (note that Albert mentions his own ark in the movie), but he changed it because no one understood what it meant. The title alludes both to the nickname for New Jersey, and to lines from Andrew Marvell's poem \\"The Garden\\" (\\"Such was that happy garden-state/While man there walked without a mate\\"). Garden State was filmed over 25 days in April and May 2003, with a budget of $2.5 million.\\"Garden State\\". Box Office Mojo. Retrieved September 9, 2012. Most of the film was shot on location in Braff's hometown of South Orange, New Jersey, with filming also taking place at Cranford, Livingston, Maplewood, Newark, Tenafly and Wallington as well as New York City and Los Angeles. Braff has cited such films as Harold and Maude, Woody Allen films (specifically Annie Hall and Manhattan), and the films of Alexander Payne as influences on Garden State. The film is partly autobiographical, depicting Braff's own emotions while he was writing the screenplay. He described that \\"When I wrote Garden State, I was completely depressed, waiting tables and lonesome as I've ever been in my life. The script was a way for me to articulate what I was feeling; alone, isolated, 'a dime a dozen' and homesick for a place that didn't even exist.\\"  Music  The music that accompanied the film was hand-picked by Zach Braff. Commenting on the selections, Braff said that \\"Essentially, I made a mix CD with all of the music that I felt was scoring my life at the time I was writing the screenplay.\\" Braff used many artists he used in other works. Braff accepted a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The film's trailer won an award for Best Music at the Golden Trailer Awards. The Broadcast Film Critics Association nominated it for Best Soundtrack.

Release  The film was first screened on January 16, 2004, at the Sundance Film Festival where it was purchased in a joint venture by Fox Searchlight Pictures and Miramax for US$5 million, double the film's budget. Fox Searchlight Pictures president Peter Rice said of the film, \\"Having enjoyed the film immensely, we look forward to working with Miramax to bring Garden State to audiences worldwide.\\" From March until mid July, it screened at other various film festivals until it received a limited release on July 28 in North America. It became only the fourth non-documentary feature to top the chart that year, as calculated by per screen average, since Memorial Day weekend. Stephen Gilula, president of distribution at Fox Searchlight, attributed the film's gradual success to word of mouth and a publicity tour by Braff leading up to the film's theatrical debut. Gilula said, \\"Zach [Braff] had a cross-country tour, and we [organized] word of mouth screenings, where we had to turn people away. Zach did Q&As; following [the screenings].\\" From late 2004 through mid-2005, Garden State was shown at more festivals and was released in over 30 countries. In limited release, the film earned about $26.7 million in North American box office, and a total $35.8 million worldwide.  Reception  = Critical response = Garden State received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 86% approval rating, based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 7.44/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Delivering a quirky spin on familiar twentysomething tropes -- with a cannily-placed soundtrack -- Garden State has enough charm to mark a winning debut for first-time director Zach Braff.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 67 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Peter Debruge of Premiere wrote: \\"Garden State gets it. Not since \\"The Graduate\\" has a movie nailed the beautiful terror of standing on the brink of adulthood with such satisfying precision.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote: \\"This is not a perfect movie; it meanders and ambles and makes puzzling detours. But it's smart and unconventional, with a good eye for the perfect detail.\\" Some reviews were more mixed. Variety's Todd McCarthy said \\"Feels too piecemeal and ultimately inconsequential.\\" Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club wrote: \\"Garden State coasts on this considerable charm until it hits a brick wall in its final segments\\". Natalie Portman's character has been used as prime example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope, since the term was coined. = Awards = Empire placed Garden State at number 393 on their list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time. In 2014, Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone referred to Garden State as the film \\"that helped make Hollywood safe for indie pop\\". In addition to being a nominee for the Grand Jury prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, Braff received Best New Director from the Chicago Film Critics Association, the Florida Film Critics Circle's Pauline Kael Breakout Award, Best Debut Director award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, Breakout of the Year from the Phoenix Film Critics Society. and Hollywood Breakthrough Director of the Year Award at the Hollywood Film Festival.  Home media release  After its limited release in theaters, the film gained more popularity during its DVD release on December 28, 2004, which includes commentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes. It was first released on Blu- ray in the UK on February 19, 2012. The Blu-ray version of the film was released in the U.S. on March 4, 2014 by Fox Searchlight.\\"Store\\". Wish I Was Here.

It was part of the X-plane series and specifically of NASA's Hyper-X program. It set several airspeed records for jet aircraft. The X-43 is the fastest aircraft on record at approximately Mach 9.6.Thompson, Elvia, Keith Henry and Leslie Williams. \\"Faster Than a Speeding Bullet: Guinness Recognizes NASA Scramjet.\\" NASA. Retrieved: August 1, 2011. A winged booster rocket with the X-43 placed on top, called a \\"stack\\", was drop launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. After the booster rocket (a modified first stage of the Pegasus rocket) brought the stack to the target speed and altitude, it was discarded, and the X-43 flew free using its own engine, a scramjet. The first plane in the series, the X-43A, was a single-use vehicle, of which three were built. The first X-43A was destroyed after malfunctioning in flight in 2001. Each of the other two flew successfully in 2004, setting speed records, with the scramjets operating for approximately 10 seconds followed by 10-minute glides and intentional crashes into the ocean. Plans for more planes in the X-43 series have been suspended or cancelled. Development The X-43 was a part of NASA's Hyper-X program, involving the American space agency and contractors such as Boeing, Micro Craft Inc, Orbital Sciences Corporation and General Applied Science Laboratory (GASL). Micro Craft Inc. built the X-43A and GASL built its engine. One of the primary goals of NASA's Aeronautics Enterprise was the development and demonstration of technologies for air- breathing hypersonic flight. Following the cancellation of the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program in November 1994, the United States lacked a cohesive hypersonic technology development program. As one of the \\"better, faster, cheaper\\" programs developed by NASA in the late 1990s, Hyper-X used National Aerospace Plane technology, which moved it quickly toward the demonstration of hypersonic air breathing propulsion. The Hyper-X Phase I was a NASA Aeronautics and Space Technology Enterprise program conducted jointly by the Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, and the Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California. Langley was the lead center and responsible for hypersonic technology development. Dryden was responsible for flight research. Phase I was a seven-year, approximately $230 million, program to flight-validate scramjet propulsion, hypersonic aerodynamics and design methods. Subsequent phases were not continued, as the X-43 series of aircraft was replaced by the X-51. Design Artist's concept of X-43A with scramjet attached to the underside NASA's B-52B launch aircraft takes off carrying the X-43A hypersonic research vehicle (March 27, 2004) The X-43A aircraft was a small unpiloted test vehicle measuring just over in length.Harsha, Phillip T., Lowell C. Keel, Anthony Castrogiovanni and Robert T. Sherrill. ‚ÄúX-43A Vehicle Design and Manufacture.‚Äù AIAA 2005-3334. Retrieved: August 1, 2011. The vehicle was a lifting body design, where the body of the aircraft provides a significant amount of lift for flight, rather than relying on wings. The aircraft weighed roughly . The X-43A was designed to be fully controllable in high-speed flight, even when gliding without propulsion. However, the aircraft was not designed to land and be recovered. Test vehicles crashed into the Pacific Ocean when the test was over. Traveling at Mach speeds produces a lot of heat due to the compression shock waves involved in supersonic aerodynamic drag. At high Mach speeds, heat can become so intense that metal portions of the airframe could melt. The X-43A compensated for this by cycling water behind the engine cowl and sidewall leading edges, cooling those surfaces. In tests, the water circulation was activated at about Mach 3\\\\. =Engine= Langley's , high-temperature wind tunnel. The craft was created to develop and test a supersonic-combustion ramjet, or \\"scramjet\\" engine, an engine variation where external combustion takes place within air that is flowing at supersonic speeds.Swinerd 2010. p. 113. The X-43A's developers designed the aircraft's airframe to be part of the propulsion system: the forebody is a part of the intake airflow, while the aft section functions as an exhaust nozzle.Martin, Guy. ‚ÄúHypersonic Pioneer: The X-43A.‚Äù AircraftInFormation.info. Retrieved: August 16, 2012. The engine of the X-43A was primarily fueled with hydrogen fuel. In the successful test, about of the fuel was used. Unlike rockets, scramjet-powered vehicles do not carry oxygen on board for fueling the engine. Removing the need to carry oxygen significantly reduces the vehicle's size and weight. In the future, such lighter vehicles could take heavier payloads into space or carry payloads of the same weight much more efficiently. Scramjets only operate at speeds in the range of Mach 4.5 or higher, so rockets or other jet engines are required to initially boost scramjet-powered aircraft to this base velocity. In the case of the X-43A, the aircraft was accelerated to high speed with a Pegasus rocket launched from a converted Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber. The combined X-43A and Pegasus vehicle was referred to as the \\"stack\\" by the program's team members. The engines in the X-43A test vehicles were specifically designed for a certain speed range, only able to compress and ignite the fuel-air mixture when the incoming airflow is moving as expected. The first two X-43A aircraft were intended for flight at approximately Mach 7, while the third was designed to operate at speeds greater than at altitudes of or more. Operational testing CFD image of the X-43A at Mach 7 The X-43A being dropped from under the wing of a B-52B Stratofortress NASA's first X-43A test on June 2, 2001 failed because the Pegasus booster lost control about 13 seconds after it was released from the B-52 carrier. The rocket experienced a control oscillation as it went transonic, eventually leading to the failure of the rocket's starboard elevon. This caused the rocket to deviate significantly from the planned course, and it was destroyed as a safety precaution. An investigation into the incident stated that imprecise information about the capabilities of the rocket as well as its flight environment contributed to the accident. Several inaccuracies in data modeling for this test led to an inadequate control system for the particular Pegasus rocket used, though no single factor could ultimately be blamed for the failure.Bentley 2008, p. 110. In the second test in March 2004, the Pegasus fired successfully and released the test vehicle at an altitude of about . After separation, the engine's air intake was opened, the engine ignited, and the aircraft then accelerated away from the rocket reaching . Fuel was flowing to the engine for 11 seconds, a time in which the aircraft traveled more than . Following Pegasus booster separation, the vehicle experienced a small drop in speed but the scramjet engine afterward accelerated the vehicle in climbing flight.Bentley 2008, pp. 110‚Äì111. After burnout, controllers were still able to maneuver the vehicle and manipulate the flight controls for several minutes; the aircraft, slowed by air resistance, fell into the ocean. With this flight the X-43A became the fastest free-flying air-breathing aircraft in the world. NASA flew a third version of the X-43A on November 16, 2004. The modified Pegasus rocket was launched from a B-52 mother ship at an altitude of .

Variants After the X-43 tests in 2004, NASA Dryden engineers said that they expected all of their efforts to culminate in the production of a two-stage-to-orbit crewed vehicle in about 20 years. The scientists expressed much doubt that there would be a single-stage-to-orbit crewed vehicle like the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) in the foreseeable future. Other X-43 vehicles were planned, but they have been suspended or canceled. They were expected to have the same basic body design as the X-43A, though the aircraft were expected to be moderately to significantly larger in size. =X-43B= The X-43B, was expected to be a full-size vehicle, incorporating a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) engine or a rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) ISTAR engine.

While most scramjet designs have used hydrogen for fuel, HyTech runs with conventional kerosene-type hydrocarbon fuels, which are more practical for support of operational vehicles. The building of a full-scale engine was planned which would use its own fuel for cooling. The engine cooling system would have acted as a chemical reactor by breaking long-chain hydrocarbons into short-chain hydrocarbons for a rapid burn.

Background The Marquess of Pembroke The then extinct title of Earl of Pembroke had been very significant for the House of Tudor. It was held by Henry VIII's grand-uncle, Jasper Tudor, and it referred to the birthplace of King Henry VII. Henry VIII decided to raise his lover to the dignity of a marquess prior to finally marrying her. He chose to grant her the Marquessate of Pembroke. Creation On Sunday, 1 September 1532, Anne Boleyn was granted the Marquessate of Pembroke and land, mostly in Wales, worth over ¬£1,000. The investiture ceremony was performed by Henry VIII himself in Windsor Castle. The ceremony was an elaborate affair, witnessed by the highest ranking peers and clergy in the kingdom, including Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire and Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Anne's father and uncle respectively; Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk (Henry's brother-in-law); Edward Lee, Archbishop of York; John Stokesley, Bishop of London; and Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester. The French ambassador was also present. The Bishop of Winchester read the patent of creation while Anne knelt before the King who then invested her with the coronet, the robe of estate and the charters of creation and of the lands. The sixteenth-century spelling of her title was often marquesse or marquess, sometimes lady marquesse; a feminine, like duchess, of the relatively rare title marquys.OED \\"Marquis\\" sense 3.; compare the quotation under \\"Marchioness\\": Cum‚Ä•Domina Anna, tunc Marchionissa Penbrochi√¶, nunc vero Regina. See also Complete Peerage Vol. V, App. H Succession The marquessate was granted to Anne and her heirs male, but the patent did not include the usual provision that the said heirs male had to be of legitimate birth, thus enabling the title to pass to any illegitimate son Anne might have had. The attending peers did not fail to notice this unusual omission. End of the Marquessate It is not clear how the Marquessate of Pembroke ceased to exist. There are three possibilities: *It may have merged with the Crown on the marriage of the Marquess to the King on 28 May 1533. *It may have been forfeited on 15 May 1536, when Anne was declared guilty of high treason. *It may have become extinct on Anne's death, without male heirs, on 19 May 1536.

Until 1945, he was the internationally recognized Polish head of state, and the Polish Government in Exile was recognized as the continuum to the Polish government of 1939. Early life and studies W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz was born in Kutaisi, the second-largest city in Georgia, at that time part of the Russian Empire to Polish parents J√≥zef Raczkiewicz, a court judge, and Ludwika ≈Åukaszewicz. He studied in Saint Petersburg where he joined the Polish Youth Organization. After graduating from the Faculty of Law at the University of Dorpat he was employed as a lawyer in Minsk. Upon the outbreak of World War I he served in the Russian Imperial Army, but after the Russian Revolution he joined the vanguard for Polish independence. Serving as the head of the Naczelny Polski Komitet Wojskowy, he helped to create the Polish I Corps in Russia. Later he served under future Marshal and chief-of-state J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who created the Polish Legions that ultimately aided Poland in re-establishing its independence. As a volunteer he fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War between 1919 and 1920. At first supporter of endecja faction, later joined the sanacja camp headed by Pi≈Çsudski and his closest supporters. Raczkiewicz served as the Voivode of the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship from 1921 to 1924; government delegate to Wilno Voivodeship (1924‚Äì1925) and later as its voivode (1926‚Äì1931). After the Brest elections he was appointed the Senate Marshal (1930‚Äì1935) and Voivode of Krak√≥w Voivodeship in 1935, and Pomeranian Voivodeship from 1936 to 1939. World War II When Poland was invaded by the Wehrmacht in 1939, he escaped to Angers where the Polish government-in-exile was established. He lived in the nearby Ch√¢teau de Pignerolle from 2 December 1939 until moving on 10 June 1940 to London, where he joined General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk in the relocated Polish government in exile. He was an opponent of the Sikorski‚ÄìMayski agreement. The government under Raczkiewicz and Sikorski promoted a liberal-democratic agenda with equal rights for the Polish-Jewish minority, a view not shared by the majority of Polish society at the time and a departure from pre-war antisemitic administrations.Rogers, Barbara. \\"British Intelligence and the Holocaust: Auschwitz and the Allies Re- examined.\\" The Journal of Holocaust Education 8.1 (1999): 89-106. quote: \\"The PGE, formed in Paris in 1939, had adopted a radically different stance from previous Polish administrations, which had implemented anti-Semitic measures, perceiving Jews as a 'foreign', economically burdensome, superfluous and a morally destructive element. The PGE under Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz and Wladyslaw Sikorski had pledged liberal democratic political order, upholding equal rights for Jews in Poland, although this view was not necessarily shared by a majority in Polish society. A letter sent to the British Foreign Office from Prince Radziwill in Warsaw, for example, explained that although Poles were against 'Jewish persecution', anti-Semitism was still strong 'among all spheres of the population', and that after the war Polish society would not permit the Jews to return to their 'dominating position' in the economic world, wholesale trade and industry. Radziwill stated that to his mind the PGE did not realise the intensity of Polish feeling; anti-Semitism had intensified due to the attitude of Polish Jews who had partly blamed the Poles for their suffering by unnecessarily provoking the war.\\" In February 1945, Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt held the Yalta Conference. The future of Poland was one of the main topics that was deliberated upon. Stalin claimed that only a strong, pro-Soviet government in Poland would be able to guarantee the security of the Soviet Union. As a result of the conference, the Allies agreed to withdraw their recognition of the Polish Government in Exile, after the formation of a new government on Polish territory. Raczkiewicz died in exile in 1947, in the Welsh town of Ruthin. He is buried in the cemetery at Newark-on-Trent in England.

He was the last pre-communist rule Prime Minister of Romania, serving from 7 December 1944 to 1 March 1945. Biography =Early life and education= The son of small landowners (Radu and Zamfira), RƒÉdescu was born on 30 March 1874 in CƒÉlimƒÉne»ôti, V√¢lcea County. He attended the Military School for Officers, graduating on 1 July 1898 with the rank of second lieutenant. He pursued his military studies at the Cavalry School, graduating in June 1900 and being promoted to lieutenant in 1903, and then at the Higher War School in Bucharest (1904‚Äì1905), being promoted to captain on 4 October 1909. =Second Balkan War and World War I= In the summer of 1913 he saw action with the 1st Cavalry Division in the military campaign in Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War. He was promoted to major on 1 April 1916, and served in World War I during the Romanian Campaign of 1916 with the 5th Regiment CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi. For his bravery and skill during the fighting with the German forces at the Carpathian mountain passes he was awarded on 10 January 1917 the Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd Class. In 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel; he served as Chief of Staff for the 2nd Cavalry Division until 1 September 1918, and was promoted to colonel in 1919. =The Interwar period= On 27 May 1920 RƒÉdescu was appointed adjutant of King Ferdinand, after which he served as military attach√© in London (1926‚Äì1928). Upon his return, he was promoted in March 1928 to brigadier general. He served as commanding officer of the 4th Brigade Ro»ôiori, after which he was attached to the Inspectorate-General of Cavalry, and then commanded the 1st Cavalry Division (1931‚Äì1933). He resigned from the Army on 5 February 1933 and transferred to the retired reserves. Upon presenting his resignation, he accused \\"profiteering politicians\\" and King Carol II's camarilla of commercializing military life. That same month RƒÉdescu joined the People's Party of Marshal Alexandru Averescu. In the mid-1930s, he became involved in nationalist politics; he supported a far right movement called Cruciada Rom√¢nismului (\\"The Crusade of Romanianism\\"), aimed at the cultural \\"Romanization\\" of Germans and Hungarians in Transylvania. This short-lived movement was a splinter group of the Iron Guard, created by Mihai Stelescu. After Stelescu was assassinated in July 1936 by an Iron Guard death squad, RƒÉdescu became a leader of the movement, which quickly faded afterwards. Because of his political stances and his opinions regarding the royal camarilla, he started being monitored by the secret police (Siguran»õa Statului). =World War II and the rise of Communism= RƒÉdescu and King Michael I listening to Simion Stoilow, Rector of the University of Bucharest, at the opening celebration for the 1945‚Äì1946 academic year After King Carol II abdicated in September 1940, RƒÉdescu charged dictator Ion Antonescu with collaborating with the Nazis. In 1942, RƒÉdescu wrote an article critical of the German ambassador Manfred Freiherr von Killinger and his constant intrusion in the internal affairs of Romania. He was interned as a political prisoner in the T√¢rgu Jiu camp. On 23 August 1944, immediately after Antonescu's downfall in King Michael's Coup, RƒÉdescu was released from prison. On 15 October he was appointed Chief of the Romanian General Staff at the insistence of the Soviet government, which favored him for his independence and his reputation as an ardent anti-fascist who was respected by the people. He became prime minister on 7 December 1944. The Soviet government initially supported him; on a visit to Bucharest, the Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrey Vyshinsky, publicly expressed Soviet confidence in the RƒÉdescu government. Soon after the situation changed, as conflicts over the armistice agreement emerged, especially over Moscow's demand $300 million in reparations; RƒÉdescu also resisted the Soviet order to deport Germans from Romania to the Soviet Union. He tried to adopt strong anti-Communist policies modeled on those of the George Papandreou Greek government. At the end of February 1945, the Communist Party of Romania and its allies organised a mass rally in front of the Royal Palace to call for his resignation. As the protest carried on, unknown persons opened fire from the Interior Ministry building situated across the street, killing some ten persons. Held responsible for this by the Soviets and the Romanian Communists, RƒÉdescu was forced to resign. Vyshinsky, at the direction of Joseph Stalin, warned that the Soviet Union would not allow Northern Transylvania to be awarded back to Romania if RƒÉdescu were to remain prime minister. He resigned his position on 1 March. On 6 March 1945, the first Communist-dominated government of Romania took office under the direction of Petru Groza. Over the next few years, the Communists completely consolidated their power. =Exile in the West= In 1945, pursued by the Communist authorities, RƒÉdescu sought refuge in the British legation, stayed there for about two months, and was then handed over to Romanian authorities, who had guaranteed his safety but placed him under house arrest. In June 1946, he managed to flee on board a plane to the British Crown colony of Cyprus, where he was detained by the authorities until the Paris Peace Treaties were signed. Via Lisbon and Paris he ended up in the United States. Once in America, he and other exiled Romanian political figures, including Augustin Popa, Mihail FƒÉrcƒÉ»ôanu, Grigore Gafencu, and Constantin Vi»ôoianu, came together to form a united anti-communist opposition in exile called the Romanian National Committee. In 1950, after disagreements within the Committee, he was one of the founders of the Liga Rom√¢nilor Liberi (\\"The League of Free Romanians\\"), together with Grigore Gafencu, Nicolae Caranfil, Mihail FƒÉrcƒÉ»ôanu, Carol \\"Citta\\" Davila, Viorel V. Tilea, general Ion Gheorghe, and VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu. RƒÉdescu died on 16 May 1953 in New York City. At the initiative of Prime Minister Mugur IsƒÉrescu, the remains of General RƒÉdescu were brought back to Romania in 2000. Following the wishes expressed in his testament, he was reburied at the Orthodox Bellu Cemetery in Bucharest on 23 November 2000.

Mantell, a Kentucky Air National Guard pilot, died in the crash of his P-51 Mustang fighter, after being sent in pursuit of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The event was among the most publicized early UFO incidents. Later investigation by the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book indicated that Mantell may have died chasing a Skyhook balloon, which in 1948 was a top-secret project that Mantell would not have known about.Ruppelt, p. 56. Mantell pursued the object in a steep climb, and disregarded suggestions to level his altitude. At high altitude he blacked out from a lack of oxygen, his plane went into a downward spiral, and crashed. In 1956, Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt (the first head of Project Blue Book) wrote that the Mantell crash was one of three \\"classic\\" UFO cases in 1948 that would help to define the UFO phenomenon in the public mind, and would help convince some Air Force intelligence specialists that UFOs were a \\"real,\\" physical phenomenon.Ruppelt, p. 30. The other two \\"classic\\" sightings in 1948 were the Chiles-Whitted UFO encounter and the Gorman dogfight.Ruppelt, pp. 44‚Äì45. Historian David M. Jacobs argues the Mantell case marked a sharp shift in both public and governmental perceptions of UFOs. Previously, the news media often treated UFO reports with a whimsical or glib attitude reserved for ‚Äúsilly season news.‚Äù Following Mantell's death, however, Jacobs notes \\"the fact that a person had died in an encounter with an alleged flying saucer dramatically increased public concern about the phenomenon. Now a dramatic new prospect entered thought about UFOs: they might be not only extraterrestrial but potentially hostile as well.\\"Jacobs, p. 45. Incident Three F-51D Mustang of the 165th Fighter Squadron, the unit in which Mantell was serving Thomas Mantell was an experienced pilot; his flight history consisted of 2,167 hours flying time, and he had been honored for his part in the Battle of Normandy during World War II. On 7 January 1948, Godman Army Airfield at Fort Knox, Kentucky, received a report from the Kentucky Highway Patrol of an unusual aerial object near Madisonville, Kentucky. Reports of a westbound circular object, in diameter, were received from Owensboro and Irvington. At about 1:45 p.m., Sergeant Quinton Blackwell saw an object from his position in the control tower at Fort Knox. Two other witnesses in the tower also reported a white object in the distance. Colonel Guy Hix, the base commander, reported an object he described as \\"very white,\\" and \\"about one fourth the size of the full moon ... Through binoculars it appeared to have a red border at the bottom ... It remained stationary, seemingly, for one and a half hours.\\" Observers at Clinton County Army Air Field in Ohio described the object \\"as having the appearance of a flaming red cone trailing a gaseous green mist\\" and observed the object for around 35 minutes. Another observer at Lockbourne Army Air Field in Ohio noted, \\"Just before leaving it came to very near the ground, staying down for about ten seconds, then climbed at a very fast rate back to its original altitude, 10,000 feet, leveling off and disappearing into the overcast heading 120 degrees. Its speed was greater than in level flight.\\" Four F-51D Mustangs of C Flight, 165th Fighter Squadron Kentucky Air National Guard‚Äîone piloted by Mantell‚Äîwere already in the air and told to approach the object. Blackwell was in radio communication with the pilots throughout the event. One pilot's Mustang was low on fuel, and he quickly returned to base. Ruppelt notes that there was some disagreement amongst the air traffic controllers as to Mantell's words as he communicated with the tower: some sourcesquoted in Michael D. Swords' (2000) \\"Project Sign and the Estimate of the Situation \\" reported that Mantell had described an object \\"[which] looks metallic and of tremendous size,\\" but according to Ruppelt, others disputed whether or not Mantell actually said this.Ruppelt, p. 48. The other two pilots accompanied Mantell in steep pursuit of the object. They later reported they saw an object, but described it as so small and indistinct that they could not identify it. Mantell ignored suggestions that the pilots should level their altitude and try to more clearly see the object. Only one of Mantell's wingmen, Lt. Albert Clements, had an oxygen mask, and his oxygen was in low supply. Clements and the third pilot, Lt. Hammond, called off their pursuit at . Mantell continued to climb, however. According to the Air Force, once Mantell passed he blacked out from the lack of oxygen (hypoxia), and his plane began spiraling back towards the ground. A witness later reported Mantell's Mustang in a circling descent. His plane crashed on a farm south of Franklin, Kentucky, on the Kentucky‚ÄìTennessee state line.Peebles, p. 23. Firemen later pulled Mantell's body from the Mustang's wreckage. His seat belt was shredded, and his wristwatch had stopped at 3:18 p.m., the time of his crash. Meanwhile, by 3:50 p.m. the UFO was no longer visible to observers at Godman Army Airfield. The Mantell incident was reported by newspapers around the nation, and received significant news media attention. A number of sensational rumors were also circulated about Mantell's crash. According to UFO historian Curtis Peebles, among the rumors were claims that \\"the flying saucer was a Soviet missile; it was [an alien] spacecraft that shot down [Mantell's fighter] when it got too close; Captain Mantell's body was found riddled with bullets; the body was missing; the plane had completely disintegrated in the air; [and] the wreckage was radioactive.\\"Peebles, p. 24. However, no evidence has ever surfaced to substantiate any of these claims, and Air Force investigation specifically refuted some claims, such as the supposedly radioactive wreckage. Captain Ruppelt wrote that \\"I had always heard a lot of wild speculation about the condition of Mantell's crashed F-51, so I wired for a copy of the accident report. [It] said that...Mantell's body had not burned, not disintegrated, and was not full of holes; the wreck was not radioactive, nor was it magnetized.\\"Ruppelt, pp. 52‚Äì53. Mantell was the first member of the Kentucky Air National Guard to die in flight. According to John Trowbridge, historian of the Kentucky National Guard, \\"There is a real X-Files twist to this, too. Mantell lived almost his entire life in Louisville, but he was born in a hospital in Franklin, only a few miles from where he was killed.\\" Venus explanation and rejection The Mantell crash was investigated by Project Sign, the first Air Force research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. One writer noted that \\"The people on Project Sign worked fast on the Mantell Incident. Contemplating a flood of queries from the press as soon as they heard about the crash, they realized that they had to get a quick answer. Venus had been the target of a chase by an Air Force F-51 several weeks before and there were similarities between this sighting and the Mantell Incident. So...the word 'Venus' went out. Mantell had unfortunately been killed trying to reach the planet Venus.\\"Ruppelt, p. 49. An Air Force major who was interviewed by several reporters following Mantell's crash \\"flatly stated that it was Venus.\\"Ruppelt, p. 50. In 1952 USAF Captain Edward Ruppelt, the supervisor of Project Blue Book, Project Sign's successor, was ordered to reinvestigate the Mantell Incident. Ruppelt spoke with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer at Ohio State University and scientific consultant to Project Sign and Project Blue Book. Hynek had supplied Project Sign with the Venus explanation in 1948, mainly because Venus had been in the same place in the sky that Mantell's UFO was observed.Ruppelt, p. 51. However, by 1952 Dr. Hynek had concluded that the Venus explanation was incorrect, because \\"Venus wasn't bright enough to be seen\\" by Mantell and the other witnesses, and because a considerable haze was present that would have further obscured the planet in the sky. Ruppelt also noted Dr. Hynek's statement that Venus, even if visible, would have been a \\"pinpoint of light\\", but that eyewitness \\"descriptions plainly indicated a large object. None of the descriptions could even vaguely be called a pinpoint of light.\\"Ruppelt, p. 52. Skyhook balloon explanation Having rejected the Venus explanation, Captain Ruppelt began to research other explanations for the incident. He was particularly interested in a suggestion by Dr. Hynek that Mantell could have misidentified a United States Navy Skyhook weather balloon. In Madisonville, Kentucky \\"the object was seen through a telescope [and] identified as a balloon by one observer.\\"(Peebles, pp. 23-24) Additionally, between 4:30 and 4:45 PM an astronomer at Vanderbilt University \\"watched an object in the sky...viewed through binoculars, he said it was a pear-shaped balloon with cables and a basket attached.\\"(Peebles, p. 24) However, others disputed this idea, noting that no particular Skyhook balloon could be conclusively identified as being in the area in question during Mantell's pursuit. Despite this objection, Ruppelt thought the Skyhook explanation was plausible: the balloons were a secret Navy project at the time of Mantell's crash, were made of reflective aluminum, and were about in diameter, consistent with the description of the UFO as large, metallic, and cone-shaped. Since the Skyhook balloons were secret at the time, neither Mantell nor the other observers in the air control tower would have been able to identify the UFO as a Skyhook. But this was never proved, as Ruppelt wrote: Inexperience with the P-51 Researcherssee Clark, 1998. have also noted that while Mantell was an experienced pilot, he was rather new to the P-51, and that this relative inexperience could have been a factor in the crash. This does not, of course, account for the identity of the UFO. Thomas Mantell biography Captain Thomas Francis Mantell Jr. (30 June 1922 ‚Äì 7 January 1948) was a United States Air Force officer and a World War II veteran. Mantell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for courageous action during Operation Market Garden, and an Air Medal with three Oak leaf clusters for aerial achievement. =Career= Mantell graduated from Male High School in Louisville. On 16 June 1942, Mantell joined the United States Army Air Corps, finishing Flight School on 30 June 1943. During World War II, he was a C-47 Skytrain pilot assigned to the 96th Troop Carrier Squadron, 440th Troop Carrier Group, which air dropped the 101st Airborne Division into Normandy, France on 6 June 1944 and participated in Operation Market Garden. Mantell, then a lieutenant, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism while flying over Holland on 18 September 1944 during Operation Market Garden. He was the pilot of a C-47 named Vulture's Delight, towing a glider, when it came under heavy anti-aircraft fire. All but one of the rudder and elevator controls were disabled, and the aircraft's tail was afire. Mantell's crew chief fought the fire with live ammunition detonating. Rather than release the glider, Lt. Mantell decided to continue with his mission. The glider was released at the correct location, and Mantell returned to base. Upon inspection, his aircraft was so damaged that it appeared to be unable to fly. Mantell was nicknamed \\"Shiny\\" by his comrades. This was because of his \\"constant well-scrubbed look.\\" Mantell was also described as \\"able to think fast and act quickly.\\" http://www.nicap.org/docs/mantell/mantell7.htm After the war, Mantell returned to Louisville, joining the newly formed Kentucky Air National Guard on 16 February 1947. He became a F-51D Mustang pilot in the 165th Fighter Squadron. Following his death in January 1948, Mantell's remains were sent to Louisville for burial in the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery. Captain Thomas F Mantell, Jr. Marker in Franklin, KY about the crash of his aircraft and death in pursuit of a UFO in 1948. On 29 September 2001, the Simpson County Historical Society unveiled a historical marker in honor of Thomas Mantell in his hometown of Franklin. The marker is located at the exit off Interstate 65. =Awards= * Pilot Badge * Distinguished Flying Cross * Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters * Distinguished Unit Citation * American Campaign Medal * European‚ÄìAfrican‚ÄìMiddle Eastern Campaign Medal with two campaign stars * World War II Victory Medal Legacy The Mantell incident is one of the earliest UFO incidents to attract widespread public attention. It is considered one of the \\"classic\\" UFO incidents from the late 1940s. The Mantell incident was featured in the 1956 quasi-documentary Unidentified Flying Objects: The True Story of Flying Saucers. The film helped spur public interest in UFOs and speculation that UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin. The incident was also featured in the 1975 Toei Animation film Kore ga UFO da! Soratobu Enban(„Åì„Çå„ÅåÔºµÔº¶ÔºØ„Å†ÔºÅ Á©∫È£õ„Å∂ÂÜÜÁõ§), albeit with several inaccuracies--for example, the UFO is shown as a disc rather than a cone.

It was formerly the related unit of mass (the Ottoman dram) in the Ottoman Empire and the Sasanian Empire. The name derives from the name of the ancient Greek currency, drachma.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st edition, s.v. 'dirhem' Unit of mass The dirham was a unit of weight used across North Africa, the Middle East, and Persia, with varying values. In the late Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Turkish ÿØÿ±ŸáŸÖ), the standard dirham was 3.207 g;based on an oka of 1.2828 kg; Diran K√©l√©kian gives 3.21 g (Dictionnaire Turc-Fran√ßais, Constantinople: Imprimerie Mihran, 1911) ; Œì.

The Ottoman dirham was based on the Sasanian drachm (in Middle Persian: drahm), which was itself based on the Roman dram/drachm. In Egypt in 1895, it was equivalent to 47.661 troy grains (3.088 g).OED There is currently a movement within the Islamic world to revive the Dirham as a unit of mass for measuring silver, although the exact value is disputed (either 3 or 2.975 grams). History Silver hoard from Lublin-Czech√≥w, comprising 214 silver dirhams issued between 711/712 and 882/883 AD, Lublin Museum. The word \\"dirham\\" ultimately comes from drachma (Œ¥œÅŒ±œáŒºŒÆ), the Greek coin. The Greek- speaking Byzantine Empire controlled the Levant and traded with Arabia, circulating the coin there in pre-Islamic times and afterward. It was this currency which was initially adopted as a Persian word (Middle Persian drahm or dram); then near the end of the 7th century the coin became an Islamic currency bearing the name of the sovereign and a religious verse. The \\"dirham\\" was the coin of the Persians. The Arabs tried to introduced their own coin however, due to the lack of trust of the currency the persian Dirham was kept as the currency BBC Art of Persia. The dirham was struck in many Mediterranean countries, including Al-Andalus (Moorish Spain) and the Byzantine Empire (miliaresion), and could be used as currency in Europe between the 10th and 12th centuries, notably in areas with Viking connections, such as Viking YorkIn addition to Islamic dirhams in ninth and tenth century English hoards, a counterfeit dirham was found at Coppergate, in York, struck as if for Isma'il ibn Achmad (ruling at Samarkand, 903-07/8), of copper covered by a once-silvery wash of tin (illustrated in Richard Hall, Viking Age Archaeology, [series Shire Archaeology] 2010:17, fig. 7). and Dublin. =Dirham in Jewish orthodox law= The dirham is frequently mentioned in Jewish orthodox law as a unit of weight used to measure various requirements in religious functions, such as the weight in silver specie pledged in Marriage Contracts (Ketubbah), the quantity of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion, etc. Jewish physician and philosopher, Maimonides, uses the Egyptian dirham to approximate the quantity of flour for dough-portion, writing in Mishnah Eduyot 1:2: \\"...And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty dirhams of wheat flour, while all these dirhams are the Egyptian [dirham].\\" This view is repeated by Maran's Shulhan Arukh (Hil. Hallah, Yoreh Deah ¬ß 324:3) in the name of the Tur. In Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah (Eduyot 1:2, note 18), Rabbi Yosef Qafih explains that the weight of each Egyptian dirham was approximately 3.333 grams,Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, ed.

It was created in 1620 for Sir Oliver St John, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. He was the descendant and namesake of Oliver St John, whose elder brother Sir John St John was the ancestor of the Barons St John of Bletso and the Earls of Bolingbroke. Moreover, St John's nephew Sir John St John, 1st Baronet, of Lydiard Tregoze, was the ancestor of the Viscounts Bolingbroke and the Viscounts St John. At the time of its creation in 1620, the Grandison viscountcy was given special remainder to the male issue of his niece Barbara Villiers. She was the wife of Sir Edward Villiers, the elder half-brother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey and John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck. In 1626 the 1st Viscount Grandison was also created Baron Tregoz in the Peerage of England, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. On his death in 1630 the barony of Tregoz became extinct as he left no male heirs. He was succeeded in the viscountcy according to the special remainder by William Villiers, the eldest son of Barbara and Sir Edward Villiers. William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison (1614‚Äì1643) was a supporter of King Charles I and died of wounds received at the Battle of Bristol in 1643. His daughter the Hon. Barbara Villiers, became the mistress of King Charles II and was created Duchess of Cleveland in 1670. The second Viscount Grandison had had no sons and was succeeded in the viscountcy by his younger brother, the third Viscount. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Viscount. On his death the title passed to his grandson, the fifth Viscount. He was the son of Brigadier-General the Hon. Edward Villiers (died 1693), eldest son of the fourth Viscount. In 1721 the fifth Viscount was created Earl Grandison in the Peerage of Ireland. However, he left no surviving male heirs and the earldom became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the Grandison viscountcy by his second cousin William Villiers, 3rd Earl of Jersey, who became the sixth Viscount. Lord Jersey was the great-grandson of Sir Edward Villiers, fifth son of Barbara and Sir Edward Villiers. See the Earl of Jersey for further history of the viscountcy. In 1746 Elizabeth Mason, daughter of John Villiers, 1st Earl Grandison, was created Viscountess Grandison, and in 1767 she was made Viscountess Villiers and Countess Grandison. All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. However, they became extinct on the death of the second Earl in 1800.
